CKNOWLEDGMENTS
To Richard D. Kirkpatrick, my father, and ex-portfolio manager for Fidelity beginning in the
1950s. He introduced me to technical analysisthe age of 14 by asking me to update his charts. In
the year of his retirement, 1968, he managed the best-performing mutual fund in the world.
To the Market Technicians Association, through which I have met many of the best innova-
ptg
tors and practitioners of technical analysis, and especially to staff members Cassandra Townes
and Marie Penza for their support and assistance in making available the MTA library.
To Skip Cave, past dean of the Fort Lewis College School of Business Administration, for
allowing me to assist him in teaching a course in technical analysis, for getting this project going
by introducing me to other textbook authors, such as the Assistant Dean Roy Cook, and for pro-
viding office space during the initial writing and researching for this book.
To Thomas Harrington, past dean of the Fort Lewis College School of Business Adminis-
tration, for allowing me to maintain an office at the college, for allowing me special privileges at
the college library, and for asking me to continue teaching a course in technical analysis.
To my students in class BA317 at Fort Lewis College School of Business Administration,
for being my teaching guinea pigs and for keeping me on my toes with questions and observa-
tions.
To my friends and colleagues at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, specifically Vinnie
Casella, past president, who taught me from the inside how markets really work.
To the dedicated people at Pearson Education, specifically Jim Boyd, executive editor;
Pamela Boland, editorial assistant; Betsy Harris, production editor; Karen Annett, copy editor;
and all the others behind the scenes who I have not known directly.
To Phil Roth and Bruce Kamich, both past presidents of the Market Technicians Associa-
tion, professional technical analysts, and adjunct professors teaching courses in technical analy-
sis at universities in the New York area, for editing the material in this book and keeping me in
line.
To Julie Dahlquist, my coauthor, and her husband, Richard Bauer, both professors steeped
in the ways of academia, for bringing that perspective to this book.
To my wife, Ellie, who has had to put up with me for 48 years and has always done so
pleasantly and with love.

Acknowledgments xxv
To my children, Abby, Andy, Bear, and Bradlee, for their love and support.
And to my grandchildren, India and Mila, who didn’t do anything for the book but who
pleaded to be mentioned.
I thank you and all the many others from my lifetime of work in technical analysis for
your support, friendship, and willingness to impart your knowledge of trading markets.
Charles Kirkpatrick
Kittery, Maine
The assistance and support of many people contributed to turning the dream of this book into a
reality. Fred Meissner was the one who initially introduced me to my coauthor, Charlie, at a Mar-
ket Technicians Association chapter meeting. After I worked with Charlie on several projects and
we served together on the Market Technicians Association Educational Foundation Board, he
bravely agreed to a partnership in writing this book. Charlie has been the ideal coauthor—posi-
tive, patient, and persistent. It has been an honor to work with someone so knowledgeable and an
incredible experience to work with someone so willing to share his knowledge.
The faculty and staff in the Department of Finance at the University of Texas at San Anto-
nio College of Business have been a pleasure to work with over the past couple of years while ptg
this book has been in process. Keith Fairchild, Lula Misra, and Robert Lengel have been espe-
cially supportive.
The expertise of the dedicated team at Pearson Education has been invaluable in helping
Charlie and me get our ideas into this final format. Thanks to Jim Boyd, Pamela Boland, Betsy
Harris, Karen Annett, and the entire Pearson Education team for their gentle prodding, their con-
tinued encouragement, and their tireless commitment to this project.
My husband, Richard Bauer, assisted in more ways than can ever be counted. He gra-
ciously wrote the Basic Statistics appendix for this book. He served as a sounding board for
many of the ideas in this book. He read drafts and made many helpful suggestions to the manu-
script. However, his support goes far beyond his professional expertise. Richard untiringly took
care of many household tasks as I spent time working on this project. His help made it easy for
me to travel to meet with Charlie and work on this project. I am blessed to receive his unwaver-
ing emotional support and encouragement.
My two children have also been a source of blessing and inspiration. They demonstrated
extreme patience through this entire process. They also reminded me of the need for fun, laugh-
ter, and a good hug whenever I was tempted to work too hard. Discussing stock charts with my
eleven-year-old son, Sepp, made this project much more interesting than it would have otherwise
been. Writing next to my fourteen-year-old daughter and budding author, Katherine, made the
countless hours of tedious work much more enjoyable.

Technical analysis—these words may conjure up many different mental images. Perhaps you
think of the stereotypical technical analyst, alone in a windowless office, slouched over stacks of
hand-drawn charts of stock prices. Or, maybe you think of the sophisticated multicolored com-
puterized chart of your favorite stock you recently saw. Perhaps you begin dreaming about all the
money you could make if you knew the secrets to predicting stock prices. Or, perhaps you
ptg
remember sitting in a finance class and hearing your professor say that technical analysis “is a
waste of time.” In this book, we examine some of the perceptions, and misperceptions, of techni-
cal analysis.
If you are new to the study of technical analysis, you might be wondering just what techni-
cal analysis is. In its basic form, technical analysis is the study of prices in freely traded markets
with the intent of making profitable trading or investment decisions. Technical analysis is rooted
in basic economic theory. Consider the basic assumptions presented by Robert D. Edwards and
John Magee in the classic book, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends:
• Stock prices are determined solely by the interaction of demand and supply.
• Stock prices tend to move in trends.
• Shifts in demand and supply cause reversals in trends.
• Shifts in demand and supply can be detected in charts.
• Chart patterns tend to repeat themselves.
Technical analysts study the action of the market itself rather than the goods in which the
market deals. The technical analyst believes that “the market is always correct.” In other words,
rather than trying to consider all the factors that will influence the demand for Gadget Interna-
tional’s newest electronic gadget and all the items that will influence the company’s cost and
supply curve to determine an outlook for the stock’s price, the technical analyst believes that all
of these factors are already factored into the demand and supply curves and, thus, the price of the
company’s stock. We find that stock prices (and prices for any security in freely traded markets)

are influenced by psychological factors as well, most of them indecipherable. Greed, fear, cogni-
tive bias, misinformation, expectations, and other factors enter into the price of a security, mak-
ing the analysis of the factors nearly impossible. The technical analyst, thus, disregards all these
imponderables and studies how the marketplace is accepting the multitude of exogenous infor-
mation and beliefs with the intention of finding secrets in that action that have predictive poten-
tial.
Students new to any discipline often ask, “How can I use the knowledge of this disci-
pline?” Students new to technical analysis are no different. Technical analysis is used in two
major ways: predictive and reactive. Those who use technical analysis for predictive purposes
use the analysis to make predictions about future market moves. Generally, these individuals
make money by selling their predictions to others. Market letter writers in print or on the Web
and the technical market gurus who frequent the financial news fall into this category. The pre-
dictive technical analysts include the more well-known names in the industry; these individuals
like publicity because it helps market their services.
On the other hand, those who use technical analysis in a reactive mode are usually not well
known. Traders and investors use techniques of technical analysis to react to particular market
conditions to make their decisions. For example, a trader may use a moving average crossover to
signal when a long position should be taken. In other words, the trader is watching the market
and reacting when a certain technical condition is met. These traders and investors are making ptg
money by making profitable trades for their own or clients’ portfolios. Some of them may even
find that publicity distracts them from their underlying work.
The focus of this book is to explain the basic principles and techniques for reacting to the
market. We do not attempt to predict the market, nor do we provide you with the Holy Grail or a
promise of a method that will make you millions overnight. Instead, we want to provide you with
background, basic tools, and techniques that you will need to be a competent technical analyst.
As we will see when we study the history of technical analysis, the interest in technical
analysis in the United States dates back over 150 years, when Charles H. Dow began to write
newsletters that later turned into the Wall Street Journal and developed the various Dow averages
to measure the stock market. Since that time, much has been written about technical analysis.
Today, there are entire periodicals, such as the Technical Analysis of Stock and Commodities and
the Journal of Technical Analysis, devoted to the study of the subject. In addition, there are many
articles appearing in other publications, including academic journals. There are even a number of
excellent books on the market. As you can see from this book’s extensive bibliography, which is
in no way a complete list of every published item on technical analysis, a massive quantity of
material about technical analysis exists.
So, why does the world need another book on technical analysis? We began looking
through the multitude of materials on technical analysis a few years ago, searching for resources
to use in educational settings. We noticed that many specialized books existed on the topic, but
there was no resource to provide the student of technical analysis with a comprehensive summa-
tion of the body of knowledge. We decided to provide a coherent, logical framework for this
material that could be used as a textbook and a reference book.
Our intent in writing this book is to provide the student of technical analysis, whether a
novice college student or an experienced practitioner, with a systematic study of the field of tech-
nical analysis. Over the past century, much has been written about the topic. The classic works of

Chapter 1 Introduction to Technical Analysis 5
Charles Dow and the timeless book by Edwards and Magee still contain valuable information for
the student of technical analysis. The basic principles of these early authors are still valid today.
However, the evolving financial marketplace and the availability of computer power have led to
a substantial growth in the new tools and information available to the technical analyst.
Many technical analysts have learned their trade from the mentors with whom they have
worked. Numerous individuals who are interested in studying technical analysis today, however,
do not have access to such a mentor. In addition, as the profession has advanced, many specific
techniques have developed. The result is that the techniques and methods of technical analysis
often appear to be a hodgepodge of tools, ideas, and even folklore, rather than a part of a coher-
ent body of knowledge.
Many books on the market assume a basic understanding of technical analysis or focus on
particular financial markets or instruments. Our intent is to provide the reader with a basic refer-
ence to support a lifelong study of the discipline. We have attempted to provide enough back-
ground information and terminology that you can easily read this book without having to refer to
other references for background information. We have also included a large number of references
for further reading so that you can continue learning in the specialized areas that interest you.
Another unique characteristic of this book is the joining of the practitioner and the aca-
demic. Technical analysis is widely practiced, both by professional traders and investors and by
individuals managing their own money. However, this widespread practice has not been matched ptg
by academic acknowledgment of the benefits of technical analysis. Academics have been slow to
study technical analysis; most of the academic studies of technical analysis have lacked a thor-
ough understanding of the actual practice of technical analysis. It is our hope not only to bring
together a practitioner-academic author team but also to provide a book that promotes discussion
and understanding between these two groups.
Whether you are a novice or experienced professional, we are confident that you will find
this book helpful. For the student new to technical analysis, this book will provide you with the
basic knowledge and building blocks to begin a lifelong study of technical analysis. For the more
experienced technician, you will find this book to be an indispensable guide, helping you to
organize your knowledge, question your assumptions and beliefs, and implement new tech-
niques.
We begin this book with a look at the background and history of technical analysis. In this
part, we discuss not only the basic principles of technical analysis but also the technical analysis
controversy—the debate between academics and practitioners regarding the efficiency of finan-
cial markets and the merit of technical analysis. This background information is especially use-
ful to those who are new to technical analysis and those who are studying the subject in an
educational setting. For those with more experience with the field or with little interest in the
academic arguments about market efficiency, a quick reading of this first part will probably suf-
fice.
In the second part of the book, we focus on markets and market indicators. Chapter 5, “An
Overview of Markets,” provides a basic overview of how markets work. Market vocabulary and
trading mechanics are introduced in this chapter. For the student who is unfamiliar with this ter-
minology, a thorough understanding of this chapter will provide the necessary background for
the remaining chapters. Our focus in Chapter 6, “Dow Theory,” is on the development and prin-
ciples of Dow Theory. Although Dow Theory was developed a century ago, much of modern-day

6 Part I Introduction
technical analysis is based on these classic principles. A thorough understanding of these time-
less principles helps keep the technical analyst focused on the key concepts that lead to making
money in the market. In Chapter 7, “Sentiment,” we focus on sentiment; the psychology of mar-
ket players is a major concept in this chapter. In Chapter 8, “Measuring Market Strength,” we
discuss methods for gauging overall market strength. Chapter 9, “Temporal Patterns and Cycles,”
focuses on temporal tendencies, the tendency for the market to move in particular directions dur-
ing particular times, such as election year cycles and seasonal stock market patterns. Because the
main fuel for the market is money, Chapter 10, “Flow of Funds,” focuses on the flow of funds. In
this chapter, we look at measures of market liquidity and how the Federal Reserve can influence
liquidity.
The third part of the book focuses on trend analysis. In many ways, this part can be thought
of as the heart of technical analysis. If we see that the market is trending upward, we can prof-
itably ride that trend upward. If we determine that the market is trending downward, we can even
profit by taking a short position. In fact, the most difficult time to profit in the market is when
there is no definitive upward or downward trend. Over the years, technical analysts have devel-
oped a number of techniques to help them visually determine when a trend is in place. These
charting techniques are the focus of Chapter 11, “History and Construction of Charts.” In Chap-
ter 12, “Trends—The Basics,” we discuss how to draw trend lines and determine support and
resistance lines using these charts. In Chapter 13, “Breakouts, Stops, and Retracements,” we ptg
focus on determining breakouts. These breakouts will help us recognize a trend change as soon
as possible. We also discuss the importance of protective stops in this chapter. Moving averages,
a useful mathematical technique for determining the existence of trends, are presented in Chap-
ter 14, “Moving Averages.”
The fourth part of this book focuses on chart pattern analysis—the item that first comes to
mind when many people think of technical analysis. In Chapter 15, “Bar Chart Patterns,” we
cover classic bar chart patterns; in Chapter 16, “Point-and-Figure Chart Patterns,” we focus on
point-and-figure chart patterns. Short-term patterns, including candlestick patterns, are covered
in Chapter 17, “Short-Term Patterns.”
Part V, “Trend Confirmation,” deals with the concept of confirmation. We consider price
oscillators and momentum measures in Chapter 18, “Confirmation.” Building upon the concept
of trends from earlier chapters, we look at how volume plays a role in confirming the trend, giv-
ing us more confidence that a trend is indeed occurring. We also look at oscillators and indexes
of momentum to analyze other means of confirming price trend.
Next, we turn our attention to the relationship between cycle theory and technical analysis.
In Chapter 19, “Cycles,” we discuss the basic principles of cycle theory and the characteristics of
cycles. Some technical analysts believe that cycles seen in the stock market have a scientific
basis; for example, R. N. Elliott claimed that the basic harmony found in nature occurs in the
stock market. Chapter 20, “Elliott, Fibonacci, and Gann,” introduces the basic concepts of Elliott
Wave Theory, a school of thought that adheres to Elliott’s premise that stock price movements
form discernible wave patterns.
Once we know the basic techniques of technical analysis, the question becomes, “Which
particular securities will we trade?” Selection decisions are the focus of Chapter 21, “Selection
of Markets and Issues: Trading and Investing.” In this chapter, we discuss the intermarket rela-
tionships that will help us determine on which market to focus by determining which market is

most likely to show strong performance. We also discuss individual security selection, measures
of relative strength, and how successful practitioners have used these methods to construct port-
folios.
As technical analysts, we need methods of measuring our success. After all, our main
objective is making money. Although this is a straightforward objective, determining whether we
are meeting our objective is not quite so straightforward. Proper measurement of trading and
investment strategies requires appropriate risk measurement and an understanding of basic statis-
tical techniques. The last couple of chapters help put all the tools and techniques we present
throughout the book into practice. Chapter 22, “System Design and Testing,” is devoted to devel-
oping and testing trading systems. At this point, we look at how we can test the tools and indica-
tors covered throughout the book to see if they will make money for us—our main objective—in
the particular way we would like to trade. Finally, Chapter 23, “Money and Risk Management,”
deals with money management and avoiding capital loss.
For those who need a brushup in basic statistics or want to understand some of the statisti-
cal concepts introduced throughout the book, Richard J. Bauer, Jr., Ph.D., CFA, CMT (Professor
of Finance, Bill Greehey School of Business, St. Mary’s University, San Antonio, TX), provides
a tutorial on basic statistical techniques of interest to the technical analyst in Appendix A, “Basic
Statistics.”
For those who are unfamiliar with the terms and language used in trading, Appendix B, ptg
“Types of Orders and Other Trader Terminology,” provides brief definitions of specific order
types and commonly used terms in order entry.
As with all skills, learning technical analysis requires practice. We have provided a number
of review questions and problems at the end of the chapters to help you begin thinking about and
applying some of the concepts on your own. The extensive bibliography will direct you to further
readings in the areas of technical analysis that are of particular interest to you.
Another way of honing your technical skills is participating in a professional organization
that is focused on technical analysis. In the United States, the Market Technicians Association
(MTA) provides a wide variety of seminars, lectures, and publications for technical analysis pro-
fessionals. The MTA also sponsors the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) program. Profes-
sionals wanting to receive the prestigious CMT designation must pass three examinations and
adhere to a strict code of professional conduct. More information about the MTA and the CMT
program may be found at the Web site: www.mta.org. The International Federation of Technical
Analysts, Inc., (IFTA) is a global organization of market analysis societies and associations.
IFTA, and its member associations worldwide, sponsor a number of seminars and publications.
IFTA offers a professional certification, the Certified Financial Technician, and a masters-level
degree, the Master of Financial Technical Analysis. The details of these certifications, along with
contact information for IFTA’s member associations around the world, can be found at their Web
site: www.ifta.org.
Technical analysis is a complex, ever-expanding discipline. The globalization of markets,
the creation of new securities, and the availability of inexpensive computer power are opening
even more opportunities in this field. Whether you use the information professionally or for your
own personal trading or investing, we hope that this book will serve as a stepping-stone to your
study and exploration of the field of technical analysis.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After reading this chapter, you should be able to
• Define the term trend ptg
• Explain why determining the trend is important to the technical analyst
• Distinguish between primary, secondary, short-term, and intraday trends
• Discuss some of the basic beliefs upon which technical analysis is built
The art of technical analysis—for it is an art—is to identify trend changes at an early
stage and to maintain an investment position until the weight of the evidence indi-
cates that the trend has reversed. (Pring, 2002)
Technical analysis is based on one major assumption—trend. Markets trend. Traders and
investors hope to buy a security at the beginning of an uptrend at a low price, ride the trend, and
sell the security when the trend ends at a high price. Although this strategy sounds very simple,
implementing it is exceedingly complex.
For example, what length trend are we discussing? The trend in stock prices since the
Great Depression? The trend in gold prices since 1980? The trend in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA) in the past year? Or, the trend in Merck stock during the past week? Trends exist
in all lengths, from long-term trends that occur over decades to short-term trends that occur from
minute to minute.
Trends of different lengths tend to have the same characteristics. In other words, a trend in
annual data will behave the same as a trend in five-minute data. Investors must choose which
trend is most important for them based on their investment objectives, their personal preferences,
and the amount of time they can devote to watching market prices. One investor might be more
concerned about the business cycle trend that occurs over several years. Another investor might

be more concerned about the trend over the next six months, while a third investor might be most
concerned about the intraday trend. Although individual investors and traders have investment
time horizons that vary greatly, they can use the same basic methods of analyzing trends because
of the commonalities that exist among trends of different lengths.
Trends are obvious in hindsight, but ideally, we would like to spot a new trend right at its
beginning, buy, then spot its end, and sell. However, this ideal never happens, except by luck.
The technical analyst always runs the risk of spotting the beginning of a trend too late and miss-
ing potential profit. The analyst who does not spot the ending of the trend holds the security past
the price peak and fails to capture all of the profits that were possible. On the other hand, if the
analyst thinks the trend has ended before it really has and sells the security prematurely, the ana-
lyst has then lost potential profits. Therefore, the technical analyst spends a lot of time and brain-
power attempting to spot as early as possible when a trend is beginning and ending. This is the
reason for studying charts, moving averages, oscillators, support and resistance, and all the other
techniques we explore in this book.
The fact that market prices trend has been known for thousands of years. Specific records
are available from the eighteenth century in Japan. Academics have disputed that markets tend to
trend because if it were true, it would spoil their theoretical models. Recent academic work has
shown that the old financial models have many problems when applied to the behavior of real
markets. In Chapter 4, “The Technical Analysis Controversy,” we discuss some of the new aca- ptg
demic findings about how market prices behave and some of the evidence against the old finance
theories. Academics and others traditionally have scorned technical analysis as if it were a cult;
as it turns out, however, the almost religious belief in the Efficient Markets Hypothesis has
become a cult itself, with adherents unwilling to accept the enormous amount of evidence
against it. In fact, technical analysis is very old, developed through practical experience with the
trading markets, and has resulted in some sizable fortunes for those following it.
HOW DOES THE TECHNICAL ANALYST MAKE MONEY?
Several requirements are needed to convert pure technical analysis into money. The first and
most important, of course, is to determine when a trend is beginning or ending. The money is
made by “jumping” on the trend as early as possible. Theoretically, this sounds simple, but prof-
iting consistently is not so easy.
The indicators and measurements that technical analysts use to determine the trend are not
crystal balls that perfectly predict the future. Under certain market conditions, these tools might
not work. Also, a trend can suddenly change direction without warning. Thus, it is imperative
that the technical investor be aware of risks and protect against such occurrences causing losses.
From a strategic standpoint, then, the technical investor must decide two things: First, the
investor or trader must choose when to enter a position, and second, he or she must choose when
to exit a position. Choosing when to exit a position is composed of two decisions. The investor
must choose when to exit the position to capture a profit when price moves in the expected direc-
tion. The investor must also choose when to exit the position at a loss when price moves in the
opposite direction from what was expected. The wise investor is aware of the risk that the trend

Chapter 2 The Basic Principle of Technical Analysis—The Trend 11
might differ from what he or she expected. Making the decision of what price level to sell and cut
losses before even entering into a position is a way in which the investor protects against large
losses.
One of the great advantages in technical analysis, because it studies prices, is that a price
point can be established at which the investor knows that something is wrong either with the
analysis or the financial asset’s price behavior. Risk of loss can therefore be determined and
quantified right at the beginning of the investment. This ability is not available to other methods
of investment. Finally, because actual risk can be determined, money management principles can
be applied that will lessen the chance of loss and the risk of what is called “ruin.”
In sum, the basic ways to make money using technical methods are
• “The trend is your friend”—Play the trend.
• Don’t lose—Control capital risk of loss.
• Manage your money—Avoid ruin.
Technical analysis is used to determine the trend, when it is changing, when it has changed, when
to enter a position, when to exit a position, and when the analysis is wrong and the position must
be closed. It’s as simple as that. ptg
WHAT ISA TREND?
What exactly is this trend that the investor wants to ride to make money? A rising trend, or
uptrend, occurs when prices reach higher peaks and higher troughs. An uptrend looks something
like Chart A in Figure 2.1. A declining trend, or downtrend, is the opposite—when prices reach
lower troughs and lower peaks. Chart B in Figure 2.1 shows this downward trend in price. A
sideways or flat trend occurs when prices trade in a range without significant underlying
upward or downward movement. Chart C in Figure 2.1 is an example of a sideways trend; prices
move up and down but on average remain at the same level.
Figure 2.1 shows a theoretical example of an uptrend, downtrend, and sideways trend. But,
defining a trend in the price of real-world securities is not quite that simple. Price movement
does not follow a continuous, uninterrupted line. Small countertrend movements within a trend
can make the true trend difficult to identify at times. Also, remember that there are trends of dif-
fering lengths. Shorter-term trends are parts of longer-term trends.
From a technical analyst’s perspective, a trend is a directional movement of prices that
remains in effect long enough to be identified and still be playable. Anything less makes techni-
cal analysis useless. If a trend is not identified until it is over, we cannot make money from it. If
it is unrecognizable until too late, we cannot make money from it. In retrospect, looking at a
graph of prices, for example, many trends can be identified of varying length and magnitude, but
such observations are observations of history only. A trend must be recognized early and be long
enough for the technician to profit.

HOW ARE TRENDS IDENTIFIED?
There are a number of ways to identify trends. One way to determine a trend in a data set is to run
a linear least-squares regression. This statistical process will provide information about the trend
in security prices. Unfortunately, this particular statistical technique is not of much use to the
technical analyst for trend analysis. The regression method is dependent on a sizable amount of
past price data for accurate results. By the time enough historical price data is accumulated, the

Chapter 2 The Basic Principle of Technical Analysis—The Trend 13
trend is likely beginning to change direction. Despite the tendency for trends to be persistent
enough to profit from, they never last forever.
BOX 2.1 LINEAR LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION
Most spreadsheet software includes a formula for calculating a linear regression line.
It uses two sets of related variables and calculates the “best fit” between the data and
an imaginary straight (linear) line drawn through the data. In standard price analysis,
the two variable data sets are time and price—day d1 and price X1, day d2 and price
X2, and so forth. By fitting a line that best describes the data series, we can deter-
mine a number of things. First, we can measure the amount by which the actual data
varies from the line and, thus, the reliability of the line. Second, we can measure the
slope of the line to determine the rate of change in prices over time, and third, we can
determine when the line began. The line represents the trend in prices over the period
of time studied. It has many useful properties that we will look at later, but for now,
all we need to know is that the line defines the trend over the period studied. Appen-
dix A, “Basic Statistics,” provides more detailed information about least squares
regression. ptg
Many analysts use moving averages to smooth out the shorter and smaller trends within the
trend of interest and identify the longer trends. Chapter 13, “Breakouts, Stops, and Retrace-
ments,” discusses the use of moving averages.
Another method of identifying trends is to look at a graph of prices for extreme points,
tops, and bottoms, separated by reasonable time periods, and to draw lines between these
extreme points (see Figure 2.2). These lines are called trend lines. This traditional method is an
outgrowth of the time before computer graphic software when trend lines were hand drawn. It
still works, however. Using this method to define trends, you must define reversal points. Chap-
ter 12, “Trends—The Basics,” covers several methods of determining reversal points, but most
such points are obvious on a graph of prices. By drawing lines between them, top to top and bot-
tom to bottom, we get a “feeling” of price direction and limits. We also get a “feeling” of slope,
or the rate of change in prices. Trend lines can define limits to price action, which, if broken, can
warn that the trend might be changing.

TRENDS DEVELOP FROM SUPPLY AND DEMAND
As in all markets, whether used cars, grapefruit, real estate, or industrial products, the economic
principle of interaction between supply and demand determines prices in trading markets. Each
buyer (demand) bids for a certain quantity at a certain price, and each seller (supply) offers or
“asks” for a certain quantity at a certain price. When the buyer and seller agree and transact, they
establish a price for that instant in time. The reasons for buying and selling can be complex—
perhaps the seller needs the money, perhaps the seller has learned of unfavorable information,
perhaps the buyer heard a rumor in the golf club locker room—whatever the reason, the price is
established when all of this information is collected, digested, and acted upon through the bid
and offer.

Chapter 2 The Basic Principle of Technical Analysis—The Trend 15
Price, therefore, is the end result of all those inexact factors, and it is the result of the sup-
ply and demand at that instant in time. When prices change, the change is due to a change in
demand and/or supply. The seller might be more anxious; the buyer might have more money to
invest—whatever the reason, the price will change and reflect this change in supply or demand.
The technical analyst, therefore, watches price and price change and does not particularly worry
about the reasons, largely because they are indeterminable.
Remember that many players for many reasons determine supply and demand. In the trad-
ing markets, supply and demand may come from long-term investors accumulating or distribut-
ing a large position or from a small, short-term trader trying to scalp a few points. The number of
players and the number of different reasons for their participation in supply and demand is close
to infinite. Thus, the technical analyst believes it is futile to analyze the components of supply
and demand except through the prices it creates. Where economic information, company infor-
mation, and other information affecting prices is often vague, late, or misplaced, prices are read-
ily available, are extremely accurate, have historic records, and are specific. What better basis is
there for study than this important variable? Furthermore, when one invests or trades, the price is
what determines profit or loss, not corporate earnings nor Federal Reserve policy. The bottom
line, to the technical analyst, is that price is what determines success and, fortunately, for what-
ever reasons, prices tend to trend.

WHAT TRENDS ARE THERE?
The number of trend lengths is unlimited. Investors and traders need to determine which length
they are most interested in, but the methods of determining when a trend begins and ends are the
same regardless of length. This ability for trends to act similarly over different periods is called
the “fractal” nature of trends. Fractal patterns or trends exist in nature along shorelines, in
snowflakes, and elsewhere. For example, a snowflake is always six-sided, having six branches, if
you will. Each branch has a particular, unique pattern made of smaller branches. Using a micro-
scope to look closely at the snowflake, we see that the smaller branches off each larger branch
have the same form as the larger branch. This same shape carries to even smaller and smaller
branches, each of which has the same pattern as the next larger. This is the fractal nature of
snowflakes. The branches, regardless of size, maintain the same pattern. Figure 2.3 shows a com-
puter-generated fractal with each subangle an exact replica of the next larger angle.
The trading markets are similar in that any period we look at—long, medium, or very
short—produces trends with the same characteristics and patterns as each other. Thus, for analy-
sis purposes, the length of the trend is irrelevant because the technical principles are applicable
to all of them. The trend length of interest is determined solely by the time horizon of the investor
or trader.
This is not to say that different trend lengths should be ignored. Because shorter trends
make up longer trends, any analysis of a trend of interest must include analysis of the longer and
shorter trends around it. For example, the trader interested in ten-week trends should also ana-
lyze trends longer than ten weeks because a longer trend will affect the shorter trend. Likewise, a
trend shorter than ten weeks should be analyzed because it will often give early signals of a

change in direction in the larger, ten-week trend. Thus, whatever trend the trader or investor
selects as the trend of interest, the trends of the next longer and next shorter periods should also
be analyzed.

For identification purposes, technical analysts have divided trends into several broad, arbi-
trary categories. These are the primary trend (measured in months or years), the secondary or
intermediate trend (measured in weeks or months), the short-term trend (measured in days), and
the intraday trend (measured in minutes or hours). Except for the intraday trend, Charles H.
Dow, founder of the Dow Jones Company and the Wall Street Journal, first advanced this divi-
sion in the nineteenth century. Charles Dow also was one of the first to identify technical means
of determining when the primary trend had reversed direction. Because of his major contribu-
tions to the field, Dow is known as the “Father” of technical analysis. We will look more closely
at Dow’s contributions in Chapter 3, “History of Technical Analysis,” as we study the history of
technical analysis, and in Chapter 6, “Dow Theory.”

Chapter 2 The Basic Principle of Technical Analysis—The Trend 17
WHAT OTHER ASSUMPTIONS DO TECHNICAL ANALYSTS MAKE?
That markets trend is the basic principle underlying the theory of technical analysis. Of course, it
is the price of the securities that are being monitored that form the trend. Supporting this notion
of trending prices, technical analysts have made several other assumptions that we cover briefly.
First, technical analysts assume that price is determined by the interaction of supply and
demand. As basic economic theory teaches, when demand increases, price goes up, and when
demand decreases, price goes down. One of the factors that determine supply and demand is
buyer and seller expectations. (You do not buy a stock unless you expect it to rise in price.)
Expectations result from human decisions, and decisions are based on information (perceived,
accurate, or otherwise), emotions (greed, fear, and hope), and cognitive limitations such as
behavioral biases, emotions and feelings that originate from the chemistry and electrical connec-
tions within our brains. A new field of study called “neurofinance,” an interdisciplinary study of
the application of neuroscience to investment activity, is finding remarkable connections
between how our brain functions and how we invest.
Second, technical analysts assume that price discounts everything. Price discounts all
information, related to the security or otherwise, as well the interpretation of expectations
derived from that information. This concept was first articulated by Charles H. Dow, later reem-
ptg
phasized by William Peter Hamilton in his Wall Street Journal editorials, and succinctly
described by Robert Rhea (1932), a prominent Dow Theorist, when writing about stock market
averages:
The Averages discount everything: The fluctuations of the daily closing prices of the
Dow-Jones rail and industrial averages afford a composition index of all the hopes,
disappointments, and knowledge of everyone who knows anything of financial mat-
ters, and for that reason the effects of coming events (excluding acts of God) are
always properly anticipated in their movement. The averages quickly appraise such
calamities as fires and earthquakes.
This sounds a little like Eugene Fama’s (1970) famous statement related to the Efficient Markets
Hypothesis (EMH) that “prices fully reflect all available information.” However, Fama was refer-
ring more to information on the specific security and was presuming that all interpretation of that
information was immediately and rationally interpreted. Although technical assumptions include
the price discount assumption of EMH adherents, they go far beyond that simplicity. They
include not only information, both about the security and about all other outside factors that
might influence that security price, but also the interpretation of that information, which might or
might not be rational or directly related, and the expectations derived from that information.
Interpretation, according to technical analysis, is subject to “irrational exuberance” and will
“drive men to excess” as well as to a “corresponding depression” (Hamilton, 1922).

18 Part I Introduction
BOX 2.2 PROFESSOR ANDREW LO’S ADAPTIVE MARKETS HYPOTHESIS
In an attempt to reconcile the existing but different finance ideas of efficient markets
and behavioral finance, Dr. Lo has proposed the “Adaptive Markets Hypothesis”
(2005). Lo proposes a framework based upon the principles of evolution, competi-
tion, adaptation, and natural selection in which markets and players change over
time. The risk-reward relationship is not constant, but changes with market condi-
tions. Thus, investors do not seek to optimize their returns because to do so is too
costly. Decisions instead are made based on experience and “best guesses,” leaving
them subject to interpretative and behavioral bias—namely emotions. As long as the
markets are stable, these methods provide satisfactory results. When the economic
environment changes, however, and the methods fail, the investors then have to adapt
to survive. The size and strength of the different interacting player groups can cause
this environmental change. An example is when the bondholders, during the 1998
Russian government debt default, sought liquidity and upset the investors in previ-
ously stable interest rate spreads, leaving them with failing and illiquid positions.
Those who could rapidly adapt survived. Those who could not, failed. In sum,
investment strategies change and evolve; innovation is the secret of survival; and sur- ptg
vival is the goal rather than maximizing the utility of risk versus return.
Third, an important corollary to the notion that markets trend is the technical analyst’s
belief that prices are nonrandom. As we address further in Chapter 4, if prices are nonrandom,
past prices potentially can be used to predict future price trends. Technical analysts reject the
notion that stock prices are random.
Fourth, technical analysis assumes that history, in principle, will repeat itself (or as Mark
Twain said, “History rhymes: It does not repeat”), and that humans will behave similarly to how
they have in the past in similar circumstances. This similar behavior tends to form into patterns
that have predictable results. These patterns are almost never identical and are, thus, subject to
interpretation, with all its own bias problems, by the technical analyst. This is the most contro-
versial aspect of technical analysis, as well as its most long-standing, and it is only recently being
investigated with sophisticated statistical methods (see Chapter 4).
Fifth, technical analysts also believe that, like trend lines, these patterns are fractal (see
Figure 2.4). Each investor or trader has a specific time frame in which he or she operates. Inter-
estingly, regardless of period, patterns occur with very similar, though not identical, shapes and
characteristics. Thus, an analyst who is watching five-minute bar charts will observe the same
patterns that an analyst watching monthly bar charts will see. These patterns suggest that the
behavior that produces them is dependent also on the participants’ period of interest. A pattern in
a five-minute bar chart, for example, is the result of other traders with a five-minute bar chart
time horizon. Monthly investors would have very little effect on the five-minute bar chart, as
five-minute traders would have almost no effect on the monthly bar chart. Thus, each group of
participants, as defined by their investment horizon, has its own world of patterns that might or
might not affect each other but will be similar in shape. Pattern analysis is, therefore, universal
and independent of time.

Notice that the patterns are almost identical, yet they occur over different time intervals, one with
daily bars and the other with hourly bars. The development of the pattern, the shape of the pattern, ptg
and the final breakdown are very similar. These patterns are said to be “fractal” in that they occur
irrespective of time.
FIGURE 2.4 Daily and hourly charts in the same stock over different periods
Sixth, technical analysis is also based on the notion that emotions are affected by earlier
emotions through emotional feedback. If I buy a stock today and its price rises, I am happy and
tell others to buy the stock, or others see its price rising and also buy it, thus causing the price to
rise farther. Action in the markets, therefore, is not independent but is related instead to how the
market itself is behaving. Excessive feedback can cause “bubbles” when price behavior rises far
out of proportion to value and can cause panics when price behavior declines sharply. Technical
analysis presumes that prices will expand beyond equilibrium for emotional reasons and eventu-
ally will revert to the mean and then expand beyond the mean in the opposite direction, con-
stantly oscillating back and forth with excessive investor sentiment.

more detail. Some of the basic beliefs that technical analysis is built on and that we build upon
throughout this book are as follows:
• The interaction of supply and demand determine price.
• Supply and demand are affected by investors’ emotions and biases particularly fear
and greed.
• Price discounts everything.
• Prices trend.
• Recognizable patterns form within trends.
• Patterns are fractal.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
ptg
1. Explain why the notion that prices trend is central to the practice of technical analysis.
2. The earlier an uptrend can be spotted, the more money an investor can make by “riding the
trend.” Explain why recognizing a trend too late reduces potential profits for the investor.
3. The sooner an investor recognizes that a trend has changed, the more profitable the
investor’s trading will be. Explain why early recognition of trend reversals influences the
investor’s profitability.
4. Newton’s first law of motion is inertia—an object in motion will remain in motion in the
same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. How does this physics principle
serve as an analogy for the notion of trends in technical analysis?
5. Define primary, secondary, short-term, and intraday trends.
6. Gather monthly closing prices for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from 1965
until the present. One publicly available source for this data can be found electronically at

EARLY FINANCIAL MARKETS AND EXCHANGES
Though technical analysis is thought to be an ancient method of analyzing markets and prices, its
history has been poorly recorded. We do not have recorded evidence of technical analysis being
used in ancient times, but it is conceivable that technical analysis, in some form, was used in the
distant past in freely traded markets.
Markets in one form or another have existed for centuries. For instance, we know that
notes and checks between traders and bankers existed in Babylon by 2000 BC (Braudel, 1981).
Currency exchange, commodities, and participations in mercantile voyages were traded in Ostia,
the seaport of Rome, in the second century AD (Braudel, 1982). In the Middle Ages, wheat,
bean, oat, and barley prices were available from 1160 on in Angevin, England (Farmer, 1956);
and a large grain market existed in Toulouse as early as 1203 (Braudel, 1982). Publicly available
evidence suggests that as early as the twelfth century, markets existed in most towns and cities
and were linked in a network of arbitrage (Braudel, 1982).

24 Part 1 Introduction
Exchanges were developed later where more complicated negotiable instruments, such as
state loan stocks, were invented, accepted, and traded. The earliest exchanges appeared in the
fourteenth century, mostly in the Mediterranean cities of Pisa, Venice, Florence, Genoa, Valen-
cia, and Barcelona. In fact, the Lonja, the first building constructed as an exchange, was built in
1393 in Barcelona (Carriere, 1973). The Lonja has been described as
…a whole squadron of brokers [could be seen] moving in and out of its pillars, and
the people standing in little groups were corridors d’orella, the “brokers by ear”
whose job was to listen, report, and put interested parties in touch. (Carriere, 1973)
The statutes of Verona confirm the existence of the settlement or forward market (mercato
a termine), and a jurist named Bartolomo de Bosco is recorded as protesting against a sale of for-
ward loca in Genoa in 1428 (Braudel, 1981). As early as the fifteenth century, Kuxen shares in
German mines were quoted at the Liepzig fairs (Maschke) and stocks traded in Hanseatic towns
(Sprandel, 1971). A trading market for municipal stocks known as renes sur L’Hotel existed in
France as early as 1522 (Schnapper, 1957).
Can we assume that traders would record prices in these sophisticated markets and would
attempt to derive ways to profit from those recordings? It seems very likely. Even if prices were ptg
not recorded using pencil and paper, traders mentally remembering past prices and using these
memories to predict future price movements would be using a form of technical analysis.
By 1585, public quotes of over 339 items were reported as traded on the streets and in the
coffee houses in Amsterdam (Boxer, 1965). Commodities had been traded there as early as 1530
(Stringham, 2003). The greatest of the early exchanges, the Amsterdam Exchange, called “The
Beurs” or “Bourse,” was founded in 1608. The building housing the exchange was built in 1611
and was modeled after the Antwerp Bourse of 1531 (Munro, 2005). This exchange is famous for
the “Tulip Bulb Mania” of 1621. By 1722, the Amsterdam Exchange provided trading space for
over 4,500 traders every day between noon and two o’clock (Ricard, 1722). Dealers, brokers, and
the public traded and speculated on short sales, forwards, commodities, currencies, shares of
ventures, and maritime insurance, as well as other financial instruments, such as notes, bonds,
loans, and stocks. They traded grain, herring, spices, whale oil, and, of course, tulips (Kellen-
benz, 1957, 1996). The principal stock traded was in the Dutch East India Company. (See Figure
3.1, which is an example of one of the oldest stock shares.) It seems likely that prices for these
items were also recorded and analyzed.
In the eighteenth century, as the Dutch empire declined, the London and Paris Exchanges
gradually surpassed the Amsterdam Exchange in activity and offerings. In other parts of the
world, specifically in Japan, cash-only commodity markets in rice and silver were developing,
usually at the docks of major seacoast cities. It is in these markets we first read about a wealthy
trader who used technical analysis and trading discipline to amass a fortune.
His name was Sokyo Honma. Born in 1716 as Kosaku Kato in Sakata, Yamagata Prefec-
ture, during the Tokugawa period, he was adopted by the Honma family and took their name. A
coastal city, Sakata was a distribution center for rice. Honma became very wealthy by trading
rice and was known throughout Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. He was promoted to Samurai (not bad
for a technical trader) and died in Tokyo at the age of 87.

Honma’s rules are recorded as the “Sakata constitution.” These rules include methods of
analyzing one day’s price record to predict the next day’s price, three days of rice prices to pre-
dict the fourth day’s price, and rate of change analysis (Shimizu, 1986). None of this information
was recorded on charts—they came later in Japan. Honma’s rules might also be considered
“trading rules” rather than “technical rules” because they had much to do with how to limit loss
and when to step away from markets. Nevertheless, his methods were based on prices and, thus,
largely technical, were successful, and, most important, were recorded.
Because Japan is the first place in which recorded technical rules have been found, many
historians have suggested that technical analysis began in the rice markets in Japan. However, it
seems inconceivable that technical analysis was not used in the more sophisticated and earlier
markets and exchanges in Medieval Europe. Indeed, even in Japan, it is thought that charts were
introduced first in the silver market around 1870 by an “English man” (Shimizu, 1986). Thus,
technical analysis has a poorly recorded history but by inference is a very old method of analyz-
ing trading markets and prices.

26 Part I Introduction
MODERN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Although the practice of technical analysis in some forms likely dates back many centuries,
Charles Dow (1851–1902) was the first to reintroduce and comment on it in recent times. He is
considered the father of “modern” technical analysis. Dow’s introduction of stock indexes to
measure the performance of the stock market allowed for a major advance in the sophistication
of stock market participants.
Dow was a lifelong newspaper journalist. His specialization in covering financial news
began with a mining story he wrote when working for the Providence Journal (Rhode Island) in
1879. In 1880, Dow relocated to New York, where he continued covering the mining industry. In
1882, Dow joined with Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser to form Dow, Jones & Company.
The company offices were located behind a soda shop that was located next door to the entrance
of the New York Stock Exchange. The company wrote handwritten news bulletins and distributed
them by messenger to customers in the Wall Street vicinity.
On July 3, 1884, Dow published his first version of a stock index in the company’s “Cus-
tomer’s Afternoon Newsletter.” Dow calculated this price-weighted average simply by summing
the prices of the stocks in the index and dividing by the number of stocks. This index included a
ptg
total of 11 stocks—9 railroads and 2 industrials.
Table 3.1 shows the companies that Dow included in this first index. Although this might
seem to be an odd combination by today’s standards, the index was consistent with the important
role the railway companies played in the economy of the 1880s. In February 1885, Dow began
publishing a daily index of actively traded, highly capitalized stocks. This index contained 12
railways and 2 industrial stocks. By January 1886, Dow replaced the 14-stock index with a 12-
stock index, containing 10 railroads and 2 industrials. By May 1896, Dow recognized the
increasing role the emerging industrial sector was playing in the U.S. economy and altered his
index so that it consisted entirely of indus-
TABLE 3.1 “Customer’s Afternoon Newsletter” trial stocks. The first version of the Dow
(Forerunner to the Wall Street Journal) Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) appeared in
the Wall Street Journal on May 26, 1896, and
July 3, 1884 included the 12 stocks listed in Table 3.2.

Dow’s original intent was to use these

averages as predictors of the economy, but
his analysis took a life of its own, and his the- ptg
ories became known as the “Dow Theory.”
(See Chapter 6, “Dow Theory.”) They are the foundation for modern technical analysis. The prin-
ciples that Dow established are still valid today, albeit in a different form.
However, Dow’s contribution to the field of technical analysis goes beyond the creation of
indexes. The Dow Jones Company was the first in the United States to publicly report stock
prices. Private subscription letters with stock prices had existed earlier but were available only to
the few who paid directly for them. The reporting of prices on a consistent basis provided the
“meat” for technical analysis. Motivation came from the many wide swings in prices both from
legitimate news and information as well as from manipulation. By watching prices, investors and
traders hoped to gather information on who was buying and selling shares and, thus, what the
prospects for future prices might be. Technical analysis is a means for the uninformed to become
informed.
With recording of prices and the calculation of averages, analysts began to see that prices
often traded with certain repetitive patterns. They also noticed that market dynamics are compli-
cated and influenced by people and their own way of looking at investments, their own time hori-
zons, their own information, and their own emotions. Patterns in market averages, specifically
the “line” and the “double” top or bottom, were first mentioned by Charles Dow and his subse-
quent followers, William Peter Hamilton, S. A. Nelson, and Robert Rhea, in the 1920s. Richard
D. Wyckoff offered a successful correspondence course in trading and investing, principally
using technical analysis theories, in 1931. Earlier, in the 1920s, he published a technical newslet-
ter that reached over 200,000 subscribers.
Also in the 1920s and 1930s, classic indicators such as the advance-decline line (A/D line)
were created. Colonel Leonard P. Ayers (1944) developed an early measure of business confi-
dence and is considered the originator of the A/D line. Ayers ran a company called Standard Sta-
tistics. In 1941, Standard Statistics merged with a company headed by Henry Poor; this new
entity became Standard and Poor’s.

28 Part I Introduction
Richard W. Schabacker, the financial editor of Forbes magazine and of the New York Times,
began to recognize individual stock patterns and observed many common characteristics
between different issues. He is probably the first person to use the words “triangle,” “pennant,”
and “head-and-shoulders” to describe chart formations we consider in future chapters. Sch-
abacker authored Stock Market Theory and Practice (1930), Technical Analysis and Market
Profits (1932), and Stock Market Profits (1934). The commodity markets, which had long
depended on price action for their speculative activity, also evolved their share of special techni-
cal theories such as those by William Delbert Gann. This was the age of speculation, inside infor-
mation, and manipulation with little regulation. Those outside the information loop were at a
disadvantage. Technical analysis made the difference by using price action as a predictive tool.
During the late 1930s and much of the 1940s, little was written about stock market analy-
sis. If we consider the business and economic climate at that time, it is not surprising that there is
a void in the literature. After the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Graham and Dodd published one of the few pieces of security analysis of the period. In their
book, Security Analysis (1934), Graham and Dodd established the fundamental analysis side of
investment analysis, which is concerned with economic conditions and company value. Although
this book provides the groundwork for the development of fundamental analysis, a closer reading
of it reveals that Graham and Dodd did not believe that fundamental analysis alone determined ptg
stock prices. For example, consider the following passage from their book:
The influence of what we call analytical factors over the market price is both partial
and indirect—partial, because it frequently competes with purely speculative factors
which influence the price in the opposite direction; and indirect, because it acts
through the intermediary of people’s sentiments and decisions. In other words, the
market is not a weighing machine, on which the value of each issue is recorded by an
exact and impersonal mechanism, in accordance with its specific qualities. Rather
we should say that the market is a voting machine, whereon countless individuals
register choices which are the product of and partly of emotion. (p. 28)
It was not until 1948 that Robert Edwards (son-in-law to Schabacker) and John Magee (see
Figure 3.2) published the first edition of Technical Analysis of Stock Trends. Edwards and Magee
demonstrated the technical patterns observed in hundreds of stocks. Their interpretations are still
used to this day, and technicians know their book as the “bible of technical analysis.” In fact, the
ninth edition of the book was published in 2009.
At first, prices were recorded and then plotted by hand. Indeed, even today, strict followers
of point-and-figure technique plot their charts by hand, as do many specialists and traders who
want to get the “feel” of the stocks they are trading. Chart services published books of hand-plot-
ted charts for those who could not afford the time to check for accuracy and plot their own charts.
As technical analysts became increasingly comfortable with more complex mathematical
tools, they focused on more than just the chart patterns of their predecessors. Analysts began
using more advanced mathematics to describe price action. The most prominent technical ana-
lyst of the 1950s was Joseph Granville, who worked for E. F. Hutton and published a short arti-
cle on the Barron’s Confidence Index in Barron’s in 1959. After this article, Granville wrote two
books in which he covered on-balance volume, the 200-day moving average, and other tools and

In the 1960s, the concept of rate of change (ROC), or momentum, became one of the tech-
nician’s tools. By the late 1970s, computer technology was available to draw charts more accu-
rately and with greater speed. In addition, ratios, oscillators, and other more arcane calculations
could be moved from the adding machine to the computer for quicker calculation and more thor-
ough testing. The computer changed the face of technical analysis forever.
One of the most popular technical tools developed in the 1970s was the relative strength
index (RSI), created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. (see Figure 3.3). One of the most inventive techni-
cians, Wilder is also credited with the Directional Movement concept, the Parabolic System, and
Average True Range, all still used today. Another technician and commodity trader, Richard
Donchian, promoted the use of the 10-day and 20-day moving averages crossovers as buy and
sell signals, as well as the “4-week” rule, whereby a price break above or below the four-week
high or low indicated the initial stage of a new trend. Focusing on the options market, technician
Martin Zweig examined the use of the put-call ratio. A variety of moving average indicators was
developed, such as moving-average envelopes, moving-average crossover, and the Moving-
Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) oscillator, by technicians like Fred Hitschler and
Gerald Appel. We mention many other inventive technical analysts in later chapters when we
cover their specialties.
Just as the mathematical sophistication and computer technology was allowing for great
advances in the development of technical analysis, technical analysis came under fire by the aca-
demic community. Academics argued that technical analysis was impossible because prices were

30 Part I Introduction
randomly distributed and had no history embedded in them that could predict future prices. At
the same time, proponents of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis argued that markets were efficient
and that news, information, and so on was immediately and rationally discounted in the markets.
Because no means of price study could anticipate such news, technical analysis was a futile
study. Gradually, professional money managers, most of whom were raised and trained at busi-
ness schools in this antitechnical school of thinking, closed their technical departments, and
technical analysis went into a decline.
However, while the academic community was discount-
ing the use of technical analysis, the technical analyst’s access
to more powerful computers and better data was rapidly
increasing. The fast computers and accessibility to a large data
set of clean post-World War II data allowed analysts to attempt
to optimize their trading strategies, taking past price data and
performing numerous calculations to determine which of a
number of strategies would have yielded the best profits. These
optimized results could be used to develop future trading

Ironically, although the dawning of the computer age
brought new, increasingly sophisticated technical tools to the
study of technical analysis, the development of these tools coincided with the introduction of an
ancient technical tool to the U.S. financial markets. As we discussed earlier, Japanese candlestick
charts dated back to the mid-1700s; however, the western financial markets had not had access to
the Japanese writings and technical tools. Steve Nison introduced candlestick charts into U.S.
technical analysis in the late 1980s. Since then, numerous other chart types like Kagi, Kase,
Renko, and Ichimoku Kinko have been added to the list of visual analysis methods.
CURRENT ADVANCES IN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Interest in technical analysis is resurging. The Efficient Markets Hypothesis has been found to
have a number of serious flaws, and stock price motion is being shown to be nonrandom. This
new knowledge has cast doubt on the objections raised earlier about technical analysis, and aca-
demics are gradually beginning to perform serious studies on technical theory and indicators.
Behavioral Finance, a relatively new realm of study concerned with the psychology of market
participants, has shown that investors do not necessarily act rationally, as is assumed in the Effi-
cient Markets Hypothesis. They have found instances of predictable investor behavior and are
beginning to explain some of the reasons for price patterns known by technical analysts over a
hundred years.
During the equity market decline from 2000 to 2002 and from 2007 to 2009, many stocks
declined severely before the damaging information causing their decline became public. In the
earlier period, the names of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, HealthSouth, Qwest, and others ring in the

ears of those who suffered large losses by owning these stocks and by being fooled and lied to by
their managements. Although this might not have been manipulation in the old style, it neverthe-
less again was the uninformed being duped by the informed. In the later period, the seriousness
of the mortgage-debt implosion was kept from the public to prevent panic, yet the stocks affected
by the crisis took terrible beatings. For example, Citigroup, a Dow Jones Industrial Average
stock, declined from $57 to less than $1, and AIG, an institutional favorite, declined from over
$1,400 to $8 during the same period.
Figure 3.4 shows a monthly stock chart for Tyco. Technical analysis, if properly applied,
would have protected an investor from large losses in this stock because it would have warned
that the price action of these stocks was not consistent with what management was saying to the
fundamental analysts. On January 9, 2002, a Prudential Securities analyst was the first large Wall
Street analyst to downgrade the stock from a buy to a hold (New York Times). Figure 3.4 shows
the price of Tyco falling while fundamental analysts were still recommending that investors buy
the stock and while insiders of the company, such as the CFO, were claiming, “The more you
know about our accounting, the more comfortable you will be” (Wall Street Journal, February
14, 2002).
In addition, falling commissions and maximum speed of communication have made tech-
nical analysis extremely useful to those who can spend the time studying it. Analysts developed ptg
trading rules that trade portfolios without human intervention. Futures markets in stock averages,
currencies, and other markets have expanded and become more efficient, making competition
extremely keen. Stock market trades have become almost instantaneous, and with the advent of
computerized markets, intermediaries, with their delay and cost, have largely been eliminated.
Computers are now so sophisticated that almost every possible technical calculation has
been tried and tested. Market participants know, as they have long suspected, that no magic for-
mula for riches exists. The reason is that people trading and investing in an imperfect, emotion-
ally charged world determine prices. Because technical analysis deals only with price and some
other incidental trading information, it has evolved into a study of more intangible information,
concerned mostly with psychology and trading behavior. Modern computer technology has
demonstrated that prices are not necessarily random, but also that they are not perfectly pre-
dictable. The reason, of course, is that people buy and sell items based not only on what they
believe are reasonable expectations but also on emotion, specifically fear and greed, inherent and
learned bias, overconfidence, perception, and prejudice. Emotion has always been a large com-
ponent in technical analysis studies.
Today, technical analysis covers many different time horizons: long-term investing, short-
term swing, and intraday trading. The indicators and methods utilized for these horizons often
have their own characteristics. In addition to time horizons, different investing or trading instru-
ments exist. Commodities, for example, have their own technical information and peculiarities,
as do currencies and financial instruments such as bonds and notes. The subject of technical
analysis is complex. Because knowledge of all possibilities is impossible, the individual must
decide the period, methods, and instruments best suited to his or her personality, ability, knowl-
edge, and time available. Although the basic principles of technical analysis that we investigate
in this book are common to all areas of markets, investors must learn by reading, studying, and
experiencing the peculiarities of the markets in which they want to profit.

• The basic principles of the Random Walk Hypothesis (RWH) ptg
• The historical distribution of stock market returns
• The basic principles of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)
• The pragmatic criticisms of technical analysis
• How technical analysts respond to critics
Though technical analysis is widely used by practitioners, its popularity is not mirrored in the
academic community. The divergence in emphasis placed on technical analysis is highlighted by
a study conducted by Flanegin and Rudd (2005) in which they surveyed both college professors
and practitioners. The college professors were asked how much emphasis they placed on each of
20 topics in their investment courses. These professors ranked the subject areas on a 1 to 5 scale,
with “1” indicating that they spent very little time in class on the material and “5” indicating that
they spent considerable time on the topic. Given the same list of 20 topics, the practitioners were
asked which subject matter they utilized within the realm of their jobs on a fairly consistent
basis. These professionals also ranked the topics on a 1 to 5 scale, with “1” signifying the topic
was not used and “5” indicating that the subject was used all the time. Table 4.1 provides a sum-
mary of their results. The practitioners report seldom using many of the topics most thoroughly
covered by the professors. Likewise, the professors in the study report very little class time is
spent teaching the subject material practitioners claim to use most often.

This divergence is not surprising given the fact that the majority of academics opposes the use of
technical analysis. In fact, a study by Robert Strong (1988) showed that over 60% of PhDs do not
believe that technical analysis can be used as an effective tool to enhance investment perform-
ance. Because of the view of these academics, little emphasis has been placed on technical analy-
sis in traditional finance curriculums in recent years, as shown in the Flanegin and Rudd survey
results.
Because the academic community strongly resists the use of technical analysis, we address
in this chapter some of the academic community’s criticisms before moving on to the specific
techniques and tools of technical analysis. The principal theoretical arguments against technical
analysis are the Random Walk Hypothesis (RWH) and the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH).
Each hypothesis makes broad assumptions that in their purest state would eliminate the possibil-
ity for technical analysis, or fundamental analysis for that matter. Let us look at each of these
hypotheses a little more closely.

Chapter 4 The Technical Analysis Controversy 35
DO MARKETS FOLLOW A RANDOM WALK?
Opponents of technical analysis claim that looking at past technical data, such as price and vol-
ume, to help predict the future is outlandish. In the popular book, A Random Walk Down Wall
Street, Burton Malkiel refers to technical analysis as “sharing a pedestal with alchemy.” Some of
these opponents believe that no underlying patterns exist in stock prices. These individuals
believe that prices move in a random fashion and have no “memory.” This assumption would
imply that technical analysis, which depends on prices predicting prices, has no foundation
because all price motion is random.
A random walk occurs when future steps cannot be predicted by observing past steps. For
example, flipping a coin produces a random walk. Suppose you flip a coin once and it lands on
heads; observing that the coin landed on heads does not help you predict what the outcome will
be the next time the coin is flipped. Each flip of the coin is an independent event, and the out-
come of one flip of the coin has no impact on the outcome of any other flip. If the stock market
follows a random walk, future stock prices cannot be predicted by observing past stock price
movements.
The concept that stock price returns followed a random walk was first suggested by Louis
Bachelier (see Box 4.1), a French mathematician, in his PhD thesis, “The Theory of Speculation”
ptg
(1900, 1906, and 1913). He commented that “the mathematical expectation of the speculator is
zero.” In the 1937 Econometrica article, “Some A Posteriori Probabilities in Stock Market
Action,” Alfred Cowles and Herbert E. Jones (1937) also hypothesized that the stock market
prices exhibited randomness. It was Paul Cootner’s 1964 book, The Random Character of Stock
Market Prices, that popularized the random walk theory and its application in the stock market.
The following year, Eugene Fama’s seminal article (1965), “The Behavior of Stock Market
Prices,” was published in the Journal of Business, giving additional credence to the random walk
theory.
BOX 4.1 LOUIS BACHELIER
Louis Bachelier (1870–1946) was the first person to anticipate Brownian motion,
random walk of financial prices, option pricing, and martingales long before Ein-
stein, Wiener, and Black and Scholes. Receiving high marks from his advisor, the
famous mathematician, Henri Poincare, Bachelier became a lecturer at the Sorbonne
and at several other universities. In 1926, he was turned down for a professorship at
Dijon because of a critical letter from another famous mathematician, Paul Levy,
who was unfamiliar with his earlier work. Later, in 1931, Levy learned of his work
and sent an apology. Bachelier ended up as a professor in Besançon. Einstein had
never heard of his work, and, finally, in the 1960s, when Professor Paul Samuelson
distributed Bachelier’s work among leading economists, his financial theories were
“rediscovered.”

36 Part I Introduction
Fat Tails
A normal distribution curve looks like the bell-shaped chart in Figure 4.1.
ptg
FIGURE 4.1 Normal bell-shaped curve
Figure 4.2 shows a chart of the actual distribution of stock returns for General Electric
between January 1, 2003, and November 19, 2004. Compare Figure 4.1 with Figure 4.2. Notice
how the chart of real historical returns (Figure 4.2) does not perfectly match the bell-shaped
curve shown in Figure 4.1. In particular, compare the outer edges, or tails, of the two charts. The
tails of the normal distribution, in Figure 4.1, get thinner and thinner, approaching zero. How-
ever, in the actual stock return data in Figure 4.2, we do not see this thinning of the tails; instead,
we see that the tails have bumps or remain flat. Thus “fat tails” are present in Figure 4.2 but not
in Figure 4.1.
Benoit Mandelbrot (1963) first noticed this phenomenon of fat tails, called a “leptokurtic
distribution,” in stock market returns in the early 1960s. Fat tails occur when one or more events
cause stock prices to deviate extraordinarily from the mean.
An example of one of these events is the large decline in stock prices that occurred on
October 19, 1987. On this day, known as “Black Monday,” the U.S. stock market crashed, send-
ing the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 22.6%. What are the chances of a one-day drop of
this magnitude occurring randomly? In a 1996 article appearing in the Journal of Finance, Jens
Carsten Jackwerth and Mark Rubenstein state that if the life of the universe had been repeated
one billion times and the stock market were open every day, a crash of that magnitude would still
have been “unlikely.” In his 2003 book, Why Stock Markets Crash: Critical Events in Complex
Financial Systems, Didier Sornette claims that, statistically, a crash as large as was seen on Black
Monday would be expected to occur only once in 520 million years. Thus, the huge negative
return seen in October of 1987 is clearly an outlier.

Drawdowns
Black Monday represented an abnormally large one-day negative return in the stock market.
Although this alone was a significant deviation from the mean stock return, even more signifi-
cant is the fact that October 19 was preceded by three days of market losses. Market losses were
2%, 3%, and 6% on the three previous trading days. In other words, there were four consecutive
days of trading losses, resulting in a 30% decline in the market. Periods of successive losses like
this are referred to as drawdowns.
Sornette has studied these types of drawdowns in an attempt to understand why outliers
occur and how they can be integrated into the RWH. He argues that although independence can
accommodate one large deviation, the probability of two or more large deviations occurring
back-to-back is out in the stratosphere.
For example, the probability of a one-day decline of 10% in the stock market is approxi-
mately 1 in 1,000. In other words, a 10% drop would occur statistically once every four years.
Although a drop of this magnitude would be a large deviation from the average daily stock
return, it would fall within the normal distribution. If stock returns are independent, the probabil-
ity of two consecutive daily drops of 10% would be the product of the probability of the two
independent events occurring, or 1/1000 multiplied by 1/1000. Likewise, the probability of three
consecutive 10% drops, or a 30% drawdown, is 1/1000 ×1/1000 ×1/1000, or 1 in 1,000,000,000.
This means, statistically, a 30% three-day drawdown could be expected to occur only once every
four million years!
Historically, of course, these back-to-back events have occurred, especially in declines.
Dismissing randomness under such events suggests that when sequential returns reach a critical

mass, they begin to foretell future returns and are, thus, no longer random or independent. Sor-
nette calls these periods “bursts of dependence” or “pockets of predictability.” If these successive
declines occur more often than what is statistically predicted, some correlation must exist
between the daily stock returns, indicating that stock returns do not follow a random walk.

*Adapted from Didier Sornette, 2003
As shown in Table 4.2, Sornette’s research indicates that large drawdowns in the DJIA
have occurred more often than can be statistically expected. When considering the three largest
twentieth-century stock market declines (1914, 1929, and 1987), Sornette calculates that statisti-
cally about 50 centuries should separate crashes of these magnitudes. He concludes that three
declines of this magnitude occurring within three-quarters of a century of each other are an indi-
cation that the series of returns was not completely random.
What Sornette found was that under normal circumstances, returns follow a generally nor-
mal distribution. These normal conditions represent about 99% of market drawdowns. However,
there appears to be a completely different dynamic occurring in the remaining 1% of drawdowns;
these drawdowns occur in the fat tails of the distribution when extraordinary market declines
occur (see Figure 4.3). Interestingly, Sornette also found this drawdown, outlier behavior com-
mon to currency, gold, foreign stock markets, and the stocks of major corporations, even though
individual-day declines were contained within the normal distribution.

Drawdown
In this chart, Sornette compares the number of times particular drawdowns and drawups occurred in
the DJIA during the twentieth century. Compare the actual numbers with those assumed by the null
hypothesis of randomness shown by the straight lines.
FIGURE 4.3 Frequency of drawdowns and drawups in the DJIA
Proportions of Scale
A random walk is associated with a specific scaling property. Under RWH, if price change fluc-
tuates over one series of intervals, say days, price change fluctuations over another series of
intervals, say weeks, should be randomly distributed and proportional to the square root of the
original interval changes. In other words, the square root of the typical amplitude of return fluc-
tuations increases in proportion to time. If this proportional relationship does not exist, the price
changes are not completely random. Furthermore, if the plot of the distribution of price changes
shows any irregularity from the ideal plot of a random sequence of numbers, the assumption of
randomness is challenged.
Andrew W. Lo of MIT (see Figure 4.4) and A. Craig MacKinlay of the Wharton School of
Business tested to see if this proportional relationship does indeed exist. In their 1988 Review of
Financial Studies article, “Stock Market Prices Do Not Follow Random Walks: Evidence from a
Simple Specification Test,” they reported that these amplitudes were not proportional for the
time period from September 1962 to December 1985 and concluded that stock returns were non-
random.
Lo and MacKinlay used a simple mathematical model to demonstrate the nonrandomness
of stock prices. Surprised that such a simple proof had not been used earlier, they conducted a

more thorough research of the literature. In doing so, they found that others (Larson, 1960;
Alexander, 1961; Osborne, 1962; Cootner, 1962; Steiger, 1964; Niederhoffer and Osborne,
1966; and Schwartz and Whitcomb, 1977) had also demonstrated the absence of random walk in
securities prices. With the exception of the Schwartz and Whitcomb article, these previous stud-
ies had been published outside of the mainstream academic finance journals and had been
ignored by finance academics. Even today, many professionals, not having read the literature or
heard the results from their peers, incorrectly believe that security prices follow a random walk.
The random walk model is strongly rejected for the entire sample period (1962–1985)
and for all subperiods for a variety of aggregate returns indexes and size-sorted port-
folios. Although the rejections are due largely to the behavior of small stocks, they
cannot be attributed completely to the effects of infrequent trading or time-varying
volatilities. Moreover, the rejection of the random walk for weekly returns does not
support a mean-reverting model of asset prices. (Lo and MacKinlay, 1988)
In sum, evidence against the RWH has been
found in many tests of independence, distribution, and
proportion. The occurrence of strange outliers implies
that other dynamics are occurring in freely traded ptg
markets. The evidence against the possibility of a ran-
dom walk in price returns, however, does not suggest
that technical analysis is an assured strategy. Yes, cer-
tain technical strategies may work, but the rejection of
the RWH only suggests that because price returns are
not purely randomly distributed, they may be depend-
ent; in other words, they may have a “memory” and
may provide some form of predictive power. The
importance of the elimination of the RWH to technical
analysis is that the profitability of technical analysis
cannot be automatically dismissed as improbable. If
price returns are somewhat dependent, as the tests
Courtesy of Professor Andrew W. Lo, MIT show, then the gates are open for technical analysis to
predict future prices.

CAN PAST PATTERNS BE USED TO PREDICT THE FUTURE?
Some researchers who have accepted that stock prices do not follow a random walk still do not
accept the validity of technical analysts. These opponents agree that there may be patterns that
can be fitted to stock price movement after the fact, but they argue that these past patterns cannot
be used to predict the future. In other words, past patterns cannot be exploited to gain above-
average returns. There are two major reasons why this group of opponents, especially academics,
has drawn these conclusions.
First, though there may be some underlying patterns, markets are constantly being affected
by new information. This new information causes enough variability in the underlying pattern
that any knowledge of the underlying pattern will not be enough to exploit the knowledge for

profit. For example, a recurring business cycle is a well-known and accepted economic phenom-
enon but not a predictable harmonic. The economy experiences expansionary periods followed
by recessionary periods repeatedly. Therefore, we can expect cycles of expansions and contrac-
tions in the future. However, each of these business cycles is unique; the cycles vary in length
and intensity. Thus, acknowledgment of a recurring cycle cannot be equated with the ability to
predict the timing of an expansion or the intensity of a recession.
Second, even if we can use past stock market statistics, such as price and volume, to help
predict future stock market movements, this information will not allow us to earn abnormal,
above-average profits in the stock market. This conclusion is a result of the assumption of mar-
ket efficiency. The EMH is widely accepted in the economic and finance communities, espe-
cially among academics. The EMH argues that price changes occur only on new information,
immediately and rationally applied, and that any irregular price action is quickly adjusted back to
true value by arbitration. Because prices change only on new information, technical analysis can-
not determine future prices without that new information and is, thus, futile.
WHAT ABOUT MARKET EFFICIENCY?
Because of the central role the EMH has played in financial theory in the past 35 years, we spend a
ptg
little time developing the basic ideas of the EMH and how, although it might be an interesting and
thought-provoking model, it does not necessarily describe the real world of investments and markets.
Market efficiency is a description of how prices in competitive markets respond to
new information. The arrival of new information to a competitive market can be
likened to the arrival of a lamb chop to a school of flesh-eating piranha, where
investors are—plausibly enough—the piranha. The instant the lamb chop hits the
water, there is a turmoil as the fish devour the meat. Very soon the meat is gone, leav-
ing only the worthless bone behind, and the water returns to normal. Similarly, when
new information reaches a competitive market, there is much turmoil as investors
buy and sell securities in response to the news, causing prices to change. Once prices
adjust, all that is left of the information is the worthless bone. No amount of gnawing
on the bone will yield any more meat, and no further study of old information will
yield any more valuable intelligence. (Higgins, 1992)
The EMH, which evolved in the 1960s from Eugene Fama’s PhD dissertation, states that at
any given time, security prices fully reflect all available information. The implication of this hypoth-
esis is that if current prices fully reflect all information, the market price of a security will be a good
estimate of its intrinsic value, and no investment strategy can be used to outperform the market.
The basis for the EMH is the economic theory of competitive markets. Basic economic
theory teaches that arbitrage competition among investors and their profit motive will create effi-
cient markets. As new information enters the marketplace, so the hypothesis states, all investors
will be appraised of it immediately and will act rationally to adjust the price to the new intrinsic
value of the security. Should the price deviate from its true value, so-called “noise,” arbitrageurs
will compete to bring that price back to that value at which the price will be in equilibrium with
its value. Such is a purely efficient market. Figure 4.5 shows what would happen in a purely effi-
cient market to a security price upon the announcement of new information. It shows a steplike
progression as the price reacts instantly to that new information.

This figure shows the ideal efficient market assumption of how information affects price and two
other assumptions that have been shown to be more realistic.
FIGURE 4.5 The impact that new information has on security prices
Unfortunately for the hypothesis and fortunately for technical analysis, empirical evidence
demonstrates that these immediate and complete reactions to new information do not occur. The
problems with the hypothesis center around the assumptions that all investors will receive new
information instantly, will react rationally to that new information, and that arbitrageurs will
immediately and always act to adjust any deviations in the price back to its new value. Indeed, in
their 1980 article “On the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets,” Stanford ptg
Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz argue that because information is costly for investors to obtain,
prices cannot perfectly reflect all available information. If prices do perfectly reflect all available
information, those who obtain costly information receive no compensation for doing so.
Even Paul Samuelson, professor at MIT and originator of the EMH, has begun to slightly
change his tune.
Samuelson’s Dictum:
Modern markets show considerable micro efficiency (for the reason that the
minority who spot aberrations from micro efficiency can make money from those
occurrences and, in doing so, they tend to wipe out any persistent inefficiencies).
In no contradiction to the previous sentence, I had hypothesized considerable
macro inefficiency, in the sense of long waves in the time series of aggregate
indexes of security prices below and above various definitions of fundamental
values. (Paul A. Samuelson in a private letter to John Campbell and Robert
Shiller, from Robert J. Shiller, Irrational Exuberance, 2nd Edition, 2001, p 243)
New Information
Information for purposes of the EMH is any news that will affect the intrinsic value of the secu-
rity. In the case of a stock, most analysts and theoreticians hypothesize that the value of a com-
pany’s stock is equal to the present value of the future cash flows that the investor purchasing the
stock expects to receive. This present value is a function of all of the company’s future cash
flows and the expected interest rate during the period that the cash flows occur. New information
is any news that affects interest rates or cash flow directly or indirectly. That information can be
related to the underlying company or can be any of a multitude of other news about the economy,
politics, and so on. In short, it can be almost anything because almost all change has an effect on
value regardless of its immediate importance.

Chapter 4 The Technical Analysis Controversy 43
Information itself is subject to many problems and thus brings into question the precepts
about it in the EMH. A well-documented characteristic of financial markets is the presence of
asymmetric information. Asymmetric information refers to a situation in which one party of a
transaction has information that the other party involved in the transaction does not have. For
example, the managers of a corporation have better information about how well their business is
doing than the stockholders do. In addition, the company managers know whether they are being
honest about their reporting of the company’s financial position, but stockholders cannot imme-
diately discern whether the managers are being honest.
As any investor knows, in the real world, all information is not disseminated instantly to all
market players. A classic example of the presence of asymmetric information is the Enron deba-
cle in 2000. The management of Enron knew for years that the fundamental numbers being
reported to the public and to analysts were incorrect and were upwardly exaggerated to maintain
an artificially high stock price for acquisitions (see Figure 4.6). The true information was kept
inside the corporation and known by only a few insiders.
Even when the real story began to leak out and the stock price began to decline, security
analysts on Wall Street continued to recommend the stock based on projections from the old,
incorrect numbers. Thus, this new information was dribbled out to the public in small amounts.
But, even when finally disseminated among analysts, it was not interpreted correctly. This is an
extreme case, of course, but in the practical world of investments, new information gets dissem- ptg
inated slowly through the investment world and is acted upon with even more hesitation.
Therefore, several problems exist in the process of information dissemination. First, in its
transmission, the information might be inaccurate. Second, the source might be intentionally
lying, as in the case of Enron executives. Third, the information might not be disseminated
immediately even though it is time sensitive. Fourth, there exists a natural lag between when the
news is announced and when it is received by the last recipient, during which time the informa-
tion might have changed.
Once information disseminates, the market participants must interpret the information. This
interpretation can be extremely difficult and problematic. The information might be too numerous
and too complex and, thus, not easily or inexpensively interpreted. The information age produces
an enormous and incomprehensible amount of news and data that is impossible to assimilate.
Often, information is vague and its consequences not understandable. Not enough precedent has
occurred to be able to judge what potential consequences are likely from specific information. In
short, information by itself is unreliable and its interpretation subject to logical errors.
Academic studies suggest that it would be extremely costly for market participants to
attain and assimilate perfectly new information. In his book, A Theory of Adaptive Economic
Behavior, Cross (1983) discusses the costliness of solving the complex statistical problems that
modern economic and financial theory assume that individuals in the market are working.
The methodological price for this approach [traditional statistical and mathematical
decision analysis] has been extremely high, however, for it has become necessary to
assume individuals in these markets can be represented as mathematical statisticians
capable of solving specific problems that are often beyond the analytic abilities of
professionals in that field. It also requires reliance on the assumptions that individu-
als follow optimizing rules of behavior under just those dynamic and risky types of
situations for which the assumption of optimization has the least empirical support.

46 Part I Introduction
Some of the optimization problems that market participants would need to be solving are
beyond the analytical abilities of professional statisticians using high-speed computers. G.
Hawawini and D. Keim (1994) argue that markets are not efficient because investors are pre-
vented from optimizing by their inherent cognitive limits. Rode, et al., in a Wharton School
working paper (1995) argue that there are “substantial constraints on the information processing
time allowed,” that “there is also a continual abundance of new information made available,” and
that “this flow of information easily exceeds investor’s abilities to process it completely.” They
argue that because the object of technical analysis is to make sense out of this complex world of
new and continual information, it has created rules that substitute simplified and “less complex
for the intractable.” Basic economic theory teaches that market players will continue the costly
process of gathering and processing information only so long as the cost of doing so is less than
the cost of being wrong. Technical analysis represents a rational choice for bounded rational
investors; it can allow them to make reasonably well-informed decisions with relatively small
information processing costs.
Interpretation is also subject to changes in risk preferences. In his 2004 article, “The Adap-
tive Markets Hypothesis: Market Efficiency from an Evolutionary Perspective,” Andrew Lo
argues that even in the rational market assumed in the EMH, risk aversion is not a constant. Risk
aversion depends on the history of market behavior, and, thus, may be time-varying. For exam-
ple, an investor who had never experienced a stock market collapse before might assume a differ- ptg
ent risk preference structure after losing money in the 1987 crash or the 2007–2009 decline than
he or she had before. This means that even under a rational decision-making assumption, the risk
parameters are not constant. Time-varying risk assumption can also develop when investors trade
based on irrational expectations, and time-varying risk assumptions may arise from the interac-
tions of heterogeneous investors. In short, the assumption that risk assessment is a constant has a
few problems.
Are Investors Rational?
This brings us to the subject of rationality. The EMH assumes that investors as a group will act
rationally. In its more recent version, it also assumes that there are irrational participants, called
“noise” players, in the marketplace (Black, 1986). When noise players, who drive prices away
from intrinsic value, are not counteracted by arbitrageurs, who are called “informed” players, the
market is considered irrational. Thus, individual irrationality can exist in the marketplace, but it
is usually nullified by rational arbitrage.
We will get to the subject of arbitrage shortly, but first let us look at the critiques of ration-
ality. Most have centered on the subjects of behavior and preference of market participants.
Market participant actions depend on how individuals process information and make deci-
sions. Information interpretation and decision making are subject to cognitive bias and limits.
The science of behavioral finance studies the irrational behavior of investors and how they inter-
pret information. Some of the results have shown illogical behavior that would be undesirable in
the marketplace, such as comfort in crowds called “herding” (Huberman and Regev, 2001), over-
confidence based on little information (Fischoff and Slovic, 1980; Barber and Odean, 2001; Ger-
vais and Odean, 2001), overreaction (DeBondt and Thaler, 1985), psychological accounting

Chapter 4 The Technical Analysis Controversy 47
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1983), miscalibration of probabilities (Lictenstein et al., 1982), hyper-
bolic discounting (Laibson, 1997), and regret (Bell, 1982; Clarke et al., 1994). More and more of
these kinds of studies are demonstrating that investors often act irrationally.
Preference in markets is directly related to the assumption that investors are risk averse.
The EMH assumes that investors will be willing to take on more risk only if they are compen-
sated by receiving a higher expected rate of return. Thus, the EMH assumes that investors will
optimize their decisions based on their perception of and ability to assume risk. Many psycholo-
gists and experimental economists have found empirically “specific behavioral biases that are
ubiquitous to human decision-making under uncertainty, several of which lead to undesirable
outcomes for an individual’s economic welfare…” (Lo, 2004).
The most famous early experiment was by Daniel Kahneman of the University of British
Columbia and Amos Tversky (1979) of Stanford in which a number of participants were asked
about preferences for different probability costs and outcomes. Invariably, they chose, when pre-
sented with potential gains, a risk-aversion strategy, and when presented with potential losses, a
risk-seeking strategy. In the financial markets, this kind of decision making can be disastrous. It
suggests that investors have a strong tendency to sell winning positions and to keep losing posi-
tions, quite contrary to the rationality assumption of the EMH. For the duo’s work in behavioral
finance, Kahneman received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002. Unfortunately, Tversky
died in 1996 and was, therefore, ineligible. ptg
Advocates of the EMH argue that although irrational players can sometimes affect prices
for a short time, prices are quickly brought back into equilibrium to their true value by a rational
arbitrage that profits at the expense of the players with irrational beliefs. Thus, prices may stray
from their true value occasionally but will quickly return to them. The stray prices are “noise”
about the true value and provide opportunity for the insightful arbitrageur. Prices always return
to their true value, and irrationality, although it does occur, is never in control of prices because
profitable, competitive arbitrage will always return those prices to their true value.
This brings us to the question of whether arbitrage actually does bring prices back to equi-
librium or whether there are other forces, either of human bias or emotion, that can overwhelm
the rational force of the arbitrageur.
Will Arbitrage Keep Prices in Equilibrium?
Price equilibrium at the intrinsic value of a security in the EMH relies on arbitrageurs acting on
a profit motive to bring prices back to equilibrium if they should stray. In practice, the ability for
arbitrage is less likely than the EMH assumes. It is too risky for reasons other than volatility.
Ideally, risk-averse arbitrage is “the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same, or essen-
tially similar, security in two different markets at advantageously different prices” (Sharpe and
Alexander, 1990). In many market instances, there is no substitutable alternative for the arbi-
trageur, or arbitrageurs are unable to trade alternatives for practical reasons such as lack of liq-
uidity, lack of margin, trading costs, and so on. Arbitrage depends on sufficient liquidity for the
arbitrageur to get into a position and, most important, to get out. In periods of fast markets and
emotional panic, liquidity is often absent, leaving the risk to the arbitrageur that a position can-
not be closed. Trading costs, in addition to slippage from illiquidity, are a concern to the arbi-
trageur. Trading costs must be minimal because with the small spreads involved, they can reduce

48 Part I Introduction
a large portion of potential profit. These factors of liquidity and costs often convince the poten-
tial arbitrageur to go elsewhere to make a profit.
When there is no substitutable alternative for arbitrage, one side or the other of a run away
from the theoretical intrinsic equilibrium value can continue. There is nothing to check it. The
absence of a tradable vehicle to provide a risk-averse arbitrage might not be available. This is
true, for example, in the entire stock and bond market. If “irrational exuberance”1 (a term used by
Yale Professor Robert Shiller) develops, as it did in the 1920s and 1990s, and prices rise signifi-
cantly above their equilibrium value, there is no security that arbitrageurs can use to arbitrate
prices back to their rational value without incurring substantial capital risk. Without an arbitrage
vehicle, prices can trend in one direction without the arbitrage check to bring them back to
rational values.
As opposed to the EMH, technical assumptions include the ability for prices to trend, in
which case the arbitrageur, if he exists, may be overwhelmed by and may even join the consistent
trend of prices away from true value. In addition, when a trend is completed and reverses,
researchers such as DeBondt and Thaler (1985) empirically observe that those prices often trend
in the opposite direction well beyond rational value. This cyclicality in price direction and extent
is assumed by technical analysis to be due to irrational behavior overcoming rational arbitrage.

BOX 4.2 A CASE STUDY IN THE FAILURE OF FINANCIAL THEORY—THE LONG-TERM
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT DEBACLE
The failure of rationality and arbitrage in the face of irrational behavior was empiri-
cally but unfortunately demonstrated by the collapse of Long-Term Capital Manage-
ment (LTCM) in 1998. Managed by extremely knowledgeable and sophisticated
professionals, this fund had two Nobel Prize winners, Scholes and Miller, on its
advisory staff. It leveraged itself by avoiding Federal Reserve margin requirements
and otherwise sane ratios of safety into almost 30-to-1 positions of investments to
cash and controlled thereby over 300 billion dollars’ worth of arbitraged positions. In
addition, it held over a trillion dollars in derivative obligations that, had they failed,
would have brought that amount of exposure to otherwise secure positions in the
banks that were on the other side of these contracts, and it would have forced them to
liquidate also. In other words, LTCM was in a position to bring down the U.S. and
perhaps world financial system if it failed.
One of the problems of pure arbitrage is that the marketplace, over very short time
periods, is efficient enough that bid-ask spreads are extremely small and the poten-
tial profit so minimal that meaningful profit can only come from a very large posi-
tion, similar to a grocery store making many small profits on high turnover. Leverage

apparent origin of the phrase, however, goes back to Hamilton (1922).

must then be used to increase the size of the position. The danger is that although
leverage can increase profit, it can also increase the risk of capital loss to the point
where, depending on the size of the leverage, a small movement against a position
can wipe out the underlying assets. With a 30-to-1 leverage and 300 billion in con-
tracts, a move of only 3.4% against the positions would be enough to wipe out the
fund and force liquidation. This is essentially what happened to LTCM.
Here was a portfolio managed on the most modern versions of finance theory that
collapsed because certain unrealistic assumptions were made, based on the EMH,
and where “mispricing” became worse before it became better, forcing the covering
of positions at the worst time and thus exacerbating the mispricing even more.
Investors flocking to safety and liquidity in the aftermath of the Russian
(debt) default in August 1998 were stronger, at least for several months,
than the forces of rationality. (Lo, 2004)
Thus, even when a series of theoretically riskless spread positions were entered
with rational expectations, the reaction to an event overwhelmed those positions, and
lack of liquidity as well as the pressure of margin calls created a substantial collapse. ptg
Finally, several major banks and brokerage firms, with the insistence and support of
the Federal Reserve, had to take over the assets of LTCM, force it out of business,
and gradually liquidate its positions over time as the market spreads improved.
The lesson learned from this expensive adventure into the EMH was that market
forces may abide by the principles of efficiency a majority of the time, but occasion-
ally and unexpectedly, irrational forces can overwhelm rationality and cause a disas-
ter. Several months after the LTCM debacle, arbitrage professionals analyzed the
LTCM portfolio and agreed that the positions were reasonable, and after a time the
spreads initiated did return to their mean. In other words, had LTCM not been so
highly leveraged and had it been able to withstand the short-term losses, it would
eventually have profited. To achieve a high return on capital, however, LTCM needed
leverage. Leverage introduced another risk, over the risk of volatility—the risk of
ruin. And when the markets ran outside the normal distribution of returns and devel-
oped a “fat tail,” LTCM was out of business. This is why the assumption of a normal
distribution in price returns can be hazardous. It is also why the subject of behavioral
finance was born.
BEHAVIORAL FINANCE AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

50 Part I Introduction
finance studies have pointed to cognitive biases, such as mental accounting, framing, and over-
confidence, which impact investors’ decisions. These studies suggest that investors act irra-
tionally, at times, and can drive prices away from the EMH true value. Investor sentiment and
price anomalies, either as trends or patterns, have been the bulk of technical analysis study. Sen-
timent and psychological behavior have always been the unproven but suspected reason for these
trends and patterns, and human bias has always been in the province of trading system develop-
ment and implementation.
The EMH is based upon a deductive reasoning process. In this deductive reasoning
process, financial economists began with assumptions, such as markets are composed of rational
individuals maximizing utility. Then using logic and increasingly complicated mathematical
equations, they deduced theories that must follow from the assumptions. This deductive
approach results in theories, but as we have seen with the EMH, these theories do not always
square with observations of real-world data.
Those who practice behavioral finance follow an inductive approach of watching real-
world events and looking for patterns. The inductive reasoning process is based upon observa-
tion; a major drawback of the inductive process, however, is that just because a phenomenon has
repeated itself and a pattern is detected, there is no guarantee that the relationship will continue
in the future. To conclude that the phenomenon will continue to occur depends upon subscribing
to a theory of why it would continue. ptg
The deductive process has resulted in the EMH, a theory that has not been supported by
observation. The inductive process of behavioral finance has resulted in a collection of observa-
tions, many which contradict the EMH, but lacks a theory to support the usefulness of these
observations in the future. The evidence presented by behavioral finance supports the use of
technical analysis. However, behavioral finance lacks a theory to explain why the observations
seen occur. Without such a theory, the academic world has been slow to let go of its adherence to
the EMH.
Although the divide between theory and observation remains, progress is occurring as aca-
demics attempt to develop theories that are consistent with market observations. For example,
Andrew Lo (2004) applies principles of evolution such as competition, adaptation, and natural
selection to financial interactions and proposes the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis. Lo claims that
many of the observations behavioralists cite as counterexamples to the EMH are consistent with
an evolutionary model of investors adapting to a changing environment using simple heuristics.
At this point, behavioral finance does not provide an alternative theory to the EMH, but
empirical studies questioning the EMH in its purest form have bolstered the credibility of techni-
cal analysis with more sophisticated investigations of technical rules, and they have added hope
that the academic world will eventually catch up to the real world of markets.
PRAGMATIC CRITICISMS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
In addition to the theoretical criticisms of technical analysis, there are some pragmatic criticisms
of technical analysis.

Chapter 4 The Technical Analysis Controversy 51
Some investors incorrectly believe that technical analysis is only for the short-term trader
and is not useful to the long-term investor. Because new and relevant fundamental information
on a security doesn’t change minute-by-minute or day-by-day, a short-term trader must rely
more on technical analysis. The short-term trader must rely on an interpretation of market price
behavior rather than on news and company announcements. In this instance, technical analysis
gives the trader more of an advantage than fundamental analysis. This happenstance has led to
the incorrect belief that technical analysis is only for the short-term trader. But, technical analy-
sis is the study of price, and people determine prices. People affect long-term prices as much as
short-term prices. Analysis of price behavior over the long term is just as valuable to the investor
as analysis over the short term is to the trader. Indeed, the professional managers who have been
the most successful have been so because they used technical analysis for long-term decisions.
Other opponents of technical analysis claim that if successful, technical analysis would
cancel itself out by being self-fulfilling. A corollary to this claim is that technical rules that
worked in the past might not work in the future. Such a criticism assumes that technical analysis
will fail when all investors practice it, including the self-same critics. So far, the widespread,
ubiquitous use of technical analysis is illusory. Many rules, both technical and fundamental, suf-
fer the fate of becoming too popular. Look at the concept of “diversification” into noncorrelated
assets, an idea much toted before the 2008 stock market decline took all noncorrelated assets
down at the same time. Another example of this phenomenon is the small capital effect. Histori- ptg
cally, smaller capitalized stocks tended to outperform larger capitalized stocks, but this funda-
mental rule no longer holds true. These are investment fads, not principles. Technical analysis,
having been around for hundreds of years, is not a fad. There is no question that methods of pat-
tern analysis seem not to work as well as in the past. This is also a problem with all investment
analysis. As markets become more efficient, competition becomes more fierce and any method
having some modicum of success is quickly jumped on until it becomes neutralized. Although it
occurs with technical analysis, it is not unique to it. As for technical rules working in the future,
who is to say? All rules are subject to change. At least technical analysis works with reliable data;
most rules have been tested; and risk levels can be established to limit loss of capital.
An additional criticism of technical analysis is that most technical rules require subjective
judgment and are, thus, fallible. On the other hand, what form of investment analysis doesn’t
require subjective judgment? Why is technical analysis singled out? Certainly, fundamental ana-
lysts must judge whether to buy, sell, hold, or ignore a security they are analyzing. It is true that
technical analysis of charts is subjective, and some call it an “art” or “skill,” but the demonstra-
tion of data on a chart is just another means of time-series analysis. Most theoreticians also use
charts to clarify their hypotheses. One sure aspect of technical analysis, unlike others, is that the
data used is as timely and accurate as any data can be. Actually, technical analysis is becoming
more “mechanical” as quantitative experts use computers to determine statistical rules for action
and money management. Some believe this may “blow up” and denigrate technical analysis or at
least drive it back to the subjective rules, as did the LTCM debacle for the EMH about arbitrage,
but for now technical analysis is becoming the less subjective of the two major forms of invest-
ment analysis.

52 Part I Introduction
WHAT IS THE EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR TECHNICAL ANALYSIS?
Despite the theoretical criticisms, can technical analysts use past price data to predict future price
movement? Over the years, hundreds of studies have been conducted to test the efficacy of tech-
nical trading rules. Cheol-Ho Park and Scott Irwin conducted one of the most extensive reviews
of these tests. In their 2003 report, they review 92 post-1986 academic studies that tested the
profitability of technical analysis strategies.2
Of the 92 studies reviewed, 58 of the studies concluded that positive results could be
gained from using technical analysis; only 24 of the studies concluded that the use of technical
strategies led to negative results. Under the Random Walk Hypothesis, because prices returns are
independent of each other, no technical trading strategy can be consistently profitable. Believers
in the Random Walk Hypothesis would admit that a strategy could appear to be profitable ex-
post, but that this profitability was simply due to luck, not a successful technical trading rule.
However, the fact that two-thirds of the studies that Park and Irwin reviewed showed positive
results could not be attributed to luck. Of course, as Park and Irwin point out, criticism can be
made of some of the reviewed studies in that the various testing methods used by the researchers
were in some cases subject to data snooping and ex-post selection of trading rules; some of these
studies may also be flawed due to difficulties in estimating risk and transaction costs. It is
ptg
unlikely, however, that all 58 positive studies are at fault for testing deficiencies. Park and Irwin’s
summary results at least show possible refutation of the Random Walk and the Efficient Markets
Hypotheses, something that until recently had not been accomplished with rigorous testing of
trading rules.
CONCLUSION
Like any practical discipline, especially one working with an indefinite and fickle subject such as
the marketplace, technical analysis has problems. The Random Walk Hypothesis is not perfect;
yet at many times, prices appear to behave randomly. The EMH has many holes that cannot be
explained, yet prices seem to be very efficient and the possibility of profit often slim. Fundamen-
tal analysis has its problems, most of which were exaggerated during the market decline in the
early 2000s and more recently in 2007–2009, but there is little question that stock prices, com-
modity prices, and currency rates change over the long run due to the fundamental changes in the
economy and structure of markets. Technical analysis is no different. It has many flaws, is diffi-
cult to learn, is subject to error and bias, and often falls on its face. Nevertheless, technical analy-
sis can be extremely useful to investors wanting to profit from timing and trend riding while
limiting risk.
2. Many tests of technical trading strategies conducted before the mid-1980s focused on only one or two trading systems,
did not test for statistical significance of trading profits, and did not correctly address issues of risk.

REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. You walk into a room where some friends have been playing a coin toss game. They ask
you to guess whether the coin will land on heads or tails on the next toss. Does the fact that
your friends have knowledge about how many heads and tails have already occurred in the
game give them any advantage over you in guessing whether a coin will land on heads or
tails on the next coin toss? Explain.
2. Supporters of the Random Walk Hypothesis claim that stock prices have no “memory.”
What do they mean by this claim?
3. What does the term fat tails mean? How do fat tails differ from the tails that would occur
in a normal distribution?
4. If the probability of a 10% decline in stock prices occurring on any particular day is 1 in
1,000 and stock returns are random, explain why the probability of having a 10% decline
in stock prices on two consecutive days is only 1 in 1,000,000.
5. What are some of the problems associated with information that bring the EMH into ques-
tion?

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you should be familiar with
• The market characteristics required for investors to use technical analysis ptg
• The types of markets in which technical analysis can be used
• The differences between informed, uninformed, and liquidity market players
• The differences between price-weighted, market capitalization weighted, and equally
weighted averages
Technical analysis is widely used in freely traded markets. In the United States and most major
industrial countries, technical analysis is used in the currency, equity, fixed income, and com-
modity markets. Professional traders and investors, as well as individuals who are investing their
own funds, use the techniques of technical analysis. An obvious use of technical analysis is to
make money. Investors attempt to buy a security at a low price and sell it at a high price; techni-
cal analysis helps identify profitable buying and selling opportunities. In addition to aiding the
investor with determining profitable buying and selling opportunities, technical analysis can be
used to manage risk.
For an investor to use technical analysis in a market, easy access, fungibility, sufficient liq-
uidity, and continuous trading must characterize the market. Although there are many freely
traded markets in the world in which technical analysis is used, the most common, and the one
this book will most frequently address, is the U.S. stock market.

58 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
BOX 5.1 FUNGIBILITY
Fungibility is the interchangeability of financial assets on identical terms. Often a
stock, future, or option will be traded on more than one exchange. It is especially
important that the financial asset being purchased on one exchange and sold on
another is fungible. In other words, if a trader buys an S&P contract on the Singapore
exchange and sells the same contract (as defined by asset, amount, currency, and
expiration) on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, he or she must be sure that the con-
tracts are fungible, that they are exactly interchangeable, and they can be cleared
through either exchange. Some exchanges trade the same contracts, but they are not
members of the same clearinghouse, the entity that makes and takes delivery. Thus, a
purchase in one exchange would not be accepted for delivery in the other exchange.
When trading in offshore markets, fungibility can become a serious problem.
ptg
IN WHAT TYPES OF MARKETS CAN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BE USED?
Markets are simply meeting places of buyers and sellers. Markets can be categorized in many
ways. They can be categorized by the assets being traded, the manner in which the borrowers and
lenders meet, or by the type of contract that is executed. Let us begin by dividing markets into
categories based on how organized or integrated the market is. Using this type of division results
in four different types of markets: direct search markets, brokered markets, dealer markets, and
auction markets.
The direct search market is the least organized market structure. With this type of market,
buyers and sellers must seek and find each other directly. For example, suppose that Elizabeth
wants to buy a used washer and dryer for her new apartment. Elizabeth might search the classi-
fied ads in her local newspaper for a seller of a washer and dryer. Generally, low-priced, nonstan-
dard goods are traded in the direct search market. This type of market is characterized by
sporadic participation by the market players.
The next level of market organization, the brokered market, addresses the direct search
market problem of the buyer and seller finding each other. In markets where the volume of trad-
ing in a particular good is sufficiently high, brokers can specialize in bringing buyers and sellers
together. One of the most familiar examples of a brokered market is the real estate market.
Through specialization and economies of scale, the real estate broker is able to provide search
and matching services to clients at a cost much lower than the clients’ private search costs would
be. The broker is able to earn a commission by providing these search and matching services for
the buyer and seller. Brokered investment markets work similarly, with brokers matching buyers
and sellers of financial assets for a commission.
A third type of market structure, the dealer market, arises when the trading in a particular
type of asset becomes sufficiently heavy. Unlike brokers, dealers trade assets for their own
accounts. Specializing in particular types of assets, these dealers post bid and ask prices and

stand ready to buy and sell at these prices. The NASDAQ is an example of a dealer market for
stocks. The dealer offers to buy securities at the bid price and offers to sell the securities at the
ask price. The dealer’s profit margin is known as the bid-ask spread. The dealer market saves
market players search costs by providing readily available information about the prices at which
they can buy and sell securities. The securities traded in dealer markets are usually substitutable
and liquid, with the dealers standing ready to purchase or sell securities providing the liquidity.
Thus, dealer markets generally have the characteristics necessary to use technical analysis.
The most highly integrated market is the auction market. In an auction market, all partici-
pants converge at one place to buy or sell a good. The centralized facility can be a location, a
clearinghouse, or even a computer. An important aspect of the auction market is that all informa-
tion about offers and bids is centralized where it is readily accessible to all buyers and sellers. As
all of the market participants converge, buyers and sellers need not search for each other, and a
mutually agreeable price can be established, eliminating the bid-ask spread. Assets such as art,
jewelry, and antiques are sold in periodic auction markets. The New York Stock Exchange is an
example of a continuous auction market.
Some auction markets can be studied using technical analysis, while others cannot. For
example, auction markets in paintings could not be subject to technical analysis because a paint-
ing is unique and not substitutable with another painting. The auction market for U.S. Treasury
bills, however, can be analyzed with the tools of technical analysis because U.S. Treasury bills ptg
are highly liquid securities and are easily substitutable. Because organized exchanges are struc-
tured for continuous trading in liquid, substitutable assets, they are usually subject to technical
analysis.
TYPES OF CONTRACTS
Now let us look at categorizing markets by the type of contract that is executed. Two broad con-
tract catgories are the cash market and the derivative market. The futures market and the option
market are subcategories of the derivative market. Table 5.1 shows the types of assets that might
be bought and sold in the cash, futures, and option markets.

60 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Cash Market
The cash, or spot, market is the oldest type of market. In the cash market, a contract is entered
into that will result in immediate exchange of the agreed-upon items. Different rules and conven-
tions regarding the meaning of “immediate” apply depending upon the type of asset being
traded. For example, when foreign currencies are being exchanged, delivery is usually instanta-
neous or at least within two days. In the case of common stock, the delivery period is three days.
In the case of cash commodities, each market has its own rules and conventions. Cash indexes
trade almost exactly like common stocks, and their delivery is regulated by the exchanges upon
which they are traded.
The stock market, the most widely recognized cash market, is open to the public. In the
cash commodities markets, the prime producers or consumers of the commodity traded often
dominate. For example, Nestle is a large participant in the cocoa cash market; Exxon is a major
participant in the oil cash market; Citibank is a major participant in the financial cash market
(bonds, notes, fed funds, etc.); and UBS is a principal participant in the FOREX (foreign
exchange) cash market.
As technical analysts, the cash markets in which we are principally interested are the com-
mon stock and index cash markets that are available on the public stock exchanges. Cash markets
can be leveraged but not usually as much as the other vehicles. The amount of leverage in the ptg
stock market, as well as the option market, is controlled by the Federal Reserve and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, but various ways of getting around the regulations have
been developed through the use of derivative markets and private arrangements with lenders.
Nevertheless, the average trader or investor is bound by the Federal Reserve regulations, which
presently require that for stocks and indexes, a minimum of 50% of market value must be in cash
for overnight positions and 25% for intraday positions. This means that the trader or investor can
have a 2-to-1 margin for overnight holdings and a 4-to-1 margin for pattern trades intraday. For
each $1, up to $2 in securities can be purchased or sold short overnight, and $4 in securities can
be held within the day. There are different rules for day traders, for holders of U.S. Treasury
securities, for market makers, and for shares selling under $5, and the various exchanges and
brokerage firms can have tighter margin requirements if they want. Before contemplating the use
of margin, the investor or trader should inquire at the intended brokerage firm what rules and reg-
ulations would be applicable to the trading or investing style desired.
Liquidity in the cash stock markets is excellent. The volume of trades and amount of
money transacted each day suggest that willing buyers and sellers can always be found. The only
time that the U.S. exchanges adjust trading or close down is when the exchange’s computers go
down, when a major event or severe weather affecting the United States occurs, or when the
stock averages rise or decline a certain large amount, say in a panic. In the instance of a large
price change, the NYSE reacts in two ways depending on its severity. When predetermined lim-
its, called circuit breakers, based on a percentage change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
are reached, the exchange closes down all trading for a limited time. As of the first quarter of
2010, for example, should the Dow decline more than 1,050 points (10%) in a day before 2:00
p.m. EST, the exchange would close for an hour. After 2:00 p.m. but before 2:30 p.m., it would
close for 1/2 hour, and after 2:30 p.m., it wouldn’t close at all. Should the Dow decline 2,100
points (20%) within a day, the exchange would stop trading for two hours unless it was after 2:00

p.m., in which case it would close for the day. Should the Dow decline 3,150 (30%) points within
the day, the exchange would halt trading for the remainder of the day. The limits adjust each
quarter based on the Dow level for the previous quarter and have only triggered a shutdown once,
on October 27, 1997, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 550 points by 3:30 p.m.
BOX 5.2 EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND (ETF)
In the past 20 years, a security called an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that replicates
an index fund or a basket of assets has become extremely popular as a trading and a
hedging vehicle.
History—A failed attempt to create a similar investment vehicle in 1989 at the
American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange was the first ETF-
type security. It intended to simulate the S&P 500. A year later, the Toronto Stock
Exchange successfully introduced freely traded index funds of Canadian stocks,
emulating the Toronto Stock Exchange 35 and 100 averages.
Nathan Most (who died in December 2004 at the age of 90), an executive of the
American Stock Exchange, seeing the success of the funds in Toronto, created in ptg
1993 the first such fund to replicate the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. It was a
Standard & Poor’s Depository Receipt (SPDR), and the ticker symbol was SPY.
Consequently, it earned the nickname “Spyder” that is now seen on the TV ads. It is
the most traded ETF traded, even today.
Structure—ETFs hold assets, similar to a mutual fund. Ordinarily, large institu-
tional dealers buy and sell shares directly from the ETFs in exchange for large blocks
of the underlying assets in the fund. These dealers then become market makers in
these ETF shares and trade them on the exchanges similarly to common stocks.
Because the shares are backed by the underlying assets, arbitrage keeps their value
close to the price of the underlying assets. From the retail standpoint, the ETF is then
equivalent to a mutual fund with liquidity. The difference between them and mutual
funds is that they trade all day, can be bought or sold at any time during the day, and
unlike closed-end funds, trade with only a very small discount. (The Wall Street
Journal, November 2008, reported an average deviation of 1% during the market tur-
bulence of that time, and as high as 10% in some thinly traded issues.) As retail
demand for the ETF increases, a small temporary premium develops that incites the
dealers to exchange more assets for the ETF shares. The constant arbitrage between
the assets prices and the ETF price keep the two generally in parity.
The largest ETF with the most trading volume is still the Spyder, but numerous
others have come on the market. Close behind are the QQQQs (the “Cubes”), repli-
cating the NASDAQ 100, and the DIAs (“Diamonds”), replicating the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
Advantages—In most cases, ETFs distribute dividends (or reinvest them), thus
eliminating the dividend spread seen in the index futures and options markets; they

are taxed like stocks; and they do not require an uptick to be sold short. They have a
lower expense ratio than mutual funds and do not have load fees, redemption fees, or
short-term trading fees. The cost of transacting them is a normal brokerage fee just
as if they were stocks. Capital gains are payable upon sale of the ETF, unlike with
mutual funds where a capital gain can be incurred during the ownership period.
Finally, ETFs, by their nature, are transparent. You, as the investor, know exactly
what assets the ETF holds, unlike a mutual fund that may buy and sell assets
between reporting periods.
Styles—Replication of stock market indexes is the most common form of ETF.
Next in popularity are commodities ETFs (and a variant called Exchange Traded
Commodities). These invest in commodities such as precious metals, energy, and
agriculturals. There are hidden dangers in holding these investment vehicles because
their underlying is often a position in the futures markets and are rolled forward with
each expiration, causing a “cost to roll” above the value of the underlying commod-
ity. Finally, there are three other important styles: U.S. government bond funds, cur-
rency funds, and actively managed funds.
Leverage—ETFs can be leveraged just as if they were common stocks under the
Federal Reserve margin regulations. However, in the past few years, leveraged funds ptg
appeared that promise to double or triple daily returns both upward and downward
(called inverse funds). The speculator can now leverage a position beyond the mar-
gin requirements, but at the same time also expose a position to larger risk of capital
loss. These leveraged funds incur additional costs during volatile markets because
they are backed by various derivative positions that are bought and sold continually
to balance the underlying portfolio risk.
Derivative Markets
The term derivative describes a financial contract that “derives” its value from some other
investment vehicle, often called the underlying. The primary use for derivatives is to hedge
against risk of loss in the underlying or to speculate with high leverage. Aside from the risk of
loss from the hedge or speculation decreasing in value, both hedging and speculation take on
additional risks such as counterparty risk, the risk that the party on the other side of the deriva-
tive contract may fail to deliver. However, most derivatives have not had this problem, and are
used principally to transfer risk between investing parties. In this sense, derivatives are thought to
cushion economic downturns. In specific instances, however, the derivative market increased
volatility, as occurred during the “insurance programs” in 1987, when equity portfolio managers
to protect against losses in their portfolios sold S&P 500 futures as the market declined and thus
contributed further to the market decline that turned into a crash in prices not seen ever before.
The most common derivatives are futures, options, and swaps, traded either on exchanges,
where their prices are visible, or over the counter, where their prices are hidden. The principal
underlying vehicles are commodities, equities, FOREX, interest rates, and credit markets.

Futures Markets
Futures contracts that are traded in the futures markets are contracts in which the buyer and seller
agree to trade at specific terms at a specific future date. Futures markets are often incorrectly
called commodity markets more from historical usage than as a realistic description. Futures
markets first developed in the agricultural markets as forward contracts, mostly in the grain mar-
kets, to provide a hedge for farmers and banks against crop failure or surplus. To understand the
development of the futures market, suppose that you are a wheat farmer. You are concerned about
the market price of wheat at harvest time. If the price is not as high as you anticipated because of
a bumper crop of wheat, your profits will suffer. American Bread Company (ABC) is also con-
cerned about the price of wheat, although ABC’s concern is the opposite of yours. ABC’s fear is
that a poor wheat crop will lead to rising wheat prices, which translates into higher input costs
and lower profits for ABC. You and ABC can ease your concerns by entering into a forward con-
tract. In this forward contract, you would agree to sell a particular amount of wheat to ABC at a
particular future date and at a price you set now. This reduces your risk and ABC’s risk, you
know what to expect as far as your income, and ABC locks in the price of its input.
Although individuals wrote forward contracts for many years, the contracts were first
traded in the United States on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in 1848. However, the trad-
ing was cumbersome because the contracts were nonstandard: They each had different delivery
ptg
dates and different commodity quality specifications. To address this issue, the CBOT developed
the standardized contracts we know today as “futures contracts” in 1865 (Brecht, 2003).
The CBOT, often referred to as “The Board of Trade,” is the oldest futures exchange in
North America. Ironically, the largest is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group), often
called the “Merc,” that now owns the CBOT and the NYMEX. Today, there are a number of
futures exchanges throughout the world, many specializing in contracts of specific underlying
assets. Futures exchanges are becoming a minigrowth industry as developing nations are organ-
izing markets to trade especially in local products. As Table 5.2 demonstrates, some of the largest
futures exchanges are outside of North America.

64 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Futures, unlike stocks, are contracts and represent an agreement to purchase or sell a very
specific amount and quality of asset at the expiration date. Most nonfinancial contracts are either
closed in the marketplace by selling or buying before their first delivery day or are “delivered.”
For example, if you own one contract in sugar and do not sell it before the delivery day, you are
obligated legally to accept delivery of several railroad boxcar loads of sugar at your railhead.
Major dealers in these commodities have the facilities to take or make delivery; most speculators
do not. When a trader buys a futures contract then, he does not own anything other than an obli-
gation to take delivery on the delivery day of the commodity underlying the contract. Because
the contract is not a specific title of ownership, it is never executed until the delivery day. It is
traded back and forth between buyers and sellers, similar to how musical chairs are played, only
the music stops on delivery day. Financial futures contracts are different from commodity futures
contracts in that they settle on delivery day with cash based on the closing prices of the underly-
ing securities or index.
When a position is initiated in a futures contract, the brokerage firm requires a good faith
deposit that requires the trader to make good on any fluctuation in the contract price value. As
the price of the contract rises and declines, the good faith deposit is increased or decreased by the
amount of the price value change. When the deposit declines below a certain level, the brokerage
firm requires that more funds be added to the account. Otherwise, the brokerage firm closes the
position. ptg
Margin requirements change as the price of the contract changes, as the price level or
volatility changes, or if the exchange determines that the price may change significantly.
Exchanges determine the minimum requirements for their contracts, and brokers may set rates
higher but not lower than the exchange requirements. There are two types of margin—initial and
maintenance. Initial is the amount necessary in the account before an order can be placed. Main-
tenance margin is the minimum amount necessary to keep an account active. This margin
changes each day with the movement of the contract price.
Futures contracts trade in a series of contract months, and each is a unique contract group.
The May 2005 Heating Oil futures are different from the June 2005 Heating Oil futures. They are
substitutable for their specific contract months but not for each other. On a futures contract, the
expiration day, the specific description of the underlying, and the contract size are constants
while the price fluctuates. Financial futures are the same in this respect. Their expiration months
are quarterly (March, June, September, and December) for each year.
The advantages of futures relative to stocks are many. Futures do not require an uptick for
short-selling; they are highly leveraged; and they have a favorable tax benefit. Any futures trade is
automatically allocated 60% to long-term gain/loss and 40% to short-term gain/loss. Furthermore,
at year-end, the brokerage firm sends only one piece of paper with the net gain or loss for the year
rather than a wheelbarrow full of transaction tickets needed to fill out the IRS Schedule D.
The danger of futures centers on its leverage and, in some instances, its illiquidity. Coun-
terparty risk is alleviated through guarantees enforced by the exchanges on all participating par-
ities. The margin requirement for most futures contracts is less than 10%. It is not required that
futures traders use all their margin. Indeed, prudent money management would suggest other-
wise, but the danger of trading without protective stops (see Chapters 13, “Breakouts, Stops, and
Retracements,” 22, “System Design and Testing,” and 23, “Money and Risk Management,” for
usage of stop orders) and a reasonable money management method (see Chapter 23) has been the

Chapter 5 An Overview of Markets 65
ruination of many traders. The other major danger is in more illiquid futures markets where what
is called a limit day occurs. Some futures have daily range limits. This practice has declined over
the past few years to the point where some futures have limits only for contracts older than the
spot month. Nevertheless, a daily price limit, when applicable, means that once the daily range
limit from open to high or low is reached, trading in that contract is shut down. If one has a stop
order that was not executed when the range was exceeded and the market shut down, too bad.
Sometimes several range or daily limit days occur in a row and no trading takes place at all. On
a highly leveraged position on the wrong side of the market, this can be ruinous. In the liquid
markets such as the financial markets, a limit day is rarely seen because the liquidity of the mar-
ket is so strong. Nevertheless, a limit day is a risk to be considered.
BOX 5.3 CONCURRENT EXPIRATION OF OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS
One cross-vehicle effect that can influence price action in all three market vehicles in
the stock market especially is the expiration of option and futures contracts. On each
concurrent expiration date or shortly before, the prices of all three vehicles can be
affected by the crosscurrents between each vehicle expiring and its underlying secu-
rity. This is even more complicated when the underlying security is itself a deriva- ptg
tive. For example, options on index futures expire on the same day and are priced at
the same time. Depending on the number of options being exercised on that day and
the number of futures also coming due that day, the markets in the underlying can
become hectic. From the viewpoint of the technical analyst, almost none of the price
action from such expiration activity has any meaning for the future of the underlying
prices. Nevertheless, limit and stop orders can sometimes be triggered, causing nec-
essary adjustments in a portfolio.
Option Markets
An option contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to complete the transaction
stated in the contract before the expiration date of the contract. There are two basic types of
options—call options and put options. The call option gives the owner the option to buy an asset
at a particular price, known as the strike price, before the option expiration date. The owner of a
put option has the right to sell the stated asset at the strike price before the option expiration date.
Technical analysis is useful in the cash and futures vehicles but not so much in the options
markets. Option markets usually have a short life span and with certain exceptions, such as the
index options, less liquidity than the other vehicles. Because options are derivatives of the cash
or futures markets (the “underlying” markets), often these markets are analyzed first and then
trading rules are applied to the options markets. For example, in the S&P 500 futures, a technical
buy signal may be generated and the trader, instead of acting on the future, will buy the call, sell
the put, or create some kind of combination of calls and puts. This is extremely dangerous for the

novice because options include sizable leverage risk and other complications. Options are a sub-
ject all their own and are not covered in this book. Because options are derivatives of other vehi-
cles, the student should well understand the cash and futures market before studying or entering
the options markets.
Most options trade on exchanges. However, there are esoteric options that trade over the
counter in an invisible market between large institutions. These options include the credit default
options (CDO) that caused so many problems in the recent financial breakdown. These markets
are not freely traded, nor are prices readily available for technical analysis. Within institutions
that trade such vehicles, prices may be available for study, but for the public they are not.
Swaps and Forwards
Swaps and forwards are traded over the counter, not on exchanges where prices are continuous
and visible. Often, these contracts are specific to the parties only, not transferable, not freely
traded, and do not have continuous prices. For these reasons, technical analysis is impossible.
Swaps are contracts between parties agreeing to swap certain investment vehicles, one interest
rate vehicle for another, for example. Forwards are swap agreements to swap similar investment
vehicles sometime in the future. Repurchase agreements, for example, where one agrees to sell
and then repurchase Treasury bills are forward swaps. Technical analysis is inapplicable to most ptg
of these contracts because they are not freely traded or substitutable with continuous prices.
Indeed, in many cases, these contracts cannot be valued.
HOW DOES A MARKET WORK?
To understand the principles of technical analysis, we must be familiar with how markets work
and who the players might be. To better understand how market prices are set, let us begin with a
hypothetical trading example. Let us assume that we are watching the trading post on the New
York Stock Exchange where the stock of an imaginary company International Business Products
(IBP) is being traded during normal trading hours.
Assume that a specialist who has an interest in the stock of IBP is present; this specialist’s
job is to stabilize the price of IBP’s stock. In addition, several floor traders are present; these
floor traders represent off-floor interests in the stock. The first off-floor interest is a mutual fund
that wants to purchase the stock because its analyst believes the company’s earnings are going to
rise suddenly and rapidly. The analyst has determined this expectation from studying the finan-
cial statements of IBP and from interviewing IBP’s management. The second off-floor interest is
a group of investors from a golf club in New Jersey who have heard of the profits one member of
the club has gained from buying IBP earlier in the year. They also are interested in buying the
stock but have no other information than what they have heard about their friend’s profits. The
third off-floor interest is a pension fund that currently owns IBP stock. This pension fund has
made a substantial profit in IBP but now wants to sell its holdings because it has determined that
the stock is overpriced. The fourth off-floor interest is an estate that owns the stock and needs to
liquidate the position to raise cash to pay taxes. The fifth off-floor interest is a hedge fund that

has been watching the stock price change and is flexible enough to either buy or sell shares but
has no particular opinion about the prospects for the company.
Thus, the players in this hypothetical marketplace can be summarized as
1. A specialist whose job is to stabilize the price of IBP
2. A mutual fund that desires to accumulate shares of IBP because it believes the earnings of
IBP will improve rapidly
3. A group of investors acting on the fact that IBP’s stock has risen in the past
4. A pension fund that already owns shares of IBP and believes the current price is too high
5. An estate that owns shares of IBP and must sell them to raise cash
6. A hedge fund that is attempting to trade the shares of IBP but has no opinion about the
prospects for IBP as a company
Notice that the players have different sources of information, different interpretations of
that information, different reasons for trading IBP’s stock, different time horizons, and different
expectations. The mutual fund believes in the analyst’s recommendation that the prospects for
the company will improve immediately and wants to buy because it expects the price to rise. On
ptg
the other hand, the pension fund believes the price of the shares is already too high and wants to
sell, not necessarily because it expects the price to decline but because the possibility of future
rises is diminishing. One or the other will end up correct, depending on how the stock performs
in the future. In addition to these major players is the estate that wants to sell the stock to raise
cash. It has no interest in the company and only wants the money from the sale. Its information
is the necessity to raise cash and its interpretation is to sell the stock. The specialist may have an
opinion and expectations about the company, but his responsibility is to stabilize the market for
its shares. He will step in and buy or sell to provide liquidity and to keep the share price from ris-
ing or declining sharply. He will thus be acting contrary to the direction of the stock price, buy-
ing when it dips and selling when it rallies. The hedge fund will try to take advantage of
anomalies, times when the stock seems to be out of balance with either its trend or its value.
Finally, the golf club members are interested in buying the stock only because someone they
know has made money in it. They expect to realize a sizable profit.
These different types of players are just examples. In real markets, of course, the number
of players is huge, and information and interpretation of that information are equally as vast.
Players buy and sell based on their interpretation of information. In some cases, that information
might have nothing to do with the company and might not even be accurate. The estate sale, for
example, is based on information that the estate needs cash, and the golf club members are buy-
ing stock purely on the information that someone else has made money in it. It is possible that the
estate does not need the cash or that the member claiming the outstanding profit is lying. Players
might interpret the information incorrectly; they might not care about the company at all; or they
might act strictly emotionally, based on either greed or fear (in the case of a sudden and unex-
pected decline). The net result is a transaction between opposing players at a specific price. That
price reflects the sum of all the information and interpretation by all players at that instant in
time.

68 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Now what happens to that price when the players interact over time? Obviously, each new
price reflects a new sum of interpretation. Say the last price of IBP was $50.0. The mutual fund
is anxious to buy the stock and bids 50.0 for 20,000 shares. The pension fund, not being as anx-
ious, offers 10,000 shares at 50.4 and 10,000 shares at 50.6, all it has to sell. This is a standoff, as
a new price has yet to be established. The specialist, judging that the spread between the bid and
offer is too wide and surmising from his information that the buyer is larger than the seller, offers
1,000 shares at 50.1 because he cannot outbid the buyer above the last price. At the same time,
the golf club members enter an order to buy 1,000 shares at the market. This trades at 50.1
against the specialist’s offer. Now a new price has been established at 50.1, higher than the pre-
vious price of 50.0. The sum of all expectations has changed slightly to the upside. Now the
estate comes in and sells its 10,000 shares at the market, which is the 20,000-share mutual fund
bid at 50.0. The new price is back to 50.0 on higher volume. The hedge fund, seeing that the
10,000 shares were easily traded at 50.0, believes there is a large buyer at 50.0 and buys the pen-
sion fund’s 10,000 shares at 50.4. Remember that each time a trade occurs, one player is willing
to buy at that price and another player is willing to sell an identical number of shares at the same
price; there is always a buyer and a seller for every transaction that takes place. Also, it is impor-
tant to remember that the individual players know their own motivation for buying and selling,
but they do not know with whom they are trading or why the other party wants to enter the trans-
action. The players only see the price and the volume of shares traded. ptg
Thus, we have a series of transactions at different prices and different volumes reflecting
the interpretation of different information by the different players. The mutual fund and pension
fund are interpreting fundamental information about the company and the value of its stock rela-
tive to that information. The specialist is using knowledge of what exists in the way of bids and
offers; the hedge fund is watching the tape; and the estate and golf club members are acting with-
out regard to price but on information having to do with practicality in the case of the estate and
emotion in the case of the golf club members. As long as the players on both sides of the transac-
tion are fairly balanced, the price of the stock will oscillate in a relatively small zone, as it has in
our example. If one of the factions (buyers or sellers) overwhelms the other, the price will adjust
accordingly. The reasons for the adjustment in price are unimportant. What is important to the
trader or investor is that the price moves in such a manner that its direction can be determined or
confirmed from past experience. This is why technical analysts study price behavior. It discounts
all known information and interpretation and considers only what the price action implies about
future price action.
WHO ARE THE MARKET PLAYERS?
From the preceding example, it is obvious that a number of different individuals participate in
establishing the price of a security. Academia has divided these types of participants into three
separate categories: informed, noise, and liquidity players.

Chapter 5 An Overview of Markets 69
The early Efficient Markets Hypothesis presumed that only informed investors acted
within the marketplace to establish a price. These players supposedly interpreted new informa-
tion rationally and adjusted the market price of a security to its equilibrium value immediately.
This strict interpretation has been relaxed considerably. Now the informed investor is considered
similar to the more historical type, called the “professional or smart money investor,” who can be
just as affected by bias and misinformation as any other investor or trader. Professional specula-
tors, position traders, hedge fund managers, professional arbitrageurs, and insiders are consid-
ered to be in this category.
Noise is a term coined by Fisher Black (Black, 1986) and is used to describe the random
activity around the equilibrium price. Academically, the uninformed market participants are the
noise players. A more widespread and older term is the public. Most mutual fund managers,
pension fund managers, traders, and technical analysts are considered also to be in this category,
even if they are professionals. The distinction between informed and uninformed is blurry, of
course, and it’s only useful in certain sentiment statistics generated by each group (see Chapter 7,
“Sentiment”). All types of participants are human and subject to the same universal human biases
and cognitive limitations.
Liquidity players are market participants who affect prices in the markets for other rea-
sons than investment or trading. An earlier example is the estate that wants to liquidate securities
for needed cash. This type of player makes no investment decision but affects the market for a ptg
very short time with its liquidation. Another example is the index fund that is forced to buy and
sell a security based on its addition to or deletion from the index that the fund is following. This
causes an outside effect on each security’s price with no regard for its investment value by itself.
Too often, these three participant types are considered as separate and distinct groups.
However, they are changing constantly. Arbitrageurs sometimes act as uninformed players,
members of the public learn and change categories, insiders misjudge the marketplace, and so
on. Experience, as well as knowledge, is important and also changing. In short, the marketplace
is not a stable system headed in a straight line toward equilibrium. The interaction is dynamic
and nonlinear. The system is complex.
HOW IS THE MARKET MEASURED?
As more of the market players want to buy stocks and fewer want to sell their stock holdings,
stock prices will be driven up. Likewise, if many market players want to sell their stocks relative
to the number of participants who want to buy stocks, stock prices will fall. Looking at the
increase or decrease in the price of one stock will tell us how strong the market for that one par-
ticular stock is. If we want to measure the overall direction of the stock market, however, we
need a way of measuring the movement of the broad market that is composed of the stocks of
many companies.
Though the origins of the U.S. stock market date back to 1792 when 24 New York City
stockbrokers and merchants gathered under a buttonwood tree and signed the Buttonwood
Agreement, it was almost 100 years later before the concept of a measure of overall market

movement was developed. At the end of the nineteenth century, Charles H. Dow began publish-
ing a representative average of stocks. Dow intended to gauge overall market trends by looking
at the combined stock price movement of nine railroad stocks, the blue chips of the day. As we
discussed in Chapter 3, “History of Technical Analysis,” Dow’s initial average developed into the
Dow Jones Industrial Average that we have today. Dow’s work also led to the development of the
Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Dow Jones Utility Average.
Building on Dow’s initial concept, other individuals have also developed averages, or
indices, to measure market movement. Today there are almost as many averages or indices as
there are stocks. Although the concept of a market average or index might be simple, choosing a
method to use to construct the index is complicated. There are three major types of index con-
struction: price weighted, market capitalization weighted, and equally weighted.
Price-Weighted Average
The Dow Jones averages are price-weighted averages. This means that the prices for each of the
component stocks are added together, and the sum is divided by a divisor that has changed over
the years to account for splits and stock dividends in each of the component stocks. To see how a
price-weighted average is constructed, consider the four hypothetical stocks in Table 5.3. A
ptg
price-weighted average for each trading day is calculated by simply adding the four prices and
dividing by four. The problem with a price-weighted average is that a high-priced stock will have
more influence on the average than a lower-priced stock. Note that between trading Day 1 and
Day 2, the price of Alpha increased by 10%, while the price of the other three stocks remained
constant; this led to a 3.8% increase in the value of the price-weighted index. On the following
trading day, the price of Delta rose by 10% and the price of the other three stocks did not change.
When the lower-priced Delta increased in value by 10%, the price-weighted index only changed
by 0.9%. The price-weighted average does not represent the usual manner in which a portfolio is
constructed. Investors rarely invest in an equal number of shares in each portfolio stock.

Chapter 5 An Overview of Markets 71
Market Capitalization Weighted Average
Another way to calculate a market index is to use market capitalization in the weighting scheme.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is a market capitalization weighted index, in which each of the
500 stocks is weighted by its market value. The NYSE composite index, the NASDAQ compos-
ite index, and the Russell Indexes are also capitalization weighted. An interesting change in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index began in the spring of 2005. Rather than calculating the index
based on the shares outstanding in each company, Standard & Poor’s index now calculates based
on the float of each stock. Float is a term used to describe the number of shares actually available
to the marketplace for purchase or sale. In many companies, some stock is held in the treasury,
some has been given to employees in the form of options, some has been reissued in secondary
offerings, and some is held closely by entities such as pension funds, foundations, other compa-
nies, owners, or syndicates. These closely held shares are generally not available for normal day-
to-day transactions and are, thus, eliminated from the calculation of the index. The purpose in
this new calculation is to reduce the influence on the index by the amount of capital value that is
locked up and not available to the market.
To compare how this index construction differs from price weighting, refer to Table 5.3. To
begin creating a market capitalization weighted index, an initial market value of all the included
stocks is calculated. In our example, this would be accomplished by multiplying each stock’s ptg
price by the number of shares outstanding on Day 1. This gives a value of 1,270,000,000. This
initial figure is the base and is assigned an index value, usually of 100. Then a new market value
is calculated for all of the securities each trading day. This new value is compared with the initial
base level to calculate a daily index value. The general formula for calculating the daily index
level is
PQ
Index t = t t (cid:2) Beginning Index Value
P Q
b b
Index = Market capitalization weighted index on Day t
t
P = Closing stock prices on Day t
t
Q = Number of outstanding shares for stocks on Day t
t
P = Closing stock prices on initial base day
b
Q = Number of outstanding shares for stocks on initial base day
b
Because of the weighting scheme used, stocks with a large number of shares outstanding
and high prices have a disproportionate influence on a market capitalization weighted index. In
the Table 5.3 sample data, one stock increased in value by 10% while all of the other stocks
remained the same on Days 2, 3, and 4. Look at how much more sensitive the index was to
changes when the stock had a relatively high price or number of shares outstanding. Just as the

price-weighted index is not representative of how most investors purchase stocks, neither is the
market capitalization weighted index. An investor seldom invests in stocks in proportion to their
market capitalization.
Equally Weighted (or Geometric) Average
A third method of calculating an index uses equal weighting of all included stocks. Sometimes,
the term unweighted index is used to refer to this type of average because all stocks carry equal
weight, regardless of their price or market value. This index is calculated by averaging the per-
centage price changes of each of the stocks included in the group. As you can see in Table 5.3, it
does not matter which stock increases by a particular percent. For each of the sample trading
days, one stock increased in value by 10% while the other three stocks remained unchanged;
each day, the equally weighted average index increased by 2.5%.
This index calculation is a dollar-weighted average; in other words, it assumes that an
investor invests equal dollar amounts in each stock. For example, an investor with $10,000 would
purchase $2,500 worth of each of the four stocks in our example. Thus, the investor would be
purchasing fewer shares of the high price per share stocks and more shares of the low price per
share stocks. This calculation most closely represents how the typical investor goes about organ-
izing a portfolio. ptg
Several of the Value Line averages are equal weighted averages that are calculated using an
arithmetic average of the percent changes. However, one of the Value Line averages, the Value
Line Industrials Average, and the Financial Times Ordinary Share Index are equally weighted
averages that are constructed in a slightly different manner. These two indices are computed
using a geometric average of the holding period returns. Table 5.4 demonstrates the calculation
of a geometric average for the four-stock portfolio example.

Day 4 88 1 85 1 27.5 1.1 22 1 1.1 1.024 107.410
Comparing this geometric average with the equally weighted average calculated for the
same stocks shows a downward bias when using a geometric average rather than an arithmetic
average. An investor who had purchased $100 of each of these four stocks on Day 1 and held
each of these stocks for all four days would have an ending wealth of $430, or 7.5% greater than
the beginning wealth level of $400. The geometric weighted index shows a change of 7.41%.

Chapter 5 An Overview of Markets 73
CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we have explored the basics of how markets work. Because our interest lies in the
area of using technical analysis, we have focused on markets in which substitutable, liquid, con-
tinuously traded assets are bought and sold. In these markets, we find informed, uninformed, and
liquidity players buying and selling securities and, thus, affecting the price of these securities. As
technical analysts, we are concerned with observing and predicting price movements as these
various market players go about their trading. Market indices are used to measure the overall
price movement in the marketplace.
As we continue through Part II, “Markets and Market Indicators,” we build upon these
basic ideas. The focus of Chapter 6, “Dow Theory,” is Dow Theory and the basic fundamental
relationships between markets and the economy. In Chapter 7, “Sentiment,” we focus on the mar-
ket players; we examine the notion of sentiment: how emotions and human biases impact the
behavior of both the informed and uninformed market participants. Chapter 8, “Measuring Mar-
ket Strength,” focuses on measuring the strength of the market. Going beyond the indices we use
to measure historical market performance, we examine indicators that measure the market’s abil-
ity to maintain its performance into the future. Chapter 9, “Temporal Patterns and Cycles,”
addresses temporal tendencies; historically, analysts have found seasonal and cyclical tendencies
ptg
in the marketplace that impact price movements. Finally, in Chapter 10, “Flow of Funds,” we
address the movement of money in the marketplace, known as the “flow of funds.”

Charles H. Dow was the founder of the Dow-Jones financial news service in New
York, and founder and first editor of the Wall Street Journal. He died in December,
1902, in his fifty-second year. He was an experienced newspaper reporter, with an
early training under Samuel Bowles, the great editor of the Springfield [MA] Repub-
lican. Dow was a New Englander, intelligent, self-repressed, ultra-conservative; and
he knew his business. He was almost judicially cold in the consideration of any sub-
ject, whatever the fervor of discussion. It would be less than just to say that I never
saw him angry; I never saw him excited. His perfect integrity and good sense com-
manded the confidence of every man in Wall Street, at a time when there were few
efficient newspaper men covering the financial section, and of these still fewer with
any deep knowledge of finance. (Hamilton, 1922)

76 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Charles Dow, the father of modern technical analysis, was the first to create an index that meas-
ures the overall price movement of U.S. stocks. However, he never specifically formulated what
has become known as the “Dow Theory.” Indeed, he likely never intended his disjointed state-
ments and observations in the Wall Street Journal to become formalized. He wrote editorials
about what he had learned from his experience as a reporter and advisor on Wall Street but never
organized these individual pieces into a coherent theory. In fact, he only wrote for five years
before his sudden death in 1902. The term “Dow Theory” was first used by Dow’s friend, A. C.
Nelson who wrote in 1902 an analysis of Dow’s Wall Street Journal editorials called The A B C
of Stock Speculation.
After Dow’s death, William Peter Hamilton succeeded him as editor of the Wall Street
Journal. For over a quarter of a century, from 1902 until his death in 1929, Hamilton continued
writing Wall Street Journal editorials using the tenets of Dow Theory. Hamilton also described
the basic elements of this theory in his book, The Stock Market Barometer, in 1922.
Alfred Cowles III (1937) performed the first formal test of the profitability of trading using
the tenets of Dow Theory in 1934. Cowles was an early theoretician of the stock market and used
statistical methods to determine if Hamilton could “beat the market.” Cowles found that a portfo-
lio based on Hamilton’s theory lagged the return on a portfolio fully invested in a market index
that Cowles had developed. (Cowles’s index was a predecessor of the S&P 500.) Therefore,
Cowles determined that Hamilton could not outperform the market and concluded that Dow The- ptg
ory of market timing results in returns that lag the market. Cowles’s study, considered a seminal
piece in the statistical testing of market-timing strategies, provided a foundation for the Random
Walk Hypothesis and the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.
In recent years, however, researchers have reexamined Cowles’s work using more sophis-
ticated statistical techniques. In the August 1998 Journal of Finance, an article by Brown, Goet-
zmann, and Kumar demonstrated that adjusted for risk (Hamilton was out of the market for a
portion of his articles), Hamilton’s timing strategies yield high Sharpe ratios and positive alphas
for the period 1902 to 1929. In other words, contrary to Cowles’s original study, Brown, Goetz-
mann, and Kumar conclude that Hamilton could time the market very well using Dow Theory. In
addition, they found that when Hamilton’s decisions were replicated in a neural network model
of out-of-sample data from September 1930 through December 1997, Hamilton’s methods still
had validity. His methods worked especially well in sharp market declines and considerably
reduced portfolio volatility.
After Hamilton’s death, Robert Rhea further refined what had become known as Dow The-
ory. In 1932, Rhea wrote a book called The Dow Theory: An Explanation of Its Development and
an Attempt to Define Its Usefulness as an Aid to Speculation. In this book, Rhea described Dow
Theory in detail, using the articles by Hamilton, and formalized the tenets into a series of
hypotheses and theorems that are outlined next.
Rhea presented three hypotheses:
1. The primary trend is inviolate.
2. The averages discount everything.
3. Dow Theory is not infallible.

Chapter 6 Dow Theory 77
The first of these hypotheses dealt with the notion of manipulation. Although Rhea
believed that the secondary and the minor, day-to-day motion of the stock market averages could
possibly be manipulated, he claimed that the primary trend is inviolate. The second hypothesis,
that the averages discount everything, is because prices are the result of people acting on their
knowledge, interpretation of information, and expectations. The third hypothesis is that Dow
Theory is not infallible. Because of this, investment requires serious and impartial study.
BOX 6.1 SOME OF WILLIAM HAMILTON’S THOUGHTS ON THE STOCK MARKET AND THE
DOW THEORY
The sum and tendency of the transactions in the Stock Exchange represent the sum
of all Wall Street’s knowledge of the past, immediate and remote, applied to the dis-
counting of the future. (Hamilton, 1922, p 40)
The market is not saying what the condition of business is today. It is saying what
that condition will be months ahead. (Hamilton, 1922, p 42)
The stock barometer [the Dow-Jones averages] is taking every conceivable thing into
account, including that most fluid, inconsistent, and incalculable element, human ptg
nature itself. We cannot, therefore, expect the mechanical exactness of physical sci-
ence. (Hamilton, 1922, p 152)
Let us keep in mind that Dow Theory is not a system devised for beating the specu-
lative game, an infallible method of playing the market. The averages, indeed, must
be read with a single heart. They become deceptive if and when the wish is father to
the thought. We have all heard that when the neophyte meddles with the magician’s
wand, he is apt to raise the devil. (Hamilton, 1922, p 133)
These three hypotheses are very similar to those of technical analysis today. They show
how prescient Dow was and how universal and persistent his theories have been. As markets have
become more efficient, there is some question about how much manipulation can and has
occurred. Recent untruths by major corporations concerning their earnings have shown that the
desire to manipulate still exists. Dow’s tenet, however, stated that the primary direction of stock
prices could not be manipulated and, therefore, should be the primary focus of all serious
investors.
The concept that prices discount everything, including expectations, to the point that they
are predictive of events is the most revolutionary of Dow’s hypotheses. Until then, most investors
looked at individual stock prices and studied what was available about individual companies.
Dow believed that the averages of stocks foretold the shape of industry and were, thus, valuable
in understanding the health of the economy.
Dow was under no illusion that he had found the magic formula for profit, nor were Hamil-
ton or Rhea. Nevertheless, they did believe that by careful and unbiased study of the market aver-
ages, they could interpret, in general terms, the likelihood of the markets continuing or reversing

in direction and thereby could anticipate similar turns in the economy. Their emphasis on study
and lack of emotional reaction is still important today. Ignoring this point is one of the most
widespread causes for investor failure.
DOW THEORY THEOREMS
One of the theorems of Dow Theory is that the ideal market picture consists of an uptrend, top,
downtrend, and bottom, interspersed with retracements and consolidations. Figure 6.1 shows
what this ideal market picture would look like. This market picture, of course, is never seen in its
ideal form. Consider Hamilton’s quote, “A normal market is the kind that never really happens”
(Hamilton, May 4, 1911). The purpose of the ideal market picture is to provide a generalized
model of the stock market’s price behavior over time. It is very simple and resembles a harmonic
without a constant period or amplitude.

FIGURE 6.1 The Dow Theory ideal market picture
From the modern standpoint of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH), this ideal picture
is interesting because it presumes that prices oscillate over long periods based on the accumu-
lated emotion of investors as well as the facts of the business cycle. Were market prices to dupli-
cate the business cycle precisely, prices would not oscillate as widely as they do nor lead the
business cycle by as much as they do. Indeed, some theorists argue that the markets actually
cause the business cycle, that confidence or lack of confidence from the markets translates into
buying and selling of products (Szala and Holter, 2004). However, for Dow Theory, the picture
of the ideal market remains the same regardless of cause.
A second theorem of Dow Theory is that economic rationale should be used to explain
stock market action. Remember that Dow created both an industrial average and a railroad aver-
age. Although we have no record of Dow’s precise reasoning for doing so, Rhea posited that
Dow believed that industrial stocks represented the trend of industry profits and prospects and
that railroad stocks represented railroads’ profits and prospects. The profits and prospects for
both of these sectors must be in accord with each other. For example, industry may be producing
goods, but if railroads are not shipping these goods, then industry must slow down. Goods pro-
duced must be shipped to the customer. Railroads must confirm that produced goods are being
sold and delivered. Today, of course, the railroad average has been changed to the transportation

average to represent airlines, truckers, and other means of shipping goods. Nevertheless, the eco-
nomic rationale of goods produced and transported is still valid in the industrial sector of the
economy. Where Dow’s economic rationale differs from the present is in the service and technol-
ogy sectors that have become larger in dollar volume than the industrial sector. Some analysts
use representations of these newer sectors to form an economic rationale for stock market action.
A third theorem of Dow Theory is that prices trend. A trend is defined as the general direc-
tion in which something tends to move. Because we are talking about markets, that “something”
is price.
BOX 6.2 SOME OF WILLIAM HAMILTON’S THOUGHTS ON TRENDS
…on the well-tested rule of reading the averages, a major bull swing continues so
long as the rally from a secondary reaction establishes new high points in both aver-
ages…. (Hamilton, December 30, 1921)
An indication [of price trend] remains in force until it is cancelled by another….
(Hamilton, September 23, 1929)
ptg
As we saw in Chapter 2, “The Basic Principle of Technical Analysis—The Trend,” the con-
cept that prices trend is one of the fundamental assumptions of technical analysis. It is the reason
why technical analysts can profit. A trend is the basic pattern of all prices. A trend can be
upward, downward, or sideways. Obviously, a sideways trend is more difficult to profit from than
an upward or downward trend. Technical analysts endeavor to forecast the direction of the mar-
ket trend. Because trends are the central principle in technical analysis, Chapters 12, “Trends—
The Basics,” and 14, “Moving Averages,” focus on how trends are defined, measured, and
analyzed by modern-day technical analysts. Right now, we focus on the notion of trend within
the Dow Theory.
Dow Theory posited that there are three basic trends in price motion, each defined by time:
There are three movements of the averages, all of which may be in progress at one
and the same time. The first, and most important, is the primary trend: the broad
upward or downward movements known as bull or bear markets, which may be of
several years duration. The second, and most deceptive movement, is the secondary
reaction: an important decline in a primary bull market or a rally in a primary bear
market. These reactions usually last from three weeks to as many months. The third,
and usually unimportant, movement is the daily fluctuation. (Rhea, 1932)
Figure 6.2 shows graphically how these three trends are interrelated. Let us look at each of
these three types of trends—the primary, secondary, and minor—a bit more closely.

FIGURE 6.2 Dow Theory three trend types (Weekly: May 2002–May 2005)
The Primary Trend
Correct determination of the primary movement (or trend) is the most important fac-
tor in successful speculation. There is no known method of forecasting the extent or
duration of a primary movement. (Rhea, 1932)
The primary trend is the longest of the three trend types. It represents the overall, broad, long-
term movement of security prices. The duration of this long-term trend can be several years. The
primary trend may be an upward trend, which is known as a primary bull trend, or it may be a
downward trend, referred to as a primary “bear” trend. The general long-run upward trend in Fig-
ure 6.2 indicates a primary “bull” trend.
Primary bull markets are characterized by three separate phases: The first represents reviv-
ing confidence from the prior primary bear market; the second phase represents the response to
increased corporate earnings; and the third is when speculation becomes dominant and prices
rise on “hopes and expectations.”
Primary bear markets are long downward price movements, interrupted by occasional ral-
lies, that continue until prices have discounted the worst that is apt to occur. They, too, are char-
acterized by three separate phases: first, abandonment of hopes upon which stocks were

Chapter 6 Dow Theory 81
purchased; second, selling due to decreased earnings; and third, distress selling, regardless of
value, by those who believe the worst is yet to come or who are forced to liquidate.
The Secondary Trend
…a secondary reaction is considered to be an important decline in a bull market or
advance in a bear market, usually lasting from three weeks to as many months, dur-
ing which intervals the price movement generally retraces from 33 percent to 66 per-
cent of the primary price change since the termination of the last preceding
secondary reaction. (Rhea, 1932)
The secondary trend is an intermediate-term trend that runs counter to the primary trend. For
example, during a several-year primary uptrend, prices may fall for a few weeks or a few months.
During this secondary trend market decline, prices fall often, erasing 33% to 66% of the gain that
has occurred since the completion of the previous secondary uptrend. Points A to B in Figure 6.2
represent a secondary downtrend.
Being able to anticipate or recognize secondary reactions increases profit capabilities by
taking advantage of smaller market swings, but Dow believed this exercise was too dangerous. ptg
Because the primary trend and secondary trend reversal have similar characteristics, secondary
reactions are often initially assumed as changes in primary trends or are mistakenly thought to be
only reactions when the primary trend is changing.
The Minor Trend
Inferences drawn from one day’s movement of the averages are almost certain to be
misleading and are of but little value except when “lines” are being formed. The day
to day movement must be recorded and studied, however, because a series of charted
daily movements always eventually develops into a pattern easily recognized as hav-
ing a forecasting value. (Rhea, 1932)
A line is two to three weeks of horizontal price movement in an average within a 5%
range. It is usually a sign of accumulation or distribution, and a breakout above or
below the range high or low respectively suggests a movement to continue in the
same direction as the breakout. Movement from one average unconfirmed by the
other average is generally not sustained. (Rhea, 1932)
The portion of the Dow Theory which pertains to “lines” has proved to be so depend-
able as almost to deserve the designation of axiom instead of theorem. (Hamilton,
September 23, 1929)
The stock market is not logical in its movements from day to day. (Hamilton, 1929)

82 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Dow, Hamilton, and Rhea would likely be horrified at today’s preoccupation with minute-to-
minute “day trading” and would likely consider such activity too risky. (Based on the percentage
of day traders who currently fail, they would be right.) Their observation essentially states that
prices become more random and unpredictable as the time horizon shrinks. This is certainly true
today as well and is one reason why, as during Dow’s, Hamilton’s, and Rhea’s time, investors
today should concentrate on longer-term time horizons and avoid the tempting traps in short-
term trading.
Concept of Confirmation
Dow always ignored a movement of one average which was not confirmed by the
other, and experience since his death has shown the wisdom of that method of check-
ing the reading of the averages. His theory was that a downward movement of sec-
ondary, and perhaps ultimately primary importance, was established when the new
lows for both averages were under the low points of the preceding reaction. (Hamil-
ton, June 25, 1928)
In line with the economic rationale for the use of the industrial and railroad averages as proxies ptg
for the economy and state of business, Dow Theory introduced a concept that also is important
today, namely the concept of confirmation. Confirmation has taken new directions, which this
book covers later, but in Rhea’s time, confirmation was the consideration of the industrial and
railroad averages together. “Conclusions based upon the movement of one average, unconfirmed
by the other, are almost certain to prove misleading” (Rhea, 1932).
Confirmation in the Dow Theory comes when both the industrial and railroad averages
reach new highs or new lows together on a daily closing basis. These new levels do not necessar-
ily have to be reached at exactly the same time, but for a primary reversal, it is necessary that
each average reverses direction and reaches new levels before the primary reversal can be recog-
nized (see Figure 6.3). Confirmation, therefore, is the necessary means for recognizing in what
direction the primary trend is headed. Failure to reach new levels during a secondary reaction is
a warning that the primary trend may be reversing. For example, when there is a primary bull
market, the failure of the averages to reach new highs during a secondary advance alerts the ana-
lyst that the primary trend may be reversing to a bear market. In addition, if lower levels are
reached during the secondary bear trend, it is an indication that the primary trend has changed
from an upward bull trend to a downward bear trend. Thus, more extreme levels occurring dur-
ing a secondary retracement in the opposite direction of the primary trend are evidence that the
primary trend has changed direction. When confirmed by the other average, the technical analyst
then has proof that the primary trend has reversed and can act accordingly.

FIGURE 6.3 Dow Theory of “confirmation”
Today, because the makeup of the economy is so different than in Dow’s and Hamilton’s
time, with the advent of a wider base of industrial stocks and technology stocks, the usual
method of confirming a primary trend is to use confirmation between the two indexes: Standard
& Poor’s 500 and the Russell 2000. The economic rationale is that the Standard & Poor’s 500
represents the largest, most highly capitalized companies in the United States, and the Russell
2000 represents smaller companies with higher growth and usually a technological base. When
these two indexes confirm each other, the primary trend is confirmed. Figure 6.4 shows the more
modern application of Dow’s theory of confirmation.
Importance of Volume
Various meanings are ascribed to reductions in the volume of trading. One of the
platitudes most constantly quoted in Wall Street is to the effect that one should never
sell a dull market short. That advice is probably right oftener than it is wrong, but it
is always wrong in an extended bear swing. In such a swing… the tendency is to
become dull on rallies and active on declines. (Hamilton, May 21, 1909), as quoted
in Rhea, 1932)

2002–September 2005)
Although volume of transactions cannot signal a trend reversal, it is important as a secondary
confirmation of trend. Excessively high market prices that are accompanied by less volume on
rallies and more activity on declines usually suggest an overbought market (see Figure 6.5). Con-
versely, extremely low prices with dull declines and increased volume on rallies suggest an over-
sold market. “Bull markets terminate in a period of excessive activity and begin with
comparatively light transactions” (Rhea, 1932).
The originators of Dow Theory were quick, however, not to overstate the importance of
volume. Although volume was considered, it was not a primary consideration. Price trend and
confirmation overrode any consideration of volume.
The volume is much less significant than is generally supposed. It is purely relative,
and what would be a large volume in one state of the market supply might well be
negligible in a greatly active market. (Hamilton, 1922, p. 177)

CRITICISMS OF THE DOW THEORY
Although Dow Theory forms the building blocks for modern-day technical analysis, this theory
is not without criticisms. One of the criticisms is that following the theory will result in an
investor acting after rather than before or at market tops and bottoms. With Dow Theory, there is
an inevitable lag between the actual turn in the primary trend and the recognition of the change
in trend. The theory does not recognize a turn until long after it has occurred and has been con-
firmed.
On the other hand, the theory, if properly interpreted, will recognize that primary trend
change and will, thus, never allow a large loss. Dow’s contention was that concentrating on any
direction change of shorter duration than the primary trend increased the chances of having one’s
portfolio whittled away by high turnover, many errors in judgment, and increased transaction
costs. Therefore, Dow Theory is biased toward late recognition of a change in trend to minimize
the costs of wrongly identifying a change in trend.
A second criticism of Dow Theory is that the different trends are not strictly defined. Often
the interpretation of price swings is difficult to assign to a specific trend type. Secondary trend
beginnings often appear like primary trend beginnings, for example. This makes the determina-
tion of the primary trend unclear at times and can incite investment in the wrong direction.
Others, however, criticize Dow Theory for being too specific about the requirements
needed to identify a change in trend. Requiring that only closing prices be used or that any break
to a new level no matter how small is significant often places too much emphasis on a small
change in price.

SUMMARY OF DOW’S WISDOM
…the Dow-Jones averages… have a discretion not shared by all prophets. They are
not talking all the time. (Hamilton, December 17, 1925)
CONCLUSION
Even though Charles Dow never formalized the Dow Theory, his work has formed the basis for
modern-day technical analysis. Despite the many changes that have occurred in the securities
markets over the past century, much of Dow’s basic work and ideas remain pertinent today.
Though Dow might be surprised at the analysis that more advanced tools and computer power
allow, his classic work provides the basic theory that these contemporary models build upon.
Although the specific economic relationships that were valid in Dow’s lifetime, such as the rela-
tionship between industrial stocks and railroad stocks, may need to be altered to represent
ptg
today’s economy, basic economic relationships such as these are still fundamental to market
activity. Despite the fact that today’s technical analyst can build sophisticated, complex mathe-
matical models and run complicated computer tests of trading strategies, it is important to
remember that a thorough grounding in the basics of market activity is necessary for any trading
philosophy to stand the test of time and remain profitable.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. What were the three hypotheses of Dow Theory presented by Rhea? How is each of these
hypotheses relevant for the modern investor?
2. Describe what the Dow Theory ideal market pattern of an uptrend, top, downtrend, and
bottom looks like.
3. Why did Dow think there was an important economic relationship between the stocks of
industrial companies and the stocks of railroads? How do you think this general relation-
ship between economic activity and sectors of the economy might be seen and measured in
today’s economy?
4. What are the three major trends in Dow Theory? Which is the most important? Why?
5. Dow Theory teaches that, while the investor is foregoing potential profit, the investor
should avoid trying to make money by attempting to predict the secondary trend. Why did
Dow and his followers think that trading with the secondary trend was too risky?

ENTIMENT
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you should
• Understand what the term sentiment means ptg
• Understand the concept of contrary opinion
• Be familiar with methods for measuring sentiment of uninformed and informed market
players
As a general rule, it is foolish to do just what other people are doing, because there
are almost sure to be too many people doing the same thing. (William Stanley Jevons
[1835–1882], as quoted in Neill, 1997, p 13)
The focus of this chapter is market sentiment. Market sentiment refers to the psychology or
emotions of market participants. At times, investors are acting on feelings of fear and pessimism.
At other times, hope, overconfidence, and greed characterize investor psychology. Investors
react emotionally to the market, and these reactions affect the market. Thus, investor psychology
is both influenced by and an influencer of market activity.
From a simplistic standpoint, consider a bull market in which stock prices have been
advancing. Investors see their portfolio values increasing. Those who have been sitting on the
sidelines hear how their friends have made money in the stock market. Not wanting to miss out
on these returns, they join in. The average investor is hopeful and confident that the trend of ris-
ing stock prices will continue. Of course, as these investors place more and more money in the
market, stock prices do rise; in economic jargon: As the quantity of investors in the marketplace
increases, the demand for stocks increases, driving stock prices higher. The optimistic view of
the market participants drives prices even higher. Seeing that they were correct, investors eventu-
ally become overconfident and greedy, and purchase even more stocks irrespective of “value.” At
the peak of optimism, investors have placed most of their available money in the stock market. At

this point, there are dwindling amounts of money available to fuel the demand that has been driv-
ing price upward. There is no more fuel to keep stock prices rising, and the stock market reaches
a peak.
Conversely, when investors are pessimistic and fearful, they begin to sell stock. As the
level of pessimism rises in the market and more investors sell, stock prices fall. These falling
prices lead more and more investors to feel fearful and to sell their shares. When investors are the
most pessimistic and fearful, they have withdrawn much of their money from the market. The
downward trend exacerbated by investors leaving the market ends, and the market reaches a bot-
tom.
WHAT IS SENTIMENT?
Sentiment is defined as the net amount of any group of market players’ optimism or pessimism
reflected in any asset or market price at a particular time. When a stock or commodity is trading
at a price considerably above or below its intrinsic value, something we will not know until con-
siderably later, the difference or deviation from that value often will be accounted for by senti-
ment. It is the collective emotion and other intangible factors that come from the human
ptg
interaction involved in determining a price over or under the supposed value. It is the subject of
study by behavioral finance departments, which are interested in the ways that human cognitive
bias and brain activity affect financial decisions, and it is a staple in technical analysis, for tech-
nical analysts have long held that prices are a combination of fact and emotion. When emotion
becomes excessive and prices thereby deviate substantially from the norm, a price reversal is
usually due, a reversion at least to the mean and sometimes beyond. It is, thus, important for the
technical analyst to know when prices are reflecting emotional extremes.
BOX 7.1 THE THEORY OF CONTRARIAN INVESTING
Whenever nonprofessional investors become “significantly” one-sided in their
expectations about the future course of stock prices, the market will move in the
direction opposite to that which is anticipated by the masses.
Suppose the overwhelming numbers of investors (call them “nonprofessionals”)
become rampantly bullish on the market. The logical extension of highly bullish
expectations results in the purchase of stocks right up to the respective financial lim-
its of the masses. At the very moment when the masses become most bullish, they
will be very nearly fully invested! They won’t have the financial capacity to do more
buying. Who then is left to create demand? Certainly not the minority of investors
we call professionals. It is that group which recognizes over-valuations and presum-
ably has been the supplier of stock to the nonprofessionals during the time that both
prices and the optimism of the masses were rising.

Chapter 7 Sentiment 91
Thus, when the crowd has become extraordinarily bullish, a dearth of demand
exists. The nonprofessionals are loaded with stocks and are cash-poor, while the pro-
fessionals are liquid, but in no frame to buy. Demand is saturated, and even minor
increases in supply will cause stock prices to tumble. At this point, prices are a
strong bet to go (nowhere) but down. (Marty Zweig in the foreword to Ned Davis’
The Triumph of Contrarian Investing, McGraw-Hill, New York, 2004.)
MARKET PLAYERS AND SENTIMENT
The appropriate corresponding timing strategy is to follow informed trader senti-
ment, act against positive feedback trader sentiment, and ignore liquidity trader sen-
timent. (Wang, 2000)
Remember from Chapter 5, “An Overview of Markets,” that there are three types of players in
ptg
any market: the informed, the uninformed, and the liquidity players. The estate that needed to
sell stock to raise cash in the discussion of market players in Chapter 5 was an example of a liq-
uidity player. Liquidity players have only a cursory interest in the markets and do not have an
important role in determining price trends. They affect the market minimally. On the other hand,
informed and uninformed players are the market. Because the interactions between the informed
and uninformed players determine prices, we will focus our discussion on those two groups.
The uninformed players are those participants who, being ruled by their emotions and
biases, act irrationally. They tend to be optimistic after a market rise and buy, thus creating mar-
ket peaks, and to be pessimistic during a market decline and sell, thus creating market bottoms.
Though the uninformed players are often called the “public,” even professionals can be part of
this group. It is not simply the profession or career standing of a market player that classifies an
individual as an informed or uninformed player, it is the timing of the player’s optimistic buying
and pessimistic selling relative to market highs and lows. Research has found that even profes-
sionals such as mutual fund managers, Wall Street strategists, and investment-advisory newslet-
ter writers often behave as uninformed participants. In other words, the majority of market
players are uninformed players.
The informed market players tend to act in a way that is contrary to the majority. That is,
the informed market participants tend to sell at the top, when the majority is optimistic, and buy
at the bottom, when the majority is fearful and selling. Just as uninformed players need not be
amateurs, informed players need not be professionals. They can be corporate insiders or day
traders sitting in their dens in the Caribbean.
By and large, the uninformed players have considerably more money than the informed
players. While day to day the informed players stabilize the markets by spotting and acting upon
small anomalies in prices or as contrarian investors invest in undervalued assets, over longer
periods, the uninformed tend to overwhelm the price action with their positive feedback, in many
instances, forcing the informed to ride with the trend of emotion.

92 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Because maximum optimism and pessimism tend to occur at market price extremes, and
because this emotional background is principally the provenance of the uninformed player, if the
technical analyst can determine how each group is acting, some knowledge of the future direc-
tion of prices can be gained. Presumably, the informed professional will act correctly, and the
uninformed public will act incorrectly, especially at emotional extremes. If we know that a
majority of those participating in the market are extremely optimistic about stock prices contin-
uing on an upward trend, we can conclude that these investors are near fully invested in the mar-
ket and that stock prices are close to a peak. The sentiment indicators that we discuss in this
chapter are designed to measure the extent of investor optimism or pessimism. By using senti-
ment indicators, the technical analyst is attempting to separate the opinions and actions of the
informed players from the uninformed players. The analyst wants to make investment decisions
contrary to those that the uninformed group is making and wants to mimic the actions of the
informed players.
BOX 7.2 NEUROCHEMISTRY AFFECT ON HUMAN THINKING
Neurotransmitters affect emotion and behavior. At present there have been discov-
ered over 108 different neurotransmitters that interact, stimulating and inhibiting the ptg
activities of each other. “Five of these neurotransmitters act throughout most of the
brain: Histamine, serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and
acetylcholine.” (Peterson, 2007 [Inside the Investor’s Brain: The Power of Mind
Over Money], p. 48) “Additionally, local actions of opiods, norepineprhine, stress
hormones, and omega-3 fatty acids affect behavior and decision making. And if that
weren’t enough, common medications, street drugs, and foods also should be con-
sidered for the neural effects on judgment.” (Peterson, p. 50)
“Many pathological mood states (such as depression, mania, anxiety, and obses-
sion), neurological conditions (such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease), and impulse-control disorders (such as kleptomania, compulsive shopping,
and pathological gambling) are known to affect financial decision making: depres-
sion is associated with risk aversion, mania with investing overconfidence, anxiety
with “analysis paralysis,” and compulsions with overtrading. Interestingly, the finan-
cial symptoms of these illnesses can be reduced by medications.” (Peterson, p. 47)
HOW DOES HUMAN BIAS AFFECT DECISION MAKING?
Remember, the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) suggests that enough investors are acting
rationally at any particular point in time to make it impossible for a technical analyst to profit
from security mispricing due to the emotions of the uninformed players. However, the field of
behavioral finance has defined numerous ways in which investors act less than rational. These
biases are common not just to the occasional investor or uninformed public but to professionals
as well. Just look at how many professional securities analysts were caught in the late 1990s

stock market euphoria. These were not stupid, irrational people, but their inherent biases, those
common to all humans, overcame their ability to reason, and they became caught up in the opti-
mism of the time, to tragic effect.
BOX 7.3 INVESTORS ARE THEIR OWN WORST ENEMIES
From Zweig (2007)
• Everyone knows that you should buy low and sell high—and yet, all too
often, we buy high and sell low.
• Everyone knows that beating the market is nearly impossible—but just about
everyone thinks he can do it.
• Everyone knows that panic selling is a bad idea—but a company that
announces it earned 23 cents per share instead of 24 cents per share can lose $5
billion of market value in a minute-and-a-half.
• Everyone knows that Wall Street strategists can’t predict what the market is
about to do—but investors still hang on every word from the financial pundits ptg
who prognosticate on TV.
• Everyone knows that chasing hot stocks or mutual funds is a sure way to get
burned—yet millions of investors flock back to the flame every year. Many do
so though they swore, just a year or two before, never to get burned again.
…our brains often drive us to do things that make no logical sense—but make
perfect emotional sense.
Those who study behavioral finance attribute some of the biased behavior of financial mar-
ket players to crowd behavior. These researchers have found that crowd opinions are formed by
several biases. People tend to conform to their group, making the taking of an opposite opinion
sometimes difficult and dangerous. People do not like rejection or ridicule and will stay quiet to
avoid such pressure. People often meet hostility when going against a crowd. Another bias is that
people gain confidence by extrapolating past trends, even when doing so is irrational, and, thus,
they tend to switch their opinions slowly. Also, people feel secure in accepting the opinions of
others, especially “experts,” and tend to believe the establishment will take care of them.
Understanding that investor emotion and bias affect investment decisions is important for
two reasons. First, understanding the links between emotions, investment behavior, and security
prices can help the technical analyst profit by spotting market extremes. Second, technical ana-
lysts must remember that they are subject to the same human biases as other investors. This set of
human biases is so strong that even those who recognize them still are affected by them and must
constantly fight against them. Successful traders and investors often say that the worst enemy in
investment is oneself. Technical analysts hope to profit from understanding how human bias can
cause people to pay prices greater than the intrinsic value for a stock, but if they are not careful,
their own biases may cause them to do the same.

94 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
For example, the behavioral finance principle of “representation” suggests that people
often recognize patterns where they do not actually exist. Although it is the technical analyst’s
strategy to attempt to recognize patterns, an analyst must be certain not to “see” patterns that do
not really exist. Therefore, an investor or trader must not only understand our human foibles but
must also find a way to either fight against them or avoid them.
At times, emotional excess leads to extraordinary rises in prices (and sometimes to extraor-
dinary declines, called crashes or panics). These periods of extraordinary price increases,
whether in the stock market, gold, or tulip bulbs, are called bubbles. During a bubble, stock mar-
ket returns are much higher than the mean, or average, return. Bubbles are part of that fat tail
mentioned in the discussion of the nonrandomness of prices in Chapter 4, “The Technical Analy-
sis Controversy.” Although bubbles occur infrequently, they occur considerably more often than
would be expected under an ideal random walk model.
For the current discussion, the existence of bubbles is proof that prices are not always deter-
mined rationally; emotion can get hold of the market and, through positive feedback, run prices far
beyond any reasonable value before reversing. This type of bubble is visible in Figure 7.1. During
the late 1990s, security prices were rapidly increasing. By 2000, security prices were extremely high,
especially in the technology sector. The price earnings ratios for many companies were at record
highs. For some companies, the price earnings ratios were infinite because there were no earnings at
all. In fact, investors would have to assume that earnings would grow at an astounding 100% per year ptg
for 20 years to justify the stock prices using traditional stock valuation models. According to invest-
ment analyst David Dreman, “This seems to be a classic pattern of investor overreaction” (Dreman,
2002, p. 4). Nevertheless, the bubble occurred, indicating that investors of all kinds can become blind
to reality when greed and other psychological biases influence decision making.

CROWD BEHAVIOR AND THE CONCEPT OF CONTRARY OPINION
The art of contrary thinking may be stated simply: Thrust your thoughts out of a rut.
In a word, be a nonconformist when using your mind.
Sameness of thinking is a natural attribute. So you must expect to practice a little to
get into the habit of throwing your mind into directions that are opposite to the obvi-
ous.
Obvious thinking—or thinking the same way in which everyone else is thinking—
commonly leads to wrong judgments and wrong conclusions.
Let me give you an easily remembered epigram to sum up this thought:
When everyone thinks alike, everyone is likely to be wrong. (Neill, 1997, p. 1)

96 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
When individuals think by themselves, they can be very logical and reasonable, but when joined
with a crowd, they tend to let certain cognitive biases affect their decision making. History is
replete with examples of financial manias, those periods when, in retrospect, the crowd of
investors became overly irrational. During those periods, the irrationality is met with a new hys-
teria, the belief that “things are different this time.” We have seen this emotional excess just
recently in the Internet stock-price bubble in the late 1990s and in the real estate bubble in the
early 2000s. At those times, it was very difficult to argue, much less invest, against the prevailing
trend of emotion. Too many were making too much money regardless of their reasoning. Of
course, such times eventually reverse and return to normal and often decline to an opposite
excess. Not believing that they are personally caught in a mania, when prices reverse, people
blame others for their own irrationality. Denying their own responsibility for being duped by the
emotions of the crowd, they demand new laws be passed to prevent “evil” corporations or gov-
ernment laxity or fads as derivatives from causing another bubble. Such behavior is not limited to
financial markets. Manias occur in politics, religion, philosophy, education—almost every
human endeavor. They are often man-made, as in either the Tulip Bulb mania or as in politics
through propaganda and “spin.” The Theory of Contrary Opinion is an attempt to teach individ-
uals how to recognize and profit from such excesses in emotional fervor and to look at all sides
of a belief before committing to it or rejecting it.
ptg
A “crowd” thinks with its heart (that is, is influenced by emotions) while an individ-
ual thinks with his brain. (Neill, 1997, p. 3)
Contrary opinion is a “way of thinking…It is more of an antidote to general forecasting
than a system for forecasting. In a few words, it is a thinking tool, not a crystal ball” (Neill, 1997,
p. 9). To be a contrarian, an investor must sell (be pessimistic) when the overall market mood is
grossly optimistic and buy (be optimistic) when most investors are pessimistic and in a panic.
Although this might sound easy enough, the problem with implementing a contrarian strategy is
that it is indefinite. Remember that one of the basic tenets of Dow Theory is that prices trend.
When prices are trending upward, we want to be in a long position, riding the trend. The goal of
understanding sentiment is to discern when that trend is losing energy and will reverse. There-
fore, the task of the contrarian player is to find a way in which to quantify which direction the
majority of market players is headed and to question whether there is enough remaining energy
to keep the market moving in that direction. Remember that so long as players still have money
to invest in the market, their optimism will drive prices higher. It is only when players are fully
invested that their optimism will not be accompanied by security purchases. At this point, the
market is at an excess, and the trend often ends. To quantify these excesses, the technical analyst
uses publicly available data to construct indicators of emotional excess. Now that we have
looked at some of the theoretical underpinnings, let us look at how these sentiment indicators are
typically constructed and evaluated.
HOW IS SENTIMENT OF UNINFORMED PLAYERS MEASURED?
A top in the market is the point of maximum optimism, and a bottom in the market is
the point of maximum pessimism. (Davis, 2003, p. 9)

Chapter 7 Sentiment 97
Sentiment indicators are data series that give the technical analyst some feeling for how much
prices are at an excessively emotional level. With that information, potential future reversals in
trend can be better anticipated. Generally, sentiment indicators are more useful in analyzing mar-
kets than individual issues. Individual issue prices have their emotional component, of course,
but ways to measure that component are much less reliable than those of measuring overall mar-
ket sentiment. Therefore, we focus our discussion on indicators that reflect overall market opti-
mism.
Remember, we are interested in the two broad categories of players—the uninformed and
the informed. Most sentiment indicators focus on the uninformed. These uninformed players are
usually wrong at major market turns. Therefore, if we know what the uninformed are doing, we
have a clue about what not to do. On the other hand, some sentiment indicators attempt to meas-
ure the action of informed players, who generally are accurate in their assessment of market
prospects. These indicators are based on watching professional traders and corporate insiders
and following their lead.
Fear and greed are not mirror images of one another. Emotional excess is often the sharpest
at market bottoms when panic has occurred. On the other hand, optimism can last for a long
while. Most sentiment indicators are, therefore, useful in determining market bottoms when the
fear reaches its highest level. These indicators can often be deceiving on the rise in prices, how-
ever, because the extreme in greed, the converse of fear in markets, will place them at high levels ptg
during which the market will continue to rise. A sell signal generated by a specific sentiment
indicator is, thus, less likely to be as valid as a buy signal.
Sentiment Indicators Based on Options and Volatility
To glean some information about what uninformed traders are doing, analysts often consider
option trading activity and volatility measures. Option trading can be a sign of market specula-
tion, and volatility can be an indication of the anxiousness of market players. Let’s look at some
of these measures.
Option Trading and Sentiment
Traditionally, odd lot statistics were reliable indicators of the sentiment of uninformed, small
investors. That small investors, who did not have enough capital to purchase round, 100-share
lots, were heavily buying stocks was an indication that the uninformed public was overly opti-
mistic. When small, uninformed investors were highly pessimistic, they would short sell odd
lots. The odd lot figures represented a measure of uninformed, public speculation, which tended
to be highest at market turning points.
Today, listed options data has replaced the old odd-lot figures as one of the best measures
of public speculation. A call option is an option to buy an asset, usually a stock or commodity, at
a fixed price for a specific period. A put option is an option to sell an asset at a fixed price for a
specific period of time. Some options, by expanding on the basics of time and price, can become
very complex. However, the standard call and put option is the most widely traded and has the
highest volume of any option type. The option market, by its very nature, is a speculative market.

98 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
It depends on leverage for maximum gains, and positions can close worthless on the expiration
of options. As such, it has become a speculative vehicle for the uninformed public.
Let us look at how the options market can measure sentiment. Let us assume that Jerry
thinks that the price of stock XYZ will increase above its current level of $20 per share. Jerry can
purchase a call option in which he has the option to buy 100 shares of XYZ at a price of $20 per
share anytime in the next three months. The option price and premium—say, $2 per share—is
much less than the outright purchase price of the stock. If the price of XYZ rises above $20, Jerry
can exercise his option and purchase shares at the guaranteed, and now very favorable, $20. If
instead, the price of XYZ declines or remains flat during the three-month period, Jerry will allow
the option to expire and he will lose his investment. Thus, the option market gives Jerry, an unin-
formed player, a way to speculate about the movement of the price of a stock by paying a small
fee for the option. When investors think that stock prices will rise, they speculate by purchasing
call options. When investors are bearish, they speculate by purchasing put options. When
investors are very bullish, they buy out-of-the-money call options—those that have a striking
price above the current stock price—because they trade at very low prices.
Owners will exercise their call options when they correctly project price increases and
their put options when they correctly anticipate price decreases. When investors incorrectly pre-
dict market moves, exercising their options is unprofitable. If the owner of an option does not
exercise the option by the expiration date, then the option expires worthless.1 ptg
Because the purchase of a call represents one who believes the stock market will rise and a
put reflects a bearish opinion, the ratio of calls to puts represents the relative demand for options
by speculators and, thus, is a hint as to their disposition toward the market. The more call buyers
relative to put buyers, the more optimistic are the speculators.
Using Put/Call Ratios to Gauge Sentiment
There are several ways to calculate a ratio between puts and calls. Some have used a ratio of the
average premium paid for calls versus the average premium paid for puts. In theory, the premium
represents the anxiousness of the option buyer and the reticence of the option seller. Statistically,
however, this has not been reliable for indicating sentiment. Some analysts have added the price
of all options traded each day multiplied by the volume of each trade to arrive at a dollar volume
ratio between calls and puts. Not only does this calculation require accurate data and significant
computing power, but the information provided by this calculation also has not seemed to be par-
ticularly useful. Others have calculated a ratio based on the open interest in calls and puts. Unfor-
tunately, this has also turned out to be a mediocre indicator of contrary opinion.
1. It has long been thought that most options expire worthless, indicating that most people purchasing options have incor-
rectly predicted the direction of market moves. However, recent research indicates that more are exercised than had been
thought. In the November 2004 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities, Tom Gentile reports on a study
of 30 years of option data conducted by Alex Johnson of the International Securities Exchange who found that only 30%
of options expire worthless. Roughly 10% are exercised, and the remaining 60% are closed through offsetting transac-
tions. The percentage expiring worthless, nevertheless, is large and still suggests that many option buyers are unin-
formed.

Chapter 7 Sentiment 99
The final, simplest, and most consistent method of calculating puts to calls is to calculate a
ratio of the total volume of puts traded in a day versus the total volume of calls (McMillan,
1996). For the stock market, the raw volume statistics as well as the ratio are available in
Microsoft Excel format on the Web site of the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(www.cboe.com), known as the CBOE, the largest options exchange in the world according to
the Futures Industry Association. One unique way of measuring option-player sentiment is the
International Securities Exchange (ISE) Sentiment Index. The ISE (www.ise.com) is the largest
electronic options exchange in the United States, and offers trading in over 2,000 equity, ETF,
index, and foreign exchange products. Their Sentiment Index, based on the idea that investors
will often buy call and put options to express their market view of a stock, uses opening long
position volume only. Because they are not considered representative of true market sentiment
due to their specialized nature, firm trades and market markers are excluded from the calculation.
Option volume ratios have changed over the 35 years that options have been traded in
exchanges. It is, thus, imperative to smooth the raw volume data using moving averages to
reduce the effect of this long-term relationship change. Ned Davis Research, Inc.
(www.ndr.com), using the ISE Sentiment Index, discovered a technique to take advantage of
short-term stock market moves. They calculated a ratio of the 13-day simple moving average to
the 20-day simple moving average of the index. When the ratio rose above 1.02, a buy signal was
generated, and when the ratio declined below 0.98, a sell signal was generated. Figure 7.2 dis- ptg
plays and summarizes the results of these signals. They are high-turnover signals with an average
of 12.5 trades per year.

100 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Ken Tower, CMT, chief market strategist at Quantitative Analysis Services, Inc., uses a
ratio of the 10-day moving average of the put/call volume to the 126-day moving average,
roughly equivalent to a 2-week versus a 26-week moving average. Deviations between these two
averages determine the extremes in option emotion. A high ratio suggests more put buyers than
call buyers, indicating that the uninformed players are pessimistic. Because this ratio is a contrar-
ian indicator, a high put/call ratio is generally favorable for the future market direction. By com-
bining futures premium/cash ratios on the NASDAQ and S&P 500 futures with CBOE put/call
volume, Ned Davis Research, Inc., found another superior method with excellent trade perform-
ance, as shown in Figure 7.3. This combination of contrary opinion indicators produced a 26.6%
gain per annum when favorable and a 17.8% loss when unfavorable. It appears that option vol-
ume and futures premiums are excellent methods of measuring speculator opinion.

Volatility and Sentiment
Another strategy for analyzing the behavior of the uninformed market participants is looking at
volatility. Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a security price oscillates, usually about

Chapter 7 Sentiment 101
its mean, without regard to its trend over a specified period. The most common calculation for
volatility is the standard deviation about the mean. Historical volatility is the standard deviation
of prices in the underlying security about its mean over some past period. The 100-day volatility,
for example, is the amount by which a security oscillated over the past 100 days about its mean.
Volatility is mean reverting. Therefore, when it gets out of alignment with what it has been
on average, we can assume that it will return to its mean. As in security returns, however, this is
not an absolute. Just as there are fat tails in the distribution of price returns, fat tails also occur in
volatility distributions. Another common assumption is that volatility is independent of price
return. In other words, adherents to this assumption claim that the ability to predict the volatility
of a security will not aid in predicting the future price direction or return. Some evidence refutes
this hypothesis. Volatility is often a measure of the anxiousness of the players in the security mar-
ket, increasing as they become nervous and decreasing as they become complacent. Because the
players act as a crowd and are often uninformed, volatility can be a predictive factor in markets.
Let us look at some of the ways to measure volatility.
Using Volatility to Measure Sentiment
VIX is the exchange symbol for a percentage indicator of implied volatility in Standard & Poor’s
500 options. Volatility in the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 100 Index are represented by
ptg
VXN and VXO, respectively. VIX, VXN, and VXO are traded on the CBOE as futures and
options. Instead of measuring historical volatility, these indicators measure what is known as
implied volatility. Historic volatility is past volatility and generally oscillates with past anxious-
ness. By looking at implied volatility, the analyst hopes to measure market participants’ anxious-
ness about the future.
Implied volatility is a figure derived from the Black-Scholes option formula. The Black-
Scholes option-pricing model suggests that the price of an option is a function of the spread
between the underlying security price and the strike price of the option, the time remaining in the
option, the prevailing interest rate, and the volatility of the underlying security. If we know the
price of an option, the option strike price, the price of the underlying security, the interest rate,
and the time remaining in the options, we can calculate the only missing variable—the implied
volatility. Thus, implied volatility is the volatility implied by the option traders in their pricing of
the options in the marketplace. Implied as well as historic volatility correlates to some extent
with market prices. High volatility tends to occur at periods of stress, emotion, uncertainty, fear,
and nervousness, most often peaking at a panic bottom. On the other hand, low volatility seems
to occur during market rises and market peaks when emotions are calm, content, and relaxed. By
looking for extremes in implied volatility then, because implied volatility expresses the expecta-
tions of those option traders, we can determine market emotion. VIX is the most common meas-
ure of implied market volatility, and its predictive ability is demonstrated in Figure 7.4.

FIGURE 7.4 The S&P 500 and VIX (December 1996–July 2010)
Combining Put/Call Ratio and Volatility
One final method of using option data is using the CBOE put/call volume ratio for all stocks and
the VXO, the implied volatility index for the Standard & Poor’s 100 Index, the OEX. By calcu-
lating the ratio of a 10-day moving average to a 65-day moving average for each figure to nor-
malize the data and averaging it by summing the two calculations and dividing by two, Kaeppel
(2004) developed an option sentiment index that signaled intermediate market turns during the
period from January 1997 through February 2003. As with many other indicators, the long, sus-
tained rise into 2000 was partially missed with early sell signals. Option sentiment and other
measures of sentiment tend to work more reliably at bottoms when investors panic than during an
advance when greed develops more slowly.
Polls
One way to measure the sentiment of market participants is simply to ask the players if they are
bearish or bullish. Although this might appear to be the most straightforward way of gathering

Chapter 7 Sentiment 103
information about expectations, sampling problems and other biases associated with poll taking
exist. Despite these biases, poll results, if measured over a constant time interval, can give some
idea of the public mood. Poll results are contrary indicators because they express optimism at
market tops and pessimism at market bottoms. Polls, thus, gather information and measure the
sentiment of uninformed investors. Several different companies collect and publish sentiment
information based on polls. Let us look at a few of these.
Advisory Opinion
Investors Intelligence (www.investorsintelligence.com), a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of
Stockcube Plc, a U.K. company, located in New Rochelle, New York, provides sentiment infor-
mation in its Advisory Service Sentiment survey. Since 1963, the company has read approxi-
mately 120 independent (“not affiliated with brokers or mutual funds”) investment-advisory
newsletters every week and determined the percentage of those that are bullish, bearish, or
expecting a correction. Intuitively, it seems that newsletter writers would be more sophisticated
and, thus, more in tune with the market than the public they advise, but the numbers over the past
40 years instead show a tendency to be incorrect, especially at market extremes. Thus, this sur-
vey provides information about the uninformed players and works as a contrarian indicator.
What they have found is that when the percentage of bearish advisors is greater than 50 and the
ptg
percentage of bullish advisors is less than 25, a buy signal occurs in the general stock market. On
the other hand, when the percentage of bearish advisors declines below 20 and the percentage of
bullish advisors exceeds 55–60, a sell signal occurs. They neglect showing any tests of these lev-
els, and have derived them purely from observation of the statistics over 45+ years.
The profitability of using this information to make trading decisions is questionable. Solt
and Statman (1988) found no statistically significant relation between the sentiment of invest-
ment newsletters and stock returns: The raw numbers and several ways of looking at them have
not proven to be informative in the past. Colby (2003) found no profitable results in the crossing
of advisory data exponential moving averages between 1 and 1,000 weeks.
However, several studies by others have shown that with certain modifications, the advi-
sory sentiment in the past has been a somewhat reliable indicator of future stock market price
action. A standard calculation of advisory sentiment is the ratio of the percentage of bullish advi-
sors to the total of the percentages of bullish and bearish advisors. This is then plotted (see Fig-
ure 7.5) and the signal levels are determined. Ned Davis Research, Inc., used a ten-week simple
moving average of this ratio and determined that a rise above 69% in the ratio resulted in a
loss/year of 0.6%, and a decline below 53% produced a gain/year of 11.5% over the period Sep-
tember 18, 1970 through February 12, 2010. These are credible results.
To improve these results, they added a monetary background component, as displayed in
Figure 7.6. They based the monetary background on a 26-week rate of change in three-year U.S.
Treasury bill yields and Moody’s BAA bond yields from January 1965 through February 12,
2010, and produced a gain/annum of 13.1% versus a buy-and-hold gain of 5.8%.

Chapter 7 Sentiment 105
Colby (2003) also suggests that when a large percentage of advisors are bearish, market
prices will rise. He suggests using advisory sentiment to find these periods of extreme pessimism
by using an optimistically skewed decision rule. In this decision rule, investors take a short posi-
tion whenever the percentage of bearish newsletters is greater than the 54-week exponential
moving average of bears plus ten percentage points. Following this strategy over the 1982–2001
period would have resulted in a net profit of 70.3% over the profits of a buy-and-hold strategy.
American Association of Individual Investors
The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII; www.aaii.com) compiles a daily poll
from its 150,000 members on what they believe the stock market will do over the next six
months. DeBondt (1993) found that the members polled by the AAII tended to forecast as though
they expected a continuation of the past stock returns. Ned Davis Research, Inc., found that over
the July 1987–February 2010 period, when a two-week moving average of the bullish investor
percentage divided by the sum of the bullish and bearish percentages rose above 65.0 (that is, the
AAII investors were too optimistic), the stock market had a tendency to decline 2.8% per annum.
When the ratio declined below 59.5, the stock market had a tendency to rise 9.9% per annum (see
Figure 7.7).

106 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Consensus Bullish Sentiment Index
Consensus, Inc., (www.consensus-inc.com) of Independence, Missouri, draws from a mix of
brokerage house analysts and independent advisory services to compile the Consensus Bullish
Sentiment Index. The data covers a broad spectrum of approaches to the market, including the
fundamental, technical, and cyclical. Consensus, Inc., considers only opinions that have been
publicized.
Market Vane
Market Vane Corporation (www.marketvane.net) of Pasadena, California, polls 100 leading
commodity trading advisors every day for their opinions of the futures markets, principally:
stock indexes, T-bonds, gold, silver, Yen, crude oil, soybeans, live cattle, sugar, and others. This
data is then used to construct the bullish consensus statistics published in Barron’s every week.
The Sentix Sentiment Index
Originated in February 2001, the relatively new Sentix Index (www.sentix.de) is a comprehen-
sive poll of German investors about their opinion of the markets, including the U.S. stock and
bond markets. The poll is taken every week on Friday, and the results are published each Monday
morning in Germany. About 3,100 people (among them more than 690 institutional investors) are ptg
asked about their opinion on 12 different markets: DAX-Index, TecDAX (German technology
stocks), EuroSTOXX 50, S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, Nikkei-Index, Bund-Future, T-Bond-
Future, EUR-USD currency, USD-JPY currency, gold, and oil. The poll includes the investors’
expectations for one month (short-term) and six months (medium-term). Huebner (2008) has
described several uses of the Sentix data for anticipating market direction, and van Daele (2005)
used the Sentix data for his PhD thesis on why “noise traders” act the way they do.
Consumer Confidence Index
The Conference Board (www.conference-board.org), producers of the index of leading eco-
nomic indicators and the help-wanted index, reports on consumer confidence each month. The
Consumer Confidence Index is based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households. The
survey is based on consumer expectations for the U.S. economy. Like most other opinion polls,
the survey has been a contrary indicator to the stock market. As seen in Figure 7.8, Ned Davis
Research, Inc., found that between 1969 and 2010, when the survey number rose above 110,
demonstrating that consumers were overly optimistic, the stock market remained relatively flat
(-0.2% per year). However, when consumers were predominately pessimistic and the survey
number declined to below 66, the stock market rose on average 14.6% per annum.

Other Measures of Contrary Opinion
The poll-based measures of market sentiment that we have just discussed are based upon what
market participants say their market opinions are. Of course, we are not so much interested in
whether market participants say they are optimistic; what were are really interested in is how
much is their level of optimism resulting in buying and security price increases. Now we con-
sider some other measures of contrary opinion that are based upon movement of money within
the markets.
Buying and Selling Climaxes
Investors Intelligence uses the term climax to describe a specific event that occurs over a 1-week
period. A buying climax occurs when a stock makes a new 52-week high but then closes below
the previous week’s close. A selling climax occurs when a stock makes a new 52-week low and
then closes above the previous week’s close. “The reason for such a rigid definition for climaxes

is that this enables us to classify accurately and consistently what is and what isn’t a climax. This
is important as we maintain historic records of the climaxes generated each week and have noted
that important market turning points are often accompanied by a sudden rise in the number of
buying or selling climaxes,” states Investors Intelligence (www.investorsintelligence.com). Fig-
ure 7.9 shows the buying and selling climaxes from March 2009 through the beginning of Febru-
ary 2010. Their work shows that sellers into buying climaxes and buyers into selling climaxes are
correct in direction about 80% of the time after four months.

Mutual Fund Statistics
Because mutual fund investors are mostly from the uninformed public sector, mutual fund statis-
tics can often be useful in determining what the uninformed is thinking and doing. The most reli-
able statistic is the cash reserves in stock mutual funds as a percentage of the assets and adjusted
for interest rates.
Mutual Fund Cash as a Percentage of Assets
It has long been known that mutual fund cash holdings are contrary indicators for the stock mar-
ket. There are many reasons for mutual funds to hold cash, but the bottom line is that high levels
of cash usually occur at stock market bottoms. Jason Goepfert (2004), in his Charles H. Dow
Award paper, building on earlier work by Fosback (1976) and Ned Davis Research, Inc., found
that adjusting mutual fund cash for the interest rate is an even more reliable indicator than the
cash percent position by itself. He found that when mutual fund cash, adjusted for interest rates,

Chapter 7 Sentiment 109
during the period from January 1981 through June 2004, declined to below its lowest threshold,
the stock market rose on average 8.1% over the following year. When the cash level was at its
highest, the stock market declined by an average 6.1% over the following year.
Ned Davis Research, Inc., found essentially the same relationship with mutual fund cash
percentage, adjusted for interest rates, and the stock market (see Figure 7.10). By measuring the
deviation from the 13-month average of the stock mutual fund cash/assets ratio, adjusted for
interest rates and during the period from 1965 through February 2010, a level above 0.1 pro-
duced an annual gain of 8.4%, and a level below –0.7 produced a gain of only 0.3%.
In neither instance are the results exceptional. Although some watch the mutual fund
cash/assets ratio, it appears to be only a marginal indicator of uninformed sentiment.

Rydex Funds
Mutual fund management companies within the past few years have presented both style and
leverage to their public offerings. Rydex Global Advisors (www.rudexfunds.com) has been par-
ticularly inventive in its styles. Not only do these include standard long-only stock mutual funds,
but also funds that replicate market averages, such as the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, and oth-
ers that add leverage to the portfolios. These are called bull funds because they increase in value

110 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
when the stock market rises. Contrarily, Rydex offers inverse funds in the same style that are
short the averages and other indexes. These are called bear funds because they increase when the
stock market declines. If the public expects the market to rise, they will purchase the bull funds
and sell the bear funds, and vice versa. The ratio of the assets held by these two funds, thus, pro-
vides an indication of what direction the uninformed investors in the funds expect the market will
travel.
Ned Davis Research, Inc., found that when these investors become optimistic, invariably
the market performs oppositely. Indeed, from January 1994 through July 2010, when the ratio
rose above 82.5, when more people were purchasing the bull funds than the bear funds, the stock
market declined 16.4% per annum, and when these investors loaded up on the bear funds, the
stock market advanced 51.7% (see Figure 7.11). These results show an outstanding relationship
between sentiment and future market direction.

Margin Balances
Each week, Barron’s reports the NYSE margin debt for the previous month. Traditionally, ana-
lysts have considered margin balances evidence of what the uninformed speculator is doing,
especially at market peaks. Remember that when uninformed investors are most optimistic, they

have placed most of their capital in the market and, thus, may buy stocks on margin to leverage
their position. More recently, margin debt reflects professional speculators and might not be as
useful as before. Taking away from the usefulness of margin debt for market forecasting is the
ability through derivatives of holding positions outside the Federal Reserve requirements for
margin, which only apply to banks. Part of the risk incurred by the Long Term Capital Manage-
ment (LTCM) operation was over a trillion dollars in derivative contracts, most of which required
very little margin. Thus, Barron’s weekly report of margin debt, which at one time was a very
reliable indicator, is no longer an accurate gauge of market sentiment. The relationship between
margin debt and the S&P 500 from 1970 through 2010 is shown in Figure 7.12.

Money Market Fund Assets
Where margin debt looks at speculators who are borrowing money to leverage their positions,
money market funds are the repository of funds when uninformed players decide to pull back

that money market fund assets would increase as investors become more pessimistic and that
would, thus, be a sign that the market is bottoming. Ned Davis Research, Inc., found exactly that

the subsequent market rise was 10.9% per annum. When the percentage declined to and below
10.8, the annual loss per annum was 12.5%.

Relative Volume
Another reliable indicator of uninformed sentiment is the ratio of NASDAQ to NYSE volume
(see Figure 7.14). This ratio gradually increases as public enthusiasm for speculative stocks on
the NASDAQ increases, and NASDAQ volume increases relative to NYSE volume. The peak in
a trend seems to occur when the ratio peaks, and the bottom of the trend occurs after the bottom
in the ratio. Ned Davis Research, Inc., during the period August 1998 through January 2010 (see
Figure 7.14), found that when the volume ratio increased above 1.4, the S&P 500 lost 20.9% per
annum, and when the ratio declined below 1.1, the S&P 500 gained 30.0% per annum, making
this an easy-to-calculate indicator with a profitable history.

Uninformed Short Selling
Historically, short selling has been predominately a professional activity. It is even more so today
with the many derivative securities traded. The modern use of derivatives requires short selling to
reduce risk. Thus, the old relationship of short selling having to do solely with opinion about the
prospect for companies has diminished. On the other hand, the total amount of short selling
seems to increase with an increase in the market direction and is, thus, a contrary opinion indica-
tor.
The Short Interest Ratio is calculated from data provided by the major exchanges, tradi-
tionally the New York Stock Exchange, on a monthly basis, and reported in Barron’s and other
financial papers. It is calculated by taking the total amount of stocks sold short as of the specific
day of the report divided by the average volume for the month. Colby (2003) reports that over the
69 years of data from 1932 to 2000, using a buy signal when the current ratio was greater than its
74-month exponential moving average, and a sell signal when the 74-month average was broken,
a sizable return resulted but it still underperformed the buy-and-hold strategy. This signal worked
only for long positions and was out of the market for 457 months, more than half the time.

Ned Davis Research, Inc., (see Figure 7.15) found that the ratio of the 3-month simple
moving average to the 45-month simple moving average of short interest was a useful indicator
market performance during the 1945–2010 period. When the ratio rose above 1.5 and investors
were generally pessimistic, the market advanced 15.2% per annum, and when the spread
declined to and below 1.04, the market only declined 4.4% per annum. Interestingly, these results
occurred during the recent periods of derivative use when short selling was an active part of the
hedging process.

As for the usefulness of short selling data on individual stocks and determining the poten-
tial for a “short squeeze,” which is the rapid rise in a stock’s price as short sellers scramble to
cover, data on individual stocks is available but is often clouded by many variables. To get at
information that is more useful on a company basis, considerable digging and filtering must be
done to eliminate the influence of derivative transactions that may have little to do with the
prospects for the firms. Phil Erlanger (www.erlanger.com) accomplishes a considerable amount
of work in this area and publishes results periodically on his Web site. He has found several fil-
ters that must be applied to individual stock short sale data: (1) The data must be adjusted for
splits—not only price adjustments, but also volume and short interest; (2) it must be normalized
to adjust for short-term volume fluctuations; and (3) it must be normalized to adjust for historic
volatility. A ranking is established, placing the stock within its smoothed, historical context over
a five-year period. This ratio establishes the potential attractiveness of the stock. This number

should not be used as a mechanical buy signal, however, because the short sellers may be correct
in anticipating the stock to decline.
Odd-Lot Short-Selling
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed how odd-lot statistics have generally fallen out of favor as a
measure of uninformed sentiment because the option markets have now replaced small stock
orders as a means of speculation. The only odd-lot statistic to have some validity today is the
odd-lot short sale data. Traditionally, short selling is considered a speculative endeavor. Most
trading in the stock markets, but the commodity markets, is done on the long side, either initiat-
ing an invested position or selling that position. A short sale is a trade that anticipates a down-
ward price swing, requires margin, and has infinite risk of loss. It is, thus, used mostly by
speculators. Odd-lot short sellers are, therefore, speculators and their position sizes suggest a
lack of sophistication. It turns out that, indeed, they are an excellent indicator of uninformed sen-
timent and, thus, an excellent contrary indicator of market direction.
Ned Davis Research, Inc., found that odd-lot statistics still have some predictive ability.
Figure 7.16 shows the results from combining two odd-lot ratios with a put/call ratio into a con-
trary indicator of market direction. For the period January 2002 through mid-July 2010, the indi-
cator when showing a preponderance of optimism, resulted in a 6.2% decline per annum, and
ptg
when showing a preponderance of pessimism, resulted in a 27.3% advance. These are impressive
results and show that the odd-lot trader is still with us and still acts in an uninformed manner.

116 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Unquantifiable Contrary Indicators
Over the years, analysts have watched a number of developments in the society around them in
an attempt to gauge the overall mood, emotion, and sentiment of market participants. Many of
these indicators are qualitative and not quantitative. Although these indicators are not easily
quantifiable and do not lend themselves to traditional statistical testing, they still provide impor-
tant information to the technical analyst.
One of these unquantifiable indicators is the magazine covers theory. The media covers the
news but with a strong bias. It is selling news to those who are interested. If the stock market is
high and ready to decline, the media would be unlikely to report the danger even if they know it.
Instead, they will emphasize the fact that the market has risen and is strong. They want people to
listen, to subscribe, and to read their output, and they will not get business if they report contrary
to the popular beliefs of the day. Their business is providing their subscribers with what they
want. Thus, when major news magazines such as Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report,
Barron’s, the Economist, or BusinessWeek include on their cover an article on the stock market,
up or down, they are emphasizing what the public believes and already knows—and as has been
shown previously, the public is generally wrong, at least at extremes. For this reason, these sto-
ries usually occur at or before major turning points in the stock market.
Paul Macrae Montgomery, currently with Universal Economics, has studied magazine ptg
covers back at least to 1923. He has observed that after a positive major magazine cover story on
the stock market, 60% to 65% of the time the market has gained about 30% per annum over the
first one to eight weeks. Eighty percent of the time, however, the market has then reversed within
a year and sustained significant losses (Baum, 2000).
In 2007, University of Richmond Professors Arnold, Earl, and North (2007) published in
the Journal of Finance a study on the market action of the stock of companies featured as cover
stories in BusinessWeek, Fortune, and Forbes between 1983 and 2002. They found that the cover
feature article usually followed the stock performance rather than the reverse. A negative story,
for example, tended to occur after the decline in the company’s stock, and a positive story
occurred after a stock rise. They did not find any statistically significant results in postarticle per-
formance, either momentum or contrary (with or against the previous trend). They concluded
that if one has a position in a stock that had a good run up or down and a cover story appeared in
one of those magazines explaining the reason for the price move, it was probably time to close
the position.
Not only does the media report about the market (which provides some idea about the sen-
timent of the market players), but the reports of the media also impact the mood and emotions of
investors. A study commissioned by the Wall Street Journal (Klein and Prestbo, 1974, as
reported in Kaufman, 1998), found that 99% of financial analysts read a newspaper regularly.
Ninety-two percent of these analysts considered the newspaper the “most valuable” publication
they read. Obviously, the news is important. However, rapid and correct interpretation of facts is
difficult. Sometimes factual news is immediately interpreted by the market incorrectly. For
example, when Saddam Hussein was captured, the stock market opened up with a large gap just
from the joy of the news. When investors thought about the consequences of that news, they real-
ized it did not change anything, and the stock market closed down that day. Informed traders in a
method called “event trading” likely sold into this emotional opening. It is a method of rapidly
gauging the sentiment produced by a news announcement, determining whether the market is

Chapter 7 Sentiment 117
overacting, and if it is, acting contrarily. Another aspect of event trading is gauging whether the
market or a stock is acting as it should on particular news, and if it is not, perhaps the news was
already discounted in the price and a change in direction is due. Event trading or news trading is
a very short-term use of contrary opinion.
BOX 7.4 ECCENTRIC SENTIMENT INDICATORS
Over the years, stock market followers have developed a number of “eccentric indi-
cators” to predict stock market movements. Not based on economic or financial data,
these indicators are “feel-good” or “hype” indicators that attempt to measure the
overall morale of the investing population. One of the oldest feel-good indicators,
first suggested by either the late Ralph Rotnem of Harris, Upham & Company (now,
after a long string of mergers, Citibank) or Ira Cobleigh & DeAngelis (1983), fol-
lowed women’s hemlines: As hemlines rose, so did the stock market, and as hem-
lines fell, so did the stock market. Consider the Roaring 20s, when women wore
short flapper skirts and a stock market rise followed. When the stock market crashed
during the great depression, long, modest skirts followed. The hemline index implies
that as people become more exuberant, stock prices rise and clothing becomes more ptg
daring, and as society becomes more pessimistic, people become more conservative
with their clothing and investment choices. Market and economy watchers have also
considered beer versus wine sales (people drink more beer when the market is down
and approaching a low), sedans versus coupes (people buy more sedans and fewer
coupes when the market is down), lipstick sales (when the market is down, women
buy cheaper brands), aspirin (a rise in sales correlates with distress about the mar-
ket), and the number of golf balls left at the driving range (people don’t leave balls
when the market is declining).
It must be emphasized that none of these indicators has an effect on stock prices.
If a direct relationship exists, it exists only as correlation without a direct link to the
markets. Indicators, to be truly useful, must have a rationale for their existence. Cor-
relations may be purely accidental and, thus, meaningless. For a discussion of how
some of these offbeat indicators have performed, go to www.Forbes.com/2001/06/
28/exotics.html.
Historical Indicators
There are several indicators that technical analysts have used historically that you may see dis-
cussed in the literature. Although these indicators have little relevance today, at one time they
played a prominent historical role in the measurement of market sentiment.
The first is NYSE member and nonmember statistics. The advent of off-board trading and
of electronic trading, complicated by the use of derivatives for hedging, marginalized the useful-
ness of this data. At one time, the various ratios (nonmember short sale ratio, public to specialist

118 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
short sale ratio, and specialist short sale ratio) had some useful, predictive meaning in the stock
market. No longer, however, do these figures mean anything. Because the marketplace itself has
changed so drastically, the member figures have gone out of use and are considered unreliable.
The second historically important sentiment indicator to have fallen from favor is the Bar-
ron’s Confidence Index. This index, developed in 1932, measures the ratio of yields on high-
grade bonds versus yields on speculative bonds. Although it is still published today, it seems no
longer to have relevance for measuring stock market sentiment.
HOW IS THE SENTIMENT OF INFORMED PLAYERS MEASURED?
Thus far, we have focused mainly on the sentiment of the uninformed market players. Remember
that these market participants often make incorrect market decisions, especially at market
extremes. Therefore, the sentiment of the uninformed players is used in a contrarian strategy.
Now, we center our attention on the sentiment of informed players—those most likely to make
correct market decisions.
Insiders ptg
The ultimate informed player, at least in individual stocks or commodities, is the insider. An
insider is anyone who is a knowledgeable member of a firm that either trades in the commodity
underlying the future most important to the firm’s business, such as oil to an oil company or
cocoa to a candy company, or who has knowledge of a company’s internal business prospects
and results and is a stockholder. Naturally, these people will act for their own benefit, hopefully
within the law, and buy and sell based on their knowledge. Under SEC regulations, corporate
insiders must report any stock transactions they make within a month, and in turn the SEC
reports these transactions weekly. Because insiders are not allowed to profit from transactions in
their company’s stock for six months, their actions are a long-term indicator of prospects for the
company beyond six months. Investors Intelligence and Vickers Stock Research have found that
the compilation of all insider transactions is useful for forecasting the stock market a year out
from the reports.
Sell/Buy Ratio
The Sell/Buy ratio is compiled by Vickers Stock Research Corporation, a subsidiary of Argus
Research Group (www.argusgroup.com). It takes into account the total number of insider buy
and sell transactions for each company, the percentage of change in insider holdings, the unanim-
ity of the transactions within each company, reversals in transaction patterns, and very large
transactions. A plot of the Sell/Buy ratio for 2006 is shown in Figure 7.17.
Vickers considers a ratio under 2.25 a portent of a higher stock market, and a ratio greater
than 2.25 as a sign of impending market problems. Colby (2003) found that between 1971 and
2000, the ratio averaged over five weeks produced for longs only when the smoothed ratio
declined below 2.25, a 29.2% profit over buy-and-hold. Bjorgen and Leuthold (2002), using only
large insider block transactions, found that from 1983 to 1999, only a small percentage of the

time do insiders transact their shares in a one-sided direction, but the three times that they
showed excessive buying, the stock market bottomed within several weeks. On the sell side,
when excessive selling occurred, the market peaked, and it either declined or consolidated
approximately a year later, thus confirming the observations of Investors Intelligence outlined
next.

FIGURE 7.17 Insider Sell/Buy ratio (October 2005–October 2006)
Investors Intelligence Method
Investors Intelligence (www.investorsintelligence.com) follows insider activity in two ways.
First, for over 1,600 stocks they calculate the total insider buy and sell transactions over the pre-
vious nine months. This figure is then compared with the same figure three months prior. This
gives them an estimate of the recent direction that insiders are taking with their stock. Second,
they break down insider activity into industry groups and compile group rankings that they find
often precede the directional movement of stocks within each group. An example of this analysis
is shown in Figure 17.18.
Secondary Offerings
As the stock market rises and long-term interest rates increase, companies tend to offer second-
ary offerings of stock. Sometimes insiders wanting to sell stock cause this, and sometimes it is
caused by a desire to raise cheap capital for expansion. Whatever the reason, increased second-
ary offerings of stock should increase as the market rises and give warning of a peak. Conversely,
when insiders are staying away from the secondary market, the stock market is likely at or close
to a bottom. Ned Davis Research, Inc., looked into this phenomena and found a weak correlation
that confirmed the previous thesis. By calculating a ratio of the 5-month simple moving average
of secondary offerings to the 45-month moving average, they found that when the ratio rose
above 1.47, the percentage gain per year following was 0.7, whereas when the ratio declined to
109 and below, the gain per year increased to 12.9% (see Figure 7.19).

Chapter 7 Sentiment 121
Large Blocks
Large blocks tend to be transacted on behalf of professionals. There are several ways that large
block data is used. The first is the use of the total number of large block volume relative to the
total volume traded. This figure gives an indication of when the large block trader is transacting
the most number of shares relative to the market as a whole. Colby (2003) found that when the
large block ratio crossed above its 104-week exponential moving average, a buy signal was gen-
erated that was profitable 70% of the time with a net profit of 511% over the period from 1983 to
2001. This strategy was only successful on the long side. The short side, which was triggered by
the ratio declining below its 104-week average, ended with a loss.
The anxiousness with which stocks are traded is shown by whether buyers trade on upticks
or downticks. Aggressive buyers anxious to get a position in a stock will buy large blocks on
upticks. The ratio of blocks traded on upticks to those on downticks is, therefore, an indicator of
this professional interest in owning stocks.
Ned Davis Research, Inc., found that when large blocks transact predominately on
downticks and then reverse direction, a profitable signal was generated in a study from January
1978 through February 2010 (see Figure 7.20). This seems to suggest that although large blocks
trade at a market bottom on downticks during the latter stages of panic, when that panic is over
and substantial investors begin to take offers on upticks, they know what they are doing and the
ptg
stock market is invariably at a bottom. The results of the study showed an annual gain of 15.0%
over the buy-and-hold of 9.9% per annum on the long side only. Using large block tick data on
the short side was unproductive, thus confirming the directional bias observed by Colby (2003).

Art Merrill studied transactions of large blocks of 50,000 or more shares. Merrill divided
the blocks into categories of upticks, downticks, and flat, smoothing each category’s data. He ran
a ratio of the uptick average to the downtick average, smoothing that ratio over 52 weeks and cal-
culating the running standard deviation from the smoothed average. This provided significant
directional signals of 66%, 81%, and 76% over the next 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks,
respectively (Colby 2003).
Commitment of Traders (COT) Reports
This study examines whether actual trader position-based sentiment index is useful
for predicting returns in the S&P 500 index futures market. The results show that
large speculator sentiment is a price continuation indicator, whereas large hedger
sentiment is a contrary indicator. Small trader sentiment hardly forecasts future mar-
ket movements. Moreover, extreme large trader sentiments and the combination of
extreme large trader sentiments tend to provide more reliable forecasts. These find-
ings suggest that large speculators possess superior timing ability in the market.
(Wang, 2003, p. 891)
With regard to S&P 500 Index futures, we find that large speculator sentiment is a
ptg
price continuation indicator, whereas large hedger sentiment is a weak contrary indi-
cator. Small trader sentiment does not forecast returns. We show that extreme levels
and the combination of extreme levels of sentiments of the two types of large traders
may provide a more reliable tool for forecasting. Our result suggests that large spec-
ulators may be associated with superior forecasting ability, large hedgers behave like
positive feedback traders, and small traders are liquidity traders. (Wang, 2000)
In 1974, Congress created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC; www.cftc.gov)
to do the following: (1) “protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abu-
sive practices related to the sale of commodity and financial futures and options” and (2) to “fos-
ter open, competitive, and financially sound futures and option markets.”
Each week, the CFTC reports on the large positions held in 22 different futures markets,
including stock and bond futures, metals, currency exchange rates, and agriculturals. The
reports, called the Commitments of Traders or COT, are for positions held as of Tuesday’s close
and are published on Friday. Only those markets with 20 or more traders holding positions large
enough to meet the CFTC requirements are included in the reports.
The “public” position is then taken as the difference between total open interest in each
future less those positions held by the traders required to report. The trading positions are divided
into two major categories: commercial and noncommercial. This nomenclature is an outgrowth
of the agricultural origins of the reports. In the financial markets, the commercial traders, indi-
vidual or institutional, are those who operate in the cash market and are thus called hedgers. The
noncommercial participants take speculative positions, change positions more frequently, and
are called large speculators. Traditionally and empirically, in the stock market, the large specula-
tors have a better record of anticipating market moves, whereas the hedgers tend to lag behind
and follow the trend (Wang, 2000). Thus, an indicator should consider the spread between the

large speculator and the hedger. The small speculators tend to be dysfunctional, and their statis-
tics are of little value.
With respect to the S&P 500 futures, Ned Davis Research, Inc., considered only the com-
mercial (hedger) positions and found a correlation between their changes in position and the sub-
sequent market gain or loss (see Figure 7.21). They took the net position of commercial traders
as a percentage of the 78-week range, smoothed over six weeks. Later, you will be exposed to an
oscillator called the stochastic. This NDR calculation is a long-term stochastic. When the sto-
chastic advances above overbought at 55%, i.e., when the commercials have large positions, the
S&P 500 futures tended to rise 16.0% per annum. When the commercials were bearish and the
stochastic declined to 31.5% and below, the market declined 9.0%. This method is the most reli-
able one of understanding what the professional, informed traders are doing.

Because the futures market in the stock market is fractionalized by hedging between mar-
kets and other financial instruments, the COT figures for any one market might not be reliable.
Tom McClellan, editor of the McClellan Market Report (www.mcoscillator.com), combines all
the stock futures data into one series of indicators on a dollar-weighted basis and then watches
the commercials (hedgers) net long positions as a percentage of the total. He finds that it has
recently had a three-week lead to cash stock prices.

124 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
A number of tests have used COT data in stock futures, as well as data reported by the
CFTC. The most workable systems appear to use smoothed data to normalize the longer-term
trends and find that the relationship between commercials and noncommercials are different over
time and between futures contracts. It thus behooves the technical analyst to experiment with the
different methods for each future contract to see what works best and to update that work contin-
ually to expose any changes in relationships between the major players in each market.
SENTIMENT IN OTHER MARKETS
Given the subject matter of this book, our focus thus far in this chapter has been on the stock
market. However, we complete our discussion of sentiment by presenting a few major measures
of sentiment in other markets.
Treasury Bond Futures Put/Call Ratio
The advent of an options market in futures has created a whole world of new sentiment indicators
for these futures markets. The most widely traded are the options of Treasury Bond futures. The
chart in Figure 7.22 shows the latest study by Ned Davis Research, Inc., of the predictive ability of
these options using the standard put/call volume ratio as a proxy for speculation in the Treasury ptg
Bond market. What they found was that when ratio advanced above 1.03, the market had too much
pessimism and that the subsequent advance per annum averaged 5.7%. On the other hand, when the
ratio declined below .66, the market was too euphoric and subsequently declined 9.1% per annum.

Treasury Bond COT Data
The spread between large speculators and commercial hedgers is positively correlated with bond
prices and inversely related to long-term interest rates (see Figure 7.23). Ned Davis Research,
Inc., found that in the period between August 1992 and February 2010, when large speculators
were net long, the bond market rose on average 4.8% per year and declined 4.7% per year when
the relationship inverted.

Treasury Bond Primary Dealer Positions
Contradicting the preceding relationship between commercials and the future for the bond mar-
ket is the relationship between primary dealer inventories and the future for bond prices. One
would think that primary dealers in bonds, those who can deal with the Treasury Department
directly, would have hedged inventory positions in long-term bonds and would thus be consid-
ered part of the commercial hedger designation by the CFTC in the COT reports. Further, this
would suggest that the dealers would be net long at bond market bottoms and net short at tops.
The opposite seems to be the case. Primary dealers have tended to have the most long positions

at tops and the most short positions at bottoms (see Figure 7.24). The reason for this logical dis-
parity is likely that dealers must anticipate customer demands. They buy issues from the auction
and then sell them to customers. If customers have been bullish, dealers must have an inventory.
Thus, they tend to be long at the top when they believe their customers are bullish and willing to
pay extra for bonds. Likewise, when pessimism reigns, dealers are hesitant to build inventory and
instead hold net short positions, believing that the pessimism will cause customers to sell to
them. Thus, at bottoms, dealers become net short.

T-Bill Rate Expectations by Money Market Fund Managers
The money market fund business is highly competitive. Money managers, in order to compete on

of their T-bill positions. Longer maturity positions suggest that money managers believe that
short-term rates will decline, and shorter positions indicate a belief that short-term interest rates

will rise. This has turned out to be a contrary indicator for the T-bill market yield. Money man-
agers have tended to be generally incorrect in their assessment of the future for short-term rates.
As seen in Figure 7.25, when money managers increase the maturity of their positions in antici-
pation of lower rates, the rates generally rise instead, and vice versa when they shorten their posi-
tions in anticipation of a rise in rates.

agers and found that when the average maturity in days rose above its six-month simple moving
average, the 91-day Treasury bill rate advanced 102 basis points per annum. This measure then
is a contrary indicator because when rates are expected to rise, managers should be shortening
their maturity length to await the higher rates. Instead, when they believe the rates will go down,
it appears they lengthen their maturity, and the T-bill market does just the opposite of their
expectations. When the maturity length declines below its six-month simple moving average, the
rate tends to advance, making this calculation a good contrary indicator of Treasury bill rates.

HULBERT GOLD SENTIMENT INDEX
Mark Hulbert publishes a newsletter, the Hulbert Financial Digest, a subsidiary of MarketWatch,
that follows the performance of other investment newsletters. He has been doing this since 1980.
His methods are similar to those of Investors Intelligence. A number of these newsletters discuss
the price of gold. Using this information, Hulbert calculates an index of gold market sentiment.
As with other measures of investment-advisory newsletters, the performance results prove to be
an excellent contrary indicator of the market’s future direction. Ned Davis Research, Inc., looked
at this data and concluded that when the percentage of gold bulls advanced above 59, the price of
the XAU, a gold mining stock index, plunged 47.6% per annum, and when the percentage
declined below 7, the XAU advanced 91.9% per annum. The results are shown in Figure 7.26.

and periods of extreme pessimism, when crashes or panics occur. The uninformed market play-
ers tend to be most optimistic as the market reaches a peak. These same individuals tend to be
most pessimistic when the market is at its lowest point in a downturn. In other words, most
investors are fully invested just at the time they should liquidate their holdings and out of the
market just at the point when they could be buying stocks at a low price. Sentiment indicators
help the technical analyst pick these market extremes. By following a contrarian strategy, the
technical analyst hopes to act opposite of the uninformed, majority of market players.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should
• Understand the importance of measuring internal market strength ptg
• Understand what is meant by market breadth
• Be familiar with how the advance-decline line measures market breadth
• Be familiar with how up and down volumes relate to market strength
• Be familiar with how new high and new low statistics measure market strength
• Be familiar with the relationship between the number of stocks above their historical
moving average and market strength
In the previous chapter, we looked at the importance of market player sentiment in determining
potential market trends. In addition to measuring the attitudes of market players, the technical
analyst needs to look at the internal strength of a market. By looking at data specific to each mar-
ket, the analyst determines whether the internal strength of the respective market is improving or
deteriorating. In this chapter, we examine how the analyst looks at market data such as the num-
ber of stocks advancing and declining, the volume of the winners and losers, the new 52-week
highs and lows, and the position of the averages relative to moving averages. These measures
help to gauge the stock market’s underpinnings. The data needed to calculate the indicators stud-
ied in this chapter is publicly available in most financial newspapers.

132 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
BOX 8.1 WHAT IS DIVERGENCE?
The most important technical concept for confirmation of a trend is called a diver-
gence. As long as an indicator—especially one that measures the rate of change of
price or other data (called momentum)—corresponds with the price trend, the indi-
cator is said to “confirm” the price trend. When an indicator or oscillator fails to con-
firm the trend, it is called a negative divergence or positive divergence, depending
on whether peaks or bottoms, respectively, fail to confirm price peaks or bottoms. A
divergence is an early warning of a potential trend change. It means the analyst must
watch the price data more closely than when the indicators and oscillators are con-
firming new highs and lows. Divergence analysis is used between almost all indica-
tors and prices; a divergence can occur more than one time before a price reversal.
Divergence Confirmation
ptg
As an example, one of the tenets used in analyzing trading volume is that in a rising
trend, volume should expand with the price rise. If at a new short-term peak in prices
the trading volume fails to expand above its earlier, time-equivalent high, a negative
divergence has occurred that should warn the analyst that the new price high is
occurring on less enthusiasm, as measured by volume, and that the uptrend may
soon be ending.
It should be noted that knowledge of a wide array of technical indicators does not make an
analyst valuable or cause him or her to profit, but knowing when to apply which indicator does.
Because it is almost impossible to understand all indicators, the technical analyst often selects
just a few and studies them intently.

Chapter 8 Measuring Market Strength 133
When looking at indicators, the analyst is generally looking for confirmation or diver-
gence. Confirmation occurs when prices are rising and these indicators rise, signaling strong
market internals. Confirmation also occurs when falling prices are accompanied by an indication
of weak market internals. In other words, confirmation occurs when price movement and market
internals appear to agree.
When a market indicator does not support the direction of price movement, the analyst has
a strong warning that the trend may be in the process of reversing. This lack of confirmation is
referred to as a divergence.
One quick example is an indicator called the rate of change indicator (ROC). It is merely a
plot of the ratio or difference between today’s closing price and the closing price at some speci-
fied time in the past, such as 20 days. When the market or stock is hitting a new high and the 20-
day ROC is hitting a new high, we have a confirmation of the price action. Should the ROC not
be hitting a new high at the same time as the market or stock, we have a negative divergence, a
warning that the upward momentum in price is slowing down.
There is another type of divergence called a reversal suggested by Constance Brown
(1999). This occurs when the oscillator or indicator, in a positive reversal, reaches a second low
that is not confirmed by another new low in prices. The opposite, the negative reversal, occurs
when the oscillator reaches a new high but prices do not. Both cases are just variations of a diver-
gence, and as in a normal divergence, each occurrence signals a potential change in market direc- ptg
tion.
MARKET BREADTH
On any given day, a stock price can do one of three things—close higher, lower, or unchanged
from the previous day’s close. If a closing price is above its previous close, it is considered to be
advancing, or an advance. Similarly, a stock that closes below the previous day’s close is a
declining stock, or a decline. A stock that closes at the exact price it closed the day before is
called unchanged.
Prior to July 2000, all less than one dollar (or point) changes in common stock prices were
in fractions based on the pre-Revolutionary practice of cutting Spanish Doubloons into eighths to
make change. By February 2001, the old system of quarters, eighths, and sixteenths was replaced
with the decimal system. The use of decimals may have affected some historic relationships. The
resulting smaller bid-ask spreads may have reduced the number of stocks that are unchanged at
the day’s end.
Advance/decline data is called the breadth of the stock market. The indicators we focus on
in this section measure the internal strength of the market by considering whether stocks are
gaining or losing in price. In this section, we consider the cumulative breadth line, the advance-
decline ratio, breadth differences, and the breadth thrust.
Before we begin looking more closely at these particular indicators, we must, however,
mention a change that has recently occurred. Since 2000, the parameters of many breadth indica-
tors thought to provide accurate signals have changed significantly. Applying standards that had
excellent records for identifying stock market reversals now proves to be less than satisfactory.
There is likely more than one reason for this sudden change, and some reasons are unknown.

134 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
One factor that has caused the old parameters to change is the proliferation on the New
York Stock Exchange of ETFs, bond funds, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), preferred
shares, and American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of foreign stocks. These do not represent
domestic operating companies and, therefore, are not directly subject to the level of corporate
economic activity. They are subject to a wide variety of influences not necessarily connected
with the stock market, which means they are not reflecting the market’s traditional discounting
mechanism.
Another possible factor is the implementation of the aforementioned decimalization. Many
of the indicators using advances and declines are calculated as they were before decimalization,
even though their optimal parameters may have changed. Another possibility, one more likely, is
that the aberrant indicators were tested mostly during the long bull market from 1982 through
2000. The important lesson for the technical analyst, however, is that indicators do not remain
the same. Parameters for known indicators change over time and with structural changes in the
markets. The analyst must frequently test indicators and make appropriate adjustments in the
types and parameters used.
The Breadth Line or Advance-Decline Line
The breadth line, also known as the advance-decline line, is one of the most common and best ptg
ways of measuring breadth and internal market strength. This line is the cumulative sum of
advances minus declines. The standard formula for the breadth line is as follows:
Breadth Line Value = (# of Advancing Stocks – # of Declining Stocks ) +
Day T Day T Day T
Breadth Line Value
Day T–1
On days when the number of advancing stocks exceeds the number of declining stocks, the
breadth line will rise. On days when more stocks are declining than advancing, the line will fall.
A breadth line can be constructed for any index, industry group, exchange, or basket of
stocks. In addition to being calculated using daily data, it can be calculated weekly or for any
other period for which breadth data is available. It is not often applicable to the commodity mar-
kets where baskets or indices of commodities rarely are traded, though this is changing with the
advent of the Commodities Research Bureau (CRB), Goldman Sachs, and Dow Jones futures
index markets.
Ordinarily, the plot of the breadth line should roughly replicate the stock market averages.
In other words, when the stock market averages are rising, the breadth line should rise. This indi-
cates that a market rally is associated with the majority of the stocks rising.
The importance to technical analysts of the breadth line is the time when it fails to replicate
the averages and, thus, diverges. For example, if the stock market average is rising but the
advance-decline line is falling, only a few stocks are fueling the rally, but the majority of stocks
are either not participating or declining in value.
Analysts point to several reasons why breadth divergence might not be as powerful of an
indicator in the future as it has been in the past. The first reason is the previously discussed pro-
liferation of nonoperating company listings. To deal with the issue of the bias from including
stocks that do not represent ownership in operating companies, technical analysts often use only

Chapter 8 Measuring Market Strength 135
those breadth figures from common stocks that represent companies that actually produce a
product or a service. For example, the New York Stock Exchange also reports breadth statistics
for only common stocks, disregarding the numerous mutual funds, preferred stocks, and so on.
This additional breadth information is available daily in most financial newspapers. The breadth
line derived from this list of common stocks generally has been more reliable than the one
including all stocks.
However, a major change recently occurred in how the NYSE reports breadth statistics for
common stocks. Beginning in February 2005, the NYSE decided to include only those stocks
with three or less letters in their stock symbols and those that are included in the NYSE Compos-
ite Index, its common stock list. Because of this change, figures since that decision will be
incompatible with the prior figures.
Instead of relying on the publicly available statistics, proprietary breadth statistics also are
available on a subscription basis. For example, Lowry’s Reports, Inc., (www.lowrysreports.com)
calculates proprietary breadth statistics that eliminate all the preferred stocks, ADRs, closed-end
mutual funds, REITs, and others representing nonproductive companies.
Another difficulty with the breadth has arisen since the year 2000 according to Colby
(2003) and others using data up through 2000. Trading rules used with the publicly available
breadth statistics before then, despite the known problems with the types of stocks listed, showed
relatively attractive results. However, using those same rules since the year 2000, we find much ptg
less attractive results in many of these indicators. Indeed, the difference is so large and consistent
throughout the trading methods mentioned by Colby that it could not be attributed to the trading
rules themselves or to problems connected with optimizing. The difference between then and
more recently must have to do with a change in background, character, leadership, or historic
relationships.
Why this change? The most obvious economic change is that of the decoupling of the
stock market from long-term interest rates. From the Great Depression of the 1930s to the last
decade of the last century, the business cycle was characterized by the bond market and the stock
market reaching bottoms at roughly the same time, and the bond market reaching peaks earlier
than the stock market reached peaks. In the late 1990s, this business-cycle relationship broke
down, switching to almost the exact opposite relationship, whereby the bond market tended to
trend oppositely from the stock market. Because the breadth statistics include a large number of
interest-related stocks that are not included in the popular averages, this change in relationship
may be the cause for the difference in trading rules using breadth, giving the breadth line more
strength at tops and more weakness at bottoms.
In the NASDAQ, a cumulative breadth line constructed of only NASDAQ stocks advances,
declines, and unchanged has been declining at least since 1983 (earlier figures are difficult to
obtain), and even when looked at over shorter periods seems to have a very strong negative bias.
This negative bias is likely due to the “survivor effect,” whereby from 1996 to 2005, stocks listed
on the NASDAQ declined from 6,136 to 3,440. The loss of issues from the list suggests that a
large number of listings went broke during that time and were trending downward even when the
larger survivors were advancing and were unavailable during the rebound in stock prices from
2002 through 2005. The NASDAQ index is a capitalization-weighted index where the survivors
have considerable influence on price but little influence on breadth. This weighting bias implies

that a NASDAQ breadth line is useless as a divergence indicator in its absolute form and must be
analyzed instead for changes in acceleration rather than direction.
Several indicators using the advance-decline line concept appear in the classic technical
analysis literature. Although these indicators have not performed well in recent market condi-
tions, it is important for the student of technical analysis to be aware of these traditional indica-
tors because they may become productive sometime in the future.
Double Negative Divergence
When the averages are reaching new price highs and the breadth line is not, a negative diver-
gence is occurring (see Figure 8.1). This signals weak market internals and that the market
uptrend is in a late phase and may soon end. In 1926, Colonel Leonard P. Ayres (1940) of the
Cleveland Trust Company was one of the first to calculate a breadth line and the first to notice the
importance of a negative breadth divergence from the averages. His theory was that very highly
capitalized stocks influence the averages, while the breadth line includes all stocks regardless of
capitalization. Sometimes at the end of a bull market, the large stocks continue to rise, and the
smaller stocks begin to falter.

FIGURE 8.1 What does negative divergence look like?
Other market analysts, such as James F. Hughes (Merrill, Stocks and Commodities Maga-
zine V6: 9, p 354–5), argued that the rise in interest rates accompanying an economic expansion
reflected in the stock market causes the interest-related stocks—such as utilities, which have
large capital borrowing costs and of which there are many—to falter and, thus, causes the
breadth line to lose momentum. Regardless of the cause, since May 1928, when a negative
breadth divergence warned of the 1929 crash more than a year later, the observance of a negative
divergence has invariably signaled an impending stock market top.
Although a negative divergence signals a market top, a primary stock market top can occur
without a divergence. In other words, a breadth divergence is not necessary for a market peak.

Chapter 8 Measuring Market Strength 137
The peaks in 1937 and 1980, for example, occurred without a breadth divergence. After a sizable,
lengthy advance, participants should be on guard and use a breadth divergence to help spot a
potential market reversal. However, an analyst should not be adamant about requiring a breadth
divergence to occur prior to a market peak.
At market bottoms, especially those that are characterized by climactic price action, a pos-
itive divergence in the cumulative breadth line rarely has been reliable in signaling a major rever-
sal upward. However, there have been positive breadth divergences on either tests of major lows
or so-called secondary lows that were useful signals of increasing market strength.
A characteristic of the breadth line that the analyst needs to recognize is that there is a
downward bias to the line. Therefore, a new cumulative breadth line, one that has no relationship
to the previous breadth line, begins once the market reaches a major low. For example, calculat-
ing a historical cumulative breadth line for the NYSE data resulted in an all-time peak in 1959.
Although the cumulative breadth line has never reached the same 1959 level, there was a consid-
erable rise in the market averages through 2000. This does not indicate a very large negative
divergence over a 40-year time span. The cumulative breadth line, for divergence analysis, starts
again once a major decline has occurred. When the market declines into a major low, one of the
four-year varieties (see Chapter 9, “Temporal Patterns and Cycles”), analysis of the cumulative
breadth line begins anew, and the line has no relationship to the peak of the previous major mar-
ket cycle. It is as if a major decline wipes out the history of past declines, and the market then ptg
begins a new breadth cycle and new history.
A negative divergence, while not being required, has been the most successful method over
the past 50 or more years for warning of a major market top. As with most indicators, different
technicians use the breadth indicators in slightly different ways. For example, James F. Hughes,
who published a market letter in the 1930s, learned of the breadth divergence concept from Col.
Ayres (Harlow, 1968; Hughes, 1951). He used the negative breadth divergences as a major input
to his stock market forecasting. Hughes required that at least two consecutive negative breadth
divergences, called double divergences (see Figure 8.2), must occur before a major top was sig-
naled. This requirement prevented mistakes in forecasting from the appearance of a single minor
divergence that could later be nullified by a new high in both the averages and the breadth line.
Often, more than two divergences occur at major market tops.
When the double breadth divergence warning occurs, it traditionally signals an actual mar-
ket price peak within a year. Beginning with 1987, for example, a double breadth divergence cor-
rectly anticipated the 1987 crash when the breadth line peaked in April 1987, and five months
later, in September, the market peaked and then collapsed. The breadth line peaked in the fall of
1989 followed by a peak in the average in July 1990. The most recent breadth peak signaled by a
double breadth divergence was the 2007 peak in breadth and the 2008 peak in the averages, as
shown in Figure 8.2. Similar to the 1928–1929 double divergence, the time between the breadth
peak and the market peak stretched to 21 months, considerably longer than the traditional ten
months. As Figure 8.2 shows, however, the double negative divergence in 2007 foretold the com-
ing stock market collapse in 2008–2009. The lag between the divergence and the final low is not
constant, but the theory of a double divergence warning of a major market decline is still valid.

Traditional Advance-Decline Methods That No Longer Are Profitable
Over the past ten years the market has changed, rendering the old methods of using moving aver-
ages and reversals as signals no longer reliable. Consider the following evidence that traditional
advance-decline methods are no longer profitable:
• Advance-decline line moving average—Colby mentions this as a profitable method
prior to 2000. It is calculated by calculating a 30-day moving average of both the Stan-
dard & Poor’s 500 and the breadth line. When both the index and the line are above
their moving averages, the market is bought, and vice versa when they are both below
their moving averages. In an optimization program, we found the 30-day moving aver-
age period unreliable and that the period of the moving average should be increased to
the vicinity of 75 days. Even so, profitability only began after 2007.
• One-day change in advance-decline line—The simplest signal occurs when the
advance-decline line changes direction in one day. However, this method also has
become unprofitable since 2000. Again, using an optimization program, we found that
reversals after 75 days proved the most profitable but only beginning in 2007.
This is useful information in that it warns students of the markets that the methods of
analysis are fluid, constantly changing, and should be thoroughly tested before implemented in
an investment plan.

John Stack in an interview with Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities (Hartle,
1994) mentions using an index that compares the breadth line and a major market index. His pur-
pose is to reduce the necessity of looking at an overlay of an indicator on the price chart to dis-
cern when a divergence has occurred. Instead, he calculates an index that tells whether breadth is
improving or diverging from the market index and, thus, whether a warning of impending trou-
ble is developing. Arthur Merrill (1990) also devised a numerical method to determine the rela-
tive slope of the breadth line versus a market index. By following the slope over time, we can
calculate periods in which the breadth line is gaining or losing momentum. The advantageous
aspect of this type of indicator is that it also measures the relative momentum when prices are
declining.
BOX 8.2 WHAT IS AN OSCILLATOR?
At times, you will see us referring to a particular indicator as an oscillator. Oscilla-
tors are indicators that are designed to determine whether a market is “overbought”
or “oversold.” Usually, an oscillator will be plotted at the bottom of a graph, below
the price action, as shown in Figure 8.3. As the name implies, an oscillator is an indi-
cator that goes back and forth within a range. Overbought and oversold conditions ptg
(the market extremes) are indicated by the extreme values of the oscillator. In other
words, as the market moves from overbought, to fairly valued, to oversold, the value
of the oscillator moves from one extreme to the other. Different oscillator indicators
have different ranges in which they vary. Often, the oscillator will be scaled to range
from 100 to –100 or 1 to –1, but it can also be open-ended.
Advance-Decline Line to Its 32-Week Simple Moving Average
Analysts have developed several variations of using the advance-decline line. One method is to
compare it with its own moving average to give buy and sell signals for the market and, thus, cre-
ate an oscillator. Ned Davis Research, Inc., used a ratio of the NYSE advance-decline line to its
32-week simple moving average. They found that from 1965 to 2010 when the ratio rises above
1.04, the per annum increase in stock prices as measured by the NYSE Composite Index was
19.3%, and when it declined below 0.97, the stock market declined 11.2% per annum. This oscil-
lator is pictured in Figure 8.3.

Breadth Differences
Indicators using breadth differences are calculated as the net of advances minus declines, either
with the resulting sign or with an absolute number. The primary problem with using breadth dif-
ferences is that the number of issues traded has expanded over time. For example, in the 40-year
time period from 1960 to 2000, the number of issues on the New York Stock Exchange doubled
from 1,528 issues to 3,083 issues. By 2010, the number had increased to 3,200 issues. More
issues means larger potential differences between the number of advances and declines. Any
indicator using differences must, therefore, have its parameters periodically adjusted for the
increase in issues traded. Examples of indicators using breadth differences are listed next.
Haurlan Index
Peter N. Haurlan worked as a rocket scientist for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the 1960s,
where he projected trajectories of satellites. Haurlan was one of the first to use a computer to ana-
lyze stock data. Combining his knowledge of mathematics, his access to a computer (which was
extremely rare at the time), and his interest in the stock market, Haurlan began calculating expo-
nential moving averages (EMAs; see Chapter 14, “Moving Averages”) in stock data. Haurlan pub-

lished his methodology in a pamphlet (“Measuring Trend Values”) and began privately publishing
the Trade Levels Reports.
The Haurlan Index is calculated very simply. The basic index is daily advances minus declines
exponentially smoothed with a 3-day exponential moving average (Haurlan, 1968). Haurlan gener-
ated trading rules with this oscillator. His original rules were to buy and sell on the crossing of the
zero line in the oscillator. Haurlan also considered several longer-term exponential moving averages.
He calculated a 20-day exponential moving average of advances minus declines data to identify
divergences. He also considered a 200-day exponential moving average to determine the primary
trend. He did not use these longer averages, however, to generate mechanical trading signals.
Paul Carroll, in an article in Stocks & Commodities (1994) indicates that crossovers in each
of the Haurlan averages through zero give reliable signals. He also indicates that reliable extreme
signals occurred at specific levels in each average. These levels were +/–200 for the 20-day and
+/–550 for the 200-day. A buy signal occurred when the EMA crossed above the upper level, and
a sell signal occurred when the EMA declined below the lower limit. Since then, however, the
changes in the breadth statistics from more stocks being listed and from decimalization have
upset the reliability of the old rules. Indeed, the 3-day EMA is no longer valid at all. As shown in
Figure 8.4, the 20-day has positive results when the outer limits are extended to +/–500, and iron-
ically, better results occur when the buy signal occurs at the EMA breaking down from the upper
limit, and the sell signal when the EMA breaks upward from the lower limit. The tenuous nature ptg
of this method because it depends on the characteristics of the breadth statistics suggests that it
should be used with extreme caution.

BOX 8.3 WHAT IS AN EQUITY LINE?
An equity line is a graph of a potential account value beginning at any time adjusted
for each successive trade profit or loss. It is used to measure the success of a trading
system. Ideally, each trade is profitable and adds to the value of the account each
time a trade is closed. Any deviation from the ideal line is a sign of drawdown,
volatility, or account loss, all of which are unavoidable problems with any trading or
investment system. For profitable systems, the equity line should rise from left to
right with a minimum number of corrections. For more information about equity
lines, see Chapter 22, “System Design and Testing.”
McClellan Oscillator
In 1969, based on Haurlan’s use of advance and decline data, Sherman and Marian McClellan
developed the McClellan Oscillator. This oscillator is the difference between two exponential
moving averages of advances minus declines. The two averages are an exponential equivalent to
ptg
a 19-day and 39-day moving average. Extremes in the oscillator occur at the +100 or +150 and
–100 or –150 levels, indicating respectively an overbought and oversold stock market.
BOX 8.4 MCCLELLAN MTA AWARD
In 2004, Sherman and Marian McClellan were honored as recipients of the Market
Technicians Lifetime Achievement Award. For more information about the McClel-
lans’ work, go to www.mcoscillator.com/user/McClellan_MTAaward.pdf.
The rationale for this oscillator is that in intermediate-term overbought and oversold peri-
ods, shorter moving averages tend to rise faster than longer-term moving averages. However, if
the investor waits for the moving average to reverse direction, a large portion of the price move
has already taken place. A ratio of two moving averages is much more sensitive than a single
average and will often reverse direction coincident to, or before, the reverse in prices, especially
when the ratio has reached an extreme.
Mechanical signals occur either in exiting one of these extreme levels or in crossing the
zero line. A test of the zero crossing by the authors for the period April 2000 to February 2005,
to see if the apparent changes in the breadth statistics had any effect on the oscillator, proved to
be profitable. A test of crossing the +100 and –100 levels proved to be unprofitable largely
because these extremes were not always met. By using stops, however, the performance
improved. Divergences at market tops and bottoms were also informative. The first overbought
level in the McClellan Oscillator often indicates the initial stage of an intermediate-term stock
market rise rather than a top. Subsequently, a rise that is accompanied by less breadth momentum

and, thus, a lower peak in the oscillator is suspect. At market bottoms, the opposite appears to be
true and reliable. Finally, trend lines can be drawn between successive lows and highs that, when
penetrated, often give excellent signals similar to trend line penetrations in prices.
McClellan Ratio-Adjusted Oscillator
Because he recognized that the use of advances minus declines alone can be influenced by the
number of issues traded, McClellan devised a ratio to adjust and to replace the old difference cal-
culation. This ratio is the net of advances minus declines divided by the total of advances plus
declines. As the number of issues changes, the divisor will adjust the ratio accordingly. This ratio
is usually multiplied by 1,000 to make it easier to read. The adjusted ratio is then calculated
using the same exponential moving averages as in the earlier version of the oscillator. In a study
of the usefulness of this oscillator, we optimized the possible overbought and oversold levels and
found that +/–35 was the best level. Indeed, we found that the trading rule required a sell when
the oversold level was penetrated from above, and the opposite buy rule for overbought. This
produced over the period March 2000–February 2010, a 265% return for the period over a buy-
and-hold loss of 24%. Figure 8.5 shows the equity line for this study.

McClellan Summation Index
The McClellan summation index is essentially a measure of the area under the curve of the
McClellan Oscillator. It is calculated by accumulating the daily McClellan Oscillator figures into
a cumulative index. The McClellans found that the index has an average range of 2,000 and
added 1,000 points to the index such that it now oscillates generally between 0 and 2,000, and
neutral is at 1,000. Originally, the summation index was calculated with the differences between
advances and declines, but to eliminate the effect of increased number of issues, the adjusted
ratio is now used. This is called the ratio-adjusted summation index (RASI). It has zero as its
neutral level and generally oscillates between +500 and –500, which the McClellans consider to
be overbought and oversold, respectively. Although no mechanical signals are suggested, the
McClellans have mentioned that overbought readings are usually followed by a short correction
that is followed by new highs. A failure to reach above the overbought level is a negative diver-
gence and, thus, a sign that a market top is forming. Colby reports that only on the long side do
intermediate-term signals profit (with an average holding of 172 days) given when the summa-
tion index changes direction.
Plurality Index
This index is calculated by taking the 25-day sum of the absolute difference between advances ptg
and declines. Because the calculation accounts only for the net amount of change independent of
the directional sign, it is always a positive number. The stock market has a tendency to decline
rapidly and rise slowly. Therefore, high numbers in the plurality index are usually a sign of an
impending market bottom, and lower numbers suggest an impending top. Most signals have been
reliable only on the long side because lower readings can occur early in an advance and give pre-
mature signals. Traditionally, the signal levels for this indicator were 12,000 and 6,000, but the
increase in the number of issues has made these signal numbers obsolete (Colby, 2003). Colby
uses a long-term (324-day) Bollinger Band (see Chapter 14) breakout of the upper two standard
deviations for buys and below two standard deviations for a sell to close. This method produced
admirable results and has continued to do so since 2000. There are very few signals, and a 15- or
30-day time stop should be used for longs only.
One additional suggestion for eliminating the effect of the increase in the number of issues
listed over time is to use the McClellan ratio method of dividing the numerator by the sum of the
advances and declines. Thus, the 25-day plurality index raw number becomes the absolute value
of the advances minus declines divided by the sum of the advances and declines. This can then be
summed over 25 days. One problem both for accuracy of testing and for usefulness of the plural-
ity index is that very few trades are initiated or held for long, and not all major market bottoms
are signaled.
Absolute Breadth Index
Whereas the Hughes breadth oscillator uses a ratio of the raw difference between advances and
decline divided by the total issues traded, the absolute breadth index uses the absolute difference
of the advances minus declines divided by the total issues traded. Thus, the index is always a pos-
itive number. By experiment, Colby (2003) found that from 1932 to 2000, a profitable signal was
generated when this index crossed the previous day’s 2-day exponential moving average plus

81%. His report for longs only, which were held for an average of 13 days, only beat the buy-
and-hold by 35.1% over the entire 68-year period, without commissions or slippage. Ned Davis
Research, Inc., (see Figure 8.6) found an 11.7% annual gain versus a buy-and-hold gain of 7.7%
per annum in long trades only between February 1977 and February 2010 using a 10-day mov-
ing average. Using the Colby method since 2000, however, we found the long trades occurred
less frequently and were held only an average of 2 days. In the entire period, only 20 long trades
were made. However, 60% of these trades were profitable and returned a total 608% versus a
17.75% loss with buy-and-hold. The major problem with this method is that only 3 of the 20
trades were outstanding over the 10-year period, and only 2 trades per year were made on aver-
age. This means a long wait before a profitable trade and numerous small trades of little conse-
quence in between. Most investors or traders do not have the patience for this type of system.

FIGURE 8.6 Absolute Breadth Index (February 1977–July 2010)
Unchanged Issues Index
The unchanged issues index uses a ratio of the number of unchanged stocks to the total traded.
The theory behind it is that during periods of high directional activity, the number of unchanged
declines. Unfortunately, with the decimalization of the stock quotes, the number of unchanged
has declined, and the ratio now appears to have almost no predictive power. Testing this indica-
tor, we have found negative results in almost all instances since April 2000.

Breadth Ratios
Instead of using the difference between daily or weekly advances and declines, which can be
overly influenced by the increase or decrease in the number of issues listed, breadth ratios use a
ratio between various configurations of advances, declines, and unchanged to develop trading
indicators and systems for the markets. Using ratios has the advantage of reducing any long-term
bias in the breadth statistics. These ratios usually project very short-term market directional
changes and are of little value for the long-term investor. They have also changed character and
reliability since the year 2000.
Advance-Decline Ratio
This ratio is determined by dividing the number of advances by the number of declines. The ratio
or its components are then smoothed over some specific time to dampen the oscillations. Figure
8.7 presents testing of the success of using the advance-decline ratio over the 1947 to 2010
period by Ned Davis Research. Using daily breadth statistics, 30 buy signals were generated
when the ratio of ten-day advances to ten-day declines exceeded 1.91. These signals averaged a
17.9% return over the following year. In only one of the 30 instances did the signal fail, and the
loss then was only 5.6%.

Chapter 8 Measuring Market Strength 147
Colby (2003) reports that taking a one-day advance-decline ratio and buying the Dow
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) when the ratio crossed above 1.018 and selling it when the ratio
declined below 1.018, in the period from March 1932 to August 2000, would have turned $100
into $884,717,056, assuming no commissions, slippage, or dividends. Turnover, of course,
would have been excessive—an average of one trade every 3.47 days—but the results were
excellent for both longs and shorts. We tested this system for the period from April 2000 to Feb-
ruary 2010 and found that until 2005, the results were still credible. However, since 2005, the
equity line collapsed (see Figure 8.8). This negates, for now, the one-day method of trading the
advance-decline ratio.

Breadth Thrust
A thrust is when a deviation from the norm is sufficiently large to be noticeable and when that
deviation signals the beginning of a new trend, usually upward. Figure 8.9 shows that during the
period from 1979 to 2010, when the breadth ratio thrust above 1.65, the stock market rose an
average of 17.6% over the next 52 weeks. The thrust in this example is calculated as the five-
week total of the weekly advances to total issues ratio less the weekly declines to total issues
ratio. It appears still to be valid in 2010.

FIGURE 8.9 Advance-decline ratio and breadth thrust (January 1979–July 2010)
Martin Zweig devised the most common breadth thrust indicator, calculating a ten-day
simple moving average of advances divided by the sum of advances and declines. Traditionally,
the long-only signal levels in this oscillator were to buy when the index rose above 0.659 and sell
when it declined below 0.366. With these limits, however, this method has not had a signal since
1994. In testing the calculation using a moving average between four and six days, we found that
the original signal limits were profitable again for longs only. Why did the results for this indica-
tor suddenly change in 1994? We do not know. Again, these changes are excellent examples of
why the analyst must frequently review the reliability of any indicator being used.
One other way to use Zweig’s calculation is to generate a signal when the ratio reverses
direction (Colby, 2003). Although this method continues to be profitable, it suffered a severe
drawdown from October 2002 to October 2003, bringing into question its long-term viability.
Summary of Breadth Indicators
It appears that since 2000, a period of declining then rising stock prices, the breadth indictors for
short-term signals that had previously had admirable records mostly failed. These failures are the
reason why technical analysts must constantly test and review their indicators. Many changes
occur in the marketplace, both structurally—as, for example, the change to decimalization and

the inclusion of many nonproducing stocks in the breadth statistics—and marketwise—as, for
example, the disconnection between stock prices and interest rates. No indicator remains prof-
itable forever, both because of these internal changes, as well as the overuse by technical analysts
who recognize their value. Apparently, the best remaining breadth usage is the old Ayres-Hughes
double negative divergence analysis and the ten-day advance-decline ratio. They have had mini-
mal failures for over 60 years. Before an indicator is used in practice, however, it must be tested
objectively. No indicator should be used just because it has demonstrated positive results in the
immediate past.
UP AND DOWN VOLUME INDICATORS
Breadth indicators assess market strength by counting the number of stocks that traded up or
down on a particular day. An alternative way to gauge market internals is to measure the up vol-
ume and down volume. Daily up volume is volume traded in declining stocks. Up and down vol-
ume figures are reported in most financial media.
Considering the volume, rather than only the number of shares traded, places more empha-
sis on stocks that are actively trading. With the breadth indicators, a stock that moves up on very
ptg
light trading is given equal importance to one that moves up on heavy trading. By adding volume
measures, the lightly traded stock does not have as much influence on the indicator as a heavily
traded stock. The one caveat with using volume is that occasionally an enormous trade in a low-
priced stock will upset the daily figures. This happened on December 9, 2009, when 3.76 billion
Citigroup shares traded. The up and down volume statistics for that day were useless. Finally, the
use of dark pools, off-exchange trading, and other methods of avoiding the reporting of transac-
tions as well as the increase in trading in stocks that are part of ETFs have upset the earlier bal-
ance between volume and the individual investor. Many stocks are traded today as commodities
in an index, for example, not because they are worthwhile investments. Volume as a statistic has,
thus, become another aspect of change in the marketplace, and its use for technical indicators is
changing and should be approached with caution.
The Arms Index
One of the most popular up and down volume indicators is the Arms Index, created by Richard
W. Arms, Jr. (winner of the MTA 1995 Annual Award). The Arms Index (Arms, 1989), also
known by its quote machine symbols of TRIN and MKDS, is reported daily in the financial
media.
The Arms Index measures the relative volume in advancing stocks versus declining stocks.
When a large amount of volume in declining stock occurs, the market is likely at or close to a
bottom. Conversely, heavy volume in advancing stocks is usually healthy for the market. The
Arms Index is actually a ratio of two ratios, as follows:
Advances
Declines
Arms Index =
UpVolume
DownVolume

150 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
The numerator is the ratio of the advances to declines, and the denominator is the ratio of
the up volume to the down volume. If the absolute number of advancing shares increases on low
volume, the ratio will rise. This higher level of the Arms Index would indicate that although the
number of shares advancing is rising, the market is not strong because there is relatively low vol-
ume to support the price increases. This ratio, thus, travels inversely to market prices (unless
plotted inversely), tending to peak at market bottoms and bottom at market peaks. This inverse
relationship can initially be confusing to the chart reader.
Similar to breadth ratios, the Arms Index can be smoothed using moving averages and
tested for parameters at which positions can be entered. An Arms Index greater than 1.0 is con-
sidered to be a bearish signal, with lower levels of the index indicating a more favorable market
outlook. In our experiments, however, for the period February 2000 through February 2010, we
found that when the Arms Index rose above 1.0, it was a short-term buy signal. The trick was not
the entry per se but the exit. Using the Diamonds (ETF for the DJIA) and after optimizing for the
exit, we used a stop loss of 0.53, a breakeven of 0.01, and a trailing stop of 0.48 points, respec-
tively. This produced a return on account of 5,334% versus a buy-and-hold of a 7% loss for the
period. Because the sell stops reduced capital risk, the maximum drawdown was negligible.
However, it was only invested in the DIA 8% of the period.

Chapter 8 Measuring Market Strength 151
Colby (2003) introduced a number of calculations that showed promise until the year
2000. A long-standing panic signal, devised by Alphier and Kuhn (1987), is to buy the stock mar-
ket when the Arms Index exceeds 2.65 and hold it for a year. This signal has occurred twice since
2000, with one win and one loss. The win, however, was considerably larger than the loss.
When we shortened the holding period to 40 days rather than the original 252 days, the
performance of the signals was outstanding, a return of 97% versus a 1.8% buy-and-hold. It
appears, then, that the signal is still valid, but the analyst must watch the holding period after the
signal.
Ned Davis Research, Inc., found a way to use the Arms Index for selling as well as buying.
They calculated a 40-day moving average and various thresholds (shown in Figure 8.11) for buy-
ing and selling. Their performance showed an 11.2% annual gain versus an 8.4% annual gain
from a buy-and-hold strategy.

Modified Arms Index
Generally, a high number above 1.0 in the Arms Index is bearish and a low number bullish. How-
ever, take an example of a hypothetical day when 1,000 issues advance and 100 decline with 1m
up volume and 200,000 down volume. From these numbers, the Arms Index would be calculated

as 2.00, a bearish number, yet the market action was obviously bullish (1,000/100 advances to
decline). To combat this problem, Dave Steckler calculates a modified index by multiplying
advance issues times advancing volume and subtracting from that figure the product of declining
issues times declining volume. This index can sometimes be negative. Then he sums the modi-
fied index over 11 days, smoothes the total with a 10-day moving average, and plots the result.
He claims that it often diverges a few days earlier at market tops and bottoms.
Ninety Percent Downside Days (NPDD)
Paul F. Desmond in his Charles H. Dow Award paper (Desmond, 2002) presents a reliable
method for identifying major stock market bottoms that uses daily upside and downside volume
as well as daily points gained and points lost. The volume figures are reported in the financial
media, as are the stock tables. Unfortunately, the sum of points gained and lost is not reported
publicly and requires considerable handwork or a computer. A 90% downside day occurs when
on a particular day, the percentage of downside volume exceeds the total of upside and downside
volume by 90% and the percentage of downside points exceeds the total of gained points and lost
points by 90%. A 90% upside day occurs when both the upside volume and points gained are
90% of their respective totals. What he found was that
ptg
• An NPDD in isolation is only a warning of potential danger ahead, suggesting,
“Investors are in a mood to panic” (Desmond, 2002, p. 38).
• An NPDD occurring right after a new market high or on a surprise negative news
announcement is usually associated with a short-term correction.
• When two or more NPDDs occur, additional NPDDs occur, often 30 trading days or
more apart.
• Big volume rally periods of two to seven days often follow an NPDD and can be prof-
itable for agile traders but not for investors.
• A major reversal is signaled when an NPDD is followed by a 90% upside day or two
80% upside days back-to-back.
• In half the cases, the upside reversal occurred within five trading days of the low. The
longer it takes for the upside day reversal, the more skeptical the investor should be.
• Investors should be careful when only one of the two upside components reaches 90%.
Such rallies are usually short.
• Back-to-back 90% upside days are relatively rare but usually are long-term bullish.

10-to-1 Up Volume Days and 9-to-1 Down Volume Days
Whereas Desmond combines breadth and volume for his panic indicator, Ned Davis Research,
Inc., studied up and down volume alone without confirmation from breadth. Their rules are a lit-
tle complicated, a sign that the analyst should beware. Complicated rules are usually those that
are constructed from curve fitting and might not be viable in the future because they only fit past
data. However, the results of these studies were impressive and just demonstrated the contrary
opinion thesis that panics are often times to buy and sharp, steep rises from lows especially often
signal the end of a decline.
Specifically what they found was that roughly six months after a 10-to-1 up volume day,
the market was 9% higher (see Figure 8.12), and that after roughly six months following a 9-to-
1 down volume day, the market was 6% higher (see Figure 8.13). Shorter periods after each sig-
nal were also higher but not by the same percentage. In other words, each of these events
suggested a panic bottom.

FIGURE 8.13 9-to-1 down volume days (January 1998–July 2010)
NET NEW HIGHS AND NET NEW LOWS
When the stock market is rising, it is only reasonable to assume that individual stocks are mak-
ing new highs. Conversely, stock market declines are associated with stocks making new lows.
Generally, a stock is considered to reach a new high if the day’s price is higher than the
price has been over the past year. Prior to 1978, new highs and new lows were measured from
January of the current year only, but in 1978, the New York Stock Exchange began determining
new highs and new lows based on trailing 52-week prices. Other exchanges also adjusted their
reporting at that time for consistency with the NYSE figures. Thus, a stock reaches a new high
when the price is higher than it has been anytime during the previous 52 weeks, not necessarily
when it has reached a new all-time high.
The financial press reports 52-week highs and lows, but the period of 52 weeks is not
sacred. Analysts calculate many other periods based on their individual investment horizons. For
short-term breakouts, for example, 10 or 21 days are used. In any case, the number of new highs
and new lows is a useful measure of the number of stocks participating in an advance or decline.
It is, thus, an indicator of a continuing trend and usually subject to divergence analysis, similar to
breadth statistics.

Chapter 8 Measuring Market Strength 155
The raw data of new highs and new lows is subject to the same problems as breadth in that
the number of issues listed on an exchange will often change over time and make indicators
using differences between highs and lows unreliable and subject to constant change in indicator
parameters. As in breadth indicators, the way around this difficulty is to divide the difference
between the new highs and lows by the total issues traded on the exchange, thus eliminating any
bias from the changing number of listings.
New Highs Versus New Lows
The most straightforward, and probably useful, index is to buy when the number of new highs
exceeds the number of new lows on a daily basis and to sell when the opposite occurs. Colby
(2003) reports very favorable results on both sides of the market, long or short, but the holding
period is relatively short. One interesting aspect of net new weekly highs and lows (see Figure
8.14) is that they generally peak before the market peaks, similar to the breadth line. This
extremely reliable observation can warn us when we see a negative divergence in weekly high-
low data that a correction is due soon. (Average lead is 33 weeks with a wide error.)

156 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
High Low Logic Index
Norman Fosback (1976) is the developer of the high-low logic index. This index is defined as the
lesser of two ratios: the number of weekly new highs to total issues or the number of weekly new
lows to total issues. Low index levels tend to suggest a strongly trending market. A low number
would indicate that either a low number of new highs and/or a low number of new lows are
occurring. A high index level implies mixed market because the index can only be high when the
number of both new highs and new lows is large.
Analysts traditionally smooth this index over ten weeks with a moving average (see Chap-
ter 14). With either the raw or smoothed data, levels are then determined at which a signal is gen-
erated. Generally, high levels are bearish and low levels are bullish. In the first edition of The
Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators, authors Robert Colby and Thomas Meyers (1988)
reported that from 1937 to 1987, the results from such indicators were highly significant to the
99.9% confidence level. Their thresholds for raw data were above 0.020 for a down market one
to three months later, and below 0.002 for an up market one to six months later. For the ten-week
smoothed index, a downward market was signaled above 0.058 for three months, and an upward
market was signaled below 0.005 for three and twelve months later. Figure 8.15 shows Ned
Davis Research, Inc., data and their thresholds for buying and selling. It is obvious that the buys
are more reliable than the sells. ptg

Hindenburg Omen
Many indicators use a combination of other indicators to derive a signal. The Hindenburg Omen
is such an indicator. Very similar to Fosback’s high-low logic index, this indicator was devised by
Jim Mikkea and was named by Kennedy Gammage (Colby, 2003) after the Hindenburg Dirigible
disaster of 1937. Obviously, it signals a market reversal downward and includes:
• The 52-week highs and lows are each greater than 2.2% of total issues.
• The small number of new highs or new lows is greater than 75.
• The ten-week moving average of the NYSE Composite Index is rising.
• The McClellan Oscillator is negative.
• New highs cannot be more than two times the number of new lows (OK for new lows
to be two times the number of highs).
• Confirmation, defined as two or more occurrences within a 36-day period, exists.
(Source: Robert M. McHugh, PhD, article in www.safehaven.com/
showarticle.cfm?id=3880)
ptg
This indicator reportedly occurred prior to every major crash since 1985 (including the
1987 crash). Twenty-seven confirmed omens have occurred with only two failing to be followed
by a decline of 2% or more. The other subsequent declines were not all crashes because the omen
often gives false signals for crashes. However, the odds of a crash (down more than 15%) are
about 27% after a confirmed signal. Clusters of signals don’t seem to have any correlation to the
extent of the subsequent decline. One major problem with the derivation of this indicator is that
it is so complex. As mentioned earlier, complexity usually comes from curve fitting and is, thus,
potentially unreliable. The Hindenburg Omen, however, is based on technical logic and is cer-
tainly something to follow.
USING MOVING AVERAGES
The indication of a trending stock usually is gauged by whether the stock price is above or below
a moving average. The longer the moving average, the longer the trend the relationship repre-
sents. Looking at how many stocks are trending gives us a measure of market strength.
Number of Stocks above Their 30-Week Moving Average
One indicator of overbought and oversold markets, as pictured in Figure 8.16, is the number of
stocks above or below their 30-week moving averages. This indicator essentially measures the
number of stocks in uptrends and downtrends. It is a contrary indicator, however, in that when
the percentage of stocks above their 30-week moving averages reaches above 70%, the market is
inevitably overbought and ready for a correction. Conversely, when the percentage of stocks

below their 30-week moving average declines below 30%, the market is at or close to a bottom.

The 80/60 Rule
One interesting variation in the use of stocks above their 30-week moving average is the 80/60
rule. This rule states that when the percentage of stocks above their 30-week moving average has
been greater than 80% and then declines below 60%, the percentage will decline to or close to
30%. In other words, a serious decline will likely follow such a signal. Figure 8.17 by Ned Davis
Research, Inc., suggests that of the 13 instances of this occurring since 1968, 12 resulted in a
general market decline. The one exception was in 1991 during the protracted bull market of the
1990s.

VERY SHORT-TERM INDICATORS
Although market sentiment indicators generally focus on spotting long-term trend reversals, the
concept of sentiment can be used as a short-term contrarian indicator. Let’s look at a few ways in
which following these indicators might provide clues to short-term trading opportunities.
Breadth and New Highs to New Lows
Although breadth and new high-low data tend to be indicators of trend, and divergence analysis
is useful in determining when a known trend may be reversing, short-term readings of breadth
and new high-low data are often contrary indicators. For example, when the daily breadth ratio of
advances to declines rises to 2/1 or 3/1, the subsequent market direction is more often down than
up. The opposite is also true for days in which the advance-decline ratio is 2/1 or 3/1 on the
downside. It often provides excellent buying opportunities for the very short term (that is, the
next week).

160 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
New highs and new lows show the same results. Trading with the longer-term trend is the
best method of maximizing profits. To enter the trend right after it has been recognized, however,
is often not profitable, at least until prices have retraced from their initial reaction. Thus, for
example, if the market is above its 200-day moving average and is presumably in a longer-term
uptrend, whenever the averages break to new 10-day lows is an excellent time to go long. Oppo-
sitely, when the market is below its 200-day moving average and thus in a longer-term down-
trend, whenever rallies take prices above their 10-day highs is when the best opportunity to sell
short exists. In this manner, the use of new highs and new lows, thus, can be used as a contrary
signal within the major trend and a way of profiting from price dispersions from the mean trend.
Net Ticks
Ticks represent actual trades. When a stock changes price, even by the smallest amount either an
uptick or downtick is produced. If the stock trades at its previous price, a zero-tick is produced.
By summing at any one instant the number of upticks versus downticks, the day trader has an
indicator of market action across the board. It is similar to an advance-decline ratio or difference
except that it is based on much more sensitive intraday data.
Generally, tick data is used as a contrary indicator because it measures very short-term
bursts of enthusiasm or fear. Extreme readings may indicate a longer-term change in trend, but ptg
usually the tick ratio oscillates within bounds throughout the day. When it is oversold, traders
will buy into the short-term fear, and when it is overbought, they will sell into the temporary
enthusiasm. Ratios and moving averages are used with this data in a similar manner as with
breadth statistics. Ticks can also be calculated for averages and indices such as the Dow Jones
Industrial, where only the stocks included in the average are measured.
Closing ticks can also be used similar to daily breadth statistics. Closing ticks represent the
trading action just at the close of trading and show whether traders are anxious or ambivalent. In
Figure 8.18, a ten-day moving average of net ticks shows oscillations in line with the averages.
Combining this indicator with one of the Arms Index (MKDS) and the NYSE Composite, Ned
Davis Research, Inc., found specific levels at which significant market moves could develop.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we focused on the measurement of market internal strength. One important factor
in measuring market internals is the calculation of market breadth line (advance-decline line).
Market breadth is a measure of how widely a market move is spread throughout the stock mar-
ket. In other words, measuring breadth tells the analyst whether an increase in the market index
is characterized by a large increase in the price of a few stocks or a smaller increase in the price
of the majority of the market stocks. Is the typical stock moving the same way that the market
index (which can be influenced by big moves in a few stocks) is moving? If so, the market direc-
tion is confirmed by the internals. If not, the internals and the index are diverging, indicating that
internal strength is changing.
Another way of looking at internal market strength is to look at up and down volume.
Instead of looking at the number of issues that advanced or declined on a particular day, look at
up and down volume measures. Using this type of measure, each stock issue is not given equal
weight. Instead, stocks with heavy trading volume are given more weight and play a more impor-
tant role in gauging internal market strength.

==================================================

162 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
A third major way to gauge internal market strength is to compare the current price of each
stock with its historical price. Looking at how many stocks are being traded at price extremes can
do this—that is, looking at stocks trading at new highs and new lows. Alternatively, it can be
done simply by comparing the current price with a historical average price of each issue to see
how many stocks seem to be moving in the same direction as the market index.
Whatever method is being used, the indicators presented in this chapter are designed to
measure whether there is enough strength internally to predict that the market trend will continue
in the direction it has been. Understanding how internal strength relates to broader market move-
ment is important. Unfortunately, we have seen many of the traditional indicators perform poorly
during the past few years. Only time will tell if the traditional indicators with their traditional
parameters will perform satisfactorily in the future. In the meantime, analysts continue to
develop, test, and refine ways to measure market internal strength. It is the job of the technician
to find what works best for the appropriate trading or investment time horizon.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
ptg
1. Explain what the term market breadth means.
2. Explain what the terms positive divergence and negative divergence mean.
3. An analyst appearing on the financial news made the following statement:
“Since the recent run-up in the S&P 500 has been accompanied by weak internals, I do not
have much confidence that the uptrend in the S&P 500 will continue much longer.”
Explain what the analyst means by weak internals. What types of statistics has the analyst
been looking at to determine that the market internals were weak?
4. Explain how looking at new highs and new lows can help an analyst determine internal
market strength.
5. Assume that market indices are all trending upward. What type of market internals would
you like to see to confirm these trends?
6. The Web site http://finance.yahoo.com reports useful information about market internals
every day. This information can be found under the heading Today’s Markets by clicking
on the Investing option. Look up the information for today’s trading. What would you con-
clude about the internal market strength today? Explain what information leads you to
your conclusion.
7. Use the information you gathered for Question 6 to calculate the Arms Index and the Mod-
ified Arms Index for the day. What information does each of these indicators give you?

EMPORAL ATTERNS AND YCLES
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with
• The long (50-60-year) Kondratieff wave cycle ptg
• The 34-year cycle
• The decennial cycle
• Four-year cycles, including the election year pattern
• Seasonal tendencies in stock performance
• The relationship between January stock market performance and the rest of the year
• The relationship between events and stock market performance
In the previous two chapters, we looked at ways to measure the sentiment of market players and
the internal strength of the stock market. In those chapters, we saw that the market alternates
between periods of strength and weakness. A major market cycle appears when market players
become more and more optimistic, sometimes to a point of euphoria, followed by a period of
market weakness, which is associated with increasing investor fear and panic. Seeing how this is
a repeated pattern, some analysts have focused their attention on attempting to predict these pat-
terns using cycle theory that is often similar to the cycle theory of the natural scientists. In Chap-
ter 19, “Cycles,” we cover how to analyze market data of unconventional cycles, but we now look
at cycles appearing to occur for understandable reasons.
Is there a time of the year that is the best to buy stocks? Do stocks perform better in one
month or season of the year than another? Does it matter what day of the month I buy stocks?
Should I buy stocks on a certain day of the week? How do stocks perform when there is an
upcoming presidential election? Does the weather affect stock performance? These are all exam-
ples of the types of questions that must be asked.

164 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Although a rigid cycle that would result in a specific, narrow rule (e.g., always buy stocks
on the first day of the month or never buy stocks in December) does not appear, the effects of
time do seem to display themselves in price patterns and cycles of varying shapes and lengths. In
many cases, the origin or cause of these cycles is unknown. Some analysts attempt to correlate a
variety of cycles to either economic events or stock prices, and these apparent relationships range
from the plausible to the ludicrous. Researchers have considered sunspots, rainfall in New York
City, phases of the moon, various planet positions, tilt of the earth, lynx populations in Canada,
tree rings, and elections, to name only a few of the possible causes.
Like the periodicity of the sun and moon to Stone Age man, the observations are unques-
tioned but the reasons are unknown. So far, only coincidental cycles have been found. Edward R.
Dewey (1947, 1971) founder of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, tabulated these coinci-
dental periodic peaks and troughs, beginning in the 1940s. The records and past journals of the
Foundation, in which many of these cycles are tabulated, have now been integrated with the
library of the Market Technicians Association. In this chapter, we discuss the most dominant of
these temporal effects associated with the stock market.
PERIODS LONGER THAN FOUR YEARS
ptg
Let’s begin by looking at cycles occurring over a long period (over four years) of time. These
cycles include Kondratieff waves, 34-year historical cycles, and decennial cycles.
Kondratieff Waves, or K-Waves
Nicolas D. Kondratieff, an economist who lived in Communist Russia, studied historical com-
modity prices in the 1920s. He analyzed European agricultural prices and copper prices from the
late eighteenth century to his time and noticed a periodicity in these prices of approximately 50
years. He then hypothesized that there were long cycles in economic activity in capitalist nations
that evolved and self-corrected and that the Marxist hopes for an approaching collapse of capital-
ism were misdirected. He was sent to a Siberian concentration camp, presumably for these
views, where he died in 1938.
Few of Kondratieff’s papers were originally published in the West, but more recently, a
large number have been collected and translated into a book, The Long Wave Cycle. The long
50–60 year cycle that he measured, known as the Kondratieff wave (or K-wave), is an economic
phenomenon that is not necessarily observable in commodity or stock prices.
It was Harvard economics professor Joseph A. Schumpeter, endorsing Kondratieff’s ideas
in the 1930s, who first used the name “Kondratieff wave” to refer to the cycle that Kondratieff
uncovered. The K-wave theory remained in academic contention, largely because of the few-
recorded instances, until the 1970s and 1980s, when the world economy slowed down and new
research on the importance of innovation added substance to the theory of K-waves. Today there
is a reasonable academic body of knowledge attached to K-wave theory. George Modelski and
William Thompson have written extensively on the topic. In their book, Leading Sectors and

Chapter 9 Temporal Patterns and Cycles 165
World Powers: The Coevolution of Global Economics and Politics, Modelski and Thompson
point to the following important aspects of the K-wave theory:
• Waves are attributes of the world economy led by a major national economy.
• Waves concern output rather than prices—sector output surges rather than general
macroeconomic performance.
• Waves unfold as phased processes, implying an S-shaped growth curve sequence
rather than mechanical and precise periodic cycles.
• Waves arise from bunching of innovations in product, services, technology, methods of
production, new markets, new sources of raw materials, and new forms of business
organization (from Schumpeter). This innovation spurt comes from earlier economic
slowdown, and its predominant innovative character (see Table 9.1) can identify each
wave.
• Each K-wave has its characteristic location—cotton in Manchester, Great Britain, or
technology in Orange County, California—and a clear location in time that can be
dated. World systems theorists can now date the theory back 19 separate waves to
ptg
Sung China, more than a thousand years ago.
• Each K-wave affects the structure of the world economy into the future.
• The long start-up of a K-wave is often accompanied by a major war.
• A significant relationship exists between the K-wave and the rise and fall of world
powers. A new K-wave in a new and different location suggests the next location for
global leadership. The K-wave grows out of necessity and innovation and then influ-
ences global power and politics as they evolve to accept the new economics.
The Kondratieff wave, therefore, is an interesting long-term phenomenon in economics
and world politics, but it has only marginal use in the stock, bond, and commodities markets. In
the 1970s, K-wave cycle theory increased in popularity as many people began watching what
would happen as the fiftieth anniversary of the 1929 stock market crash and Great Depression
approached. However, the rise out of the 1981–1982 stock market bottom, with the DJIA quickly
breaking the 1,000 level, which continued until the year 2000, eliminated interest in the K-wave
theory as applied to the stock market.
Because double K-waves seem to develop into even longer cycles of economic power and
global leadership and the United States is in the second cycle, the prospects for U.S. markets are
seemingly favorable for a third period of about 17 years after 2026, when the next wave is sched-
uled to begin. Of course, this period may, and likely will be, punctuated by wars and at least one
economic depression, but the U.S. prospects are still relatively favorable, even if replaced by
another innovative period somewhere else, with the K-wave cycle theory predicting at least a
trading market for the next 50 years in the United States.

Confirming the prediction of the start of a new K-wave period beginning around the year
2026 is the relationship researchers have found between the U.S. birthrate and the stock market.
A high correlation exists between the U.S. birthrate and U.S. stock market performance 46 years
later. As seen in Figure 9.1, this correlation has been very close since the mid 1950s. Should this
relationship continue, the birthrate data projects a major stock market bottom around 2020 fol-
lowed by another major, but slightly weaker rise than the 1980–2000 rise, into about the year
2050. The birthrate projection, of course, can change over the next 50 years, but for now, it
appears to confirm the projections of the K-wave.
34-Year Historical Cycles
Historical data suggests that 34-year cycles, composed of a 17-year period of dormancy followed
by a 17-year period of intensity, also appear to exist. Figure 9.2, for example, shows a 17-year
dormant period beginning in the mid 1930s in which movement in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA) was sideways. This trading range period was followed by a 17-year upward
trend period in the DJIA. The upward movement in the DJIA ended in the late 1960s. Then
another 17-year flat period followed into the mid 1980s and that also was followed by an upward
trend into the turn of the century. The market is currently in another flat period, presumably of 17
years that began than and will likely end between 2015 and 2020, which coincides with the Kon-
dratieff bottom expected from birth statistics mentioned previously.

Notice that during the mid-1930s to mid-1940s and mid-1960s to the early 1980s and since
2000 within the flat periods that volatility was very high. Declines of 35% and 50% occurred
within these periods, as well as sharp advances, yet the overall, longer-term trends remained rel-
atively flat. These are periods when technical analysts outshine fundamental analysts because the
buy-and-hold philosophy breaks down. In the intensive periods between the mid-1940s and mid-
1960s and early 1980s and early 2000s, the buy-and-hold investment philosophy returned as
prices generally rose, and profits were made regardless of analytical method. Since the turn of
the century in 2000, another dormant but volatile period began in which buy-and-hold strategies
are failing and technical analysis is returning as the most successful analytic method.
Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest men in the world, is not widely known to use techni-
cal methods; however, it is interesting to note that he has long used the 17-year cycle in his
investment planning. Buffet does not attribute the cycle to growth in the GNP, noting that in the
dormant cycle from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, the GNP grew at twice the rate as during
the intensive early 1980s to the turn of the century. Instead, he attributes the different periods to
changes in interest rates, corporate profits, and investor confidence in the economy, ideas he
learned from reading the book Common Stocks as Long-Term Investments by Edgar Lawrence
Smith (1928), which he claims most influenced his investment philosophy (Loomis, 2001).
ptg
Decennial Pattern
In his book Tides and the Affairs of Men (1939), Edgar Lawrence Smith presented the notion of
a ten-year stock market cycle. Smith’s theory resulted from combining two other theories, Wes-
ley Mitchell’s 40-month cycle theory and the theory of seasonality, both of which we cover in the
shorter-term cycles later in this chapter. Combining these two periods, Smith theorized that there
must be a ten-year, or 120-month, cycle. This would result from ten 12-month, annual cycles and
three 40-month cycles coinciding every ten years.
When Smith investigated prices more closely, he found that indeed there appeared to be a
price pattern in the stock market that had similar characteristics every ten years. This pattern has
since been called the decennial pattern.
The decennial pattern theory states that years ending in 3, 7, and 10 (and sometimes 6) are
often down years. Years ending in 5, 8, and most of 9 are advancing years (see Figure 9.3). Smith
did not follow the normal calendar year beginning in January but found that counting the begin-
ning of a year in October was more reliable. He also hypothesized that occasionally a 9-year or
11-year cycle overlaid the decennial cycle. He attempted to find the reason behind the decennial
pattern and looked at sunspots and solar radiation, average rainfall, barometric pressure, and
other weather-causing conditions, believing that weather patterns were the most likely cause of
change in human psychology. It was then well accepted that weather had an effect on health and
disease, and thus on optimism and pessimism, an observation first mentioned by Hippocrates.
The decennial pattern continues to have an excellent history. For example, the fifth-year
advance has been observed for well over 100 years to never have failed 12 out of 12 times,
though there is some question about whether 2005 advanced. Some market indexes were up
slightly, and some were down. Most foreign stock markets advanced.

One problem with the theory is that a large enough sample is not possible yet, and that
such projections could be the result of chance. It is something to keep in the back of an investor’s
mind but not something to use alone to commit funds to the stock market.

PERIODS OF FOUR YEARS OR LESS
A day is a definite period of time. A year, within small limits, is also definite. A
month, however, may be lunar or solar; it may also be a number of other things.
Hence 40 months of our present calendar must remain an approximation and cer-
tainly not an exact measure of the duration of cycles, if, as we shall be led to believe,
natural phenomena have some part in determining the pattern of their recurrence.

Four-Year or Presidential Cycle
Wesley C. Mitchell (1874–1948), economics professor and one of the founders of the National
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), was the originator of the 40-month cycle theory. He
empirically discovered that the U.S. economy from 1796 to 1923 suffered a recession, on aver-
age and excluding four wars, every 40 months, or approximately every four years.
Today, the four-year cycle, from price bottom to price bottom, is the most widely accepted
and most easily recognized cycle in the stock market. Occasionally it strays from four years, but
only by a portion of a year (see Figure 9.4). This is a remarkably consistent series.

Almost all cycles are measured from bottom to bottom. Tops fail to occur as regularly, but,
of course, their average interval is also four years (see Table 9.2). Some analysts have argued that
because the U.S. presidential elections are also four years apart, the cycle is due to the election
cycle (see the next section, “Election Year Pattern”). It is, thus, often called the “presidential
cycle.” However, this cycle also occurs in countries that do not have four-year elections, such as
Great Britain. It may be that U.S. economic strength is so huge and so globally powerful that
other countries are forced to follow its stock market cycles, or it may be that the 40-month
(almost four years) economic cycle Wesley Mitchell discovered 80 years ago is still dominant
but has been slightly stretched by economic and the Federal Reserve policy action. Whatever the
reason for its existence, the four-year cycle is obviously a very strong, important, and reliable
cycle.

Election Year Pattern
Yale Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (www.stocktradersalmanac.com), has com-
piled statistics on the four-year U.S. presidential election cycle and broken it down into the char-
acteristics that have occurred each year for the period that a president is in office. Since 1832, the
market has risen a total of 557% during the last two years of each administration and only 81%
during the first two years. This amounts to an average of 13.6% per year for each of the last two
years of an administration and only 2.0% for each of the first two years. Indeed, since 1965, none

of the 13 major lows occurred in the fourth year of a presidency, and more than half (9) occurred
in the second year. Hirsh’s presumption is that the incumbent party wants to appear in a favorable
light during the last two years, and especially in the last year of an administration, in order to be
reelected. To do this, aside from providing the normal “spin” about their accomplishments, they
force interest rates lower and stimulate the economy. At least, history shows that interest rates are
inversely correlated with the stock market during those latter two years. How the administration
in power can force them lower is subject to conjecture.
In any case, this is a reasonable and relatively consistent pattern. Some would argue that it
is confusing “cause” with “correlation” and that there may not be a direct causal link between
politics and the stock market. Such an argument can be made about many occurrences in nature
and in man that appear to cause the stock market to react. The human mind often requires an
explanation for stock market behavior. It will invent causal relationships where they do not exist.
This mental tendency is something for the technical analyst to be mindful of and is the primary
reason that concentration always should be focused on price action rather than on speculating
about what might or might not be the cause for its behavior.

Seasonal Patterns
A seasonal pattern in agricultural prices has been known for centuries. More recently, interest
rates have followed a seasonal pattern as money was borrowed for seed and returned when the
crops were gathered. It turns out that seasonality exists in almost all economic statistics, and

Economic Research, The Conference Board, and many others, adjust their numbers for seasonal-
ity. Technical analysts sometimes frown upon this practice because it distorts real figures with
adjusted figures. However, it is an admission that seasonality is an important factor in economic
statistics and that the earth’s tilt and travel around its orbit have a substantial effect on prices,
markets, and economic activity.
The U.S. Treasury Bond market has seasonal tendencies. In Figure 9.6, the performance by
month of Treasury Bonds is averaged to show that the latter part of the year is the strongest
period for the bond market, whereas the winter through spring is the weakest. This means that
long-term interest rates, which travel inversely to bond prices, will tend to decline in the summer
and fall and rise in the winter and spring.

FIGURE 9.6 Seasonal cycles in Treasury Bonds (February 1965–June 2010)
In the commodity markets, such products as corn, hogs, and oil are those most affected by
seasonality. However, changes are occurring in the seasonality in the agricultural sector because
many food products are now produced in and shipped from the southern hemisphere in the “off-
season.” However, “seasonal” does not mean that from a trading or investment standpoint, a
position should be held for many months. In oil, for example, since 1983, the best performance
months are July through September, and the weakest is usually October (“Futures Insight: Crude
Oil,” Active Trader Magazine, July 2004, p 70). In orange juice contracts, for example, a sea-
sonal trade for 35 years has been 74% profitable for short trades initiated on June 4 and closed on

July 1 (Momsen, 2004). Almost all commodity and stocks have seasonal components that once
recognized can be profitable. This is called “entry date/exit date” trading. Price action at or near
each date should be analyzed closely because dates are only arbitrary, but once a seasonal pattern
is recognized, with proper discipline and observation, it can be very profitable over time.
“Sell in May and go away” (usually until October 1) refers to the tendency for the stock
market to decline from May to September and rise from October to April. In the past ten years,
August and September have been the worst months for performance, and October, November,
and January have the best gains, with another small rise in April. According to this model, May
is the month to sell, and August is the month to start looking for a bottom. This model has been
very consistent. Notice in Table 9.2 that 17 out of 30, or 57%, of the four-year cycle bottoms
occurred in September, October, November, or December. Only one peak occurred in October
since 1896. Only one peak occurred in August and only four in September. No peaks have
occurred in January. In other words, in stock prices, there seems to be a downward bias in the late
spring and summer and an upward bias in the late fall and winter. In a study by Active Trader
Magazine (“May-October System, The Trading System Lab,” Active Trader Magazine, July
2003, p 42), the results of buying on October 1 and selling short on May 15 for ten years, Janu-
ary 1993 through March 2003, showed excellent results. The only problem was the occurrence of
large drawdowns on the short side during the speculative bubble in 1997 and 1998. The recovery
from such drawdowns was quick, however, and the possibility of another speculative bubble in ptg
the immediate future is remote. Thus, this simple seasonal system seems to have merit, even if it
is only used as a guide as to when to be aggressive and when to be cautious.
JANUARY SIGNALS
January Barometer
“As the Standard & Poor’s goes in January, so goes the year” is a basic contention proposed by
the Hirsch’s of Stock Trader’s Almanac. Statistical problems arise with this indicator, despite its
popularity. First, if January is up, for example, the year starts with an advance and already has a
leg up. Second, because the stock market has had a positive bias over the years, January usually
is up as is the market for the year. When the periods and odds are broken down, the predictive
value of the January barometer comes within normal statistical probabilities and is without pre-
dictive value.
January Effect
The January effect was a condition that lasted for many years. During January, small-cap stocks
had a tendency to have abnormal strength. Although some analysts attributed this effect to
investors timing trades for tax reasons in December and January, no one could explain why the
January effect occurred in the magnitude it did. As a result, it became the darling of anti-random-
walk theorists as an example of how the market can establish patterns that are profitable. In

Chapter 9 Temporal Patterns and Cycles 175
recent years, however, the January effect has not worked very well. Some say it has been arbi-
traged out of business.
EVENTS
Short-term traders sometimes practice what is called event trading. This is when either a news
announcement is due, a surprise news announcement occurs, or a holiday is soon to occur. Holi-
days are seasonal and, thus, included here.
The major holidays during the year have shown to have recurring patterns. For example,
some analysts have observed an Independence Day pattern. Stock market performance tends to
be the strongest five days prior to Independence Day. Diminishing average performance gener-
ally occurs the five days following Independence Day. The sixth day after Independence Day is
associated with very strong stock market performance. Another example of a holiday pattern is
that the two weeks before Thanksgiving seem always to be positive. However, as we have seen in
the “Seasonal Patterns” section, November is generally one of the strongest months anyway.
Thus, when we deduct for November’s habitual strength, the pre-Thanksgiving strength becomes
more random and less useful. Is this type of information useful to the individual trader? The
ptg
answer is up to the individual trader. In most cases, the observed pattern is well within expected
statistically random results and is, thus, not helpful.
Another often-heard rule of thumb is to “Buy stocks on Monday and sell stocks on Friday.”
However, monthly, weekly, and daily patterns have the same statistical problems as holidays.
Any observed patterns, once adjusted for underlying trend and for randomness, show little in the
way of consistent return. Testing any simple trading rule that has been popularized in current
market conditions is important. In a recent study, Dahlquist (“Blue Monday Goes Green,” Active
Trader Magazine, November 2009, p 28) finds a striking deterioration in the statistical signifi-
cance and profitability of this trading strategy over the past three decades. In recent years, there
is no evidence that Monday returns are any different from any other day of the week.
CONCLUSION
Although the statistical methods demonstrating some of the temporal patterns are flawed, several
appear to have some merit. Though not something to depend strictly upon, they are consistent
enough to be considered when timing long-term investments. These are the long-term Kondrati-
eff cycle, the alternating 17-year cycle of dormancy and intensity, the 4-year cycle, and the sea-
sonal cycle. Each has been relatively reliable, statistically sound, with some generous and
occasional adjustments, and if applied mechanically have produced substantial results. The other
cycles and patterns may occasionally prove to have merit, but the technical analyst should
approach their use with great caution.

REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Consider K-wave cycle theory, 34-year cycle theory, and the relationship between
birthrates and the stock market. Plot on a timeline what each of these theories suggests
stock market performance will be over the next 50 years. Do the predictions tend to agree
and reinforce each other, or do they tend to contradict each other?
2. Consider the four-year cycle. Plot out the pattern this theory would suggest for the stock
market over the next ten years. How well does your plot match what the decennial pattern
theory would suggest would be positive years for stock returns?
3. Rosa said that over the past three years, she has invested all of her money in an S&P 500
index fund on October 1 and sold the fund 7 1/2 months later on May 15, remaining out of
the market until the next October 1. Why do you think Rosa followed this strategy? How
well has Rosa done following this strategy over the past three years?
4. Calculate the monthly rate of return in the S&P 500 for the past two years. What about
your results is in line with what you would have predicted given the information about sea-
sonality in this chapter? What about your results seems to be contrary to the seasonality
theory in this chapter? ptg

Thus far, we have covered four of the five necessary ingredients for making a reasonable assess-
ment of the market’s future direction. We have looked at the primary trend, as defined in the Dow
Theory; at sentiment, to see how different types of investors are thinking and acting; at market
indicators, as confirmation of or divergence from the trend; at seasonality; and at other temporal
tendencies. In this chapter, we look at the fifth ingredient. Our focus is on what propels markets
in one direction or the other—money, traditionally called the “flow of funds.”
For supply and demand to work in any market, money must be available. Money is both the
fuel and the lubricant that facilitates transactions. Bartering for stock shares would be ponderous
and unwieldy. When money is unavailable or expensive, the supply of stock available for sale
increases as investors sell their stocks to raise funds for other purposes. When money is available
and relatively inexpensive, it is available for investment in the markets. Accessible money does
not necessarily imply a strong market because the available money may be invested elsewhere or
just put under a mattress. However, available money seeks the most attractive return, and if the
markets are advancing, as confidence in the markets builds, more money is funneled into the
markets. Finally, if money is limited or becomes excessively expensive, the stock market has the
conditions for a decline.
We will look at four major topics in our study of the flow of funds. First, we look at the
money that is available and can be measured internally within the financial marketplace, such as

money market funds, margin debt, and secondary offerings. Second, we look at the availability
of funds not currently invested within the financial markets, such as household liquid assets, liq-
uidity, money supply, and loan demand, including consumer credit. Third, we focus on the cost
of funds, looking at short-term interest rates like the fed funds rate and the prime rate and long-
term interest rates in the bond market. Fourth, we consider the important influence that Federal
Reserve policy has on all of these variables.
As we look at the indicators in this chapter, you will see that many conventional signals
turned out to be incorrect or were outweighed by other indicators during the speculative bubble
from 1998 to 2000 and the subsequent collapse between 2000 and 2002, and again during the
stock market advance into 2008 and the subsequent collapse to new lows in 2009. Interestingly,
it appears that flow of funds signals work poorly during such emotional times, presumably
because stock prices appear to divorce themselves from economics. However, now that the spec-
ulative period is over, the flow of funds signals may return to favor and should not be ignored just
because of their shortcomings during that earlier period. After all, the flow of funds indicators
have a history and a logical reason for existence that goes back 50 to 60 years. Their recent fail-
ures are more likely due to an anomaly than to a permanent change in the relationship of money
and the stock market.

FUNDS IN THE MARKETPLACE
Let’s begin by looking at the money that is available within the financial marketplace. Two of the
topics we consider, money market funds and margin debt, measure the amount of funds available
within the market to flow toward additional stock purchases. The third topic we consider is sec-
ondary offerings; secondary offerings represent increased stock supply to which investor money
might flow.
Money Market Funds
When aggressive investors or traders become nervous about the stock market, they usually sell
stocks and place the funds into money market mutual funds. The amount of money market fund
assets is, therefore, a potential source of funds for reinvestment into the stock market. Because
investors and traders also tend to be wrong at market extremes, the level of money fund assets
can be a contrary opinion sentiment indicator.
One method of looking at the relationship between assets in money market funds and the
stock market is shown in Figure 10.1. It shows that when money market mutual fund assets
exceed 10.8% of Ned Davis Research total market value, on average the market advanced
approximately 10.5% per annum. This is reliable when the figure is first recorded at 10.8%. Con-
versely, when the percentage declines to below 10.8%, the stock market has a tendency to decline
12.5% as less money is available and investors are excessively optimistic. This indicator does not
give actual buy and sell signals because it shows only the liquidity or illiquidity available to the
stock market. It shows the conditions existing that may have an effect on the stock market but is
not a mechanical signal generator. Just because there is money in money market mutual funds

does not necessarily imply that the money will eventually flow into the stock market. The indica-
tor states only that such money is available for commitment somewhere, perhaps in the stock
market.

Margin Debt
Margin debt, the amount of funds that customers at brokerage houses borrow for commitments
in stocks, has historically been considered a sentiment indicator. The theory was that when mar-

and traders, who began to trade on margin, the market was near a top. Although this relationship
might still be partially true, margin debt as an all-encompassing figure of investor debt might
have become obsolete. Today’s speculator, instead of borrowing from his brokerage firm, can
purchase and sell various highly leveraged derivatives such as options and futures that avoid
being reported to the exchanges as margin debt. Thus, the market debt figures may be changing,
and certainly an indicator based on them should continually be adjusted.
One way of looking at margin debt is shown in Figure 10.2. It uses a 15-month rate of
change as the indicator of margin debt excess. When, over this period, the indicator crosses

Eighteen months after a buy signal, the stock market has advanced on average 47.2%, and on sell
signals it only advanced 2.0%. This has worked well in the period from 1970 through 2010, but
potential change in the parameters must be considered for the future.

Secondary Offerings
The number of secondary offerings is a sign of increasing supply of stock being sold on the mar-
ket. A secondary offering is the offering of additional shares of stock in a company that is already
publicly traded, as opposed to a primary offering which occurs when stock in a newly publicly
traded company is offered. This is usually a bearish sign for two reasons. First, it is a sign that
more supply is coming into the marketplace, soaking up available funds. Following the basic
principles of economics, as the supply of stock increases, the price of stock will fall. Second, the
sellers, usually insiders, are liquidating. These insiders will try to sell stock at times when they
think the price is relatively high. Thus, an increase in public offerings is directly related to sup-
ply and demand for stock and is also a sentiment indicator.

Ned Davis Research uses the number of offerings rather than the dollar amount so that the
figures are not dominated by only a few huge offerings. The number relates more to the broad-
ness of the tendency to sell out than to the actual money being soaked up, making it a more reli-
able figure of broad insider sentiment. They have found that when the 5-month moving average
of the number of secondary offerings exceeds its 45-month moving average by 147, the stock
market only advances another 1.0%. When the short average deviates from the long average by
only 109 or less, the market advances 12.9% per annum (see Figure 10.3).

FUNDS OUTSIDE THE SECURITY MARKET
Funds that are currently in the financial market are undoubtedly important, but the availability of
funds outside the financial market also plays an important role in determining market conditions.
The value of and the liquidity of household financial assets are important considerations when
measuring how much money households might move into the security market. Money supply
measures and bank loan activity are also important when considering how much money might
flow into the financial markets.

182 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
Household Financial Assets
Households, like corporations and governments, have different kinds of assets. They have both
physical assets, such as cars and houses, as well as financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual
funds, and banking accounts. Some of their financial assets are liquid and some are not. Liquid
assets can be converted to cash quickly; cash, bank deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S.
Treasury bonds, notes, and bills are liquid financial assets. Other financial assets cannot always
be converted to cash quickly; stocks generally are considered to be more liquid than other finan-
cial assets, such as pension funds, retirement accounts, profit-sharing accounts, unincorporated
business ownership, trusts, mortgages, and life insurance.
A ratio of liquid financial assets to total assets shows how “liquid” households are—in
other words, how easily they can raise cash if they need it. Generally, the more liquid households
are, the more able they are to invest in stocks. When household liquidity is high, it is, therefore,
favorable for the stock market, whereas low liquidity is negative for the stock market.
The data presented in Figure 10.4 shows a substantial decline in household liquidity in the
1990s. This is one reason why consumer debt rose so strongly and why households were unable
to withstand the severe economic contraction. During severe economic contractions, one major
source of funds for cash-strapped households is the stock market. Thus, this indicator, although
ptg
it does not give mechanical signals, does measure the potential funds for stock demand or supply.

Money Supply
Expansion in the money supply is a measure of potential demand for stock, as well as other
assets, and is, thus, a rough measure of the potential for business and stock market expansion.
Increases in the money supply have been historically associated with increases in economic
growth and productivity. Although this economic theory is straightforward, quantifying actual
money supply growth is not as easy as it seems. Measuring the amount of money in the economy
depends upon knowing what money is. If I ask you how much money you have, you would cer-
tainly count the currency and coins in your wallet. However, you would also probably think
about the money you have in your checking account. Then, there is also the money you have in a
savings account or money market mutual fund. Thus, the definition of money, and what to
include in a measurement of money, is not as straightforward as it would initially seem.
The Federal Reserve measures money supply in a number of ways. Table 10.1 shows the
various measurements of money that the Federal Reserve uses. The categories are based on liq-
uidity, or the ease in which the financial assets can be converted into cash.

M1, the narrowest definition of money, is a measure of the most liquid assets in the finan-
cial system. It includes currency and the various deposit accounts on which individuals can write
checks. M2 is a slightly broader measure of money, which includes various forms of savings
accounts. The additional components of M2 are slightly less liquid than the financial assets of
M1. Today, the most commonly quoted monetary aggregate is M2 because its movements appear
to be most closely related to interest rates and economic growth.
When M2 is measured relative to the total market value of stocks, it tells us the percentage
of money available outside the stock market. A high percentage, then, tells us that there is plenty
of money around to go into the stock market and is, thus, an indicator of potential funds for
stocks. Ned Davis Research has found that when this ratio exceeds 143, the amount of money
available is large, and, consequently, the stock market tends to rise on average 13.0% per year

Bank Loans
Generally, an increase in loan activity, the amount of loans being created and existing, is a sign
of increased business activity. It can also be a sign of increased speculation and/or a particular
period when banks, because the yield curve is so much in their favor, become less prudent in
their lending policies. When loan demand increases, it puts upward pressure on interest rates.
Conversely, a decrease in loan demand puts downward pressure on interest rates.
The growth and contraction of bank loans has a bearing on interest rates and on the stock
market. As shown in Figure 10.6, Ned Davis Research found that since 1948, a year-to-year rise
in bank loans (and leases) greater than 13% indicated an overheated economy and a high likeli-
hood of a stock market decline. When bank loans only expanded at 5.5% or lower, the economy
was healthier, and the stock market rose on average 11.5% per year on average.

FIGURE 10.6 Bank loans and the S&P 500 (January 1948–May 2010)
THE COST OF FUNDS
The interest rate represents the price of borrowing funds. It is the cost that borrowers have to pay
to use money; the higher the price, the less likely borrowers are to borrow. It is also the reward
that lenders receive for letting someone borrow their money; investors compare this return with
the expected return in other markets, such as the stock market, when they decide where to allo-
cate their funds.
Short-Term Interest Rates
The theory behind using short-term interest rates as stock market signals is based on two
assumptions. First, interest-bearing investments are alternatives to stock investments. In other
words, savers make choices about placing their investment funds in interest-bearing securities or
the stock market. When interest rates are relatively high, the interest-bearing securities look rel-
atively more enticing. Second, interest rates directly affect costs for corporations and, thus, cor-
porate earnings. However, the interest rate itself is important because the expected rate of return
in the stock market must be greater than the short-term interest rate for investors to invest. When

186 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
interest rates begin to rise, while the stock market languishes, investment outlooks begin to
change. On the corporate and personal level, rising rates translate into rising costs. Whether it is
working capital borrowing or adjustable rate mortgage payments, increases in short-term rates
have a negative effect on net income and, by extension, on confidence. Alternatively, when rates
decline, costs also decline and confidence builds. Furthermore, and regardless of potential rea-
sons, short-term interest rates correlate very closely but inversely with stock market behavior. To
know when a major switch in direction in short-term interest rates has occurred is important
knowledge as to a probable switch in stock market direction.
Federal Reserve policy indicators and short-term interest rates are generally very accurate,
though often early, as a predictor of stock market direction. Figure 10.7 shows the relationship
between short-term interest rate movements and the S&P500. During the speculative bubble in
1998 to 2000 and its collapse into 2002, however, interest rates had little effect upon the market’s
direction. Emotion had overcome logic, and the relationship between short-term interest rates
and the market was abandoned for greed to make easy money and fear of missing the next
upward wave in stock prices. Again, in the period between 2007 and 2009, when the stock mar-
ket collapsed to a new 10-year low, lower short-term interest rates had no positive effect on the
stock market. Financial jargon calls this behavior “pushing on a string,” when short-term rates do
not cause incentives to buy stocks. The last time rates did not work was in the 1920s speculative ptg
bubble and early 1930s collapse. They were reliable for more than 50 years thereafter.

Long-Term Interest Rates (or Inversely, the Bond Market)
Long-term interest rates are related to, but not perfectly correlated to, short-term interest rates.
The Federal Reserve effectively controls short-term interest rates through its various policy
measures, but it does not have as tight control of the long-term market. When we speak of long-
term interest rates, we speak of the bond market. Long-term interest rates and bond prices are
inversely related. When long-term interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and when long-term inter-
est rates fall, bond prices rise.
Relationships between the bond market (or long-term interest rates) and the stock market
also exist. The relationships between bonds and stocks have much to do with the payout for secu-
rity holders, coupon payments for bondholders, and dividends for stockholders. Generally,
investors view bonds as long-term investments with a steady, fixed coupon return, whereas
stocks are long-term investments with a variable, less-predictable return. Both markets, however,
can fluctuate widely.
For long-term outlooks (as opposed to long-term interest rates), therefore, it is important to
know the historical relationship between these investments. As a rule, long-term bonds have
tended to move in the same direction as the stock market. In other words, long-term interest rates
have tended to move in the opposite direction from the stock market. As the bond market makes
ptg
a major bottom, the stock market often makes a major bottom also. At tops, the bond market
tends to lead the stock market and is, thus, very often, an early indicator of trouble ahead for the
stock market. As in short-term interest rates, this relationship broke down during the period of
the speculative bubble and collapse between 1998 and 2002 and between 2007 and 2009. Prior to
those periods, the relationship had been steady for over 50 years and will likely return. See Fig-
ure 10.8 for the relationship between long-term Treasury bond yields and the S&P500 over the
past 40 years.
Ned Davis Research developed a simple trading rule for long-term interest rates. It is the
amount of points a three-week moving average changes, up or down. If the long-rate measure
declines by 8.7% from a weekly peak, a buy signal is generated. On the other hand, a sell signal
is generated when the long-term rate average advances 11.7% from a weekly low. The perform-
ance history of this simple method produced an average annual return of 9.9% in the S&P 500
over the past 45 years. This is compared with a buy-and-hold gain of only 5.7%.
Money Velocity
The velocity of money is a measure of how fast money turns over in the economy. It is calculated
as a ratio of personal income to M2. Historically, money velocity is related to inflation, as the
faster money circulates, the more pressure exists on prices, and as a leading indicator of long-
term interest rates, again because it reflects inflationary pressure. In terms of being an indicator
for the stock market, Ned Davis Research has found that when money velocity (a monthly figure)
rises above its 13-month moving average, the stock market has advanced 3.4% per annum on
average. When money velocity declines below its 13-month moving average, the stock market

Misery Index
The economist Arthur Okum designed the Misery Index in the 1960s during the Johnson admin-
istration when inflation was a special concern. Inflation, coupled with high unemployment,
resulted in what economists call stagflation. Okum created the index in an attempt to measure
the social and economic cost of high inflation and high unemployment. A high Misery Index
indicated that the combination of inflation and unemployment was high and that investors were
experiencing a more stressful economic environment.

FIGURE 10.9 Money velocity (June 1962–May 2010)
The Misery Index is a universal index that can be calculated for any country by simply
summing the country’s inflation and unemployment rates together. The original Misery Index
has been modified to create the American Misery Index. The American Misery Index is calcu-
lated by adding the inflation, unemployment, and interest rates. Figure 10.10 shows how the
level of the American Misery Index has related to the performance of the DJIA since 1966. This
figure shows the results of buying the DJIA whenever the American Misery Index falls by 0.3
points and selling the DJIA whenever the index rises by 3.2 points. The trading accuracy of this
system is 75% favorable, and its gain per annum is greater than the buy-and-hold gain per annum
by over 4%. Because the calculation of the Misery Index is easy and low-cost, the profitable
results of this trading system appear valuable.

FIGURE 10.10 The Misery Index and the DJIA (December 1966–June 2010)
FED POLICY
The Federal Reserve System (www.federalreserve.gov), often referred to as “the Fed,” is the
independent federal organization that determines and implements monetary policy for the United
States. The Federal Reserve’s policy regarding the money supply is the principal determinant of
short-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has three main tools for adjusting the money sup-
ply: changing the amount of reserves that banks are required to hold, changing the discount rate,
and buying and selling U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities through its open market oper-
ations. The third tool (open market operations) is the one that the Fed most often uses.
When the Federal Reserve purchases securities, it adds money to the banking system. Because
banks then have more cash in reserve, they are more likely to make loans, and interest rates tend to
fall. Another way to look at this relationship is that the Fed’s purchase of bills represents increased
demand for bills. As the demand for bills rises, bill prices rise and short-term interest rates decline.
Fed selling of government securities has exactly the opposite impact. As money is used to
pay for these securities, reserves are drained from the banking system. When there is less money
in the banking system, banks can make fewer loans, and interest rates tend to rise. Fed selling of
government securities represents an increased supply of securities in the marketplace, and, thus,
the price of these securities falls. As bill prices fall, interest rates rise.
The Fed uses open market operations to reach a federal funds rate target. The federal funds
rate is the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other. Although the federal funds rate is

Chapter 10 Flow of Funds 191
not set by the Federal Reserve, Fed action greatly impacts this rate. If the Federal Reserve makes
open market purchases, banks will have more money in reserve. Fewer banks will need to borrow
reserves from other banks, and more banks will have excess reserves that they want to lend. This,
in turn, places downward pressure on the federal funds rate. When the Fed sells securities, bank
reserves decrease, and as bank reserves decline, more banks want to borrow and fewer banks
want to lend in the federal funds market. Thus, the federal funds rate will rise.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets about every six weeks. At these meet-
ings, the FOMC establishes a federal funds target rate. Although the minutes of each FOMC meet-
ing are not made available to the general public until three weeks after the meeting, the FOMC
announces its federal funds target rate at the conclusion of the meeting. By implication, this fed-
eral funds rate target tells the public whether the Federal Reserve is pursuing a restrictive or
expansionist policy. Because short-term interest rates are so important to business and the stock
market, and because the Federal Reserve has such a large impact on short-term interest rates, it is
important for the analyst to be aware of Fed policy and the subtle changes in that policy.
Fed Policy Futures
The FOMC meets in private and only provides a brief announcement about its strategy immedi- ptg
ately following its meeting. Because a change in Fed policy can have a significant impact on the
financial markets, people try to anticipate and predict Fed policy changes. The faculty at The
University of Iowa Tippie College of Business operate a small-scale (maximum investment of
$500) futures market known as the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM; www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/
markets/fedpolicyb.html). One of the IEM markets is on the prospects for the Federal Reserve to
change the federal funds target rate at their next several scheduled meetings. As seen in Figure
10.11, this futures market has been very reliable in predicting, up to a month or more before, the
direction of Federal Reserve policy with respect to the direction of its target rates.

192 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
The Federal Reserve Valuation Model
Even though the Federal Reserve is in charge of monetary policy and is concerned with the over-
all health of the economy and the financial markets, the Federal Reserve seldom makes direct
comments about the health of the stock market. However, economist Ed Yardeni
(www.yardeni.com), in the back pages of a Fed report, discovered the Greenspan Model, also
known as the Fed’s Stock Valuation Model. As shown in Figure 10.12, this model gives a general
indication of whether the Federal Reserve sees the stock market as overvalued or undervalued. It
is a valuation model that determines if the stock market is too high or low based on the stock
market earnings yield relative to yield on the ten-year U.S. note. Although this is an extremely
easy-to-calculate indicator of general market value, there are several criticisms of this model.
The principal criticisms of the model are that (1) it is too simplistic, (2) a better correlation exists
between actual reported earnings than estimated earnings, and (3) it doesn’t include inflation, an
important factor in determining long-term interest rates.

Chapter 10 Flow of Funds 193
Three Steps and a Stumble
In line with the desire to measure when the Federal Reserve is tightening credit, Edson Gould, a
legendary technical analyst from the 1930s through the 1970s, developed a simple rule about
Federal Reserve policy that has an excellent record of foretelling a stock market decline. The
rules states that “whenever the Federal Reserve raises either the federal funds target rate, margin
requirements, or reserve requirements three consecutive times without a decline, the stock mar-
ket is likely to suffer a substantial, perhaps serious, setback” (Schade, 2004, p. 68). This simple
rule is still relevant. Although it tends to lead a market top, it is something that should not be dis-
regarded. As shown in Figure 10.13, the rule has been followed by a median decline of 17%.
Only two possible incorrect signals were given since 1915: The 1928 signal, prior to the 1929
crash, was possibly too early, and the 1978 signal was probably too late. Thus, this signal has an
accuracy record of at least 87.5%.

FIGURE 10.13 Two Tumbles and a Jump (January 1915–July 2010)
The Two Tumbles and a Jump indicator was first mentioned in Fosback’s 1973 edition of
Market Logic. It is essentially the opposite of Gould’s Three-Steps rule. Although it uses
changes in the Federal Reserve funds target rate, margin requirements, and reserve requirements,
it looks for two consecutive declines, or tumbles, in any of these policy variables. It has an excel-
lent history of predicting the stock market rises. As Figure 10.13 demonstrates, the percentage of
accuracy since 1915 is 84%, with some of the errors considered questionable.

194 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
One way to use these two interest rate indicators, which the evidence shows to be superior, is
to take them as warnings of important changes in market direction. They are not necessarily strict
signals by themselves. However, if direction action is taken based on one of them, a reversal in direc-
tion from the signal direction would be signaled if the market exceeded its earlier high or low. Thus,
if the Three-Steps rule gives a sell signal and the market begins to decline, a buy signal would be
generated if either the market broke above its earlier highs or a Two-Tumble signal occurred. The
same protection could be used for the Two-Tumble rule in the opposite direction. Essentially, these
are “stops” that would prevent any major loss from future incorrect signals, rare as they may be.
Yield Curve
The yield curve is a graphical relationship of the yield on bonds with various lengths of time to
maturity. Yield curve information is often summarized as a ratio or difference between a short-
term and long-term interest rate over time. Figure 10.14 shows the difference between the three-
month Treasury bill rate and the 30-year Treasury bond yield from 1948 through mid-2010.
Banks traditionally practice maturity intermediation, borrowing short-term funds and lend-
ing to corporations or individuals over longer periods. Thus, they are said to “borrow short, and
lend long.” Their profit depends on the spread between the cost of funds, the short-term interest ptg
rate, and the return from loaned funds, the long-term interest rate. As short-term interest rates
rise, presumably from Federal Reserve policy action and long-term interest rates remain steady
or decline, the yield curve becomes flatter and the banks are unable to profit as much from the
spread. The yield curve, therefore, is a crude measurement of bank potential profitability. Bank
profitability affects interest rates, and interest rates affect the stock market. Thus, the yield curve
is a forecaster of stock market direction, and, historically, it has had an acceptable record of
anticipating major turns in the stock market.
The “normal” relationship between interest-bearing instruments of the same quality is for
longer rates to be higher than shorter rates. This is presumably because over time there is a risk of
inflation, default, and other economic problems, the risk of which the holder of the long-term
interest rate instrument wants to be compensated. This results in a positively sloped yield curve
when plotting a graph with the time to maturity on the horizontal axis and the interest rate on the
vertical axis for these securities.
The yield curve becomes abnormally steep when long-term rates rise considerably higher
relative to short-term rates than the historic average of around 200 basis points. Although this can
occur because of upward movement in the long-term rate or downward movement in the short-
term rate, it is usually caused by the Fed lowering short-term rates to expand economic activity.
At times, short-term interest rates rise above long-term interest rates and the yield curve
becomes inverted. This yield curve usually has dire consequences for the economy because it
curtails the incentive of banks and other lending institutions that borrow money at short-term
rates to make loans at long-term rates. The Federal Reserve estimates that an inverted yield
curve predicts recessions two to six quarters ahead. Figure 10.14 shows the history of the yield
curve and how it tends to forecast the direction of the stock market. Ned Davis Research found
that when the long-rates advanced 1.1 percentage points above short-rates, the stock market
advanced 10.8% per annum on average. Contrarily, when the yield curve inverted, the stock mar-
ket declined on average 7.2% per annum.

CONCLUSION
Flow of funds indicators, with the exception of the time during the speculative bubble from 1998
through its collapse in 2002, are a good means of assessing the available funds for investment.
We have looked at some indicators of funds within the marketplace, from outside the market-
place, and their interest rates. The most reliable signals seem to come from interest rates. Some
technical analysts believe that the study of the flow of funds is best left to quantitative analysts or
quants, who closely follow the historic relationships between equities and fixed income securi-
ties. It may be many years for even those who subscribe to the flow of funds concept to believe
in their monetary indicators after the experience of the late 1990s and early 2000s period.

196 Part II Markets and Market Indicators
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Explain how the amount of money in money market mutual funds can be a predictor of
stock market performance. Calculate the ratio of money market mutual fund assets to the
Wiltshire 5000 Index using the most recent statistics available. (Money market mutual
fund asset statistics are included in the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Report Z.1 in Chart
L.122, available electronically at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/.) What does this ratio
suggest about future stock market performance?
2. Why would many public offerings occur at market tops (and few at market bottoms)?
3. Why might household liquidity be related to stock market performance?
4. What has happened to the federal funds target rate over the past year? What does this sug-
gest about stock market performance?
5. Determine the shape of the yield curve during the 2006–2007 time period. You can gather
information to construct the yield curve from the Federal Reserve Web site. Alternatively,
many Web sites, such as stockcharts.com (http://stockcharts.com/charts/YieldCurve.html),
ptg
provide pictures of historical yield curves. Looking at this yield curve, do you think that
the weak economic conditions and market downturn that began in the fall of 2008 were a
surprise to an alert observer?
6. Gather data for the yield curve this week and for the yield curve one year ago. What
changes do you notice? What impact do you think this will have on the stock market?

A chart is like a cat’s whiskers. A cat’s whiskers tell the cat which way the mouse
will turn and thus which way to pounce. The mouse doesn’t think about which way
it will turn, but the cat must anticipate that direction. Likewise, the market doesn’t
know which way it will turn, but the speculator must anticipate that turn regardless.
He uses a chart as his whiskers. (Sieki Shimizu, 1986)
A chart is the traditional tool of the technical analyst. Charts are merely graphical displays of data.
Many chart varieties have evolved over the centuries, but the basic principle of graphing price and
other important information is the cornerstone of technical analysis. Indeed, in many countries,
technical analysts are still called “chartists,” even though hand-drawn charts have become some-
what antiquated because computers display and, in some programs, analyze the price data more
quickly and efficiently. Nevertheless, some specialists, floor traders, market makers, and technical
analysis departments for brokerage and management firms still maintain hand-drawn charts. These
analysts believe that by drawing a chart, rather than allowing a computer to draw a chart or a pub-
lishing service to deliver a chart, the fine points of price changes, trends, and patterns become more
visible. By taking the time and effort to draw each day’s activity, a personal “feeling” for the price
action develops that is more intimate than that gained from a mechanical drawing.

200 Part III Trend Analysis
From these charts, technical analysts recognize patterns and trends that can be useful in
trading and investing. Of course, the chart method is also subject to considerable criticism
largely because the recognition of patterns and trends is subjective, based on the analyst’s skill
and experience. These human attributes are difficult to quantify and, thus, difficult to test.
Interestingly, a recent, unpublished study by Hasanhodzic, Lo, and Viola (2010) showed that
humans, when confronted with graphic data in a “video game” format, can “distinguish between
actual financial returns from random temporal permutations of those returns.” They found “over-
whelming statistical evidence (p-values no greater than 0.5%) that subjects can consistently distin-
guish between the two types of time series, thereby refuting the widespread belief that financial
markets ‘look random.’A key feature of the experiment is that subjects are given immediate feed-
back regarding the validity of their choices, allowing them to learn and adapt” (p. 1).
Some analysts are now using pattern-recognition systems and other sophisticated computer-
ized methods, and early results have demonstrated that, indeed, many of the traditional chart patterns
have some predictive value. Charts have other uses, however, if only to quickly observe the history
of prices. The benefits of chart use outweigh the problems associated with their interpretation.

BOX 11.1 BENEFITS OF USING CHARTS
In his book, Technical Analysis, Jack Schwager (1996) outlines numerous benefits to
the investor of using charts. These benefits include the following:
• Charts provide a concise price history—an essential item of information for
any trader (or investor).
• Charts can provide the trader or investor with a good sense of the market’s
volatility—an important consideration in assessing risk.
• Charts can be a very useful tool to the fundamental analyst. Long-term price
charts enable the fundamentalist to isolate quickly the periods of major price
moves. By determining the fundamental conditions or events that were peculiar
to those periods, the fundamentalist can identify the key price-influencing fac-
tors. This information can then be used to construct a price behavior model.
• Charts can serve as a timing tool, even by traders who base their decisions
on other information (e.g., fundamentals).
• Charts can be used as a money management tool by helping to define mean-
ingful and realistic stop points.
• Charts reflect market behavior that is subject to certain repetitive patterns.
Given sufficient experience, some traders will uncover an innate ability to
use charts successfully as a method of anticipating price moves.
• An understanding of chart concepts is probably an essential prerequisite for
developing profitable technical trading systems.
• Cynics take notice: Under specific circumstances, a contrarian approach to
classical chart signals can lead to very profitable trading opportunities
(when those signals fail).

Chapter 11 History and Construction of Charts 201
HISTORY OF CHARTING
According to exhaustive research on technical analysis by Lo and Hasanhodzic (2010), the earli-
est known recording of commodity prices with the intent to predict from them was in ancient
Babylonia in the first millennium B.C. These recording were diaries of traders and astronomers
who were attempting to correlate astrology with price changes. By the fifth and sixth centuries
A.D., price charts, similar to those used presently, were developed in China, Europe, and Japan.
The Chinese were interested in cyclicality of prices; the Europeans were interested in astrology;
and the Japanese developed the candlestick chart that is still in use today. The “opening of com-
modity exchanges in Western Europe (1561) and Japan (1654) provided the necessary environ-
ment for the development of the chart” (Shimizu, 1986, p 14). At the time of these exchanges,
freely trading markets had become sophisticated enough to produce multiple prices during a
trading day and, thus, the requirement for recording the high, low, and close price of each com-
modity traded on the exchange. It was only natural that this information was portrayed in graphic
form. By the 1830s, just before the invention of the ticker tape for the stock exchanges, several
chart vendors in New York sold published charts on stock and commodity prices.
The information charted and the method of charting often flows from how the market
ptg
being analyzed operates. For example, the current use of high and low in a bar chart is not feasi-
ble in those trading markets that settle a price only once a day.
Plausibly, the first type of chart was just a simple plot on paper of a number, either amount
or price, and a date. In early Japan, for example, rice was traded by amount. Instead of a price per
bag, it was the number of bags per price that was recorded by the famous rice trader Sokyu
Honma in the 1750s. As markets began to trade more frequently during the day, the chart became
more complex. A high and low price could be recorded, and eventually as multiple trades
occurred, an open and close price could be added. Volume was recorded much later when more
complete and public records were available. At first, witnesses located in the marketplace
recorded prices. Eventually, markets became better organized, and prices and amounts were pub-
licly available.
The growth of this business is of great monument to the stock exchange, for it is
through the instant dissemination of the quotations made on its floor that the active
and continuous interest in the markets is sustained. (Horace L. Hotchkiss, founder of
the Gold Stock and Telegraph Company)
The invention of the ticker and the ticker tape revolutionized technical analysis and chart-
ing. Shortly after Thomas Edison invented a machine called the Edison Telegraph Printer to print
messages from a telegraph, in 1867 Edward A. Calahan, an employee of the American Telegraph
Company, invented the ticker tape. Eventually, it was improved upon and patented by Thomas
Edison in 1871. This invention not only made conventional charting easier but also allowed for
point-and-figure charting, because such charts required knowledge of every price at which an
item had traded during the day. Without the ticker tape, the gathering of this information would
have been difficult in markets with multiple trades during a day.

202 Part III Trend Analysis
BOX 11.2 WHAT IS A TICKER TAPE?
A tick is any change, up or down, in the price of a stock (or any other traded secu-
rity). Information regarding stock transactions is recorded on a ticker tape. By
watching the ticker tape, an investor is able to keep abreast of changes in stock
prices. The first ticker tape was developed in 1867, following the invention of the
telegraph machine. This technology allowed information to be printed in a shorthand
format on a narrow strip of paper, or tape. Messengers would run a circuit between
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) trading floor to brokers’ offices, delivering
tapes of the most recent transactions. Brokers would place an office near the NYSE
because the closer they were to the trading floor, the more quickly they could get
ticker tapes and the more up to date their information about recent stock transactions
would be. Technology improved over the years, providing faster access to stock
transaction data. In the hectic trading days of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
ticker could not keep up with trading, and there was a period when the markets were
closed on Wednesdays to facilitate the clearing of trades. Not until 1996 did the real-
time electronic ticker provide up-to-the-minute transaction data. Today, you will see
ptg
immediate stock market transaction figures on TV news shows and Web sites.
Although these figures are reported electronically, and the actual tape is no longer
used, the name “ticker tape” is still used when a running list of trades is shown on
TV or a quote machine.
When you are watching a ticker tape, you will see information recorded in a for-
mat such as:
HPQ2K@23.16 1.09
or
Ticker Symbol Shares Traded@Price Traded, Change Direction, Change Amount
The first information given is the ticker symbol; these unique characters identify a
particular company’s stock. In the preceding example, HPQ indicates that this infor-
mation is for the common stock of Hewlett-Packard Co. Next, the volume of shares
traded appears. 2K indicates that 2,000 shares were traded. The price per share for
the particular trade is then quoted. Next, an up or down triangle appears, indicating
whether this trading price is higher or lower than the previous day’s closing price.
Finally, the difference between the current trading price and the previous closing
price is reported. Reading this ticker tape, we can tell that 2,000 shares of Hewlett-
Packard stock just traded at $23.16 a share. We can also tell that this is $1.09 higher
than the previous day’s closing price of $22.07.
Modern technology has greatly simplified the task of chart construction. Computer power
has replaced much of the tedious human work. Now, even basic home computers have spreadsheet

programs, such as Microsoft Excel, that can store daily stock price data and create a variety of
charts used by technical analysts. In addition, other sophisticated software programs that are
specifically designed for technical analysis are readily available. These programs not only plot
charts and indicators or oscillators but also can test trading rules. Examples are TradeStation
(www.tradestation.com), Metastock (www.equis.com), High Growth Stock Investors
(www.hgsi.com), and Amibroker (www.amibroker.com). In addition to charting software, the
Web hosts many charting sites, examples of which are StockCharts.com, www.bigcharts.com,
finance.yahoo.com, and freestockcharts.com. Today, the technical analyst can focus much more
time and attention on analysis and much less on chart construction.
Over the years, technicians developed several different approaches to chart construction.
The four main categories of charting that we discuss in this chapter are line charts, bar charts,
candlestick charts, and point-and-figure charts. Each approach has its own features, benefits, and
drawbacks. Whichever method a technical analyst chooses to use, charts serve as the technical
analyst’s road map. Charts give a quick and concise picture of past price action.
For example, look at Table 11.1. This table contains the closing price for Alcoa for the
month of February 2010.

It is difficult to look at the 19 closing prices in this table and get an idea of whether the
stock price trend is up, down, or sideways. Now look at Figure 11.1.
This chart contains the same information as Table 11.1. Notice how much easier it is to
process the information when it is provided in the picture form of Figure 11.1 rather than in tab-
ular form. As the old saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” With just a glance at the
chart, you have a road map of where prices have been; in a fraction of a second, you can easily
spot the highest prices and lowest prices that occurred during the period. A chart quickly trans-
forms a table of data into a clear visual representation of the information.

WHAT DATA IS NEEDED TO CONSTRUCT A CHART?
To construct reliable charts, the technical analyst must be sure of the trustworthiness of the data.
During a normal trading day, many errors appear on the tape, from which most data originates,
that someone must screen out and adjust. Some trade reports show the wrong price or volume;
some trades are in error and must be broken; and some trades occur out of order. When a price
error occurs at a high or a low for the trading day, the error is especially troublesome because it

Chapter 11 History and Construction of Charts 205
affects daily calculations of averages and oscillators using highs and lows. It is, therefore, very
important that any data used for charting is extremely “clean” and reliable.
In addition to trading errors, other data errors can occur through stock splits, dividends,
offerings, and distributions. In the commodities markets, because contracts have a settlement
date at which trading halts, incorrect calculation of the time and price linkage between contracts
may affect longer-term technical patterns and trends. Calculation of these linkages into time
series data for a longer-term perspective is never precise. The results are called either “nearest
future,” “perpetual series,” or “continuous series” and are provided by many data vendors and
exchanges (see Box 11.3). There are other methods of joining the different contracts into a con-
tinuous series, but all have serious problems for the analyst wanting to test longer periods of data.
Schwager (1996) recommends the continuous contract as the best method for such tests.
BOX 11.3 LINKED CONTRACTS
For very short-term testing and analysis of futures contracts, you can use the actual
contract data. The test period must be extremely short, however, because the liquid
portion of any contract, the period when active trading occurs, is only a portion of ptg
the contract time span. Thus, the data available for realistic study is short, and to test
a number of signals, it must be separated at very short intervals.
Once the trading signal horizon exceeds an hour, however, one must calculate a
linked contract to provide sufficient data for testing. There are three basic types of
linked contracts: the nearest future, the perpetual, and the continuous. Each has its
advantages and disadvantages.
The nearest future method is just a plot of each futures contract as it expires and
is replaced by a new contract. Unfortunately, during the transition between old and
new contract, a gap always exists at the rollover into the new contract. Thus, this
method is useless for testing trading systems, even though the contracts plotted are
historically correct. It is the least preferable method of analyzing longer-term futures
price moves.
The perpetual contract (also known as the “constant-forward”), to avoid the near-
est future rollover problem, uses a constant forward price, namely the anticipated
price some specific period ahead. This forward contract comes from the interest and
foreign exchange markets where constant-forward contracts are traded. The adjust-
ment to the futures markets assumes a price that adjusts for the time between a con-
tract series that is current and one that is beyond the specific constant-forward
period. The perpetual price then is the price of the current contract and the forward
contract each weighted by the amount of time remaining in the hypothetical forward
period. Thus, the perpetual price avoids the problem of the rollover by smoothing the
two contract prices, one near and one far out, in a gradual manner as time progresses.
The problem with this method is that it is not real. The actual prices recorded in the
perpetual contract never occurred. It is, thus, not a suitable method for testing a tech-
nical trading system.

continued
The third method, the continuous contract, is more realistic but is useless for cal-
culating percentage changes over time. It adjusts for the premium difference
between the current contract prices—the price of the previous contract and the con-
tract into which the trader rolls his position at a specific rollover date, say 15 days
before expiration—to avoid the trading bias that occurs as the contract nears its end.
This continuous contract then carries the adjustment into the future. It reflects
exactly what would have occurred to a portfolio that invested in the first contract and
rolled over each contract at its rollover date. It is, thus, a realistic expression of the
history of the futures contract and can be used for testing past data. It has two prob-
lems, however. One is that because the adjustments are additive, it cannot be used for
percentage returns; and two, the ending price of the continuous contract is not the
same as the current price of the current contract. The continuous contract is the pri-
mary contract used for testing trading systems.

WHAT TYPES OF CHARTS DO ANALYSTS USE?
In early markets, when the price for a security or good might be established only once or twice a
day, the chart was extremely simple. It was merely a graph of closing prices connected by a line,
sometimes directly connected, and sometimes connected by perpendicular lines. In Japan, this
type of chart was called a “tome” chart from the word “tomene,” which means “close.” In the
Western world, this type of chart is still used and is called a “line” chart.
When trades became more frequent, chart forms took two paths. The first and still most
common style was borrowed from the bar graph or stick graph and portrayed the high and low
with a “floating” vertical line not connected to the base line. These were called bar charts or ver-
tical line charts. Interestingly, in Japan, where many chart types were developed, the original
plotting of price data was from right to left rather than the now-universal method of plotting from
left to right. This bar style then evolved into the candlestick chart, which uses the same informa-
tion as the bar chart but has a more appealing appearance to the eye. The other path was called
the price movement line, where prices were recorded as they occurred, and only the ones that
deviated from earlier prices by a specified amount were graphed in a line. This method of price
plotting is the forerunner to the modern point-and-figure chart.
Today, the three most common types of charts that record prices at given time intervals
(such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly) are line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. Let
us look at each of these charts and see how they differ.

Line Charts
Figure 11.2 is an example of a line chart. These simple charts provide information about two
variables, price and time. In Figure 11.2, the price variable is the daily closing price for AA
(Alcoa Corporation). A line chart has price data on the vertical, or y, axis. On the horizontal, or
x, axis it has a time measure (hours, days, weeks, etc.).
Simple line charts are especially useful when studying long-term trends. Because line
charts display summary statistics, they are often used when information about several different
variables is being plotted in the same graph. For example, in Figure 11.3, three line charts are
used to plot the daily close of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and NASDAQ for
the past four years. Journalists often use line charts to give the reader a quick, concise picture of
the variables being discussed.
Figure 11.3 represents daily data. Line charts, however, can be used to present data col-
lected at any time interval. More frequent data collection will lead to a more detailed, but more
cluttered, graphical presentation. Especially when studying long-term trends, these extra details
muddy the picture and obscure basic trends. For example, compare Figures 11.4, 11.5, and 11.6.
Each of these charts represents trading data for JNJ (Johnson & Johnson) over the four-year time
period from July 2006 through June 2010. The first chart uses daily data, the second chart dis-
ptg
plays weekly data, and the third chart presents monthly data. See how broader, longer-term
movements in the stock price are more easily discernable in the third graph, which relies on less-
frequent data observations.

210 Part III Trend Analysis
Bar Charts
Although the line chart visually displays one piece of information for each time interval, a bar
chart shows at least three pieces of information: the high, the low, and the closing price for each
time interval. Some bar charts also contain a fourth piece of price information, the opening price.
Each time interval (that is, day, week, or five-minutes) is represented by one bar.
Figure 11.7 is an example of a daily bar chart. Each bar represents one day’s price action.
Just as with the line chart, price data is placed on the vertical axis, and time is measured on the
horizontal axis. A vertical line shows the trading range for that day. The top of this vertical line
represents the highest price at which the security traded on that day; the bottom of the bar repre-
sents the lowest trading price of the day. A longer line denotes a wider trading range during the
day. Likewise, a short bar means that the spread between the highest price during the day and the
lowest price during the day was small. A small tick mark on the right side of the bar indicates the
closing price for the day. If the opening price for the day is recorded on the bar chart, it is repre-
sented by a small tick mark to the left side of the bar.

We see that the first bar in Figure 11.7 represents trading information for AA on March 31,
2010. The lowest point of the bar is 14.22, which is the lowest price that a share of AA traded for
on that day. The highest price anyone paid for a share of AA that day was $14.44, represented by
the top of the bar. The difference between the high and low price in any bar is called the range.
The opening price for AA was $14.30, represented by the left hash mark. The right hash mark at
$14.24 represents the closing price.

We can glean a lot of information from a quick visual observation of the bar chart. For
example, the fact that the bar for trading day 2 is much longer than the bar for trading day 1 in
Figure 11.7 indicates that the range on April 1, 2010, was much larger than the range on March
31. Another quick observation is that the bar for trading day 9, April 13, lies completely below
that of the previous trading day. Thus, the bar chart makes it easy to spot days when the trading
range lies completely outside of the previous day’s trading range.
Just as with the line chart, bar charts can be constructed for various intervals of data collec-
tion. For example, Figure 11.8 presents a weekly bar chart for AA for the same period as Figure
11.7. As we use longer and longer intervals to gather information for our bar charts, we lose
some of the details but will have a less-cluttered chart that offers more of a broad stroke picture
of past price movement.

Candlestick Charts
As mentioned in Chapter 3, “History of Technical Analysis,” candlestick charts originated in
Japan. This charting method was used as early as the mid-1600s to trade rice futures in the
Japanese markets and continues to be the most popular form of technical analysis in Japan.
These techniques have been widely used in the Far East for many generations, but not until
the publication of the book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques by Steve Nison in 1991
were Western traders introduced to candlestick charts. Before the publication of Nison’s book,
very few U.S. and European services offered candlestick charts. Today, almost every technical
analysis software package and technical service offers candlestick charts. You can even create
candlestick charts through the charting options in Excel.

212 Part III Trend Analysis
Candlestick charts are similar to bar charts in their construction. Both charts use the high
price, low price, and closing price, but candlestick charts always include the opening price. To
construct a candlestick chart, the low and high prices are plotted on a thin bar, just as they would
be for the bar chart we just discussed. A box is used to represent the opening and closing prices.
To create this box, a horizontal mark is made at both the opening and closing prices; a rectangle
is formed using these two horizontal marks. This rectangular box is called the real body of the
candlestick. If the security closed at a higher price than it opened, the real body is white (gray in
the charts here) or open. These white, or “open,” real body candlesticks indicate price advances
from the opening. Conversely, if the closing price falls below the opening price, the real body of
the candlestick is shaded black. These candlesticks with a “closed,” or black, real body designate
price declines from the opening.
Figure 11.9 is a candlestick chart of daily prices during the second quarter of 2010 (the
same as for Figure 11.7 and Figure 11.8) for AA. Much more colorful than the bar chart, the can-
dlestick chart makes it easy to spot immediately days in which AA closed at a higher price than
it opened. For example, the candle for the first trading day of the chart, March 31, has a gray
body, indicating that the stock closed at a higher price than it opened. The following day, how-
ever, we see a black-bodied candlestick, indicating that the stock closed lower than it opened that
day even though it close higher than the first day. ptg

As you can see in Figure 11.9, candlesticks come in a variety of shapes and sizes. If the
real body of the candlestick is tall, the opening price and closing price were relatively far apart.
Shorter real bodies indicate opening and closing prices that were very similar. In the extreme, the
real body can be so short that it is just a horizontal line, indicating that the opening and closing
prices were identical.

Chapter 11 History and Construction of Charts 213
The thin vertical bars, representing the price extremes of the trading session, are called the
shadows. The shadow above the real body is called the upper shadow; the shadow below the real
body is called the lower shadow. You can easily see how the candlestick chart got its name; many
times, the real body will look like a candle and the upper shadow will look like the wick.
Looking at the second candlestick in Figure 11.9, which represents price information for
October 4, we see that this candlestick has relatively short upper and lower shadows. This, along
with the black body, indicates that AA opened near the high and closed near the low of the day.
We see this same type of trading pattern four days later on April 8. We can also see candlesticks
with very long shadows. For example, in the candlestick for May 6, we see that its long shadow
represents a relatively wide trading range for the day. The highest price that AA traded on that
day was $12.64 and the lowest price was $11.25; the difference between these two extreme
prices gives us a thin vertical bar of $1.39, a swing of over 10% that day (the day of the famous
“flash crash”). Because the stock opened at $12.34 per share and closed at $11.94, the body of
the candle is only $0.40 tall, leaving a particularly long lower shadow.
In fact, individual candlesticks can take on a variety of interesting sizes. If the opening
price of the stock equals the low price for the trading session, a lower shadow will not exist on
that day. Likewise, if the security closes at its high price for the day, there will be no upper
shadow. Examples of this type of candlestick can be seen on May 4, May 14, and May 28. On ptg
some days, the opening and closing prices represent the entire trading range for the day.
Because candlestick charts contain all the information that a bar chart contains, all of the
technical tools that are used with bar charts can also be used with candlestick charts. In addition,
some technical tools rely on the color and size of individual candlesticks to signal trades. We
study the trading techniques that are peculiar to candlestick charts in Chapter 17, “Short-Term
Patterns.”
WHAT TYPE OF SCALE SHOULD BE USED?
Price units are generally plotted on the vertical axis of stock charts. The analyst must determine
the scale, or the distance between these price units, to use. Generally, two types of scales are
used: an arithmetic scale and a semi-logarithmic scale.
Arithmetic Scale
For all the charts we have examined so far, we—along with most technical analysts—have used
arithmetic (or linear) scales. A plot with an arithmetic scale shows the price units along the ver-
tical scale at the same price intervals. For example, the vertical plot distance of a change of $1 to
$2 would be the same as the plot distance from 10 to 11 or 100 to 101. In other words, using reg-
ular evenly divided grid paper, we plot each box vertically as the same dollar amount.

Semi-Logarithmic Scale
Although the arithmetic scale is the scale most often used, sometimes adjustments need to be
made, especially when observing long-term price movements. For example, compare Figure
11.10 with Figure 11.11.

FIGURE 11.10 Monthly bar chart for gold using arithmetic scale (December 2000–June 2010)
Both these charts plot the monthly price of gold for December 2000–June 2010. In April
2001, gold was trading for under $420 an ounce; at that time, a $42 increase in price would rep-
resent approximately a 10% gain for the investor. By June 2010, the gold price had advanced to
almost $1250 a share. At that point, a $42 price increase represented only about a 3% gain for an
investor owning gold. On the arithmetic scale, in Figure 11.10, a $100 price movement is visu-
ally the same whether it is a move from $400 to $500 or a move from $1100 to $1200. This type
of scale can be somewhat deceptive; a $100 move is much more significant to an investor if the
price of a security is $400 than if the price of the security is $1000. The logarithmic scale
addresses this issue.
On the logarithmic scale, the vertical distance represents the same percentage change in
price. Look at Figure 11.11. In this logarithmically scaled graph, the vertical distance between
$500 and $600 is the same as that between $1000 and $1200 or $100 and $200, respectively.
This vertical distance always represents a 100% increase in price rather than a particular dollar
amount increase in price. The rule of thumb for when to use an arithmetic or logarithmic scale is
that when the security’s price range over the period being investigated is greater than 20%, a log-
arithmic scale is more accurate and useful. As a rule, the truly long-term charts (more than a few
years) should always be plotted on logarithmic scales.

POINT-AND-FIGURE CHARTS
The point-and-figure chart records price data using a very different technique than line, bar, and
candlestick charts. At first, it may appear that the construction of these charts is somewhat
tedious. In addition, these kinds of charts are rarely published or discussed in the popular finan-
cial news. Because many of the point-and-figure charts are constructed using intraday trading
data, use of these charts was historically limited to professional analysts who had access to intra-
day data. However, with some practice, you will see that point-and-figure chart construction is
not that difficult and provides an interesting and accurate method of price analysis.
Point-and-figure charts account for price change only. Volume is excluded; and although
time can be annotated on the chart, it is not integral to the chart. The original point-and-figure
charts took prices directly from the tape as they were reported in the “Fitch Sheets” and by serv-
ices prepared especially for point-and-figure plotting, such as Morgan, Rogers, and Roberts.
Most of these services were put out of business by the computer and the use of the three-box
reversal charts. The reading of each stock or commodity trade by trade was a laborious process.
Today, very few services provide the data to plot one-point reversal charts.
The origin of point-and-figure charts is unknown, but we know they were used at the time
of Charles Dow around the late nineteenth century. Some have thought that “point” came from
the direction of the entries on the chart, pointing either up or down, but more likely “point” refers
to the location of the price plot, which at first was just a pencil-point mark. “Figure” comes from
the ability to figure from the points the target price.
Construction of a point-and-figure chart is very simple because only prices are used. Even
then, only the prices that meet the “box” size and “reversal” size are included. Finally, the chart

216 Part III Trend Analysis
reflects the high and low of the period, whenever it is important. Many technicians believe that
the high and low of the day are important numbers determined by supply and demand and are
more important than the opening or closing prices, which occur at single, arbitrary moments in
time.
As with all of the charting methods, different analysts use variations of point-and-figure
charting to best meet their particular needs. We begin our discussion of point-and-figure chart
construction by looking at the oldest method, referred to as the one-point reversal point-and-fig-
ure method. Further information about these one-point reversal charts can be found in reprints of
Alexander Whelan’s Study Helps in Point and Figure Technique.
One-Box (Point) Reversal
All point-and-figure charts are plotted on graph paper with squares that form a grid. There should
be enough squares to include a significant period of trading activity. Early charts had a special
outline around the rows ending in 0 and 5, just for clarity. As with the other types of charts, we
will plot price on the vertical axis, but the bottom axis is not time scaled with the point-and-fig-
ure graph.
The best way to learn to read a point-and-figure graph is to walk through an example of ptg
how this type of graph is constructed. Let us begin by taking a series of price changes in a stock
of 43.95, 44.10, 44.3, 44.15, 44.5, 44.7, 44.9, 44.85, 44.95, 45.00, 45.05, 44.4, and 43.9. Each
square (now called a “box”) on the graph paper will represent one point in the price. In point-
and-figure charting, the plot is made only when the actual price of the box is touched or traded
through. In this example, 43 would not be plotted because the price never reached 43 exactly or
traded through to below 43. Forty-four would be plotted because the price ran from 43.95 to
44.10, trading through 44.00. Thus, our first plot for the point-and-figure chart would be placing
an X in the 44 box when the price of 44.10 is observed, resulting in a chart that looks like Figure
11.12, Plot 1. For the next seven reported prices, no mark is made on the chart because all of
these trades are between 44 and 45. When the tenth price, 45.00 is observed, a second X is plot-
ted because the price actually touched 45. This X is plotted in the 45 box in the same column,
resulting in a chart that looks like Figure 11.12, Plot 2. We now know that this first column is
recording an uptrend in the stock price.
As long as the observed prices range above 44 and below 46, no more marks are made on
the graph. For example, the next prices recorded in our sample data are 45.05 and 44.4. Because
neither the next higher number (46) nor the next lower number (44) has been reached, no mark is
made to represent this price observation. These trades are considered “noise” and the point-and-
figure chart eliminates the plotting of this noise data.
It is not until the next price of 43.9 is observed that another mark is plotted. The price has
now reversed downward through 44. Obviously, there is already an X at 44 in Column 1. Column
1 represented an uptrend in the price, and only price increases can be recorded in it. Therefore,
we move to Column 2 and place an X at 44, as is shown in Figure 11.12, Plot 3. At this point, we
don’t know whether the trend in Column 2 is upward or downward. The second posting in this
column will tell us. If the price should now rise to 45 again, we would place an X at 45, and Col-
umn 2 would record rising prices. If the price should decline to 43, we would place an X at 43,
and Column 2 would record falling prices.

FIGURE 11.12 One-box reversal point-and-figure chart
Let us say that the price declines in a steady stream with no one-box reversals to 39.65, and
then it rallies back in a steady stream to 43.15. This would be represented as in Figure 11.12, Plot
4. A plot is made only in a new box when the price is trending in one direction and is then moved
over and plotted in the next column when that price reverses by a box size and cannot be plotted
in the same column. Remember that a particular column can record only price increases or price ptg
declines; in our example, Columns 1 and 3 represent price increases and Column 2 plots price
declines.
Box Size
From this basic method of plotting prices come many variations. Box size can be expanded, as in
our example in Figure 11.13, where the box size is expanded to two points and labeled 48, 50,
52, and so on. Then a two-point change in direction would be required before prices moved to the
next column. As shown in Figure 11.13, by increasing the size of the box, we reduce the amount
of noise even further. Gradually, as the box size increases, the amount of price history becomes
smaller and the chart becomes squeezed to the left, as fewer columns are necessary. The elimina-
tion of the noise makes the chart more useful to traders or investors interested in longer periods
of time and activity. On the other hand, if a pattern appears to be developing in the longer-term
chart, the box size can be reduced to give more detail near the potential longer-term change in
direction. This more detailed view can give early signals based on what the longer-term pattern
is forming.
Multibox Reversal
The other variable in a point-and-figure chart is the reversal amount. In our previous example, we
used one point for both the box plot and the reversal amount. We could have expanded that rever-
sal amount to three or five boxes, however. In other words, we could keep the one-point box scale
but only record a reversal to the next column when the price reversed by three boxes. This also
cuts down on the noise in price action and lengthens the time over which price action is recorded.

As an example, Figure 11.14 shows a one-point, three-box reversal chart of crude oil prices
(perpetual futures contract from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2010). The plot itself is a lit-
tle different from the pure one-point, one-box reversal chart. Xs are used for the column in which
prices are rising, and Os are used for the column in which prices are declining. This gives an eas-
ier-to-read picture of the price history.
The three-box reversal method gained popularity when Abe Cohen and Earl Blumenthal of
Chartcraft publicized it in the 1950s. More recently, Tom Dorsey has popularized this method in
his book Point and Figure Charting, and the majority of point-and-figure analysts now use the
three-box reversal method. Because the three-box reversal method is less concerned about small,
intraday changes in prices, it is especially useful when daily summary (H, L, C) price data is
being used.
Time
In some point-and-figure charts, when a new price is first recorded for a new month, the first let-
ter or the number of the month is plotted in place of the X or O. In other instances, the month is
recorded at the bottom of the column in which a price is first recorded for that month. We can
plot years, weeks, and days similarly, depending on how sensitive the chart may be to price
changes. Both methods can be used concurrently. Often, when years and months are the princi-
pal periods recorded, the year will be plotted on the bottom of the column and the month number
(1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) will be plotted instead of the X or O. Figure 11.15 shows the
same three-box, one-point reversal chart as Figure 11.14, with the dates included. Time is of lit-
tle importance in point-and-figure chart analysis. In many cases, it is plotted only to see how long
it takes for a formation or pattern to form.

220 Part III Trend Analysis
Arithmetic Scale
Scale becomes a problem in plotting point-and-figure charts, especially when the price rises or
falls a significant distance. Obviously, when a stock is trading at $70, a one-point move is less
significant than if it was trading at $7. Blumenthal first introduced the solution to this problem in
three-box reversal charts. He suggested that the chart scale be one point per box for prices
between $20 and $100, one-half point per box for prices between $5 and $19.50, one-quarter
point per box for stocks trading below $5, and two points per box for stocks trading above $100.
This scale has since become standard in most three-box reversal charts. However, depending on
the behavior of the stock price, the scale can be adjusted, and of course, it is useless in the futures
markets where prices are considerably different.
Logarithmic Scale
As in bar charts, when long periods of trading activity are plotted, distortion arises from the fact
that most charts are plotted on an arithmetic scale. Low-price action does not look as active as
high-price action. Logarithmic scale changes the plot to include percentage change rather than
absolute price change. Thus, the low-price action in percentage terms may appear more variable ptg
than the high-price action, and often is. To account for percentage change in point-and-figure
charts, prices are converted into their logarithmic equivalent and plotted as a logarithmic number.
This makes immediate interpretation difficult unless a table of logarithmic equivalents is imme-
diately handy, because most analysts cannot convert the logarithmic number into the actual price
in their heads.
This scale, however, should be used only for long periods of price data in which consider-
able volatility has made an arithmetic scale meaningless. For most investment and trading, the
arithmetic scale is not only just as useful, but it is also easier to read and to convert to actual
prices.
CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we have studied several different methods that technical analysts use to create
charts. Line charts, which plot a single statistic, are the simplest of these methods. Bar charts and
the more colorful Japanese candlestick charts provide more summary information, such as the
opening price, the closing price, and the price range for a particular trading period. Point-and-
figure charts provide a much different approach to graphing price data; with this method, sequen-
tial trading data is plotted with price trends and reversals emphasized.
All types of charts can include data of varying frequency: monthly, weekly, daily, and even
intraday data. The frequency that an analyst will choose will depend upon the type of analysis
and the period being explored. Analysts may choose to use an arithmetic scale, where the verti-
cal distance on the graph always represents the same dollar amount, or an analyst may prefer a
logarithmic scale so that the vertical distance in the chart always represents the same percentage
change. We address these issues throughout the book as we look at various techniques of techni-
cal analysis. Remember that the chart is a tool of technical analysts, not an end in and of itself.

Therefore, there is not one correct charting technique but several that can meet a variety of ana-
lysts’ needs.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Melinda is analyzing Wal-Mart’s stock over the past three months and notices that the price
has ranged from $51 to $53 per share. Joshua is analyzing Merck’s stock over the past five
years and notices that the price has ranged from $20 to $65 a share over that period. Which
analyst would be more likely to use an arithmetic scale, and which analyst would be more
likely to use a logarithmic scale to analyze price information? Explain your reasoning.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should
• Know why identifying trends is paramount to profits in securities ptg
• Be able to recognize an uptrend, downtrend, and a trading range
• Understand the concept of support and resistance
• Be familiar with the major methods of determining trends
• Be familiar with the major signals that a trend is reversing
We are now entering into the more controversial aspects of technical analysis: the analysis of
trends and in Part IV, “Chart Pattern Analysis,” the analysis of patterns. This is the “fuzzy” aspect
of technical analysis. Because the observations or rules are not specific, they discourage most
students very quickly. Rules in technical analysis come from many, many observations by many
traders and investors. In general, the rules have remained unchanged since Dow’s time, and in
reading some of the old masters back in the 1930s, one sees the same observations today. The
advent of the computer has speeded the process and has often eliminated rules that are quantifi-
able but turn out to be unprofitable. However, the basics remain essentially the same. The mar-
kets have near, intermediate, and long-term trends. Patterns still form in much the same manner
as 50 or 100 years ago, and analysts interpret them in the same manner as in the past. The details
may be different, and perhaps the methods of profiting are dependent on various trade-offs
between risk and reward, but still the analyst must use the rules and decide on the entry and exit
points. The difficulty of profiting from technical analysis is not with the rules themselves but
with their application.
In all the following chapters in this book, it is important to remember that the observations
and statements we make derive from our observations and those of other practitioners of techni-
cal analysis. Most trends and patterns are not mechanical methods that can be easily pro-
grammed and tested on computers. Generally, they take long periods—sometimes years of

practice—to be fully recognized. One of the major criticisms of technical analysis is that it has
yet to be thoroughly computerized and tested. As we saw in Part II, “Markets and Market Indica-
tors,” many relationships have been tested in the past but then break down as the future unfolds.
The only constants, it seems, are that trends occur and that they are the source of profit when rec-
ognized and properly utilized.
All analysts occasionally make statements that appear to be fact, but in many cases, they
are statements based on subjective observations and should never be blindly relied upon without
a thorough investigation. Our discussion of trend, support and resistance, and pattern nuances
will show where they can be in error or where interpretation can be particularly difficult. Rules
have developed over the years that will help with interpretation. Nevertheless, the student, when
he can, should test and experiment. Nothing in technical analysis, or any other investment analy-
sis approach, is foolproof. Indeed, it is surprising how much money is invested using fundamen-
tal and technical theories that have not been tested or have proven to be unprofitable. Most
professionals, who have spent their lifetime in the study and practice of technical analysis, will
assert, “There is no easy, magic formula for wealth!” Do not, therefore, expect the following
observations and rules to be an easy means to profit. Study, have patience, and study some more.
We suggest that the student trade on paper, and finally with small amounts of money. There is no
need to rush. The markets are always there.
ptg
TREND—THE KEY TO PROFITS
Remember that profit with minimum capital risk in the securities markets is the sole objective,
and technical analysis is an effective way to profit as well as to control risk. In earlier chapters,
we emphasized the importance of determining and riding the directional trend in the security
markets. The key to profiting in the securities market is to follow these three steps:
1. Determine, with minimum risk of error, when a trend has begun, at its earliest time and
price.
2. Select and enter a position in the trend that is appropriate to the existing trend, regardless
of direction (i.e., trade with the trend—long in upward trends and short or in cash in down-
ward trends).
3. Close those positions when the trend is ending.
Trending is very simple in concept, but it is difficult in practice. Almost all successful
mechanical trading systems that have made millions and millions for their investors have been
based on the simple concept of jumping on a trend and riding it to its inevitable end. We discuss
the principles behind some of these methods later in this chapter and in following chapters.
The principal caveat, however, in technical analysis, as mentioned previously, is that
although the trend concept is easy to understand, its application is difficult largely because the
determination of trend and trend reversal is, in many instances, a subjective decision that
depends on one’s skill and experience in the securities markets and one’s ability to control one’s
own emotions. Practice and mental anguish are the background of any successful technical

analyst. The most expensive education in the world is likely the money lost in incorrect, sloppy,
and undisciplined decisions. All market participants make mistakes, but the regimented profes-
sionals correct theirs quickly.
When we arrive at Chapter 15, “Bar Chart Patterns,” and discuss the various price patterns
that have been observed, we will note that all patterns are a combination of trend lines—up,
down, or sideways. It is, therefore, imperative first to understand trends and trend lines. In addi-
tion, all patterns are used to either confirm that a longer trend is still in control or warn that such
a trend is changing. Patterns are, therefore, not trade signals explicitly in themselves, but they are
the means of taking advantage of the underlying and, perhaps, changing trends.
TREND TERMINOLOGY
Trends define a direction in prices. When we refer to a trend, we describe a directional trend, one
of rising or falling prices from which a profit can be generated with a trend-following method.
We refer to a sideways trend as a trading range or neutral area. These are the recognized terms
for describing different types of trends. Trend-following techniques work poorly in nontrending
markets. Most technicians prefer to use price oscillators when dealing with such patterns.
ptg
In the next several chapters, we look at prices from the positive, advancing perspective. By
that, we mean that when we discuss trends per se, we assume an upward trend (an uptrend). In
most cases, the description and rules of a downtrend are exactly opposite from those of an
uptrend. It does not make sense to duplicate every statement for both trend directions. Likewise,
when we discuss support and resistance, we discuss support and make the assumption, unless
otherwise noted, that resistance is the exact opposite but in an opposing direction. We do this for
readability and because most investors prefer to look at rising prices anyway, even though there
is no rational reason for doing so.
BASIS OF TREND ANALYSIS—DOW THEORY
As we learned in Chapter 6, “Dow Theory,” Charles Dow was one of the first of the modern tech-
nicians to write about the fact that stock market prices trade in trends. Virtually all items that
trade in free, liquid markets trade in trends. As noted by Dow, investors or traders must concen-
trate on the time horizon most favorable to their circumstances.
Trends are fractal, in that their behavior is the same regardless of the period. Minute-to-
minute trends behave exactly like day-to-day trends with only minor differences because of the
understandable variation in liquidity over the shorter periods. Dow suggested there were three
principal time horizons—the primary, the intermediate, and the minor—that he likened to tides,
waves, and ripples. In fact, there are considerably more trend periods. He focused on the first two
because he apparently believed no one could analyze the ripples. Today, some technicians recog-
nize considerably more trends than Dow observed, but then he did not have the advantage of a
computer that could track prices trade by trade.

226 Part III Trend Analysis
Dow’s final, and perhaps most important, observation was that by their very nature, trends
tend to continue rather than reverse. If it were otherwise, first, there would not be a trend, and
second, the trend could not be used for profit. This seems like a silly and perhaps too obvious
statement, but it underlies almost everything the technician assumes when looking for the begin-
ning or end of trends. It also vexes the academic theoretician who believes that price changes are
random.
Any particular trend is influenced by its next larger and next smaller trend. For example, in
Figure 12.1, we can see a well-defined uptrend in the stock of JNJ (Johnson & Johnson). It is not
a straight line upward, however. Within the rising trend are many smaller trends, both down and
up, and if we look more closely, there are even smaller down- and uptrends within these. This is
the fractal nature of trends. Notice also that the next set of trends below the long uptrend have
larger rises and smaller declines. This is the effect the larger trend is having on the smaller trends.
It is why the analyst, when studying any particular length trend, must be aware of the next longer
and shorter trend directions. The longer trends will influence the strength of the trend of interest,
and the shorter trends will often give early signs of turning in the longer. By definition, short-
term trends reverse before medium-term, and medium-term trends reverse before long-term.

HOW DOES INVESTOR PSYCHOLOGY IMPACT TRENDS?
As we know from basic economics, supply and demand establishes the price of any good. It is no
different in the securities markets. Supply and demand, when sellers and buyers agree on a trade,
determines prices. What does price, and especially price change, tell us? Presumably, if a sub-
stantial number of transactions occur at one price, the price is telling us that supply and demand

Chapter 12 Trends—The Basics 227
are in a temporary equilibrium and that both buyers and sellers are satisfied. Of course, in the
financial markets, long-term equilibrium is rarely reached. Prices constantly change, if only by
miniscule amounts, as they move toward a theoretical equilibrium. They can oscillate in small
increments or large; they can go up and/or down; or they can do both. Whatever the price move-
ment, it is ultimately determined by the expectations and power of the buyers and sellers. If
broad expectations are for a higher price in the future but with little or no capital to act, prices
will remain as they are or even decline. Of course, expectations change, as does the power to act.
Nothing is perfectly stable or constant in the markets.
When prices travel in a trend, called trending, they remain headed in one direction, and
they tell us that there is an imbalance of demand and supply. Some will incorrectly say that there
are more buyers than sellers or vice versa. However, in every transaction, there are an equal num-
ber of shares transacted, and, thus, there is always temporary equilibrium between buyers and
sellers at that instant in time. What makes a trend is the power of the buyers or sellers—do they
have enough stock or money?—and the aggressiveness or anxiousness of buyers and sellers—do
they have specific information or deductions, rational or irrational, or are emotions of fear or
greed propelling their action?
We know from behavioral studies that, psychologically, a positive feedback mechanism in
our minds tends collectively to maintain that trend. In an uptrend, for example, buyers who have
profited tend to continue being buyers, and new buyers, seeing what they have missed, also buy. ptg
The price trend continues upward. Eventually, over a longer period, prices revert to some kind of
mean or value, but meanwhile, they trend, up, down, or sideways. If, for example, prices are
gradually rising, then buyers must have stronger positive expectations and be willing and able to
place more money in the security. Contrarily, if prices are declining, sellers must have stronger
negative expectations and larger positions to sell. The price trend, thus, tells us the amount of
power, aggressiveness, and anxiousness there is in the marketplace to buy or sell each security.
To the technical analyst, the basis for the expectations—and there are many—as well as the
source of power, money, or stock, is largely irrelevant. The anticipating and “riding” a trend in
prices, as long as it continues, is how the technician profits.
HOW IS THE TREND DETERMINED?
Of course, the trend is never a straight line. Then it would be too easy to tell that it had reversed.
Instead, the trend is a direction rather than a line. Many doubting participants often accompany
this direction. Sometimes, it can be arbitrageurs, who bet against the trend or who are merely
trading the spread. More likely, it is investors or traders running out of money or stock or just
holding back for a little while, hoping that the price will retrace back toward their orders. In other
words, the security price oscillates back and forth in smaller trends along its travel in the larger
trend. This makes determining when that larger trend is reversing a difficult decision because any
signs of reversal may only be for smaller trends within the larger trend. Additionally, securities
occasionally “rest” during a trend and move sideways as the earlier rise or fall is “digested” by
all the different players. The psychology of what causes these spurts, stops, and retracements is
an interesting study by itself, but again it is irrelevant for our present discussion. We simply want
to know what our trend of interest is, and are there signs of it ending or changing direction?

228 Part III Trend Analysis
Peaks and Troughs
What is the simplest way to look at prices and determine the trend? The easiest is to look for
peaks and troughs within a series of price oscillations. If the peaks tend to be higher than the ear-
lier peaks, and the troughs tend to be higher than the previous troughs, the trend must be upward.
As you see in Figure 12.2, it is that simple. If peaks and troughs are lower than previously, the
trend must be downward. If the peaks and troughs are scattered, the trend is undeterminable, and
if the peaks and troughs occur at the same relative levels, the trend must be a trading range.

It is much easier to look at price trends on a chart. As the previous chapter demonstrated, a
table of data makes recognition of price order of any sort very difficult. Most technicians use
either bar or candlestick charts to draw lines representing trends (see Figures 12.3 and 12.4).
There are many ways to do this that are discussed later in the chapter. For now, let us begin with
discussing sideways trends because they display very clearly an important technical concept
called support and resistance.

230 Part III Trend Analysis
DETERMINING A TRADING RANGE
Trading ranges (or sideways trends) occur when peaks and troughs appear roughly at similar lev-
els. The peaks cluster at a certain price level, and the troughs cluster at a certain price level below
the peaks. The configuration usually occurs after a larger trend has come to a temporary halt. A
trading range also is called a consolidation or congestion area or a rectangle formation.
Charles Dow called very small lateral patterns a line formation and using it in the Dow Jones
Averages had very specific rules by which the averages had to abide for that designation. William
Hamilton, Dow’s successor editor at the Wall Street Journal, thought the line formation was the
only price formation with any predictive power.
What Is Support and Resistance?
When prices have been rising and then reverse downward, the highest point in the rise, the peak,
is referred to as a resistance point, a level at which the advance has met with selling “resist-
ance.” It is the level at which sellers are as powerful and aggressive as the buyers and halt the
advance. When the sellers (supply) become more powerful and aggressive than the buyers
(demand), the result is a subsequent price decline from the peak. A resistance level becomes a
ptg
resistance zone when more than one resistance level occurs at roughly the same price. Prices
rarely rise and stop at exactly the same level. A single, high-volume, price peak often defines a
resistance point, but even then, because the high volume, especially if it is preceded by a sharp
price rise, is a sign of speculation and emotion, and the price where large sellers actually begin to
enter the market is unclear.
A support point is the opposite of a resistance point in that it is a single trough. At the sup-
port point, buyers become as powerful or aggressive as the sellers and halt a price decline.
The concept of support and resistance presumes that in the future prices will stop at these
recorded levels or zones and that they represent a remembered psychological barrier for prices.
The zones will carry through time and become barriers to future price action. Not only will the
zones carry through time, but also, once they are broken through, they will switch functions: Pre-
vious support will become resistance, and previous resistance will become support.
Why Do Support and Resistance Occur?
Have you ever bought a stock, watched it decline in price, and yearned to sell out for
what you paid for it? Have you ever sold a stock, watched it go up after you had sold
it, and wished you had the opportunity to buy it again? Well, you are not alone. These
are common human reactions, and they show up on the stock charts by creating sup-
port and resistance. (Jiler, 1962)
Let us look at the presumed psychology behind a support level and see why it might carry
into the future.

Chapter 12 Trends—The Basics 231
There is little question that a price trough is a point where buyers overwhelmed sellers. In
Figure 12.5, JNJ peaked at $56.50 on May 20 (a), a potential resistance level, and then declined
touching $53.86 on May 28 (b), at which point it reversed upward. This support-point price
becomes a support level. It is almost exactly the same level as support point (z), which bottomed
at $53.90. Subsequently, the stock price rallied back to $56.50 on June 6 (c), the exact same level
as the earlier May 20 (a) resistance point. We now have two, well-defined resistance points and
two support points: $56.50 and $53.90.
We can assume there are the potential buyers at $53.90 because:
1. In the next sell-off, those who sold short at $56.50 will be covering because they have seen
that the price halted its earlier decline at $53.90 (b and z) and do not want to take the risk

immediately rise thereafter, and wish to reenter a position at the price they sold it earlier.

more frequently prices halt at a zone, the stronger and more important that zone will likely be in
the future.
A resistance zone will likely now also exist at $56.50 for similar reasons because sellers at
that price wish to sell: sellers who missed $56.50 before, sellers who bought at $56.50 and want
their money back, and sellers who want to short the stock at $56.50 where it halted earlier. Sup-
port and resistance zones, therefore, are price levels where supply and demand reach equilibrium
for unusual but persistent psychological reasons.
What About Round Numbers?
Ironically, when prices reach round numbers, the tendency to buy and sell increases. As an exam-
ple, Figure 12.5 of JNJ shows a strong support and resistance level at $53.9 (almost $54.00).
People think in terms of round numbers. Otherwise, why would Wal-Mart sell a shirt for $29.95
rather than $30? They know people subconsciously will associate with the “29” and will believe
they are getting a $29 shirt rather than a $30 one. People think in terms of round numbers and act
accordingly in the securities markets as well. The current problem with the concept of round
numbers is that knowledge of that tendency is widespread. From the standpoint of entering
orders then, it is best to determine entry and exit points based on the technical situation rather
than worry about round numbers. ptg
How Are Important Reversal Points Determined?
The more important the reversal point, the more important the support or resistance level. There
are a number of ways to identify a significant reversal point. Let us look at some of them.1
DeMark or Williams Method
Tom DeMark and Larry Williams each have a method of determining a reversal point by using
the number of bars (in a bar chart) on either side of a suspected reversal point. In a low bar, for
example, the analyst may look for two bars with higher lows directly on either side of the sus-
pected trough bar. The number of bars on either side can be increased to increase the importance
of the trough, but the number of troughs will be sacrificed. The higher the number of confirming
lows necessary, the more important the trough.
As an example, look at Figure 12.6. Each of the two-bar lows and highs are marked with an
arrow. Point (a) is not a trough because it does not have at least two bars on either side of it with
higher lows. Likewise, Point (b) is not a peak. It does not have two bars on either side of it with
lower highs. Is Point (c) a peak? We do not know because we can’t see if there are two bars to the
left of the high to judge Point (c).
1. In this section, we focus primarily on how to determine significant troughs and support levels. Of course, significant
peaks and resistance levels would be determined in the same fashion, only in the opposite direction.

ptg
Percentage Method
Another method of identifying significant troughs is by deciding beforehand how much the
price should decline and rally into the trough. A percentage is usually used. Using 1%, for exam-
ple, any time the price declines more than 1%, makes a low, and then rallies more than 1% will
define a significant trough. The larger the percentage used, the more important but less frequent
the reversal point.
Gann Two-Day Swing Method
W. D. Gann’s swing method is very similar to the DeMark or Williams method. To find a support
point, or trough, a low bar is identified. Once the low bar is identified, the two following trading
days are observed. If these two days have higher highs than the low bar, then the low bar is a sup-
port point. Originally, Gann used the three following trading days to determine a support point,
but more recently, it has been switched to two days (Krausz, 1998). Likewise, a resistance point
is defined as any high bar during an uptrend that is followed by two successive bars with lower
lows. Figure 12.7 is identical to Figure 12.6, except that the reversal points are determined using
the Gann rule. The difference between the two charts is that at Point (a), (b), and (c), the reversal
points as defined by the Gann rule do not occur at the DeMark/Williams reversal points. The rea-
sons are that the days of the actual reversal points were not followed by the required two succes-
sive days. Thus, by Gann’s rule, the reversal may not occur on the actual high or low bar.

High Volume Method
Very large volume can also identify a significant reversal point. High volume indicates that larger
than usual activity occurred on that trading day. Figure 12.8 shows a one-day reversal on high
volume at a high, creating a significant reversal point and resistance level that stopped the subse-
quent rally.
Figure 12.8 illustrates a one-day and a two-day reversal. A two-day reversal looks the same
as a one-day reversal except that it takes place over two days. These one- or two-day patterns can
occur at peaks or troughs. When these occur on high volume, they usually signify important
reversal points. Because these formations usually occur at a stage of high emotion, they signify
either a panic or a speculative bubble. As such, the actual price level at which the reversal took
place is not identifiable on a large bar chart. Sometimes intraday action must be inspected to see
at just what price level the majority of buying and selling occurred.
How Are Support and Resistance Zones Drawn?
To construct a support (or resistance) zone, simply draw a horizontal line through each signifi-
cant trough (or peak) into the future. These lines can be drawn through the respective bar lows or,
as Jiler (1962) suggests, using the bar’s close because this is what most investors read in the
paper. These lines should also be extended into the past to see if earlier price declines stopped at
the same price level. Where these horizontal lines bunch together, sometimes overlapping at the
same price level is a support or resistance zone. This zone is usually stronger the more horizon-
tal lines there are within it. In other words, the more times the price level has halted previous
advances or supported previous declines, the stronger will be the resistance or support in the
future. Because all previous significant troughs have not likely occurred at exactly the same price
level, an area called a zone is constructed between the highest and lowest horizontal line. This
defines the actual support or resistance area clearly.

Figure 12.9 shows how support and resistance lines are drawn. Notice that the line just
under $44 was first a support line, holding the decline from $46 for almost a week, and then
became a resistance line when the price later rallied from below several times and halted at that
level. Notice also that the rally above $44 in late September matched the rally to the same level
in early September. These two resistance lines create a resistance zone. Notice also the support
line between $38 and $40. This was touched three times before prices broke below it in early
November.

236 Part III Trend Analysis
If a horizontal line is by itself with no other horizontal lines close to it, it is likely an inde-
pendent support or resistance level. Such levels, unless accompanied by extraordinary volume,
usually do not have the same strength in the future that a combination of horizontal lines might
have within a zone.
In the future, prices will tend to halt at these zones, and occasionally at a single level.
Prices will often enter the zone but will not break out of the outer horizontal line of the zone. If
they do break that level, we have what is called a “breakout” that has important consequences. A
price break below the support zone implies that buyers are satiated at that level. See the down-
ward breakout in Figure 12.9 in November at the support line. In this instance, the break left a
vacuum of buyers, and the sellers, at least at that price, now control the stock. If there is another
support zone at some distance below the current broken zone, prices will generally trade down to
that next lower zone. Thus, a support zone in a declining market can become a price objective
once a higher support zone is broken. Support zones exist at all horizons—day, week, or even
minute-to-minute. Some traders only trade stocks or futures, especially e-mini futures, between
these zones often on an intraday basis between very, very short-term support and resistance
zones.
What we have said about resistance zones is equally applicable to support zones. Horizon-
tal lines at significant troughs will show the existence of these zones, and extended into the
future, they will become zones of support to price decline. In addition, as time goes on, the ptg
importance of past horizontal lines diminishes for both support and resistance zones. More
recent price reversals are more important. Human memory fades quickly.
How Do Analysts Use Trading Ranges?
Getting back to our earlier introduction of sideways trends, a trading range, as shown in Figure
12.9, is a price level where both support and resistance zones are relatively close together, and
prices “bounce” between them until finally breaking out in one or the other direction. Some
traders will trade the “bounces” between support and resistance, but this is usually very danger-
ous and requires very low operating costs and constant attention (Schwager, 1996). The most
profitable and reliable way to use the trading range is to practice “breakout” trading. Let us look
at each of these strategies a little more closely.
Range Trading
Trading within a range is difficult. Although many books suggest it as a strategy, it is almost
impossible for the nonprofessional to profit through range trading. First, it is difficult to recognize
that prices are trading in a range until after a considerable amount of trading and time has passed.
It is, therefore, largely in retrospect that the opportunities are recognized. In addition, operating
costs, such as commissions and slippage, must be small and execution efficient, else any potential
profit will be overwhelmed by transactions costs. Because the bounds of a trading range are often
zones rather than specific price levels, the point at which an execution order, either buy or sell,
should be placed is indefinite. Finally, the location for a protective stop-loss order to prevent a
breakout from ruining trading profits is difficult to determine. By the time all these costs and exe-
cution levels are recognized, the potential for profit has diminished considerably, making any

Chapter 12 Trends—The Basics 237
profit versus risk unlikely. Thus, most traders stay away from trading within a trading range and
instead wait for the inevitable breakout and beginning of a trend.
The one exception to range trading is channel trading. A channel is a trading range tipped
at an angle such that it trends upward or downward. Trend lines define the bounds of the channel
just as support and resistance lines define the trading range. One can trade these channels back
and forth but only in the direction of the channel trend. In other words, for example, if the chan-
nel is trending upward, only long positions are taken at the lower bounds and sold at the upper
bounds, but no short position is taken contrary to the channel trend. As mentioned earlier,
upward trends have longer upward subtrends and shorter downward subtrends. To a certain
extent, depending on the slope of the channel trend, the subtrends in the direction of the trend
reduce the difficulty seen in trading ranges.
Breakout Trading
Breakout trading is as old as technical analysis and likely the most successful. Remember that a
trading range is somewhat like a battleground, where the buyers and sellers are warring for dom-
inance. Most chart patterns are combinations of trend lines and, thus, are battlegrounds also.
Before the war is over, it is almost impossible to determine who will win. It is usually wiser, and
more profitable, to wait rather than to guess. Once, however, prices break out of the trading
ptg
range, the investor has information about who has won the war. If the breakout is to the upside,
buyers are driving price up; if the breakout occurs to the downside, sellers are overwhelming
buyers. Trading on this breakout is probably the most profitable and reliable strategy for the
investor faced with a trading range or pattern.
Breakout trading can be used in many different ways other than for just trading ranges.
One of the most famous is the Donchian breakout method, also called the “four-week breakout
system,” originated by Richard Donchian and later improved upon by Richard Dennis. It still
appears to work. A recent study by Active Trader Magazine (Kurczek and Knapp, 2003) indi-
cates that even though the method is popular and has been widely known for many years, it still
produces profits, especially in the commodities futures markets. Its calculation is absurdly sim-
ple. Buy when the highest high over the past four weeks is broken, and sell when the lowest low
over the past four weeks is broken. A “stop-and-reverse” strategy requires a position, long or
short, at all times.
A breakout is a powerful signal. It indicates that the balance between demand and supply
has been settled, usually violently, and, thus, is an indication of the initiation or continuation of a
directional trend. The subject of breakouts and stops is covered in the next chapter.
DIRECTIONAL TRENDS (UP AND DOWN)
We have just considered trading ranges in which successive peaks and troughs occur at roughly
the same price level. This results in a flat or sideways trend in prices. Whenever reversal points
are occurring at higher (lower levels) than the previous reversal points then price is trending
upward (downward).

238 Part III Trend Analysis
What Is a Directional Trend?
When a peak and trough occur at higher price levels than the immediately previous peak
and trough, the trend has turned upward. Conversely, for a peak and trough lower than their pre-
vious peak and trough, the trend has turned down. The angle of the trend, therefore, is deter-
mined by the amount by which the peaks and troughs are higher or lower than their previous
levels. To see this more clearly, a chart is almost a necessity. Figure 12.2 at the beginning of this
chapter shows an upward trend in JNJ weekly from 2008 through 2010. The principles of trends
are applicable regardless of direction.
Quite obviously, the steeper the angle of the trend, the more powerful is the buyer or seller
group. It means that the one group is overwhelming the other group at a faster pace. In a decline,
sellers are willing to receive lower and lower prices before becoming temporarily exhausted at a
trough. In an advance, buyers are more and more anxious and willing to pay higher prices. This
is the time when an investor who is long the security is happiest. It is a trend and is what the tech-
nician is looking for in indicators and charts. The corollary, however, is that the steeper the angle
of ascent or descent, the less sustainable it becomes.
An uptrend, therefore, is a display of the eagerness of the buyers versus the eagerness of
the sellers. It is similar to the concept of support and resistance except that the support and resist-
ance are changing in a specific direction. Because all the stock desired by the buyers and sold by ptg
the sellers is not transacted at one time and at one price level but over a time as news leaks out
and positive feedback affects other players, the price trend continues until it has reached a point
of exhaustion. At that level, the price trend either flattens out in a congestion or consolidation
area or reverses direction into a declining trend. Some analysts argue that an actual trend only
lasts a short time, approximately 20% of the trading period, and during the remaining time prices
remain in a consolidation or pattern formation with an indefinite trend. No one has demonstrated
the validity of this percentage, however. It was estimated only by counting the time that an ADX
indicator (a measure of trending tendency—see Chapter 14, “Moving Averages”) shows that a
trend exists in varying markets, periods, and circumstances.
It is undeniable, however, that the majority of profits come from correctly anticipating and
acting upon a trend, and for this reason, almost all technical study is devoted toward early antic-
ipation of a trend.
How Is an Uptrend Spotted?
In retrospect, a trend is easy to spot, especially on a price chart. Without being specific, it is usu-
ally easy to see reversal points and the general direction of historical prices. The difficulty, from
an analysis standpoint, comes in being specific enough to determine when the signs of a trend
change are occurring. To do this, the technical analyst uses several tools: (1) the regression line,
(2) the trend line, and (3) moving averages. In this chapter, we discuss the regression line but
focus the majority of our attention on the trend line. We focus on the use of moving averages in
Chapter 14.

Chapter 12 Trends—The Basics 239
Using a Regression Line
Mathematic formulas can fit two sets of data, such as price and time, to a straight line. This
method is called linear regression, and the line derived from this formula is called a regression
line. This line has two variables—its starting point and its slope. Where the data begins and ends
determines both variables. The technical analyst is interested in the regression line’s location on
the chart and to some degree its slope. In the example in Figure 12.10, the regression line from
the bottom price to the top price travels through a majority of the data. Indeed, the mathematical
equation used to determine the line minimizes the distance between all the data points and the
theoretical line. The line is said to be the “best fit” to the data.
We can also calculate standard deviations about this best fit line that will encompass most
of the data. Outliers, those prices that occur outside of the standard deviation lines, are consid-
ered as either anomalies or, to the technical analyst, if they occur in the most recent data, signs
that the trend may be changing. In Figure 12.10, the right-hand, most recent, price plots are out-
side the standard deviation of the line. These, having occurred recently, are a clue that the regres-
sion line slope may be flattening.

Using Trend Lines
The oldest and easiest method of determining the trend of prices is with a trend line. Trend lines
are drawn with just a ruler and the use of one’s eyes rather than a fancy mathematical formula.
All that is needed is two support reversal points or two resistance reversal points. A line is drawn
between the reversal points, as shown in Figure 12.11.

The important lesson to learn is that the lines are generally drawn between lows (support)
when the price is rising and between tops (resistance) when the price is declining. The lines that
connect the lows or highs extend into the future so that the analyst can tell when the trend line is
broken. Remember, the purpose of the trend line is to provide a signal of a change in trend. For
example, in Figure 12.11, price movement appeared to be in the upward direction. Therefore, a
trend line was drawn that connected the major troughs in May, June, July, and August and con-
tinued to the right. In late August, when prices broke below the trend line, analysts had a clue that
the trend was changing.
Scale and Trend Lines
The problem of scale sometimes arises in the plotting of trend lines as it does with prices. Gen-
erally, on an arithmetic scaled chart in which the prices are displayed within a 20%–40% range,
a trend line can be drawn with accuracy. When price changes have occurred over a wider range,
the logarithmic scaled chart is necessary. In this case, the trend line represents a percentage
change in prices rather than a point change. Over long periods, this is the preferred method
because it represents better how investors look at a stock price. Generally, over long periods,
investors think in terms of percentages, whereas over shorter periods, they may think more in
terms of points.
Accelerating Trend Lines
Another problem with trend lines is that they might not be straight lines. Often prices, especially
in a speculative bubble or in a panic, will accelerate upward or downward and run away from a
standard, straight trend line. In this case, the trend line must be adjusted continually to account
for the price action’s acceleration. This phenomenon is shown graphically in Figure 12.12.

Chapter 12 Trends—The Basics 241
An accelerating trend line, of course, is unsustainable because eventually it would reach an
infinite slope. If the acceleration can be calculated through mathematical means, the expected
time for the infinite slope will be the time by which the price must reach its zenith. It is a means
of determining when the latest time for the eventual reversal will occur. As we will see in the
chapters on patterns, an accelerating price trend has very profitable, as well as dangerous, impli-
cations.
Decelerating Trend Lines
The opposite of an accelerating trend line is the decelerating trend line. This is called a fan line.
In the chart, the fan lines are shown as regular trend lines that are being broken without an obvi-
ous reversal in direction and then being redrawn to account for each new support level. Figure
12.13 shows the fanning effect that decelerating trend lines give.
These lines can go on forever in theory, but practitioners have generally stated that the
maximum to be expected is three fan lines before a reversal in direction is to be expected. These
three fan lines often are accompanied by some kind of standard pattern. Of course, if an earlier
support zone is broken as well as a trend, it is a stronger implication that the trend has reversed
direction.

General Rules for Trend Lines
Several standard rules have been developed about trend lines. One is that the longer and the more
times that the drawn line is touched by prices, the more significant it is when the line is finally
broken. Another is that the steeper the trend line, the sooner it will be broken. This is obvious in
an accelerating trend line but is equally true in a steep, straight trend line.
Sometimes a trend line is broken slightly by intraday price action, as shown in Figure
12.14. This action provides a problem for the analyst who must determine whether the break is
permanent and indicative of a trend change, or whether it is an anomaly. Should it be ignored, or
should the trend line be adjusted slightly to accommodate the new level? The question here is
whether the break of the trend line is significant or just minor. Trend lines should never be con-
sidered exact, largely because price action within a bar may be influenced for a very short time
by exogenous factors that have nothing to do with the trend. Some analysts, for example, draw
trend lines between peak and trough closing prices rather than intraday highs and lows. They
argue that because intraday traders usually must close their positions by day’s end and are out of
the market by then, the closing price represents longer-term players’ determination of supply and
demand and is, thus, a truer figure for drawing longer trend lines. By using the closing prices, the
number of false breakouts is usually reduced. We discuss these issues regarding the rules for
breakouts more thoroughly in the next chapter.

Channels
Remember that uptrend lines should be plotted between support troughs, and downtrend lines
should be plotted between resistance peaks. In other words, when prices are trending upward, the
trend line will lie below the price action, and when prices are trending downward, the trend line
will appear above the price action.
Sometimes, as in Figure 12.15, prices appear to travel in a “channel.” A line is plotted
through resistance reversal points and is parallel to the underlying uptrend line. This forms a
channel. These channels often contain price motion just as the congestion area or rectangle for-
mation contains prices when the trend is sideways. Remember that a trend is a direction of sup-
ply and demand. In an uptrend, the lower line represents the increasing demand for the security,
and often the supply of the security is traveling parallel but above the demand. Thus, prices tend
to “bounce” off this rising upper channel line as if supply were present at these moving intervals
and rising at the same rate as demand. Indeed, when we see that a resistance reversal point is no
longer parallel on the channel line (see Figure 12.15), but beginning to close on the underlying
trend line, we know that supply is getting just a little more anxious and that the price is likely
approaching a reversal point. Final proof that the channel has ended is when the price breaks the
trend line. The same channel rules apply in downtrends.
A channel line can be drawn almost immediately after two troughs and their intervening
peaks are recognized. A line is drawn parallel to the trend line through the intervening peak and
projected into the future. This line now becomes a target line for subsequent rallies within the
channel. In Figure 12.16, for example, the channel line (dashed line) could have been drawn as
soon as the second trough in July had been recognized, by drawing a parallel line through the
May peak. Projected into the future, that channel line was a level at which subsequent rallies
would be expected to reach, just as the next one did at the peak in July.

Another potential signal with channel lines is when, in an uptrend, for example, the price
breaks above the channel line rather than being contained by it. This is a sign that the underlying
trend is accelerating and that its end is coming closer. Such occurrences also occur during a
downtrend and signal that a major price bottom is not far ahead. Any kind of acceleration is a
sign of pure emotionalism and, thus, a potential sign of an impending reversal. Practically speak-
ing, however, the investor or trader should never attempt to anticipate the reversal. A change in
direction may occur soon, but because the price is changing so rapidly, an attempt to anticipate
the actual price reversal can be disastrous. It is much wiser to watch for the actual reversal and
then act with the comfort of trading with the new trend, rather than against the old one.
Internal Trend Lines
There is also what is called an internal trend line. This line is more difficult to recognize and
has only limited value. Generally, it is a line drawn through trending price action such that a large
number of minor reversals touch the line both from above and below. An example of an internal
trend line is shown in Figure 12.16. In some ways, it appears similar to a regression line that trav-
els through the majority of prices, and in some ways, it appears like a midpoint line between the
two boundaries of a channel. In any case, though it is interesting and occurs often, its use for
trading or investing is limited. The observation that prices often bounce off an internal trend line
may be somewhat useful for very short-term trading, but moving averages provide a better means
of measuring the midpoint in prices as they travel through time.

Retracements
The final subject relating to trends is retracements. As mentioned and observed previously, a
trend rarely follows a line without including a number of smaller trends. The smaller coun-
tertrends are called retracements, and several rules have been developed concerning them.
Retracements are always corrections to the principal trend. As prices rise, for example, in
a strong uptrend, the rise is interrupted periodically by downward corrections. In an uptrend, the
beginning of these corrections is always a resistance point, and the bottom of the retracement is
always a support point. The lower support point is where a new trend line can be plotted from a
previous support point. Thus, a retracement is a smaller trend itself and runs counter to the prin-
cipal trend.
For example, consider the price movement pictured in Figure 12.17. Obviously, the princi-
pal trend for JNJ (Johnson & Johnson) is upward. From late May to early June, the prices follow
this trend, moving upward. However, for most of June, the prices are trending downward in a
countertrend, retracing a portion of the price gain.

A retracement can be analyzed in the same way as the longer trend. It is, in fact, a trend in
itself but with a direction opposite from the principal trend and with a shorter period and length.
Within a trend, many retracements of different amounts and periods can occur. Because the end
of a retracement usually is the support or resistance point for the longer trend, the length and
time of a retracement can tell us something about the longer trend. For example, in a sharply ris-
ing uptrend, you would expect the retracements to be short and not “retrace” a large percentage
of the earlier rise. Indeed, the general rule is that a strong uptrend requires retracements of less

than 50% of the previous uptrend. The same is true for downtrends. Should the retracement in an
uptrend decline more than 50%, the trend line in the longer uptrend would likely be in jeopardy.
Figure 12.17 shows a 50% in the initial upward leg of a longer uptrend in the TYX (30-year U.S.
Treasury Bond interest rate). Thus, the amount of retracement is an indication of the larger
trend’s strength.

FIGURE 12.17 Retracement (TYX daily: August 6, 2009–January 14, 2010)
A retracement, in a healthy trend, can also present an opportunity for the trend follower
who missed the earlier stages of the trend to jump on the longer trend. A retracement, as long as
it holds above the longer trend line and does not retrace more than 50%, is usually an opportu-
nity for the trend follower to act in the direction of the larger trend.
Unfortunately, retracements rarely reach an exact percentage. Some analysts believe that
percentage retracements provide a good entry point. Many articles and books have hypothesized
that in an uptrend or downtrend, prices will tend to retrace a certain percentage. The most com-
mon mentioned are 33 1/3%, 50%, 66 2/3%, and the Fibonacci percentages of 38.2% and 61.8%.
The late Art Merrill, a well-respected technical analyst, in a paper published in the Journal of
Technical Analysis (August 1989), found that the amount by which prices retrace in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average during an advance or decline did not concentrate about any of these per-
centages.
Anticipating retracement levels, therefore, can be somewhat hazardous, and the trade-off
between the amount of retracement desired and what may actually occur is usually unantici-
pated. Thus, a rough estimate from previous retracements, support and resistance zones, and the
location of the longer trend line is probably the best information for an estimate rather than the
mechanical percentage numbers derived from various formulas.

Pullbacks and Throwbacks
Variations of retracements that occur after a breakout, usually from a horizontal support or resist-
ance zone but sometimes from a trend line, are called pullbacks or throwbacks depending on
whether the breakout was downward or upward. When the price retraces quickly back to the
breakout zone from an upward breakout, it is called a throwback, and conversely, the quick
retracement from a break downward is called a pullback (Edwards and Magee, 2007). Figure
12.18 shows a pullback in the U.S. Treasury Bond interest rate. These retracement variations will
become more important when we discuss chart patterns, but they often are found in any breakout,
especially in one from a rectangle formation or congestion area. These retracements may not
abide by normal retracement percentages if they are blocked by the support or resistance level
from which they broke. They tend to be very short in time and distance but often provide a sec-
ond, lesser-risk opportunity for a breakout trader to enter a position.

OTHER TYPES OF TREND LINES
The concept of trend is central to the field of technical analysis. Therefore, analysts have devel-
oped a number of applications and variations of trend lines. Trend lines are not just useful with
bar charts; analysts using point-and-figure charts make use of trend lines. Speed lines, Andrews
Pitchfork, and Gann fan lines are all example of types of trend lines technical analysts use.

Trend Lines on Point-and-Figure Charts
A trend line may be drawn between successive lows or highs in the standard, old-style, point-
and-figure charts, just as they are drawn in a bar or candlestick chart. There is one variation, how-
ever, that occurs in the three-box reversal method. For this type of chart, trend lines are drawn at
45-degree angles (see Figure 12.19). Upward trend lines, called bullish support lines, are drawn
at a 45-degree angle from the lowest low, and downward trend lines, called bearish resistance
lines, are drawn from the last peak. These lines are not really trend lines in the sense that we have
covered earlier, but price penetration through them has very specific meaning. We cover these in
more detail in Chapter 16, “Point-and-Figure Chart Patterns.”

Speed Lines
The late Edson Gould, an early proponent of technical analysis who did extensive market
research, developed a means of estimating future support and resistance by what he called speed
lines. Speed lines are calculated in the instance of an uptrend by taking the low point of the
advance and the high point and creating a box whereby the low point is the lower-left corner and
the high point is the upper-right corner. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 12.20, during a down-
trend, the beginning of the decline (the high point) is the upper-left corner of the box and the low
point is the lower-right corner of the box. The vertical line from the high to the low straight down
from the high is then marked at each third and at the halfway level, and a “speed” line is drawn
from the actual low in the lower-left corner through each of the two marks on the right side and
projected into the future. His hypothesis was that these speed lines were natural levels of support,

and the prices would retrace to them. Modern methods have included marking the Fibonacci ratio
numbers of 38.2% and 61.8% and drawing the speed lines through them. As retracements do not
seem to follow a consistent percentage, it seems doubtful that much merit should be applied to
speed lines, but they are often seen in the literature on technical analysis.

Andrews Pitchfork
Developed by Dr. Alan Andrews, the pitchfork, in a downtrend (see Figure 12.21), takes the ear-
liest high (1), the next minor low (2), and the first major retracement high (3), and then draws a
line between the low and the retracement high (2–3). It then marks the halfway point on that line,
draws a trend line through the earlier high and that mark, extending it into the future, and also
draws parallel lines to that new line from the minor low and from the retracement high. It sounds
complicated, and like the speed line, apparently has limited value in projecting future support
and resistance levels. Users claim that 80% of the time after the pitchfork is formed, prices will
retrace to the middle line (1–A). This has not been tested, however. The method is often seen in
press articles, likely because of the name (similar to candlestick patterns that also have catchy
names), but its usefulness is suspect.

Gann Fan Lines
William Delbert Gann, known as W. D. Gann, was a famous commodities trader and book writer
on trading tactics. He developed a number of technical methods (see Chapter 20, “Elliott,
Fibonacci, and Gann”) that are still used by some practitioners. His invention of fan lines came
from his belief that prices and time were related in a geometric pattern. To construct these lines,
he used nine basic angles of trend lines based on the simple arithmetic relationship between the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. By relating these numbers to a theoretical triangle beginning at an
important price turning point, he could draw a series of trend lines that he thought had meaning.
The angle of the trend line was always a ratio of the numbers converted into degrees. For exam-
ple, he believed that 1 by 1 was the most basic ratio and converted into 45 degrees. From there to
1 by 2 was 63.75 degrees; 1 by 3 was 71.25 degrees, and so forth. Figure 12.22 shows the Gann
fan lines drawn on the TYX chart used earlier for the Andrew’s pitchfork and the Fibonacci
speed lines to give you a comparison between approaches. There is little statistical support for
any of these methods, and you can see that the lines are very similar regardless of the method
used. There appears to be no foolproof method of anticipating trend lines, and the best method is
still to draw a line through the actual price data.

CONCLUSION
The trend of prices is the most important variable in profiting from technical analysis. The trend
can sometimes be obvious and sometimes be elusive. The most useful trends are those identified
the earliest, ridden as long as they last, and the inevitable end recognized. The first step in this
process is observing what trends currently exist. Support and resistance zones determine when
trends have reversed in the past and are a clue as to when they will reverse in the future. Support
and resistance produces troughs and peaks. By connecting with a line from trough to trough and
peak to peak, we can easily plot trend lines that represent past trends and extend them into the
future. From retracements and the breaking of these extended trend lines, we can also spot when
a trend may be changing direction. In the next two chapters, we continue with the discussion of
trends, introducing other methods of measuring them and other signals that can warn of impend-
ing change in price direction.

By the end of this chapter, you should
• Understand what a breakout is ptg
• Be familiar with the major methods of identifying a breakout
• Be familiar with the purpose of entry and exit stops
• Be familiar with the major methods of setting entry and exit stops
In Chapter 12, “Trends—The Basics,” we discussed the importance of trends for profiting from
price action, and we observed several ways in which trends can be recognized. We also learned
that to maximize profit, we must join a trend at its earliest, safest point, and ride it until it shows
signs of changing direction against us. To do this, we mentioned that a trend will begin often
from a breakout of a support or resistance level and sometimes from a trend line. In this chapter,
we discuss breakouts and stops. They are never exact levels and require certain rules for us to
have confidence in their validity. Stops are useful for both entry and exit strategies, and protec-
tive stops are prices at which investors must admit, as difficult as that might be, that their analy-
sis is wrong and that the best solution is to exit from the position. Breakouts and stops are
somewhat similar, although stops need not be as stringent.
BREAKOUTS
A breakout occurs most often when a price “breaks out” through a prior support or resistance
level or zone. A breakout often signals that a significant change in supply and demand has
occurred and that a new price trend is beginning. For this reason alone, a breakout is an
extremely important signal to the investor or trader. A breakout can also occur at a trend line,
which as the previous chapter noted, is just a moving support or resistance level. A breakout in

256 Part III Trend Analysis
the direction of the previous trend is a confirmation that the trend still exists, and a breakout in
the opposite direction of a previous trend suggests that the trend is reversing and that a position
should be closed and possibly reversed. Breakouts occur when prices pass through specific lev-
els. Because these levels are often somewhat unclear zones and because false breakouts are com-
mon, the point at which a breakout occurs is extremely important. Often there must be a trade-off
between speed and conviction. Speed of action is necessary just as a price breaks a level, and
conviction is necessary to be sure that the breakout is real. There are a number of ways to accom-
plish both, but there is always the trade-off between risk and reward. More conviction that the
breakout is real reduces the potential reward, and less conviction, though potentially more prof-
itable, increases the risk that the breakout is false.
How Is Breakout Confirmed?
The first requirement for a breakout is a penetration of a previous trend line, or support or resist-
ance zone. The next requirement is confirmation that the penetration is a real breakout, not a
false one.
When the exact breakout level is not clear, as in a support or resistance zone, the extreme
level of the zone is considered the breakout level. For example, in a trading range with a wide
support zone of horizontal lines from previous support points, the lowest support line would be ptg
the breakout level. The other horizontal lines are also parts of the zone, but prices will often
recede into the support zone without breaking through it entirely. Thus, a break of the lowest sup-
port point is evidence that the entire support zone has been penetrated. A trend line is a more def-
inite breakout level because it is a line, but even with a trend line, a false breakout often occurs
and requires redrawing of the trend line. In both these instances, a penetration of the breakout
level or trend line requires confirmation. Penetrations often occur on an intra-bar basis, and then
the price closes back on the nonbreakout side of the breakout level or trend line. For an example
of an intra-bar penetration, see Figure 13.1. Notice that in late February, the price rose above the
resistance level in intraday trading but closed below. Penetrations of this type are usually false.
Close Filter
The major problem from the analyst’s standpoint is that when the penetration is occurring, there
is usually no other confirming evidence until after the close of trading. Some analysts will act
immediately on the penetration and wait for the confirmation later. This is dangerous because the
odds of a false breakout are greater with just an intra-bar penetration, but the entry can be pro-
tected with a nearby stop. The least risky confirmation is to wait for the closing price to see if,
perhaps, the penetration was just due to an intra-bar exogenous occurrence that had little longer-
term meaning. If the price ends up on the nonbreakout side of the breakout level at the close of
trading, it is plain that the intra-day penetration was likely false and new lines might have to be
drawn to account for it. On the other hand, if the closing price is through the breakout level, the
odds are higher that the breakout is real (see Figure 13.2).
Some traders even wait for two bar closes beyond the breakout level for confirmation. This
increases the risk that some part of the move subsequent to the breakout will be missed, but on
the other hand, it increases the possibility that the breakout is real.

Point or Percent Filter
Another confirmation method is to establish a breakout zone either a certain number or fraction
of points or percentage beyond the breakout level, as pictured in Figure 13.3. The theory is that
if the price can penetrate the breakout level and a prescribed zone beyond it, the penetration must
be real. The number of points or percentage is determined before the penetration and is helpful in
computerized models where a definite breakout price needs to be established. Waiting for the
close after an intra-bar breakout is more difficult to program. The number of points or percentage
can be arbitrarily or empirically derived. Although the signal can use any percent or number of
points, the most commonly used is a 3% rule, a level 3% from the ideal breakout point.
Time
Rather than looking simply at price, this method looks at time since the penetration. The basis is
that if the penetration remains outside the breakout zone for a certain time, it must be real. The
usual time period is two bars, but it can be any length of time. The price must remain beyond, or
at least close beyond, the breakout level for the required number of bars. A combination of the
time rule and the close rule uses both rules. This method requires a penetration and close beyond
the breakout level, and then a second bar in which the price penetrates even further beyond the
breakout level. For example, in a breakout down, the close must be below the breakout level, and ptg
the next bar must have a trade below the previous bar’s low for confirmation of the breakout
down. Figure 13.3 demonstrates this type of breakout to the upside.

Volume
Increased volume of trading often occurs with a breakout. Heavier trading demonstrates that
other market players are acting in the direction of the new trend and that there is sufficient power
behind the penetration. Jiler (1962), however, observes, and cannot explain why, that volume can
dramatically decline on a breakout, and the breakout is still valid. Usually, volume then increases
as the trend develops. In Chapter 15, “Bar Chart Patterns,” we look at volume behavior on the
breakouts from different chart patterns.
Volatility
All of the preceding price rules have obvious drawbacks. The principal drawback to most of
these methods is that they don’t account for the price volatility of the security. By nature, some
stocks tend to be characterized by more volatile trading; for these stocks, a more significant price
move can be expected without it signaling a breakout. Remember that a filter using just the close
doesn’t require that the close be any distance from the breakout level. In highly volatile stocks,
for example, the close can vary from a trend line or breakout level by a considerable amount and
still not be a valid breakout.
A filter rule that uses some arbitrary point or percentage rule is likely to be broken by a
highly volatile security before a true breakout occurs. In this case, analysts may consider the ptg
price volatility of the security when determining what the filter for a legitimate breakout should
be. Three means of calculating volatility are most often used; these are beta, standard deviation
of price, and Average True Range (ATR).
Beta is a calculation of the standard deviation of price relative to a market proxy, usually
the S&P 500. It is not useful in commodities because commodities have little useful correlation
to the stock market or a commodity average. Indeed, beta’s use has diminished over the years, as
the underlying assumption that it is a valid measure of risk has been questioned. It does have one
advantage in that it eliminates the trend of the market from the volatility calculation.
Standard deviation of price is the basis for most option and other derivative models and
uses the complete set of prices over some past period in time. Its usefulness as a breakout filter is
diminished by the fact that it includes the trend of the security in its calculation. The breakout fil-
ter must use the volatility about the trend and not include the trend itself. Otherwise, a strongly
trending stock with little volatility about its trend would have a higher filter than a flat-trending
stock with wide fluctuations about its mean.
ATR is a derivation of the Average Range, which is just the average of the difference
between each bar high and low over some past period. The ATR is calculated using a special for-
mula devised by Wilder himself to reduce the effects of older data (see Chapter 14, “Moving
Averages”). The ATR is an average of the True Range bar’s close (Wilder, 1978). In doing so, it
includes whatever effect a price gap between bars might have on the security’s volatility. The
True Range is the greatest of

==================================================

260 Part III Trend Analysis
• The absolute value of the difference between the prior bar close and the current bar
low
The ATR is the average of the True Range over some time period. Being dependent solely
on the price of the security, the ATR is not influenced by any other average or security and is,
thus, pure to the security’s own action. It includes the recent trend only so far as the trend has had
an effect on the range of prices. ATR is an excellent measure of volatility and is used in many
indicators as well as breakout and stop-loss formulas.
As a price filter for confirmation of a breakout, by including a multiple of the ATR, the
breakout level is adjusted for the volatility of the security. As you can see in Figure 13.4, an ATR
filter expands and contracts over time as price volatility changes. For example, if price volatility
increases, daily True Ranges will expand, and the ATR will be larger, making it less likely to
have a false breakout due to the increased price volatility. This means that a highly volatile secu-
rity will have a wider filter to account for its likelihood of making false breakouts just because of
its higher volatility. On the other hand, a dull security that has few wild moves will have a narrow
filter that will trigger the breakout with only a minimum deviation from its usual range.

Pivot Point Technique
The Pivot Point Technique is a method of determining likely support and resistance levels. It is
widely used by day traders to establish potential price ranges for the day, and it is used as confir-
mation for breakouts (see Figure 13.5).

FIGURE 13.5 Pivot Point technique filter (DJIA intra-day: June 29, 2010–July 2, 2010)
This technique uses the previous bar’s high, low, and close to establish support and resistance
levels for the current bar. Some formulas use the open as well. A series of points called pivot points
for the current bar are calculated from price points derived from the previous bar. The theory behind
using this technique is that as time goes on, the effect of past prices on current prices diminishes.
Thus, the most recent, previous bar’s action is the best predictor of the current bar’s action.
This technique uses the following formula (Kaufman, 1998):
P (pivot point) = (High previous bar + Low previous bar + Close previous bar) ÷ 3
R1 (first resistance) = (2 ×P) – Low previous bar
S1 (first support) = (2 ×P) – High previous bar
R2 (second resistance) = (P + High previous bar – Low previous bar)
S2 (second support) = (P – High previous bar + Low previous bar)
These calculations establish upper and lower levels at which prices are expected to meet
resistance or support based on the previous period’s action. Floor traders will then enter or exit
trades around these calculated pivot levels. The use of this formula is, of course, questionable
because the logic behind it is questionable. The reason that so many intraday price reversals
occur at pivot points is likely because so many traders use them, and, thus, they become self-ful-
filling. In Figure 13.5, you can see that for the three days shown, the pivot points did not provide
much guidance.
Traders looking for the validity of daily breakouts, on the other hand, will use the previous
week or month action to establish current expected resistance and support levels; a price break
through a current actual resistance or support level would be confirmed if it also broke a pivot

resistance or support level. As a method of confirming breakouts, the logic behind their use is a
little more solid. The formula is essentially a measure of the previous day’s volatility projected
into the following day. Volatility, as we have seen previously, is a useful method for determining
accurate breakout confirmations.
Alternative pivot point calculations exist as well as the standard above. Tom DeMark
developed a means of predicting support and resistance based on adding the relationship between
the open and close price. There are also Woodie’s and Camarilla pivot point formulas. When all
of these methods are compared, not one seems to be consistent or accurately estimate future sup-
port or resistance levels.
Can a Breakout Be Anticipated?
So far, we have looked at ways of confirming a breakout after it has occurred. Is it possible to
determine that a breakout is about to occur before it actually does? Sometimes it is possible to
anticipate a breakout. Often, volume is a clue that a breakout is about to occur. As we will learn
later, volume often accompanies the trend. In other words, an increase in volume with a trend is
supportive of that trend. Thus, when prices are oscillating, for example, beneath a resistance zone
and volume increases on every small up leg and decreases with every small down leg, the odds
favor that the price will eventually break up through the resistance zone. ptg
Prices can also give a hint as to their next directional move. For example, in a trading
range, if prices begin to reverse upward at a level slightly above the lower boundary of the range
and then reverse downward right at the resistance zone, it indicates that buyers are becoming a
little more aggressive with every minor correction and are willing to pay just a little more for the
security. If this tendency to have slightly rising lows is accompanied by increasing volume on the
rallies, the probability of an upward breakout through resistance increases.
Figure 13.6 gives a hypothetical example of price activity hinting that a breakout may soon
occur. Resistance has existed in the past and has stopped the first price rally. A downward rever-
sal takes place to the point marked C. If volume increased on the initial rise to resistance but
declined on the correction to C, C becomes a possible entry point in anticipation of a breakout
above resistance. This is a low-odds, riskier entry point because the chances of it failing to follow
with an actual breakout are considerably greater than after an actual breakout has occurred, but
the price at which entry is made is lower, and, thus, the trade, if it works out, is potentially more
profitable. A trade-off exists between the higher risk of entry prior to the breakout and the higher
reward of a cheaper entry price. At B, assuming again that volume has increased with the small
rally, the odds of a breakout have increased over C, but the price is not quite as advantageous. At
A, we know that a breakout has occurred, and, thus, our risk of a failure has diminished (but has
not been eliminated because false breakouts can still occur), but the price of entry is considerably
higher than the other possible entry points. This trade-off between risk and reward is a constant
problem for the analyst, and the decision as to which breakout method to use is entirely at the
analyst’s discretion, based on individual reward/risk tolerance. Deciding on the most comfort-
able relation between risk and reward is a problem that will arise in almost every technical situa-
tion, from breakouts to money management, and it is one of the reasons that evaluating technical
systems is so difficult.

STOPS
A stop order is an order to buy or sell once a specific price has been reached. For example, a buy ptg
stop would be an order to buy a security at a specified price above the current price. Should the
price rise to the specified buy stop price, it will be bought at the market. Conversely, a sell stop is
an order to sell a security at a specified price below the current price when reached.
What Are Entry and Exit Stops?
Stop orders, also called “stops,” can be used to enter a position or to exit a position. For example,
if a price is approaching a resistance level above which a new trend is expected to develop, a buy
stop order could be placed to be triggered if the resistance level is penetrated in a breakout. Or
conversely, at a support level, the entry stop order could be placed to sell short once the specified
level had been breached. These examples are entry stops. Exit stops are used either to protect
capital from further loss, what Edwards and Magee (2007) call protective stops, or to protect
profits from deteriorating back into a loss, usually called trailing stops. These stops are defen-
sive in nature and are an absolute necessity once a trade entry has occurred.
Breakout levels and stop-loss levels or zones are very similar. Exit stop levels are levels
that signal the analysis might be incorrect or at least that the analysis is uncertain and that a posi-
tion should be exited to protect capital but not necessarily reentered in the opposite direction.
Entry stop levels are positioned using the preceding rules for establishing a breakout level or
zone or anticipation of a breakout through those levels or zones. The methods described previ-
ously for confirming breakouts are equally useful in confirming stop levels.
In an entry stop at a breakout level, an investor is committing new money and taking the
risk that the breakout is valid. In an exit stop, an investor is closing a position and, thus, not
decreasing risk. This is not to say that stops should be used carelessly. Indeed, by placing stops
too close to current price action, an investor can be easily “whipsawed.” A whipsaw occurs when
an investor buys a security, the security price falls, the investor sells the security, and then the

security price goes up above the original purchase price. The investor’s original opinion was cor-
rect, but he or she still lost money. The word “whipsaw” comes from the timber industry where a
long, thin, two-man wood saw would often get caught in a log, if not properly handled, and whip
the sawyers back and forth without cutting the wood and subjecting them to “two damaging and
usually opposing forces at the same time” (www.Randomhouse.com). The whipsaw resulted
from lack of analysis and lack of patience, just as in investing.
Changing Stop Orders
The most important underlying principle for defensive stops, because they protect one’s capital
but at the same time may imply the original analysis was wrong, is that they should never be
moved away from the trend of the security. In other words, if one is long a security and has
placed a stop at a reasonable level below the current price, he should never cancel or reduce the
stop order. Its purpose is to keep the investor honest. By changing or canceling the stop, espe-
cially when the security is trading at a loss, the investor is losing discipline and reacting to emo-
tional pressures having to do with not desiring to admit an error, a natural and strong human
emotion, but unrelated to the rational assessment of the price action. If a decision about the secu-
rity originally is made with the best logic and information available and a stop is placed at that
time at the point at which the analysis will obviously be incorrect, changing it or canceling it ptg
negates all the original thought and analysis. The stop may be adjusted along with price as a trail-
ing stop or one that follows each successive change in support or resistance in the direction of the
trend as the position progresses profitably, but it should never be canceled or changed against the
trend.
Many investors and traders place stops too close to the current price of the security in
which they have a position. This often causes whipsaws, even when the stop is adjusted for
volatility. A defensive stop is a protection device. It is not necessary for short-term trading.
Often, because they don’t want to lose any amount of profit, investors will place a stop too close
to the current price and get closed out too early in a longer move. A better method is to allow the
security “breathing” room and place the protective stop below where the breathing room correc-
tion would be serious. We know that security prices retrace their advances in a progression of
steps along the trend, and we know that we will never buy and sell at the absolute peak or trough.
We also know that we have to decide upon what time horizon we want to play. Once that is
decided, to place a stop based on a shorter time period only invites whipsaws. It is better to wait
for the retracement and let the security “breathe.”
On the other hand, if the situation is such that the overall market appears ready to reverse,
and one’s security has run along with the market but is also showing signs of fatigue, a trailing
stop very close to the current price is sometimes warranted. When the situation is such that a
position will likely be closed soon anyway, for whatever reason, tightening the stop just allows
the marketplace to make the decision rather than the investor or trader.
What Are Protective Stops?
Whenever a position is initiated, usually even before initiation, a protective exit stop level must
be determined and placed with the entry order. The reasons are twofold. First, the protective stop

==================================================

Chapter 13 Breakouts, Stops, and Retracements 265
protects capital. Not every entry is correct and ends up with a profit. Indeed, many traders have
more losing trades than winning trades, but they are able to profit because of the judicious use of
their stops. They place protective stops at a level at which they know the trade will have been
unsuccessful, and when a trade works, they run with the profits until the trend appears to be
reversing. The protective stop, therefore, is necessary in any investment endeavor. Even standard
fundamental analysis should use some kind of stop. It is ridiculous to think that when entering a
trade or investment that it will always be successful and that risk of loss should be disregarded.
The second reason a protective stop is necessary is to determine what capital risk the trader
or investor is accepting in the trade. By establishing a stop level (and placing an order to that
effect), the investors now know exactly what capital risk is being taken. Assume that a stock
breaks upward out of a resistance zone at $20, and the entry stop is triggered so that the investor
is now invested in the stock at $20. By analyzing previous support, trend lines, and other techni-
cal data, the investor determines that if the stock should sink to $17 (perhaps that is a support
level or a trend line level adjusted for confirmation), there is something wrong with the analysis
that suggested that the price would be rising. The need to know what is wrong is unnecessary
because the stock price action itself is suggesting that something is wrong. Rational investment
management would then be to get out of the stock until what is wrong is understood and evalu-
ated. Technical analysis tells the investor at what price this exit should be made. Once the $17
price is determined as the exit point, the risk of the trade has been determined to be $3, the dif- ptg
ference between the entry and potential exit prices. Knowing that the risk is $3 makes the money
management problem considerably easier. Say the investor has $100,000 and never wants to risk
more than 10% of capital in any one investment. A 3,300 share position with the risk of losing $3
is a $10,000 risk in a $100,000 portfolio, or 10%. No other investment method is as useful for
measuring risk of loss. If the best exit point was $16 rather than $17, the risk would be $4 per
share and the ideal position to limit loss to 10% of the portfolio would then have been 2,500
shares. By knowing the risk level, the investor can adjust the amount of shares to be purchased.
This method provides a tremendous advantage in reducing risk.
All stops should be placed based on the price action of the security and the level at which
a reversal in trend is likely. Generally, these are trend lines or support or resistance levels. The
methods using percentages or points from entry do not address the action of the price and are not
adjusted to it. Instead, these levels are purely arbitrary. These rules will often stop out a position
before a crucial level is reached or long after it has been penetrated. Exits always should be
placed at logical levels of price based on the analysis of trend, support and resistance, volatility,
and pattern, not on the peculiarities of a particular portfolio or on an arbitrary rule.
What Are Trailing Stops?
When a security is in a recognizable trend, a trailing stop can be used to avoid the potential loss
of profits. Edwards and Magee called these stops “progressive” stops. These trailing stops are
necessary because, for instance, in a significant uptrend, the prior support or resistance level may
become a substantial price distance from the current price. For example, consider Figure 13.7.
Assume that you initially enter a long position in October, with a protective stop placed at the
low October price. As the stock continues trading in an uptrend over time, the price gets further
and further from this initial stop point. By December, you have made a substantial profit. Setting

a trailing stop will help you lock in that profit if the uptrend reverses. If you kept the stop at the
original October level, you could watch the price fall by a large amount, and your profits would

Trailing Stops Using a Trend Line
The easiest method of establishing a trailing stop is to follow the trend line with a confirmation
filter similar to those used in standard breakouts, as shown in Figure 13.7. For example, an
uptrending stock has a definite, well-defined, standard trend line drawn beneath the recent price
history. By setting a stop level below the trend line, to prevent false signals, using the amount
determined from any of the preceding breakout confirmation methods—for example, a 3% fil-
ter—you establish a trailing stop. It must be adjusted with every new bar to travel along with the
trend line. If it is triggered and the position closed, profits already accrued would not be appre-
ciably affected, at least not as much as waiting for a previous support or resistance level to be
broken would adversely affect them, yet the stop level is far enough away from the trend line so
as not to be triggered with a false breakout.
Another method of trailing stop designed to account for the intrinsic volatility of the secu-
rity is to measure some fraction of the security’s ATR from its latest reversal point. This method is
called a “Chandelier Exit.” For example, assume you are long a security rising on an accelerated
trend that reaches $50. The 14-day ATR for this stock is $2.50. Based on an evaluation of the mar-
ket strength, you decide to place a stop three times the ATR below the recent highest high. (Usu-
ally a multiple of 2.5 to 4.0 times the ATR is used.) Therefore, you place a sell stop at $42.50. You
don’t consider the trend line or the previous support level, which may be considerably below the
current price. This method provides a stop based purely on the price and volatility of the security.

Chapter 13 Breakouts, Stops, and Retracements 267
When price rises above $50, the stop moves up with the price rise to three times its new ATR
below the new high. Figure 13.8 shows what using the Chandelier Exit looks like. Using this
method reduces the likelihood that a false breakdown will occur because you are adjusting the
stop for the security’s volatility. This method is especially useful when other levels such as a trend
line or support level are considerably distant from the current price, and the security is following
an accelerated upward trend whose end is difficult to predict.

Trailing Stops Using Parabolic SAR
Another trend-following method for setting stops is the Parabolic SAR. (SAR stands for “Stop
and Reversal.”) Developed by Welles Wilder (1978), it was initially intended as a trading system
because it required a long or short position. However, it has become not only a breakout confir-
mation rule, but also an excellent, but sometimes very sensitive, stop rule.
The Parabolic is calculated by using an “acceleration factor” that increases as the price
moves along its trend. Thus, the name “parabolic” is used because the stop level follows a para-
bolic curve, as shown in Figure 13.9. The weakness of the formula is that it doesn’t include the
security’s volatility and is thus subject to many whipsaws. The acceleration factor is arbitrary
and requires some testing for each security to find the best level with the least whipsaws. The
concept of a parabolic curve for a stop level is an interesting one, however, and once adjusted for
a security’s volatility may have more value.

Trailing Stops Using Percentage of Gain
One final method of determining trailing stops is to place stops at a percentage of each leg in the
direction of the trend. This requires that a profit is accruing. On the initial favorable leg, for
example, a stop can be placed at 50% of the gain and moved with the gain until after the first
retracement. The stop can then be raised as a higher fraction of each successive favorable leg.
This method is generally inferior to those methods based on the actual price action.
What Are Time Stops?
Time stops are exit stops used to close a position after a predetermined period of time has passed.
Time is an investor’s enemy. Uncertainty increases in future time. The longer we look into the
future, the less accurate our projections are. This uncertainty is one reason why long-term inter-
est rates are usually higher than short-term interest rates—to account for the risk of something
adverse happening over time. When a trading model or investment method determines that a
position should be entered, for whatever reason, the longer that time goes on without a profitable
reaction to the position entry, the higher are the chances that the entered position will be unprof-
itable. Technical analysis is a method of timing investments or trades. To maximize return on
capital, capital should not be idle. For this reason, technical analysts often use a time stop to exit
a position after a predetermined time, especially if the position is not profitable. Time stops are
also useful in testing mechanical trading methods. All positions must have an entry and exit.
Often one is unrelated to the other, but without the ability to analyze both the entry and exit, their

respective strengths and weaknesses are unknown. To analyze the signal entry, a time stop gives
equal weight to all the entry signals being tested.
What Are Money Stops?
Instead of using price points at which risk of significant loss is possible, some traders and
investors use a money stop. This stop is based on the risk one is willing to take in terms of money.
For example, in the previous description of the protective stop, the investor was willing to risk
$10,000. Instead of determining from the analysis at what point the security is at risk of major
loss, the investor determines how far down the security may decline before the $10,000 is lost.
With this method, investors enter into an arbitrary number of shares at their choosing without any
analysis of the price point at which the position should be closed and then allow the balance in
their investment account to tell them when to sell. From the strategic and money management
viewpoint, this method is a poor way to establish a protective stop. The better method is to deter-
mine the risk points in the security and work from there. A money stop is based not only on the
price change but also on the amount of securities or contracts entered. It is, thus, not a good
method of determining when the chance of further loss has increased and will often cause expen-
sive whipsaws, especially if the position has a large number of shares or contracts and is exited
after only a small change in price. ptg
As you can see, there are numerous variations of stops. The technical analyst usually tests
a variety on the securities being traded and sticks with the most successful method.
How Can Stops Be Used with Breakouts?
A breakout above resistance or below support signals a change, usually in trend direction. A
trend line breakout is a warning of change but not necessarily of a reversal in direction. The most
used breakout is the breakout from support or resistance. In Chapter 15, we cover chart patterns.
Almost all patterns are made of trend lines and support or resistance lines. The most reliable
chart patterns are completed on a breakout, usually through support or resistance. Most strategies
utilizing chart patterns, therefore, must have a way of recognizing a breakout, measuring its
importance, and confirming it.
Using Stops When Gaps Occur
Some traders act directly on the breakout and are willing to pay the extra price generated by the
enthusiasm associated with the breakout. This is usually a wise decision when the breakout cre-
ates a gap (see Gap A in Figure 13.10). A gap occurs when a security opens and trades at a range
totally outside the previous day’s range. In other words, there is no overlap between one day’s
trading prices and the previous day’s trading prices, and a gap appears between the bars for the
two days on a chart. A gap is usually a sign that important information was released during the
period between the bars that had an extraordinary effect on the buyers and sellers. Usually, if the
reason for the gap is legitimate, the price continues in the direction in which it broke out. When
the gap is closed (“covered” or “filled”), however, there is the danger that the gap was false and
prices will reverse their trend. Thus, a protection stop should be placed below the gap opening.
We discuss the different kinds of gaps in Chapter 17, “Short-Term Patterns.”

FIGURE 13.10 Gaps (DIS daily: September 4, 2009–February 3, 2010)
Waiting for Retracement
When a breakout occurs, but a gap is not present, some traders will wait for the pullback or
throwback before entering a position. To do this, they wait for the initial run from the breakout to
exhaust itself, calculate a percentage—usually 50%—retracement from the breakout to the high
or low, and place a limit order at that level. A breakout followed by a pullback is pictured in Fig-
ure 13.11. Studies have shown (Thom Hartle, Active Trader Magazine, March 2004) that the per-
centage retracement is not predictable and varies widely. Thus, these traders run the risk that the
security will not retrace the percentage or will retrace the percentage and continue correcting
back to the original stop level. To prevent this, once the percentage retracement level is deter-
mined and the limit order is placed, the stop is adjusted to just behind the limit order to prevent
the retracement from becoming a large loss if it continues. Often the trader will also enter a par-
tial position on the breakout and a partial position at the expected retracement level with a stop
for the entire position just behind it. This way, the risk of missing the security continuing beyond
its breakout without a retracement is reduced, and should the retracement occur, a full position
will be entered at a lower average price.

Calculating a Risk/Return Ratio for Breakout Trading
Usually breakouts from support or resistance run to the next zone of support or resistance. This
gives the investor or trader a price objective for the breakout. From that price objective, a
risk/return ratio can be calculated. The return is the difference between the entry price and the
price objective. The risk is the amount the price must go against the entry price before exited on
a stop, usually some price on the other side of the breakout. Traditionally, the reward/risk ratio
should be a minimum of three to one. This gives the investor the odds of making money even
when two out of three trades fail, assuming the third action provides a three-to-one gain. In
Chapter 15, “Bar Chart Patterns,” and Chapter 16, “Point-and-Figure Chart Patterns,” we learn
other methods of determining a price objective. This three-to-one guideline, however, should
always be the minimum reward/risk ratio. Anything less than three to one increases the odds of
losing money beyond acceptable amounts.
In Figure 13.12, we show the support levels and how the price subsequent to a downward
breakout tends to run to the next support level. Once a downward breakout occurs, the objective
is the next support level from the previous advance. Depending on where the trade is entered and
what level is necessary for a stop, a calculation can easily be made as to the reward/risk of the
trade. Notice in this chart that the trader had a second chance on every downward breakout. The
price rallied back to the breakout almost immediately in a pullback, and then it declined again to
the next support level. Such pullbacks do not occur frequently, but the odds of returning to an
earlier support level are generally good.

FIGURE 13.12 Breakouts to support levels (X daily: January 15, 2010–July 2, 2010)
Placing Stops for a False (or “Specialist”) Breakout
Figure 13.13 shows an example of a downward “specialist breakout.” This false breakout triggers
all the sell stops placed to protect against a loss from a reversal in upward trend or to enter a new
short position. Prices, with no follow-through, then reverse again, and they break back up
through the earlier breakout level, leaving many investors with a loss. Those who sold their longs
on a protective stop no longer have a position, and those who entered a short position now have
a loss. The false breakout down caught them. It is often called a specialist breakout from the days
when specialists and market makers would create false breakouts at prices known to be strong
support or resistance levels and establish a position with the longer trend—in the example, the
uptrend. Thus, the breakout downward in Figure 13.13, against the longer upward trend, trig-
gered sellers who sold their stock to the specialists or market makers, who then held for the con-
tinuation of the earlier trend. Whether these false breakouts are manipulations today is somewhat
irrelevant, but they do occur quite frequently and, if not protected against, can be very painful.
To protect against these losses, the astute investor or trader will place another, close buy
stop (in the example) slightly above the high of the breakout bar, as drawn on the chart. If prices
quickly reverse upward, the trader will cover losses and make a profit from the second stop being
triggered, and the earlier long investor will be long again.
The reaction to a specialist breakout is often so strong and dramatic because it has trapped
investors in the wrong direction. In itself, it is a tradable formation. In the chart example, should the
trader have no position but see the downward breakout, rather than trade the breakout, he or she
could place a stop above the breakout bar in case the breakout is false. If the breakout is false and
triggers the trader’s entry stop, he or she makes a quick profit, and if it does not trigger, he or she
doesn’t lose anything. A trader who was fooled by the false breakout could also use this procedure

for a stop and reverse. If the short is entered on the downward breakout, the buy stop would be
placed at the upper level of the breakout bar to close the short position and to enter a long position.
In the example, you can see that the triggered stop would have produced a sizable profit.

FIGURE 13.13 Stop for specialist breakout (DIS daily: July 2, 2008–October 9, 2008)
The most important point about trailing stops, or any kind of stop, is to test the method
first. It is remarkable how much a stop, if properly placed, can improve performance over that
from just an arbitrary stop placement.
CONCLUSION
Breakouts from support, resistance, or trend lines are the primary signal that the price has
changed direction or is reaccelerating in its original direction. As such, breakouts are usually the
first signal to act. Because breakouts can be false, and often are, some means of confirming a
breakout is necessary. We have covered a few methods but none of them is foolproof. The tech-
nical analyst must experiment with different methods and find those most satisfactory to his
method of trading or investing. The same can be said for stops. Although stops need not be as
precise, they are always necessary when a position has been entered, and they must never be can-
celed or changed until they are triggered or the position is closed. Their purpose is to keep the
investor honest and solvent. The rules for breakouts apply equally to stops. They should account
for either previous support or resistance or trend, should adjust for the security’s volatility, and
should not be placed too close to the current price as to invite a false signal or whipsaw.

One of the most successful methods of identifying and profiting from trends is the use of moving
averages. A moving average is a constant period average, usually of prices, that is calculated for
each successive chart period interval. The result, when plotted on a price chart, shows a smooth
line representing the successive, average prices. Moving averages dampen the effects of short-
term oscillations. Many of the most successful technical investment managers use moving aver-
ages to determine when trends are changing direction. Moving averages are especially useful in
markets that have a tendency to trend.
Moving averages have been tested by academics and shown to have statistical significance.
Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992) were the first to demonstrate, using modern statistical
bias-reducing methods, that moving average crossover signals have intrinsic value. As with most
academic studies, the results of Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron’s have been somewhat contro-
versial. Even though some have since criticized their study, other researchers have validated their
results. (Incidentally, the Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron study provides one of the more use-
ful arguments against the Random Walk and Efficient Markets hypotheses.) Although the Brock,
Lakonishok, and LeBaron study focused on the Dow Jones Industrials, later studies have used
moving average crossover systems for market data in other countries with generally the same
positive results. Detry and Gregoire (2001) provided a summary of these studies.

276 Part III Trend Analysis
There obviously is something to moving averages. Traders and trend investors, of course,
have known all this for many years, but technical analysts now feel more comfort in what they
have been doing. In this chapter, we discuss some of the moving average methods and strategies
that technical analysts use, as well as introduce some variations on moving averages, such as
Bollinger Bands, envelopes, and directional movement indicators.
WHAT IS A MOVING AVERAGE?
The moving average is one of the oldest tools used by technical analysts. Daily fluctuations in
stock prices, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates can be large. Moving averages tone
down these fluctuations—deemphasizing but sometimes distorting fluctuations. Technical ana-
lysts use moving averages to smooth erratic data, making it easier to view the true underlying
trend.
The principal reason that moving averages are used is to smooth out shorter fluctuations
and focus on the trend that fits with the investor’s time horizon. A moving average by its nature
is just one number that represents a net of certain past numbers. For example, a 20-day moving
ptg
average is one number that represents all the prices for the past 20 days. As such, it filters out
each one of the prices during the past 20 days and tells us how the group of 20 days is behaving,
rather than its separate parts.
HOW IS A SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE CALCULATED?
Table 14.1 contains the daily closing prices for CLB (Core Laboratories) from May 10, 2010
through July 12, 2010. Most moving averages of prices are based on closing prices, but they can
be calculated on highs, lows, daily means, or any other value as long as the price type is consis-
tent throughout the calculations. We use closing prices.

278 Part III Trend Analysis
The most commonly used type of moving average is the simple moving average (SMA),
sometimes referred to as an arithmetic moving average. An SMA is constructed by adding a set
of data and then dividing by the number of observations in the period being examined. For exam-
ple, look at the ten-day SMA in Table 14.1. We begin by summing the closing prices for the first
ten days. We then divide this sum by 10 to give us the mean price for that ten-day period. Thus,
on the tenth day, the ten-day simple moving average would be the mean closing price for CLB
for Days 1 through 10, or $140.16.1
On Day 11, the moving average changes. To calculate the moving average for Day 11, we
calculate the mean price for Days 2 through 11. In other words, the closing price for Day 1 is
dropped from the data set, while the price for Day 11 is added. The formula for calculating a ten-
day simple moving average is as follows:
10
Σ
SMA data / 10
10 i
i =1
Of course, we can construct moving averages of different lengths. In Table 14.1, you can
also see a 26-day moving average. This SMA is simply calculated by adding the 26 most recent
closing prices and dividing by 26.
ptg
Although a moving average can smooth prices over any desired period, some of the more
popular daily moving averages are for the periods 200, 60, 50, 30, 20, and 10 days. These peri-
ods are somewhat arbitrary and were chosen in the days before computers when the calculations
had to be done by hand or on a crank adding machine. Gartley (1935), for example, used the 200-
day moving average in his work. Simple, round numbers were easier to calculate. Also, the 10-
day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages summarize approximately two weeks, one month, and
three months (one fiscal quarter) of trading data, respectively.
Once calculated, moving averages are plotted on a price chart. Figure 14.1 shows a plot of
the 26-day simple moving average for CLB. From mid-June through mid-July, the moving aver-
age is an upward sloping curve, indicating an upward trend in Core Labs’s price. The daily fluc-
tuations are smoothed by the moving average so that the analyst can see the underlying trend
without being distracted by the small, daily movements.
A rising moving average indicates an upward trend, while a falling moving average indi-
cates a downward trend. Although the moving average helps us discern a trend, it does so after
the trend has begun. Thus, the moving average is a lagging indicator. By definition, the moving
average is an indicator that is based on past prices. For example, Figure 14.1 shows an upward
trend in CLB beginning in late May. However, an upward movement in the SMA does not occur
until approximately mid-June. Remember that according to technical analysis principles, we
want to be trading with the trend. Using a moving average will always give us some delay in sig-
naling a change in trend.
1. Of course, being able to calculate a ten-day average requires ten days of data. Data occurring before the period shown
in the chart was used to calculate the ten-day moving average for May 10–May 20. Our discussion centers on the calcu-
lation of the moving average for Day 10 so that the reader can follow the steps necessary to do such a calculation.

Length of Moving Average
Because moving averages can be calculated for various lengths of time, which length is best to
use? Of course, a longer time period includes more data observations, and, thus, more informa-
tion. By including more data in the calculation of the moving average, each day’s data becomes
relatively less important in the calculation. Therefore, a large change in the value on one day
does not have a large impact on the longer moving average. This can be an advantage if this large
change is a one-day, irregular outlier in the data.
However, if this large move represents the beginning of a significant change in the trend, it
takes longer for the underlying trend change to be discernable. Thus, the longer moving average
is slower to pick up trend changes but less likely to falsely indicate a trend change due to a short-
term blip in the data.
Figure 14.2, for example, shows both a 13-day and a 26-day SMA plotted for CLB. Notice
how the shorter, 13-day moving average shows more variability than the longer, 26-day moving
average. The 26-day moving average is said to be the “slower” moving average. Although it pro-
vides more smoothing, the 26-day smoothing average is also slower at signaling underlying trend
changes. Notice how the 13-day SMA troughs in early June, signaling a change in trend; a week
later, the slower, 26-day SMA is flat but and gradually turning upward. Thus, the 26-day SMA is
slower to indicate a trend change.
Because spotting a trend reversal as soon as possible maximizes trading profits, the 13-day
SMA may first appear to give superior information; however, remember that the faster SMA has
a disadvantage of potentially giving a false signal of a changing trend direction. For example,
look at early July in Figure 14.2. The 13-day SMA flattens out, suggesting an end to the upward
price trend. After the fact, however, we can see that a trend reversal did not occur in early July.

2010–July 13, 2010)
Using Multiple Moving Averages
Analysis is not limited to the information provided by a single moving average. Considering var-
ious moving averages of various lengths simultaneously can increase the analysts’ information
set. For example, as shown in Figure 14.2, a support or resistance level often occurs where two
moving averages cross. Where the shorter moving average crosses above the longer is often
taken as a mechanical buy signal, or at least a sign that the price trend is upward. Likewise, it is
considered a sell signal when the shorter declines below the longer. Many successful moving
average strategies use moving averages as the principal determinant of trend and then use
shorter-term moving averages either as trailing stops or as signals. In some instances, moving
averages are used to determine trend, and then chart patterns are used as entry and exit signals.
Using these types of dual moving average signals during a sideways trend in prices, how-
ever, can result in a number of whipsaws. This problem can be seen in Figure 14.3. This is essen-
tially the same problem that occurs during the standard sideways trend in a congestion area. It is
very difficult to determine from such action in which way prices are going to break out, and
meanwhile they oscillate back and forth within the support and resistance levels. A moving aver-
age provides no additional information on which way the trend will eventually break. Indeed, a
moving average requires a trend for a crossover to be profitable. This means that the analyst must
be sure that a trend exists before using moving average crossovers for signals. Otherwise—and

some traders are willing to take the risk of short-term whipsaws in order not to miss the major
trend—a plurality of signals will be incorrect and produce small losses while waiting for the one
signal that will produce the large profit. This can be a highly profitable method provided the ana-
lyst has the stomach and discipline to continue with the small losses, and it often is the basis for
many long-term trend systems. It also demonstrates how, with proper discipline, one can profit
while still losing on a majority of small trades.

WHAT OTHER TYPES OF MOVING AVERAGES ARE USED?
Although we have discussed various lengths of moving averages, up to this point our discussion
has centered on the most basic type of moving average calculation—the SMA. Remember that
each day’s calculation of the SMA represents adding the most recent day’s price figure and drop-
ping the earliest day’s price figure. When calculating the simple moving average, equal weight is
given to each daily observation. For a ten-day SMA, the information contained in the stock price
for each of the ten days is given equal importance. However, in certain situations, the most recent
stock price may have more bearing on the future direction of the stock than the ten-day old stock
price does. If observations that are more recent contain more relevant information than earlier
observations, we want to weight data in favor of the most recent observation. By calculating a
weighted moving average, the most recent day’s information is weighted more heavily. This
weighting scheme gives the most recent observation more importance in the moving average cal-
culation.

282 Part III Trend Analysis
The Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA)
Let us refer back to the example in Table 14.1 to calculate a linearly weighted moving average. A
ten-day linearly weighted moving average multiplies the tenth day observation by 10, the ninth
day by 9, the eighth day by 8, and so forth. The total of these numbers are added up and divided
by the sum of all the multipliers. In this case, the total will be divided by the sum 10 + 9 + 8 + 7
+ 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1, or 55. In Table 14.1, we find that the linearly weighted moving average
for the first ten trading days is 138.56.
When using this ten-day moving average weighting scheme, the most recent trading data
(Day 10) is given twice the importance of the price five days earlier (Day 5) and ten times the
importance of the price ten days earlier (Day 1). As we go on to calculate the ten-day linearly
weighted moving average for Day 11, the prices for trading Days 2–10 again will be weighted.
Therefore, just as with the simple moving average, as the moving average is calculated for each
successive day, the earliest trading day information is dropped from the data set being used in the
calculation.
The Exponentially Smoothed Moving Average (EMA)
ptg
For some analysts, dropping off the earliest trading day’s data that occurs with an SMA or lin-
early weighted moving average is problematic. If the most recent price reflects little change, but
the earliest price, now being omitted, shows considerable change, the moving average can be
unduly influenced by the discarding of the older data. A large change in the moving average that
results from the deletion of early data potentially generates a false signal. This is called the
“drop-off effect” (Kaufman, 1998) and is probably the most criticized aspect of a simple moving
average.
Although it is easy to see how this very early data is not necessarily as important in deter-
mining future price movement as the most recent prices, it is still information that may have
value. With both the simple moving average and the linearly weighted moving average, this older
information, which lies outside of the length of the moving average, is being totally ignored. To
address this issue and maintain this older information in the moving average calculation, analysts
use the exponential moving average.
To see how the exponential moving average is calculated, let us again refer to the example
in Table 14.1. The simple ten-day moving average on Day 10 was 140.16. The closing price on
Day 11 was 130.52, a lower value than the mean value for the previous ten days. To calculate the
exponential moving average, we will use both the ten-day moving average (which represents the
mean exchange rate for Days 1–10) and the closing price for Day 11. Thus, we are now using 11
days of price information. If we were going to calculate an SMA using these 11 days of informa-
tion, each day’s exchange rate would have a weight of 1/11, or 9.09% in the calculation. Remem-
ber, however, that we want to place a larger weight on information that is more recent. If we want
the exchange rate information from Day 11 to have a weight twice as great as it would have in a
simple moving average, it would have a weight of 2/11, or 18.18%. Of course, the total of all the
weights in the calculation of the exponential moving average must sum to 100%. This leaves
100% minus 18.18%, or 81.82% weight to be placed on the ten-day moving average.

Chapter 14 Moving Averages 283
The general formula for determining the weight of the current day’s data in the exponential
moving average calculation is as follows:
WEIGHT = 2 ÷ (number of days in moving average + 1)
current
In our example, the calculation gives us WEIGHT = 2 ÷ (10 + 1) = 18.18 percent.
current
If we were using a longer moving average, this weight would decrease in value. For a 19-day
EMA, the calculation would be 2 ÷ (19 + 1) or 10%; a 39-day EMA would have a weight of 2 ÷
(39 + 1), or 5%.
The general formula for determining the weight given to the moving average in the calcu-
lation of the exponential moving average is the following:
WEIGHT = 100% – WEIGHT
ma current
In our example, we have WEIGHT = 100% – 18.18% = 81.82%.
ma
Once we have the weights, the formula for calculating the exponential moving average is
as follows:
EMA = WEIGHT ×DATA + WEIGHT ×Moving Average
day i current day i ma day i–1
ptg
The exponential moving average for Day 11 in our example in Table 14.1 is calculated as
the following:
EMA = .1818 ×130.52 + .8182 ×140.16 = 138.41
11
To calculate the exponential moving average for Day 12, we need only two pieces of infor-
mation—the exponential moving average for Day 11 and the closing price for Day 12. The
EMA would be calculated as follows:
12
EMA = .1818 ×131.61 + .8182 ×138.41 = 137.17
12
Figure 14.4 shows both a 26-day SMA and a 26-day EMA for CLB. Generally, the EMA
will change direction more quickly because of the additional weighting that is placed on the most
recent data. However, these two curves will usually track each other closely.
The EMA is used in a number of indicators and oscillators. In Chapter 8, “Measuring Mar-
ket Strength,” for example, we looked at the McClellan Index. The McClellan Index uses a 19-
day and a 39-day EMA. Because the 19-bar EMA has a smoothing factor of 0.10 and the 39-bar
EMA has a smoothing factor of 0.05, these calculations are relatively easy. We will see later that
a number of oscillators use an EMA, most prominently the MACD. The reason for the use of an
EMA is that it is easily calculated and that it weighs more strongly the prices that are more
recent. It is, thus, called a weighted moving average.

Wilder Method
Welles Wilder (1978) used another very simple method to calculate a moving average that
weights the most recent number more heavily. The formula for calculating Wilder’s moving aver-
age is as follows:
MA = ((n – 1) ×MA + Price ) ÷ n
day i i–1 dayi
For example, a 14-day Wilder moving average would be equal to the previous day’s mov-
ing average figure times 13 (i.e., n – 1, where n is the number of items to be averaged) plus the
current closing price, all divided by 14 (i.e., n).
Wilder’s method of calculating a moving average should be used in the Average True
Range (ATR), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Directional Movement Indicator (DMI)
calculations that he invented rather than the SMA or EMA. When using Wilder’s indicators that
are prepackaged in available trading and charting software, one must be sure that the calculations
for moving averages are Wilder’s. Some software programs use just an SMA or EMA and give
results inconsistent with Wilder’s methods.
Geometric Moving Average (GMA)
The geometric moving average is used mostly in indexes. It is a simple moving average of the
percent changes between the previous bar and the current bar over some past predetermined
period. Using percentages rather than points does not change its range or dimensions like a price-
based moving average. However, it still has all the other problems of equal weight and lag.

Chapter 14 Moving Averages 285
Triangular Moving Average
Taking a moving average of a moving average gives a doubly smoothed moving average. The tri-
angular moving average begins with a simple moving average of a predetermined number of bars
and then, using those results, takes a moving average of a length of half the original number of
bars. An example would be a 20-day SMA of daily closes smoothed in a ten-day SMA. The
result is a smoothed line that emphasizes the weight of the middle of the price series. The bene-
fit of this method is that it doubly smoothes the data and, thus, better represents the trend. How-
ever, the double smoothing also detracts from its sensitivity to trend changes.
Variable EMAs
The use of a variable moving average is suggested by Chande and Kroll (1994). This moving
average is the same as an exponential average (EMA), but the weighting scheme is adjusted
based on the volatility of the price data. This is done to make the EMA shorter during trading
ranges when volatility is narrow and expand the EMA when price begins to trend. The desire was
to reduce the number of adverse signals during a trading range.
There are a number of variations of this theme. For example, the Kaufman Adaptive Mov- ptg
ing Average (KAMA) involves an extremely complicated formula that adjusts an EMA for
volatility and trend (Kaufman, 1998). The Volume-Adjusted Moving Average (Arms, 1989) is a
somewhat complicated moving average, but its essence is that it emphasizes those bars with
higher volume. In the September 2001 issue of Stocks and Commodities Magazine, John Ehlers
presents MAMA and FAMA. MAMA, the MESA Adaptive Moving Average, and FAMA, the
Following Adaptive Moving Average, are EMAs that adapt to volatility using Hilbert’s Trans-
form based on the phase change of a cycle in the data. Needless to say, the calculation of these
moving averages is complicated. A buy or sell signal is generated when the MAMA crosses the
FAMA. In April 2004, Active Trader Magazine compared the effectiveness of using the MAMA-
FAMA strategy to using an SMA for 18 stocks and found that the MAMA-FAMA strategy per-
formed only slightly better than the simple method.
STRATEGIES FOR USING MOVING AVERAGES
We have looked at a number of ways to calculate moving averages. While each of these methods
has its advantages and disadvantages, our main concern is not how to calculate a moving average
but how to use moving averages to make money. Moving averages are widely used in the practice
of technical analysis. They are a basic tool with a broad set of uses. Technical analysts use mov-
ing averages to determine trend, to determine levels of support and resistance, to spot price
extremes, and for specific trading signals.
Determining Trend
Technical analysts use moving averages in four basic ways. First, moving averages are used as a
measure of trend. The most common usage is comparing the current price with the moving average

that represents the investor’s time horizon. For example, many investors use a 200-day moving
average. If the stock or market average is above its 200-day moving average, the trend is considered
upward. Conversely, if the stock or market average is below the 200-day moving average, the trend
is considered downward.
Figure 14.5 includes the same data with the moving average and the trend lines we used in
Chapter 12, “Trends—The Basics.” You can see how the moving average tends to follow the
trend line fairly well. The moving average then becomes a proxy for the trend line and can be
used to determine when a trend is potentially changing direction, just as can a trend line. In the
chart, for example, the later prices have held at both the trend line and the moving average.

Determining Support and Resistance
Second, the moving average often acts as support or resistance. As we have seen from Figure
14.5, a moving average often duplicates the trend line; therefore, it can be an easy trailing stop
mechanism for determining when a position should be liquidated or reduced. In addition, prices
seem to halt at the vicinity of moving averages. In Figure 14.5, for example, CLB halted its rally
in mid-May at the moving average and again halted its decline at the moving average in early
July.

Chapter 14 Moving Averages 287
Determining Price Extremes
Third, the moving average is an indicator of price extreme. Because the moving average is a
mean, any reversion to the mean will tend to approach the moving average. For trading purposes,
this reversion is sometimes profitable when the current price has deviated substantially from that
mean or moving average. Price has a tendency to return to the mean. Thus, a deviation from the
moving average is a measure of how much prices have risen or fallen ahead of their usual central
tendency, and being likely to return to that mean, this deviation then becomes an opportunity to
trade against the trend. As always, trading against the trend is dangerous and requires close stops,
but the reversion also provides an opportunity to position with the trend when it occurs. In addi-
tion, when prices continue substantially away from the trend, they are often signaling that the
trend is changing direction. An example is shown in Figure 14.6. This is a stock with a strong
longer-term upward trend, the dominant trend. The 26-day moving average measures the minor
trends within the dominant trend. When the price deviates from the 26-day SMA, it always even-
tually returns to that moving average. Thus, by measuring when the price is sufficiently distant
from the moving average, a trade can be initiated knowing that the price will return to that mean.
In the example, the minor trend turned downward in May from an overbought extreme. Because
the longer trend is upward, to have shorted at that overbought extreme would have been danger-
ptg
ous. However, in late May, an excellent opportunity to buy in line with the longer trend occurred
when the price deviated below the extreme oversold. When these opportunities are in sync with
the longer trend, they provide minimum risk and excellent profit potential.

288 Part III Trend Analysis
Giving Specific Signals
Fourth, some technical analysts use moving averages to give specific signals. These can occur
when prices cross a moving average, when a shorter moving average crosses a longer moving
average, and in some cases, when a third, even shorter, moving average crosses two longer ones.
Generally, using two moving averages and their crossover as a signal has been successful but
with substantial drawdowns in capital in sideways markets because of the many unprofitable
small trades that occur from the many false signals. Methods, such as using the ADX, described
in the next section, have been developed to determine if prices are trending at a rate at which a
moving-average crossover system will work. The MAMA-FAMA system described previously
and other methods of adapting moving averages to changes in volatility are aimed at solving this
drawdown problem. However, it will not go away, and thus, though the crossover methods are
profitable over time, the investor must have patience and enough capital to withstand a series of
small losses until a trend develops.
Of the four strategies, the most sensible use of moving averages is trend determination.
The trend is where the technical analyst profits. If the moving average can help in determining
the trend, it is a useful tool. Indeed, it is only during a trending market that moving average sig-
nals are profitable. A sideways market is costly in almost all cases, but especially so if the
ptg
investor depends on moving average crossovers for signals. Once a trend has been established
and identified, the next best method is to use price patterns and breakouts in the direction of the
trend for timing of position entries. This method will lag behind the major bottom and top of a
price trend but will accrue profits and minimize losses. It is also the most popular method in pro-
fessional trading systems, along with channel breakout systems such as Donchian’s four-week
rule that we discuss in the “Channel” section of this chapter.
WHAT IS DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT?
One of the great contributions to the concept of trend and direction is the concept of directional
movement that Welles Wilder (1978) developed in his book, New Concepts in Technical Trading
Systems. Wilder compared a stock’s trading range for one day with the trading range on the pre-
vious day to measure trend. Positive directional movement occurred when the high for a day
exceeded the high of the previous day. As shown in Figure 14.7, the amount of positive direc-
tional movement (+DM) is the day’s high minus the previous day’s high, or the vertical distance
between the top of the two bars. If the low for the day is less than the previous day’s low, nega-
tive directional movement occurs. The value of the negative directional movement (–DM) is the
difference between the two lows.
Days on which the range is completely within the previous day’s range are ignored, and a
zero is given to the range excess. In addition, one day’s trading range is sometimes much larger
than the previous day’s trading range. This can result in both a higher high and a lower low.
When this happens, the greater difference wins. In other words, only a +DM or –DM may be
recorded for a particular day.

Constructing Directional Movement Indicators
A moving average is calculated for both +DM and –DM, usually over 14 days, using the Wilder ptg
method of averaging. In addition, a 14-day average trading range (ATR) is calculated. Two indica-
tors are calculated using this data. The Positive Directional Movement Indicator (DMI+) is the ratio
between the smoothed +DM and the TR; this calculation gives the percentage of the true range that
was above equilibrium for those 14 days. The second indicator is the negative Directional Move-
ment Indicator (DMI–), which is calculated as the ratio between the smoothed –DM and the ATR.
Using Directional Movement Indicators
Figure 14.8 shows 14-day DMIs for Core Laboratories (CLB). Looking at this chart, an analyst
sees a number of hints about trend. First, when one DMI is higher than the other, the trend is in
the direction of that DMI. For example, from April through May, the DMI+ was above the DMI–,
indicating that a majority of the 14-day ATR excess for CLB was on the upside during that
period. When the first major crossover occurred in early May, and the DMI– crossed above the
DMI+, the trend had reversed downward. At that point, a longer-term trend line would not have
yet caught the switch in direction. At the point marked “1” on the chart, a downward crossover
signal occurred that warned of the upcoming severe price decline. Thus, the DMI crossover is an
important signal in analyzing trends.
Second, the minor crossover that occurred in March (marked with an “mc”) that lasted only
a day is also an important sign. It suggests that the direction of the trend is now sideways and, like
a congestion area, it may break in either direction. Often, the two DMIs come to equilibrium and
then part in their original direction, as happened here, in which case the earlier trend resumes. At
other times, the DMIs cross more dramatically and incisively, as they did in early May, and signal
a trend reversal. When the two meet, therefore, is an important period. Wilder suggested placing a
buy or sell stop at the price when the two first cross. In Figure 14.8, as the two DMIs cross in
March, we do not know if this is a trend reversal or not. Thus, we place a short-sell stop at a price
just below the price that occurred when the two initially crossed. If the trend is reversing, the price
will hit our stop, and our position will be in line with the new downward trend. If the stop is not
hit, the two lines will likely diverge again, and the old trend will continue without us.

Third, a DMI reaching an extreme level is often associated with a trend being at its maxi-
mum slope. When this occurs, the trend will invariably slow down and perhaps reverse. This is
the best time to exit a position. In Figure 14.8, for example, peaks in the two DMIs seem to occur
around 35. These levels are different for every stock or commodity and should be analyzed first.
When the DMI+ rose above 35 in late April, it signaled an extreme and the best time to sell a long
position. When the DMI– rose above 35 in late May, it was an extreme and the best time to cover
a short.
Fourth, the DMIs can be used to create a Directional Index (DX). This DX then is used to
create the average DX called the ADX line shown in Figure 14.8. The DX is calculated by tak-
ing the absolute difference between the values of the two DMIs and dividing it by the sum of the
two DMIs. The DX is always positive and represents the tendency of the market to trend because
it measures the DMIs against each other. When one DMI is very large compared with the other
DMI, the market is moving strongly in one direction and the value of the DX will be large.
The ADX is the smoothed value of the DX and is plotted on Figure 14.8. When the ADX is
rising, the market is increasingly trending in either direction.
The ADX indicator is valuable in determining when to apply a moving average trend-fol-
lowing system, for example. We know that the moving average systems have multiple whipsaws
when the market is not in a directional trend but have very profitable outcomes when the market
is trending in either an upward or downward direction. Many trend-following models use both of
these indicators to determine when money should be committed to the markets.
Fifth, when the ADX peaks above both the DMIs, it often signals a peak in the trend. In
Figure 14.8, even though the ADX never rises and peaks above both the DMIs, peaks (marked
with a P) do show periods when the trend has ended, such as in February, late April, and early
July.
Low levels in the ADX are also useful because they signify periods when the market has
become dormant and trendless. As we know from looking at congestion areas, a dormant period

is usually followed by a dynamic period. This phenomenon can be seen in Figure 14.8 with the
low ADX value associated with the sideways price movement at mid May, followed by a strong
upward price trend. Thus, a low ADX period is when the trader or investor should be watching
price closely for a breakout in either direction. ADXs and DMIs can be used on weekly, monthly,
and even shorter-term, intraday charts for clues as to trend strength and direction.
WHAT ARE ENVELOPES, CHANNELS, AND BANDS?
The simple moving average represents the center of a stock’s price trend. Actual prices tend to
oscillate around that moving average. The price movement is centered on the moving average but
falls within a band or envelope around the moving average. By determining the band within
which prices tend to oscillate, the analyst is better able to determine the range in which price may
be expected to fluctuate.
Percentage Envelopes
ptg
One way of creating this type of band is to use percentage envelopes. This method, also known
as a percentage filter, was developed in an attempt to reduce the numerous unprofitable signals
from crossing a moving average when the trend is sideways. This is a popular method used in
most of the academic studies on moving average crossover systems. It is calculated by taking a
percentage of the moving average and plotting it above and below the moving average (see Fig-
ure 14.9)—thus the term “envelope.” This plot creates two symmetrical lines, one above and one
below the moving average.

==================================================

292 Part III Trend Analysis
This envelope then becomes the trigger for signals when it is crossed by the price rather than
when the moving average is crossed. The percentage used in the calculation should be large
enough that it encompasses most of the oscillations around the moving average during a side-
ways period and, thus, reduces the number of incorrect signals, yet small enough to give signals
early enough to be profitable once a trend has been established. This percentage must be deter-
mined through experiment because a slight difference in percentage can cause a considerable dif-
ference in performance.
One of the major problems with fixed-percentage envelopes is that they do not account for
the changing volatility of the underlying price. During a sideways trend, when volatility usually
declines, price action can be contained within a relatively narrow band. When the trend begins,
however, volatility often expands and will then create false signals using a fixed-percentage
envelope. To combat this problem, the concept of bands that are adjusted for volatility developed.
Bands
Bands are also envelopes around a moving average but, rather than being fixed in size, are calcu-
lated to adjust for the price volatility around the moving average. They, thus, shrink when prices
become calm and expand when prices become volatile. The most widely used band is the ptg
Bollinger Band, named after John Bollinger (2002).
Bollinger Band
As we mentioned earlier, there are two principal ways to measure price volatility. One is the stan-
dard deviation about a mean or moving average, and the other is the ATR. Bollinger Bands use
the standard deviation calculation.
To construct Bollinger Bands, first calculate a simple moving average of prices. Bollinger
uses the SMA because most calculations using standard deviation use an SMA. Next, draw
bands a certain number of standard deviations above and below the moving average. For exam-
ple, Bollinger’s standard calculation, and the one most often seen in the public chart services,
begins with a 20-period simple moving average. Two standard deviations are added to the SMA
to plot an upper band. The lower band is constructed by subtracting two standard deviations from
the SMA. The bands are self-adjusting, automatically becoming wider during periods of extreme
price changes.
Figure 14.10 shows the standard Bollinger Band around the 20-period moving average. Of
course, both the length of the moving average and the number of standard deviations can be
adjusted. Theoretically, the plus or minus two standard deviations should account for approxi-
mately 95% of all the price action about the moving average. In fact, this is not quite true because
price action is nonstationary and nonrandom and, thus, does not follow the statistical properties
of the standard deviation calculation precisely. However, it is a good estimate of the majority of
price action. Indeed, as the chart shows, the price action seems to oscillate between the bands
quite regularly. This action is similar to the action in a congestion area or rectangle pattern (see
Chapter 15, “Bar Chart Patterns”), except that prices also tend to oscillate within the band as the
price trends upward and downward. This is because the moving average is replicating the trend
of the prices and adjusting for them while the band is describing their normal upper and lower
limits around the trend as price volatility changes.

Keltner Band
Chester Keltner (1969) introduced Keltner Bands in his book, How to Make Money in Commodi-
ties. To construct these bands, first calculate the “Typical Price” (Close + High + Low) ÷ 3, and
calculate a ten-day SMA of the typical price. Next, calculate the band size by creating a ten-day
SMA of High minus Low or bar range. The upper band is then plotted as the ten-day SMA of the
typical price plus the ten-day SMA of bar range. The lower band is plotted as the ten-day SMA
to the typical price minus the ten-day SMA of bar range. (When the calculation is rearranged, it
is very similar to the use of an ATR, and these bands are sometimes referred to as ATR bands.)
As with most methods, different analysts prefer to modify the basic model to meet their
specific needs and investment strategies. Although Keltner’s original calculation used ten-day
moving averages, many analysts using this method have extended the moving averages to 20
periods. The 20-period calculation is more in line with the calculation for a Bollinger Band.
STARC Band
STARC is an acronym for Stoller Average Range Channel, invented by Manning Stoller. This
system uses the ATR over five periods added to and subtracted from a five-period SMA of prices.
It produces a band about prices that widens and shrinks with changes in the ATR or the volatility
of the price. Just as with the Keltner Bands, the length of the SMA used with STARC can be
adjusted to different trading or investing time horizons.

Trading Strategies Using Bands and Envelopes
In line with the basic concept of following the trend, bands and envelopes are used to signal
when a trend change has occurred and to reduce the number of whipsaws that occur within a
tight trading range. While looking at the envelopes or bands on a chart, one would think that the
best use of them might be to trade within them from high extreme to low extreme and back, sim-
ilar to strategies for rectangle patterns. However, the trading between bands is difficult. First, by
definition, except for fixed envelopes, the bands contract during a sideways, dull trend and leave
little room for maneuvering at a cost-effective manner and with profitable results. Second, when
prices suddenly move on a new trend, they will tend to remain close to the band in the direction
of the trend and give many false exit signals. Third, when the bands expand, they show that
volatility has increased, usually due to the beginning of a new trend, and any position entered in
further anticipation of low volatility is quickly stopped out.
Bands, therefore, have become methods of determining the beginnings of trends and are
not generally used for range trading between them. When the outer edge of a band is broken,
empirical evidence suggests that the entry should be in the direction of the breakout, not unlike
the breakout of a trend line or support or resistance level. A breakout from a band that contains
roughly 90% of previous price action suggests that the general trend of the previous price action
ptg
has changed in the direction of the breakout.
In Figure 14.10, a breakout buy signal occurs in April, when the price breaks above the
upper Bollinger Band, hinting that a strong upward trend is starting. You will notice that the
bands had become narrower during March. This band tightening, caused by shrinking volatility,
is often followed by a sharp price move.
The only difference between a band breakout and a more conventional kind is that a band
is generally more fluid. Because moving averages will often become support or resistance levels,
the moving average in the Bollinger Band calculation should then become the trailing stop level
for any entry that previously occurred from a breakout above or below the band. The ability of
moving averages to be used as trailing stops is easily spliced into a system utilizing any kind of
bands that adjust for volatility.
The other use for the moving average within a band is that because the moving average
often becomes either support or resistance, it can become a retracement level for additional entry
in the trend established by the direction of the moving average and the bands. With a stop only
slightly below the moving average using the rules we learned in the last chapter for establishing
stop levels, when the price retraces back into the area of the moving average while in a strong
upward trend, an additional entry can be made where the retracement within the band is expected
to halt.
In testing band breakouts, the longer the bar, it seems, the more profitable the system. Very
short-term volatility, because it is proportionally more active, causes many false breakouts.
Longer-term periods with less volatility per period appear to remain in trends for longer periods
and are not whipsawed as much as short-term trends. The most profitable trend-following sys-
tems are long-term, and as short-term traders have learned, the ability of price to oscillate sharply

Chapter 14 Moving Averages 295
is greater than when it is smoothed over longer periods. Thus, the inherent whipsaws in short-
term data become reduced over longer periods, and trend-following systems tracking longer
trends have fewer unprofitable signals. Bands are more successful in trending markets and are,
therefore, more suitable for commodities markets than the stock market.
Another use for bands is to watch price volatility. Low volatility is generally associated
with sideways to slightly slanted trends, ones where whipsaws are common and patterns fail.
High volatility is generally associated with a strong trend, up or down. By watching volatility,
especially for an increase in volatility, the analyst has a clue that a change in trend is forthcom-
ing. To watch volatility, one should take a difference between the high band and low band and
plot it as a line below the price action. Bollinger calls this line a Bandwidth Indicator. A rise in
the bandwidth line, which results from increasing volatility, can be associated directly with price
action. Any breakout from a pattern, support or resistance level, trend line, or moving average
can be confirmed by the change in volatility. If volatility does not increase with a price breakout,
the odds favor that the breakout is false. Volatility, therefore, can be used as confirmation for
trend changes, or it can be used as a warning that things are about to change. This use of bands is
more successful when combined with other methods of determining an actual trend change.
ptg
Channel
In discussing trend lines, we noted that a line can often be drawn parallel to a trend line that
encompasses the price action in what was called a channel. For present purposes, that definition
changes slightly by relaxing the requirement for a parallel line.
Channels have become described as something simpler than two parallel lines. For exam-
ple, in Chapter 12, we mentioned the Donchian channel method that has been so successful even
though it’s been widely known for many years. Signals occur with the Donchian channel when
the breaking above or below a high or low over some past period occurs (see Figure 14.11). This
method does not require the construction of a trend line; the only requirement is a record of the
highs and lows over some past period. In the case of the Donchian channel method, the period
was four weeks, and the rule was to buy when the price exceeded the highest level over the past
four weeks and sell when the price declined below the lowest low over the past four weeks. Such
systems are usually “stop and reverse” systems that are always in the market, either long or short.
As is likely imagined, the channel systems are more commonly used in the commodities markets
where long and short positions are effortless and prices tend to trend much longer.
An adaptation of the standard channel breakout system is to use different periods for buy
and sell signals. For example, a 200-day period of highs might be used for a buy signal, and a 20-
day period might be used for a sell signal. Generally, this method works well in commodity mar-
kets where trending is stronger and longer lasting. It does not work as well in the stock market.

CONCLUSION
The basic way the technical analyst makes profits is by identifying a trend in prices and riding
that trend. At times, daily fluctuations in prices make it difficult for the analyst to view the basic
underlying trend in prices. Moving averages are tools used to smooth this erratic data, making it
easier to discern the genuine underlying trend.
Although there are various methods of calculating a moving average, the basic idea is to
give a summary of the average or normal price history of a particular period. Because the mov-
ing averages are based on historical prices, by nature, they will be a lagging indicator of trends.
The shorter the period covered by the moving average, the less of a lag there will be. However,
using a shorter period also leads to more false signals. As usual, when choosing a moving aver-
age system, there is a trade-off between early trend reversal recognition and certainty of trend
reversal. The use of envelopes, bands, and channels around the moving average can minimize the
number of false signals by providing a larger range of price movement before a signal is trig-
gered.
Box 14.1 gives a list of basic principles that the technical analyst should keep in mind. This
list provides a summary of some of the key points we have addressed in the past three chapters.

BOX 14.1 TRADING RULES
In the past few chapters, we have covered a good deal of material regarding trends.
Here are some of the key points to remember when investing:
• Riding the trend is the most profitable use of technical analysis.
• Trends can be identified with trend lines, moving averages, and relative highs
and lows.
• Always pick a security that trends up and down. Flat or random trends are
usually unprofitable.
• Be aware of the next longer period and shorter period trends from the one
being traded.
• Always trade with the trend:
• “Trend is your friend.”
• “Don’t buck the trend.”
• Breakouts from support or resistance levels, patterns, or bands usually signal
ptg
a change in trend.
• A trend line breakout is at least a warning.
• The longer the trend, the more important the breakout.
• Confirm any breakout with other evidence, especially when entering a posi-
tion. In exiting, confirmation is not as important.
• Always use stops, protective and trailing.
• Do not sell profitable positions too soon; just keep trailing with stops.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with
• Controversy over whether patterns exist ptg
• The influence that computer technology has had on the study of patterns
• The formation of classic bar chart patterns such as triangles, flags, pennants, double
tops, and head-and-shoulders
• Historical performance measures of major bar chart patterns
In the next three chapters, we discuss chart and price patterns. Traditionally, technical analysis
has been closely associated with price patterns, perhaps even more than it should be. Prior to the
advent of the computer, hand-drawn charts of prices were the only technical resources available.
Trend lines and patterns were the principal means of analyzing price behavior. The computer has
diversified technical analysis because it has made other mathematical relationships easier to cal-
culate.
After discussing some of the basic characteristics of patterns, we look at classic bar chart
patterns, those used by the majority of technical analysts and having the longest history of use, in
this chapter. In Chapter 16, “Point-and-Figure Chart Patterns,” we focus on point-and-figure
charts. In Chapter 17, “Short-Term Patterns,” we consider short-term patterns, candlesticks, one-
and two-day patterns, and other patterns that are not so widely used. There are as many different
patterns as the combinations of price open, high, low, and close can accommodate. Generally,
shorter patterns are more common and less reliable, and longer patterns are more complex and
less frequent. In addition, as a rule, the more complicated the pattern, the less likely it will be
profitable, and the more frequent a pattern, the less likely it will be profitable. The best patterns
seem to be in the middle of frequency and complexity. We address these. There are many refer-
ence books on other patterns that you can investigate, but most fail to give any special advantage
over the classic patterns.

302 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
WHAT ISA PATTERN?
In the literature and usage of technical analysis, the terms pattern and formation are used inter-
changeably. We will do the same. A pattern is simply a configuration of price action that is
bounded, above and below, by some form of either a line or a curve.
The lines that bind price movement in a pattern can be trend lines or support/resistance
lines. In this chapter, we apply the concepts and terminology that we studied in Chapter 12,
“Trends—The Basics,” regarding these lines. When studying patterns, we add a new concept—
prices being bound by a curve instead of a straight line. A curve is a less-definite arc drawn with
either a “smiley face” for a bottom curve or a “frown” for the top curve. The lowest level in a bot-
tom curve is a support level, and the highest level in a top curve is a resistance level. Curves sim-
ply define a support or resistance level with curved rather than straight lines. A pattern can be
bounded by any combination of curves or lines as long as the upper and lower bounds are defined
well enough for a breakout level to be established.
Common Pattern Characteristics
The focus of this chapter is bar chart price configurations. Thomas N. Bulkowski has accom-
ptg
plished the most comprehensive modern study of bar chart patterns in his twin books, Encyclo-
pedia of Chart Patterns, 2nd edition (2005) and Trading Classic Chart Patterns (2002).
Bulkowski observed over 700 stocks over ten years on a daily basis and cataloged their results
under varying conditions. In total, over two market periods he found and analyzed 12,385 chart
patterns. Although his analysis of patterns was, of course, subject to his potential bias, it was
consistent and included a significantly large number of examples. Much of the material—specif-
ically the statistics—in this chapter rely on Bulkowski’s work. Bulkowski has a Web site
(www.thepatternsite.com) that explains in significant detail all the patterns we discuss and more.
Before we begin discussing some of the particular patterns, however, we need to explain some
vocabulary related to the general characteristics of bar chart patterns.
Entry and Exit
All patterns have a combination of an entry and exit. The entry describes the trend preceding the
formation, and the exit is usually the signal for action. A pattern can occur after a decline, in
which case, the entry is from above, or after an advance, in which case, the entry is from below.
The exit, of course, can also be downward or upward. Figure 15.1, a double bottom, shows an
entry from above and an upward breakout. On the other hand, a top formation has an entry from
below and an exit downward. A consolidation in a larger uptrend has an entry from below and an
exit upward. Thus, all patterns are described with these four variables: entry from above, entry
from below, downward exit, and upward exit. These variables are important because statistically,
in each pattern type, some of these characteristics are more reliable, occur more frequently, or
are more profitable than others.

Chapter 15 Bar Chart Patterns 303
Fractal
The bars in a bar chart can be any period: weekly, daily, minute, and so on. Bar chart patterns are
fractal. This means they can occur in any bar chart, regardless of the bar period. A triangle for-
mation, for example, can occur in hourly bars or weekly bars. The pattern is always the same
type and will always have the same general characteristics. This is odd but true. Indeed, looking
at a bar chart pattern without a specified time horizon, a technical analyst who is experienced in
pattern recognition cannot tell the periods of the bars.
Pullbacks and Throwbacks
Pullbacks occur when prices break out downward and then “pull back” to their breakout level.
Throwbacks occur when prices break out upward and then “throw back” to their breakout level
(Edwards and Magee, revised 2007). Figure 15.1 shows an example of a pullback. Neither a pull-
back nor a throwback is easily or precisely defined, but you know one when you see it. The inter-
esting aspect of this price behavior is that invariably a pullback or throwback will decrease the
extent of the eventual move in the direction of the breakout. Thus, although each may provide a
second opportunity for action at the breakout level, the subsequent rise or fall generally will be
less than if there were no pullback or throwback. Tactically, this implies that a breakout should
be acted upon immediately; waiting for the retracement will diminish profitability, and you may
very likely miss the entire price move. ptg
Pullbacks seem to occur more frequently on downward breakouts with less-than-average
volume, and throwbacks occur more frequently with upward breakouts on above-average vol-
ume. Because pullbacks and throwbacks seem to undermine performance, the ideal situation, as
a rule, is that on an upward breakout, less volume is preferred, and on a downward breakout,
more volume is preferred.
Failures
All breakouts can fail in any of the formations, some more than others. Remember that a break-
out is a signal that prices are beginning to trend, either upward or downward. This is particularly
frustrating to the beginner who desires perfection. As we have seen, however, perfection is not in
the lexicon of technical analysis. It is favorable odds, or an “edge,” for which we are looking.
Bulkowski’s definition of a failure, which we use, is when a breakout occurs and the price fails to
move at least 5% in the direction of the breakout.
DO PATTERNS EXIST?
Some academics and investors believe that patterns do not exist. They believe either that price
action is completely random or, at least, is indecipherable. We saw in Chapter 4, “The Technical
Analysis Controversy,” that the concept of randomness is now being questioned, leaving open
the possibility that order does exist in prices. However, even if order does exist in market prices,
it is possible that it cannot be recognized with present mathematical models because it is so com-
plex. The methods used in chaos theory, neural networks, and other esoteric mathematical mod-
els may prove useful sometime in the future, but not now. Thus, there is still the realistic question

304 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
of whether patterns do exist in prices. Technical analysts swear they do but in many cases ana-
lysts are not mathematically sophisticated enough to demonstrate their validity.
As mentioned in Chapter 11, “History and Construction of Charts,” the unpublished article
by Hasanhodzic et al. (2010) on a study of online video game players (http://arora.ccs.neu.edu)
attempting to distinguish between financial market price statistics in moving chart form from
random permutations of the same data with immediate feedback found that these people could
“consistently distinguish between the two types of time series”(p. 1). This experiment seemed to
give evidence that humans can learn to distinguish patterns and real data from random series
whereas computers, so far, cannot.
If prices do have patterns, what causes them? This has been a debate for at least a century
and has coalesced into a belief that patterns are the result of human behavior, which, conve-
niently, is indecipherable. It is, however, why technical analysts are very much interested in the
new behavioral finance studies. They hope that the biases and tendencies in human behavior now
being measured and gradually understood by behavioral finance students will eventually explain
why price patterns seem to exist.
Behavioral Finance and Pattern Recognition
The first fact to acknowledge about chart patterns is that they have not been proven to exist or to ptg
be profitable. Although many investors and traders swear by certain formations, their evidence is
largely anecdotal. Added to this is the tendency to see patterns in random data.
Humans have a tendency to want patterns in data and other information and to see them
when they do not exist. Superstitions are derived from the erroneous and coincidental observa-
tions of patterns that do not exist but are created because of the desire to have a pattern. B. F.
Skinner, a famous Harvard psychology professor, studied pigeon behavior in a number of stimu-
lus-response situations to see if the pigeons would react to various stimuli and thus “learn”
responses. The reward for the correct response was usually food. In one experiment, he decided
to give pigeons just food without a stimulus to see what they would do. Invariably, in trying to
make sense out of stimulus-response, the pigeons responded in different manners by creating
their own stimulus, some bobbing, some developing strange head motions, thus creating their
own superstition, when a real stimulus did not exist (Skinner, 1947).
Humans are very similar in their desire to have some kind of stimulus, even if it is a black
cat crossing the road, and develop supposedly predictive relationships when none actually exists.
This is a special danger in price analysis because the desire to see a pattern can occur when no
pattern actually exists.
Humans are also very poor statisticians and tend to put more weight on recent history than
what is statistically warranted. An experiment by Kahneman and Tversky (1982) showed that in
flipping coins, which have a statistical probability of landing on their heads 50% of the time
regardless of what side they landed on earlier, observers began to expect more heads in the future
when the sequence of heads turned up more frequently, and they were surprised when that did
not occur. Their subconscious brains expected more heads because that was the most recent his-
tory of flips, even though the odds had not changed. In the technical analysis of patterns, the ana-
lyst must guard against superstition or what is often called “market lore.” Frequently these

Chapter 15 Bar Chart Patterns 305
statements contradict other statements or are just plain wrong. An example is that “a descending
triangle always breaks downward.” You will see how this is not born out by fact when we discuss
triangles. Pattern and trend analysis must be based on evidence alone.
Humans also tend to see the future as the past and look backward rather than forward. This
bias is very likely the reason that trends in prices exist in the first place and why prices rise or fall
until they reach some exhaustion limit rather than adjusting immediately as the EMH would sug-
gest. For this reason, humans have difficulty in recognizing when past signs or patterns are no
longer valid. Studies have shown that the human brain releases dopamine (a pleasure sensation
chemical and, thus, a reward) when a human takes action that has worked before. Thus, the
pleasurable action is desirable and overcomes any cognitive reasoning that might suspect the
action is wrong. This problem is especially prevalent and potentially very dangerous in the finan-
cial markets where change is constant.
“In a world without change, the best way to find cheese is to return to the location where it
was found previously. In a world with change, however, the best way to find cheese is to look
somewhere new” Burnham (2005, p. 284), paraphrasing from Johnson (1998). In other words,
the chart pattern and trend reader should look for failure rather than believe in the constancy of
previous patterns. Schwager (1996) suggests that profitability from failed patterns is often
greater than from correct patterns.
ptg
COMPUTERS AND PATTERN RECOGNITION
Analysts began recognizing chart patterns in the days when prices were plotted daily by hand.
Aside from trend lines, patterns were the beginning of technical analysis, and for this reason,
many nontechnicians mistakenly believe that patterns are all that technicians study. Floor traders
and market makers still plot intraday charts of prices for their use in trading short periods, but the
computer has changed technical analysis considerably. On a computer screen, charts of minute-
to-minute, even tick-to-tick prices can now be displayed, and from them, various patterns can be
recognized. This has led to impersonal contact with prices, different from the days when each bar
was plotted individually and the “feel” for price action was more easily learned. In addition, the
time horizon for traders off the floor has become shorter. The ability to see almost instantly a
change in price behavior combined with lower commission costs and less slippage, all due to the
introduction of computers, has led traders to speculate on shorter-term trends and patterns.
The computer did not make the study of patterns any easier, however. Patterns change and
adjust to new markets. Some of the old patterns do not seem to work very well anymore, and oth-
ers have taken their place. Patterns are also subjectively determined, and in many cases they are
perhaps invalid. Tests are being made currently on their validity, a difficult enterprise because
patterns are more visually based than mathematically based. They are peculiar to humans in that
like recognizing a friend’s face out of a collage of faces, a particular chart pattern must be recog-
nized out of a series of patterns in prices. Like quantifying your friend’s face, quantifying a chart
pattern is not easily accomplished. Only through practice, many mistakes, and many correct
interpretations that go wrong is the technical analyst consistently able to recognize patterns. This

is how the art of technical analysis developed before the computer, and although the computer is
now taking over both in plotting and in analyzing, the chart patterns still exist and are used by
many practitioners. Recent authors of books on technical chart methods will attest to the
longevity of certain patterns and their fractal nature. The analysis of price patterns remains,
though less emphasis is placed on it.
The analyst using a computer is able to compute more quickly various ratios, averages,
spreads, and so on. Computer usage also has the advantage of giving the technician the ability to
test these new calculations as well as the old ones for accuracy and statistical significance. The
old-time technical analyst had to rely on many years of experience to determine the reliability of
formations and indicators and often, for example, stayed up late at night with a hand-crank
adding machine calculating indicators and oscillators. As we know from studies of behavior,
anecdotal experience can be deceiving, but with the advent of the computer, we can now objec-
tively study many oscillators, averages, and other methods that before were impractical to study.
The computer has “cleaned” up a lot of the folklore about patterns and trends and eliminated
those that have little or no validity. It has made technical analysis more of a science than an art.
Remarkably, though understandable from the previous discussion of human behavior, many of
these old inaccurate methods are still used.
ptg
MARKET STRUCTURE AND PATTERN RECOGNITION
The markets, of course, have also changed since the beginning of technical analysis and the first
recognition of patterns, and with this change, patterns have changed and become less accurate.
First, the proliferation of technical knowledge has led to the recognition of specific patterns
when they occur. Of course, once a pattern is widely recognized and acted upon, its effectiveness
diminishes. Thus, patterns in widely traded securities tend to be less accurate than in those quiet
trading securities that very few traders watch.
In the stock market, ownership has become concentrated in relatively few hands that tend
to act in concert. These “hands” are the institutional holders of securities. They tend to act
together when news is announced; thus, by their large positions and anxiousness to get in or get
out, they cause patterns to self-destruct. Although it is difficult to prove, when a large institution
is the dominant owner of a stock and has knowledge of technical principles, there is a temptation
to “manipulate” a chart formation and cause false breakouts. This can cause havoc with the short-
term trader who is watching the same patterns develop.
Finally, the advent of derivatives in large quantities has influenced the price and volume
action in individual securities for reasons other than the prospects for the underlying company.
Addition or deletion from a market index or basket can suddenly introduce buying or selling
unrelated to the pattern developing.

BAR CHARTS AND PATTERNS
From Chapter 11, you know how to plot a bar chart. It is the most common chart of price behav-
ior and has been used ever since continuous trading data became available. In Chapter 12, you
learned how to determine support and resistance zones and trend lines using bar charts. Bar chart
patterns form by combining support and resistance zones and trend lines. In all cases, a pattern
finalizes when a breakout occurs from the pattern. In some instances, a pattern will just dribble
into inactivity, in which case it should be ignored, but most patterns result in a legitimate break-
out in one direction or the other. The breakout may be false, of course, and we look at how to

handle that occurrence. We have observed the peculiarities of drawing trend lines and establish-
ing support and resistance zones in previous chapters, and from the previous discussion, the dif-
ficulties in recognizing patterns from imperfect data. Patterns are, thus, never exactly the same
from example to example and are fit into generic categories with common characteristics based
principally on the direction of internal trends and their intersections.
Traditionally, we divide patterns into two categories: continuation and reversal. This is a
holdover from Schabacker (1930), and used by Edwards and Magee (revised, 2007), who needed
to break patterns into easily understood and recognizable divisions. Unfortunately, as Edwards
and Magee recognized, patterns cannot always easily be relegated to a specific reversal or contin-
uation category, and such a description can often be misleading. Instead, patterns can occur in
both modes. For this reason, we prefer to abandon the standard method of differentiating patterns
into “continuation” and “reversal,” and although we still use the terms when appropriate, we
instead describe the simplest patterns first and progress to the more complex.
HOW PROFITABLE ARE PATTERNS?
Studies of chart performance and reliability are scarce. The problem, of course, is the difficulty
ptg
in defining a chart pattern on a computer. In 1970, one of the authors of this book and Robert
Levy (1971) devised a method to identify patterns by recording the sequence of reversal points
relative to their immediate past reversal points. This sounds complex, perhaps, but using only
five reversal points, almost all simple chart patterns can be identified and their results recorded.
Arthur Merrill (1997) took this study method and with some variation tested it on the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. In both studies, the results showed that chart patterns as defined had little pre-
dictive ability. Several patterns showed some statistical reliability, but not enough to prove the
case for technical price patterns in general.
In a 1988 study by Lo and MacKinlay, more sophisticated statistical methods were used to
see if patterns existed in individual prices. The study had mixed results. Although it did not
negate the possibility of patterns, neither did it prove that patterns existed.
The most comprehensive study to date is that of Bulkowski (2005). Many of the statistics
mentioned in each pattern section later in the chapter are taken from his more recent work on
trading classic patterns (2002). The intriguing nature of Bulkowski’s studies is that many of the
old observations seen in the classic literature are turning out to be questionable, especially for
maximum performance. As examples, volume trend within a pattern, slope of trends, and break-
out volume may not be as relevant as others had originally thought.
Remember also that Bulkowski’s observations are in retrospect. We can easily identify
many chart patterns after they have occurred, and when we have observed the results. The real
talent comes in identifying a chart pattern while it is evolving in real time and profiting from its
completion. For this ability, only study, practice, and experience will suffice.
Finally, the results from Bulkowski’s observations are relative only. They cannot be
assumed to be profitable in the future, as they appeared to be during the trial period. The value of
his study is not in determining the value of chart pattern analysis itself but in determining which
of the classic patterns are more profitable with less risk. From Bulkowski’s studies, it appears

that pattern analysis outperforms the market (S&P 500) on average in every instance. This might
or might not be true, but for our purposes, we are more interested in which patterns to study as
being the most likely to profit over others.
BOX 15.2 USING BREAKOUT PRICE TO SET PRICE TARGETS
Bar charts can project price targets once a formation completes with the breakout.
Most targets are measured from the breakout price. Targets are infrequently used
because most technicians are satisfied with just being on the right side of the trend,
want only to ride that trend, and believe that targets are generally inaccurate. In many
patterns, however, this is not so. Generally, the target is calculated by taking the
height of the pattern and adding it to the breakout price. In each of the following
trading boxes, we describe the target peculiarities for each pattern and the success
percentages.
ptg
CLASSIC BAR CHART PATTERNS
We begin by looking at classic chart patterns. These patterns generally have been recognized and
used for over a hundred years. Only recently have there been tests of their reliability and prof-
itability.
Double Top and Double Bottom
A double formation is about the simplest of the classic formations. A double top consists of only
three reversal points: two peaks separated by a trough (see Figure 15.1). For it to be a true dou-
ble top, the initial price must enter the pattern from below the trough price, and the exit signal
must occur on the breakout below the trough low price. The two peaks must be at or within 5%
of each other’s price level, and the middle valley should be around 10% from the highest peak.
The double top, thus, resembles the rectangle formation (described next) with less detail. The
pattern forms over 2 to 7 weeks: the longer, the less reliable. The best-performing tops are with
rounded peaks. These are called “Eve and Eve” double top patterns. The double bottom is the
mirror image of the double top.
Newspaper and media commentators who want to sound like technical analysts frequently
use the term double formation often when it is not a true double pattern. A true formation is only
valid when the intervening reaction reversal point has been penetrated. The danger of acting pre-
maturely is great; roughly 64% of these patterns fail to penetrate the breakout level and instead
continue on their original trend. When the pattern is completed with a breakout, however, it is
very accurate.

The failure rates are 11%. This means that the odds of making a profit from a double top
downward breakout are minimally risky. Bulkowski ranks the overall performance rank at 2 out
of 21, a very high ranking. This ranking is a composition of the pattern’s failure rate, average
profit, pullback/throwback rate, and percent of trades reaching a price target.
BOX 15.3 TRADING DOUBLE FORMATIONS
If one observes a double pattern, several important observations must be made before
acting to improve the chances of profit. First, never buy until the breakout has
occurred. Second, look for flat bases either at the same level as the twin bottoms or
slightly higher and earlier. Third, look for an absence of a consolidation area above
the formation. Fourth, look for what is called an “Eve & Eve” variety. Volume doesn’t
seem to be important, though it is usually higher on the first “hump.”
Rectangle (Also “Trading Range” or “Box”)
In the earlier discussion on trading ranges and sideways trends, we effectively described a rectan-
gle pattern. It is one of the simplest of patterns, consisting of a resistance line above and a sup-
port line below (see Figure 15.2). Each resistance or support line must also be a trend line, which
means that it must touch roughly the same price reversal at least twice. This added requirement
is what separates it from a double top or bottom formation, which only requires that three price
reversals occur. Prices are bounded by and oscillate between the two lines, and eventually exit, or

break out, in one direction or the other. The pattern can have a slight tilt upward or downward,
but the trend lines defining the support and resistance zones are always parallel. It appears simi-
lar to a horizontal channel. It often has false or premature breakouts, neither of which is predic-
tive of the eventual breakout direction.

BOX 15.4 FALSE AND PREMATURE BREAKOUTS
These breakouts are not exits from a formation but instead are minor breakouts
above or below breakout levels that quickly return into the formation. They can
occur at support and resistance levels as well as at trend lines. A “false” breakout is
one that breaks out in the direction opposite from the direction of the final breakout,
and a “premature” breakout is one that breaks in the same direction as the eventual
exit breakout. In retrospect, these breakouts can have predictive value, but at the time
either occurs, it is almost impossible to tell what type it is. When they occur fre-
quently, they warn that a very strict breakout discipline must be used to avoid trig-
gering action before the actual exit breakout.
Within the rectangle formation, prices do not necessarily always reach the two zones but
may fall short (a “shortfall” or “partial”). Sometimes this is a warning as to the direction of the
eventual breakout. As an example, when well along the way of the formation of a rectangle,
prices begin to reverse before declining all the way to the underlying support zone; buyers are
getting a little more anxious and the odds increase for a breakout upward. Bulkowski reported
that such a shortfall within the latter stages of the pattern is accurate 60% to 90% of the time in

predicting the direction of eventual breakout depending on the breakout direction. More than half
the time, prices throw back or pull back to the breakout zone, providing another action point but
one with less profit potential. Edwards and Magee estimated that about 40% of the time, a pull-
back or throwback would occur. When the breakout occurs on a gap, the odds decrease that a
retracement will occur.
Volume is often an important factor in any formation. In the rectangle pattern, however, a
rising or declining volume trend within the pattern has little or no effect on the results after the
breakout, though declining volume is more common. Results increase, however, when volume
increases on the breakout itself.
Depending on the rectangle entry and exit (i.e., whether it is a reversal or continuation pat-
tern), the failure to reach 5% was between 9% and 16%. The worst was the declining continua-
tion pattern (entry from above, exit down). Bulkowski ranked the overall performance of
rectangles in the middle of the classical pattern pack.
BOX 15.5 TRADING RECTANGLES
Edwards and Magee claimed that rectangles are more often continuation patterns,
but as a reversal pattern, they occur more frequently at bottoms. This is likely why ptg
Bulkowski mostly found upward breakout rectangle patterns. An upward breakout,
however, should never be assumed. Indeed, two out of three rectangles are continua-
tion patterns, and the initial expected direction of the breakout should be in line with
the previous trend.
Rectangles have the bad habit of producing false breakouts. Indeed, over 75% of
early breakouts are false. This is a large enough figure to hint as to the eventual final
breakout direction, but it requires very close breakout and stop discipline. Once the
final breakout has occurred, the failure rate is very low. Thus, it pays to be sure that
the breakout is real. Another hint is the existence of shortfalls. Shortfalls occur later in
the formation and can anticipate the breakout. Use a method similar to that shown in
Chapter 13, “Breakouts, Stops, and Retracements,” on anticipating breakouts, and
keep a close protective stop. The volume trend during the formation of the pattern
gives no hint as to the breakout direction and has only a minor effect on performance.
Some traders will trade within a rectangle, buying at the support level and selling
at the resistance level. This is not recommended, however, unless the rectangle is
particularly wide from top to bottom. Trading has many costs inherent in acting on
the buys and sells. The obvious costs are commissions, slippage, and width of the
spread. Additionally, when trading within two bounds, the bounds are not exact nor
will a trade be executed exactly at the bound. Thus, sell orders must be placed a cer-
tain distance, a specified filter, below a resistance zone, and buy orders a certain dis-
tance above a support zone. To be able to absorb these costs and price filters, the
trader is limited to rectangles that are sufficiently high, from support to resistance.
One who attempts this kind of trading must be watching the price action incessantly
and be ready to scalp the few points in between the bounds and filters in an instant.
Most traders and investors are unable to do this.

A target can be calculated by adding the height of the rectangle formation to the
breakout price. According to Bulkowski, in rectangles, the upward target is reached
or exceeded 91%–93% of the time, and in downward breakouts, the target is reached
or exceeded 65%–77% of the time. The difference in percentages is based on the
entry, whether upward or downward, but in all cases, the target is a relatively accu-
rate figure and can be used for risk/reward calculations.
Triple Top and Triple Bottom
The triple top and bottom formation is just a rectangle with the number of touches to the support
or resistance line being three. It is, thus, more specific than the rectangle and is less common.
Each peak in the top should be at the same level and have roughly the same shape. The middle
peak can be slightly lower than the other two. As in the double formations, confirmation only
comes with a price breakout below the two bottoms. Throwbacks are common and diminish the
breakout performance. Figure 15.3 shows a triple top with a breakout down, and Figure 15.4
shows a triple bottom with a breakout up. As you can see, they are the mirror image of each other. ptg
Sometimes in a triple bottom the second peak is slightly higher than the first. This is favorable,
and the breakout is the line between the two peaks. The patterns are rare and usually depend on
the underlying market trend. They rank in the top third of classic patterns. Their failure rates are
very low (10% for bottoms, 4% for tops).

Standard Triangles
The rectangle pattern is bounded by parallel lines. If the same general pattern has nonparallel
boundary lines such that when extended into the future they cross each other, the formation is a
triangle pattern. Triangles can be the result of an upward-sloping lower bound or a downward-
sloping upward bound. Thus, there are a number of possible combinations of the two lines.
In this section, we look only at the standard triangle patterns. In these triangles, the point at
which the two lines extend and cross over each other is called the apex or the cradle, and the dis-
tance between the first high reversal point and the first low reversal point within the triangle is
called the base.
When the lower bound is a horizontal support zone and the upper is a downward slanting
trend line, it is called a descending triangle. When the lower trend line is rising and the upper
bound is a horizontal resistance zone, it is called an ascending triangle. When the upper bound
is declining and the lower bound is rising, it is called a symmetrical triangle. When both the
upper bound and lower bound are slanting in the same direction and converging, it is called a
wedge, and when the two lines are diverging regardless of slope, a reverse triangle, it is called a
broadening pattern. When we combine a broadening pattern with a triangle, usually a symmet-
rical triangle, we get what is called a diamond pattern.

Descending Triangle
Figure 15.5 shows a descending triangle with a breakout down. Its bounds are a lower horizontal
support line and a declining upper trend line; price should touch each line at least twice and
should generally “fill” the triangle’s space. It can be entered from any direction. The breakout is
more common to the downside (64%), but the upward breakout is more reliable and profitable
(47% average gain). This formation can be stretched high and wide and is sometimes difficult to
recognize. The trend lines defining its boundaries are almost never exact and are loaded with
false intrabar breakouts. A strict breakout strategy is required, therefore, as we discussed in
Chapter 13. However, prices often explode out of it and produce sizable gains. It can also be wild
and guarantee an exciting ride. It will break out and run, break out and pull back to its trend line,
break out and pull back to its cradle, or break back through the cradle, create a sizable trap, and
then reverse back in its original breakout direction and run. In other words, when you enter on a
breakout from a descending triangle, the subsequent action must be watched carefully.
Upward breakouts on gaps add considerably to performance and are definitely something
to look for. On downward breaks, gaps seem to have little effect.

Figure 15.6 pictures a descending triangle with a breakout up. The typical pattern shows
declining volume throughout its formation. However, increasing volume during the formation of
an upward breaking descending triangle, though less frequent, is more favorable than declining
volume. This contradicts the conventional opinion that advancing volume negates the pattern and
represents a reason for screening it out for consideration. In the downward breakouts, declining
volume during the pattern formation helps postbreakout performance only slightly. The amount
of volume traded on the actual upward breakouts has little effect on the postperformance, but in
downward breakouts, an increase on the breakout helps performance slightly.

Ascending Triangle
A horizontal upper bound of resistance combined with an upward sloping lower bound of sup-
port defines an ascending triangle (shown in Figure 15.7 with a breakout down). The characteris-
tics in this pattern are just as erratic as in descending triangles—lots of action up and down.
Breakout points must be chosen carefully because of the pattern’s nature to have many small
false breakouts, and declining volume is common but not necessary. Upward breakouts occur
77% of the time, and all breakouts usually happen roughly 61% of the distance (time) from the
base to the cradle. The overall performance rank is roughly in the middle of all patterns, a little
more favorable for downward breakouts. Failure rates are between 11% and 13% depending on
breakout direction. This is about average.

Symmetrical Triangle (Also “Coil” or “Isosceles Triangle”)
When the upper bound is downward sloping and the lower bound is upward sloping, a symmet-
rical triangle is formed (see Figure 15.8). The term symmetrical gives the impression that both
lines should have the same angle but in different directions. However, that the slope of the two
boundaries be formed at congruent angles is not a requirement. Thus, “symmetrical” is not an
accurate description but is the term most commonly in use for this pattern. The less-commonly
used term coil is often a more accurate description.

Like the other standard triangles, the prices must touch each border trend line at least twice
and meanwhile cover the area of the triangle with price action. Volume usually trends downward
during the pattern formation (86% of the time), and the breakout is usually upward (54% of the
time). Symmetrical triangles have many false breakouts and must be watched carefully. A strict
breakout system must be used that allows for such false moves. The breakout commonly occurs
between 73% and 75% of the length of the triangle from base to cradle. This formation does not
occur as frequently as the descending or ascending triangle, but it is still very common relative to
other chart patterns. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur 37% and 59% of the time, respectively,
and, as in most patterns, when they occur, they detract from eventual performance. This implies
that for actual investment or trading, the initial breakout should be acted upon, and if a pullback
or throwback occurs, the protective stop should be tightened. It does not imply that a pullback or
throwback should be ignored, but that instead, performance expectations should be less than if
no pullback or throwback had occurred. Gap breakouts do not seem to affect the performance on
the upside but do give a few extra percentage points on the downside. Increasing volume trend
seems to be associated with better results once the breakout occurs. High volume on breakouts,
both upward and downward, adds considerably to the performance of the formation and is some-
thing to look for. Overall performance is slightly below the mean for classic patterns.

BOX 15.6 TRADING TRIANGLES
The ideal situation for trading triangles is a definite breakout, a high trading range
within the triangle, an upward-sloping volume trend during the formation of the tri-
angle, and especially a gap on the breakout. These patterns seem to work better with
small-cap stocks in a rising market.
Triangles are plentiful. For example, the upward failure of a head-and-shoulders
top before any break through the neckline is a form of an upward breaking descend-
ing triangle. This is one likely reason that such head-and-shoulder top pattern fail-
ures are so profitable.
Although triangles are plentiful, their patterns suffer from many false and prema-
ture breakouts. This requires that a very strict breakout rule be used, either a wide fil-
ter or a number of closes outside the breakout zone. It also requires a close protective
stop at the breakout level in case the breakout is false. Once these defensive levels
have been exceeded, and price is on its way, the trader can relax for a little while
because the failure rate after a legitimate breakout is relatively low. Trailing stops
should then be placed at each preceding minor reversal.
ptg
There are many old rules about when a breakout should occur within a triangle.
Some, such as Murphy, say that one-half to two-thirds the distance from the base to
the apex is appropriate. Others, such as Edwards and Magee, use the one-half to
three-quarters rule. In fact, the breakout can occur at any time once the triangle has
been defined by legitimate upper and lower converging trend lines. Edwards and
Magee do point out that the longer the distance, the more likely the performance will
be less, but this also is not necessarily true. The highest percentage performance does
come from breakouts generally around 60%–70% of the distance from the base to
the cradle. However, in symmetrical triangles, the best performance comes from late
breakouts in the 73%–75% distance. Thus, the old rules are partially correct but not
strictly so.
Generally, the volume trend during the formation of a triangle declines, but in the
case of an upward breaking descending triangle, an ascending triangle, and a down-
ward breaking symmetrical triangle, an upward-sloping volume trend gives better
results. Declining volume is not a reason to disregard the pattern, however. Volume
on the breakout seems more desirable in symmetrical triangles, but it cannot hurt in
others. Gaps are better predictors of performance in the upward breaking descending
triangle and the downward breaking symmetrical triangle, but they are not necessary.
An initial target for these patterns is calculated by adding the base distance—the
vertical distance between the initial upper and lower reversal point prices—to the
price where the breakout occurred. In an upward breaking descending triangle, for
example, this target is reached better than 67% of the time. Other triangles have rel-
atively the same success rate—higher in upward trends than in downward trends.
This is why a wide trading range is preferred within the triangle—it suggests a
higher target price on the breakout.

Broadening Patterns
A broadening pattern exists when we take the standard rectangle pattern and draw the bound
lines diverging from each other into the future rather than converging as in a standard triangle. As
pictured in Figure 15.9, the price range is increasing during the broadening pattern, as opposed to
the narrowing price range that is associated with the standard triangle patterns. The terms mega-
phone, funnel, reverse triangle, and inverted triangle all refer to broadening patterns. The
broadening pattern also comes in many variations. One is similar to ascending and descending
triangles in that one of the bounds is horizontal. The other bound then slopes away from the hor-
izontal line either above or below. A final variation is the broadening wedge. This pattern is sim-
ilar to a wedge pattern (see Figure 15.9) only the bounds both trend in the same direction but
diverge instead of converge as in a wedge. None of these variations seems to have any above-
average performance statistics except the ascending broadening wedge, which has both bounds
rising and diverging. Upward breakouts in this pattern rank 6 out of 23 in Bulkowski’s scale and
have failure rates at 2%, almost negligible.
Broadening formations are the least-useful patterns for a number of reasons. First, they are
relatively rare in occurrence and are often difficult to identify. Second, and more important, they
are difficult to profit from. Because the boundary trend lines are separating over time, the break-
out lines are constantly moving away from each other. In an upward breaking broadening pat- ptg
tern, this means the upper breakout level is getting higher and higher along the upper trend line
(see Figure 15.9). By getting higher and higher, not only is it using up much of any potential gain
after a breakout, but it is also moving farther from any realistic protective stop level, thus increas-
ing the risk. Finally, the raw performance statistics show that performance of a broadening pat-
tern is average at best, and its failure rate is above average. One of the most profitable patterns
utilizing a broadening pattern, however, is when it is combined with a symmetrical triangle into
a diamond top, which we discuss next.

Diamond Top
One of the less-frequent but very profitable patterns is the diamond (see Figure 15.10). It consists
of a combination of a broadening pattern and a symmetrical triangle and usually occurs at the top
of a very sharp upward rise in prices. It is rare at price bottoms.

FIGURE 15.10 Diamond pattern with breakout down
Because it combines two types of triangles, the diamond is the most difficult to observe.
Remember that to establish a trend line, two extreme points that a line can be drawn between
must be identified. In a standard broadening formation, the upper trend line slopes upward and
must, therefore, have two peaks—the latter higher than the former. Likewise, the lower trend line
must have two troughs—the latter lower than the former—and each line must be formed at the
same time as the other. The first reversal point depends on the entry direction, of course, and
because diamonds are mostly top formations, the entry direction is generally from below. This
means that the first reversal point will be a peak. After that, the first trough will appear, then the
next higher peak, and then the next lower trough. When trend lines have been drawn to connect
these reversal points, we have a broadening formation. Now we must observe a symmetrical tri-
angle immediately after the broadening formation to establish a diamond pattern. The trend lines
in a symmetrical triangle converge, as in all standard triangles, and must also have at least two
peaks and troughs to establish each trend line. The first reversal peak and trough may be the last
reversal points in the broadening formation or the next reversal points following the broadening
formation. Often the trend lines in the symmetrical triangle will be parallel to the trend lines in
the broadening pattern, but this is not a requirement.
Bulkowski’s figures show that around 58% of the time, the preceding price action in a dia-
mond top was a steeply rising trend. When this occurs, the odds increase that the breakout from
the diamond will be downward and will be equally as steep, and 82% of the time, it will retrace

the entire prior rise. These figures are only valid for downward breakouts from a top, which
occur 67% of the time. Upward breakouts from a diamond top have a very poor performance his-
tory and should be avoided. Thus, action should only be taken once the pattern has been identi-
fied and the downward breakout has occurred.
Diamond bottoms have the same configuration as diamond tops and are the best patterns
that Bulkowski ranks. They are number 1 in performance when they fail and break down (about
31% of the time). Even when they break upward, their ranking is 8 out of 23.
As in most patterns, volume usually declines (67% of the time) during its formation, but
declining volume is not necessary. Indeed, rising volume is a plus for performance after the
breakout.
Pullbacks are very common in diamond patterns, occurring more than 53% of the time.
These pullbacks tend to detract from performance when they occur but are not that significant.
The best combination is when downward breakout occurs on below-average breakout volume
and no pullback. The failure rate is relatively low at 4%–10%. These low numbers equate, to
some extent, with risk. Combined with the above-average median return, these numbers suggest
that though rare, when a diamond top is identified, it has an above-average chance of being prof-
itable with minimum risk.
ptg
BOX 15.7 TRADING DIAMONDS
The diamond formation, once properly defined, tends to have a fast-moving price
run on the breakout. Indeed, if the postbreakout price behavior is sluggish, the posi-
tion should likely be closed or a close trailing stop placed near the current price. The
price objective is usually the distance that the entry price traveled to reach the dia-
mond. A steep entry is usually followed by a steep exit.
Wedge and Climax
A wedge pattern is a triangle pattern with both trend lines heading in the same direction. A rising
wedge has both lines headed upward, with the lower bound rising more quickly than the upper
bound, as pictured in Figure 15.11. The declining wedge has both lines headed downward, with
the upward bound falling more quickly than the lower bound. The lines cross in the future, just as
in a standard triangle, and the nomenclature for the crossover and height is the same.
Rather than the rectangle as the basis for this formation as it is with standard triangles, con-
sider a channel (see Chapter 12). A channel is two parallel trend lines either rising or declining.
In the earlier discussion of channels, we noted that when the channel line, drawn parallel to the
trend line through the opposite set of reversal points, begins to slope toward the trend line, it sug-
gests that players are becoming less enthusiastic with the trend line direction. For example, in an
upward-sloping channel, the channel line above the trend line connecting the downward reversal
points begins as a line parallel to the upward trend line. If a later rally within the channel fails to
reach the channel line, the new channel line through the new downward reversal and the last

downward reversal will have a lesser slope than the underlying trend line, and if projected into
the future, it will eventually meet the trend line. This new configuration of channel and trend line
is a rising wedge. It suggests, in the example, that sellers have become a little more anxious than
before, and by implication, it suggests that the trend line will soon be broken. Indeed, the statis-
tics bear this out. Almost all declining wedges (92%) break out upward, and most rising wedges
(69%) break out to the downside (Bulkowski, 2010).

FIGURE 15.11 Rising wedge with breakout down from a climax peak
Wedges are one of a few patterns that can be consolidation patterns against the prevailing
trend, consolidation patterns with the trend, or topping patterns, especially when accompanying
a climax. They occur more often during consolidations but are more dramatic after a climax.
Let us look at rising wedges first. Rising wedges occur either during a long downward
price trend or after an upward climax. The ones that occur during a downtrend appear as very
weak rallies against the trend. As mentioned previously, they invariably break again to the down-
side and continue the downtrend. Declining wedges are almost the same pattern and occur under
similar circumstances, only in the opposite direction.
A market climax occurs when prices accelerate, as shown in Chapter 12. At these times,
the underlying trend line is gradually adjusted at a steeper slope in line with the direction of
prices. In an upward accelerated trend, the support reversal points occur at levels higher than the
projected trend line and cause that trend line to be adjusted to a steeper slope. This can occur sev-
eral times as prices accelerate upward. The climax itself usually comes on extremely high vol-
ume and a sharp reversal. It is discussed later in Chapter 17. After a climax has occurred and
prices settle down, invariably a “test” occurs that attempts to rally back through climax extreme
peak. The pattern most often associated with the failure of that test—in other words, when the
test fails to exceed the climax extreme or only exceeds by a small amount—is a rising wedge
(refer to Figure 15.11). In the case of a climax low after a panic, the test wedge is the declining
variety (see Figure 15.12).

At a climax peak, when the test is a rising wedge pattern, the odds are extremely high that
the breakout will be downward. Because the emotion and commitment have been exhausted at
the climax peak and are unable to return during the test, the downward break in the wedge pat-
tern is the sign of a longer-term downward reversal. Thus, the wedge is a reversal pattern, even
though it may not occur at the actual climax peak high.
Other rising wedges can occur as a consolidation during a sustained downward trend and
occasionally will end at the top of a weakening upward trend. The latter we will see as a “fifth
wave diagonal” in the discussion of Elliott Waves in Chapter 20, “Elliott, Fibonacci, and Gann.”
Because trend lines often converge in the same direction when a wedge is not present,
Bulkowski requires that at least five reversal points be touched to qualify the pattern as a wedge.
This means three points on one trend line and at least two on the other. Otherwise, the pattern is
not accurately identified and may fail to show the results seen in actual wedge patterns.
Another characteristic of wedges, in both the consolidation and reversal varieties, is
declining volume during the formation of the wedge. Declining volume occurs in three-quarters
of the formations, and when it does, the postperformance improves over those wedges with
increasing volume. Breakout volume seems to be irrelevant to postperformance. Pullbacks and
throwbacks have high odds of occurring and when present detract from subsequent performance.
The performance rank for wedges is in the lower quartile of all the other classic patterns,
and its failure rate is considerably lower for upward breakouts (8%–11%) than for downward
breakouts (15%–24%). The rising wedge with a downward breakout is the least reliable.

BOX 15.8 TRADING WEDGES
It pays to wait for that breakout and to act immediately on it. In addition, because
wedges have such a high percentage of breakouts in the direction opposite from the
wedge direction, the direction of breakout is clear once the wedge is forming. A ris-
ing wedge invariably will break downward, and a declining wedge upward. When-
ever a climax has occurred, whether up or down, look for a wedge to form on the
test. This is one of the most profitable patterns of all. Just be sure that a wedge as
described previously is valid before you take any action.
PATTERNS WITH ROUNDED EDGES—ROUNDING AND HEAD-AND-
SHOULDERS
The patterns we have considered up to this point have been defined by straight lines. When we
begin to define patterns with curved lines, we become more indefinite than with using straight ptg
lines such as trend lines. This does not make the patterns any less useful, but it does make them
more difficult to describe specifically.
Rounding Top, Rounding Bottom (Also “Saucer,” “Bowl,” or “Cup”)
Rounding tops and bottoms occur are formed by price action that reverses slowly and gradually,
rather differently from the spike with very definite and sharp reversal characteristics. Volume in
the bottoms seems to follow the same trend of lessening as prices gradually approach the bottom
and increasing as they gradually turn upward again. In a rounding top, volume tends to follow the
same pattern of lessening as prices decelerate and increasing as prices gradually turn down.
Rounding usually takes time, and within its process, it has many minor up and down, very short-
term trends. Rounding is, thus, more conceptual than specific.
However, many formations depend on rounding for their description. The most famous is
the “cup-and-handle” formation described in detail by O’Neil (1988) but referred to in many ear-
lier publications. This formation, as shown in Figure 15.13, is a variation of the rounding bottom
that shows a “lip” after the rise from the bottom, and a small congestion area that reverses down-
ward for a short while called a “handle.” The high of the lip establishes, in this type of rounding
bottom, the resistance level to watch for an upward breakout. Sometimes the breakout never
occurs, and prices keep declining in the handle, continuing to new lows. Traditionally, the cup-
and-handle is considered to be a bottoming reversal pattern. However, Bulkowski has found that
when it is a continuation pattern from an earlier low, it is much more reliable and profitable. It
still only ranks 13 out of 23, despite its popularity.

Rounded bottoms are more common than rounded tops, but neither materializes very
often. They tend to be longer-term patterns, more easily identified in weekly or even monthly
charts. They are reversal patterns but can also appear in very long price consolidations. Shorter-
term rounded formations, often called “scallops,” are usually continuation patterns and are
equally difficult to define. Performance of rounded bottoms rank 5 out 23 in performance and
have a low 5% failure rate. Tops have the same performance rank, when breaking downward, but
a slightly higher failure rate of 9%–12%. They are difficult to recognize and often require weekly
or monthly charts to identify. They are also difficult to trade. First, the breakout level is not eas-
ily defined, except in cup-and-handle patterns. Second, they are slow to develop and often fail to

The head-and-shoulders pattern is probably the most famous technical pattern. Its name is often
used when ridiculing technical analysis, yet its profitability is very high, relative to other pat-
terns, and it is one of the few that the Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (2000) study showed had statis-
tical significance.
Head-and-shoulders is a complex pattern because it combines all three potential character-
istics of a pattern: trend lines, support or resistance lines, and rounding. It is most often seen at a
top or bottom, but it can occur in its normal state or as a failed formation in a consolidation.
Mostly, it should be traded only after it has formed completely. Its complexity causes many
impatient analysts to anticipate its formation and to act prematurely. Its performance and success
rate are high, but only after it has formed completely and satisfied all its requirements. We
describe the traits of a head-and-shoulders top. The bottom formation (see Figure 15.15) is the
reverse in every way except where noted.

An uptrend, but not necessarily long-term trend, precedes a head-and-shoulders top. Thus,
as shown in Figure 15.14, the head-and-shoulders top pattern is entered from below. (The head-
and-shoulders pattern can also occur within a consolidation rather than at the end of a trend, but
such occurrences are rare and more likely a series of triangles or a rectangle with a false down-
ward breakout at the “head.”)
The head-and-shoulders top pattern is a series of three well-defined peaks, either sharp or
rounded. The second peak is higher than the first and third peak. This middle, higher peak is
called the “head.” The first peak is called the “left shoulder,” and the third peak is called the
“right shoulder.” The left and right shoulders must both be lower than the head, but the two
shoulders do not have to be the same height. In fact, a left shoulder peak slightly higher than the
right shoulder peak adds a little to the postbreakout performance of a top formation. (A head-
and-shoulders bottom is pictured in Figure 15.15. In the bottom pattern, a right shoulder low that
is slightly lower than the left shoulder low adds to performance.)

FIGURE 15.14 Head-and-shoulders top with breakout down
The peaks in the head-and-shoulders top formation are roughly equidistant from each
other. The shoulders should appear roughly symmetrical about the head and should peak at
roughly the same level. Symmetry is important and makes the formation more identifiable.
Occasionally, more than two shoulders appear. These formations are called “complex head-and-
shoulders” and have roughly the same performance and failure rates as the standard two-shoul-
der variety. As in the standard, the multiple shoulders appear symmetrically on both sides of the
head. Rarely, a “two-headed” variety appears, and it, too, shows the same performance and fail-
ure rates as the standard. There is also the “unbalanced” version, as described by Edwards and
Magee, but it is difficult to describe accurately and seems to fit only those formations that might
be head-and-shoulders but cannot be formally categorized as such. The standard is the most
common, and the one to look for.

The bottoms between the peaks form a recognizable trend line. Technicians call this line
the “neckline.” Although the neckline is often horizontal, as in a support line, it also can be
downward or upward sloping. Indeed, there is some evidence that an upward-sloping neckline in
a top formation produces better performance than the standard horizontal neckline. (In a bottom
formation, the same rules hold except the neckline is now resistance rather than support. In a bot-
tom formation, a downward-sloping neckline increases postbreakout performance over an
upward-sloping neckline but not over the horizontal one.) Tilting the slope of the neckline to an
extreme, however, destroys the head-and-shoulders pattern and its likely consequences.
Volume is usually highest on the rise into and at the peak of the left shoulder and decreases
throughout the formation. This is not a requirement, however, as those formations with decreas-
ing volume, though slightly less frequent, seem to have a slight performance edge at tops.
(Increasing volume has a slight edge in head-and-shoulders bottoms.) Higher volume on either
shoulder does not affect performance at a top, but at a bottom, higher volume on the right shoul-
der than on the left shoulder adds considerably to postbreakout performance.
Breakout and action signals occur when prices, after completing the right shoulder, break
below the neckline. The breakout is a requirement for the formation. Second-guessing before
completion of the pattern can be dangerous. Sometimes, the right shoulder does not form com-
pletely, and prices fall short of breaking the neckline and rise to penetrate above the right shoul-
der peak. Not only is this a failure, but it also is an opportunity, provided the analyst had not
anticipated a breakdown and acted prematurely. The head-and-shoulders failure of this type is
very profitable, according to Schwager (1996). The standard failure, however, is when prices
break below the neckline and then reverse back upward through the right shoulder. This kind of
failure is relatively rare.
The breakout often occurs on increased volume, but decreased volume is not a sign of an
impending failure. It just occurs less frequently. Increasing volume on a bottom formation

improves performance, whereas decreasing volume on the breakout from a top pattern increases
performance.
Pullbacks or throwbacks are frequent—roughly 45%–63% for bottoms and 60%–67% for
tops. In summary, the head-and-shoulders pattern—aside from being the best known, even
among nontechnicians—is the most reliable and profitable of the classic formations.
The performance rank for the standard head-and-shoulders top is 1, the highest ranking
possible. Complex tops have a rank of 3, standard bottoms a rank of 7, and complex bottoms a
rank of 9. Both top and bottom patterns, therefore, are high on the list of performance.
We have seen in most other patterns that when a pullback or throwback occurs, the com-
parative performance suffers. This is also true in head-and-shoulders patterns. The failure rates
for both top and bottom formations are very low. Only 3%–4% failed a 5% gain or more from
tops and bottoms. In short, the head-and-shoulders formation has a high rate of reliability as well
as profitability.
BOX 15.9 TRADING HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS PATTERNS
Once a pattern has been observed using the preceding descriptive features, the neck-
line becomes the most important factor. The neckline is where the breakout level ptg
resides. Never should one act in anticipation of a break through the neckline. The
risk of failure is too great, and as we have seen with the upward break of a descend-
ing triangle, the strongest upward formation, the rise from descending peaks and a
flat neckline, can be substantial. This is equally true with head-and-shoulders bottom
formations. The ascending triangle with a breakout down is also a powerful forma-
tion. Thus, breakout stops should be placed outside the right shoulder reversal point.
Once the breakout is triggered, the risk of failure declines substantially. If the break-
out is through the neckline, use the standard statistics as a guide, but if the breakout
is a failed head-and-shoulders through the right shoulder extreme, use the appropri-
ate triangle statistics as a guide.
The price target for a head-and-shoulders pattern is relatively accurate. It is calcu-
lated like the others by taking the height of the formation and projecting it up or
down from the breakout price. The height is measured by drawing a vertical line
from the peak of the head to where it intersects the neckline and measuring the num-
ber of points between the two. This holds for flat as well as sloping necklines.
Shorter Continuation Trading Patterns—Flags and Pennants (Also
“Half-Mast Formation”)
For efficient use of trading capital, consider trading with flags and pennants. They are frequent
formations with extremely rapid and relatively reliable outcomes. After a breakout in either
direction or either pattern, prices usually run immediately, having very few pullbacks or throw-
backs and low rates of failure. Some successful traders use only flags and pennants because of

these advantages. Flags and pennants are really variations of the same formation. The flag is a
short channel that usually slopes in the opposite direction from the trend. The pennant is a short
triangle that does the same. Both of these patterns are pictured in Figure 15.16.
Flag Pennant
Price ptg
FIGURE 15.16 Flag and pennant in upward trend
Both flags and pennants are preceded by a steep, sharp price trend, best at 45 degrees
rather than straight up. Flag preceded by a rise of 90% or more have almost a zero failure rate
and an average return of 69%. This variety is the best of all chart patterns. Two parallel trend
lines in a small channel that resembles a flag form the pattern, and the slope of the channel can
be in any direction, but most commonly the best performance comes when it slopes away from
the preceding trend. Flag formations occur over a short period, usually a few days to a few
weeks; the best flag is less than 15 days. Volume usually declines throughout the formation of
the flag. In fact, this downward trend in volume is found in almost four out of every five flags
that occur.
The pennant pattern is the same as the flag except that the trend lines converge, forming a
miniature triangle, instead of being parallel. The direction of the formation is usually opposite
from that of the immediately preceding price trend, but in stronger moves, it can be horizontal or
even trending in the same direction as the underlying trend. Pennants differ from wedges in that
they are shorter in time and require a sharp move preceding them. Wedges tend to be longer-term
patterns. Falling volume throughout the formation is even more common with pennants; 90% of
pennants are characterized by a downward trend in volume.
Two types of failures can occur. First, a breakout in the opposite direction from the previ-
ous trend can occur. Second, a failure can occur after breakout. Because a flag or a pennant is
usually a continuation formation, the breakout should be expected in the direction of the preced-
ing trend, provided it is steep and sharp. When the breakout goes opposite to that trend, the fail-
ure invariably returns to the earlier trend, but only after a few heart palpitations have occurred
first and a few protective stops have been triggered.

BOX 15.10 TRADING FLAGS AND PENNANTS—MEASURED RULE
Because these patterns have low failure rates, few pullbacks or throwbacks, short
time periods, and steep trends preceding and following their occurrence, they are
very good trading patterns. One of the most important identification features is the
steep trend preceding the pattern. It is important to be cautious to make sure that a
complete formation has occurred and to wait for the breakout. The breakout occurs
when a trend line is broken, usually in the direction of the preceding trend. The price
target for these patterns is calculated by taking the distance from the beginning of the
sharp trend, not necessarily the beginning of the entire trend, to the first reversal in
the pattern and adding it to the breakout price. This method is called the “measured
rule” (see Figure 15.17) and usually only applies to flags and pennants. It implies
that the formation will occur roughly halfway through the entire steep price trend;
because of this, these patterns are also called “half-mast” patterns. The projection of
a target is only partially accurate (about 60% of the time), but because of the steep-
ness of the subsequent trend, close trailing stops are the best manner of protecting
profits.

LONG-TERM BAR CHART PATTERNS WITH THE BEST PERFORMANCE
AND THE LOWEST RISK OF FAILURE
We have selected several patterns to highlight based upon their combination of high gains and
minimum failure rates. Other patterns can also be successful if monitored closely, but the “edge”
appears to be in these patterns.
According to Bulkowski (2010), the best-performing patterns, considering gain and risk,
are the high-and-tight upward breaking flag, the head-and-shoulders top, top islands breaking
down (to be covered in Chapter 17), and upward breaking descending triangles. A summary of
these patterns is shown in Table 15.2.

CONCLUSION
In summary, the profitable use of chart patterns is not easy. The potential problems with recog-
nizing and acting upon chart patterns that we have discussed in this chapter highlight the need to
know thoroughly what we are doing. There are many variables in price behavior, mostly human,
and being human ourselves and subject to the same biases, we must be adaptable and recognize
that chart patterns are flexible.
It is unlikely that researchers will ever be able to prove definitively that patterns exist
because the mathematics are so complicated and because the marketplace is always changing. In
addition, many different patterns have been recognized, and right or wrong, they have been
described in the literature with nothing more than anecdotal evidence as to their reliability. If you
see a pattern described with no background statistical evidence as to its usefulness, it is best not
to bother with it. Today, most writers describing patterns will give some realistic evidence.
Although this evidence might be flawed, it at least shows that it has been the subject of some
serious study and, thus, is not merely a superstition.
The most reasonable approach for any chart reader is to take the classic patterns described
in this chapter and become experienced in their use. Although the performance of these patterns
will differ with different securities and with different trends in the general market, the behaviors of
these patterns have remained relatively consistent for over 100 years. We have discussed general

attributes of patterns that in several studies show promise, but the analyst must always adjust
parameters to fit the peculiarities of the security being analyzed. Profitable chart pattern analysis
is the result of determined study.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you should be familiar with
• The difference between one-point reversal and three-point reversal point-and-figure ptg
charts
• How to construct trend lines, recognize areas of consolidation, and determine the
count using one-point reversal point-and-figure charts
• How to construct trend lines, recognize basic patterns, and determine the count using
three-point reversal point-and-figure charts
In the previous chapter, we studied patterns that can occur when price information is displayed
on a bar chart. We continue our study of patterns, but now we focus on formations that are related
to point-and-figure charts. As we do this, we will notice that many of the patterns that the point-
and-figure analysts use are the same as those found on bar charts. For example, we will see the
head-and-shoulders pattern that we discussed in Chapter 15, “Bar Chart Patterns,” appear in this
chapter.
Before we delve deeply into point-and-figure chart patterns, let us take some time to
review point-and-figure chart construction. We learned about basic point-and-figure chart con-
struction in Chapter 11, “History and Construction of Charts.” Because these charts are not
familiar to most people, we will begin this chapter by exploring their construction in a bit more
depth.
You will often see “box” and “point” used interchangeably in discussing point-and-figure
charts. Although box is the proper word to use because it refers directly to the chart pattern, point
also is used to represent a box. A point in point-and-figure charts is not necessarily a one-dollar
price move, as in “the stock was up a point today” but represents one box on the chart. Obvi-
ously, the box size can be any consistent price difference, such as one dollar, two yen, twenty
cents, and so on. We will also interchange the terms point and box.

336 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT A POINT-AND-FIGURE CHART?
I should say that if anybody has a good enough memory to recall thousands of
changing figures, in hundreds of stocks, in a dozen averages, over a period of years,
he can absolve himself from the labor of keeping charts. (de Villiers, 1933, p 16)
Time and Volume Omitted
Point-and-figure charts appear odd at first because we are accustomed to having charts with time
along the horizontal axis. Those familiar with bar charts are also used to having volume plotted
along the horizontal axis. Point-and-figure charts, of course, have neither time nor volume por-
trayed. Both are considered irrelevant to the point-and-figure advocate. Price action is all that
such an analyst is interested in. Price is the focus. In this sense, a point-and-figure technical ana-
lyst is a purist. In the beginning of this book, we pointed out how price, not time nor volume, is
the single result of all information. Time and volume are ancillary factors that might or might not
have an effect on price. The analyst must concentrate on what a price change alone might suggest
ptg
for the future.
Of course, price change is the result of changes in supply and demand. Time is but one fac-
tor, and it is not important to those utilizing point-and-figure analysis. Similarly, volume might
be important but not by itself. An increase or decrease in volume is meaningless if the price
remains unchanged. Only when the volume affects price change does it become important. The
point-and-figure chart only plots price change, and volume and time then become unimportant.
As we saw in Chapter 15, volume is also suspect as a predictive factor for performance.
Increased volume can appear or not appear, for example, on breakouts, and the results are
roughly the same. Thus, the concept of volume has some weaknesses, all of which are avoided in
point-and-figure charts.
Continuous Price Flow Necessary
Point-and-figure charts require a continuous price flow to be accurate. Other methods of charting
prices divide price action into arbitrary periods and analyze the price action from period to
period. This creates the arbitrary time of open, close, high, and low, and although depictions of
these price points can be used, as we saw in the previous chapter, we must remember that they
are arbitrary, human divisions of time that may be unrelated to price action. Conversely, point-
and-figure analyzes all price action. In some periods, price action may be relatively dormant and
meaningless, while in other periods price action may be active and meaningful. Point-and-figure
relates only to that active period and disregards the inactive period. It, thus, screens out price
action that has little predictive ability and concentrates on that which does.
Often, price action outside of the local normal trading day is lost when using time period
charts. Requiring a continuous flow of price information, point-and-figure analysis is ideal for
interpreting the 24-hour markets that do not have a beginning or end in time and can flair up into

activity, especially in foreign exchange, at any time during the 24-hour period. Point-and-figure
analysis disregards those periods when trading is dormant and only concentrates on those in
which important activity occurs. After all, the point-and-figure method of charting developed as
a result of the invention of the ticker tape, the first means by which prices were reported in a con-
tinuous flow. Until then, prices were only recorded on a daily basis, an arbitrary cutoff that could
easily mask important price change information intraday or overnight. Point-and-figure is also
useful in futures markets where volume is unknown and not a consideration in trading. In short,
although seeming to be archaic, point-and-figure still has many uses and, as we shall see later in
this chapter, has been tested and found to have statistically positive results.
“Old” and “New” Methods
Only two variables, determined by the analyst, describe a point-and-figure chart: box or point
size and the number of boxes or points required for a reversal, called the reversal amount or
reversal size. This is important to understand because the early point-and-figure charts were
strictly one by one. In other words, the box size was one price interval such as a dollar in a stock
price, and the reversal amount was one box. The patterns that evolved using this method are more
complicated, are subject to analyst interpretation, and, thus, are more difficult to test statistically.
They are accurate portrayals of price action, however, because they include every price transac- ptg
tion in the particular security. Later, the one by three point-and-figure, called a three-box reversal
point-and-figure chart, became popular because it did not require as much data flow. It should be
plotted, as the one-box chart, using a continuous flow of price data, but it can be estimated from
daily prices in the newspaper. When estimated from daily prices alone, it loses its accuracy
because intraday price action that might have been meaningful is eliminated. The three-box
reversal chart does simplify analysis, however, because its method still screens out some unim-
portant price changes and produces an extremely simple, well-defined picture that can be tested,
as we shall see later.
When discussing point-and-figure, many people confuse the two types—the old and the
new—and assume that the rules and patterns for one are the same as for the other. As we will see,
however, the rules and patterns are quite different. Thus, the usage of the term point-and-figure
should always be qualified as to whether one-box reversal or three-box reversal is being dis-
cussed.
HISTORY OF POINT-AND-FIGURE CHARTING
We briefly discussed the history of the point-and-figure method in Chapter 3, “History of Tech-
nical Analysis.” Unfortunately, there are only a few written references to the method, mostly
books or pamphlets. Academic references are very few and generally unfavorably disposed,
being still caught in the old finance theory cult and not understanding how point-and-figure is
used by professionals.
Charles Dow, in 1901, mentioned a “book method” of plotting stock prices as they are
printed on the ticker tape. This method and a “method of keeping records of the fluctuations in

the price of stocks” (Hoyle from du Plessis, 2005) both describe a system very similar to present-
day one-box point-and-figure charts. At first, these charts plotted numbers (“figures”) on a graph
and later a vertical scale of prices was used with the trade prices represented by checks, ticks, or
crosses (Xs). The use of figures was then limited to 0 and 5 for clarity over long horizontal charts
and was still described by Wheelan’s textbook in 1954. Xs eventually became the standard for
marking prices until Blumenthal’s invention of the three-box reversal chart, when Xs were used
for advancing price columns and O’s for declining price columns.
The term figure likely came from the recording of prices. Later, in 1933, Victor De Villiers
in his booklet The Point and Figure Method of Anticipating Stock Price Movements described
both the figure method with prices in each box and the point method with Xs in each box and fig-
ures (5 or 0) in the prices rows that were multiples of 5 and 10. He mentions that figure charting
was old-fashioned and preferred the point method. His later book with Owen Taylor, also in
1933, used only point charts. He summed up the advantages of using charts: They “dispense with
statistics, fundamentals, values—real, absent, or presumed, news—past, present, and future, the
necessity for impulsive action, decisions based on conjecture, compulsion to interpret or deter-
mine the effect before the cause, and the confusion of mental processes in the task of prematurely
anticipating or discounting coming events.” De Villiers sounds like a true technician. Indeed,
some analysts refer to the old method of one-box reversal as the de Villiers method.
Wyckoff’s Stock Market Techniques No.2 written in 1934 also describes the one-box ptg
method. It is certain, then, that by the mid-1930s the figure method had been completely
replaced by the point method.
The next published pamphlet, which is extremely useful in the description and use of one-
point reversal charts, was by Wheelan (1954). It is still in print, and for anyone interested in the
original method of analysis, it is a gem. Wheelan’s instructional pamphlet takes the form of a les-
son plan and includes many practice exercises, chart paper, and subsequent commentary. It pro-
vides the best summary of the chart patterns used in the original one-box method. Wheelan
suggests that the student of point-and-figure keep an active chart on some commodity future
because futures trading is so fast acting that chart patterns unfold rapidly and give rapid feedback
of pattern analysis. He also suggests that two students work alongside each other because “points
that are obscure to one may be clear to the other, and the opportunity to exchange ideas will
greatly hasten the mastery of this analytical technique” (p. 4). His advice is still valid today.
In the 1960s, Dines, Andrews, Granville, and several others each published one-box rever-
sal chart services. The advent of the easier three-box reversal and the beginning of computer
plotting gradually put these services out of business. Until recently, several brokerage firms still
kept one-box reversal charts by hand, but these firms are getting fewer and fewer because the
computer has taken the job of plotting continuous data very well. Some specialists, market mak-
ers, and short-term floor traders keep a card for recording intraday price changes, which at one
time the exchanges provided, that are used for short-term trading and gauging price strength and
weakness. This method is also dying out, however, because these trading professions gradually
are being phased out as electronic trading takes over their functions on the trading floors.
“Upstairs” traders can rely on software that is designed to plot one-box charts, but they must be
careful that the data flow is continuous and not just the high and low of a time bar.
The newer method of point-and-figure, the three-point reversal method, is not a true point-
and-figure method because it does not rely on a continuous data stream. In some cases, only the

closing prices are used, but more often the high and low are interpreted as representing price flow
during the trading day.
Earl Blumenthal, the originator of the Chartcraft Service, devised and marketed the three-
box reversal method starting in 1947. Blumenthal introduced the three-point reversal method in
a privately published book titled Stock Market Trading. Updated revisions of the book were pub-
lished under similar names by Abe Cohen and later, Michael Burke, subsequent owners of the
Chartcraft service. In 1948, Blumenthal began the Chartcraft Weekly Service, which used three-
box reversal charts to keep subscribers up to date on the most active stocks traded at that time.
The service has since been sold to StockCube Ltd of Great Britain and is on the Web under the
address www.investorsintelligence.com.
In 1965, Professor Robert Earl Davis of Purdue University compiled a widely quoted per-
formance study on the eight basic three-point patterns. He examined the eight basic three-box
reversal patterns for 1,100 equities between 1954 and 1964. We refer to his study later in looking
at the effectiveness of this method. More recently, Dr. Carroll Aby (1996) and Thomas Dorsey
(2001) have written more complete books that bring the three-box method up to date. The influ-
ence of these pioneers in the three-point method has been so successful that many analysts are
unaware of the original more accurate but less definite one-point method.
Excellent compilations and descriptions of the point-and-figure method are available in
Zieg and Kaufman (1975) and Murphy (1999). The performance statistics in Zieg and Kaufman ptg
are from Davis (1965). Academic literature is limited to German publications (Hauschild and
Winkelman, 1985; Stottner, 1990). Also, a working paper by Professor John Anderson of
Queensland University of Technology presents a study of three-point patterns on the S&P 500
futures market from 1990 to 1998. More recently, Jeremy du Plessis (2005) has written a com-
prehensive book on point-and-figure that has become the primary source of information about
the method.
ONE-BOX REVERSAL POINT-AND-FIGURE CHARTS
Like bar chart patterns, patterns in one-box point-and-figure charts are not precise and require an
experienced analyst to interpret. This is likely another reason why they have lost their popularity
to the three-box version. Being imprecise also means that performance figures for patterns are
almost impossible to determine. No one has done the research into interpreting one-box point-
and-figure patterns as Bulkowski has in bar charts, so we are left with much conjecture and a dif-
ficult methodology.
One-box chart analysis focuses on consolidation areas, as do most chart methods, and
attempts to determine the next directional move and by how much that move will likely carry.
The one advantage of the one-box method is called the count, a means of anticipating the
expected price move by measuring the width of an observed price base. We cover the count later
in this chapter. In point-and-figure analysis, as in bar chart analysis, observation and analysis of
patterns is largely subjective and based on the experience of the analyst. Like fundamental analy-
sis, the experience of the analyst is the key to success.

340 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
Consolidation Area on the One-Box Chart (Also “Congestion Area”)
As we know from bar chart analysis, a consolidation area is a sideways movement in prices that
interrupts or reverses a trend. It is during this period of nontrending action that patterns develop
that signal the new direction once a breakout occurs and potentially the extent or target price for
the new directional price move. In point-and-figure, a consolidation area serves the same pur-
pose. Various patterns have been recognized over the past that inform the analyst what is likely to
occur in the future.
One observation, for example, is that when price changes occur more frequently at the
lower level of a consolidation area,the odds favor a breakout to the upside. The converse is true
when price changes occur frequently at the upper level of consolidation. Because one-box charts
plot so much information,the consolidation areas are often very wide,being made up of many
smaller price oscillations,just as in a bar chart. The important point in analyzing point-and-fig-
ure charts is to consider the consolidation area as a whole and ignore the smaller separate parts.
The analyst must determine where the price change work has been done,either in the lower or
upper level of the area,and place more emphasis on recent work than on past price changes. Fig-
ure 16.1 is an example of a one-box reversal chart with price action predominately in the lower
level of the consolidation and a subsequent breakout upward.

Trend Lines in One-Box Charts
Trend lines are drawn on a one-box reversal chart just as they are on a bar chart, connecting
highs to highs and lows to lows. These lines frequently outline standard patterns that we have
seen in bar chart analysis, such as triangles, rectangles, broadening formations, wedges, and
even flags and pennants. The same type of analysis used with bar charts can be applied to one-
box reversal charts. Figure 16.2, for example, shows a one-box reversal chart with a triangle
formed by two trend lines.

count. The count includes all squares along a horizontal price line from the left to the right of the
consolidation area, including any blank squares that might occur. When each side of the consol-
idation is a vertical line of some proportion, called a wall, the determination of where to locate
the horizontal line from which the count is determined is relatively easy. In most cases, a wall
does not exist, however,and the analyst must judge along what price line in the consolidation the
most number of filled squares occur. Figure 16.4 shows a consolidation with the left side being a
wall that is relatively easy to determine,the right side with a more difficult configuration,and
where the count might be applied. When the consolidation is irregular,the analyst must deter-
mine from experience with counts what the best price level to use would be.

FIGURE 16.4 Determining the count in a consolidation area by using the price at which the most num-
ber of squares are filled
The count determines the approximate extent of the next move. There appears to be a
direct relationship between the width of a consolidation and the vertical extent of the next rise or
decline. The count is one of the most valuable features of the one-box method. The three-point
method also has a count,but it is far less accurate,presumably because the three-point chart fails
to represent the complete flow of prices.
Generally, the count is more accurate in those stocks and commodities with a wide public
following. From the count, the analyst can estimate whether the next move will be small or large
and can determine risk-reward relationships to help in deciding whether to act on the breakout
signal.
Normally, the longer the consolidation area, the more difficult it is to establish a count
because of the many smaller rallies and declines within the base area that obscure the real begin-
ning and end of the consolidation area. Often a good starting point is the absolute high or low of
the area, but sometimes the price has been consolidating for a while before these levels are
reached. There are no definite rules for establishing the count, and academics have a fit over this
because the count cannot then be analyzed and evaluated. Nevertheless, despite the count’s prob-
lems, the width of the consolidation area does seem to have a relationship with the eventual dis-
tance of the next price move, and any reasonable estimate will have some value.
Once the count is determined, the distance of the count is then added to the right-hand
square with the last entry in the consolidation area. This is the standard method, though there are
variations. The result is as if the count line was rotated upward or downward around the last

square in the count (see Figure 16.5). The resulting price level projected from the distance of the
count is the objective for the next price move. It is surprising how accurate this method can be,
but, of course, it should never be depended upon solely. Other factors such as market direction,
change in supply or demand,or other informational changes can affect the eventual price target.
It is only an approximation.

Head-and-Shoulders Pattern
Many of the patterns observed in bar charts also occur in one-box charts. The most common is
the head-and-shoulders pattern (see Figure 16.6),but the rounded,double,and triple formations
are also seen. The implications of these patterns are the same as in bar charts, except that with the
ability of the count to estimate a price target, the patterns are more easily assessed for reward
versus risk. One-box reversal charts also have a few patterns of their own.

344 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
The Fulcrum
The fulcrum is a distinctive one-box reversal chart pattern. Indeed, some analysts call all reversal
patterns fulcrum, just as they call continuation patterns “semi-catapults.” The fulcrum is easily
recognized, occurs at both tops and bottoms, and gives a reliable count because distinct walls
usually contain it. Common characteristics in the fulcrum bottom (see Figure 16.7) are the fol-
lowing:
1. A downward trend entering the consolidation area
2. Sideways price activity near the low of the downward trend
3. A “mid-fulcrum” rally of short duration and around 15% amplitude that sometimes is mis-
taken for the beginning of a larger move
4. A testing of the earlier lows with some more sideways price activity
5. A “catapult” rally above the mid-fulcrum rally
All these variables can vary, of course, but the general pattern is easily recognized. De Vil-
liers mentioned three types of fulcrums, and Wheelan mentioned eight tops and eight bottoms.
Occasionally, more than one mid-fulcrum rally occurs, and the test can occasionally break below ptg
the initial sideways price action without damaging the implications of the formation. Two ful-
crums side by side is called a compound fulcrum, and a compound fulcrum with the second ful-
crum lower than the first is called a delayed-ending fulcrum. These formations are more
powerful than the single fulcrum once completed with the catapult breakout. Being familiar with
these fulcrum patterns,an analyst can spot similar patterns even in bar charts.

constitute ideal buying and selling points. When all of the following appear in the one-box point-
and-figure chart, the ideal buying situation exists:
1. The technical position of the market is favorable.
2. A clear and broad fulcrum appears after an extended downward trend.
3. The bottom of the fulcrum fulfills the maximum count from the previous top.
4. The bottom of the fulcrum occurs at a major support area.
5. The catapult occurs coincidently with the breaking of a downward trend line from within
the fulcrum or from the previous top.
6. The catapult occurs at a price level that has little or no resistance immediately above.
The ideal selling point occurs when all of the criteria are reversed.
THREE-POINT (OR BOX) REVERSAL POINT-AND-FIGURE CHARTS
The interpretation of one-box charts is obviously difficult and takes considerable skill and expe- ptg
rience. A more user-friendly method is the three-box reversal chart. It had the advantages of
being plotted from prices in the newspaper and required the knowledge of only a few basic pat-
terns. It appealed to academia because the patterns could be identified and tested, and it appealed
to nontechnicians because it was easy.
The method for plotting three-box reversal charts became standardized to the point where
the Chartcraft price scale is now referred to as “traditional.” Price scales have also evolved, how-
ever, to account for percentage change rather than arithmetic change, and logarithmic scales are
often a choice in the popular software programs that plot point-and-figure charts. Although the
method has other peculiarities, such as trend lines at 45-degree slopes and odd-named patterns
such as “high poles” and “long tails,” the various tests of its success rate, though few, have shown
extremely good results from following the signals on a mechanical basis.
Professor Davis (1965) studied the results from each of the eight basic patterns over ten
years and 1,100 stocks. His method was to act on a signal from one of the patterns and close the
position when a simple reversal signal occurred. Sometimes theoretical positions would overlap,
as when more than one signal occurred before the closing criteria was met, but the data was
accrued for each signal as if it were independent. Davis’s results were tabulated by signal and the
percentage profitable as well as the average gain or loss was recorded.
Professor Anderson used the same method on eight years of S&P 500 futures prices, by
year, and tabulated the gains, losses, and percent profit from each of the eight standard patterns
adjusted for different box sizes ($100 and $200) and reversal numbers (three, four, and five
boxes). Unfortunately, Professor Anderson used a $100 commission rate for round-turn trades
when a more accurate commission would have been closer to $5. His results show worse per-
formance than would be expected today but even with the high commission are still largely pos-
itive. We have adjusted the overall profitability of his results, but not knowing the details of each
trade, we could not adjust the profitability percentage for each signal. In both studies, Davis and
Anderson, the results show very favorable results for all eight signals.

Trend Lines with Three-Box Charts
Trend lines in three-box reversal charts are drawn at 45-degree angles, as demonstrated in Figure
16.8. This method is somewhat spurious. There is little reason for drawing trend lines in this
manner,but regardless,it has become the convention for these charts.

FIGURE 16.8 Trend lines
Becausethe method only allows one upward and one downward trend line,each has a sep-
arate name. The upward trend line, drawn one box below the last observable column (always an
O column) after a buy signal from a base, is called the bullish support line. The opposite, the
down trend line drawn one box above the latest top column (always an X column) after a sell sig-
nal from a top, is called the bearish resistance line. Each is treated equivalently relative to its
direction.
The general rule for these lines is that one should never buy unless prices are above the
bullish support line and, conversely, should never sell unless prices are below the bearish resist-
ance line. The initial lines may last for years, depending on the slope of the subsequent advance
or decline. When a price penetrates a trend line by one box at the same time that a pattern signal
occurs, the signal has added importance. Unfortunately, the tests on signals did not include this
qualification.

Chapter 16 Point-and-Figure Chart Patterns 347
Another, even more questionable, line is drawn on three-box reversal charts. This is a line
similar to the channel line in a bar chart in that it runs parallel to the trend line through the oppo-
site extreme prices. Thus, a bullish support line that travels upward beginning at the bottom of
the base can have several bullish resistance lines drawn through successive peaks in the price
rise. These lines are considered to be levels at which future rallies will halt, similar again to the
standard channel line.
The Count Using Three-Box Reversal Charts
Analysts use two methods of determining a target price on three-box reversal charts—the verti-
cal and the horizontal count. However, because the three-box reversal method eliminates much
of the price action that might occur within the three boxes and often does not include the contin-
uous stream of prices, the counts are not as accurate as in the one-box method. Nevertheless, they
do provide an approximate target, one that can be more confidently accepted if both the vertical
and horizontal counts agree.
Calculating Horizontal Count
The horizontal count is very similar to the count in a one-box chart. The walls on either side of
ptg
the base are the starting points, and the distance in boxes is measured between them. In Figure
16.9, the width of the base is 5. The distance is then multiplied by the dollars per box. In Figure
16.9, the price per box is 0.5 at the point where the base is formed. The base of 5 is multiplied by
the price per box of .5 to get 2.5. Next, an adjustment is made to account for the approximate loss
in price action using a three-box reversal; in our example, 2.5 is multiplied by 3 because the
reversal amount is three boxes, resulting in 7.5. This figure is then added to the lowest point
in the formation, which in our example is 15 1/2, giving a price target on a bullish signal of 23
(15 1/2 + 7 1/2). The fact that at 23,the box sizes are one point per box is irrelevant. Remember
that this is different from the count in a one-box chart,where all boxes are the same size.

==================================================

348 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
Calculating Vertical Count
The vertical count is unique to the three-box reversal. It is calculated by taking the number of
boxes in the column in which an action signal has occurred, multiplying it by 3, and adding the
product to the lowest box price in the column. If the box values are different because of scale
changes during the column’s formation, the value of the column boxes must be adjusted. In the
example (see Figure 16.10), the scale does not change over the relevant range. Thus, the prices
are all 1/2 point per box for seven boxes in the column in which the buy signal occurred, multi-
plied by 3 to adjust for the three-box reversal, which equals 10 1/2, which is then added to the
lowest box price of 15 1/2 to get a vertical count of 26. In some cases, the initial signal is only a
three-box column. If the base is sufficiently large, the two columns coming out of the base at the
signal can be used. A special situation exists in short sales from a top. In these cases, the down-
ward projection is a function of multiplying by 2 instead of by 3.

The Eight Standard Patterns for Three-Box Reversal Charts
There are eight standard patterns used with three-box reversal charts. They are as follows:
• Double top or double bottom
• Rising bottom or declining top
• Triple top or triple bottom
• Ascending triple top or descending triple bottom

Chapter 16 Point-and-Figure Chart Patterns 349
• Spread triple top or spread triple bottom
• Bullish or bearish triangle
• Above bullish resistance line or bearish support line
• Below bearish resistance line or bearish support line
Let us look at each of these eight patterns. Then we will look at a few additional minor three-box
reversal formations.
Double Top and Double Bottom
Double tops and bottoms are the simplest of all patterns. The double pattern consists of only
three columns: two X columns and one O column for the double top or two O columns and one
X column for the double bottom. The nomenclature is different from both bar charts and one-box
point-and-figure charts in that “top” designates the point at which a breakout occurs rather than a
description of the pattern formation as being bearish. Indeed, a top—double or triple—is a bull-
ish formation once the upward breakout occurs. The signal comes when the third column breaks
above or below the first column, as shown in Figure 16.11. All other standard formations with the
exception of lines have a double top or bottom within them. Davis found the double top to be
ptg
profitable 80.3% of the time and the double bottom to be profitable 82.1% of the time. Anderson
found their combined profitability to be tied for third best of the eight patterns, returning
$1,371,810 in 18,278 trades over nine years.

Rising Bottom and Declining Top
The rising bottom and declining top are variations of the double top and double bottom. Four
columns are required for these formations. The rising bottom is formed by an initial X column,
followed by an O column,a second X column,and then a second O column. For the pattern to be
a rising bottom requirement,the first column of Os in the double top must have a lower low than
the most recent column of Os. The rising bottom pattern is pictured in Figure 16.12.
Usually the first column of lows declines from a much higher lever than shown in Figure
16.12. One possible variation is for the prior column of Xs to be stronger. The declining top pat-
tern is just the opposite of the rising bottom pattern. Figure 16.12 also shows a diagram for a
declining top formation.

Triple Top and Triple Bottom
Thetriple top and bottom patterns require that prices break above or below two prior highs or
lows. It, thus, provides more confirmation that a change in trend has occurred. As a result, it
tends to be more profitable than the double top and bottom but occurs less frequently. Figure ptg

the eight standard patterns and produced $320,795 over nine years and 2,201 trades for an aver-
age profit per trade of $145.70.
Ascending Triple Top and Descending Triple Bottom (Also “Diagonal”Triple Top or
Bottom)
Ascending triple tops and descending triple bottoms are varieties of the triple top and bottoms. In
the ascending triple top,three rows of Xs occur,with the second row of Xs breaking through the
top of the first and the third row of Xs breaking through the top of the second. This is really two
double top formations right after each other,denoting a strong upward price trend. An ascending
triple top is shown in Figure 16.14.

descending triple bottom was profitable 83.3% of the time. Anderson reported that this pattern
produced profits but at a level below the average of the other eight standard patterns.

Spread Triple Top and Spread Triple Bottom
The spread triple top (bottom) is a special case of the triple top (bottom). Spread triple tops and
bottoms are a little more complicated,and,thus,occur less frequently. The pattern requires at
least six columns and usually more. It is somewhat similar to the fulcrum pattern in the one-box
chart because it has a congestion area followed by a premature breakout and then another con-
gestion area. The signal comes when the premature breakout is exceeded,just as in the fulcrum
pattern.
Thus, in a spread triple top,there are three tops to be exceeded,with one or more lesser
tops in between the major ones. A breakout must rise above all. Figure 16.15 provides a graph of
a spread triple top and the spread triple bottom. You will notice that in the spread triple bottom,
three major bottoms occur, with lesser bottoms between the major ones.

Davis reported that the spread triple tops were profitable 85.7% of the time, and spread
triple bottoms were profitable 86.5% of the time. Anderson’s results were not as favorable. His
report showed very small profits (only $37.9 per trade) and rare occurrences (429 over nine
years). Thus, they were patterns that probably should be eliminated from the list of useful three-
box reversal patterns.
Bullish Triangle and Bearish Triangle
The triangle in three-box reversal charts is similar to the symmetrical triangle we saw in bar chart
patterns in Chapter 15. Figure 16.16 depicts both a bullish and bearish three-box reversal trian-
gle. The triangle is very rare in three-box reversals, however, because it is relatively complicated
and because three-box reversals cover a longer period of time than it takes for most bar chart tri-
angles to form. The three-box reversal, therefore, only picks up those triangles that form over a
longer period and that are uncommon. The pattern requires that columns converge by having suc-
cessively lower highs and higher lows, as depicted in Figure 16.16.
The patterns studied by Davis and Anderson were continuation patterns because the break-
out was required in the direction of the previous trend. As we know, triangles can be reversal pat-
terns also, but these have not been analyzed for performance.

Davis reported that the upward breaking bullish triangle was profitable 71.4% of the time
and the downward breaking bearish triangle was profitable 87.5% of the time. Anderson could
only find a combined 70 examples of these formations,and their performance was a miserable
$11.70 per trade. This is another pattern that could easily be disregarded.
Rising and Declining Trend Lines
In a rising trend,a trend line is usually drawn below the lows of each smaller correction within
the trend. In three-box reversal charts,the trend line is drawn at a 45-degree angle from the bot-
tom and is labeled the bullish support line. Another parallel line, similar to a channel line, is
often drawn through the earliest peak in the upward trend, again at a 45-degree angle, and is
called the bullish resistance line.

Prices can penetrate these lines in only two ways. They can break below the bullish support
line, traditionally considered a major change in the long-term trend and called a “bullish reversed
pattern” without the trend line, or prices can break above the bullish resistance line, suggesting
that the upward trend has accelerated.
The upward breakout through a bullish resistance line, as shown in Figure 16.17, comes at
the end of a strong move. This type of breakout is likely the last gasp in the trend direction. To be
jumping on the trend at this late time is dangerous and likely wrong. On the other hand, the break
of the underlying bullish support line has more validity because it signals a potential reversal in
trend, just as breaking a trend line in a bar chart would imply.

FIGURE 16.17 Breakouts from bullish resistance and bullish support lines
These breakouts are not specifically a pattern in the sense that a pattern usually is defined
by two boundaries,but because of the peculiar nature of the trend being drawn at 45 degrees with
little supporting evidence,the breaks have been evaluated for performance. In truth,the results
from these two combinations of trend lines should not have been combined as they were.
Instead,it would have been more informative to combine the channel lines together and the trend
lines together. For this reason,the results from both studies are likely flawed and not good guides
as to the success or failure of any of these techniques.
Nevertheless, Davis reported that the upward break profited 82.6% of the time, and the
downward break profited 85.7% of the time. Anderson found only 49 examples in nine years, but
these examples produced a profit per trade of $219, the highest per-trade profit of all the eight
patterns. It’s too bad they occur so infrequently.
Declining trend lines are just the opposite of the rising trend lines except that they appear in
declining trends. There is an upper line, the bearish resistance line, and a lower line, the bearish
support line. Both the bearish resistance line and the bearish support line are pictured in Figure
16.18.
Davis claimed a profit an extraordinarily high 92.0% of the time for breaking upward
through the bearish resistance line, what is also called a bearish reversed pattern without the

trend line. Zieg and Kaufman did not provide statistics from Davis’s work on the profitability of
a downward break. Anderson, however, found that the combination of breaks lost money. This
makes sense. A 45-degree downward trend line is not usually steep enough during a decline to
capture the price movement. Declines tend to occur more quickly and at a steeper slope than
advances. Thus, a number of premature breakouts downward would not be surprising and seem
to be what occurred in the S&P futures that Anderson monitored. The number of occurrences he
noticed was only a paltry 63 over nine years.

Other Patterns
In addition to the eight standard three-box reversal chart patterns,several other formations are of
interest to the technical analyst. Three such formations to be aware of are the catapult,the spike,
and the shakeout.
Catapult
Dorsey calls the catapult a “confirming” formation. It results from the pullback or throwback
after the breakout from a triple top or bottom formation. Cohen maintained that a catapult would
occur in roughly 50% of triple formations. As such, it is just a combination of a triple formation
and a double formation.
Figure 16.19 depicts a bullish catapult. In this chart, the triple breaks out in the third col-
umn of Xs. A column of Os follows, in a throwback. As the next column of Xs occurs, a double
formation then occurs.
As a formation, the bullish catapult is powerful, but it also provides a chance to enter at a
slightly more favorable price. The time to enter is on the throwback, perhaps only a half position.
Place a stop outside of the reversal point prior to the throwback. In the bullish catapult (see Fig-
ure 16.19), the throwback enters the triple top formation and provides a better buying price than

when it originally broke out. In addition, the bottom at which a protective stop should be placed
is closer, giving better risk-reward odds. Another buy order can be placed when there is a break-
out from the double top.
A bearish catapult is also pictured in Figure 16.19. It is the same thing as the bullish ver-
sion except in reverse. Sell orders should be handled in the same manner that buy orders were
handled with the bullish catapult.

Spike (Also “Long Tail”)
Occasionally,a price change continues in a straight line fora considerable distance on a three-
box reversal chart,leading to a tall column of Xs or Os. This often occurs at a climax after an
accelerated trend has reached its climax. In Figure 16.20, the long column of Os forms what
looks like a long tail.
How should trading be handled when a long tail or spike occurs? Using traditional signals,
the next reversal (the X column) would have to travel the entire distance back to the starting
point before a signal is given. It would be fairly obvious that prices are in an uptrend, and an
uptrend that the investor would want to be riding, before prices made it all the way back up the
length of the tail. Therefore, different authors have tried to develop rules for trading when these
tails and spikes occur.
The main question to be resolved is how far the straight line run in prices has to travel
before it is considered a spike. Cohen argued that 10 boxes were sufficient to establish a spike;
Blumenthal argued for 20 boxes; and Burke reported that 17 to 20 would be sufficient. Dorsey
mentions a “long tail down,” using a decline of 20 boxes without a reversal as his criterion; at the
first reversal, he suggests a buy for a short trade on the long side. In summary, however, the
answer is not clear as what the best number of boxes is, but the principle is valid especially if the
overall market is at a long-term extreme.

Shakeout
The shakeout pattern is a deceptive pattern that plays on traders and investors who sell on the
first sign of difficulty in an uptrend. It is displayed in Figure 16.21. The first column of Xs indi-
cates a strong upward trend. Then the two columns of Os form a double bottom. This double bot-
tom breakdown in a strong rising market often “shakes out” a number of traders and investors
who have profited and want to exit the position. Under normal circumstances, the double bottom
pattern would be a signal to sell, but in this case, it pays to buy instead of sell. The reason is that
the trend is still upward, and the first correction is just temporary within a trend that will soon
resume upward.
Trading in this situation can be tricky. It is important to remember that this pattern occurs
early during a strong uptrend. Dorsey provides several rules to make sure the pattern is used cor-
rectly:
• The stock and market must be in an uptrend.
• The stock should be trading above its bullish support line.
• The stock price must form two tops at the same price.
• The reversal from these two tops gives a double bottom sell signal.
• This sell signal is the first that has occurred in the uptrend.
• The relative strength chart must be showing Xs in the recent column or be on a buy
signal.

CONCLUSION
The charts we have considered in this chapter might not look as familiar to you as the bar charts
we have focused on in previous chapters. These point-and-figure charts record only price action;
time and volume figures are omitted. Remember,the main objective of the technical analyst is to
determine price trends in order to profit.
The original, one-point reversal point-and-figure charts require continuous price data.
Many investors do not have access to this detailed intraday data. The three-point reversal point-
and-figure method was developed as a way in which investors could use intermittent data, such
as that reported daily in newspapers, to construct charts. Although some of the price action is lost
in these charts, the three-point reversal point-and-figure chart has become the more standard type
of point-and-figure charting. These charts have some unique characteristics, such as trend lines
drawn at 45 degrees, which we have looked at in this chapter. Because of their uniqueness, these
charts require extra study time and effort to learn; however, this study can be profitable for the
serious student of technical analysis.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Time and volume are not pictured on a point-and-figure chart. Explain why point-and-fig-
ure analysts might consider these two factors irrelevant to their analysis.
2. Why might one-point reversal point-and-figure charts be a useful tool for an analyst fol-
lowing currency trading?

•
How short-term patterns can be used as a tool to identify reversals in longer-term
trends
•
The types of gaps that occur on bar charts and the significance of the various types
•
Wide-range days and narrow-range days and their implications for volatility
•
The formation and interpretation of the most common candlestick patterns
In previous chapters, we looked at longer-term patterns in bar charts and point-and-figure charts.
We now turn our attention to short-term patterns. In this chapter, our focus is on short-term pat-
terns on bar charts and candlestick charts. These patterns concentrate on the configuration and
characteristics of individual bars, such as the height of the bar and the position of opening and
closing prices on the bar. Some patterns also compare one period’s bar with the preceding bar.
Despite what their title suggests, short-term patterns are not limited to a particular short-term
period, like one day. In this instance, “short-term” means a small number of bars. For example,
on a daily bar chart, short-term patterns may form from one or two days of trading data, but on
an hourly bar chart, a two-bar short-term pattern would include two hours’ worth of trading data.
Although the longer-term patterns we have considered can be useful by themselves, they
occur less frequently than shorter-term patterns. On the other hand, the shorter-term patterns we
consider in this chapter are not useful by themselves but are very common. Why do short-term
patterns occur more frequently than longer-term patterns? Think of a common bar chart; four
pieces of data are represented on each bar: an open, close, high, and low. With only four pieces
of information, the number of various combinations in which these variables can occur is small.
Even though stretching out the pattern to several bars increases the number of possible combina-
tions, the number is still relatively small, and these combinations occur very frequently.

360 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
Unfortunately, frequent patterns often give false signals. Although most market turning
points include one or more of the short-term patterns covered in this chapter, these same patterns
also occur at places where a reversal fails to follow. As Schwager (1996) states when referring to
the one-day reversal pattern, it “successfully call(s) 100 out of every ten highs” (p. 89). Like
Schwager, many others have been skeptical about the validity of short-term patterns. Just how
useful and effective are they? Although some empirical tests suggest that these short-term pat-
terns are not effective, many of the tests have covered longer testing periods than would be seen
in practice. In most successful tests, short-term pattern entry signals are closed either at the close
of the same day, the opening of the next day, the first profitable opening (called the “bailout” by
Larry Williams), or the first profitable closing, which usually is only a few days later, barring the
position first being stopped out. The ability to test over these short periods requires high-fre-
quency data on a tick-to-tick basis and is usually beyond the capability of the normal investor or
academic.
Nevertheless, once fully understood, short-term patterns are useful not only for trading but
also for entering and exiting longer-term positions at more favorable prices. Although the aver-
age investor would not usually have the time or computer equipment and data feed to watch for
short-term patterns, the professional trader certainly has the ability to watch intraday price
behavior and can improve job performance and profits by understanding the nature of short-term ptg
patterns.
The basis for short-term patterns is to anticipate a sudden move, similar to the breakout
concept in larger patterns, to take advantage of a period when prices have reached an emotion
extreme, or to enter into a trend at an advantageous price as on a pullback or throwback. The
methods usually have what is called a “setup.” A setup occurs when certain known factors
needed to establish the pattern have occurred, and the trader is waiting for the action signal to
occur. In larger charts, we have seen this concept in patterns. When the pattern, such as a trian-
gle, forms, the setup is the pattern formation. If this pattern formation does not abide by the rules
of triangle formations during its creation, it is not a setup, and we ignore it. If it does form cor-
rectly, we wait for the breakout, which is the action signal. Traders use the short-term patterns in
the same manner, but over shorter time horizons, and they use tighter stops and exit signals.
Because short-term patterns are relatively frequent and usually depend on the previous
trend as well as other factors, the prior trend must be known before short-term patterns can be
used. A top pattern in a downward trend is obviously meaningless, for instance, and, thus, all top
patterns can be disregarded from consideration during a declining trend. This leaves only bot-
toming patterns to consider during a downward trend. Also, a short-term reversal pattern should
only be considered necessary when prices are at some kind of support level, resistance level, or
trend line. Whenever many bits of evidence occur at a particular price and time, it is called a
“cluster” of evidence. Once a cluster of evidence begins to form, the analyst should begin look-
ing for a short-term pattern. It then can be useful in signaling when and where to act as well as
what the price risk might be.
Short-term patterns can also be used to determine when upward or downward momentum
is slowing. In the next chapter, “Confirmation,” we cover oscillators and indicators that deter-
mine momentum, but for now, remember that instead of using a momentum signal for action,
using short-term patterns can often signal more precisely when to act and what risk exists once
momentum begins to slow.

Chapter 17 Short-Term Patterns 361
Although short-term patterns are usually reversal patterns, they can be used as continua-
tion patterns in corrections within a trend. For example, in a strong upward trend, when the price
corrects or retraces in a normal manner and a cluster of evidence forms that indicates the earlier,
longer trend may soon continue, a short-term bottom reversal or continuation pattern may signal
when to act. Usually, however, short-term patterns are best when they occur right at a peak or
trough. Minimum action should be taken, however, unless there is a cluster of evidence that a
longer-term reversal is due or that a strong trend is due to continue. For example, in an uptrend,
if a price is near previous resistance, under but close to an important moving average, and has
reached a price target, a short-term reversal top pattern is likely valid and worth acting upon. If a
short-term reversal pattern of any kind occurs without supporting evidence, it might or might not
signal an actual price reversal; it might simply signal that a slight consolidation period is next.
Short-term patterns are also the first sign that a reversal is nearing. They act very quickly,
often occurring on the actual peak or trough day. As such, they lead most other patterns, which
take time and further price action to develop. In a head-and-shoulders top pattern, for example,
the analyst must wait for the actual breakout below the neckline before acting, but a short-term
reversal pattern might have already indicated a potential reversal right at the top of the head.
In experimenting with short-term patterns, the technical analyst should consider several
variables: ptg
• The more complex the pattern, the less frequently it is going to occur. Some analysts
have libraries of hundreds of patterns they have found useful in the past and through
experimentation and use a computer-screening program that will pump out all the rele-
vant patterns before each trading day. This gives them an edge but is impractical for
most traders.
• The relationship between bars in a pattern need not be just a matter of the position of
the high, low, open, and close to each other. The relation can be a proportional one
rather than an exact one (Harris, 2000) where, for example, the close is in the lower
33% of the trading range, or the range that is three bars earlier is one-half the range of
the last bar.
• The pattern may be split between two time periods, whereby one pattern appears at
one time, and at some predetermined time later, another pattern must appear.
• The entry may be delayed by some predetermined time.
• The pattern may relate to another market entirely, whereby, for example, a pattern in
the bond market may give a signal in the stock market or a currency.
These variables make the search for reliable patterns exceedingly complex and likely
beyond necessity. The old principle of keeping things simple should be applied to any kind of
pattern recognition search.
We divide the types of patterns into traditional bar chart patterns and candlestick patterns.
Candlestick patterns portray the raw data of open, close, high, and low differently than a bar
chart, but their patterns are very similar to bar chart patterns. Part of the appeal of candlestick

charts is not so much the patterns but the visual ease with which the analyst can “see” intraday
pressures on price and the price trend. They also have peculiar but memorable names for specific
patterns that make them engaging.
As in all patterns, experience will separate the winners from the losers. Anyone using such
patterns should record in a notebook the successes and failures from interpreting short-term pat-
terns. Reviewing this recording periodically will help the investor develop a better “feel” of his
ability to act profitably and learn where mistakes more frequently occur. Every trading vehicle
has its own “personality.” Success is often a function of understanding the peculiarities of the
trading vehicle most commonly traded.
PATTERN CONSTRUCTION AND DETERMINATION
The principal data used in short-term patterns—both traditional and candlestick, regardless of
bar time—is open, close, high, and low. The opening price is traditionally considered the price
established from any news, emotion, anticipation, or mechanical signals that have built up
overnight. Most professional day traders, scalpers, and even swing traders prefer to avoid it.
ptg
They wait for some action—a gap or opening range—to take place before judging the tone of the
market.
Because the closing price is the final price of the day and the one at which most margin
accounts are valued, it is like a summary of the bar’s activity. If the close is up, the majority and
most recent action was positive; if the close is down, the majority and most recent price action
was to the downside. Professionals use it as a benchmark with which to compare the next day’s
price action. Most people reading the financial news remember and use it to value their accounts.
The closing price becomes a benchmark for future action, both long and short term. Some traders
consider it the most important price of the day, even though it is somewhat arbitrary.
The high is the upper extreme reached by buyers during the bar and is, thus, a measure of
buying ability and enthusiasm. On the other hand, the low is the lower extreme reached by sell-
ers during the bar and is, thus, a measure of selling ability and fear.
The configuration, length of the bar, position on the bar, preceding bar data, and price dis-
tance between each determine the pattern. As you might guess, there is a multitude of potential
combinations, and all have been investigated for ways to profit. We present next just a few of the
large array of short-term patterns that have shown promise in the past.
TRADITIONAL SHORT-TERM PATTERNS
Let us look at some of the short-term patterns and their trading implications. These are patterns
in use today that by themselves are warnings, at best, but not necessarily action patterns, that
should be followed without a cluster of other evidence. You will notice that none of the patterns
includes moving averages. Over short time periods, especially when the period is interrupted by
inactivity, moving averages are not reliable. For example, when using five-minute data, the only
moving average with any value would be very short because the period from one day to the next

Chapter 17 Short-Term Patterns 363
is interrupted by a long period overnight when no trading activity occurs. In 24-hour markets,
short-term moving averages have more value because the markets are open continuously.
Gaps
Gaps occur when either the low for the current bar is above the high for the previous bar or the
high for the current bar is lower than the low of the previous bar. Figure 17.1 pictures a gap
down. The “hole” or “void” created in the price history is a “price range at which no shares
changed hands” (Edwards and Magee, 2007). A price gap might or might not have significance.
We have seen them before in analyzing breakouts from classic patterns, trend lines, and support
or resistance zones, and in those instances, the gaps were demonstrating the beginning of a new
trend. However, gap types differ based on the context in which they occur. Some are meaningful,
and others can be disregarded.

364 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
Gaps often do not occur in market averages that are not themselves traded. For example,
the day following Saddam Hussein’s capture on December 13, 2003, a majority of stocks opened
strongly upward on gaps, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed an opening price
roughly the same as that at the close of the previous day and then rose as the prices of the com-
ponent stocks gradually opened. No gap existed in the DJIA because it is an average, not a secu-
rity. On the other hand, the DJIA future showed a gap because it is a traded security.
Breakaway (or Breakout) Gaps
The most profitable gaps are those that occur at the beginning of a trend, called breakaway gaps.
We have seen these before when prices suddenly break through a formation boundary and a
major change in trend direction begins. Breakaway gaps signal that a pattern is completed and a
boundary penetrated. The size of the gap—the space between the two extremes in which no
activity occurs—appears to be proportional to the strength of the subsequent price move. Heavy
volume usually accompanies upward gaps but not necessarily downward gaps. The best manner
of trading breakaway gaps is to wait a short while for the initial fading or profit-taking by the
professionals to see if the gap is filled and if not, to enter in the direction of the gap with a stop at
the point where the gap would be filled. If the gap is filled immediately, a stop and reverse might
ptg
be appropriate, because a sudden failure in a gap is often followed by a large move in the oppo-
site direction from the gap direction, similar to a Specialist’s Breakout.
David Landry (2003) suggests a method of mechanizing the breakaway gap known as the
“explosion gap pivot.” A reversal point, often called a pivot, establishes not only where prices
have reversed direction but also where supply and resistance are likely to occur in the future.1 In
Landry’s method, a pivot low is the low of a bar that is surrounded on both sides by a bar with a
higher low, as shown in Figure 17.2. This establishes a reversal point. Requirements that are
more restrictive can be placed on the pivot point; for example, higher lows may be required for
two or more bars on either side of the pivot point. For Landry’s method, however, one on both
sides is sufficient.
We know that a breakaway gap can be a false gap and that if it is “filled,” the odds of it
being false increase. Thus, we want a breakaway gap to establish a new high, for at least the past
20 days, and for the subsequent retracement not to fill the gap. If either of these requirements is
not met, the gap is ignored. When the retracement does occur, eventually it will create a pivot low
above the lower edge of the gap. Once this pivot low occurs, a buy entry stop is placed above the
high of the next bar from the pivot low (the one that establishes the pivot), and a protective stop
is placed just above the gap lower edge (or Landry suggests just below the pivot low). If the gap
is then filled, the protective stop will exit the position. Occasionally, the pivot low will be pene-
trated again, but as long as the gap is not filled, the position should be kept. The reverse configu-
ration is equally applicable to downward breakaway gaps.
1. This reversal “pivot” should not be confused with the “pivot point” used in intraday trading for anticipating potential
support and resistance levels.

Opening Gap
When the opening price for the day is outside the range of the previous day, it is called an open-
ing gap. After the opening, prices might continue in the direction of the gap, and the gap
becomes a breakaway gap, or prices might retrace from the opening and fill the gap. Figure 17.3
shows an opening gap to the downside, with prices retracing and filling the gap during the day.
This type of pattern is sometimes useful in determining a short-term trend reversal. The history
of opening gaps in index futures suggests that they should be “faded” (or sold into) on large
upward openings because they most often “fill” (retrace through the price vacuum) during the
day. In downward opening gaps, a fill is not as common (Kaufman, 1998). In individual stock
issues and commodities, a fill is a sign of weakness and should not occur in a breakaway gap. If
the gap is not filled, usually within the first half hour, the odds of the trend continuing in the
direction of the gap increase.

Opening Down Gap
(Later Filled During Day)
ptg
FIGURE 17.3 Opening down gap
One way potentially to profit from an opening gap is to watch the first three five-minute
bars (a three-bar range) and determine the high and low of this range. A breakout of that range in
the direction of the gap often indicates that the trend will continue in the gap direction; a break-
out that moves in the direction of filling the gap will often continue to fill the gap. A danger is
that the first run from the gap can last longer than the three bars. The three-bar range must, there-
fore, be obvious, not a continued run in the gap direction. In addition, the breakout from the
three-bar gap range in the direction of the gap may be false. A tight stop is necessary, or a wait
for a pullback or throwback from the breakout, a narrow range bar break, or even a small cup and
handle.
If the price breaks the three-bar range in the other direction toward the fill, the previous
day’s close, the fill line, will likely be the target. A bounce between the fill line and the range

breakout line suggests that the longer-term move will be in the direction of the fill, a reversal of
the gap. On the other hand, if the prices after a range break in the direction of the fill turn and
retest the outer extreme of the three-bar range, the odds increase that the longer-term move will
be in the direction of the gap.
Runaway Gaps (or Measuring Gaps)
Gaps that occur along a trend are called runaway gaps. They can appear in strong trends that
have very few minor corrections and just keep rising or declining without retracements or other
interruptions. They are also called measuring gaps because, like pennants and flags, they often
occur at about the middle of a price run, and, thus, the initial distance to them can be projected
above them for a target price. An upward runaway gap occurs on average 43% of the distance
from the trend beginning and the eventual peak, whereas a downward gap occurs on average
57% of the distance (Bulkowski, 2010).
Exhaustion Gaps
ptg
Exhaustion gaps occur at the end of moves but are not recognized at the time because they have
the same characteristics as runaway gaps. If a gap is later closed, it is likely an exhaustion gap.
These gaps appear when a strong trend has reached a point where greed or fear has reached its
apex. Usually they represent latecomers to the trend who are anxious to jump on or jump off.
They can occur on light volume but more often occur on heavy volume.
The sign that such gaps are not runaway gaps is an immediate fill within a few bars of the
gap. Remember that a runaway gap often occurs midstream in a price run. Prices should not
immediately reverse and fill a gap unless the end of the run is approaching. Exhaustion gaps
occur at the end of a move and signal a potential trend reversal. Usually more evidence of an
exhaustion gap is necessary before an action signal can be justified. Sometimes prices reverse
immediately, and sometimes they enter a congestion area.
Other Minorr Gaps
Common gaps are those that occur frequently in illiquid trading vehicles, are small in relation to
the price of the vehicle, or appear in very short-term trading data. They are of no consequence.
Pattern gaps occasionally appear within the formation of larger patterns, and generally they are
filled. Their only significance is to suggest that a congestion area is forming. Ex-dividend gaps
sometimes occur in stock prices when the dividend is paid and the stock price is adjusted the fol-
lowing day. These have no significance and must not be misinterpreted. Often gaps occur in 24-
hour futures trading when one market closes and another opens, especially if one market is
electronic and the other open outcry. These are called suspension gaps and are also meaningless
unless they occur as one of the four principal gaps described previously.

BOX 17.1 GAPS AND CLASSIC PATTERNS—A CASE STUDY OF APPLE COMPUTER
Figure 17.4 contains daily bar charts for Apple Computer (AAPL) for September
2009 through May 2010. What actions might we have taken in this stock, given our
knowledge of classic patterns and gaps? Each paragraph number below corresponds
to the number on Figure 17.4.
1. First we see a small pennant formation with an upward breakout at $167.28.
We buy the stock on the breakout. Because we don’t have the past history, we
can’t, at this point make a measured move projection of the eventual target,
and we decide to just hold the stock with a protective stop below the pennant’s
lower bound at $164.11. Upward gap1 and gap2 appear next. We use them to
place trailing stops as the price progresses upward. The pivot low after the
gap1 is the first trailing stop at $169.70. We now have a locked-in profit even if
the stop is triggered. Gap2 is a runaway gap. A runaway gap should not retrace
back into the gap, or it is not a runaway. We, thus, raise the trailing stop to the
upper edge of the gap at $177.88. Because this is a runaway gap, we can now
project the target with the measured move method. We do this by measuring ptg
the price difference between the move beginning ($167.28) and the midpoint
in the gap ($176.77). This $9.49 we add to the gap2 midpoint to arrive at an
estimated objective of $176.77 + $9.49 = $186.25. This price is reached two
days later, at which point we can sell or hang on with a close trailing stop so as
not to lose the gain we have already achieved. If we sell at the target price, we
will have profited by $18.97, about 11.3% in nine days.
2. The price then goes into a flag pattern and when it breaks out at $187.30, we
buy it again. This breakout is accompanied by gap3, which is later filled. We
place the protective stop at the low price of the flag at $180.70.

3. Gap4 occurs and has the initial appearance of a breakout or runaway gap. In
neither case should prices fill such a gap, and so we move our stop to the upper
limit of the gap4 at $197.85
4. Our trailing stop is triggered by an unexpected price decline that negates the
earlier interpretation of gap4. We profit by $10.55.
5. The price then forms a downward flag pattern and volume confirms as it
declines with price. The break upward from the flag triggers another buy at
$190.73. This is followed by gap5, another likely runaway gap. The measured
move projection from this gap is $200.73, which is reached on the day follow-
ing gap5. We can sell at this level and reap another gain, this time of $10.00.
6. Had we not sold at the target price, we still would have placed a trailing stop at
the upper level of gap5 at $196.26 and sold the stock on the retracement. We
might also have sold the stock short on the trailing stop because the filling of
what’s thought to be a runaway gap is often an exhaustion gap and, therefore,
a price trend reversal.
7. Whether we sold the stock short or not, the upward breakout from a symmetri- ptg
cal triangle would require another entry buy at $196.05. Following that trian-
gle, breakout gap7 forms. This also has the appearance of a runaway gap
(strong price move closing near high on increased volume), and we move a
trailing stop from below the triangle to the upper edge of the gap at $203.35.
We also calculate the measured move target of $209.68, which is reached two
days later. If we sell at the target, we achieve on the trade a profit of $13.63.
8. If we don’t sell at the target, we certainly are forced to sell when the price
breaks below our trailing stop at the upper bound of gap7. This breakout is not
only through the gap but also through the lower bound of a broadening pattern.
Indeed, with this combination, we will short the stock at the breakout price of
$203.35 and place a protective stop at the upper bound of the broadening pat-
tern at $215.55. Following the breakout down, the price rallies in a pullback to
the breakdown level but fails to penetrate back through it on the upside. How-
ever, it also fails to continue downward after the pullback and instead forms a
symmetrical triangle. We place a buy stop each day along the upper bound of
the triangle as our trailing stop.
9. We get stopped out with the trailing stop at $196.60, and we buy the stock on
the basis of the triangle pattern confirmed with declining volume. We place a
protective stop at the cradle of the triangle where the two bounds meet at
$189.48 in case the breakout is false. Indeed, the price throws back shortly
after the breakout but doesn’t penetrate the cradle, and we remain long the
stock. Gap8 comes after a healthy rise in the stock price. This also has the
appearance of a runaway gap (high volume, large price move), and we move
our trailing stop to the upper bound of the gap at $219.70. The measured move
target from this runaway gap is $234.02. It is reached 18 days later.

continued
10. We could sell at the target price, but before the target is reached, a flag pattern
formed. We move our trailing stop up to the lower edge of the flag at $220.15
to protect our profit. A flag pattern is also a measured pattern that will give an
additional price target. The calculation in this instance is to take the high point
in the flag at $227.73 minus the starting price of the move ($196.60) for an
estimated price distance of $31.13 that we add to the level at which the price
breaks out of the flat ($224.64). But prices broke upward from the flag and,
thus, projected $31.13 to a target of $255.77, our new target.
11. Our price target is reached 21 trading days after the upward breakout from the
flag pattern on a large upward gap (gap10). There was a small gap9 preceding
gap10 and a few others along the way. Each of these gaps failed to show the
characteristics of a runaway gap and were, thus, ignored. But gap10, aside
from reaching our objective was substantial and also likely a runaway gap, just
because of the size of the gap compared with others. If we don’t sell at the tar-
get price, we at least move the trailing stop to the upper level of the gap at ptg
$255.73.
12. As it turns out, gap10 was an exhaustion gap, something that can only be rec-
ognized in retrospect. However, we were stopped out of our trade at the trail-
ing stop and perhaps went short on the exhaustion gap breakdown because this
type of breakdowns often indicates a trend reversal. That the exhaustion gap
occurred at the price target from the earlier flag formation confirmed the like-
lihood of a trend reversal. The sell stop produced a profit of $59.13, a 30%
gain in less than 3 months.
The preceding example shows what can be done with just technical analysis alone.
We did not act on any news or outside market behavior. We simply watched the price
very closely. Stops were an important part of our strategy. If we had not moved stops
when we did, we would have suffered at the upward breakout from the symmetrical
triangle and from the failure of gap10. Risk control is sometimes more important
than entry technique. Technical analysis takes knowledge, patience, and close watch-
ing of price action, but profits can be made.
Spike (or Wide-Range or Large-Range Bar)
Spikes are similar to gaps except that the empty space associated with a gap is a solid line (in a
bar chart). Should a breakaway gap occur intraday, for example, the daily bar would not show the
discontinuity from the gap but instead would show a long bar. The importance of a spike, as in a
gap, depends on the context surrounding it. A spike can occur on a breakout from a formation,
midpoint in a strong, accelerating trend, and as the final reversal day at the end of a trend. In the

earlier discussion of breakouts, we demonstrated the Specialist Breakout. This is often a spike
because it usually occurs intraday. At the ends of trends when either gross enthusiasm or panic
appears, the last few bars are often spikes. At the end of an accelerated trend, the last bar within
the trend is often a spike called a climax (see Figure 17.5). Thus, spikes can represent the begin-
ning or end of a trend. On the other hand, some stocks and commodities, especially those await-
ing a news announcement, will have wide-range bars that subside almost immediately within the
next few days with little net change in trend direction. This behavior is generally associated with
a stock or commodity that will not follow standard technical rules.

Dead Cat Bounce (DCB)
“Dead Cat Bounce” is a graceless term for a failed rally after a sharp decline. Although the term
has been used for many years on Wall Street and in Chicago, it was probably first used in print
either in a 1985 Financial Times article by reporter Chris Sherwell in a comment on the sharp
decline in the Singapore stock market or by Raymond Devoe Jr., research analyst and profes-
sional cynic, who advocated using a bumper sticker “Beware the Dead Cat Bounce” in 1986.

==================================================

372 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
The DCB is most profitable and more easily recognized after a large downward breakaway
gap or downward breakaway spike. The sudden downward motion is called an event decline
because it usually occurs on an event such as a bad news announcement. It lasts just a few days
(average of seven) and usually begins a longer-term downward price trend. The DCB’s character-
istics include a short rally of several days up to two weeks following the initial bottom from the
sharp initial news event sell-off. Ideally, the rally should follow an event decline of over 20%.
Normally, the larger the first decline, the higher the bounce. In Figure 17.6 of British Petroleum
during the Gulf Oil disaster, the first DCB had only a very small two-day DCB before declining
again. The second downward gap was followed by a larger DCB that also lasted 2 days, and the
third lasted 2 days. The “bounce” comes from bargain hunters and bottom-fishing traders who are
second-guessing when the actual bottom will take place. It gathers momentum from short cover-
ing and momentum signals. The buyers are usually wrong. In over 67% of DCBs (Bulkowski,
2010), the price continues to lower after the DCB and breaks the earlier news event low an aver-
age of 18%. The second decline in a DCB is characteristically less intense but equally deceiving.
It also tends to be accompanied by much lower volume. Not all event declines include a DCB.

To trade the DCB, the event decline must first be recognized. This is usually easy because
almost every day, somewhere, some bad news comes out about a company or commodity. Wait
for the initial sell-off volume to decline and then look for a rally on lesser volume, sometimes
back as far as the lower edge of the breakaway gap, and lasting only a few days. If the downward
rush occurred as a spike rather than a gap (as did BP in Figure 17.6), look into the intraday trad-
ing to see where the news event gap occurred, and use that gap just as if it had occurred between

the daily bars. In the British Petroleum chart (Figure 17.6), the rally did not fill the gap in all
DCBs. The short-selling trading requirement then is for a topping of the bounce or a short-term
top pattern, close protective stops above the entry, and a longer time horizon. For those wanting
to purchase the stock, the odds are against profiting from a purchase for at least six months. Most
bullish chart patterns fail during this period.
Island Reversal
An island reversal can occur at either a top or a bottom and only occurs after a relatively lengthy
trend. It can occur in a congestion area, but only infrequently. It requires two gaps at roughly the
same price: the first in the direction of the trend, an exhaustion gap, and the second in the reverse
direction, a breakaway gap. The British Petroleum chart shown in Figure 17.6 shows an island
reversal top within the context of a downward trend. The larger the gap, the more important is the
formation. Between the gaps, low volatility trading can occur for a number of days or even
weeks. Volume usually increases on the second gap from an island top but not necessarily from a
bottom. The extreme price in the island must be either higher than previous highs at a top or
lower than previous lows at a bottom. Pullbacks and throwbacks are frequent (65%–70%), and
failures are low, around 13%–17%. This pattern is not very common and has terrible perform- ptg
ance results (Bulkowski, 2010).
One- and Two-Bar Reversal Patterns
The following one- and two-bar reversal patterns are very common. Therefore, each of these pat-
terns needs confirmation before use.
One-Bar Reversal (Also Reversal Bar, Climax, Top or Bottom Reversal Bar, Key
Reversal Bar)
When a trading bar high is greater than the previous bar high and the close is down from the pre-
vious bar close, it is called a one-bar reversal. It is sometimes preceded by a gap, at least an
opening gap, and its bar length is not as extreme or intensive as in a spike. It is not a spike, because
a spike is not necessarily a reversal, but a combination of spike and reversal can elevate its mean-
ing. This pattern will occur in reverse at a bottom. It is very common, but unfortunately, its top and
bottom version will also occur within a trend, making it practically useless as a signal by itself. To
be useful, but also cutting down on the number of profitable signals, it needs more stringent
requirements. For example, rather than just closing down, the close may be required to exceed the
previous bar low or even the low of the two previous bars. Kamich (2003) argues that a close is
more reliable after a sustained advance than after a short rally. This may require that it be the high-
est high or lowest low over a specified period or that a series of higher highs or lower lows precede
it. When combined with a cluster of other evidence, a close’s significance improves. Whatever sig-
nal it gives is completely negated once prices exceed its reversal peak or trough.
Two-Bar Reversal (Also Pipe Formation)
The two-bar reversal pattern, like the one-bar reversal, occurs at the end of a trend, upward or
downward, but extends the reversal over two bars. Bulkowski calls it a pipe formation. A two-
bar reversal formation is pictured in Figure 17.7. In the bottom pattern, the first bar usually

closes in the lower half of the bar, and the second bar close ends near its high. Usually high vol-
ume is seen on both bars. In its extreme and more reliable version, it consists of two side-by-side
spikes, but it can also be above-average length side-by-side bars of roughly equivalent length,
peaking or bottoming at close to the same price, and occurring after a lengthy trend. Following
and prior to the two-bar reversal, low bar prices should be in the vicinity of the top of the bars (in
a bottom, the opposite for a top). It, thus, stands out quite easily in retrospect. It is preferable for
the second bar to be slightly longer than the first bar, and volume is preferably higher on the left
bar than on the right. Rarely this pattern acts as a consolidation area within a trend. Many pipes
occur at the end of the retracement of a longer-term move. The directional clue is the direction of
the breakout from it.

Failure rates are in the 5% range, which is very low for a pattern (Bulkowski, 2010). Usu-
ally the failure occurs when the previous trend has been less than 5%. If the earlier trend is
lengthy, the pattern rarely fails. Once the pattern has formed and prices have reversed direction, it
is common for a test of the bars to occur soon thereafter. In most cases, the bars hold their extreme
within a small percentage during the test, and this presents a good spot to place an initial protec-

tive stop. Both Kamich and Bulkowski maintain that the formation in weekly bars is more reliable
than in daily bars. Bulkowski ranks it 2 out of 23 for performance in a bull market.
Horn Pattern
Bulkowski describes the horn pattern as being almost identical in behavior to the pipe except a
smaller bar separates the two lengthy bars. The two long bars become the “horns” of the forma-
tion (see Figure 17.8). As in the two-bar reversal, the formation is more reliable with weekly bars
and otherwise has the same characteristics as the pipe. It is not as effective as the pipe at bottoms
and tops, and its failure rate increases when the trend preceding the pattern is short.

Two-Bar Breakout
The two-bar breakout is an extremely simple pattern. Indeed, it is so simple it is hard to believe
that it will work, but the testing column in Active Trader Magazine (November 2003) tested it
and found it to be successful for stocks and commodities (more so with commodities). The rules
they used and that could easily be experimented with are for longs: the next day buy on a stop

one tick above today’s high if (1) today’s low is less than yesterday’s low; (2) today’s high is less
than yesterday’s high, and (3) today’s close is less than today’s open. Exit on a stop at the then-
current day’s low. The sell side is just the opposite. Results should be tested against a better exit
strategy, but as it is, the pattern produced reasonable profits in commodities and an extremely
low drawdown. In stocks, the results were not as favorable but likely could be improved upon
with money management and a better exit strategy.
Inside Bar
An inside bar is a bar with a range that is smaller than and within the previous bar’s range, as
shown in Figure 17.9. It reflects a decline in momentum in a trend, a bar where a short-term con-
gestion area is formed. As in most congestion areas, it reflects a pause, a period of directionless
equilibrium waiting for something to happen that will signal the next trend direction. During a
larger congestion pattern, such as a triangle or rectangle, an inside bar has little meaning because
it is just reflecting the lack of motion in the larger pattern. Some analysts plotting larger patterns
delete inside bars, especially when determining pivots, because these bars fail to represent any
important price action, similar to how the point-and-figure chart eliminates dull periods. Within
a trend, however, the inside bar provides some useful information and can generate profitable

very short-term signals. As in the gap pattern, the context of the pattern’s location is more impor-
tant than the pattern configuration.

Chapter 17 Short-Term Patterns 377
Tony Crabel (1989) found that without a cluster of other information, a number of inside
bar combinations during the 1982–1986 period in the S&P futures achieved a better-than-aver-
age winning percentage. Crabel tested buying at the next opening, if it occurred above the inside
bar close and selling at the next opening, if it occurred below the inside bar close (see Figure
17.10). This strategy produced a 68% winning percentage. This winning percentage could then
be improved by adding even other requirements, mostly having to do with characteristics of the
bars preceding the inside bar and with the preceding trend. One strategy, for example, is to buy if
the inside bar close was higher than the previous day close and there is a higher open on the cur-
rent bar and to sell when the inside bar close was below the previous day close and the opening
on the current bar is below the inside close. For this slightly more complex strategy, a 74% win-
ning percentage occurred.

Crabel took his inside tests a little further, looking for a four-day pattern. If Day 2 had a
higher low than Day 1, Day 3 was an inside day, and if Day 4 opened lower than the midrange
and close of the inside day, a sell signal was generated. This strategy is pictured in Figure 17.11.

During Crabel’s test period, this strategy had an 80% winning percentage. The opposite strategy
would occur when Day 2 had a lower high than Day 1, Day 3 was an inside day, and Day 4
opened above the inside day close, triggering a buy signal. This strategy produced a 90% win-
ning percentage. Although these strategies had extremely high winning percentages, they only
occurred on average twice a year.

What Crabel was demonstrating, regardless of the percentages, was that the opening of a
bar after an inside bar shows a strong bias toward the new price direction. Granted, his testing
was done during a bull market in the late 1980s and is somewhat dated today, but nevertheless,
the tests showed some correlation to the inside day breakouts and future performance. His exit
criterion was to close the position on the close of the day the trade was entered. This limits such
trades to day traders. However, an inside bar can also occur on weekly bar charts and usually sig-
nifies a larger congestion area similar to a pennant or flag on a daily chart. In these cases, the
inside week can be useful for longer-term trading.
Several other common patterns use the inside bar concept.

Chapter 17 Short-Term Patterns 379
Hook Reversal Day
Hook is a common term for a quick loss when a profit was expected. It comes from the fishhook
that the fish bites thinking that the bait is a free meal. As outlined by Kamich (2003) and Crabel
(1989), a hook reversal occurs after a series of upward thrust bars, called run bars when they
occur right after each other (Schwager, 1996). Then suddenly, a narrow-range bar occurs with
specific characteristics. The narrow-range bar must open at above the previous high and close
below the previous close. Kamich’s variation is for an inside bar that opens at its high and closes
at its low. This signals that the momentum built up during the run has reached a climax. A down-
ward break would be an action signal.
Another hook formation occurs when traders are “hooked” into believing that the trend has
reversed. This occurs when an open is above the previous high, but prices reverse direction and
close down on the bar. This is the hook. It must have a narrower range than the previous bar, but
it often fools traders into believing that a top has occurred. The action signal is when the price
breaks back above the close of the first. It also works in reverse.
Naked Bar Upward Reversal
A variation of the hook, a naked bar is one that closes below a previous low (suggested by Joe
ptg
Stowell and Larry Williams) and is a down bar (close less than open). It is the most bearish close
possible. If an inside bar follows a naked bar with open greater than naked bar close, it is a sign
that the downtrend is reversing. An upward break from the inside bar would suggest the bears are
caught.
Hikkake
The hikkake is an inside bar signal that fails and become a signal itself (see Figure 17.12). As
described by Daniel Chesler (2004), in Japanese, “hikkake” is a term meaning to trap, trick, or
ensnare. It is a pattern that starts with an inside bar. When prices break one way or the other from
an inside bar, the conventional belief is that they will continue in the same direction. The hikkake
pattern occurs when the breakout fails to continue and prices in the following bars return to break
in the opposite direction through the previous inside bar extreme. The reversal and opposite
breakout must occur within three bars after the first breakout, and the open and close of each bar
seems to be unimportant.
Outside Bar
An outside bar occurs when the high is higher than the high of the previous bar and the low is
lower than the low of the previous bar. It is a specific kind of wide-range bar that “covers” all the
previous bar’s price action. In other words, the outside bar is longer than the previous bar and
contains the entire price range of the previous bar. Traditionally, an outside bar is thought of as a
bar of increased volatility, and, depending on the close, perhaps the beginning of a trend. Larry
Williams (1988, 1995, 1999, 2000, 2003) has done considerable study of outside bars, and the
results are available in his various books.

Failure (Hikkake Sell)
FIGURE 17.12 Hikkake buy failure
When an outside bar closes near an extreme—that is, a high or low—and above or below
the previous close and its current opening, it suggests further action in the direction of the close
into the following bar. Bulkowski, using daily lows observes that the close, if located within the
upper or lower 25% of the range, tends to predict the future breakout upward about 66% of the
time and downward 62% of the time. However, it often is a false signal. For example, one of the
more reliable, though less frequently seen, setup patterns with an outside day is when the outside
day closes at below the previous day’s low and the next day opens lower than the outside day
close. Buy the following day opening (Williams, 2000). Standard opinion would suggest that the
series of lower closes was bearish, yet the setup is bullish.
Multiple Bar Patterns
Trend Correction
Many studies have shown that acting in the direction of the trend is more advantageous after
waiting for a correction to that trend. The reward of catching the trend at a cheaper price as well
as having a closer stop level outweigh the potential opportunity loss of missing the trend.

Chapter 17 Short-Term Patterns 381
There are at least two different types of trend correction patterns. One is to recognize a
trend and act on a percentage pullback from that trend. Active Trader Magazine (March, 2003)
tested on 18 stocks a long-only 6% pullback system. It demonstrated during the period 1992
through 2002, a generally rising period, entering a buy at 6% below the previous bar close and
exiting on the next open would produce an excellent equity curve when triggered. The gain over
the period was the same as the buy-and-hold, but the market exposure was only 17% due to the
limited number of trades and the quick exits.
Knockout Pattern
The knockout (or KO) pattern is another trend correction method, used by David Landry (2003).
(See Figure 17.13). The first requirement for this pattern is that an extremely strong and persist-
ent trend must be present. In an upward trend, Landry’s criteria for a strong uptrend is that the
stock must have risen at least ten points in the past 20 trading days and a trend line drawn
through the prices touch almost all bars. Thus, if we think about a linear regression line, the bars
should have a small deviation from that line, not wide swings back and forth. At some time, the
stock will develop a throwback of two to five days in which two prior lows will be exceeded.
Place a buy entry stop at the high of the bar with the second low. If the next bar is lower, move
ptg
the buy stop to its high until the position is executed. Place a protective stop below the last low,
or use any reasonable stop method. According to Landry, the reverse is equally as successful in a
downtrend using the criteria in reverse. Figure 17.13 shows a steady downward trend in lumber
futures with occasional two-day rallies that fulfill the requirements of the KO pattern.

Oops!
Larry Williams (1979) coined the expression “Oops!” (see Figure 17.14). The setup for this pat-
tern occurs when the opening price on today’s bar is outside the previous day’s range. Assume,
for example, that a stock opens today at a price below yesterday’s range. A buy stop is then
placed just inside yesterday’s range in case the market closes the gap, indicating a reversal. This
pattern depends on traders acting in the direction of an opening gap and being caught when
prices reverse.

open on a downward gap. If these conditions are met, place a buy stop at the first day’s low with
a sell stop near the second day’s opening. A sell pattern is just the reverse on a day when the
close is within 10% of its high.

Shark
The shark pattern is a three-bar pattern. The most recent bar high must be lower than the previ-
ous high and the recent low above the previous low. In other words, the recent bar is an inside
bar. The previous bar must also be an inside bar. The progression in bars, therefore, is one base
bar and two successive inside bars, as shown in Figure 17.15. In effect, it is a small triangle or
pennant. The name “shark” comes from the pattern’s finlike shape.

in that Downs questioned whether the symmetry of the pattern added to or detracted from its per-
formance. Symmetry was measured by determining the amount by which the center of the final
inside day range, called the apex, deviated from the center of the base day range. Although there

can be many shark patterns, Downs limited his study to those patterns that fit a specified symme-
try. The test was run on Harley Davidson stock from July 1986 to April 1998, a period of gener-
ally rising stock prices. The entry was to buy on the close of the first day after a day in which the
close exceeded the widest point in the pattern, usually the base day. The exit was a trailing stop
or a reversal on the opposite signal.
The results of Downs’ study were useful in that they suggested that the more symmetrical
the shark formation, the more likely prices would continue in the same direction and improve
performance at least out to 30 days thereafter. As the symmetry became very tight, the results did
not change, but the number of patterns that fit into the requirements declined. One example was
that if the symmetrical variance of the apex midrange was within 12% either side of the center of
the base day range, the trend continued in the same direction as the prepattern direction 91% of
the time, strengthened in 36% of the instances, and increased in momentum 34% of the time
within 30 days.
Volatility Patterns
Most short-term patterns rely on an expansion in volatility. The inside bar strategies, for exam-
ple, are based on the notion that inside bars represent low volatility and that when prices break ptg
one way or another, volatility expands. To take this concept of volatility further, many patterns
look directly at volatility itself—either historical volatility as defined in the option markets,
changes in trading ranges, or indicators such as the ADX. An expansion in volatility is used as a
signal for action in most patterns, but sometimes a contrary action is suggested when volatility
becomes extreme. Following are examples of some of these patterns.
Wide-Range Bar
A wide-range bar is a bar in which the range is “considerably” wider than the normal bar. The
bars are relatively long compared with the previous bar. How large does the range have to be to
be considered “wide,” and how far back must the comparison be made? There are no definitive
answers to these questions and, therefore, there is no specific definition of a wide-range bar other
than its range is “considerably” wider than the normal bar. In any case, a wide-range bar is usu-
ally a bar with increased volatility. Increased volatility can imply the beginning of a new trend as
in a breakout bar, or if the trend has been in existence for a long time and is accelerating, the
wide-range bar may act like an exhaustion gap and warn of the trend’s end. As a sign of impend-
ing trend reversal, it is more often seen at panic lows, as the emotions of fear accelerate prices
downward. Emotional spikes and two-bar reversals are often wide-range bars. Otherwise, it is
usually found on a breakout from a pattern, small or large, or as the base for a pennant or flag,
indicating that the trend reached a very short-term peak and is about to consolidate. On the other
hand, not all wide-range bars are meaningful. Consideration of trend, as always, areas of support
and resistance, patterns, and the relative location of opens and closes are necessary before a judg-
ment of the significance of the wide-range bar can be determined.
Larry Connors (1998) gives an example of a wide-range pattern. Connors first looks for a
wide-range day in which a stock experiences a two-standard deviation decline. On the following
day, if the opening is a downward gap, place a buy entry stop at the first day’s close with a

protection stop at the first day’s low. If the buy is near the previous day’s low, then lower the stop
to give some room for the pattern to develop. The reverse set of signals is valid on the sell side at
a top. The exit is to sell on the close, or if the close on the action day is within 10% to 15% of the
high sell on the next day opening.
Narrow-Range Bar (NR)
Wide-range bars indicate high volatility; narrow-range bars indicate low volatility (see Figure
17.16). Determining narrow-range bars is useful because the low volatility will eventually switch
to high volatility. As with the wide-range bar, the criteria for determining a narrow-range bar are
not precise.

386 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
Tony Crabel designed one method of defining and using narrow-range days. In his method,
he determines whether the current day has a narrower range than the previous day and if so, over
how many past days. For example, if the current day has a narrower range than the past three
days, it is called an NR4 day (to include the current day and the past three days); in other words,
the current day represents the narrowest trading range of the four days. The common narrow
days of this type are the NR4 and NR7 day. Their entry signal is a breakout from the most recent
narrow-range day. Thus, if today is an NR7 day, we place a buy and sell entry stop on either side
to be acted upon tomorrow or the next day.
Linda Bradford Raschke (www.lbrgroup.com) is one of the leading proponents of using
narrow-range days to determine low-volatility setups. Raschke adds another constraint to Cra-
bel’s method. She calculates the historic volatility of the vehicle over 6 days and over 100 days.
If the 6-day historic volatility is 50% less than the 100-day, the conditions are right for either an
NR4 day or inside day signal, provided today meets the criteria for each of these types of days.
The buy and sell entry stops are placed at the high and low of the qualified NR4 or inside day. If
the entry stop is executed, an additional exit stop is placed where the opposite entry stop cur-
rently exists. Exit the position at the close of the day if not already stopped out.
VIX ptg
In our discussion of sentiment indicators in Chapter 7, “Sentiment,” we introduced the VIX, a
measure of implied volatility in the S&P 500 options. Remember that the VIX is a reflection of
anxiousness in the market. Traders and investors become anxious when the market declines and
become complacent when the market advances. Thus, VIX becomes a sentiment indicator. Gen-
erally, when the market is bottoming, VIX is high, because of the investor anxiousness. When the
market is topping, VIX is generally low, indicating the complacency among investors.
Larry Connors (1998) introduced a number of short-term price patterns that were based on
the behavior of the VIX. The principle behind these patterns was to watch for changes in VIX, as
a measure of sentiment, at extremes, as for example, either after X number of days or combining
with an oscillator formula to determine when VIX is overbought or oversold. A more general
strategy for the VIX was to look at the deviation from a moving average (Connors, 2004). VIX
has changed levels over the past decade, but a moving average dampens those changes. Connors
used a 5% deviation from a 10-day simple moving average. If the VIX is below the SMA by 5%
and the market is above its 200-day moving average, the odds favor a continuing upward trend
but not necessarily a good time to buy except on throwbacks. When the ratio is above 5%, and
even more so when it is above 10% of the SMA, the time is usually excellent to buy. Thus, the
VIX in this instance gives general zones of when action in certain directions can be contem-
plated. The opposite relationship is valid when the market is below its 200-day moving average.
Generally, bottoms are more reliably signaled by the VIX than tops.
Intraday Patterns
The opening range is the range of a daily bar that forms in the first few minutes or hour of the
trading day (see Figure 17.17). It can be defined as either the high and low after a certain time,

such as the high and low price that occur during the first 15 minutes of trading, or it can be a pre-
determined range about the opening price. A horizontal line is drawn at the opening range high
and low on the intraday bar chart as a reference for the rest of the day. Other lines from the open-
ing price, the close yesterday, the range yesterday, and so forth may also be drawn. These lines
often become support or resistance levels during the day.

388 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
The opening range breakout (ORB) is a popular method of entering a position once a setup
has been established from a previous short-term pattern. As reported in Stocks & Commodities
Magazine, Tony Crabel experimented with NR days as setups and used an ORB defined by a
specified, predetermined amount above or below the opening range. He compared these results
with using a wide-range day setup. He found, first, that the wide-range day setup over both four
and seven days vastly underperformed the NR days over the same period, thus confirming that
more profit can be obtained from an expansion in volatility than contraction. Second, he found
that once the price had moved away from the open in one direction after a NR2, it normally did
not return to the opening.
In a series of articles for Stocks & Commodities Magazine, Crabel describes methods of
trading from an ORB in considerable detail. In the first article, he described how he calculates
the specified amount, called the “stretch,” above and below the opening that establishes the ORB.
Crabel uses the ten-day average of the past differences between the open for each day and its
closest extreme to the open for that day. Analysts use a number of other methods for calculating
stretch, including specifying a number of ticks or calculating a range based on the ATR over
some past period.
Crabel found that the use of ORBs worked well with NR4, NR7, inside days, and hook
days. He found that the earlier in the day the ORB was penetrated, the better the chance for suc- ptg
cess. Even without the previously mentioned setups, trading on the ORB within the first five to
ten minutes would also work, but after that short interval, if the prices have not penetrated out of
the range, all orders should be canceled because the day will likely revert to a listless trading day
rather than a trending day.
By analyzing the action around opening range levels, a good trader can find ways to take
advantage of the tendency for these levels to act as support and resistance. One method of
accomplishing this is called the “ACD method,” developed by Mark Fisher (2002). This some-
what complicated method uses the opening range determined over the initial minutes of trading,
an additional filter that is added to the upper bound of the range, and another subtracted from the
lower edge, as shown in Figure 17.18. Entry signals occur when the outer bounds are broken dur-
ing the day, and exit signals occur when the range bounds are broken. Fisher’s method is not
quite this simple because he uses numerous other rules and confirmations. However, Fisher, who
reportedly has a trading room of over 75 day traders using this method to make their daily bread,
has appeared to be very successful.

SUMMARY OF SHORT-TERM PATTERNS
Although there appears to be value in short-term patterns, they are not immediate sources of
wealth without study, experience, and trial-and-error testing. We have only touched the edge of
methods being used. Others include performance around national holidays, days of the week,
time during the day, and even the new moon. There seems to be no limit. The point in this exer-
cise, however, is to demonstrate the many ways that prices are analyzed over the short term. If
interested, you can continue to experiment on your own.

390 Part IV Chart Pattern Analysis
CANDLESTICK PATTERNS
In Chapter 11, “History and Construction of Charts,” we learned how to construct a candlestick
chart. As you will recall, the raw data used in the candlestick chart is the same as the raw data
used in the bar chart: open, close, high, and low price per specific period.
The candlestick chart has become popular because it represents price action in a more
striking way, and furthermore, the patterns that result have interesting and novel names. One
advantage of the candlestick chart is that it can still use the Western methods of analysis—pat-
terns, trend lines, support, and resistance—yet it has a set of unique patterns of its own. These
patterns are mostly short term of only one to five bars, and by themselves have not tested very
well. Many patterns have their Western equivalents that we have seen before. They are generally
reversal patterns and can reveal price reversals early in overbought or oversold conditions, at
trend lines, or at support or resistance levels. However, they are tools, not a system. Their disad-
vantage is that one must wait for the close before a pattern can be recognized, and they are use-
less in markets that do not accurately report the opening prices. The best resource on candlesticks
is Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques by Steve Nison (2001), the person who introduced
this ancient method to the West.
ptg
The principal analytical difference between candlestick patterns and Western bar patterns
is the emphasis on the opening and close. Western traders have recognized the importance of the
opening and close, but bar charts treat them without special weighting. In candlestick charts, the
“real body” is the wider area between the open and close. The “shadow” is the vertical line from
the real body up to the price high and down to the price low. A long shadow indicates the inabil-
ity for prices to maintain their highs or lows and is, thus, a warning of trouble. The real body is a
heavy color, such as black, when the close is lower than the open, and usually white when the
close is higher than the open. A black body denotes, therefore, a “down” day, and a white body
indicates an “up” day. (This definition is different than in the West, where a down day is a day in
which the close is lower than the previous close.) A large body (in relative terms) indicates
strength in the direction of the trend, and a small body indicates indecision and a potential rever-
sal, especially after a meaningful prior trend.
Patterns are made by the relative position of the body and the shadow, the location of the
candlestick in relation to its neighbors, and the confirmation the next day. Because candlestick
patterns usually are defined as top or bottom patterns, the analyst must be sure that the preceding
price action is in a trend, either up or down. A single pattern may or may not be meaningful
depending on the direction of the previous trend. Similar to Western short-term patterns, a can-
dlestick pattern cannot predict the extent of the subsequent move or the significance of the pat-
tern—that is, whether it occurs at a major or minor reversal. Thus, the pattern should always be
used with other evidence before action is taken. Being more often a reversal pattern, however,
candlestick patterns are often useful in determining support and resistance levels on their own. At
first, the analysis of these patterns seems to be filled with an endless set of rules and names, but
as you become more familiar with the nomenclature, you will see that the basis of these patterns
is not much different from the basis for Western short-term patterns.

Chapter 17 Short-Term Patterns 391
There have been few tests on the effectiveness of candlestick patterns. This is odd because
the patterns are easily computerized. As with tests of other short-term patterns, many of the exist-
ing studies are flawed in that the signal outcomes are often assumed to last longer than they
should. Measuring the effectiveness of patterns over weeks or months is useless because these
patterns are only useful in short-term situations. However, even over shorter periods, the patterns
do not test well. Their profit factors are relatively low, and their drawdowns are high and in all
cases greater than net profits. Some of the variables in each pattern can be tweaked to improve
performance, but the basic patterns, by themselves, are not outstandingly profitable.
Two relatively recent studies with short-term results are by Caginalp and Laurent (1998)
and by Schwager (1996). The Caginalp and Laurent tests included eight three-day patterns in
S&P 500 stocks from 1992 to 1996. Their purpose was to demonstrate that the patterns had value
above what could be expected from a random walk; however, drawdowns were not considered.
Schwager tested six major patterns in ten commodities from 1990 to 1994 and included a
momentum filter to account for trend, an important factor in candlestick pattern analysis. A crit-
icism, however, is that Schwager estimated commissions and slippage to be $100 per trade, con-
siderably higher than what can be achieved now. Both studies suffer from the type of exit method
in that they depend on a holding period that is arbitrary and not based on the behavior of prices.
The results could be considerably improved with testing of each pattern in combination with oth- ptg
ers and the use of protective stops. At least stops and other exit signals would reduce the
extremely large drawdowns. In our presentation of the patterns covered by Schwager, we average
the results from the ten commodities for each pattern and give the relative ranking rather than the
raw percentages. This avoids, to some extent, the problem of commissions and slippage.
Following are some examples of the more common candlestick patterns.
One- and Two-Bar Candlestick Patterns
Candlestick patterns are short-term patterns. In fact, a number of candlestick patterns are formed
by only one or two bars. Thus, on a candlestick chart of daily data, only one or two days’ worth
of data would be necessary to form the pattern.
Doji
A doji pattern is formed when the open and close are identical, or nearly identical. This creates a
candlestick with a real body that is simply a horizontal line, as shown in Figure 17.19. It suggests
that the market is in equilibrium and affected by indecision. In some respects, it is like an inside
bar in its meaning because in a trend it shows a point at which the enthusiasm of the trend has
stalled. It is, thus, often a warning of a reversal, but not necessarily a reversal pattern by itself. It
can also occur about anywhere during a trend or within a trading range and is, thus, difficult to
assess. As a result, its performance statistics were low (Schwager, 1996). It ranked at the bottom
of our scale based on net profit, average trade, maximum drawdown, and percent winners.

Windows
Windows are simply the gaps that we discussed earlier in this chapter. Nison believes they are the
most reliable formations, and evidence from short-term bar patterns tends to confirm his opinion.
Because the interpretation of candlestick windows is the same as for Western gaps, we will not
spend time discussing them.
Harami
A harami pattern is a two-day pattern consisting of a large body of either color followed by a
small body of either color that is completely within the boundaries of the large body. The harami
pattern is pictured in Figure 17.20. The second candlestick pictured in the harami pattern in Fig-
ure 17.20 is called a spinning top. This second candlestick can also be a doji (resulting in a
harami cross pattern), a hammer, a hanging man, or a shooting star; the only requirement is that
the second candlestick body is within the first candlestick body.
The harami pattern is very similar to the inside bar pattern; however, with the harami, the
range, or wick, of the second bar does not have to be within the range of the first bar. The real

body of the second candle must be within the real body of the first candle. Thus, the open and
close range, rather than the range, determines whether the harami criterion is met.
We know that the inside day demonstrates a contraction in volatility, and the same can be
said for the harami pattern. We also know from studies of short-term bar patterns that low volatil-
ity turns into high volatility and often begins a new trend. Thus, a harami pattern can be a power-
ful way of signaling either the reversal of a trend or an increase in velocity of the current trend,
depending on which direction prices break.

Hammer and Hanging Man
Both the hammer and the hanging man are candlesticks in which the real body is located at the
upper end of the trading range, as pictured in Figure 17.21. For these formations, the lower wick
is at least twice to three times as long as the body, and the upper wick is small or nonexistent. In
other words, the open and close both occur within approximately the top one-third of the bar’s
trading range, and either the open or close is, or nearly is, the highest price of the bar. The color
of the body is irrelevant.
If this formation occurs at a peak, it is called a “hanging man.” A variation is called the
“kasakasa” or “paper umbrella” when the body is shorter than the shadow. When the same for-
mation occurs at a trough, it is called a “hammer.” These formations ranked best in our scale and
were close to a tie with morning and evening stars.

Shooting Star and Inverted Hammer
The shooting star and the inverted hammer can be thought of as an upside down hanging man or
hammer. For these formations, the real body occurs in the lower end of the trading range. A
shooting star occurs at peaks, and the inverted hammer occurs at bottoms. Both have long shad-
ows above their bodies and very short or nonexistent shadows below their bodies, as shown in
Figure 17.22. Again, the color of the body is irrelevant. In our ranking of patterns, they fell into
the middle, nowhere near the best-performing hammer and hanging man to which they are
related.
Engulfing
An engulfing pattern is a two-bar pattern in which the second body engulfs the first body (see
Figure 17.23). This pattern is similar to an outside day reversal in bar patterns. Because this pat-
tern is designed to recognize a trend reversal, there must be a clear trend preceding the engulfing
pattern. In a market uptrend, a bearish engulfing pattern would indicate a market top. The bear-
ish engulfing pattern consists of a small white-bodied candle followed by a black body that
engulfs the white body. The bullish engulfing pattern would indicate that a downward trend is

reversing. This bullish engulfing pattern consists of a candle with a small dark body on one bar
followed by a candle with a larger white body that engulfs the dark body. For both the bearish
and bullish engulfing pattern, the signal is much stronger when the first body is very small and
the second body is very large. However, performance of engulfing patterns is near the bottom of
the six pattern types tested by Schwager. They had the worst net profits and the largest maximum
drawdowns.

Dark Cloud Cover and Piercing Line
A dark cloud cover is a two-body pattern at a top. The first body is large and white, and the sec-
ond body is large and dark. The second open should be above the upper shadow of the first bar,
an opening gap upward, and the close well within the first bar’s white body, preferably below the
50% level. The pattern resembles the Oops! pattern in bar charts. Performance of this pattern is
supposedly enhanced by a deeper penetration of the white body. (A complete penetration would
be an engulfing pattern.)

of the six types followed. They had the second to least drawdown, lowest average profit per
trade, and the lowest winning percentage.
Multiple Bar Patterns
Multiple bar candlestick patterns develop over a time period of more than two bars. A quick
glance at names such as “three black crows,” “three white soldiers,” and “three outside up”
reveals that many of the multiple bar patterns are three bar patterns.

Morning and Evening Star
The evening star is a three-bar candlestick pattern that occurs at market tops, and the morning
star is a three-bar, market bottom pattern. In each of these patterns, the second bar, or middle can-
dlestick, is known as a star. A star is a candlestick that has a small body that lies outside of the
range of the body before it. It implies an opening gap, as does a dark cloud and piercing line pat-
tern, but it can later cover part of the previous bar’s shadow. The important point is that its body
does not overlap the previous bar’s body at all. It is similar to a doji in that it represents a sudden
halt in a trend and some indecision between buyers and sellers. Indeed, a doji can be a star, called
a doji star, if the doji body occurs outside the body of the previous bar’s body.
The evening star pattern, pictured in Figure 17.25, starts with a long white body followed
by a star of either color. If the third bar forms a large black body that closes well within the body
of the first bar, the pattern is confirmed. Ideally, the third body should not touch the star’s body,
but this rarely occurs, and it is not a necessary condition for the pattern. The amount of penetra-
tion into the first white body is more important. The evening star is similar to the island reversal
bar pattern without the necessary second gap.

The morning star, which occurs at a market bottom, is the opposite formation of the
evening star. As shown in Figure 17.25, it begins with a black-bodied candlestick, followed by a
star. The body of the star lies completely below the body of the previous candlestick. The pattern
is then confirmed if, on the third bar, a white-bodied candlestick closes well within the range of
the first candlestick.
The morning and evening stars were the second-best patterns in our ranking of Schwager’s
tests. They were first in net profits, had the least drawdowns, and were second in the percentage
of winning trades. In the Caginalp and Laurent study, the morning and evening star pattern
ranked third out of the four multibar types studied.
Three Black Crows and Three White Soldiers
White soldiers are white bodies and black crows are black bodies. Three black crows is a pattern
with three consecutive black bodies, preferably long, closing near their lows, openings within
their previous day’s body, and occurring after a meaningful upward trend. They are a top-rever-
sal formation. As shown in Figure 17.26, three white soldiers is a bottom-reversing formation
and requires the same parameters in the opposite direction.
Unfortunately, traders have difficulty profiting from these patterns because by the time
they are recognized, a large portion of the new trend has already occurred. They are best played
on a pullback or throwback. Nison believes that the first or second bar in the pattern is the best

Three Inside Up and Three Inside Down
The three inside up pattern is a reversal pattern that occurs at the end of a declining trend. The
first bar of this pattern has a large black body, and the second bar is a white spinning top (or doji)
that forms a harami pattern. Then, the third bar is a large, white candle that breaks and closes
above the large black body of the first bar. Although the name may sound like it, the three inside
up pattern does not imply that three inside bars in a row occur, as we saw with the NR3 pattern.
Instead, the three inside up pattern is similar to an upward breakout from an inside bar in a bar
pattern.
As shown in Figure 17.27, the three inside down pattern is the reverse of the three inside
up pattern. The three inside down pattern consists of a large white bar followed by a black spin-
ning top and a downward break by a large black body. This pattern signals that an upward trend
has ended. From the Caginalp and Laurent study, we ranked this pattern type the best. It had the
highest percentage of winning trades of the four pattern types studied.

Three Outside Up and Three Outside Down
This pattern type starts with an engulfing pattern after a trend, just as the inside up and down
started with a harami pattern. The three outside up version occurs at market bottoms. The first
body is small, a spinning top, and the second body is large, engulfing the smaller previous body.
The first is black and the second is white. A white body that closes above the second bar and
reaches a new high above the previous two bars follows the engulfing pattern. This pattern is pic-
tured in Figure 17.28.
Figure 17.28 also shows how the three outside down pattern is the same with opposite
parameters. For the outside down pattern, the first bar is a small, white body, and the second bar
is a black body that engulfs the first. The third bar is also a black body with prices moving lower
than the second bar. Outside down bars occur at market tops.
From our look at short-term bar patterns, we know that outside bars are less predictable
and less profitable than inside bars because the volatility has already expanded and is open to
contraction at any time soon thereafter. The results of the three outside bar pattern types show the
same decreased performance and were ranked fourth in our interpretation of the Caginalp and
Laurent study.

CONCLUSION
We have looked at a number of short-term patterns in this chapter on both bar charts and candle-
stick charts. To use these patterns successfully, a trader must be familiar with the underlying mar-
ket trend. Remember that these short-term patterns are most often reversal patterns, giving the
trader a hint that the underlying trend may be changing.
Short-term patterns forming as open, high, low, and close prices occur in particular combi- ptg
nations during a bar or over a few bars of trading. Particular short-term patterns occur frequently.
Because of the frequency with which they occur, many times they are false patterns. Traders
must be aware of this and not simply rely on a particular short-term pattern to make decisions.
These short-term patterns can be useful indicators, but traders need to watch for a cluster of evi-
dence instead of relying on a short-term pattern to make decisions.
Remember that the key to making money is riding a trend. Short-term patterns are a tool to
help us determine when a new trend is beginning. These formations can also help us determine
when a trend is ending. This allows us to participate in the trend as soon as possible and to exit
the market as quickly as possible whenever the trend has ended. Using short-term patterns and
protective stops can aid traders in maximizing their gains and minimizing their risk.

terns?
2. Explain what is meant by the term gap. How do breakout, runaway, and exhaustion gaps
differ from each other? How would an analyst distinguish between these three types of
gaps?

ONFIRMATION
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with
• The methods of plotting volume information on charts ptg
• Traditional general rules for interpreting volume statistics
• The major indexes and oscillators that are designed to use volume information as
confirmation
• The concept of open interest and how it might be used for confirmation
• The concept of momentum
• The major indexes and oscillators that use price data
The odds increase that a technical signal is correct if there is confirmation from another unrelated
indicator. Charles Dow recognized this concept and used the confirmation of two different price
averages before he recognized a legitimate market signal. In the days when only chart patterns
were available as a means of interpreting price action, the technical analyst often used volume as
the confirming indicator. Sometimes, depending on the calculating ability of the analyst, moving
averages, rates of change, and momentum price oscillators were also used. After the introduction
of the computer, the ability to calculate more complicated indicators increased. Many analysts
began to use more complicated indicators as the primary source of signals and deviated from the
old price pattern analysis. The number of possible combinations of prices, volume, and other fac-
tors has become almost infinite. Indeed, there is some question as to whether all this computing
power has increased the ability of technical analysts to interpret price action. Some would argue
that most of the indicator calculations correlate with each other, and that the market is no more
understandable today than it was 50 years ago. Others maintain that the proper use of confirming
indicators helps considerably in decision making, and that many successful trading models
depend almost exclusively on these complex calculations.

408 Part V Trend Confirmation
In this chapter, we look at volume, the oldest confirming indicator, but which has devel-
oped some problems recently from the increase in program trading and other mechanical trading
systems. We look at open interest in the futures markets, and then we look at price oscillators,
indicators, and the discouraging evidence for their reliability in giving stand-alone signals.
ANALYSIS METHODS
The methods for analyzing confirmation rely on two main tools: indexes and oscillators. Indexes
are similar to the breadth line described in the market indicators discussion in Chapter 8, “Mea-
suring Market Strength.” They are cumulative sums of data, usually some variation of volume
and price, that continuously measure supply and demand over time rather than over a specific
period. They do not have an upper or lower bound and are plotted with price charts where they
can be compared with price action. The level of the index is irrelevant. What is relevant is the
trend of the index relative to the price trend. The only useful indexes are those that begin to
change direction before prices, signaling a change in trend. The analyst, thus, compares the
prices with the index, looking for divergences between highs and lows in each. Although indexes
can also be used with trend line, channel, and occasionally pattern analysis, their most important
ptg
use is that of divergence analysis in trending markets.
Oscillators, on the other hand, are often bounded and limited to a specified past period. As
shown in Figure 18.1, they tend to oscillate within these bounds and demonstrate when volume
or prices are relatively high or low. These indicators show the relative changes rather than the
absolute changes demonstrated in indexes and are also amenable to divergence, trend line, and
pattern analysis. Oscillators are used more successfully in trading range markets.
As with many technical indicators, research has not shown that indexes and oscillators are
profitable on their own. The student must judge after thorough testing and experience whether to
use them as secondary indicators to price analysis.
Various visual techniques have been developed to determine some meaning from these
indexes and oscillators. They are divided into methods that are peculiar to indicators, such as
divergences, and those that are just an extension of classical chart pattern analysis such as trend
lines and support and resistance. The principal methods unique to indicators are discussed in the
following sections.
Overbought/Oversold
Oscillators can be bounded or unbounded. Bounded means that the oscillator swings back and
forth within certain bounds or limits. These limits are the extremes to which the oscillator can
reach. In most bounded and in some unbounded oscillators, a zone is chosen to represent the
range near the extreme bounds. The oscillator might not reach the actual extreme bound, but
might come close and by doing so have the same implications. The zone then is the range that is
close enough to the extreme bound to be important. The upper zone is called overbought and the
lower zone is called oversold. When a security has risen far enough that its oscillator reaches the
overbought zone, it is said to be overbought, and when the price has fallen far enough that the
oscillator reaches the oversold zone, it is said to be oversold.

FIGURE 18.1 Example of oscillator analysis methods
In a trading range, the overbought and oversold levels are excellent indications of potential
reversal levels, especially when the oscillator breaks out from the zone. The zones, however, can
be deceiving in a trending market because the oscillator will remain in them during the period of
the trend, and, thus, many breakouts from the zone will be false signals. In the following descrip-
tion of oscillators, we point out the conventional zone levels, but as always, the analyst must test
for those most appropriate to the time and security being traded.
Failure Swings
A failure swing is a specific type of breakout from an overbought or oversold zone first
described by Wilder (1978). A stronger version of the breakout, it often is the first sign of a
potential reversal after a lengthy trend in which an oscillator has remained within or close to a
zone. A negative failure swing is shown in Figure 18.1; it occurs when the oscillator breaks
down out of an overbought zone, creates a reversal point, pulls back but fails to reenter the zone,
and then breaks back down below the earlier reversal point. A positive failure swing is the oppo-
site at an oversold zone.
Divergences
Although Wilder is also credited with discovering divergences, the concept is at least as old as
Dow Theory. The basic concept is that to ensure a trend has begun or is still strong, all methods
must be confirming the trend. If one index, for example, is breaking out upward but other indexes
are not, the indexes are said to be diverging; in other words, they are not acting in concert with

each other. A legitimate, strong trend, however, should have all indexes acting in concert. A
divergence is, thus, considered to be a sign, especially after a trend has been in existence for a
while, that the trend is slowing down and preparing to reverse. We saw breadth divergences in
Chapter 8 and how important and reliable they have been. This is the same concept applied to
oscillators and price charts.
The basic rule is that when a price reaches a new high, the oscillator should also reach a
new high. Of course, this is subject to some interpretation, namely “what high is a new one?” but
generally the relative highs should take place at the same time. A high on day 4 and another on
day 20 should appear in both the price and the oscillator. If the price high on day 20 is higher
than the high on day 4 but the oscillator high on day 20 is not higher than on day 4, the pattern is
called a negative divergence. An example of negative divergence is shown in Figure 18.1. A
positive divergence occurs at a series of price lows when the price reaches a new low uncon-
firmed by a new low in the oscillator. In a particularly strong trend, several divergences can occur
and, of course, if the oscillator is bounded, it will occur more often because there is little room
for the oscillator to keep making new highs or lows. This is why the first negative breadth diver-
gence is often a false signal, but when two occur, back-to-back, the oscillator breakdown signal
is more meaningful.
ptg
Reversals
Brown (1999) describes a variation of divergences known as oscillator reversals in detail. Like
divergences, reversals have been used by technicians since oscillators were first used, but they
have been popularized recently by Andrew Cardwell. A reversal differs from a divergence in that
price leads the change instead of the oscillator. For example, a negative reversal occurs when,
on day 20 the oscillator reaches a new high above that of day 4 but the price does not. As illus-
trated in Figure 18.1, it is sort of a divergence in reverse in that the price is showing weakness
when the oscillator is not as opposed to the divergence when the price is still strong but the oscil-
lator is not. Nevertheless, in keeping with the concept of confirmation, the two factors, price and
oscillator, are not in sync and are, thus, no longer confirming the trend. A positive reversal is the
same as the negative only at low bars. A reversal has the same implications as a divergence,
namely that the trend is beginning to show signs of stress and potential reversal.
Trend ID
Brown (1999) also describes what she calls “trend id.” In a trending market, oscillators will
remain in one half of their range for long periods and breakout signals from the standard over-
bought and oversold zones are often false. For example, when a price is trending upward, the
oscillator can remain at or close to the overbought zone and never reach the oversold zone to give
a signal during corrections. Brown suggests that the zones should be redefined with the zone
parameters raised to include those corrections at a slightly higher level. Her work centers around
what is called the “RSI,” a bounded oscillator that we look at later, that traditionally has an over-
sold zone below 30 and an overbought zone above 70. In a strongly upward trending market, the
price corrections at which opportune trades might occur are never reached by the oscillator.

Chapter 18 Confirmation 411
Thus, she suggests that during the rising trend, the oversold zone be raised to 40 and the over-
bought zone be raised to 90. Better signals then occur using these new levels as long as the
underlying trend remains strong. In a downward trend, the zone levels can also be adjusted
downward for the same reason. This adjustment of zones has no effect on divergences or rever-
sals or any of the other chart patterns that might suggest an upcoming trend change. The analyst,
however, must test for the best zones to fit the trend.
A variation of trend id that is commonly used is the standard deviation of the oscillator,
similar to the use of standard deviation in Bollinger Bands. The oscillator is calculated and two
bands, upper and lower, surround its plot at the level of some multiple, usually one, of the oscil-
lator’s standard deviation. This gives a “moving” overbought and oversold that trend with the
oscillator and adjust to changes in the oscillator’s volatility. Signals are generated when the oscil-
lator breaks out of the overbought or oversold zone toward the center just as with the classic
zones.
Crossovers
Crossovers occur when the oscillator crosses over either a particular level or another oscillator.
One level that is often important is the middle value, usually either zero or one that bisects the
range of the oscillator’s travels. Almost by definition, when an oscillator reaches and remains ptg
above or below the midpoint in the oscillator range, it is defining the underlying trend. It is, thus,
a potential trend indicator. Other oscillators have their raw figures smoothed through a moving
average, and crossovers occur when the raw figure crosses over the moving average. These
crossovers can either be signals to act or indications of trend change.
Classic Patterns
Strangely, oscillators and indicators often make simple patterns, such as triangles and rectangles,
and produce support and resistance levels just as does price, and even have trends that can be
defined by a classic trend line. These patterns have the same validity as price patterns, even when
the oscillator is bounded, and can be additional evidence of trend change or short-term opportu-
nity.
VOLUME CONFIRMATION
Volume is the classic confirming indicator. Volume measures are often portrayed on stock charts,
and volume statistics are incorporated in a number of indexes and oscillators.
What Is Volume?
Volume is the number of shares or contracts traded over a specified period, usually a day, but can
be one trade (called tick volume) to months or years, in any trading market—stocks, futures, and
options.

412 Part V Trend Confirmation
In markets where considerable arbitrage exists, volume statistics can sometimes be mis-
leading. For example, arbitrage between two differently dated commodity contracts can cause
volume figures in each to be distorted due to the arbitrage and not the price trend. This arbitrage
problem in volume statistics is particularly troublesome in the stock market where there is not
only arbitrage against index futures markets, but also arbitrage between baskets, ETFs, and
options. This arbitrage is known as “program trading,” and as of 2010, it accounted for approxi-
mately 25%–50% of all traded volume on the New York Stock Exchange each day. In the heav-
ily traded stocks included in averages and widely owned by institutions, large levels of volume
may thus be due simply to arbitrage trades and not the trend direction or strength. Any analyst
using these volume figures for these actively traded stocks must be aware of this potential prob-
lem in analysis.
Indeed, one criticism of program trading voiced by professional traders is that it dis-
torts the information typically provided by trading volume. As our analysis here sug-
gests, introducing trading volume unrelated to the underlying information structure
would surely weaken the ability of uninformed traders to interpret market informa-
tion accurately. (Blume, Easley, and O’Hara, 1994, p. 178)
ptg
How Is Volume Portrayed?
Analysts display volume on a price chart in many ways. Some analysts like to see the volume sta-
tistics separately from the price statistics. Others have developed means of integrating volume
data into the price chart.
Bar/Candle
The most common portrayal of volume is a vertical bar representing the total amount of volume
for that period at the bottom of the price chart. A chart showing daily price data, for example,
would show the volume for each day in a vertical bar below the price bar. Figure 18.2 shows vol-
ume statistics for Apple Computer using this method. This method is simple and assumes no
direct relationship between price and volume. It just displays the data.
Equivolume
Many attempts have been made to integrate volume directly into a bar chart. Gartley (1935) men-
tions how traders before 1900 would record on a chart a vertical bar for every 100 shares traded
at a certain price. For example, if 300 shares traded at a certain price, traders would record three
bars at that price. A wide number of bars at a certain price showed that the majority of activity
took place at that price. From this chart, traders could determine the price at which supply and
demand were equalized and, thus, the support and resistance zones.
The first published service using a combination of price and volume was the Trendograph
service by Edward S. Quinn (Bollinger, 2002; Gartley, 1935). Quinn produced charts using a bar
for the high and low each day separated by a horizontal distance based on volume traded during
the day. More recently, Richard W. Arms, Jr. (1998) designed, utilized, and reported “Equivol-
ume” charts. These are available in some of the current charting software programs.

FIGURE 18.2 Price and volume (AAPL daily: May 10, 2010–July 21, 2010)
Arms’ method widens the vertical price bar into a rectangle and, thus, widens the horizon-
tal axis in proportion to the volume traded during the same period. For an example of an Equiv-
olume shape, see Figure 18.3. The Equivolume chart resembles a regular bar chart except that the
bars vary in width. Thus, wide bars portray large volume, and thin rectangles portray thin vol-
ume. The horizontal axis of the entire chart adjusts accordingly.
Arms first interpreted the Equivolume charts by considering the rectangular shapes dis-
playing the price range by the height of the rectangle and volume by the width. For example,
after a strong upward trend, the formation of a box shape or flat rectangle suggested little price
motion but heavy volume. This would indicate that the trend was meeting some heavy resistance.
Arms also found that the standard patterns used in bar chart analysis also occur in Equivolume
charts, and interestingly, trend lines and channel lines appeared to work as well. One would think
that a trend line was totally price- and time-related in a bar chart, but Arms demonstrated that
trend lines in price-to-volume also occur.
More recently, with the introduction of picturesque candlestick charts, some services have
adopted the principles of Equivolume to include open, close, shadows, colors, and indications of
direction. (An example is the charts used in www.incrediblecharts.com.) These charts have the
same rectangular appearance as the Equivolume charts but include other factors. Their interpre-
tation is similar to Equivolume interpretation. The same trends, formations, and support and
resistance levels as displayed in regular bar charts are visible.

Point-and-Figure
Point-and-figure charts, by their nature, do not include volume. This omission has forced point-
and-figure analysts who believe that volume is important to find ways to integrate volume statis-
tics into each point-and-figure box, usually through symbols or colors. The standard method is to
sum the volume that took place while each box was in effect and portray it on the chart. From
this, the analyst can quickly visualize where volume occurred in the formation. The individual
analyst using the method must determine whether this information is helpful. A purist in point-
and-figure would argue that volume is unimportant because the price action implies it.
Do Volume Statistics Contain Valuable Information?
Academic papers using volume to confirm technical trading rules are rare. Most academic papers
on volume are concerned with bid-ask spreads and intraday trading versus option trading. The
intraday spread has been of interest because it is a cost of trading that has not been well quanti-
fied. Studies in this sector arose out of the legal requirement of institutions to measure the effec-
tiveness (“best execution”) of their traders and the brokerage firms that handled their orders. The
difference between best execution and the execution received is a cost above the commission and
slippage cost. Often, institutions traded through firms that did not receive the best execution but
provided research and other benefits to the institution. The legal question was, should the cus-
tomer of the institution pay an extra cost for execution through a firm that did not receive the best
execution? Determining the best execution then became a major area of study that remains rela-
tively unanswered today.
Intraday trading relative to option trading was of interest to those attempting to explain
why option prices lagged behind stock prices.

Stock buyer-initiated volume (that which transacts at the ask) minus seller-initiated
volume (that which transacts at the bid) has strong predictive ability for subsequent
stock and option returns, but call or put net-buy volume has little predictive ability.
(Chan, Chung, and Fong, 2002)
Finally, studies done on daily volume and subsequent price action came to the conclusion
that volume statistics had valuable information.
Where we believe our results are most interesting is in delineating the important role
played by volume. In our model, volume provides information in a way distinct from
that provided by price …. Because the volume statistic is not normally distributed, if
traders condition on volume, they can sort out the information implicit in volume
from that implicit in price. We have shown that volume plays a role beyond simply
being a descriptive parameter of the trading process. (Blume, Easley, and O’Hara,
1994, p. 177)
How Are Volume Statistics Used?
ptg
Volume indicators and signals are usually derived not from volume itself, but from a change in
volume. Volume by itself may be a measure of liquidity in a security, but it is not helpful for price
analysis. Volume is usually different in every security, based on factors beyond the ability for the
security to rise and fall. For example, at the end of 2005, average daily volume for Wal-Mart was
around 15 million shares. The average daily volume for Coca-Cola was only about half of that.
The term “volume” used in conjunction with indicators and technical signals really refers to
change in volume. We also use that convention.
How should a change in volume be interpreted? These general rules date back to the work
of H. M. Gartley in 1935:
1. When prices are rising:
a. Volume increasing is impressive.
b. Volume decreasing is questionable.
2. When prices are declining:
a. Volume increasing is impressive.
b. Volume decreasing is questionable.
3. When a price advance halts with high volume, it is potentially a top.
4. When a price decline halts with high volume, it is potentially a bottom.
In other words, price change on high volume tends to occur in the direction of the trend,
and price change on low volume tends to occur on corrective price moves. Higher volume is usu-
ally necessary in an advance because it demonstrates active and aggressive interest in owning the
stock. However, higher volume is not necessary in a decline; prices can decline because of a lack
of interest and, thus, potential buyers in the stock, resulting in relatively light volume.

416 Part V Trend Confirmation
As in all technical indicators, exceptions to the preceding rules can occur. These rules are
only guides. Bulkowski, in his analysis of chart patterns, for example, found many profitable
instances of patterns breaking out on low volume rather than the traditionally expected high vol-
ume. Larry Williams has reported on short-term studies of volume accompanying advances and
declines and found little or no correlation. In a study of price-volume crossover patterns, Kauf-
man and Chaikin (1991) demonstrated that the prevailing wisdom is not always born out by fact.
In a price-volume crossover chart, price closes within short trends are plotted on the vertical axis,
and corresponding volume is plotted on the horizontal axis. Lines are drawn connecting these
successive points, and when the lines cross, a crossover has occurred. Thus, the charts display the
sequence of rising or falling price versus rising or falling volume. Kaufman and Chaikin found,
for example, that rising volume in an advance was not necessarily positive, and that declines
could occur on both rising and declining volume.
Nevertheless, we look at specific examples in the indicator descriptions next. We will see
that volume is a secondary indicator to price analysis, and that though it is not always consistent,
it can often be useful as a warning of trend change, especially on any sharp increases. As always,
one must thoroughly test each assumption made about volume characteristics. The correlations
between signals and price are not reliable enough to be absolute rules, and using the traditional
rules too strictly can often lead to incorrect conclusions about price action.
ptg
Which Indexes and Oscillators Incorporate Volume?
Let us look at some specific examples of indicators that analysts use when looking at volume as
a confirming indicator. These indicators are divided principally into two categories: indexes and
oscillators.
Volume-Related Indexes
Technical analysts have developed a number of volume related indexes. On-Balance-Volume is
probably the most well known of these.
On-Balance-Volume (OBV)
On-Balance-Volume (OBV) is the granddaddy of all volume indexes. Joseph Granville proposed
OBV in his 1976 book, A New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Maximum Profit. The
daily data that is cumulated into the index is the volume for the day adjusted for the direction of
the price change from the day before. Thus, it is the total daily volume added to the previous day
index if the price close was higher and subtracted from the previous day index if the price close
was lower than that of the previous day. This index is a cumulative sum of the volume data and is
plotted on a daily price chart. Figure 18.4 shows what a plot of OBV volume looks like.

The idea behind the OBV index is simply that high volume in one direction and low volume in the opposite
direction should confirm the price trend. If high volume is not confirming the price trend, then light volume in
the price trend direction and heavy volume in the opposite direction suggests an impending reversal. Observ-
ing the OBV line by itself, therefore, is not helpful, but observing its trend and its action relative to price action
is. For example, in a trending market, when prices reach a new high, confirmation of the price strength comes
when the OBV also reaches a new high. If the OBV does not reach a new high and confirm price strength, neg-
ative divergence has occurred, warning that the price advance may soon reverse downward. A negative diver-
gence suggests that volume is not expanding with the price rise.
FIGURE 18.4 On-Balance-Volume (AAPL daily: October 1, 2009–March 26, 2010)
How can the OBV be used in prices that are in a consolidation pattern or trading range
rather than trending? When prices are in a trading range and the OBV breaks its own support or
resistance, the break often indicates the direction in which the price breakout will occur. There-
fore, it gives an early warning of breakout direction from a price pattern.
Let us look a little more closely at Figure 18.4. At the beginning of the chart, prices seem
to be in a trading range. Then, notice how a positive divergence developed at Marker 1. The low
in the OBV did not confirm the new low in price. At Marker 2, the OBV broke above its entire
trading range while price broke upward from a small pennant. The OBV thus confirmed the
breakout that later formed a runaway gap and a large price rise. The “seeds” to that price rise
were sown with the OBV breakout. Finally, notice that after Marker 2, each successive high in
price was accompanied by an equivalent new high in the OBV, continuing to confirm the upward
price trend.

Price and Volume Trend
Another way of calculating a combination of price and volume is to determine daily the percent-
age price change, up or down, times the total volume for the day. This figure is then cumulated
into an index called the price-volume trend. This index will be more heavily impacted when large
percentage price changes occur on heavy volume. Signals are triggered in the same manner as for
the OBV.
In Figure 18.5, notice that this method, using the same data as Figure 18.4, shows the
price-volume trend confirming only after the upward gap breakout in March. Indeed, this method
in this case merely tracks the price changes and shows little in the way of signals of impending
trend change.

Williams Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD)
Larry Williams believes that the open and close prices are the most important price of the day.
The Williams Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) calculates the difference between
the close and the open and relates it to the range as a percentage. For example, if a stock opened
at its low price of the day and closed at its high price of the day, this percentage would be 100%.
The other extreme would be if a stock opened at P , moved higher (or lower) during trading, but
1
returned to close at P , then the percentage would be 0%. This percentage is then multiplied by
1
the daily volume to estimate the amount of volume traded between the open and close.

Chapter 18 Confirmation 419
The new volume figure is then added or subtracted from the previous day WVAD and
drawn on a price chart. It can also be converted into a moving average or oscillator. Interpretation
of the WVAD is identical to the other volume indexes.
Accumulation Distribution (AD)
In 1975, financial newspapers no longer published the opening prices of stocks. Marc Chaikin,
using the Williams WVAD formula as a base, created the Accumulation Distribution (AD) index
that uses the high, low, and close prices each day. The basic figure determines where within the
daily price range the close occurs in the formula:
Volume ×([close – low] – [high – close]) / (high – low)
Thus, if the close occurs above its midpoint for the day, the result will be a positive num-
ber, called accumulation. Conversely, a negative number occurs when a stock closes below its
midpoint for the day, and distribution is said to occur. Each daily figure is then cumulated into an
index similar to the OBV, and the same general rules of divergences apply.
Figure 18.6 shows a plot of the AD index using Chaikin’s formula. The trend was generally
downward during the large consolidation period but then suddenly turned upward and broke
above a lengthy trend line. This index tends to form trends and channels. The signal break-
through anticipated the later upward break to a new high by six days. ptg

Williams Accumulation Distribution (WAD)
Not to be confused with the earlier Williams Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) or
Chaikin’s Accumulation Distribution (AD), the Williams Accumulation Distribution (WAD) also
eliminates the use of the open price no longer reported in the financial newspapers. This indica-
tor uses the concept of True Range that J. Welles Wilder developed during the same general
period.
The True Range uses the previous day’s close as a benchmark and avoids the problems that
arise when a price gaps between days. The calculations for the True Range high and low are
based on a comparison. The True Range high, for example, is either the current day’s high or the
previous day’s close, whichever is higher. The True Range low is either the current day’s low or
the previous day’s close, whichever is lower.
In the WAD, accumulation occurs on days in which the close is greater than the previous
day’s close; the price move on these days is calculated as the difference between the current day
close and the True Range low. Distribution occurs on a day when the close is less than the previ-
ous day’s close; the price move on these days is the difference between the current day close and
the True Range high, which will result in a negative number. Each price move is multiplied by
the volume for the respective day, and the resulting figures are cumulated into an index, the
WAD.1
ptg
Volume-Related Oscillators
Unlike indexes, volume-related oscillators are somewhat bounded. When an oscillator
approaches the upper bound, an overbought condition occurs; when it approaches the lower
bound, an oversold condition occurs. Oscillators are especially useful during trading ranges.
Volume Oscillator
The volume oscillator is the simplest of all oscillators. It is merely the ratio between two moving
averages of volume. Its use is to determine when volume is expanding or contracting. Expanding
volume implies strength to the existing trend, and contracting volume implies weakness in the
existing trend. It is, thus, useful as a confirmation indicator for trend and for giving advanced
warning in a range or consolidation formation of the direction of the next breakout. For example,
if within the range, the oscillator rises during small advances and declines during small declines,
it suggests that the eventual breakout will be upward.
Let us look at Figure 18.7. Like volume itself, the volume oscillator should confirm the
price trend. In this example, the oscillator confirmed the price trend until November (the period
marked 1). Then this relationship broke down, and volume failed to confirm the upward trend.
From marked period 2 until March, a declining oscillator accompanied each subsequent price
rally, and a rising oscillator accompanied each price decline. This series of divergences was a
warning that the stock trend was no longer healthy. Finally, at the period marked 3, the oscillator
confirmed the price rally. This signaled that a new upward trend had begun. As you can see, the
1. Steven B. Achelis introduced a variation of the WAD in this book, Technical Analysis from A to Z (2001). This varia-
tion eliminates the multiplication by volume and is thus not a volume index but a price index. Achelis’s variation is often
incorrectly identified in software programs on price indicators as the Williams Accumulation Distribution.

Chaikin Money Flow
The Chaikin Money Flow is an oscillator that uses the (Chaikin) AD calculation for each day. It
is calculated by summing the ADs over the past 21 days and dividing that sum by the total vol-
ume over the past 21 days. This produces an oscillator that rises above zero when an upward
trend begins and declines below zero when the trend turns downward.
Remember that each daily Chaikin AD calculation is based only on that particular day’s
high, low, and closing prices; therefore, if a gap occurs, it is not reflected in this oscillator.
Another potential problem with this oscillator, as with all oscillators constructed using simple
moving averages, is that simply dropping the number that occurred 21 days prior from the calcu-
lation can influence the current value of the oscillator. Remember that as an oscillator, this tool
is used for confirmation, not signal generation.
Twiggs Money Flow
Colin Twiggs of www.incrediblecharts.com has adjusted the Chaikin Money Flow to account for
st
the potential problems of gaps and the 21 -day drop-off. Twiggs eliminates the problem of gaps
influencing the price strength by using Wilder’s True Range, similarly to how Williams uses it in
his WAD. In addition, using Wilder’s calculation of an exponential moving average solves the
problem of the drop-off figure affecting the current oscillator.

Chaikin Oscillator
Just to confuse things even more, Marc Chaikin invented the Chaikin Oscillator, as opposed to
the Chaikin Money Flow. This oscillator is simply the ratio of the 3-day EMA of the AD to the
10-day EMA of the AD. Chaikin recommends that a 20-day price envelope, such as a Bollinger
Band, also be used as an indication of when signals from the oscillator will be more reliable.
Most signals are from divergences.
Figure 18.8 shows how well the Chaikin Oscillator signals short-term reversals within a
trading range. The overbought and oversold levels in the chart demonstrate how the use of a stan-
dard deviation calculation for overbought and oversold can look. As with Bollinger Bands, the
narrowing of the bands shows a decline in volatility. Declining volatility precedes significant
price moves and is, thus, a warning of change in direction if not intensity. Notice also that when
the stock price begins to trend upward, the oscillator gives premature sell signals. As mentioned
earlier, this is the danger of using oscillators in a trending market.

Money Flow Index (Oscillator)
Another method of measuring money flow into and out of a stock is the Money Flow Index. It
considers “up” days and “down” days to determine the flow of money into and out of an equity.
The money flow on any particular day is the day’s typical, or average, price multiplied by the
daily volume. The day’s typical price is determined as the average of the high, low, and close.
Therefore, money flow on Day i would be calculated as
MF = {(High + Low + Close) / 3} ×Volume

Chapter 18 Confirmation 423
If Day i’s average price is higher than the previous day’s average price, there is positive
money flow (PMF). Conversely, if Day i’s average price is lower than the previous day’s average
price, negative money flow (NMF) occurs. The analyst chooses a specific period to consider and
sums all the PMF together and all the NMF for that period. Dividing the sum of PMF by the sum
of NMF results in the money flow ratio (MFR):
MFR = ΣPMF / ΣNMF
The Money Flow Index is then calculated using the formula:
Money Flow Index = 100 – (100 / (1 + MFR))
The Money Flow Index is an oscillator with a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 0. When
positive money flow is relatively high, the oscillator approaches 100; conversely, when negative
money flow is relatively high, the oscillator approaches 0. A level above 80 is often considered
overbought and below 20 oversold. These parameters, along with the period, are obviously
adjustable.
In addition, another variation of the Money Flow Index uses a ratio between positive
money flow and the total dollar volume (rather than the NMF) over the specified period to calcu-
late the money flow ratio. We used this method of calculation in Figure 18.9. Generally, the
ptg
results of this method are not significantly different from the method we described earlier. In this
example, we use 1.5 ×standard deviation as the overbought and oversold levels, and treat it like
a Bollinger Band where the signals occur in the direction of the breakout from within the band.
This has mediocre results, but it does catch the beginning of the large upward trend that begins in
February. As in other oscillators, it has trouble once prices begin to trend and gives premature
exit signals.
Elder Force Index (EFI)
The EFI is an easy oscillator to calculate in that it uses only closing prices and daily volume. The
daily price change is calculated as the daily closing price minus the previous day’s closing price.
This daily price change is then multiplied by the day’s volume. The index is simply an exponen-
tial moving average over some specified period of the daily price change multiplied by the vol-
ume.
The purpose of this index is to measure the volume strength of a trend. The higher the level
of the oscillator above zero, the more powerful the trend. A negative crossover through zero
would thus indicate a weakening in trend power, and a deep negative would suggest strong power
to the downside.
We have plotted the EFI in Figure 18.10. Elder suggests using either a 2-day EMA for trad-
ing or a 13-day EMA for trend determination. We used 13 days. You can see how erratic the EFI
can be. In theory, a trade should be made whenever the centerline is crossed. As a mechanical
method, this would have been disastrous as a number of whipsaws occurred. However, as a con-
firmation device, the index has merit. For example, Figure 18.10 shows a triangle pattern, a
broadening pattern, a pennant, a flag, and a pennant/flag in succession. By checking the EFI each
time price broke out of these patterns to see if it was confirming the direction of the breakout
would have been helpful. The zigzag in late January would have caused concern, but otherwise,
the EFI properly confirmed each of the subsequent breakouts.

Other Volume Oscillators
We have just studied the most commonly used volume oscillators. As always, a large number of
variations exist, a few of which we mention here. Because these volume oscillators are variations
of the more common ones we just discussed, the signals from overbought and oversold or diver-
gences are similar.
Ease of Movement (EMV) is an oscillator developed by the volume expert Richard W.
Arms. It uses a different calculation to determine daily price differences—namely, the average of
the high and low for one day versus the average for the high and low of the previous day. The for-
mula for calculating the EMV is the following:
EMV = [(Low + High) / 2 – (Low + High ) / 2] ÷ Volume / [Low + High) / 2]
i i i–1 i–1 i i
The result is a figure that measures the effect of volume on the daily range. The EMV is
usually smoothed using a moving average because it can be erratic from day to day.
Volume Rate of Change is simply a ratio or percentage change between today’s volume and
the volume of some specified day in the past. For example, a ten-day rate of change would be
today’s volume versus the volume ten days ago. This method has problems because the drop-off
number ten days prior, for example, will influence the current day’s reading and might not have
significance to recent trading. The ratio is used to identify spikes in volume (see the next sec-
tion), but is not a reliable indicator by itself. ptg
Volume Spikes
Volume spikes (not to be confused with price spikes) are most common at the beginning of a
trend and at the end of a trend. The beginning of a trend often arises out of a pattern with a break-
out, and the end of a trend often occurs on a speculative or panic climax. Higher-than-usual vol-
ume tends to occur with each event. By screening for volume, the trader can often find issues that
are either ready to reverse or that have already reversed. The usual method of screening for a vol-
ume spike is to compare daily volume with a moving average. The trader can look for volume
that is either a number of standard deviations from the average volume or a particular percentage
deviation from the average. As for interpretation of the spike when it occurs, it is often difficult
to determine which variety of spike has occurred until after the spike peaks and you observe the
subsequent price action.
Usually there is a reason for a volume spike, but the reason for the spike might be unrelated
to the technical issues of price trends and behavior. Of course, heavy trading might be related to
a news announcement made about the company. Or, heavy trading volume in a stock can occur if
the stock is a component of an index or basket that had a large institutional trade that day.
Options expiring can also influence volume figures. In all spikes, any outside reason must first be
investigated because it might have nothing to do with the issue’s trend and price behavior.
Volume Spike on Breakout
Breakouts are usually obvious. High volume on a gap or on a breakout from a preexisting chart
pattern is usually the sign of a valid breakout. Although breakouts do not necessarily require high
volume, many analysts use a spike in volume as a confirmation of the breakout and ignore those
without a volume spike.

Volume Spike and Climax
A climax usually marks the end of a trend and either a subsequent reversal or consolidation. Cli-
maxes come in many forms, however, and are not always identifiable except in retrospect. Gen-
erally, climaxes occur with one of the short-term reversal patterns outlined in Chapter 17,
“Short-Term Patterns.” These typically can be price spikes or poles, one- or two-bar reversals,
exhaustion gaps, key reversals, or any of the other short-term reversal patterns.
Examples of Volume Spikes
A number of volume spikes appear in Figure 18.11. The first accompanies a breakaway gap, and
the second is showing that large support exists at that price level, the same level as filled the ear-
lier gap. The third instance occurred when prices tried to break above the resistance level at $215.
It ran into heavy selling and turned down. Finally, a volume spike occurred on the runaway gap
in early March. The high volumes at the support and resistance levels are often important clues
as to changes in direction. If price meets those levels on heavy volume and then reverses direc-
tion, those levels are extremely important and must be recorded for future use. For example, the
high volume low at marker 2 provided the support that also stopped the decline at marker 3. It
told of huge buying pressure at that level. Likewise, the gap in March was caused by the realiza-
ptg
tion that the earlier sellers who stopped the retracement to the resistance level at $215 were gone,
and the stock price was free to rise to the next level of resistance at $240.

Chapter 18 Confirmation 427
Shock Spiral
When we looked at the Dead Cat Bounce (DCB) in Chapter 17, we saw that a substantial volume
spike occurs prior to the formation. Remember that the DCB occurs after a shocking news
announcement causes a sudden and dramatic shift in price direction, usually accompanied by a
large gap or a price spike. An extreme spike in volume accompanies that sudden shift. Tony
Plummer (2003) uses the term “shock spiral” to describe the entire A-B-C pattern from the shock
(A) to the DCB (B) to the final decline (C). The usual shock spiral is to the downside, but Plum-
mer advocates that it can also occur on the upside.
Volume Price Confirmation Indicator (VPCI)
In a series of two articles in Active Trader Magazine and one in the Journal of Technical Analy-
sis, Buff Dormier (2005) introduced a method of comparing a volume-weighted price moving
average with a simple price moving average to determine whether volume is confirming price
action. A positive deviation in the VPCI suggested that the volume was confirming the price
action, and a negative deviation suggested that the volume was contradicting price action.
Volume Dips
Sharp declines in volume are usually not meaningful. The decline in volume generally indicates ptg
a decline in interest in the security, which is usually accompanied by a decline in volatility. For
that reason, the issue should be ignored during the period of low volume, but the trader should be
watching for an increase in volume and volatility. A volume dip is also typical for action just
before a sudden expansion in price and volume, as in a breakout from a formation. Declines in
volume can also occur before holidays, on summer days, and at other times when general activ-
ity is low.
OPEN INTEREST
The volume-related indexes and oscillators we have just discussed are based, in part, on the num-
ber of shares or contracts traded over a specific period of time. In the futures market, the total
number of contracts outstanding is another important factor. The number of outstanding futures
contracts is called “open interest.”
What Is Open Interest?
In the futures markets, only contracts trade, not physical instruments or items. At the expiration
of the specific futures market delivery month, the number of contracts reduces to zero as buyers
and sellers “roll” their contracts into the next expiration, or make or take delivery of the product
or cash as the contracts require. The number of contracts outstanding at any one time in each
delivery month is its open interest. Total open interest is the number of contracts outstanding in
all delivery months. It is an excellent tool in estimating the liquidity of most contracts. However,
open interest is a different figure than volume. Volume is the number of contracts traded during a
certain period in a specific futures market delivery month, not the number of contracts outstand-
ing.

428 Part V Trend Confirmation
Although open interest is a good tool for estimating the liquidity of a contract, using it for
technical trading can be a bit tricky. One problem is that open interest rises at the beginning and
declines at the expiration of each contract market. This action is often unrelated to the trend. In
addition, in many futures markets, the clearinghouse takes time to calculate the open interest and
actual cleared volume. The figures are only available to the public on the following morning.
Open Interest Indicators
Futures contracts are created as interest develops in the specific futures market and become elim-
inated as interest in the futures market recedes. Thus, the conventional interpretation of open
interest is that expanding open interest confirms interest in the existing trend of the futures con-
tract price. This expansion should also be accompanied by increasing volume. Expanding open
interest and volume during an upward trend, for example, suggests buyers are creating more new
contracts than old contracts. When the upward trend continues but open interest and volume
decline, old contract holders are selling and absorbing any new buyers, suggesting that the trend
may soon reverse direction. In a correction within an upward trend, declining open interest and
volume suggest that the major trend is still healthy. In this sense, open interest is used similarly
to volume.
Larry Williams believes that open interest reflects the commercials because they account ptg
for such a substantial percentage of volume activity. Commercials are generally short futures
contracts used to hedge against inventory. Thus, a decline in open interest, he reasons, is a sign
that commercials are covering shorts and that the price will likely rise. He warns that this strat-
egy should only be used in a trading range, and that a 30% change in open interest is necessary
before action is contemplated. Colby argues that Williams’ strategy does not work in the stock
index futures, but he did not test the requirement for a range only.
As we know from Chapter 7, “Sentiment,” the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitment of Traders Reports provide breakdowns in open interest by category of trader.
Some analysts have compared this data with the data reported daily by the commodity exchanges
and used the resulting ratios and changes as indicators of professional and amateur trading action
(Greco, 2001). These relations and calculations are complicated and go beyond our present
scope.
Herrick Payoff Index (Oscillator)
John Herrick (1982) developed a complex oscillator based on price, volume, and open interest.
As in many oscillators, interpretation is based on whether the index is above or below zero and
whether divergences exist between volume and open interest and price velocity. Thomas Aspray
(Stocks & Commodities Magazine, V.6:3, 115–118) has also found that in the Herrick Payoff
Index, trend lines are often informative for warnings of a change in price direction, as are the
penetration of support and resistance levels.
Figure 18.12 of live cattle futures displays the Herrick Payoff Index (HPI) and its 14-week
EMA. Cattle has some erratic moves over the period especially in 2009, but it often shows a diver-
gence between price and the HPI (marked with a dashed line as 1 and 2) at its peak and trough.
Generally, when the HPI is above zero, prices are in an upward trend. This has not always been the

Trend lines are also shown in HPI (with solid lines), as well as action price (arrow) at which they
were broken. The combination of trend line breaks and divergences seems to be favorable.

Other Open Interest Indicators
A number of combinations of open interest, price, and volume have been proposed. Most
demonstrate what the Herrick Payoff Index displays, and the methods of analysis are the same as
for other oscillators. One example is the On Balance Open Interest Indicator. William Painter
proposed this indicator, which uses open interest instead of volume in an Price and Open Interest
Index (POI), proposed by R. Earle Hadady (1989). This index is calculated similarly to the Price
and Volume Indicator using the change in price times the change in open interest.
PRICE CONFIRMATION
Confirmation is concerned with determining whether a price trend is continuing or coming to an
end. One group of indicators uses measures based upon the movement of price itself to confirm
the trend. Generally, these indicators are based upon the concept of momentum.

430 Part V Trend Confirmation
What Is Momentum?
Momentum deals with the rate at which prices are changing. For example, in an uptrend, prices
are rising and the trend line slopes upward. Momentum measures how quickly the prices are ris-
ing, or how steeply the trend line is sloping. In high school calculus, you probably learned that
the slope of a line is called the first derivative, and that the change in that slope is called the sec-
ond derivative. Momentum is, thus, the second derivative of price action over some period.
Momentum is similar to acceleration and deceleration. For example, let us assume that a
car is initially traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour; at this point, the car has a con-
stant travel slope of 30. When the car starts accelerating, it is gaining momentum, and its travel
slope is increasing. At some point, the car cannot maintain the level of acceleration, and the rate
of increase in speed begins to decline. The car is then said then to be decelerating, even though it
is still traveling at an increasing rate of speed. The speed itself is not increasing as fast as earlier,
so momentum is falling.
The same principle applies to markets. Speed is equivalent to the slope of the price trend—
the number of points gained per day, for instance. Momentum is equivalent to the car’s accelera-
tion and deceleration and is the measure of the price trend’s changing slope. Trend can be
thought of as direction and momentum can be thought of as the rate of speed of the price change.
For example, suppose that a stock is originally selling for $25 a share. If the same stock is selling ptg
for $30 a share five days later, then the stock price has increased by $5 in five days. The momen-
tum would be $5 in five days (or $1 per day). If over the next five days, the price continues to
increase to $34, the trend is still upward. However, the rate of change (or momentum) has slowed
to $4 in five days.
Technical analysts have developed many indicators to measure momentum, and these
measures have become leading signal generators or confirmation gauges, telling us whether the
trend slope is changing. When momentum is confirming the price trend, a convergence or confir-
mation occurs; when momentum is failing to confirm the price trend slope by giving a warning
signal, a divergence occurs. As a sign of price trend change then, the technical analyst often
looks for a divergence.
Confirmation also is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. Remember that
prices never follow a trend in an absolute straight line. Prices oscillate about a central trend, devi-
ating above and below the trend. When prices are considerably above the trend, the expectation
is that prices will return down to the central trend and perhaps even fall below the trend line.
When prices are noticeably above the central trend, an overbought condition exists. When prices
are considerably below the trend, they are to be oversold and are likely to return up to the central
trend and, perhaps, above.
Analysts have developed many types of oscillators to measure what is overbought and
oversold. These oscillators usually are based on price but can also be based on volume or other
data. Mathematically, these oscillators eliminate the trend and look only at the oscillations about
the trend.
Suppose that you are watching a particular stock and notice a breakout occurring. An oscil-
lator can be useful in determining the validity of the breakout. If an oscillator is oversold, this
breakout is more likely to be valid than if the oscillator were overbought. However, in some

Chapter 18 Confirmation 431
instances, buy signals are generated from an overbought oscillator accompanied by other indica-
tors (as we will see with the popsteckle later in this chapter).
A word of warning about using oscillators, however, is warranted. Traders often incor-
rectly use oscillators to generate signals without respect for the underlying trend direction. This
will result in many false signals. Remember, profits are made from anticipating and riding the
trend. Indicators and oscillators should only be used as secondary evidence to confirm the trend;
otherwise, the analyst is likely in for trouble.
To combat the tendency to focus on overbought/oversold signals while ignoring the under-
lying trend, analysts have developed a number of adjustments and filters to account for trend
more mechanically. Adjustments include altering the oscillator parameters, such as the period
over which the oscillator is calculated and the signal levels. Other adjustments are even more
sophisticated, using digital filters or other mathematical means of filtering and smoothing. The
bottom line, however, is that by and large the results are the same. In fact, some analysts argue
that increasing the complexity of the calculations only produces a false confidence. They also
argue that complexity breeds an increase in the possibility for error when one of the parameters
changes and does not allow the analyst the opportunity to gain practical experience. The indica-
tor or oscillator becomes too mechanical. Whatever the arguments, however, even in their sim-
plest forms, indicators and oscillators are useful as confirmation of price behavior, once the
quirks are understood and the dependence upon them is secondary. ptg
How Successful Are Momentum Indicators?
Momentum indicators are based on price information. Most academic studies of technical indi-
cators attempt to demonstrate whether price action is random and, if not, whether this apparent
nonrandomness violates some of the principles of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. As such,
these studies are usually of little use to practicing technical analysts who introduce many more
variables into trading or investment decisions.
It is difficult for academics to construct tests that take into account all of the intricacies of
real trading. When studying moving averages, for example, how would the requirement for pro-
tective stops around support and resistance be integrated? What kind of exit strategy should be
used?
The trader must account for risk, as well as return, when considering the usefulness of an
indicator. The academic concept of risk is considerably different from that which the practical
investor must consider. Therefore, as we will see in Chapter 22, “System Design and Testing,”
when we look at testing methods, the measurements of risk provided in academic studies are not
the same measures that a practitioner would use.
Finally, we will note that any method tested by academia has very likely already been dis-
carded by the technical analysis world as outdated. By its nature, academia will always be behind
the advances made in the more practical world. Nevertheless, academic studies are useful in
determining the direction in which to look for means of profiting from technical analysis. For
example, if a particular indicator shows no advantage over the random hypothesis, it should be
treated with considerably more skepticism than one that does show some statistically relevant
results.

432 Part V Trend Confirmation
Most academic studies of price indicators, so far, have focused exclusively on moving
averages. Interestingly, there have been very few studies of standard technical indicators. The
two most recent studies of indicators are Bauer and Dahlquist (1999a, 1999b) and Thomas
(2003). The Bauer and Dahlquist study covered 60 technical signals, including popular oscilla-
tors, for 878 stocks over the period from 1985 through 1996, a period of generally rising stock
prices. The Thomas study included price and volume oscillators for 1,750 stocks over the five-
year period from 1995 through July 2001, a time during which the stock market had a significant
advance and decline.
Specific Indexes and Oscillators
Remember that because momentum indexes and oscillators are based on price data, they do not
add new information to the analysis. They are simply manipulations of the same data. This
means that they are less informative than other indicators, such as volume, that provide new and
different information. The analyst, therefore, must be careful when using price indicators, as
confirmation may be more redundant than informative. This is not to say that a different manip-
ulation of the data cannot be helpful, only that the base data itself is the same. For example,
watching several different price oscillators calculated over the same period is silly because by
their nature, they will be providing roughly the same results. Watching several price oscillators ptg
over different periods or including volume or some other different information would be more
productive.
We describe the most common price momentum oscillators next. There are many ways of
calculating momentum, but because all of them arrive at essentially the same result, we describe
only the most common and most popular.
Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)
Gerald Appel, publisher of Systems and Forecasts, developed the Moving Average Convergence-
Divergence (MACD) oscillator. A variation of the moving average crossover, the MACD is cal-
culated using the difference between two exponential moving averages. Traditionally, a
26-period EMA is subtracted from a 12-period EMA, but these times are adjustable for shorter
and longer period analysis. This calculation results in a value that oscillates above and below
zero. A positive MACD indicates that the average price during the past 12 periods exceeds the
average price over the past 26 periods.
The MACD line is plotted at the bottom of a price chart along with another line—the sig-
nal line. The signal line is an exponential moving average of the MACD; a nine-period EMA is
the most common. A histogram of the difference between the MACD and the signal line often
appears at the bottom of the chart. You can see this type of plot in Figure 18.13. The chart dis-
plays the MACD (thin black line), the signal line (thick gray line), and the histogram of the dif-
ference between the MACD and its signal line for Apple Computer over the same period as the
other charts in this chapter.
The MACD is useful in a trending market because it is unbounded. When the MACD is
above zero, it signals that the faster (shorter-term) moving average is above the slower (longer-
term) moving average. The converse is true when the MACD is below the zero line. Crude sig-
nals occur when the MACD crosses the zero line, but these are just the same signals as would be
generated from a moving average crossover.

==================================================

Chapter 18 Confirmation 433
Other information can be gleaned from the MACD, however. For example, when the
MACD is above zero, suggesting an upward trend, buy signals occur when the MACD crosses
from below to above the signal line. Downward crossings are not at all reliable while the trend is
upward. Through experimentation to determine overbought and oversold levels, analysts can use
these levels as places to generate signals for price reversion to the central trend. These extremes
showed good performance results in the Thomas study of oscillators.
Additionally, some analysts compare the peaks and valleys in the MACD with the price
line in a divergence analysis. Bauer and Dahlquist suggest that divergences can be useful, espe-
cially in a downward trending market. The peaks and valleys in the histogram provide two useful
sets of information. They can be used for divergence analysis, and because they are sensitive to
price directional change over short periods, they can also be used to signal shorter price trend
changes within the longer trend.
Let us look a little more closely at Figure 18.13. A significant negative divergence devel-
oped in January when the MACD failed to confirm the new price high. A downward crossover
from above the midpoint in November and January gave sell signals. The usual way to handle
these is to place an entry stop just below the low of the signal bar to be executed if the price con-
tinues downward. As a protective stop, the previous high is the safest. This method would have
worked well in both downward crossovers. There were also two upward crossovers from below
the midpoint line, one in December and one in February. Using the same method as in the short ptg
selling on buying long instead, again both buy signals would have been profitable. Why did we not
sell at the slight crossover in April? We would have placed a short entry stop at the low of the bar
coinciding with the dip, but it never was triggered, leaving us still long from the buy in February.

Rate of Change (ROC)
Rate of change (ROC) is likely the simplest oscillator. It is a measure of the amount a stock’s
price has changed over a given number (N) of past periods. The formula for calculating ROC is
as follows:
ROC = {(P – P ) / P } ×100
today N periods ago N periods ago
With this calculation, ROC is zero if the price today is the same as it was N periods ago. It
shows on a continuous basis how the current price relates to the past price.
Even though it is very simple to calculate, the ROC has many problems as an indicator.
Although economists often calculate ROC using macroeconomic data, usually on an annual
basis to minimize seasonality, it suffers from the drop-off effect. Only two prices, Ptoday and
PN periods ago, appear in the calculation, and these two prices are equally weighted. Therefore, the
older price that occurred N periods ago has the same effect as the current, and probably more rel-
evant, price on the oscillator. The ROC can, thus, have a current rise or fall based solely on what
number drops off in the past. Some analysts will smooth the ROC with a moving average to
dampen this effect.
Analysts use the ROC in the standard four ways. Its position relative to zero can indicate
the underlying trend; it can be a divergence oscillator showing when the momentum relative to
ptg
the past is changing; it can be an overbought/oversold indicator; and it can generate a signal
when it crosses over its zero line. In none of the instances is the signal reliable, however.
Figure 18.14 shows a graphical representation of a 14-day ROC for Apple Computer. At
marker 2, we see a classic negative divergence where the ROC failed to confirm the new high in
price. At marker 1, we see the variation of negative divergence called a negative reversal where
the price fails to confirm a new high in the ROC. Both patterns have negative consequences, as
the chart shows. We used the same trading signal method as we used in Figure 18.12 with the
MACD and marked with arrows on the chart where the initial entry stops should have been
placed. The only difference was that signals were generated using a filter around the midpoint
line to dampen the number of false signals when the price trend was flat. This method worked
equally as well with the ROC as with the MACD.
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
In June 1978, J. Welles Wilder introduced the relative strength index (RSI) in an article in Com-
modities (now known as Futures) magazine. The RSI measures the strength of an issue against
its history of price change by comparing “up” days to “down” days. Wilder based his index on
the assumption that overbought levels generally occur after the market has advanced for a dispro-
portionate number of days, and that oversold levels generally follow a significant number of
declining days.
Be careful to understand that the RSI measures a security’s strength relative to its own
price history, not to that of the market in general. Because of its name, a common misconception
is that this indicator compares one security with other securities.

To construct the RSI, several calculations must be made, as follows:
UPS = (Sum of gains over N periods) / N
DOWNS = (Sum of losses over N periods) / N
RS = UPS / DOWNS
RSI = 100 – [100 / (1 + RS)]
The RSI can range from a low of 0 (indicating no up days) to a high of 100.2 In his original
calculations, Wilder used 14 days as the relevant period. Although some analysts have attempted
to use a time-weighted period, these methods have not been well accepted, and the 14-day period
remains the most commonly used.
2. DOWNS is the sum of losses. In the calculation, the absolute values of the losses are added together. In other words,
if a stock closes at $36 one day and $34 the next day, the loss is $2 (not a –$2 loss).

436 Part V Trend Confirmation
After calculating the RSI for the first 14 days, Wilder used a smoothing method to calcu-
late RSI for future days. This process dampens the oscillations. For day 15 and after
UPS = [(UPS ×13) + Gain ] / 14
day i day i–1 day i
DOWNS = [DOWNS ×13) + Loss ] / 14
day i day i–1 day i
These measures for UPS and DOWNS are used to calculate RS and RSI. This method of
smoothing the averages is now called the “Wilder exponential moving average” and is used in
many other indicator formulas. We saw, for example, in the section on volume oscillators earlier
in this chapter that the Money Flow oscillator uses the RSI formula.
The RSI has many characteristics that can generate signals. For example, when the RSI is
above 50, the midpoint of the bounded range, the underlying trend in prices is usually upward.
Conversely, it is downward when the RSI is below 50.
Overbought and oversold warnings are the same as with many other indicators. Wilder
considered, for example, an RSI above 70 to indicate an overbought situation and an RSI below
30 to indicate an oversold condition. Analysts will often adjust these levels based on the underly-
ing trend. Chuck LeBeau, for example, uses 75 and 25 as the overbought and oversold extremes
and Brown (1999) uses 90 and 40 in an upward trend and 60 and 10 in a downward trend. She ptg
calls these new levels trend ids. Because the trend in Figure 18.15 is upward, we have drawn, in
addition to the conventional overbought and oversold levels, the trend id of 90 and 40. This gives
us an oversold buy signal in December and in late January that would not have been available
using the conventional method.
Similar to other oscillators, RSI divergences with price often give warning of trend rever-
sal. The RSI also appears to have patterns similar to price charts. Triangles, pennants, flags, and
even head-and-shoulders patterns occur, and support and resistance levels become signal levels.
The rules for breakouts from these formations are used for signals from the RSI.
Another method of signaling is failure swings. A failure swing occurs when the oscillator
exceeds an overbought or oversold level, corrects, reverses back toward the overbought or over-
sold, misses, and then turns back through the correction. Two examples exit in Figure 18.15 and
are marked as such. They occur at lows using the trend id method of determining the oversold
level. Another short-term trading method using the RSI is to place a buy stop above the daily
high when the RSI declines 10 points from a recent peak above 70. This should only be used
when the trend is upward and never when a downward swing failure develops. The buy stop can
be adjusted each day until either it is triggered for a day or two trade or the RSI continues to
decline, suggesting that the trend is reversing downward.
There is also the method called the “RSI is wrong.” In Figure 18.15, the RSI remains above
or near the overbought level for a substantial period from mid-March onward, during which the
AAPL price continued to rise. This method suggests that rather than looking for a top when the
overbought level is penetrated, buy the issue and use a sell stop. Active Trader Magazine (August
2004, p 64–65) tested an “RSI is wrong” system, not optimized, on 19 futures from 1994 through
2003 with the following rules: Buy when 14-day RSI penetrates above 75; sell when RSI pene-
trates 25 or after 20 days. The opposite rules apply for sells using a break below the RSI 25 level
as the initial short sale. The results showed a steady, straight equity curve especially for long
positions.

Thomas (2003), in his testing of the RSI, found that none of the conventional signals had
value except the positioning opposite from the conventional overbought/oversold levels of 70
and 30. His testing showed promise for the “RSI is wrong” thesis. Bauer and Dahlquist found
that the conventional use, called a “crossover” system, of selling on a break below the over-
bought 70 and buying on a break above the oversold 30 had marginal returns during the period
tested. They also found that using peaks above 70 and below 30 had marginal returns, and that
the opposite buying at peaks outperformed all signals. Their testing method, however, judged
against the percentage of time in a position and did not account for the reduction in risk when in
cash. Nevertheless, the results were “disappointing.”

FIGURE 18.15 RSI (AAPL daily: October 6, 2009–March 30, 2010)
As the many warnings and signals that occur in Figure 18.15 suggest, the RSI cannot be
interpreted mechanically and is, perhaps, why it does not test well. However, the action is
informative and useful to many traders. In a survey of traders taken in 2005 (Earle), the most
popular indicator was the RSI. In short, traders have developed many methods. If you want to
use the RSI as a confirming indicator, you must learn these methods, experiment with them, and
always be sure of the underlying price trend.
Stochastic Oscillator
All oscillators use a specific time over which they are calculated. The traditional periods for the
MACD are 26 and 12 bars; the RSI traditionally uses 14 bars for its calculation. These oscillators

depend on smoothing techniques that tend to dampen the most recent price action. The stochas-
tic takes another tack. It looks at the most recent close price as a percentage of the price range
(high to low) over a specified past “window” of time. This makes it very sensitive to recent
action. Analysts use the stochastic for trading or investing when the most recent close is the most
important price.
It is not absolutely clear who was the inventor of stochastics. George Lane is known for
promoting the concept since 1954 (Lane, 1985), and it is sometimes referred to as Lane’s Sto-
chastic (Colby, 2003), but others apparently preceded him. Two names mentioned are Ralph
Dystant and a dentist friend of his and Richard Redmont. Dystant introduced the indicator as part
of an Elliott wave course through his Investment Educators, and Lane, who lectured for that firm,
took it over on Dystant’s death in 1978.
Not only is the inventor of stochastics unknown, the origin of the term “stochastics” is not
clear. The name of this oscillator has nothing to do with the scientific term “stochastic,” which
means random or nondeterministic. Of course, traders would hope that this indicator did not pro-
duce random results. So, how did the name stochastic become associated with this indicator?
According to Gibbons Burke (www.io.com/gibbonsb/trading/stochastic.html), Tim Slater,
founder and president of CompuTrac, Inc., included this indicator in the company’s software
analysis program in 1978. He needed a name to attach to the indicator other than the %K and %D
we will see in the indicator calculation. Slater saw a notation of “stochastic process” handwritten ptg
on the original Investment Educators literature he was using. The name stuck. Regardless of who
the actual inventor might be or how it got its name, the stochastic oscillator is one of the most
popular, both for long- and short-term momentum signals.
The formula for the stochastic is as follows:
%K = [(C – L) / (H – L] ×100
fast %D = 3-bar SMA of %K
slow %D = 3-bar SMA of %D
Where: W is the time window (that is, 14 bars)
H is the high for the window period (w)
L is the low for the window period (w)
C is the most recent bar close (w)
The “fast” stochastic, as seen in most trading software, refers to the raw stochastic number
(%K) compared with a three-period simple moving average of that number (fast %D). This num-
ber is extremely sensitive to price changes. Because of the erratic volatility of the fast %D, many
false signals occur with rapidly fluctuating prices. To combat this problem, analysts have created

==================================================

Chapter 18 Confirmation 439
the “slow” stochastic. The slow stochastic is designed to smooth the original %D again with a
three-period simple moving average. In other words, the slow stochastic is a doubly smoothed
moving average, or a moving average of the moving average of %K.
Analysts often create their own variations of the stochastics formula. Lane, for example,
smoothed the numerator separately from the denominator in the %K formula, and then divided
each rather than smoothing the %K itself (Merrill, 1986). He also used only five days in the time
window.
The question of how many periods to use in the window is problematic. The volatility and
cyclical nature of the issue traded, as well as the tendency for these factors to vary, are integral to
choosing a window period. Larry Williams uses a composite of different time window periods
and the True Range rather than the high and low for his “Ultimate Oscillator.” Others adjust the
window period, as well as the number of bars used in smoothing the %K based on their interpre-
tation of the dominant cycle in prices. Many analysts just test the results of signals over different
windows to see which works best.
As in most oscillators, the stochastic works better in a trading range market but can still
give valuable information in a trending market. In a trending market, divergences, trend line
breaks, and swing failures generate signals. During trading ranges, crossovers and swing failures
generate signals when the stochastic reaches overbought or oversold, traditionally 80 and 20.
Crossovers occur when the fast stochastic crosses over the slow stochastic. Following crossovers ptg
without other confirming evidence, however, can cause whipsaws.
As in the RSI and many other oscillators, chart patterns, such as triangles and pennants,
can also evolve in the stochastic oscillator. Support and resistance levels, even without swing
failures, can be useful signals or warnings, and trend lines often appear to warn of potential
changes in momentum. All standard technical rules apply to oscillators. However, oscillators by
themselves should never be used strictly for signals. The analyst must confirm any oscillator sig-
nal with price action—a breakout or a pattern.
Academic testing of standard stochastic signals has had the same mediocre results as with
other oscillators. This is not surprising, of course, because the determination of trend or trading
range is rarely included in academic studies. Indeed, the fact that some positive results have
occurred is encouraging, considering the primitive definitions of signals and circumstances used.
Thomas (2003) found that extreme levels of overbought and oversold were somewhat predictive
of future price direction but that most standard overbought/oversold interpretations failed. Bauer
and Dahlquist (1999) found that acting at peaks and troughs above and below overbought and
oversold respectively had better results on the long side than the short side. Unfortunately, trend
was not a consideration in the testing, and the period tested (1985–1996) was one of a histori-
cally large upward trend when short signals would be expected to fail. Thus, the positive results
for long signals were encouraging, considering that the signals had to keep up with the values in
a generally rising market.
Figure 18.16 shows a 14-3-3 slow stochastic. This means that a 14-day time window was
used; %D was smoothed once using a 3-day SMA and again using another 3-day SMA.

FIGURE 18.16 Stochastic (daily: August 2005–October 2005)
AAPL is in a trending mode during the period considered but swinging in wide swings. In
this case, the use of overbought and oversold levels is fruitful. Each time a buy or sell signal
occurs from breaking toward the midpoint from oversold or overbought, an exit and reentry sig-
nal is given at the opposite extreme. This is not always the case. In a strong upward trend as
developed during the later months of the period in Figure 18.16, the oscillator did not return to
oversold. Thus, overbought breakdown sell signals in a rising trend must be suspect. They can
signal the time to get out of a long trade, but they do not necessarily signal the time to enter a
short trade.
In addition to the overbought/oversold signals, three failure swings occurred in late
November, late December, and late January. The downward signal in late November was timely,
as was the upward failure swing signal in December. The January sell signal was less profitable.
Finally, we see that before the declines in late October and early January, negative diver-
gences developed at the peaks when the stochastic failed to confirm the new price highs.
Other Oscillators, Similar to the Stochastics
Some analysts use oscillators that are very similar to the stochastic oscillator. In particular, the
Williams %R and the Commodity Channel Index are comparable indicators.
Williams %R
The Williams %R oscillator is almost identical to the stochastic. It can be thought of as an
inverted stochastic. Instead of comparing the current close with the low that occurred during the

Chapter 18 Confirmation 441
time window, the Williams %R compares the current close with the high that occurred during the
time window. Thus, the formula for the Williams %R is as follows:
%R = [(H – C) / (H – L)] ×100
The Williams %R tells whether a stock is at a relatively high point in its trading range,
while the stochastic indicates whether a stock is at a relatively low point in its trading range.
Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is also very similar to the stochastic. Donald Lambert
developed this indicator, describing it in the October 1980 issue of Commodities (now known as
Futures) magazine. Do not be fooled by the name of the indicator; it can be used in any market,
not just commodity markets. The CCI measures the deviations of a security’s price from a mov-
ing average. This gives a slightly different picture than the stochastic, and in some cases, the sig-
nals are more reliable. However, the difference between the CCI and the stochastic is so
miniscule that using both would be a duplication of effort and liable to create false confidence.
Figure 18.17 shows how similar the CCI and the stochastic are.
The CCI is not bounded—that is, it can rise above +100 and fall below –100—as is the sto-
chastic, and this bothers some analysts. To avoid this problem, some analysts use a stochastic cal-
culation on the CCI, bounding the CCI to 0 to 100 and smoothing the CCI at the same time. ptg
Barbara Star reports in Active Trader Magazine (2004) that in trending markets, this bounded,
smoothed CCI is often useful for entries in the trend direction, but not in a countertrend direc-
tion, and in trading markets, it often gives overbought and oversold signals.
Similarities Between Oscillators
Figure 18.18 shows a standard 14-day RSI compared with a 3-day to 10-day MACD. See how
the two lines follow almost identical paths. It is, thus, redundant and nonproductive to use many
oscillators that essentially tell the same story. This is why most analysts prefer to use just one, or
perhaps two, oscillators and learn their complexities and intricacies well rather than depend on
mechanical signals from many.
Combinations—Determining Trend and Trading Range
In Chapter 14, “Moving Averages,” we discussed trends, moving averages, and especially the use
of the ADX and its component parts, the DMI+ and DMI–. We found that moving averages were
only profitable in trending markets, just as we have found in this chapter that oscillators are more
profitable in trading markets. The problem, then, is to be able to determine whether a particular
market is trending or trading. Usually markets rotate from one to the other, but the signals gener-
ated by moving averages and indicators are not always quick to decipher the change. Because
most profits come from trending markets, analysts focus on moving averages and oscillators to
determine when a trend is beginning, and the sooner they recognize the trend, the better.
The most common solution is the use of Wilder’s ADX in combination with an oscillator
and a moving average. Because it is smoothed through averaging, the ADX is a lagging indicator
and should not be used for signals except from very low levels when a trend may be beginning.
Its value is in demonstrating the degree to which prices are already trending and, by implication,
suggesting what kinds of analysis—trend or trading range—should be used. It is equally adept at
trend determination from very short-term intraday trading to month-to-month investing.

Chapter 18 Confirmation 443
The use of the ADX is based on its level and its trend. The level determines the amount by
which prices are trending, and the direction shows the change in that trending. Low readings
(<20) suggest a trading range and low volatility in which oscillators and patterns should be used.
A moderately high reading (30) indicates strong trending in which moving average crossovers
and patterns should be used. A very high reading (>45) indicates a potential trend reversal in
which patterns, trends, support and resistance, divergences in oscillators and volume, and oscil-
lator failures should be used. Generally, a rising ADX reflects an increased trending, up or down,
and a declining ADX reflects an approaching reversal or consolidation.
BOX 18.1 GENERAL RULES FOR USING ADX
In an article appearing in Futures Magazine, Ashwani Gujral provided general rules
for using ADX. His guidelines include the following:
When ADX is rising and at a level
Between 15 and 25 Beginning of trending; use trending indicators.
Between 25 and 45 Definite trending; use trending indicators.
ptg
Of 45 or above Overextended; watch for trend turning point; use price
or indicator patterns.
When ADX is declining and at a level
Below 20 Low volatility; very short swings; no trend; use oscil-
lators.
Between 20 and 30 Consolidation; use oscillators.
Between 30 and 45 Correction from extreme likely; use patterns; trending
indicators.
Analysts have developed numerous methods of utilizing the ADX with oscillators and
moving averages. Let us look at two of them: David Steckler’s popsteckle and Linda Raschke’s
holy grail.
Popsteckle
In a 2000 article, appearing in Stocks and Commodities, David Steckler described a method of
identifying stocks that are ready to “pop” upward using all three indicators. The name “pop-
steckle” is a contraction of “pop” and “Steckler,” but Jake Bernstein (1993) is the originator of
the method. Steckler’s setup rules are as follows:
1. Recent price action shows low volatility (dull action).
2. 14-day ADX is below 20 (no trend).

3. Eight-day stochastic %K is greater than the day before and above 70 (upward trend begin-
ning).
4. Eight-week stochastic %K is greater than the week before and above 50 (upward longer
trend beginning).
5. Bullish market conditions exist (could be determined by market price above long-term
moving average).
6. Stock breaks upward out of congestion on volume 50% above its 50-day simple moving
average.
The popsteckle method monitors a low-volatility stock in a horizontal trading range for
signs of positive trending action as displayed by changes in the various stochastics. No history of
back testing this method is available, but the logic of the variables and indicators is consistent.
Holy Grail
Unlike the popsteckle, which looks for the beginning of a new trend, Linda Raschke’s Holy Grail
method takes advantage of an existing trend and uses the ADX in combination with a moving
average. First, a 14-day ADX must be above 30 to indicate an existing trend. The primary trend
is displayed by a 20-period EMA. An initial downturn in the ADX suggests a correction to the
ptg
primary trend. When this occurs, enter in the direction of the trend when the price touches or
comes close to that EMA. On the long side, the entry trigger would be a break above the high of
the most recent declining bar, and it would be the opposite on the short side. The initial target that
Raschke uses is the old price extreme, high or low, at which point the analyst must make a deci-
sion as to whether the price will continue in the primary trend direction or not.
CONCLUSION
To increase the odds that a technical price signal is correct, the technical analyst uses many other
indicators as confirmation. The primary confirmation indicator is volume because it is a series of
data independent of price. Unfortunately, volume indicators and volume itself do not always con-
firm a price pattern. Nevertheless, high volume at the appropriate moments does add value to the
entry decision. Other means of calculating volume for comparison with past volume and price
action have limited value in confirming signals, but they can provide warnings when not con-
firming price action. These divergences cannot be used as signals by themselves but do help the
analyst by suggesting that trend change is soon likely.
The other major area of confirmation comes from momentum, or rate of price change, cal-
culations. Strong momentum suggests a trending market, and weak momentum suggests a con-
solidating market. Naturally, the analyst principally looks for the beginning of a trending market,
and because momentum indicators tend to lead price direction, they are often useful in warning
of such a change. However, the reliability of these indicators is highly dependent upon whether
the security is trading in a trend or in a trading range. By and large, these oscillators are more
useful in trading ranges as overbought/oversold indications. In trending markets, they are more
useful as warnings of trend change. In strong trends, they tend to be skewed in the direction of
the trend and, thus, fail to provide reliable entry signals.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with
• The controversy about whether cycles exist in financial market data ptg
• How cycles are defined by their amplitude, period, and phase
• Detrending data and plotting centered moving averages
• The major methods of determining cycles in market data
• The major methods of using cycles to project future price highs and lows
Throughout this book, we have seen how prices trend, but the trend does not occur in a straight
line. Prices oscillate up and down around a trend. These oscillations form the trading ranges, pat-
terns, and channels we have discussed. Could it be that these oscillations have some sort of reg-
ularity? Believing that they do, cycle analysts look at prices as a form of complex harmonics or
waves. (In physics, a harmonic is a wave whose frequency is a whole number multiple of the fre-
quency of another wave.) Most standard patterns can be broken down into cycle layers. For
example, the head-and-shoulders pattern is a combination of a long cycle peaking with several
smaller cycles forming the shoulders and head. Triangles are periods within an uptrend when the
amplitude of smaller cycles declines and then expands. By breaking down known patterns into
harmonics, these analysts believe that the inherent oscillations are somewhat regular cycles and
are, therefore, predictable.
Not surprisingly, the concept of prices oscillating in cycles is controversial. There are two
basic reasons some oppose the cycle concept. First, if prices behaved in pure cycles, like radio
waves or tuning forks, the numbers would easily fit into mathematical formulas that would give
us precise predictions similar to what we know about ocean tides and sunrises. This has not hap-
pened. The inability to use present mathematical methods to identify specifically and precisely
any existing cycles is evidence to some that there are no such cycles. These objectors claim that

any cycles that traders think they see are merely imaginary. As we saw in Chapter 4, “The Tech-
nical Analysis Controversy,” when they discuss patterns in trading market prices, the human
mind often “sees” patterns in data that do not truly exist.
Another set of objections comes from the inability to identify causes of specific cycles that
many agree do exist in prices. There may be correlations between Super Bowl scores or rainfall
in New York City and stock prices. However, their relationships are merely curious correlations
rather than causation. There is no logical reason why these events would be causal or explana-
tory.
However, we do see that human behavior does strange things during different phases of the
moon. For example, Al Lieber (1978) discusses changes in emotional behavior at regularly
scheduled intervals correlated with phases of the moon in the Journal of Clinical Psychology.
Yuan, Zheng, and Zhu (2006) demonstrate the correlation between lunar phases and stock prices
in 48 countries. The moon rotates around the earth each 29.53 days. Thus, using a normal trading
week of 4.85 days (to account for occasional holidays), we should, if there is a lunar cycle in
markets, expect a cycle of approximately 20 days in stock market behavior. Does this cycle
exist? Yes, it appears to. See Figure 19.1 for a demonstration of a 20-day cycle in the Standard &
Poor’s 500. Is this cycle related to the phases of the moon? We do not know.

the false accusation that technical analysts are “stargazers.” Extremely few analysts have seri-
ously made any causal connections between the planets, the moon, and the sun and market
prices, and even fewer use that knowledge or presumption to act in the markets. Nevertheless,
there are certain obvious planetary cycles that definitely affect prices if only by affecting supply
and demand in agricultural markets.
The earth circles the sun every 365 days. Do we have an annual or seasonal cycle in mar-
ket prices? Yes, of course, a very well-defined annual cycle exists in agricultural commodity
prices (now being dampened by importation of agricultural products from the southern hemi-
sphere). We also see a seasonal cycle in the stock market. (For more information about seasonal
cycles in the stock market, read Research Driven Investor by Timothy Hayes [McGraw-Hill,
New York, 2000].) Obvious causes for these cycles include change in seasons and weather. Psy-
chologists are also learning about how sun deprivation affects human behavior, not only at differ-
ent latitudes but also at different seasons of the year, and about electromagnetic effects on the
brain. In addition to individual behavior, psychologists are studying crowd mood changes that
might influence the markets.
There are many observed cycles in market prices. Some of them can be explained, or
rationalized, and others cannot. Some, like the “presidential cycle” of four years, are thought to
be synthetic; others are products of nature; and most are unexplained. There are very long-term
cycles like the Kondratieff and Kuznets cycles, and very short-term ones lasting only a few min- ptg
utes.
In terms of the markets, the “business cycle” is not truly a market cycle in the sense that it
does not have a periodic element. However, the business cycle obviously does affect market
prices, and it does have a rough periodicity of four to five years, which in turn can be affected by
market prices in a feedback loop.
The important point in market cycles is that they are not truly harmonics, the mathematical
description of cycles. Instead, they tend to be periodic events or extremes that can be measured
in time but not necessarily in amplitude. Amplitude is a measure of the “strength” of a cycle. In
markets just as in sunspots, amplitude can change and lie dormant for a while. Amplitude is
related to volatility, which we know also fluctuates over time. Harmonic mathematics has not
developed to the point that it can account for this conduct (it assumes a constant amplitude), and
we must often rely more on observation of periodicity alone to gain insight into the cyclical tim-
ing of future market events.
Other curious aspects of market cycles are as follows: (1) They often tend to “nest”
together—especially at turning points, more often at price lows—and when they do, larger
events seem to occur; and (2) they tend to be fractions of larger or multiples of smaller cycles,
usually by a factor of two or three. The latter is termed “harmonic” action, similar to that in
music. These aspects are useful sometimes in projecting market events ahead in time. Finally, the
aspect of “proportionality” suggests that longer cycles tend to have larger amplitudes. This is not
always the case and can often be deceiving. Because amplitude is consistently a projection prob-
lem, the most reliable projections are made strictly on periodicity and phase.
In this chapter, we consider the description and mathematics of cycles, the ways in which
analysts detect cycles, and some methods of profiting from them.

WHAT ARE CYCLES?
In mathematical terms, the cosine (and sine) function describes a cycle. Figure 19.2 shows a
right-angle triangle (one with a 90-degree angle). The side across from the 90-degree angle is the
hypotenuse, labeled (H). A cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
For example, in Figure 19.2, the cosine for angle U is A/H. Thus, for every angle, there is a spe-
cific cosine value.
H
ptg
A
FIGURE 19.2 Triangle and cosine ratio
Within a circle (the unit circle), we can create a triangle from each point along the circle
perimeter. As demonstrated in Figure 19.3, using the radius length of the circle as the hypotenuse
and the length along the horizontal axis to an intersection perpendicular to the perimeter point,
we can calculate the cosine of the angle between each hypotenuse and the axis line for each point
along the perimeter. The cosine value is the ratio of the length along the x-axis (X’) divided by
the radius of the circle. The cosine value will always be one or less because X’ can never be
larger than the radius. As the point works its way around the circle counterclockwise, we can plot
the series of cosine values in another chart with the angle (in radians) along the x-axis and the
cosine value along the y-axis, as shown in Figure 19.4. As you can see in the figure, this results
in a curve with values oscillating between –1 and 1. This curve is known as a cosine wave and is
the basis for calculating the existence of cycles or waves in time series data.

Of course, cycles can have different parameters. They can be long from bottom to bottom,
high and short, and begin from different locations. The location along the cycle of each point can
be defined by the following formula:
f(x) = a x cos(bx + c) + d
Where: a is the amplitude
bx is the period (constant b times x time in radians)
c is the phase (in radians)
d is the error factor
Rather than fully understanding the derivation of cosine waves, it is important to know the
specific variables that determine the waveform. Amplitude is the distance from the horizontal
axis to the extreme peak or trough. In Figure 19.4, it is 1. An amplitude of 2 would result in a
cosine wave twice the height of the cosine waves with an amplitude of 1. Period s the distance
between consecutive lows or consecutive highs. In our usage, the period is the time along the
horizontal axis that it takes for the cycle to return to its original position. Figure 19.5 shows two
cosine waves with different phases. Phase determines how far from the y-axis the particular
cycle begins. It thus determines the offset between two cycles of different phases.

If we know the parameter constants for each variable, we can plot any cosine wave. If there
are multiple cosine waves, we can calculate each and add them together in what is called sum-
mation. James Hurst more thoroughly developed this idea in his book, The Profit Magic of Stock
Transaction Timing (1970). The presumption in markets is that there is no one specific cycle but

Chapter 19 Cycles 455
many cycles that, when summed, form the plot of prices. The forecasting problem then is to
reverse the process and go from the price plot to the cosine formula to determine how many
cosine waves and their parameters exist in the data. From this knowledge, presumably the direc-
tion of prices can be foretold by extrapolating the waves into the future.
Like all theories related to the markets, the theory of cycles is logical but impossible to
quantify, at least with the present level of mathematics. Many methods have been invented to rec-
ognize waves in time series data, but none has been able to duplicate market price sequences with
reliable accuracy. There are many reasons for this, the primary one being that the parameters in
the cosine functions of market prices are not constants. Hurst calls this the principle of
“variation.” Amplitude and period, for example, vary over time. Most mathematical means of
determining cosines from time series data assume that the parameters are constants. This does
not mean that the standard methods of analysis of time series are useless, however. The changes
in parameters appear to take place slowly rather than suddenly. By analyzing prices through con-
ventional cosine analysis over specific but different periods, we can see how the parameters
change. Amplitude appears to change quickly at times, but period appears to change more
slowly. Thus, if we can at least estimate the period with some degree of accuracy, as analysts, we
have a useful indicator. We cannot predict future price levels, but with an estimate of period, we
can potentially predict the timing of future highs and lows.
ptg
Other Aspects of Cycle Analysis
There are several other aspects of cycle analysis of which the technical analysis needs to be
aware. Accuracy concerns exist because cycle periods are indefinite and have error. Cycle trans-
lations and inversions make cycle analysis more difficult. However, due to harmonic properties,
determining one cycle period often leads the analyst to determining cycle periods that are multi-
ples of that initial cycle.
Accuracy
Just because the analysis of financial time series data may suggest cycles exist does not imply
that the cycles are precise. As mentioned earlier, all three aspects of a wave vary over time, and
as wave is added to wave, the errors become large. Because market cycles tend to synchronize at
lows, the estimate of the phase is relatively easy. The analysis just begins at a major price low
where presumably most cycle lows coincide. The estimate of amplitude varies too much for pro-
jection purposes. Amplitude is often called the “power” of the cycle in electronic analysis circles,
where it tends to be a constant in those applications. In the financial world, power can be influ-
enced greatly by exogenous, unpredictable events. The study of amplitude becomes nonproduc-
tive. The third aspect of the cosine wave, the period, often remains relatively constant but can
sometime have large errors. Estimates are based on immediate past price history. As an example,
a 20-day cycle low can occur several days before or after the expected 20 days from the last low,
which itself may have been several days before or after its ideal location. The 20-day cycle, from

456 Part VI Other Technical Methods and Rules
spectral or other analysis, may only be 19.2 days, or it may be 20.4 days. Cycle periods, there-
fore, are indefinite and have error. This means that for investment purposes, all cycles should be
used only as a guide. Even the well-established, seasonal cycle has actual high and low dates that
vary considerably from year to year.
Harmonics
One of the interesting aspects of cycles first observed by Hurst in market data is that cycles tend
to have period lengths a multiple of two or three longer or shorter than the next larger or smaller
cycles. In other words, a cycle of 20 days will indicate that another longer cycle of either 40- or
60-days length exists and that another shorter cycle of 7 or 10 days exists. The longer is either
two times or three times the observed cycle, and the shorter is either 1/3 or 1/2 the observed
cycle. This observation is useful when one specific cycle is determined because it leads the ana-
lyst to what intervals to look for in longer and shorter cycles. Hurst believed that the ratio of two
is more common. Others, such as Tony Plummer (2003), have hypothesized that three is the cor-
rect multiple.
In the April 1987 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities Magazine, Frank
Tarkany compared his analysis of weekly market cycles with that of three other well-known ana-
lysts. Table 19.1 provides a summary of Tarkany’s comparisons. All four of the analysts found
ptg
26-week cycles; this 26-week cycle is the base cycle. These analysts also noticed multiples of 26
weeks, suggesting that an autocorrelation exists between cycle periods. These cycle periods are
called nominal periods because they occur regularly in most financial time series data.

Chapter 19 Cycles 457
Notice that several of the cycles appearing in Table 19.1 are stock market cycles we have
mentioned in previous chapters. The well-known presidential cycle is very dependable, as is the
seasonal cycle. They are both multiples of the 26-week base cycle—the seasonal cycle by two,
and the presidential cycle by eight (or 2 ×2 ×2). Thus, the Hurst hypothesis that cycles tend to
occur in multiples of two or three seems to make sense.
Inversions
One of the most difficult observations for the analyst to face is the inversion. Occasionally,
where a cycle low is expected, a peak occurs instead. For example, look at Figure 19.1. Where
we would be expecting to see the second 20-day low, we actually see a high in this chart. This is
an example of an inversion. No satisfactory explanation has been given for its existence, but sev-
eral observations have been noted.
Inversions can occur at either peaks or troughs, but most often occur at peaks in harmonic
cycles when the next longer cycle is at a peak. This make sense only if the next higher order cycle
is a multiple of two. For example, a cycle of 20 days should make a low every 20 days. If the next
higher order cycle is 40 days, synchronous with the 20-day cycle, and peaking, a 40-day peak
ideally should occur just as a 20-day cycle is making a low. Thus, the 20-day cycle low is masked
by the peaking of the 40-day cycle and is often difficult to decipher. When this occurs, the
ptg
inverted cycle low often has just a small very short-term “dip” within the peak of the higher order
cycle. This dip resembles an M where the small low between the two small peaks is the actual
cycle low that is being overcome by the longer cycle. Proof of the low coinciding with the
longer-cycle high occurs when the subsequent decline breaks below the dip. If a longer cycle is
due to peak, this is the sign that its declining portion has begun.
Previously we noted that cycles are not strict harmonics but specific time-separated events.
The habit of producing lows at constant intervals can be interspersed with highs at the same
intervals because both are important market events. Thus, a long string of events occurring at
specific intervals that is primarily dominated by low events but interspersed with occasional high
events at the same periodic times can look like a harmonic wave for the period that the lows are
occurring but be confusing from a cyclical standpoint. However, the progression is only a time
sequence of events. Analysts thus assume inversions are anomalies within a harmonic-type wave
when the wave is actually an event wave, not a true mathematically defined cycle.
TRANSLATION
The reason that we study lows in cycle analysis is because longer and shorter cycles tend to syn-
chronize at lows. Peaks, on the other hand, almost never synchronize. Peaks, ideally, should
occur at the halfway period of the cycle. A 20-day cycle, for example, should have a peak 10
days from its last low. This rarely occurs. Peaks can occur earlier or later than the halfway point.
Their location away from the center point is called translation. A right translation in a cycle is
when the peak is beyond the halfway point, and a left translation is when the cycle peak occurs
before the halfway point. Usually, the underlying trend from a longer cycle determines the
amount of translation in the shorter cycle. In Chapter 12, “Trends—The Basics,” we noticed that
trend directions determined the shape of the corrective trends. In an uptrend, for example, the

==================================================

458 Part VI Other Technical Methods and Rules
upward trends were long and the corrections were short. These were translating right because the
peaks were beyond the halfway point between the lows. If the peak had occurred at the halfway
point, we would be suspicious about the continuation of the upward trend. Because cycles are
nested and synchronous, the shorter cycle is dominated by the trend of the next longer cycle.
Again, let us look at Figure 19.1. The first marked low (in early February) is both a 20-day
and a higher order cycle low. From that point on for more than two cycles, the trend is sharply
upward. This upward strength of the longer cycle is influencing where the peak for the first, sec-
ond, and third 20-day cycles will occur. As it is, the peak for the first cycle is past the midpoint
of the 20-week cycle period. In the second 20-day cycle, the peak is even farther to the right of
its midpoint, suggesting that the trend is becoming even steeper. This movement of the actual
peak beyond the midpoint of the cycle is called right translation and is characteristic of all peaks
when dominated by the strength of a longer, rising trend.
In the 20-day cycle beginning in May during the decline in prices, the peak to the cycle is
only four days after the low. This cycle is left translated.
The diminution of “rightness” or “leftness” suggests that the higher order cycle is also
beginning to change direction. Translation is, thus, useful in checking where the overlying
longer-term cycle trend direction is headed or if it is changing direction.

HOW CAN CYCLES BE FOUND IN MARKET DATA?
Conventional wave-filtering mathematics has gone through tremendous growth and development
in the past 50 years. Data transmission, voice and image transmission, electronic signaling, and
other developments in the electronic age necessitated more sophisticated mathematics to recog-
nize and understand waveforms. Now we have bandpass filters, digital signal processing (DSP),
wavelet modeling, nonlinear spectral analysis, higher order spectral analysis (HOSA), and deriv-
atives of each. For our purposes, however, this sophistication is unnecessary. Because waveforms
in prices, if they exist, are not based on constant parameters, we need only to make initial esti-
mates of a cycle period to satisfy our requirements. Once we have an estimate of period, we have
information that is useful for projection and useful for determining the “window” or moving
average length in indicators that best represents the trading period of interest.
Fourier Analysis (Spectral Analysis)
The most common and simplest method of wave analysis in a time series data is Fourier analy-
sis. Fourier analysis, available in most mathematics software programs, has many variations. It
has specific problems, however, in that it requires a large amount of data. For market forecasting,
the more data that is involved, the more the waves can change and neutralize the calculations of
parameters. Thus, Fourier analysis should be used only as a basic method of analyzing cycles in
market time series data. A faster method, called Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), reduces the
computation time of the analysis. A second problem with Fourier analysis is that it does not
maintain the phase relationships between cycles. In other words, if one cycle crosses the horizon-
tal axis after or before another, the difference in these phases is not recorded. This makes projec-
tion of the combination of the cycles very difficult. Figure 19.6 displays an example of spectral
analysis.

Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis
In the early 1980s, John Ehlers (2002) developed a method that attempts to solve the problems of
Fourier analysis without compromising the accuracy of the results. His method, Maximum
Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA), is available through his software company, MESA Software.
The method requires only a short time series to determine the inherent cycles in the data. It deter-
mines the most recent and most relevant waves for projection and records the different phases of
each cycle recognized.
Simpler (and More Practical) Methods
Fourier analysis and MESA provide methods for determining cycles but depend upon complex
mathematics. Often, simpler tools, such as detrending, envelopes, or centered moving averages,
can help identify cycles. At times, even the naked eye can observe cycles without the aid of com-
plicated mathematics and sophisticated computer software.

Observation
In many cases, the low points of dominant cycles in market data are obvious to the eye. The exact
cyclical low can often be difficult to determine, but the general oscillation of the cycle is plain. In
his book, The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing, Hurst, the father of cycle analysis in the
stock market, used a method of envelopes that he traced along the major highs and lows in a price
chart. These envelopes were not predetermined like a filter but were drawn freehand on the chart.
When prices touched the upper and lower edges of the band, Hurst drew an arrow at the bottom
of the price chart for later inspection. When he was done with the freehand estimates, he looked
at the arrows drawn and determined if any obvious stable period separated the arrows. Figure
19.7 shows what this hand-drawn method might look like.

Of course, such methods are fraught with danger. The human mind often imagines cycles
where they do not exist or invents turning points to fit a preconceived notion of an existing cycle.
Hurst’s method was just the beginning observation of the potential for cycles in financial data. If
it appeared reasonable that cycles existed in the data, he would then use more sophisticated
methods, such as Fourier analysis and moving averages, to find the specifics.
Oscillators are another method of determining with the eye if cycles exist in financial data.
Many of the indicators in Chapter 18, “Confirmation,” show oscillations about a central horizon-
tal line. By observing the lows especially, because cycles tend to synchronize at lows, one can

Chapter 19 Cycles 461
observe if the times separating each low are at regular intervals. If so, a cycle is suspected to exist
in the data.
If a cycle is suspected, one way of quantifying it more accurately is to mark a dot on the
bottom of the chart page just below each low. Then, using a blank piece of paper, mark a line on
the edge of the paper, move the paper such that the line is placed on the first dot on the chart, and
draw another line on the paper at the point where the next dot lies. This gives a measured dis-
tance between the two dots on the paper. Then move the first paper line to the second dot and
draw a line on the paper where the third dot occurs on the chart. This second line should be near
the earlier line for the second dot but is rarely exactly on it. Now two cycle lengths have been
measured, and the difference in period can be seen immediately. Continue to move the paper
across the dots, making lines to mark the length between each subsequent cycle bottom. When
you’re done, the paper will show the range of periods between dots and thus give an estimate of
the cycle period. By placing the first line on the last dot, the range of lines from previous cycles
will give an estimate of the range in which to expect the next cyclical bottom.
The eyeball measurement of cycle lengths can also be done with a ruler or a drafting
divider. In this case, the distance between the first and second dot is measured and recorded; then
the distance between the second and third dot is measured and recorded; and so on. Once
imported into a spreadsheet, the mean, standard deviation, and other statistical measures can be
determined for all the intervals. ptg
Detrending
Because specific cycle behavior is highly dependent on the direction of the next higher order
cycle, the first step in recognizing if a cycle exists in the data is to “detrend” it. Detrending is
done merely by dividing the current prices by a moving average of those prices. The resulting
plot will oscillate above and below a zero line, and the lows of the plot will correspond to the
lows in the cycle being analyzed.
Figure 19.8 shows an example of this detrending method. The detrended line is constructed
by dividing the current closing price by an 11-day SMA. The cycle with a 35-day period (slightly
shorter than the ideal 40 days) shows up clearly in the plot.
As a further example, Figure 19.9 shows detrending using a six-day SMA, roughly half the
length of the SMA used in Figure 19.8. The plot in Figure 19.9 shows more clearly the cycle
lows 18 days apart, the half-cycle of the 35-day cycle shown in Figure 19.8.
When prices are detrended using the daily closing price as the numerator, especially as we
lengthen the denominator, the plot becomes very erratic and difficult to interpret. The solution is
to use a moving average in the numerator as well, but this presents some problems that must first
be addressed.

Centered Moving Averages
…the time relationship between the moving average and the data it smoothes is not
the one that is always shown on stock price charts. In fact, the moving average data
point plotted in association with the last price datum should be associated with price
datum one-half the time span of the average in the past. (Hurst, 1970, p. 65)
What Hurst was saying is that a moving average is an average of both price and time. Most plots
take into account the average in price but incorrectly plot that average at the time the last price of
the average occurs. For example, an 11-day moving average of prices of Days 1–11 is frequently
plotted at Day 11. Instead, because the moving average is also an average of the time over which
the average price occurred, it should be plotted at the mean point or center of the time span of the
average. In other words, the moving average of Days 1–11 should be plotted at Day 6. This plot
is called a centered moving average. Figure 19.10 shows an 11-day centered moving average
versus an 11-day moving average plotted the usual way. We use a centered moving average for
the remainder of our discussion on cycles.

becomes even more noticeable as the moving average span increases. The centered moving aver-
age plot is a better representation of prices but, of course, lags behind prices and by itself cannot
be used as a signaling method. It is used to identify cycles but not to predict them.
Envelopes
As we saw in Figure 19.7, Hurst used a hand-drawn envelope about prices to get a rough estimate
of the potential cycle period in the price data. Once that period could be estimated, he used mov-
ing averages to quantify the cycle more definitively.
Moving averages dampen or smooth data. In terms of cycles, a moving average represents
price oscillations greater than the period of the moving average and effectively cancels out price
action or oscillations less than the moving average period. Figure 19.11 includes a centered 35-
day moving average overlay. The large price deviations below and above the moving average
appear roughly 40 days apart. To quantify the range of price movement about this moving aver-
age, we draw an envelope parallel with the moving average. Notice that prices touch the lower
envelope band about every 35 days.

The next step is to draw a half-cycle centered moving average with an envelope, as shown
in Figure 19.12. A half-cycle moving average in this example is 18 days. This moving average
smoothes out all waves shorter than 18 days and includes waves 18 days or longer. When sub-
tracted from the 35-day moving average, it reflects the waves that exist between 18 and 35 days,
or the 35-day cycle we are investigating.

The points at which the 18-day envelope touches, or comes close to, the 35-day envelope
and turns upward are the low points of the 35-day cycle. It is pure chance that the analysis results
in exactly 35 days. Normally it would be close but not exact. To be more confident of the cycli-
cality, we should use a minimum of seven examples. We now have a well-defined 35-day cycle,
and we know the days on which it bottomed and turned upward. When we later discuss the pro-
jection of cycles, we will use this data to predict when the next 35-day cycle should occur in the
future.

Somehow we have lost precision with envelopes. This is likely because higher-order
cycles are trending so strongly that the shorter cycles are being dampened out. To counter this,
we return to the detrending method. Because we want to pinpoint the 35-day cycle and cycle of
lesser period, we detrend the price data by plotting a line of the ratio of a 5-day SMA to the 18-
day. We use the 5-day to smooth out short-term daily fluctuations and the 18-day because it
should represent cycles above 18 days, namely the 35-day.
Figure 19.13 shows this detrended line with the 35-day lows clearly marked by the vertical
lines exactly 35 days apart. On every line, with the exception of the inversion in May where the
line peaks, a slight valley occurs that represents the 35-day low. This is fairly conclusive evi-
dence that a periodicity of 35 days exists in the price data.

FIGURE 19.13 Detrending using a 5-day SMA to 18-day SMA ratio (X daily: November 30,
2000–July 22, 2010)
Let us go down one more period and see if any cycle appears less than 35 days. We suspect,
from Figure 19.9, the detrending exercise, that an 18-day cycle exists, but we cannot pinpoint it
because we did not use a centered moving average. Remember that a moving average of roughly
half the period of a cycle represents that cycle. Now we will calculate a detrended line based on
the 18-day SMA which should represent the 35-day cycle and all others longer. It will screen out
the motion from those longer cycle and give us more precise data for any shorter cycle than 35
days. Figure 19.14 is a plot of the ratio of the closing price to the 18-day centered SMA.
Visual inspection of Figure 19.14 shows vertical dashed lines at exact 18-day intervals
beginning at the major low in February. At each of the nine dashed lines, a dip in the ratio shows
that a cycle low of some nature occurred within one day of each vertical line. The one exception
out of the nine shown is the inversion in late May and even on this line there is the slight dip of
the M pattern mentioned earlier as common at inversion highs. We now have some convincing
evidence that an event, usually a low, occurs in U.S. Steel stock every 18 and 35 days.
We also notice that the phase of the short cycle is out of synchronization with the 35-day
cycle. This is why the actual lows in the 35-day cycles are rounded rather than sharp. If the two
cycles synchronized at the lows, they would bottom at the same time and create a “V” type bot-
tom pattern.

The process we just went through of deducing the cycles shorter than a known dominant
cycle is called “nesting downward.” We could equally as well have nested upward by again tak-
ing the dominant cycle of 35 days and deducing cycles with longer periods. This would have
taken considerably more data, but it is an exercise that should be done before any trading or
investing is initiated using cyclical data. When investors decide upon the period of investment,
they should understand at least the next longer and shorter cycle period because these cycles will
affect the behavior of the cycle of interest. In addition, the analysis should be repeated every time
a cycle has completed just to be sure that the original assumptions as to cycle periods are still
correct.
The preceding analysis, and all of the analysis in this chapter, can be used in any time
series data regardless of the bar interval—daily, weekly, monthly, or minute-by-minute. How-
ever, as explained in Chapter 14, “Moving Averages,” analysis of cycles shorter than a day must
be limited to securities that trade over the complete 24 hours because the data that is shorter than
daily does not account for the time between the close of one day and the open of the next day.
PROJECTIONS
We have looked at methods to determine cycles in market data. We now look at how we can use
the knowledge about cycles in the data to project the next low and perhaps the next high.

468 Part VI Other Technical Methods and Rules
Projecting Period
To project the time for the next low, we need three facts: the period length of the cycle of inter-
est, the standard error of that cycle, and the ideal starting point from which to measure it into the
future. In the example, we have found periods of 35 days and 18 days. Because we only have
four cycles of the 35-day period, we cannot determine accurate projections. However, for the 18-
day cycle, we have plenty of examples with apparently little error.
The first and most simple method is to use a ruler or the paper trick mentioned previously
to draw points on the chart that match the periods determined from measurement. This is subject
to interpretive error; in our example, the process suggested an 18-day cycle that was not borne
out by further analysis.
Second, we could use the vertical line shown on the charts and project into the future. This
method is accurate once we know the precise cycle periods from our analysis and the beginning
point. However, it does not estimate an error range of when to expect the next turning point.
Third, we could use a linear regression model of the periods to estimate the period, the
error, and the exact location for the starting point (Kirkpatrick, 1990). To begin this process, we
identify the lows given by the ratio in Figure 19.14, beginning numbering with 1. Thus, the first
low, which occurred on December 8, 2010, would be 1; the second low, occurring on December
31, would be 2; and so forth. Table 19.2 displays this numbering of lows under the Number col- ptg
umn heading.
In addition, each time interval is converted to a sequence of whole numbers to eliminate
the problem of weekends and to make calculation easier. In our example, for instance, the first
18-day low occurred on December 8. We record that as low Number 1 at time interval 0 because
it is the beginning of our period. The next low occurred on December 31. Because this low
occurred 16 trading days after low Number 1, we would label it low Number 2 and with a day
number 16 days, in other words it occurred 16 days after low Number 1. From now on, all days
will be measured from low Number 1. The third low occurred on January 29. We would label it
low Number 3 with a period of 35 days from low Number 1. The time interval for all lows is
measured from the first low. Successive lows are entered into the spreadsheet in a similar manner
until the end of the period is reached, as shown in Table 19.2.
This process creates two columns in the spreadsheet. The first, the low’s specific number,
is the independent variable (second column in Table 19.2). The second, the low’s corresponding
period number, is the dependent variable (fourth column in Table 19.2).

We then use linear regression to determine a best fit between the cycle number and the time
interval on which it occurred. The results of the linear regression suggest that the cycle period is
17.738 days, roughly 18 days, and is very reliable with an R square so close to one.
Using these numbers, we can project future lows. The best projection into the future is for
ptg
the next 18-day low (Number 9) to occur 17.738 days after the model’s estimate of the eighth
low. As illustrated in Figure 19.15, this suggests a Number 9 projected low will occur at time
interval 158, or on July 28, and the Number 10 projected low will occur on August 23 plus or
minus a day or so. As it turns out, the longer 35-day cycle is due for a low around August 25.

Projecting Amplitude
Figure 19.14 also shows how amplitude can vary enormously. Indeed, the variation is so large
that prediction is almost impossible. We can only conjecture what the future might bring in
amplitude because, so far, no reasonable and consistent method exists. In this example, what can
help in amplitude projection, however, is the concept of nesting. Cycles tend to oscillate within
cycles. Thus, their outer boundaries, as defined by envelopes, can give us a rough estimate of
what to expect for amplitude. Again, let us look at our same data example, this time shown in
Figure 19.16 with a 35-day cycle envelope.
We project the next cycle lows using the linear regression method outlined previously. This
gives us an idea as to when to expect cycle lows and, by inference, cycle highs. We know that the
low around early July is a 35-day low. Because the envelope is bending upward, we also know
that the July low is likely one of a larger cycle that is influencing the shorter cycles. It is, there-
fore, a powerful low, and we can expect the immediately following cycles to translate right.
Right translation has already occurred in the first 18-day cycle and will likely occur in the first
35-day cycle. Because of the right translation, the peak in the 35-day cycle will likely occur dur-
ing the second 18-day cycle, sometime in August.

Half-Cycle Reversal
We mentioned earlier that the half-cycle, centered, moving average represents the full cycle
under investigation. When the half-cycle, centered, SMA reverses, it signals that the low in the
cycle of interest has occurred. Because the half-cycle, centered, moving average is plotted half
its cycle back from the present, it represents what the full cycle was doing 1/4 of a cycle length

back. If the full cycle was bottoming as represented by the centered moving average, we know
that the full cycle still has 3/4 of its time and perhaps distance to travel. An ideal cycle will spend
half its time rising and half its time declining. At 1/4 the time through the cycle we know that it
has another 1/4 to go before showing signs of downward reversal. It is, thus, halfway through its
advance. Being so, we can take the distance that it has traveled and assume that the price will
approximately double what it did during the first quarter. We now have an estimate of the poten-
tial amplitude of the current full cycle. Of course, the amplitude also depends on the next higher
order cycle. If that longer cycle is rising, we can assume the projection will be exceeded as the
cycle translates to the right, and if the next higher is downward, we likely will not see an upward
reversal in the centered moving average. If the next higher cycle is flat, the projection should be
precise. The bottom line, then, is when one-quarter of a cycle is completed, we can begin to see
what the potential shape of the full cycle will be from looking at the behavior of the half-cycle,
centered moving average.
The FLD and Centered Moving Average Crossovers (The “Forward Line”)
Hurst describes another interesting method of projecting prices in a cycle called the FLD line.
FLD stands for “Future Line of Demarcation.” It is the closing prices projected a half-cycle
period forward from the current price. In Figure 19.17, for example, the cycle of interest is the
ptg
35-day cycle. Projecting closing prices a half-cycle forward, or 18 days, produces the FLD line.
Several observations can be made.
First, because the projection is a half-cycle forward, its peak should appear when a low is
expected and vice versa. This is because prices should rise during the first half into a cycle meas-
ured from the cycle low and should decline during the second half. Thus, the FLD high should
occur at the same time as the real cycle low and vice versa. Of course, this can be upset by the
influence of the next longer cycle. If prices peak after the low in the FLD, or bottom before the
top in the FLD, the underlying trend is upward. Conversely, if prices bottom after the FLD peak
or peak before the FLD peak, the underlying trend is downward. The location of the FLD can,
thus, help us with determining the trend of the next longer cycle.
In Figure 19.17, in February, the peak in the FLD and the bottom in prices coincide pre-
cisely. In March, when a price peak is suggested by the bottoming of the FLD, prices continue
higher, suggesting that the underlying trend is strong and likely to cause price to rise further. In
early May, prices pay no attention to the FLD peak and continue downward, suggesting that by
the next cycle low, prices will be considerably lower.
Second, by representing a half-cycle, the FLD line is declining when the cycle prices are
advancing. The crossover of current prices through the FLD should occur at roughly the mid-
point both time wise and pricewise in the advance or decline. In Figure 19.17, the downward
crossover of prices through the FLD in February at $54.68 projected a decline of $10.66 to an
estimated target of $44.02. The bottom closing price at the actual low was $44.07, only 4 cents
different. In late February, prices crossed the FLD continued far beyond their projected midpoint
target. This is evidence that the prior low was that from a higher-order cycle. In April, prices
crossed the forward line and continued lower, telling us that the longer cycle beginning in Febru-
ary was over. From the 35-day cycle, the timing for the low was easily projected. The rule, then,
is that when prices exceed the FLD target price after the crossover, the next higher-order cycle is
strong in the direction of the price crossover. Conversely, if prices do not reach their target, or as
in some cases, do not cross the FLD line, the next higher-order cycle is weak.

Third, the FLD can act as support or resistance. Notice in Figure 19.17 during the decline
from April to July how many times the price touched the FLD and then reversed. This gives an
example of how prices can come close to the FLD, after a cycle low or high, stop for a few bars,
and either penetrate the FLD or reverse direction and fail. Thus, the FLD is an important point to
watch. If prices halt at the FLD and reverse, the underlying cycle trend is not reversing on sched-
ule. It will increase in strength in its original direction. If prices penetrate the FLD, the cycle is
still intact, and prices will head for the midpoint target. Depending on whether it reaches that tar-
get or overruns it will then give clues as to the strength of the next longer cycle trend. It is, there-
fore, very important to watch price action when it reaches the FLD to see if it is confirming the
strength or weakness of the cycle direction.
In sum, the FLD can be a useful projection device.

Because the FLD line follows price action exactly, it can give an erratic appearance and
make crossovers somewhat arbitrary, based on only one or two days action. To combat this, ana-
lysts will project forward the half-cycle SMA in the same manner as the FLD. This gives a
smoothed line, called the forward line that is easier to work with. The same rules for the FLD
apply to the forward line.
The Tillman Method
Jim Tillman (1990) of Cycletrend, Inc., developed a number of methods for cycle projections.
He used centered moving averages of half-cycles after having determined the dominant cycle
periods.

Tillman’s analysis concentrates on what he calls focal points. Focal points occur when
three or more half-cycle, centered, moving averages cross at roughly the same location. In Figure
19.18, only crossovers of two half-cycle moving averages (9-day and 18-day) are shown, but
Tillman’s observations can still be made.

FIGURE 19.18 Tillman SMA crossovers and focal points (X daily: November 30, 2009–July 22,

One observation is that focal points occur at roughly the halfway point of cycle advances
or declines. Notice the diagonal lines at the 18-day cycle peaks, troughs, and crossovers in Fig-
ure 19.18. The crossovers occur roughly halfway between the peak and trough in points. The
practical problem from this observation is that by the time the lagging half-cycle moving aver-
ages have crossed, prices have usually already reached their projection. The crossover, thus,
occurs when the cycle is ending its run up or down. When you see a crossover in an upward leg
of a cycle, you know that the upward leg is about to peak or already has.
In Figure 19.19, at (A), lines are drawn through the high or low of a cycle through the focal
point. The upward sloping lines will continue through to the high of the cycle, and the downward
sloping lines will continue through to the low of the cycle. The time from the low (high) to the
focal point will equal, approximately, the time to that high (low). In our example in Figure 19.19,
in January, the time from the cycle high to the focal point was 9 days, and 9 days later, the low
was reached. In February–March, the rally through the focal point took 12 days. The price
reached its high for the cycle 14 days. The crossover is the center of the cosine wave. It is the
center in time as well as distance.

If we then draw a trend line between two successive focal points (B), we have an estimate
of the direction of the next higher-order cycle. Lines drawn parallel to that trend line to the
immediate highs and lows will show that the trend is roughly midway between the parallel lines
and that they represent the boundaries of the cycle (see Figure 19.19). The advantage of using
these parallel lines formed from the trend between focal points is that they can be projected into
the future, whereas the moving average parallel lines had to be drawn freehand as a guess.
When the parallel lines are decisively broken, we know that the next higher-order cycle has
changed direction. This makes sense because the parallel lines define the boundaries of the
lower-order cycle. If they are broken, it must be due to the change in direction of the next higher-
order cycle.
Concept of Commonality
Another of Hurst’s principles, that of “commonality,” suggested that issues of the same nature
tend to have the same cycles but with different amplitudes. In the stock market, this principle
implies that individual stocks will have generally the same cycles as the stock market averages.
The study of cycles requires the analyst’s close attention and analysis. Few analysts pursue it
because the conversion of the analysis to computers is difficult and requires some knowledge of

applied mathematics and trigonometry. Much of the analysis must be done by hand. Because
cycle analysis is intensive and very subjective, the analyst must select stocks with sufficient
volatility such that the cycles of interest will have enough amplitude to become profitable if cor-
rectly timed. The same can be said of commodities in that innate volatility is a factor that should
be considered when selecting an issue to trade using cycle analysis.
CONCLUSION
The possible existence of cycles or waves in financial time series data is a controversial subject
that remains unresolved. The results of standard spectral methods have been unsuccessful, so far,
in isolating reliable waveforms in this data. This has led many skeptics to argue that the pursuit
of cycles in financial data is futile. On the other hand, cycle analysts argue that the reason cycles
have not been definitively isolated is that they change their characteristics too frequently and that
standard mathematics cannot adjust quickly enough. However, a simple observation of price data
shows that prices oscillate. If prices oscillate in a regular manner, the preceding analysis should
be sufficient to identify this regularity and to make it useful for the projection of price action in
the future. The concepts of Hurst, Ehlers, Tillman, and others—mostly professional engineers—

are intriguing, and even if the ideas are difficult to apply, they provide interesting insights into
the workings of the financial markets.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with
• The basic tenets of and vocabulary used with the Elliott Wave Theory ptg

• The derivation and characteristics of the golden ratio
• The reasons why Elliott Wave Theory can be difficult for the average analyst to apply
Perhaps there is a natural structure in markets. Structure is seen in many phenomena in nature.
Although markets appear to be completely man-made, perhaps their existence, flowing from
human emotion and reason, is a product of evolution and follows a natural order. After all, nature
includes humans among its species. Humans like structure. Unfortunately, however, we have
seen that humans tend to presume structure when perhaps it is not present. This chapter discusses
those theories of market structure that assume some sort of natural order. Many technical ana-
lysts have come to accept these theories at some level, but they are not necessarily practiced.
The most widely followed theory of market structure today is the Elliott Wave Theory. We
look at this theory and some of its interpretations. We also look at the mathematical basis for this
theory derived from a sequence of whole numbers called the Fibonacci sequence. In addition, we
consider briefly another theory of market structure by W. D. Gann.
ELLIOTT WAVE THEORY (EWT)
Devised by Ralph Nelson Elliott, the Elliott Wave Theory (EWT) is an attempt to define a struc-
ture to the stock market, and by implication, other trading markets. EWT is based upon the

notion that the market behaves in an irregular cyclic manner. Proponents of EWT believe that
this cyclic structure is classifiable and predictable. Defining the market structure allows the ana-
lyst to recognize where the market is within the structure and, from that, where it is proceeding
next.
Because Elliott’s theory defies any strict, mathematical description, except through anec-
dotal evidence, its existence is difficult to prove conclusively. Thus, even among practitioners of
the Elliott Wave Theory, there is much disagreement about the “where are we” aspect of the the-
ory. The basic rules are generally agreed upon, but because of the vagaries of interpretation, no
agreement or consensus seems to arise as to present conditions.
In this chapter, we outline the basics of the theory, as espoused by Robert Prechter (1990),
the principal proponent of the EWT. We also provide some alternate rules, when known, from
some of the other leaders in the field and include some results from computer screening. How-
ever, we leave the interpretation and much detail to further study by the student. EWT is a com-
plex subject and deserves some thought, even if a practical application can be elusive.
Ralph Nelson Elliott
Born in 1871, Ralph Nelson Elliott spent most of his business career as a railroad accountant and
reorganizer in Central America. After 25 years in the railroad business, he contracted a severe ill- ptg
ness and was forced into retirement to recover. During his recovery, Elliott decided to study the
stock market, having earlier subscribed to several market letters, one by Charles Collins and the
other by Robert Rhea of Dow Theory fame. At the age of 63, he began his career as a stock mar-
ket technical analyst, studying the Dow Jones Averages over periods from half-hours to months.
His initial discovery of the wave principle took place in early 1934. Becoming destitute,
Elliott wrote to Collins asking for an arrangement by which he could be paid for market fore-
casts. Collins allowed him to write to him of his opinions on the market at that time, and Elliott
was amazingly correct, calling several major market turns within the hour. In 1938, Collins pub-
lished the first book on the Elliott wave called The Wave Principle.
In the late 1930s, Elliott moved to New York and with Collins’ financial assistance and
investor referrals, began his business of newsletters, consulting, and money management. By
now, Elliott was familiar with the Fibonacci sequence and had integrated it into his wave theory.
Later in life, he wrote about all his discoveries in Nature’s Law—The Secret of the Universe, but
his advancing age affected his writing, and the book became disjointed and rambling. Elliott died
in New York in 1948. Richard Martin, a former student of Collins, Hamilton Bolton, the pub-
lisher of the Bank Credit Analyst, and Bolton’s business associate A. J. Frost were well-known
for applying Elliott’s theory after his death. Robert Prechter, a notable scholar of Elliott’s theory,
has published all his works, including magazine articles, in The Major Works of R. N. Elliott
(1980).
Basic Elliott Wave Theory
Elliott’s theory describes the market structure as a nested series of waves of various length and
size. A wave is a sustained price move in one direction as determined by the reversal points that
initiated and terminated the move. A wave cycle is composed of two waves—an impulse wave

and a corrective wave. The impulse wave is in the direction of the current trend; the corrective
wave moves against the trend’s direction. During a bull market, the overall trend is called a
motive impulse wave (upward price movement) and ends when a downtrend begins, signaling a
major change in market direction.
The wave concept that a market has positive price movement followed by a correction is
simple. The benefit of EWT is that it provides the analyst with more detail about these waves.
Both the impulse wave and corrective waves include special subwaves. The impulse wave is
always made up of five subwaves and determines the strength and trend of the wave cycle. Ana-
lysts traditionally label these waves with numbers (1, 2, 3, or I, II, III, or i, ii, iii, etc.) based on
their degree relative to longer and shorter wave cycles. See waves 1 through 5, for example, in
Figure 20.1. Waves 1, 3, and 5 are smaller waves that contribute to the larger wave’s upward
trend. Waves 2 and 4 are corrective subwaves; these corrective waves break the sustained upward
movement.
The corrective wave is broken into three subwaves, rather than five. These subwaves are
labeled with letters, such as A, B, and C, as shown in Figure 20.1. Waves A and C are associated
with downward price movement. Wave B breaks this downward movement with an uptrend.
In describing the specific subwaves, analysts assume an upward underlying trend at the
next higher degree and, thus, a rising five-wave impulse wave and a declining three-wave correc-
tive wave. We use the same convention, but the student must be aware that in an underlying ptg
downward trend, the same relationship between impulse wave and corrective wave holds, just in
the opposite direction. In other words, the downward impulse wave would include five subwaves
and three subwaves in its corrective wave upward.
Look at Figure 20.1. See how the upward motive impulse wave consists of three rising
impulse subwaves, coinciding with the primary trend, and the corrective wave consists of two
corrective subwaves, contrary to the primary trend. This pattern can be thought of as three steps
forward and two steps backward, with each step followed by a small correction.
Figure 20.1 demonstrates how the two waves of the cycle, the impulse and corrective
waves, can be broken down into smaller subwaves. Each of these subwaves can be broken into
separate patterns. Interestingly, the patterns of each subwave will form the same general impulse
and corrective Elliott pattern with and against their trend. In other words, the patterns generated
from the waves are fractal, a term we used earlier in describing how chart patterns of a specific
type can exist in identical shapes in very short- as well as long-term charts. The patterns remain
the same regardless of time or scale. Each series of waves will define a pattern within a pattern
both up and down the scale.
Unfortunately, the patterns do not have definitive time limits. One of the major problems of
the interpretation of Elliott waves is in deciding at what degree level a particular pattern exists.
Often the shape of the wave can be interpreted as being part of one degree of magnitude of
waves, when it really is part of a larger or smaller degree of waves. These different interpreta-
tions might have different implied consequences, making projections even more difficult.
To establish the order of the waves being analyzed, analysts generally begin with a long-
term interpretation and reduce the inspection of waves through lower and lower degrees until the
trading horizon is reached. Misinterpreting any of the waves between the long-term pattern and
the trading horizon pattern, of course, can alter the interpretation of future prospects as well.

FIGURE 20.1 The structure of ideal Elliott waves within an upward motive impulse wave
Each of the subwaves within either the impulse or the corrective waves can have its own
peculiarities and alternative patterns. First, let us look a little more closely at the characteristics
of impulse waves. Then we turn our attention to corrective waves.
Impulse Waves
Each impulse wave is composed of five subwaves. This impulse wave defines both the trend
direction and the trend strength. Let’s consider the basic, inviolate rules of these of these waves
and some of the patterns that can develop.
Basic Rules
There are several rules regarding the characteristics of waves. These rules are inviolate. To vio-
late a rule is to disregard the Elliott Wave Theory and, almost certainly, to arrive at an incorrect
conclusion and projection. Although there are not many rules, it is important to remember that
they are strict rules that cannot be violated.
The six rules for impulse waves are as follows:
• Impulse waves move in the same direction as the trend of the next higher degree wave.
• Impulse waves divide into five subwaves.

• Within an impulse wave, subwaves 1, 3, and 5 are themselves impulse waves of a
lesser degree, and subwaves 2 and 4 are corrective waves.
• Within an impulse wave, subwave 1 and 5 might be either an impulse or diagonal pat-
tern.
• Within an impulse wave, subwave 3 is always an impulse pattern.
• In cash markets, within an impulse pattern, subwave 4 never overlaps any portion of
subwave 1. This is not always true for futures markets.
In addition to the inviolate rules, Elliott observed other wave characteristics that routinely
occurred. Elliott’s observations were made without the advantage of computer power to sift
through large amounts of data, and he used only the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The observa-
tions we include in this chapter are observations from computer screens of price action in many
different trading markets and over many different periods (Swannell, 2003). Most of these obser-
vations agree with Elliott’s assessments, but some differ slightly. Nevertheless, the computer
screens display that his observations were mostly accurate.
Impulse
ptg
Impulse patterns define the trend direction and strength. They include five subwaves, three of
which move in the direction of the trend and two of which move in the direction opposite to the
trend. A rising market generally has two strong subwaves: 3 and 5. In a declining market, sub-
wave 3 is generally the strongest, and subwaves 1 and 5 are approximately equal.
Elliott Wave Theory describes the character of each subwave in more detail. The details of
these subwaves are as follows:
• Wave 1 is an impulse or a leading diagonal.
• Wave 2 can be any corrective pattern but a triangle.
• Wave 2 does not retrace more than 100% of wave 1.
• Wave 3 is always an impulse.
• Wave 3 is larger than wave 2.
• Wave 3 is never shorter than waves 1 and 5.
• Wave 4 can be any corrective pattern.
• Waves 2 and 4 do not overlap in price.
• Wave 5 is an impulse or ending diagonal.
• Wave 5 retraces at least 70% of wave 4.
• In wave 5, a diagonal, extension, or truncation indicates that a major reversal is to
occur soon.

482 Part VI Other Technical Methods and Rules
Diagonals
A diagonal (see Figure 20.2) is the same as the classic wedge pattern seen in classic technical
patterns. It is simply a triangle formation with both bounds headed in the same direction but at
different angles so that they will meet at some point in the future.
Diagonal patterns can appear in wave 1 or wave 5. If a diagonal appears in wave 1, it is
called a leading diagonal. A diagonal appearing in wave 5 is called an ending diagonal. A diag-
onal never occurs in wave 3. The direction of the diagonal bounds is the same direction as the
trend of the higher-degree impulse wave.
A leading diagonal usually consists of five subwaves of three wavelets, each a 3-3-3-3-3
configuration converging toward an apex. Occasionally, however, the configuration is 5-3-5-3-5,
just as in an impulse but with the overlapping of waves 2 and 4 (Frost and Prechter, 2000).
An ending diagonal also includes five subwaves, each of which is in turn subdivided into
three smaller waves. Often, the fifth subwave will break out of the diagonal’s bounds for a short
period before reversing. This is called a throw-over (Frost and Prechter, 2000).
A throw-over is an “elongated impulse with exaggerated subdivisions” (Frost and Prechter,
2000, p. 31). Usually an extension will occur in only one of the subwaves in an impulse pattern.
Thus, if waves 1 and 5 are approximately the same length, wave 3 likely will be extended. In fact,
the third wave extension is the most common extended wave pattern in the stock market. In com-
ptg
modities, however, the extended wave is usually the fifth wave. When extended, a wave often
appears to have nine subwaves rather than the usual five. This is because the extended wavelets
are large enough to appear the same size as the subwaves themselves.

Truncation
Occasionally, the fifth wave fails to exceed the end of the third wave. This phenomenon is shown
in Figure 20.3. Elliott referred to this as a “failure.” Nevertheless, a truncated fifth wave will still
have five subwaves.

Corrective Waves
Corrective waves are unquestionably the most difficult to interpret. They can appear in many dif-
ferent configurations and pattern combinations. Richard Swannell and Robert Prechter have both
contributed to our current understanding of corrective waves. Swannell has tested price data,
searching for waves, and Prechter has interpreted Elliott’s original work with some modifica-
tions. The following information about corrective waves comes from the work of these two ana-
lysts.
Corrective waves commonly occur in three subwaves (A-B-C). The direction of corrective
waves is either sideways, as in a trading range, or sharply opposite to the prevailing trend of the
impulse wave. Corrective waves are generalized into three categories for descriptive purposes:
zigzags, flats, and triangles.

Zigzags
The single A-B-C correction in Figure 20.4 is an example of a zigzag correction. Generally, in a
simple zigzag, wave A is an impulse, leading diagonal, or zigzag; wave B is any corrective pat-
tern; and wave C is an impulse, ending diagonal, or zigzag. If wave A is a diagonal, wave C is not
an ending diagonal.
In addition to this simple, single A-B-C correction, a zigzag correction can occur as a more
complex double or triple zigzag pattern. The second correction pictured in Figure 20.4 shows the
more complex double zigzag. Double and triple zigzags use different nomenclature for their
descriptions. The double zigzag, for example, is two simple zigzags joined by a wave X. As
shown in Figure 20.4, W and Y are often used to designate each simple zigzag wave within the
double zigzag. When another simple zigzag is added to a double zigzag, a triple zigzag forms.
The added simple zigzag is referred to as wave Z; the intervening wave is labeled XX. Fortu-
nately, for interpretive purposes, triple zigzags are rare.

Swannell (2003) provides the following characteristics for actual double zigzags:
• Wave W is a zigzag.
• Wave X is any corrective pattern other than an expanding triangle.
• Wave X is smaller than wave W.
• Wave Y is a zigzag.
• Wave Y is equal to or larger than wave X.
Triple zigzags continue with the same pattern as double zigzags; thus, wave XX is smaller
than both wave Y and Z. Prechter points out that zigzags characteristically have a 5-3-5 combi-
nation of subwaves.

Sideways patterns are called flats. Flats behave very similarly to zigzags except that rather than
sharp upward or downward corrections to the prevailing trend, they move sideways, and their
subwaves generally overlap. The characteristics for flats are the same as for zigzags except that
• Wave B is not a triangle, retraces wave A by at least 50%, and is less than twice the
length of wave A.
• Wave C overlaps wave A at some point.
The A-B-C pattern in Figure 20.5 shows a simple flat pattern. In addition to this single A-
B-C pattern, flats can occur as a double or a triple. Double and triple flats have the same nomen-
clature as double and triple zigzags. Just like triple zigzags, triple flats are rare. The
characteristics of the double and triple flats are similar to their zigzag counterparts except for the
necessary adjustments needed to produce a sideways pattern. Thus, common characteristics of
these multiple flat patterns are as follows:
• Waves W, X, and XX can be any corrective pattern except a triangle, a double, or a
triple. ptg
• Waves Y and Z can be any corrective pattern except a double or triple.
• Wave X retraces at least 50% of wave W.
• Wave Y is greater than wave X unless it is a triangle.
• Wave XX retraces at least 50% of wave Y.
• Wave Z is not a zigzag if wave Y is a zigzag.
• Wave Z is greater than wave XX.

Prechter points out that flats characteristically have a 3-3-5 combination of subwaves. Elliott, he
argues, considered the sideways patterns as possibly including a combination of zigzag and flat,
one followed by the other in a complex corrective wave. These were called doubles and triple
threes. The method of designating each pattern is the same as the method used previously for
double and triple sideways patterns.
Triangles
The Elliott wave triangle is identical to the standard triangle pattern we discussed in Chapter 15,
“Bar Chart Patterns,” with the exception that it is limited to five waves (A-B-C-D-E). Prechter
points out that triangles have a 3-3-3-3-3 combination of minor waves. The Elliott wave triangle
can be either a converging or a diverging triangle.
The rules for a converging triangle are as follows:
• Wave A is a zigzag or a flat.
• Wave B is only a zigzag.
• Waves C and D can be any corrective pattern except a triangle.
• Waves A, B, C, and D move within the bounds of the channel lines between A to C
ptg
and B to D.
• Bounds converge (one might be horizontal), and the intersection of the bounds occurs
beyond the end of wave E.
• Wave E can be a zigzag or a converging triangle.
• Either wave A or B is the longest wave.
• Wave E ends in the range of wave A.
• Wave E moves within or closes within the bounds.
Expanding triangles, although relatively rare, have generally the same rules. The exceptions are
that for the expanding triangle
• Wave B is smaller than wave C but more than 40% of wave C.
• Wave C is smaller than wave D but more than 40% of wave D.
• The intersection of the bounds occurs before the formation of the triangle.
• Wave E is longer than wave D.
• Wave E ends outside the territory of wave A.
• Either wave A or B is the shortest wave.
Guidelines and General Characteristics in EWT
In addition to rules, guidelines exist within EWT. While the rules are inviolate, EWT guidelines
are less definite and will not occur at all times.

Alternation
Alternation is an EWT guideline. Alternation refers to the common occurrence of one type of
corrective wave occurring in wave 2 and a different type of correction occurring in wave 4. In
other words, the types of corrective waves tend to alternate. If wave 2 is a flat, for example, wave
4 will likely be some other type of corrective wave, such as a zigzag or a triangle. The guideline
of alternation can also occur in a corrective wave when, for example, the first part of a double is
a zigzag and the second part is a flat, as shown in Figure 20.6.

Equality
At least two of the three impulse subwaves in a five-wave sequence are often equal in length.
Usually equality exists between wave 1 and wave 5, especially when wave 3 is extended. How-
ever, if wave 1 or wave 5 is extended, the remaining two will tend toward equality.
Channeling
Channels, similar to those we discussed in Chapter 14, “Moving Averages,” are used in conjunc-
tion with EWT. To construct a channel for a five-wave impulse, draw a line between the end of
wave 1 and wave 3; then draw a parallel line through the end of wave 2. Price will tend to oscil-
late within this channel.

Sometimes, wave 4 falls short of the lower channel line, as shown in Figure 20.7. When
this occurs, draw a new line from the end of wave 2 to the end of wave 4. This line will be steeper
than the original lower channel line. Then draw another parallel line running through the end of
wave 3. This will give a rough approximation of where wave 5 should end. A throw-over occurs
when wave 5 exceeds this second channel line and usually denotes excessive emotion in the mar-
ket and possibly an extended fifth wave.

Projected Targets and Retracements
How can EWT be used to project prices? In the next section, we discuss Fibonacci ratios and
their use in projection. Because of the importance of Fibonacci numbers, we devote an entire
section to their use. Right now, we mention a few other methods.
Some analysts use the channeling method for projections. These channels are useful
because all price movement should lie within the channel. Prechter, however, mentions that two
guidelines for target projections are available in addition to the channeling method. The first
occurs in wave 4. The extent of the larger wave 4 correction should be no further than the end of
wave 4 of lesser degree. In other words, the larger wave 4 should not break through the end of the
minor wave 4 in the larger wave 3 preceding the larger wave 4. The fourth wave target is shown
in Figure 20.8.

Chapter 20 Elliott, Fibonacci, and Gann 489
Figure 20.9 illustrates a projection that occurs at the end of wave 5 extensions. When wave
5 extends, the corrective wave that follows is steep and often ends either at the minor wave 2 of
the extended wave 5 or at the end of wave 4. In other words, the corrective wave following an
extended wave 5 often corrects all or most of the extended wave 5 move.
From his screening of actual patterns, Swannell (2003) reports that the most accurate pat-
terns for predicted results are the triangle and ending diagonal. Their consistent behavior after
their completion gives results accurate enough to be almost 90% dependable.
Other means of estimating target prices have been proposed. Hill, Pruitt, and Hill (2000),
for example, estimate that in impulses, the target for wave 3 is 50% of wave 1 added to wave 1,
and the target for wave 5 is 100% of wave 1 added to wave 1. Their estimates of retracements are
based on the length of wave A, the first correction wave. If wave A corrects 25% to 35% of the
prior impulse wave, it will likely be only a single wave correction. If wave A corrects 35% to
50%, the correction will likely be a three-wave correction, and if wave A corrects 50% to 75%, it
will likely be a five-wave correction. Any reaction more than 75% suggests a possible trend
change.
The most common methods of determining targets and replacements use multiples of the
Fibonacci ratios. We now turn our attention to the derivation of these numbers.

Alternatives to EWT
As would be expected with a theory that is so difficult to apply, many analysts have differing
opinions about Elliott rules and guidelines. Most of these analysts stick with the general princi-
ples of impulse waves and corrective waves and their five-wave and three-wave subdivisions, but
the application of other observations in the specific waves and interpretations of Elliott can
sometimes cause quite differing results.
In his book, Mastering Elliott Wave, Glenn Neely (1990) takes the reader from the most
simple wave construction through an extremely lengthy set of rules that encompass his theory of
how waves unfold. In doing so, the reader learns by practice how to set up an Elliott wave chart
using the Neely method of dots rather than bar charts, how to determine monowaves and their
larger patterns, and other nomenclature and idiosyncrasies of Elliott analysis.
Zoran Gayer, a student of the Neely school of Elliott analysis, has developed a sophisti-
cated approach called bifurcation. This method is an offshoot of chaos theory, where motion
goes from erratic to organized, just as prices go from consolidation to trending. In Elliott terms,
this would equate to going from corrective waves to impulse waves. Zoran, as he is known, calls
them directional and nondirectional moves. Directional moves are those that do not correct more
than 61.8%. The bifurcation points are not necessarily the extreme high or low of a wave but can
occur when the price action changes tone and direction, such as at the end of wave 3 in conven-
tional Elliott labeling. The method becomes complicated and requires close study. Past Zoran
commentaries can be seen at www.safehaven.com/archive-11.htm.

As with all the preceding methods, the assumptions underlying the market structure are
that prices are determined by patterns of human nature and sentiment. Elliott believed that senti-
ment rose and fell in fits and starts that could be identified and labeled with his wave structure.
That these fits and starts followed a mathematical sequence such as the Fibonacci sequence came
as no surprise to Elliott.
However, Elliott’s hypothetical structure has been analyzed by others who have used dif-
ferent growth structure models, even assuming that the controlling mathematics are still the
Fibonacci ratios. Tony Plummer (2003), for example, hypothesizes that the growth curve of
nature as well as sentiment in markets is a three-wave process influenced by shock. Shock need
not be exogenous. It can be just the sudden realization that the markets have changed direction.
Thus, the three-wave sequence consists of the first wave changed by natural causes and its natu-
ral completion in a normal growth curve, then a flat period as the new circumstances are evalu-
ated, and finally the realization that the trend has changed and a second directional move. The
entire cycle is composed of a zigzag up of three legs and a zigzag down, three separate cycles
within the longer cycle, as illustrated in Figure 20.10. Using this method, Plummer maintains
that he has been able to integrate Fibonacci, cycle analysis, and EWT into a simpler and more
easily understood method of recognizing structure in the markets.

always seems to have exceptions, the description of waves often can only be determined after the
fact, and the means of projecting into the future are suspect. This is not to say that the theories do
not have value. They do, and at certain instances they can be profitably utilized. To do this, the
analyst must be fully trained in Elliott analysis and be patient enough to wait for an opportunity
that is clearly within the realm of the implied Elliott structure. Because Elliott analysis is not eas-
ily computerized, its practical interpretation needs other technical tools before any profitable sig-
nals can be derived.
Steven Poser (2003) is correct in stating that too many Elliott analysts attempt to pick the
top and bottom of moves rather than take a piece out of the middle. They overanalyze the waves
and generally become overwhelmed by minutia. He suggests that at least two other technical
methods must confirm any Elliott wave expectation. Other suggestions are to determine the
period in which the analyst is most interested and analyze the next higher and lower degree
waves to establish the context within which trading or investing will occur. Establish key price
levels, he says, such as targets, retracement levels, and important reversal points based on the
Elliott analysis, and use other indicators such as moving averages and oscillators to confirm
action signals. For example, he looks for momentum confirmation in wave 3 and divergences in
wave 5. More important, he argues, the analyst must be aware of the behavior of the market espe-
cially at certain juncture points. The Elliott Wave Theory is a model of behavior, a useful means
of understanding the position of the market within itself, not a mechanical system of forecasting. ptg
Connie Brown (1994, 1999), who worked for Prechter for a few years and is now a profes-
sional trader and adviser, has devised oscillators to confirm waves within an Elliott context. She
simplifies Elliott’s basic rules into a five-wave pattern, where waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses:
• Wave 2 might not break below the origin of wave 1.
• Wave 3 cannot be the shortest wave, but it does not necessarily have to be the longest.
• Wave 4 cannot overlap the termination of wave 1.
Rather than becoming obsessed with the smaller threes and fives and other patterns, Brown
claims that getting a feel for the rhythm in the market is more important. By compressing the
scale in a chart, the smaller, less-important details become obscure, and attention then focuses on
the market rhythm. Professional expertise is not needed to make money from this pattern. To
determine the Elliott five-wave pattern, Brown begins at the middle of a pattern where the largest
price move occurred and looks forward and backward (uncovering price action by widening the
distance between her thumbnails that are covering price action before and after the large price
move). She then uses Fibonacci ratios, Gann time, and price projections combined with oscilla-
tors based on the RSI and her composite index to estimate price projections and give action sig-
nals.
THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
Certain numbers and number sequences are of special interest in wave theory. Of particular
importance are the Fibonacci sequence and the related golden ratio.

Chapter 20 Elliott, Fibonacci, and Gann 493
Fibonacci
Leonardo Pisano, better known by his nickname Fibonacci, was born in 1170 in Pisa, Italy.
Fibonacci’s father, Guilielmo Bonacci, was a public notary, working for the interests of the mer-
chants of the Republic of Pisa. Because of Guilielmo’s work, Fibonacci traveled with his family
extensively through Northern Africa and the Mediterranean as a child. At a young age, Fibonacci
was exposed to the mathematical and accounting systems of the various merchants with which
his father worked. In his writings, Fibonacci recalls learning the mathematical and accounting
systems of India, Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence.
Around the age of 30, Fibonacci ended his travels and returned to Pisa. There he wrote a
number of important texts that played an important role in reviving ancient mathematical skills.
Copies of his books Liber abaci (1202), Practica geometriae (1220), Flos (1225), and Liber
quadratorum (1225) still exist today. Other books written by Fibonacci, such as his book on
commercial arithmetic, Di minor guisa, have been lost.
The writings of Fibonacci are credited with bringing the Hindu-Arabic decimal place
mathematical symbols that we use today to Western Europe. Many of his works dealt with pric-
ing issues faced by merchants. He is thought to have invented present value analysis of cash
flows in contracts and a method for expressing investment returns. In addition, he solved a num-
ber of complex interest rate problems (Goetzmann, 2003). Fibonacci was likely the world’s ptg
greatest mathematician in his time. Although his work formed the basis of our decimal system,
and he laid the groundwork for financial mathematics, he is unfortunately remembered today
almost exclusively for a small portion of his life’s work—his numerical sequence.
The Fibonacci Sequence
Fibonacci derived the sequence by answering the question of how many rabbits can be produced
over a year from an original pair, in an enclosed space, when all pairs give birth each month to a
new pair that in turn can breed in two months. The sequence of pairs occurs in the following
manner by month: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, and 144. These are called Fibonacci num-
bers. Fibonacci numbers are simply a sequence in which the last number is added to the previous
number to arrive at the next number. For example, 5 plus 3, the previous number, produces 8, the
next number; next, 8 plus 5 produces 13, the next number. This sequence can continue to infinity.
The Golden Ratio
There are a number of reasons why this sequence is of interest to mathematicians and scientists.
One reason is the relationship that the sequence has to the “golden ratio.” Except in the very low
numbers, the ratio of any number in the sequence to the next lower number is 1.618 (e.g., 144/89
= 1.61798); the ratio of any number in the sequence to the next highest number approaches 0.618
(e.g., 55/89 = 0.61798). The number 1.618, known as the golden ratio, and its reciprocal of
0.618, possess many interesting properties. For example, it is the only number that when added
to 1 is the same as 1 divided by itself. Another fascinating fact is that 1.618 multiplied times
0.618 = 1. There are many more strange relationships between .618 and whole numbers; see Box

20.1 for a demonstration of the “mystery” of this number. Mathematicians use the Greek letter
phi to refer to this ratio.
The golden ratio has been of interest at least since the pyramids were built and likely long
before. Buildings built in proportion to the golden ratio were thought to be most pleasing to the
eye. The Parthenon and the Washington Monument, for example, have dimensions based on the
golden ratio. Not until relatively recently, in terms of the history of civilization, was the golden
ratio derived mathematically through the Fibonacci sequence.
BOX 20.1 GOLDEN RATIO (1.618) FROM ARBITRARY WHOLE NUMBERS
Pick any two whole numbers. For this example, we picked 14 and 285, but it will
work for any two numbers. Add the two numbers together. In the following example,
14 + 285 equals 299. Calculate the ratio of the sum and the second addend; in our
example, this is 299/285 = 1.049. Repeat the process adding the second addend (e.g.,
285) to the resulting sum (e.g., 299). As you progress through the iterations, notice
how the ratio approaches 1.618.

2. Add the result to the highest previous: 285 + 299 584 1.953

4. Add the result to the highest previous: 584 + 883 1467 1.661
5. Add the result to the highest previous: 883 + 1467 2350 1.602
6. Add the result to the highest previous: 1467 + 2350 3817 1.624
7. Add the result to the highest previous: 2350 + 3817 6167 1.616
8. Add the result to the highest previous: 3817 + 6167 9984 1.619
9. Add the result to the highest previous: 6167 + 9984 16151 1.618
Plato considered the golden ratio to be the “most binding of all mathematical relations, and
considered it the key to the physics of the cosmos” (Frost and Prechter, 2000, p. 101). German-
born, seventeenth-century mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer, Johannes Kepler likened
the golden ratio to a fine jewel and claimed that it described all creation. The reason for this ado-
ration is that the ratio appears in innumerable natural phenomena. For example, consider a spiral
that has its arc length to its diameter at a ratio of 1.618; this spiral occurs in nature in comet tails,
galaxy spirals, spider webs, pine cones, snail shells, ocean waves, and even the human finger
when curled. It is universal. It is a growth pattern in nature, and Elliott hypothesized that it
occurred in the stock market as well.

Chapter 20 Elliott, Fibonacci, and Gann 495
Look back at Figure 20.1; see how the number of waves, as the pattern becomes more com-
plex, follows a Fibonacci sequence. The first waves are corrective and impulse, one and one,
totaling to two. Then there are three corrective waves and five impulse waves, totaling eight
waves. Each of these numbers is part of the Fibonacci sequence. If we take the progression fur-
ther and include smaller and smaller waves, the number of waves continues in a Fibonacci
sequence. Although this relation to Fibonacci numbers is interesting, it is portraying the ideal.
But remember if you take any two whole numbers and add them together, then add to the sum the
previous highest number, eventually you will arrive at phi, the Fibonacci ratio (1.618), between
the highest number and the previous highest number. (See the example in Box 20.1.) Thus, the
ratio is the universal relation rather than the numbers themselves. It is the ratio and derivatives of
it that are applied to stock markets.
Price and Time Targets
Elliott wave enthusiasts, to predict retracements and price targets, as we have already seen, and
to project the timing of the next series of waves, use Fibonacci ratios. For example, Prechter
notes that corrective waves tend to correct approximately 61.8%, or its complement 38.2%
(100%–61.8%), of their corresponding impulse waves. Prechter is quick to point out, however,
that this is a tendency, not even a guideline, and is not dependable. He found that more reliable ptg
relations exist in projecting target prices for alternating waves. For example, in percentage terms,
impulse waves tend to be related in some manner by 2.618, 1.618, 0.618, or 0.382. As an exam-
ple, he noted that the rise in the Dow Jones Industrial from the low in 1932 to 1937, wave 1,
gained 371.6%, while wave 3 from 1942 to 1966 gained 971.7%, 2.618 times as much. This rela-
tionship is pictured in Figure 20.11.
Numerous other examples of relations between waves can be cited. One common occur-
rence is when wave 1 and wave 5 are the same length, wave 3 is often either 1.618 or 2.681 times
wave 1. In addition, in a fifth wave extension, the length of the fifth wave is frequently 1.618
times the length from the beginning to the end of wave 3. Many times in an extended wave 1, the
remaining four waves end at 0.618 the length of the extended first wave. In corrective waves,
wave C is often related to wave A in some Fibonacci ratio, and the wave 4 length is often related
by a Fibonacci ratio or by equality to the length of wave 2.
In addition to the extent of price movements in waves being related by Fibonacci numbers,
times in stock market data have also been related to the Fibonacci ratio. However, this exercise is
spurious at best. Tables are often used to show the time differences between important peaks and
valleys in market prices that occurred in a Fibonacci number of years, months, or days. Elliott
himself used the example of the 34 months between the peak in September 1929 and the bottom

in July 1932 and the 13 years between the peak in 1929 and the low in 1942 (see Figure 20.12).
Although others also have seen a relation between Fibonacci time counts and important events,
Hamilton Bolton, a contemporary of and correspondent with Elliott, and publisher of the Bank
Credit Analyst, stated, “Permutations tend to become infinite” (Frost and Prechter, 2000, p. 141).
One of the tenets of any technical theory is that the principles must make sense. In the case of
time, which is determined somewhat arbitrarily by humans and differently over the ages, the
likelihood of there being a consistent series of time intervals that follow Fibonacci sequence
numbers is a little far fetched. Indeed, a comprehensive study by Herbert Riedel, PhD (1989) on
182 days of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1985 demonstrated that no evidence of
Fibonacci ratios was present either in retracements or in timing.

Although there is perhaps a far-too-often coincidence of waves being related to other
waves by some variations of the Fibonacci ratio, the practical problem is that the relations, even
if valid, are not usually known until after the fact. Thus, the relations are interesting but generally
unproductive. To some extent, the same can be said about wave structure. One of the great prob-
lems with Elliott wave analysis is that the proper sequence of impulse and corrective waves is not
often recognized until after the price action has completed. Even then, analysts—even those with
considerable experience—will argue over whether the configuration is one type or another. For
the technical analyst, especially one starting out, the concept of the Elliott Wave Theory must be
understood in general terms, but the likelihood of being a seasoned practitioner is remote with-
out considerable study, analysis, memorization of the rules and guidelines, and inspection of
many long- and short-term price charts.

498 Part VI Other Technical Methods and Rules
made several fortunes in the commodities markets, married a number of younger women, and
spent huge sums on planes, yachts, real estate, and gambling in Cuba (Costa, 2000). Some
believe he was a scoundrel, that his courses on trading were full of generalities and astrology, and
that he sold his advisory service several times (Williams, www.ireallytrade.com/asiseeit.htm).
We do know that he died with very few assets. Nevertheless, Gann was a prolific writer, both of
novels and advisory books. He published articles and sold courses on trading. Richard Wyckoff
wrote an article on his trading, and Gann received considerable notoriety in his time for trading,
especially in cotton. He was a superb trader, as witnessed by several independent observers.
Whether or not he used the methods he proposed is uncertain.
Gann’s published concept of market structure, specifically in commodity markets, encom-
passed time as well as price. He is known for such things as circles, squares, and triangles, all
having to do with the angles of a circle. For example, he strongly believed in the seasonal cycle
of approximately 360 days, the same as the number of degrees in a circle, the circle of the earth
traveling around the sun. Thus, portions of a circle were important, such as 90, for 90 degrees, a
quarter year, and 180, a half year; he expected that lows to highs or highs to lows would gener-
ally occur within those time periods or divisions of them. He preached that the range between
tops and bottoms could be divided into zones that would project retracement levels, and he used
angles drawn from tops and bottoms that when crossed, especially at the same level as his sup-
port and resistance zones, were important predictors of time and price for retracements. His con- ptg
cept of squares and rectangular shapes, not mathematical formulas, defined where in time and
price future price motion should occur. Gann also discovered the strength of the fifth year of each
decade, which since 1905 has been an up year. He claimed incorrectly to have invented swing
charts, but he did successfully promote them as a method of trend following. His square of 52 is
based on the 52 weeks in a year, or in a circle. His square of 144 is 12312, or the number of
months in a circle. He devised spiral calculators such as the square of nine, the square of four, the
360-degree circle chart, and the hexagon chart. Gann also published a summary of 28 trading
rules, all of which are still valid today.
There is no question that Gann was an inventive person. Whether his discoveries are hocus-
pocus to sell his courses and books we do not know, because his methods are too vague to prop-
erly test, but even today a few analysts follow his numerological methods and claim success.
CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we have discussed the resemblance of stock market cycles to cycles seen occur-
ring in nature. The basis for much of this theory goes back to the work of Ralph Elliott in the late
1930s. Elliott’s work focuses on the waves in the stock market, especially how these waves are
related to Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio. His work has been thoroughly studied by sub-
sequent analysts, especially by Robert Prechter.
The mathematical relationships and tie to nature found by these analysts can be fascinat-
ing. A basic knowledge of wave theory is a great aid to the technical analyst. However, making
profitable trading decisions based primarily on wave theory is difficult. The theory is complex,
requiring a great deal of study. Often waves can be found, in retrospect, which amazingly adhere

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with
• The major factors to consider when choosing a security to trade ptg
• The major factors to consider when choosing an investment security
• The relationship between hard asset and soft asset markets
• The basics of intermarket analysis
• The concept of relative strength among different investment vehicles and its implica-
tions for investors
• The basic methods of determining an individual stock’s relative strength
We have now reached the stage in technical analysis where we become more practical. After
learning how to analyze the long-term stock market and how to use various technical tools to
determine the best entry and exit points in individual issues, we now focus on exactly what issues
to consider for trading or investment goals. Those interested in using technical methods in mar-
kets must determine whether they have the time, inclination, and facilities to trade issues, or
whether they want to consume less time and utilize technical methods for investing over longer
periods.
WHICH ISSUES SHOULD I SELECT FOR TRADING?
Trading requires a complete commitment to the markets. It requires time every day and night,
even if swing trading from day to day. Intraday trading requires constant attention, excellent exe-
cution abilities, and high-speed price reporting. It is not for everyone, and it is not advisable for
people who have other jobs and limited time to commit. Trading can be accomplished through

mechanical systems that are developed for that purpose, but even then, a heavy time commitment
is necessary to perform the executions, to monitor the system, and perhaps to develop new sys-
tems.
The wise trader will select more than one issue to trade. In the stock market and the futures
market, diversification is a necessity for many reasons. First, when a single issue becomes dor-
mant in a small trading range and is difficult to trade, other issues with which the trader is
already familiar can take its place. Second, following more than one issue increases the odds that
a profitable trend will not be missed. Third, diversification, especially in issues that are not cor-
related, reduces risk. Thus, when screening markets with the criteria discussed next, anywhere
from three to ten issues should be selected, watched, and traded. In Chapter 23, “Money and Risk
Management,” we will see that only a minimum commitment should be made to any one issue.
Trading only one issue, and using more than the suggested initial capital in that one issue, sub-
stantially increases risk of failure.
Some traders, rather than concentrating on just a few issues, would prefer to screen
through the entire marketplace for issues showing signs of an impending trend change. They pro-
gram their computers to search for new highs and lows, gaps, one- and two-day reversal patterns,
range and volatility changes, volume changes, moving average crossovers, and any number of
other short-term indicators of possible trend change in individual stocks and contracts. From this
information, they glean issues to trade over short periods and then go on to the next selected ptg
issues.
Choosing Between Futures Markets and Stock Markets
A trader must also make a choice about whether to trade in the stock market or the futures mar-
ket or both. This choice is a personal one. The trader must consider a number of factors when
making this decision. These factors include costs, personal risk preferences, preferred time hori-
zon for trading, familiarity with each market, access to the proper equipment, and execution
capability. Let us look at these factors in a little more detail.
Costs
Trading is a grueling, time-consuming process. It is not as glamorous as some recent movies
make it out to be. Aside from the emotional strain of having to make instant decisions and instant
executions, trading has many hidden costs that add up because of the many transactions neces-
sary to profit. These transaction costs go beyond the commissions paid to the executing broker.
The first cost is the initial setup of equipment. To trade, you must have not only a high-speed
computer, excellent data feeds, and reliable, quick execution capability, but you must also have a
backup. You cannot afford to have your system go down during a short-term, especially intraday,
trade. Other costs are commissions, slippage, missing the intended price during a fast market,
limit days, and unexpected events, seemingly always occurring at a critical juncture. (The dog
pulls the wires out of the computer, the cat walks across the keyboard and executes several
orders, and so on.)

Chapter 21 Selection of Markets and Issues: Trading and Investing 505
Risk
Each trader must determine his or her own level of risk tolerance. Futures are considerably more
risky than stocks because they are usually traded with high leverage. Leverage is the amount of
capital that can be borrowed to initiate and carry a position. Because futures can be entered into
with a relatively small amount of personal capital, a trade can lose all its capital with a small
adverse move. With futures, the danger always exists that an adverse move will eliminate the
trader’s protective margin, requiring the trader to come up with more funds or be “stopped out.”
We investigate this leverage risk more thoroughly in Chapter 23. Stocks can also be lever-
aged, but usually not to the degree that futures can, and are, thus, not as risky to capital. This is
not to say, however, that a stock trader cannot go broke as quickly as a futures trader can. Capital
risk depends on many other factors than just leverage.
Suitability
Your experience in the markets determines the issues with which you are most comfortable. For
beginners in technical trading, the slowest and least risky markets are the best. Once your trading
experience provides enough confidence, you can enter other faster and more risky issues. Suit-
ability also encompasses time available, how much should be invested in fancy quote and execu-
tion equipment, and so on. It is based on personal choice and preference. ptg
Time Horizon
Three types of trading are done by nonmarket makers—scalping, day trading, and swing trading.
Scalping is taking very small profits between the bid and ask prices of a stock. It requires very
close attention, excellent execution, fast-feed charting equipment, and communications, in addi-
tion to considerable experience. The competition is fierce between the scalper and the market
makers, specialists, floor traders, and those others very closely connected with the issues being
traded. This type of trading is not for amateurs.
Day trading is trading an issue and closing all positions by the end of the day. It has an
advantage in that there is no overnight risk because no position is held overnight. A variation of
day trading is called screen trading. Screen trading uses technical analysis intraday shown on a
computer screen to give signals. The bar lengths are determined by the trader’s ability to react
quickly and accurately. Most commercial intraday technical analysis software divides trading
into anywhere from single tick-by-tick, to 5-, 10-, 15-, and 60-minute bar lengths. From this data
and software, almost any indicator or pattern can be programmed and used to identify opportuni-
ties. Again, however, it requires the time to watch positions all day and the equipment necessary
to execute and watch entries and exits. Nevertheless, day trading has become very popular. The
new automated electronic exchanges where trades are executed immediately against the trading
book have revolutionized day trading and made markets more accessible to nonprofessionals.
The advent of the e-mini S&P 500 futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is an excellent
example of a futures contract that is executed almost instantly and has a margin requirement con-
siderably less than its earlier, larger version.
Swing trading, the third type of trading, is more easily accomplished by amateurs. It is the
holding of positions over several days or weeks, attempting to catch the small trends accompany-
ing or counter to a longer trend. The swing trader can determine entry and exit prices during non-

trading hours and can judiciously place orders for the next trading day to enter or exit positions.
Many swing traders watch the market throughout the day, but it is often not necessary.
Of course, professional traders are active in all the preceding trading methods because they
are intimately in tune with the markets.
Volatility
As we saw in some of the short-term trading patterns, low volatility is a difficult world in which
to make profits. The breakout from low volatility to high volatility is where most of the profit is
derived. Therefore, futures or stocks with low volatility are generally not good choices for trad-
ing. The transaction costs of exit and entry, the possible mistakes in execution, and other costs
demand that the issue traded has enough price change to make a profit despite these problems.
Liquidity
Volatility, however, must be accompanied by liquidity. Price changes may be large (high volatil-
ity), but if no size is available for trading, this volatility is of no use to the trader. Liquidity is the
ability to transact a meaningful number of shares or contracts easily and without bringing about
a large price change. Even volatility with heavy volume may be deceiving if the volume only
occurs sporadically within the trading horizon or is the product of high-speed trading systems ptg
buying and selling the spread for large investment firms. For stocks, volatility can be measured
using the ATR14. A more complicated formula is necessary for futures because of the different
dollar value of point moves and the different margin requirements for each market contract.
Volatility usually is related to the size of the bid and ask and the spread between bid and
ask. A narrow spread does not guarantee liquidity because the bid and ask may be small. For easy
entry and exit, high liquidity is a requirement. Trading is difficult enough without having to
worry about whether an order will be executed close to the desired price. Each month, a section
of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities called “Futures Liquidity” shows a list of the
most popular futures markets with their respective relative liquidity. These figures are based on
the number of contract expirations that are traded, the total open interest, and volume. The list
also displays the margin and effective margin for each contract series.
Volume
Issues with constant heavy volume are usually issues that have liquidity, but they might not have
sufficient volatility to profit. Volume is, therefore, a requirement for a trading issue, but it is not
the final determinant. Liquidity and volatility are also required.
WHICH ISSUES SHOULD I SELECT FOR INVESTING?
When investing, the universe of potential investments is enormous. This means that some
method must be used to cull out the investments, determining those most likely to outperform the
markets. Usually, the investor only goes long investments or in cash, rarely short, though in the
commodities markets, long one currency, for example, may be equivalent to being short the
other. Let us look at some of the items you need to consider when choosing investment securities.

Chapter 21 Selection of Markets and Issues: Trading and Investing 507
In the futures markets, selection is usually based on a ratio analysis of each future versus a
basket of futures or against another investment vehicle. In the stock market, selection uses two
different methods. The first method is the top-down method whereby the prospects for the mar-
ket are first determined, then the prospects for groups (such as industry groups or countries) are
determined, and finally—after the decision is made that the market is favorable and certain
groups are favorable for investment—specific stocks are selected from within the groups. This
method is more common in fundamental analysis and in professional management where there
may be little choice as to whether to be in the stock market or not. It is often called asset alloca-
tion, and the first step is the group selection.
The second method is the bottom-up method, whereby stocks are selected, usually based
on their price behavior. This method is more technically oriented because it uses relative price
strength as one of its primary selection criteria. By selecting stocks first, regardless of their group
affiliations, the portfolio manager can assess what groups are performing well and whether the
entire market is favorable or not. If few stocks come through the screens for performance, it is
clear that the market is in difficulty, for example, and if many stocks meet the investment criteria,
the market is favorable.
TOP-DOWN ANALYSIS ptg
Top-down analysis begins with a study of the major markets such as interest rates, currencies,
and stock market to determine which market has the highest possibility of profit in the future.
Once a market has been selected, the next level of decision making is the groupings of issues in
that market and, finally, the individual issues within those groupings. In the currency markets,
the breakdown for U.S. investors is basically whether to invest in the dollar or in a foreign cur-
rency. If it is to be a foreign currency, the selection is large and can be broken into further
groups—for example, the resource-producing countries and the emerging countries. If the bond
market is chosen, the groupings can be on length to maturity, country and currency, and level of
default risk. In the stock market, of course, industry groups are the standard sectors, but others
are used such as capitalization, foreign origin, investment style, and interest-rate related. The
investor must decide the long-term, secular trend in the various markets. As in trading, the trend
is the most important aspect of any price change and the major determinant of whether the
investor will profit from investing. Bucking the trend in investing is just as dangerous as it is in
trading.
The technical method used to determine markets’ relative attractiveness is called ratio
analysis. It compares different markets with each other to see which is performing most favor-
ably. After a market has been selected that fits the investor’s objectives, further comparisons are
made with components of that market, such as by industry group, capitalization, or quality.
Secular Emphasis
John Murphy, in his book Intermarket Technical Analysis (1991), discussed the concept of alter-
nating emphasis in the markets on hard assets and soft assets over long secular periods. “Secular”
is a term used for any period longer than the business cycle. Hard assets are solid commodities

508 Part VII Selection
such as gold and silver; these assets traditionally are considered an inflation hedge. Soft assets
are financial assets, called paper assets, that primarily include stocks and bonds.
Generally, when hard assets rise in value, soft assets decline. However, since 1998, this
relationship has not always held. The reason for the inverse relationship between the value of
hard assets and of soft assets is that a close correlation exists between material prices and inter-
est rates. Inflation, or higher material prices, is generally associated with higher interest rates.
When inflation becomes a threat, paper assets, which decrease in value as interest rates rise, are
undesirable as investments. Likewise, when hard asset prices decline, interest rates usually
decline, and soft assets increase in value.
The theory that one or the other of these kinds of assets becomes popular for substantial
periods is not a new one. The principal problem with proving this theory is the lack of hard asset
prices going back before the free market in gold in the late 1960s. Nevertheless, the concept
likely has some validity because since then, markets have generally alternated between these two
basic types. One thought is that a 16-year hard/soft asset cycle exists. If so, it appears that the
markets have returned from a soft asset market to a hard asset market, as of 2002.
Gold is traditionally the measure of hard asset prices because of its universal appeal as an
inflation hedge. Figure 21.1 shows the history of gold prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-
age since 1973. Mostly, these two markets head in opposite directions. Gold is the hard asset;
U.S. stocks are the soft assets. Notice that when gold prices rise, the stock market declines, and ptg
vice versa. This behavior led to the theory of alternating hard and soft asset markets.

indicates that gold is underperforming the stock market and, in relationship to the stock market,
is not a wise investment.

The broad signal as to when to switch from one asset class to another is given when the
ratio crosses its 48-month EMA. As seen in Figure 21.2, the last signal to switch from hard assets
to soft assets occurred in June 1981, just three months after the peak in the gold price at a time
when the DJIA was at 998.

FIGURE 21.2 Ratio line of gold to the DJIA versus the DJIA line
The next switch signal came in September 2001 when the ratio crossed above its 48-month
EMA, signaling a move into hard assets. Between the 1981 signal to soft assets and the 2001 sig-
nal to hard assets, gold had declined to $320 and the DJIA had advanced to 10,000. In the rela-
tively short period since the hard asset buy signal, gold has risen to $1,200 and the DJIA has
remained relatively flat with high volatility. Although these signals are not precise by any means,
they do indicate over long periods in what asset type the investor should be invested. Once a def-
inite trend toward one or the other asset type is clear, it usually remains in place for many years.
Although we have used gold as an example of a hard asset thus far, gold is not necessarily
the best hard asset. Others exist such as silver, oil, copper, and aluminum. These are called
“industrial raw materials” and are normally associated with the business cycle. Along with gold,
these industrial prices have a long-term component that follows the gold price and gives more
options for investment during a period of hard assets types.
Figure 21.3 shows the relationship between industrial raw material prices and the stock
market since 1973. As you can see, the moving average crossovers in the ratio occur at approxi-
mately the same time as those for the gold market alone did in Figure 21.2. Thus, when we see
the ratio of gold or industrial raw material prices to the stock market cross its 48-month EMA,
we know that a long-term shift is occurring in the investment emphasis from hard assets to soft
assets or vice versa.

What does this mean for investment selection? Being in the time period following the 2001
signal for the switch to hard assets suggests that analysis should be concentrated on those invest-
ments concerned with hard asset prices. Those investments could be in futures or spot markets of
the hard assets themselves; however, this group also includes stocks of mining, oil- or forest
product-producing companies, or currencies in countries like Australia or Canada that are
involved in exporting raw materials. There are many choices, but the emphasis should be placed
on those investments that will gain from increases in industrial materials and gold prices. When
the tide turns the other way, and soft assets appear more promising, emphasis should be placed
on commodity users, not producers, consumer staples, anything related to interest rates, bonds
and stocks, or currencies of consuming nations.
Cyclical Emphasis
Within the longer secular economic trend are a number of business cycles. These business cycles
are of varying length but usually average around four to five years. These business cycles are the
normal horizon for most economists, business managers, and investors. It is well recognized that
leadership in the trading markets often switches within the business cycle. There appears to be a
standard pattern that is worth watching. Murphy maintains that although the markets may appear
independent, they are interrelated and follow certain patterns. For that reason, he suggests that
investors should be aware of all these markets and their interactions. The activity in all of these
markets might offer suggestions about investment prospects.
Martin Pring (2002) classifies investment markets into three categories: commodities,
bonds, and stocks. Murphy adds currencies and, to some extent, foreign stock markets, to this
list. The business cycle affects each of these markets but in different ways. Let us look at the nor-
mal sequence of leadership among these investments and see how to recognize when a change in

leadership has occurred. We will look in sequence at the dollar exchange rate to gold, using gold
as a proxy for inflation and commodity prices, gold to the long-term note (U.S. Treasury 10-year
note), a proxy for interest rates, the long-term note to the stock market (Dow Jones Industrial—
DJIA), and, finally, the stock market back to the dollar exchange rate (NYBOT U.S. Dollar
Index—DXY).
U.S. Dollar and Gold
Murphy maintains that currency rates influence industrial prices but sometimes with a consider-
able lead. The dollar is important in that it is the pricing currency for many of the world’s raw
materials such as oil, gold, and other precious metals. When the dollar declines, it makes these
commodities cheap in foreign currencies but expensive in dollar terms. Thus, there is a leading
inverse relationship between the U.S. dollar and raw materials prices in the United States. In Fig-
ure 21.4, we use gold as a proxy for industrial prices because gold has a well-defined price,
whereas most indexes of material prices have different weightings for their components and are,
thus, biased toward the interest of the respective index compilers. Figure 21.4 shows the ratio of
the dollar to gold and gold itself. When the ratio is rising, or the dollar is stronger than gold, gold
tends to decline, and vice versa.

In the business cycle, we use the 18-month SMA as the signal line. In Figure 21.4, this sig-
nal line crossed downward in September 2001, suggesting a rise in gold versus the dollar. The
signal line, as a proxy for commodity prices, suggested investment in industrial raw materials,
including gold, raw materials, energy, and any other inflation-affected securities. In October, the
signal line crossed upward, and gold declined for a few months, but then in May 2009, the signal
line broke down again, signaling the time to buy gold versus the dollar.

Gold and Bonds (Long-Term Interest Rates)
The next sequence is typically for industrial prices to lead long-term U.S. interest rates. By tak-
ing a ratio of the gold price to the U.S. Treasury ten-year note, we see that at certain times, a sig-
nal is given by the ratio as to when to enter or exit the long-term bond market. The ratio is shown
in Figure 21.5. In December 2001, the ratio crossed above its 18-month SMA, suggesting that
material prices were outperforming financials. That relationship held for almost seven years. A
flip-flop occurred in the debt crisis of 2008–2009 but as of May 2009, the ratio was back above
its moving average and suggesting that materials were still advantageous over bonds.

Bond Market and Stock Market
Ideally, the next switch in markets is from the bond market to the stock market. As Chapter 10,
“Flow of Funds,” demonstrated, the lead-lag relationship has not been a successful one since
1998. Murphy argues that this is because for the first time since the 1930s, actual deflation has
become a threat and has upset the previous balance between interest rates and the stock market.
Nevertheless, a plot of the ratio of bonds to stocks, as shown in Figure 21.6, shows very definite
times when one or the other has the advantage.
This chart shows that even if we had owned bonds, despite what the commodity markets
were suggesting, they should have been switched to the stock market around August 2003. From
that point to February 2008, when the ratio crossed below its moving average, the U.S. ten-year
note only rose from 112.3 to 188.6 (+5.6%) while the DJIA rose from 6416 to 11237 (+75%).
Then, following the crossover below the moving average in February, the relationship caught the
stock market decline (relative to bonds) into July 2009. As of mid-2010, the ratio is approaching
its moving average again from below. A positive crossover would be bearish for the stock market.

Stock Market and the U.S. Dollar
The final analysis is to return to the beginning and see how the dollar and the stock market have
interacted. Generally, the two markets are so out of sync that a ratio analysis will lag beyond the
investment period desired. The dollar usually leads the industrial raw material market, which in
turn generally leads the bond market, which in turn leads the stock market. By connecting the
loop, nothing is accomplished because there seems to be only a slight relationship between the
stock market and the dollar. This is born out in Figure 21.7, which compares the DJIA with the
U.S. dollar. The signal to buy the DJIA in preference to the dollar is late. The percentage returns
since are still favorable for the investor in the stock market but only partially favorable for the
earlier investment in the dollar. This is a good example of why the analyst must always be aware
of the absolute prices as well as the relative ones.
Implications of Intermarket Analysis
From the previous analysis, it appears that around 2001, the investor should have been looking at
the raw materials markets and the stock market. Because both markets appeared favorable, the
raw material market stocks would likely have been the best investments. The signals given by the
various ratios are usually long-term signals, in the sense that they are operating within the busi-
ness cycle. They are neither trading signals nor mechanical signals. Their purpose is to inform
the investor in which markets to invest solely from how the marketplaces are behaving. When
certain sectors become strong, they tend to remain strong, just as when a trend begins, it tends to
remain. Eventually these ratios will suggest changes in the investment mix, but only rarely do
they err, and often that miscalculation comes from the investor impatience and greed, treating the
signals as mechanical rather than waiting to be sure they are real.

One important caveat is that the signals come from ratios, not raw figures. Raw figures
should always be used as a backup. It is possible that sometime in the future all markets will
decline. In that case, the investor may find the “best” market but still lose money—perhaps not as
quickly as in other markets, but still lose. For this reason, the absolute value of markets must never
be overlooked. Many investors are happy with a relative return rather than an absolute return even
in a declining market. This is a major mistake because the law of percentages suggests that to
make back any actual loss is considerably more difficult than to make back a relative loss.
BOX 21.1 LAW OF PERCENTAGES
A relative loss of 20% can be made back with a relative gain of 20%, but an absolute
20% loss requires a 25% gain to break even. This is called the “law of percentages.”
In investing, it suggests that all absolute losses must be kept to a minimum. As the
old adage goes, “You can’t spend a relative return.” For example, if you have $100 in
capital and sustain a 20% loss, you are left with $80. You must earn a 25% return on
the $80 to return to the break-even level of $100. For any particular loss amount, the
percentage amount that must be gained to break even is calculated using the formula
% gain necessary = % loss ÷ (1–% loss). As an extreme example, a 50% loss requires
a 100% gain to break even. Considering the difficulty of investing for a 100% gain,
the investor is better off cutting losses before reaching such an extreme that is
unlikely to be recouped.

Finally, this analysis is not intended to forecast the economy. It is useful primarily in deter-
mining where the best market for investment might be at any time and for enough time for invest-
ment. Because most indicators lead the economy, forecasting the economy is unfruitful. From
this information, certain aspects of the economy are obvious, but investment is best left to the
analysis of price than to the analysis of the lagging economy.
Stock Market Industry Sectors
Some analysts have proposed theories of industry group and sector rotation during the stock mar-
ket cycle. These rule definitions, however, are too strict, and often the markets do not accommo-
date them. For example, some models suggest that utilities, generally considered interest-related
stocks, should be bought at certain stages of the market cycle when interest rates are expected to
decline. However, as we have seen previously, when an inflationary environment exists, anything
to do with interest rates will generally underperform. In other words, any system of following
specific models of business cycles is not flexible enough to account for changes in the major
market segments.
For some individuals, like stock mutual fund managers, investment in the stock market is a
requirement. In these instances, the best manner of screening out the most likely sectors to out-
perform is the use of ratio analysis between the sector performance and the stock market as a ptg
whole. For example, Figure 21.8 shows a three-point, point-and-figure plot of the (a) S&P Util-
ity Sector and the (b) S&P Financials Sector to the S&P 500, and Figure 21.9 shows a three-
point, point-and-figure plot of the S&P (a) Energy Sector and the (b) S&P Materials Sector to the

Plotting the relative strength ratio of an industry and often a stock to some underlying aver-
age, we often see an irregular line that is difficult to interpret. By plotting these ratios on a point-
and-figure chart, the minor, less significant oscillations are eliminated, and the overall
relationship of the two indices becomes more obvious. In Figure 21.8a, for example, it is clear
that underperformance of utility stocks began in 2009. These charts are much more informative
than a line chart. Remember, however, when deciding whether to act on any of the ratio analyses,
the absolute price action of the stock in the numerator always must be analyzed as well. When
both charts demonstrate a trend, one can act with more confidence.
BOTTOM UP—SPECIFIC STOCK SELECTION AND RELATIVE
STRENGTH
At present, almost 8,000 stocks trade in the active stock markets in the United States. This num-
ber is too large for an analyst to screen at frequent intervals. Some technical analysts briefly
inspect the chart of every stock in their universe, using either a bar, candlestick, or point-and-fig-
ure chart. This is a laborious process and far from objective. Others screen through relative
strength ratio charts. The least time-consuming and most objective method is to screen all stocks
on a periodic basis for relative price strength using one of the methods described next. Relative
strength provides evidence that a particular stock is outperforming the market and is very likely
in a strong, upward trend. These methods have also been used successfully in mutual funds,
ETFs, industry group selection, commodities, and foreign securities.

Relative Strength
Most technical screening methods use a concept called relative strength to judge which securities
have the most promise. Relative strength is a reliable concept that has been demonstrated aca-
demically and practically to have value. Indeed, because the method is so successful, it is the pri-
mary argument against the Random Walk and Efficient Markets Hypotheses. The presumption
behind the concept of relative strength is that strength will continue, similar to how trends will
continue, and that by recognizing the strongest trends, an edge can be obtained by investing in
them until their strength abates. If the strongest stocks remain strong, the market cannot be ran-
dom or efficient.
The most common means of establishing relative strength is called the ratio method. It is
merely the ratio between two investments, sectors, industry groups, averages, commodities, and
so on, to see which is outperforming the other. Usually a line chart is drawn that shows the item
of interest, say a steel stock, and a ratio of the item to an average, say a steel industry average. If
the line of the ratio is rising, it is simply showing that the particular stock is stronger than its
industry average. Interpretations of behavior are similar to those used in price and other oscilla-
tors. Divergence analysis, trend lines, and even patterns appear in the ratio lines. The item can
also be plotted in a point-and-figure chart along with a point-and-figure chart of the ratio similar
to what is shown in the sector charts shown in Figures 21.8 and 21.9. ptg
Academic Studies of Relative Strength
In 1967, Robert Levy, PhD, published a paper in the Journal of Finance in which he argued that
relative price strength tended to remain for a long-enough period that it could be profitable and
that the concept of random walk was, therefore, dead. His paper received considerable opposi-
tion at that time when the Efficient Markets Hypothesis and the Random Walk Hypothesis were
relatively new and highly favored among academics.
Not until 1993 was another major paper published on the subject of relative price strength,
or “momentum” as it is commonly called. This paper, “Returns to Buying Winners and Selling
Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency,” was also published in the Journal of Finance.
The authors, Professors Narishimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman, demonstrated how stocks
with high returns over a 3- to 12-month period earned excess profits of about 1% per month for
the following year. However, they also found that these stocks on average had losses 13 to 60
months later, thus proposing the theory that relative price strength was not permanent but more
likely a temporary phenomenon. They clearly stated that the t-test statistical evidence forced
them “to conclude that the hypothesis of market efficiency can be rejected at even the most con-
servative levels of significance.”
In a study of 150 momentum (relative strength) and contrarian strategies, Conrad and Kaul
(1998) also found that the optimum profit occurred during the 3- to 12-month horizon. In addi-
tion, they found that a contrarian strategy (buying the lows) only had statistically significant
profits during the period 1926 through 1947.
Of course, other academics immediately criticized the study for any number of possible
reasons, but by the time of Conrad and Kaul’s paper, other doubts about market efficiency had
also been demonstrated, and the evidence was not rejected immediately as it had been with Levy
in the 1960s. Since then, the basis of their paper has been proven correct not only in foreign

countries but also in the period following the original paper in the United States, as reported in a
subsequent paper by Jegadeesh and Titman in 2001 in the Journal of Finance.
In 1998, Professor K. G. Rouwenhorst showed that momentum was successful in 12 Euro-
pean stock markets, and in 1999, he demonstrated that momentum was most strong in emerging
markets. Other studies confirm the existence of profitability from relative strength in China, Ger-
many, 8 different Asian markets (without Japan), and Switzerland. Even Professor Eugene Fama,
one of the originators of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, found that momentum was the only
anomaly to survive a multitude of tests (Fama and French, 1996). Academia has, thus, concluded
that the theory of relative price strength shows success not only in producing profits but also in
debunking part of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.
Various reasons have been proposed for the existence of relative strength, none of which
has been proven. The most logical has to do with behavioral tendencies of investors and the flow
of information. An excellent discussion of the behavioral model describing investor underreac-
tion and overreaction is Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997). However, we are not concerned
with why relative strength is valid. Our only concern is that over a period of three to six months,
using relative strength is a viable strategy and is, thus, a reliable means of selecting stocks.
Measuring Relative Strength
ptg
Given the importance of relative strength, the technical analyst needs a method for measuring it.
A number of methods of measuring relative strength exist, the most popular being the percentage
change, the alpha, the trend slope, and the Levy methods.
Percentage Change Method
In their study, Jegadeesh and Titman used a six-month price change as their basic lookback cal-
culation. “Lookback” is the period over which relative price strength is calculated. The stocks
then were sorted based on these rates of change. They found that the higher decile stocks contin-
ued to be strong for the next three to ten months. Their sample included both large capitalized
and thinly capitalized and both high-priced and low-priced stocks. All performed similarly both
in the original experiment and in the subsequent out-of-sample tests.
BOX 21.2 CALCULATION OF ALPHA FOR AAPL
The graph in Figure 21.10 shows the scatter plot of weekly changes in AAPL (Apple
Computer stock) and the S&P 500 index. The linear regression line through the scat-
ter plot can be defined by its beta (1.60) and its alpha (1.55). Beta represents how
volatile AAPL is relative to the S&P. AAPL’s beta of 1.6 implies that AAPL stock
will oscillate on a weekly basis 60% more than the S&P. The alpha of 1.55 indicates
that AAPL has been outperforming the S&P by 1.55% on average over the 52 weeks
in the plot. It thus has a positive alpha and is a strong stock. Comparing AAPL’s
alpha to that of other stocks is a way to determine which are the strongest and best
candidates for investment. For a more thorough explanation of linear regression, see
Appendix A, “Basic Statistics.”

FIGURE 21.10 Alpha and beta of AAPL versus Standard & Poor’s 500, weekly
Alpha Method
A number of different methods of calculating relative strength have been developed. One is the
alpha method. In the beta theory of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), stock prices are compared
with an average, usually the S&P 500, weekly, over a year (and sometimes with different time
intervals and period). The weekly percentage change in the stock price is plotted versus the
weekly percentage change in S&P 500, and a linear regression line is drawn through these plots
on a best-fit basis. The line so defined is expressed using the slope of the line, called the beta,
and the intercept with the vertical axis, called the alpha. Thus, each stock over a specified period
has an alpha and a beta. Traditionally, beta has been used as a measure of volatility relative to the
S&P 500 and considered a definition of volatility risk. Stocks that oscillated widely have a high
beta representing a steep slope in their regression line and, thus, demonstrate a proclivity to
swing widely about the S&P. The alpha describes the value when the regression line crosses the
0% change in the S&P and is, thus, a measure of the trend relative to the S&P 500. MPT sug-
gested that high beta stocks would be more profitable but would also be more risky. What they
missed is that high beta stocks could also have negative alphas, suggesting that, while more
volatile, their trends relative to the S&P could be downward. In MPT, the alpha must always
either approach or be close to zero because, in theory, no systemic gain can come from the mar-
ket (the S&P 500) itself. In other words, a stock’s price motion is determined by beta, not alpha.

520 Part VII Selection
Alpha is not considered of any importance. However, in actual markets, alpha does not remain at
the zero level and has, thus, become a measure of how much better or worse the stock is perform-
ing relative to the S&P. When alpha is compared among stocks, it provides a relative strength
measure, and stock lists can be ranked by alpha to show which issues are the strongest. Alpha
will change more frequently and more widely than beta, but beta is somewhat irrelevant to the
relative price strength and has been largely discarded, even as a measure of volatility.
Trend Slope Method
Rather than go through the more complicated calculation of alpha and beta, another method of
screening for relative price strength is to calculate the slope of the price curve in percentage
terms over a specified period through a linear regression formula for each stock. The stocks can
then be ranked by the slopes of their price curves. This method is similar to the alpha method and
to the Jegadeesh and Titman method. It is easier to calculate than the alpha method and does not
suffer from the drop-off effect of a rate-of-change calculation beginning at an arbitrary price.
Levy Method
Robert Levy introduced a method of calculating relative strength in his 1965 paper. Levy first
calculated the ratio of the stock’s current price to its 131 trading-day moving average. He then ptg
ranked this ratio against the same ratio for all other stocks.
Levy found, as did Jegadeesh and Titman later, that the screen for relative strength should
be calculated on performance of the stock over a six-month lookback period. Anything shorter
tended to give multiple whipsaws in postcalculation performance, and anything longer tended to
be too close to when the performance began to regress back to its mean. Levy also found that
when the overall stock market headed downward into a lengthy bear market, relative strength
continued to be reliable but gradually lost its ability to pick winning stocks, and when the final
decline, the washout, occurred, those stocks having been relatively the strongest usually declined
the most. In his estimation, relative strength was, thus, a bull market selection process and should
not be used when the stock market declines.
One of the authors has tested the method live over 17 years (Kirkpatrick, 2001) using 26-
weeks as the lookback period and found it still provides a consistent list of winning stocks. 26
weeks is close enough to Levy’s original 131 days and can be substituted in the ratio to make the
calculation easier.

William O’Neil CANSLIM Method
CANSLIM is an acronym for a method of picking stocks to buy, devised by William O’Neil
(2002), publisher of Investor’s Business Daily. The data and ratings for each stock are included
in a subscription to that newspaper. The breakdown of CANSLIM is as follows:
C—Current quarterly earnings per share versus a year earlier
A—Annual earnings increases
N—New products, management, and stock price highs
S—Supply and demand of stock
L—Leader or laggard
I—Institutional sponsorship
M—Market direction
We, as technical analysts, are only concerned with L and M. The other selection criteria are
useful but not in the domain of this book. To determine L, leader or laggard, O’Neil calculates
the 12-month percentage price change of every stock, weighted more heavily over the most
ptg
recent 3 months, and ranks each stock in percentiles from 99 to 0, with 99 being the strongest. He
has not divulged the exact formula, but as we know from academic studies and others, the exact
calculation is less important than the lookback time over which price change is measured. This
method is on the long side at 12 months, about the time when a strong stock begins to revert to
its moving average. The weighting over the past 3 months reduces the overall time for compari-
son and, therefore, improves the prospects of price strength continuing. O’Neil found that the
average relative strength percentile, by his calculation, was 87 before large upward moves.
For M, market direction, O’Neil refuses to listen to newsletters and “gurus” and refuses to
use economic data because it lags behind the market. He has a number of specific indicators and
patterns he watches for signs that a market is bottoming. He believes that the buy-and-hold
method is faulty because the widely held belief that all stocks will recover after a bear market is
a myth.
James P. O’Shaughnessy Method
Not surprisingly, James O’Shaughnessy, the president of O’Shaughnessy Capital Management in
Greenwich, Connecticut, found in studying 43 years of fundamental and price data that most
investment strategies are mediocre at best and that traditional investment management does not
work. He studied market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-book ratios, price-to-
cash flow ratios, price-to-sales ratios, dividend yields, earnings changes, profit margins, and
return on equity. He found that relative price strength, out of all the possible variables, funda-
mental and technical, was the only “growth variable that consistently beats the market” (1997).
O’Shaughnessy’s calculation of relative strength is similar to O’Neil’s in that it takes a
ratio of the year-end price to the price one year prior. It is, thus, a 12-month relative price
strength measure, a slightly longer-term calculation considering the history of relatively strong

stocks remaining strong. O’Shaughnessy developed from his testing of data from December 31,
1954, through December 31, 1995, a multifactor investment strategy model called the Corner-
stone Growth Strategy. It includes a primary screen for stocks with a price-to-sales ratio below
1.5, earnings greater than the previous year, and of those selected so far, the top 50 stocks in rel-
ative price strength.
Charles D. Kirkpatrick Method
Charles Kirkpatrick (2002), coauthor of this book, has long had a model similar to that of
O’Shaughnessy. The principal differences are threefold. First, in working with Robert Levy in
the late 1960s, he discovered the importance of relating all ratios to each other. Thus, in using the
price-to-sales ratio, he calculates the relative price-to-sales ratio of all stocks. Second, Kirk-
patrick uses the Levy calculation of relative price strength over six months in line with Levy’s
original work and that of later studies showing the importance of that period for postcalculation
continuation of price strength (see Figure 21.11). A multifactor investment strategy is developed
using the relative rankings of each of the preceding factors. This method has outperformed the
S&P 500 over the past 27 years in live weekly reporting by better than four to one.

Value Line Method
The Value Line Ranking System (www.valueline.com) has an extraordinary history of outper-
forming the stock market. Value Line claims that its Timeliness Ranking system has outper-
formed the Standard & Poor’s 500 by 16 to 1 since 1965. Although the company will not divulge
its method of calculation, it does admit that a significant portion of it includes a calculation of
relative price strength. Other factors include earnings trends, recent earnings, and earnings sur-
prises. Value Line charges a fee for its stock services.
Richard D. Wyckoff Method
A method of profiting from the stock market using technical analysis and relative price strength
that has stood the test of over 80 years is the method taught by Richard DeMille Wyckoff begin-
ning in 1931.
Richard Wyckoff, now considered a legend and one of the most important proponents of
technical analysis, began his long career in Wall Street as a runner in 1888 when he was only 15
years old. He organized his own brokerage firm by the time he was 25. From his brokerage firm,
he published a daily newsletter that evolved into a magazine called the Magazine of Wall Street.
Motivated by seeing “appalling losses in securities suffered annually by millions of people who
do not realize what they are risking and have an amazingly small knowledge of the market” (Hut-
son, 1986), in 1910, under the pen name “Rollo Tape,” Wyckoff described many important
aspects of the stock market in a book titled Studies in Tape Reading. His observations then are
still valid today. Before retiring for health reasons in 1928, his subscriber list exceeded 200,000
names, and later, when he returned to Wall Street in the early 1930s, he wrote many books on the
subject of profiting from the stock market and developed a correspondence course.

Current Relative Price Strength Percentile
Chart of the relationship between the current relative price strength percentile (independent variable) and rela-
tive price strength percentile three months later (dependent variable). The relationship is strong. The dark,
straight line (actual data) fits closely to the dark, dashed line (expected data) and has a relatively steep slope
of 0.326. This suggests that for every increased point in relative price strength percentile, the results increased
by close to a third of a point. Its R2 is high at 0.893, suggesting that the relationship is relatively close to per-
fect, which would be 1.000. It is positive, which suggests the higher the current relative price strength per-
centile, the higher will be the relative price strength percentile three months later. The best three-month
performance comes from the highest level of current relative price strength percentile.

Wyckoff believed most strongly that stock prices were determined solely by “supply and
demand.” He had little use for “tips, rumors, news items, earnings analyses, financial reports,
dividend rates, and the myriad of other sources of information” or the “half-baked trading theo-
ries expounded in boardrooms and popular books on the stock market” (Wyckoff in Hutson,
1986). He was a true technical analyst, and a very successful one. He believed that the markets

were influenced mostly by wealthy individuals and informed insiders. Substituting “institutions”
today for these players, we find that the situation has not changed. By understanding what these
capital pools were doing in the markets, one could profit by following them. Their capital moved
the markets, right or wrong, and the small investor could take advantage of this movement by
understanding how to gauge it.
Wyckoff’s tools were many of the methods described in this book. He used bar charts
(called “vertical charts”) and point-and-figure charts (called “figure charts”). He measured rela-
tive strength for both long and short positions, used volume as a means of testing the best time to
consider acting, required stop orders be entered with any action order, used trend lines to deter-
mine direction, used composite indexes, used group indexes, and believed that timing of entry
and exit was the most important variable in success. Support and resistance, reversal points
(called “danger points”), and horizontal counts from figure charts were important to his method.
In short, he used about everything you have learned so far. He believed that attempting to fit the
market into a formula or specific pattern was futile because no two markets are the same. The
market, he believed, traveled in waves—small ones evolving into larger ones in either direc-
tion—and that these waves could be detected and even anticipated, but they followed no certain,
mathematical path. Consequently, although his method had some organization, it required judg-
ment and experience.
Wyckoff’s progression of selecting stocks was as follows: ptg
1. To determine the direction of the entire market, Wyckoff devised an index called the Wyck-
off Wave that was a composite of the most widely held and active stocks. This was his
proxy for the market. Preferably, the stocks in the index were the ones that the investor or
trader was interested in trading. His concept of trend was to watch trend lines drawn on the
Wave chart and on charts of the composite market.
2. To select the stocks in harmony with the market, Wyckoff selected stocks that were strong
in upward trends and weak in downward trends. He believed that it was futile to act against
the trend. His calculation of relative price strength used the percentage changes from wave
highs to lows and lows to highs of each stock versus those of the Wyckoff Waves. Those
stocks that consistently outperformed in each Wave in the direction of the longer Wave
trend were the ones to analyze further.
3. To determine the potential of those selected so far, Wyckoff used the point-and-figure hor-
izontal count. At the same time, a stop level was established, and for the stock to be consid-
ered further, a three-to-one ratio of potential gain to potential stop loss was necessary.
4. To determine if the stock is ready to move, shorter-term considerations were needed to
analyze the nature of its price action. To do this, Wyckoff relied on volume, range, and to
some extent, short-term momentum. This portion of his method relied heavily on experi-
ence and judgment.
5. To time the entry, Wyckoff based his decision on the turning in the overall market. His
basis for this principle was that most stocks move with the market direction, and to time
with the market change just reduces the risk of error.

Chapter 21 Selection of Markets and Issues: Trading and Investing 525
CONCLUSION
Trading is often focused on very few issues because each must be watched very closely and
intently. Selecting the issues most suitable for a trader depends on many factors having to do
with the trader’s time horizon, liquidity, volatility, preferred market, technical methods, operat-
ing costs, and risk tolerance. Those traders who look for special opportunities in the market
rather than concentrate on a small number of issues are often swing traders who hold their posi-
tions for a few days or weeks. They use screens based principally on technical action such as pat-
terns, gaps, breakouts from prior highs and lows, and changes in volume or volatility to select
issues. Their equipment is able to scan through large numbers of issues looking for such indica-
tions of trend change. As might be expected, these methods are not often used by amateurs
because they must be followed each day all day, though swing trading setups can often be recog-
nized at night and orders placed for the next day while the trader is otherwise occupied.
In investment selection, as in fundamental screening for issues in which to invest, technical
screening can begin with the overall picture, the top-down approach, or it can begin right with
the individual issues in the markets that the investor is most interested in, the bottom-up
approach. Of course, rather than analyze economics and company financial data, the technical
analyst regards the price action of the areas of interest. In the top-down approach, the analyst
ptg
begins with the long, secular period of economic activity and studies the relative action of the
four basic investment segments—currencies, materials prices, interest rates, and stock markets.
From the results of that analysis, the analyst can then further analyze the sectors of those markets
showing the most promise. At all times, focus is placed on the best-acting areas for investment
because they have consistently been shown to continue with such strength, similar to the behav-
ior of trends on an absolute basis. The bottom-up approach is most often accomplished specifi-
cally for the stock markets because they have so many different issues from which to choose.
This analysis is likewise centered around what is called relative strength to determine the best
acting issues over a specified past lookback period, usually around six months, with anticipation
that those selected issues will continue to outperform over the following year. Relative strength
has been widely tested both in academia and in practice and has shown consistent reliability.

•
The importance of using a system for trading or investing
•
The difference between a discretionary and a nondiscretionary system

The mind-set and discipline required to develop and trade with a system

The basic procedures for designing a system

Standard measures of system profitability and risk
We have covered most of the methods used by technical analysts to analyze the trading markets.
We now enter into the field of how to utilize this knowledge to produce profits and reduce risk.
Any constant and consistent management of assets requires money management, which we cover
in the next chapter, and some type of system. Haphazardly investing or trading on intuition,
rumor, or untested theories is a road to disaster. It is why most amateur traders and investors lose
money.
A fundamental investor may use price-to-earnings, debt ratios, and so forth, whereas a
technical investor will likely use relative strength, price trend, or volatility, and both investors
will believe they are doing the correct analysis. They are not. In both cases, the methods may be
correct, but making money requires a tested system. There are many myths in investing, and
most investors succumb to them without further analysis. To trade or invest successfully, we need
to know not only how profitable a method has been, but also what the risks of capital loss were.
Not having an understanding of tested methods is flying blind in the financial markets. How do
we test these methods? We create a system. The system must include not only the method for
profit but also the means of controlling risk of loss. Both aspects of investing are extremely

important. Some would argue that controlling loss is even more important than the profit method,
that by buying and selling at the flip of a coin, one could make a decent return just by controlling
risk of loss.
Let us begin this chapter by looking a little more closely at what a system is. Then, we
focus on what risk is and how to control losses. Once we have these foundations, we can focus on
the mechanics of developing a system and testing investment strategies.
WHY ARE SYSTEMS NECESSARY?
No stock market goes up forever. Indeed, most world stock markets have declined to zero at one
time or another. The buy-and-hold strategy so popular in the U.S. today is based on a statistical
anomaly. It is a strategy based on a survival bias in the U.S. and the U.K. markets, the only coun-
tries in history, so far, whose markets have not completely disappeared at some time (Burnham,
2005). This has caused a misleading assumption that U.S. stocks and stocks in general will nec-
essarily continue to rise. “It would be naïve to expect the future of U.S. stocks to be as bright as
the past” (Burnham, 2005, p 175).
ptg
We certainly know that individual stocks can go to zero. How about buggy whips in 1910,
or canals in 1830, or bowling in 1950, or junk bonds and REITs in 1980, or more recently the
autos and the banks? Thus, a long-term plan that excludes a means of controlling risk is eventu-
ally doomed.
On the other hand, most technical and fundamental methods, by themselves, are not prof-
itable over time either. Some of the exceptions have been covered earlier in this book, but these
methods primarily depend upon the market circumstances at the time, on the method used, and
on controlling risk. Traders’ and investors’ greatest misconception is that the market has order
and that by finding and acting on that order, profits will be consistent and large. It presumes that
a magic formula exists somewhere that can predict markets. This belief is not true. In looking at
the previous studies in this book, there is no magic order to the markets beyond the fact that they
sometimes trend and, more often, remain in trading ranges. The money made is based on the use
of well-controlled entries and exits, especially those that limit the amount of loss that can occur
and that will react to changing conditions in the market. A system will aid the investor or trader
in timing these market entries and exits.
Discretionary Versus Nondiscretionary Systems
Systems are the next step in the development of an investment plan after understanding the meth-
ods of either technical or fundamental investing. Systems can be discretionary, nondiscretionary,
or a combination of both. In discretionary systems, entries and exits are determined by intuition;
in other words, the trader or investor exercises some discretion in making trades. Nondiscre-
tionary systems are those in which entries and exits are determined mechanically by a computer.
Think for a minute of the stereotypical discretionary trader. Imagine the ultimate discre-
tionary trader behaving like the man in the antacid advertisement with two or three phones
yelling, “buy” in one, “sell” in another, with computer screens showing prices and charts of secu-
rities all over the world, with ringing phones, with news broadcasts from financial TV stations,

and with a large contact list of people in different specialties. This type of trader is generally
looking for the home run. It is a great image, one that has in it a bit of the swashbuckler, the gun-
slinger, and so on. In fact, many truly exceptional traders are like this. They have the gifted intu-
ition to be able to do this consistently and profitably.
Most people, however, do not have the time, the knowledge, the contacts, the equipment,
the quickness of thought, or the stomach to do this. In fact, most people who attempt to trade like
this either burn out or go broke. They have no way of evaluating what they are doing except from
the equity in their account at the end of the day. It is as if the excitement is more important than
making profits.
The nondiscretionary trader, on the other hand, is usually calm, calculating, and likely
bored. The majority of successful traders and investors use nondiscretionary systems (Etzkorn
interview of Babcock, 1996). Some have been engineers; others have that type of mind, familiar
with statistics and systems. They have studied the markets, the methods of profit making—both
fundamental and technical—and have tested the techniques using modern statistical methods.
They understand that nothing is perfect and that markets change character over time. However,
by testing their methods and strategies, they have derived a mechanical system that minimizes
risk of loss and maximizes return.
Rules are the structure of a system. An example of a rule would be “buy when one moving ptg
average crosses above another.” Variables are the quantities used in the rules—two moving aver-
ages, and parameters are the actual values used in the variables—two days and seven days. A sys-
tem will include all these factors, and their usefulness is determined by testing different rules,
variables, and parameters over varied markets and market conditions.
A purely nondiscretionary system is one that runs by itself on market data that is continu-
ally fed into it. If our rule is to buy when the two-day moving average crosses above the seven-
day moving average, for example, a buy order automatically is placed when this occurs. Once the
trader has determined the rule to follow, the system is on autopilot and the trader does not make
decisions.
A trader or investor can also choose to use a partial discretionary system. The partial dis-
cretionary system is one that generates signals that then are acted upon by the investor based on
personal confidence in them and experience with them. By having some discretion, however, the
system cannot be tested accurately because emotion can enter into the trading decisions and
cause unquantifiable errors.
Is it always better to choose a nondiscretionary, mechanical system over a discretionary
one? Let us look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.
Benefits of a Nondiscretionary, Mechanical System
A nondiscretionary, mechanical system provides a mathematical edge as determined by testing
and adjusting. This is the principle behind the casino and an insurance business, both of which
profit from many small profitable trades and occasional losses.
Using a nondiscretionary system avoids emotion. This is an advantage because traders
often lose money due to emotional decisions. The nondiscretionary system also reduces other
trading pitfalls—overtrading, premature action, no action, and constant decision making. Trad-
ing with a properly designed mechanical system also prevents large losses and risk of ruin, which

532 Part VIII System Testing and Management
most traders have never quantified or understood. In fact, risk control can be one of the most
important advantages of a mechanical system.
Trading with a nondiscretionary system also provides certainty, develops confidence, and
produces less stress. Anxiety comes from uncertainty. Although a nondiscretionary system can-
not predict the future, it can structure how to react to possible outcomes. It gives a list of
responses to events beyond one’s control.
Pitfalls to a Nondiscretionary, Mechanical System
Though there are many benefits to a nondiscretionary, mechanical system, pitfalls also exist. For
one, extrapolating will not have the same results as tests; history does not repeat itself precisely.
The more a system is optimized or curve-fitted, the less reliable it will be in the future. In fact, in
their book, The Ultimate Trading Guide, Hill, Pruitt, and Hill (2000) suggest that you should
generally expect half the profits and twice the drawdowns as shown in tests of past data. Having
been tested, the system designer expects results that are often unrealistic. The designer must be
careful not to lose confidence when unrealistic expectations are not achieved.
Nondiscretionary systems often will make profits in clumps, especially if it is a trend-fol-
lowing system. The trader then loses small amounts waiting for the next clump and protecting
ptg
from large losses. In other words, great creativity may have gone into inventing the system, but
its operation is boring. In addition, some system designs allow large drawdowns but still eventu-
ally produce profits. The emotional problem for the user is the wait for the drawdown to be
recovered and meanwhile the possible loss of confidence in the system. A loss of confidence
results in fiddling with the rules or giving up just as the system is about to kick in.
Although a good system adjusts to a changing market, it does require periodic updates.
This can often be a source of confusion for the designer. Is it time to update an underperforming
system because of a changing marketplace? Alternatively, is the lackluster performance period a
time for the trader to sit by patiently waiting for the system to kick in? The answers to these ques-
tions are not always obvious.
Remember that the system falls apart if it is not followed precisely. This is what the testing
was for, and violations of the rules established from the testing negate the value of the system.
This requires considerable discipline.
Using a nondiscretionary, mechanical system is not easy—otherwise, everyone would do
it. There is a lot of work in coming up with a system, testing it, adjusting it, and trying it correctly
and convincingly. The tendency for many people is to “wing it” and see if it works. That method
leaves the trader nowhere.
HOW DO I DESIGN A SYSTEM?
Now you are convinced that you need to design a system for trading. However, how do you do
that? Let us look at some of the requirements and steps involved in creating an effective system.
Requirements for Designing a System
What is needed to design a successful system? Before even considering the components of a sys-
tem, we must begin with something even more basic—designing a workable, profitable system

Chapter 22 System Design and Testing 533
begins with some basic personal attitudes. Some of the characteristics of the necessary mind-set
include the following:
• Understand what a discretionary or nondiscretionary system will do—be realistically
knowledgeable, and lean toward a nondiscretionary, mechanical system that can be
quantified precisely and for which rules are explicit and constant.
• Do not have an opinion of the market. Profits are made from reacting to the market,
not by anticipating it. Without a known structure, the markets cannot be predicted. A
mechanical system will react, not predict.
• Realize that losses will occur—keep them small and infrequent.
• Realize that profits will not necessarily occur constantly or consistently.
• Realize that your emotions will tug at your mind and encourage changing or fiddling
with the system. Such emotions must be controlled.
• Be organized—winging it will not work.
• Develop a plan consistent with one’s time available and investment horizon—daily,
ptg
weekly, monthly, and yearly.
• Test, test, and test again, without curve-fitting. Most systems fail because they have
not been tested or have been overfitted.
• Follow the final tested plan without exception—discipline, discipline, discipline. No
one is smarter than the computer, regardless of how painful losses may be, and how
wide spreads between price and stops may affect one’s staying power.
Understanding Risk
When we set out to create a system, we are usually concentrating on profits. Remember our
underlying objective is to make profits. However, we must be careful not to focus so much on
earning profits that we forget about the critical concept of risk.
The amateur investor or trader usually uses a discretionary system. Testing and analyzing
and evolving a workable nondiscretionary system takes too much time, knowledge, experience,
and thought. Most people would rather just take the word of others and act spontaneously. Prof-
itable professionals, however, always have a system. Although they may use a discretionary sys-
tem, professionals know the results of investment action from experience and know the risks.
Successful professionals always apply some form of risk control, even if it is just a series of men-
tal stop-loss levels. Considering risk marks the difference between amateurs and professionals.
Those who consider profit potential and not risk are mostly amateurs, even if they think they are
professionals, and generally have or manage portfolios that considerably underperform the mar-
kets over the long term.
Risk is a vital concept, but what exactly is it? Academics have long characterized risk as
equivalent to volatility. As seen in Appendix A, “Basic Statistics,” the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) and options theory consider volatility not only an important variable in markets,

==================================================

534 Part VIII System Testing and Management
but also a measure of risk. These ideas are partially correct, but as anyone who has operated in
the markets knows, the real definition of risk is: “How much money am I going to lose?” This is
how the technical analyst focuses on risk.
The amount of money lost, or potentially lost, is called drawdown. It is defined as that
amount by which the equity in an account declines from a peak. In other words, a drawdown is
how much investors would suffer if they became invested in an account at its peak value. In a
specific trade, the drawdown also can be defined as the amount that the trade value declines
between the entry and the exit, even if the exit is above the entry and produces a final profit.
Drawdown is sometimes referred to as the “pain” of holding a position. Although volatility can
contribute to drawdown, as we will see later in looking at the smoothness of equity curves, the
major concern for any investor or trader is the amount that can be lost.
Remember how we saw in Chapter 21, “Selection of Markets and Issues: Trading and
Investing,” that a 50% decline requires a 100% advance to return to even and that a 100% gain
can be wiped out with only a 50% loss. We can see a bit more of the mathematics of this phenom-
enon in Appendix A where we consider the geometric mean, which in this case would be 0%.
This law of percentages is against the investor. Thus, a profit and a loss are not equivalent. A
minor loss always requires a larger gain to offset it. The purpose in quantifiable systems is to
minimize that potential loss. ptg
Risk to the investor or trader in the markets also includes many intangibles. Loss comes
not only from asset loss but also from emotional loss. Nothing is more disturbing to the psyche
than losing money and at the same time being proven wrong. Both these risks can be reduced by
systems. Losing money can be prevented through proper exit strategies, and the emotional loss
can be alleviated through the confidence that although one may make small mistakes, one’s
equity curve continues upward. A well-devised and well-understood system can produce that
confidence, making small losses just an inconvenience rather than a traumatic event.
Initial Decisions
Once you are committed to the mind-set and discipline of creating a system, you must make cer-
tain decisions about the characteristics of your system. The actual fundamental or technical
method used as the basis for the system is relatively unimportant. What is important is that what-
ever is used can be defined precisely. Most fundamental and technical methods, by themselves,
have a sketchy record of performance. Performance in the system will depend more on filters,
adjustments, and the entry and exit strategies than the method itself. This does not mean that any
old method will work. Pick one that is familiar, comfortable, sensible, and has a decent record;
then concentrate on the process.
Most systems designers argue that the simpler the system, the better. A system can become
bogged down with large numbers of conditions and statistically will lose degrees of freedom,
requiring more data and more signals to establish its significance. Some designers such as
Richard Dennis argue against simplicity (Collins, 2005), but they have enormous computer
power and knowledge behind them. Hill and others argue that even with modern technology and
mathematics, the success of systems now is no greater than the classic systems designed with a
hand or crank calculator.

The first decision that must be made is that of trading philosophy and premises. In other
words, you must decide what kind of input and method is to be used to generate signals. Some
investors depend on fundamental information; most traders depend on technical methods. Others
use a combination. The important aspect is to have a clear understanding of the system’s prem-
ises and to know that the rules will be easily quantifiable and precise. Specificity is much easier
to use and to test than generality. You must also understand the logic of the system and be sure
that it suits your style of trading or investing.
Second, you must decide on which markets to focus. Is the market suitable for the intended
system? Are there opportunities for diversification between markets or instruments? How much
volatility and liquidity is required, and what specific instruments will be traded?
Third, you must establish the time horizon for the system. For example, most trend-follow-
ing systems work better over longer periods, but most pattern systems work in hours and days.
Does the system intend to scalp trades, swing trade, or long-term invest? In addition, what is the
psychologically best-suited time not only for system logic but also for ease of use? Do you have
time to spend all day with the system, or can you monitor the system only daily, weekly, or
monthly?
Fourth, you must have a risk control plan; otherwise, you will not know what to do when
markets change. Understand that losses are inevitable, but be sure to keep them under control. ptg
Admitting losses separates the professional from the amateur. Rationalizing or excusing losses
never helps. The market is never wrong—get out, the quicker the better. To do this, devise a stop-
loss strategy—“no clinging to the mast of the sinking ship.” This strategy should include protec-
tive and trailing stops, price targets, and adjustments for volatility, type of market, and any other
state that the market might be in. Otherwise, the account may suffer a larger loss. Emotions and
judgment become adversely affected, causing missed opportunities, selling profitable positions
to get even, and other mistakes. Stop-losses free up nonproductive capital and cause less stress
once accepted. A good rule of thumb for maximum risk per trade is 2% of capital. This 2% is the
difference between the entry price and the stop price.
Fifth, establish a time routine, which should include when to update the system and neces-
sary charts, plan new trades, and update exit points for existing trades. As part of your system
administration, maintain a trader’s notebook, a trader’s diary, and a daily equity chart.
Types of Technical Systems
Technical analysts use a number of types of technical trading systems. Although there are numer-
ous systems, they can be divided into four main categories: trend following, pattern recognition,
countertrend, and exogenous signals systems.
Trend Following
From our knowledge of technical systems, we understand that markets trend at times and trade in
a range at other times. The most profitable background is a trending background because the
moves are larger and generate fewer transaction costs. It is no wonder, then, that trend-following
nondiscretionary systems have been the most productive. Most large-scale mechanical system
hedge funds and commodity trading advisors use trend-following systems. Rather than attempt-
ing to catch the peaks and valleys, the trend-following system acts in the direction of the trend as

soon after it has begun as can be reliably detected. Contrary to the buy low and sell high philos-
ophy, the trend-following system will buy high and sell higher. Schwager believes that slower,
longer trend systems work better because the gains are larger, though less frequent, and the whip-
saws are minimal. Most trend-following systems add a trend indicator such as the ADX to their
set of rules to be sure that a trend is in existence. However, as we know from earlier studies on
trends, the performance of a trend-following system can suffer during a trading range market.
Moving Average Systems
The classic trend-following system is composed of two moving averages that generate signals
when they cross over each other. In his book, The Definitive Guide to Futures Trading, Larry
Williams discusses how as early as the 1940s, Donchian demonstrated the validity of this method
and showed that it was more successful than the older system of using price versus a single mov-
ing average.
If two moving averages are better than one, would three be even better? No, studies have
shown that adding more moving averages weakens performance because of the increased num-
ber of rules required. Although practitioners frequently report success using moving averages,
we must mention that academic studies have shown that moving average crossover systems, even
with simple filters, are generally unprofitable. However, academics have not used any kind of ptg
risk control in their experiments. Without the use of these important risk-control strategies, the
academic studies are not a true measure of the profitability of using a moving average crossover
system.
Breakout Systems
A variation of the trend-following system is the breakout system. These systems generate buy
and sell signals when price moves out of a channel or band. The most popular of these systems is
based on a variation of the Donchian channel breakout system or some kind of volatility break-
out system using Bollinger Bands or other measures of range volatility. The breakout system can
be long term and use weekly figures, or short term, such as the open range breakout systems used
intraday.
Problems with Trend-Following Systems
Given their profitability, the moving average and breakout strategies are popular. Because many
of these trend-following systems are being traded, many others will receive the same signal at
roughly the same time and price you will. Liquidity can become strained, and slippage costs
from wider spreads and incomplete fills will increase the transaction costs over what may have
been anticipated. The solution to this problem is to devise an original system or to spread out or
scale entry orders.
Another problem with trend-following systems is that whipsaws are common, especially
during a trading range market, as the system attempts to identify the trend. In fact, trend-follow-
ing systems often produce less than 50% wins because of the many whipsaws during ranging
markets. This problem can be reduced with the use of confirmations, such as special price
requirements (penetration requirement, time delay, and so on), once a signal has been given, or
through filters and diversification into uncorrelated markets.

==================================================

Chapter 22 System Design and Testing 537
Inevitably, to avoid whipsaws, a trend-following system will be late in the trend and will
thus miss profit potential at both ends of the trend. Unfortunately, this is the cost of a trend-fol-
lowing system. If an attempt is made to clip more profit at each end of the trend, the number of
losses will increase from the ranging nature of the trend at its terminal points. On the exit side of
a trend, specific trailing stops or such can be used to receive better prices, but again there is the
risk of missing another leg in the trend by exiting prematurely.
Losses occur primarily in the trading range preceding the establishment of a trend, as the
system tries to identify the next trend as closely as possible. One strategy to combat this is to use
a countertrend system at the same time, even if it is not as profitable as the trend-following sys-
tem. The gains from the countertrend system will offset some of the losses of the trend-following
system, and the overall performance results will improve over the trend-following system alone.
Moving-average and breakout systems are usually limited to a one-directional signal only.
Part of the advantage in following a trend is to pyramid in the direction of the trend as evidence
of its viability becomes stronger. To accomplish this in a trend-following system, other indicators
must be used, thus increasing the complexity and decreasing the adaptability of the system.
The greatest fault with trend-following systems is the large percentage of consecutive
small losses that produce significant drawdowns. For example, let us say that the system suffers
ten small losses in a row while in a trading range. The drawdown to the equity of the account ptg
accumulates during this period from the peak of the equity to the subsequent cumulative loss. A
series of losses that cause a large drawdown affect not only the pocketbook but also the confi-
dence in the system and often lead to further complications. One strategy to lessen a sequence of
losses is the strategy mentioned previously of using a countertrend system. Another is to initiate
only small positions on a signal until the trend is well established. Yet another is to run another
trend-following system parallel that has a longer or shorter period.
Because a trend-following system often is characterized by clumps of large profits from
the trend and many small losses from the trading range, extreme volatility occurs in equity. We
will look at this later when we study equity curve smoothness, but the most-often-used counter-
measure is to diversify into other markets or systems.
As with most mechanical systems, a trend-following system can work well during testing
and then bomb in practice. In most cases, this is due to improper testing and adjusting. Some-
times the improper testing is due to unrealistic assumption about transactions costs. Unrealistic
assumptions including spreads during fast markets, limit days in the futures market, and other
possible anomalies may have given false results during the testing stage of the system under con-
sideration. Remember that the popularity of trend-following systems can affect slippage; this fact
often is erroneously ignored in the testing phase.
Occasionally, substantial parameter shifts will occur that the adaptive system will not be
able to recognize and accommodate. Again, by diversifying by using more than one system, or
using market character adjustments to volatility, such problems can be reduced.
Pattern Recognition Systems
“Every ship at the bottom of the sea had plenty of charts” is attributed to noted systems trader Jon
Najarian (Patel, 1997). Using patterns requires considerable testing and overcoming the problem

538 Part VIII System Testing and Management
of defining patterns. Larger patterns do not succumb to easy computer recognition because of
their variable nature. System traders such as Larry Williams, Larry Connor, and Linda Raschke
use short patterns, some of which we discussed in Chapter 17, “Short-Term Patterns,” and limit
their exposure with specific position stops and price or time targets. Generally, such systems are
partially discretionary because they require some interpretation during the trade entry.
Countertrend Systems
Countertrend systems are based on the buy-low-sell-high philosophy within a trading range. This
type of system requires a certain amount of volatility between the peaks and valleys of ranges;
otherwise, transaction costs, missing limits, and being stopped out on false moves chew up any
potential profits. Generally, these systems are discretionary. They profit from fading minimum
moves against a trend and using oscillator indicators such as the stochastic, RSI, the MACD, or
cycles. The largest potential problem in trading with one of these systems is the possibility of a
trend developing that creates the risk of unlimited losses. Protective stops are a necessity.
Generally, this type of system does not perform well. A number of publicly available tests,
for example, of buying and selling within Bollinger Bands have been conducted, and invariably
the best performance comes from buying and selling on breakouts from the bands rather than
ptg
trading within them. The major use of countertrend systems is to run coincident with trend-fol-
lowing systems to dampen the series of losses in the trend-following system during a trading
range.
Exogenous Signal Systems
Some systems generate signals from outside the market being traded. Intermarket systems, such
as gold prices for the bond market, would be an example of an exogenous signal system. Other
examples are sentiment such as the VIX for S&P futures, volume, or open interest warnings of
activity that trigger price systems or act as confirmation of price systems, or fundamental signals
such as monetary policy or consumer prices.
Which System Is Best?
Which type of system is the best? John R. Hill and George Pruitt, whose business is to test all
manner of trading systems (www.futurestruth.com), maintain that the best and most reliable sys-
tems are trend-following systems. Within trend-following systems, the breakout systems have
the best characteristics, specifically the Bollinger Band breakout systems, and the Donchian, or
channel, breakout systems. Closely behind are the moving-average crossover systems.
HOW DO I TEST A SYSTEM?
Not surprisingly, for an accurate evaluation of any system, the data must be impeccable. Without
the correct data, the system tests are useless. Data should always be the same as what will be
used when the system is running in real time. Not only the data but also the data vendor should
be the same source as what will be used in practice. Different vendors receive different data

feeds. This is especially a problem in short-term systems, where the sequence of trades is impor-
tant for execution and for pattern analysis.
The amount of data required depends on the period of the system. A general rule of thumb
is that the data must be sufficient to provide at least 30 to 50 signals and cover periods where the
market traveled up, down, and sideways. This will ensure that the test has enough history behind
it and enough exposure to different market circumstances.
The real-time trader has enough difficulty with “dirty” data on a live feed, and this
becomes just as crucial when testing back data. Cleanliness of data is another very necessary
requirement. Any anomalies or mispriced quotes will have an effect on the system test and will
skew the results in an unrealistic manner. Cleaning of data is not an easy task and often must be
relegated to the professional data providers.
Special Data Problems for Futures Systems
Although stock data has a few historical adjustments such as dividend payments, splits, offer-
ings, and so on, the futures market has another more serious problem: which contract to test.
Most futures contracts have a limited life span that is short enough not to be useful in testing
most systems. The difficulty comes from the difference in price between the price at expiration ptg
and the price of the nearest contract on that date. Those prices are rarely the same and are diffi-
cult to splice into something realistic that can be used for longer-term price analysis. To test a
daily system, for example, two years or more of daily data is required at the very least, but no
contract exists that runs back for two years. Of course, testing can be done on nearest contract
series, but it is limited to the contract length. This is satisfactory if the system trades minute by
minute but not for daily signals in a longer-term system.
To rectify this problem, two principal methods of splicing contract prices of different expi-
rations together in a continuous stream have been used. These methods are known as perpetual
contracts and continuous contracts. Neither is perfect, but these methods are the ones most com-
monly used in longer-term price studies.
Perpetual contracts, also called constant forward contracts, are interpolations of the prices
of the nearest two contracts. Each is weighted based on the proximity to expiration of the nearest
contract to the forward date—say a constant 90 days. As an example, assume that today is early
December, only a few days from expiration of the December contract of a commodity future and
a little over three months from the expiration of the March contract, the next nearest. The 90-day
perpetual would be calculated by proportioning each contract’s current price by the distance each
is in time from the date 90 days from now. This weighting in early December favors the March
contract price, and each day as we approach the December expiration, the December contract
receives less weight until expiration when the perpetual is just the March contract price. The fol-
lowing day, however, the March contract price begins to lose weighting as the June contract price
begins to increase its weighting. This process gives a smooth but somewhat unrealistic contract
price; it eliminates the problem of huge price gaps at rollover points, but you cannot literally
trade a constant forward series. As Schwager points out, “the price pattern of a constant-forward
series can easily deviate substantially from the pattern exhibited by the actual traded contracts—
a highly undesirable feature” (1996, p. 664).

==================================================

540 Part VIII System Testing and Management
The continuous, or spread adjusted, contract is more realistic, but it suffers from the fact
that at no time is the price of the continuous contract identical to the actual price because it has
been adjusted at each expiration or each rollover date. The continuous contract begins at some
time in the past with prices of a nearby contract. A rollover date is determined based on the
trader’s usual rollover date—say ten days before expiration. Finally, a cumulative adjustment
factor is determined. As time goes on and different contracts roll over to the next contract, this
spread between contracts is accumulated and the continuous contract price adjusted accordingly.
With this method, the continuous prices are exactly what would have been the cost to the trader
had the system signals been followed when they occurred. There is no distortion of prices. Price
trends and formations occur just as they would have at the time. The only difference is that the
actual prices are not those in the continuous contract. Percentage changes, for example, are not
accurate. Nevertheless, the method demonstrates exactly what would have happened to a system
during the period of the continuous contract, precisely what the systems designer wants to know.
As Schwager points out, “a linked futures price series can only accurately reflect either
price levels, as does the nearest futures, or price moves as does continuous futures, but not
both…” (1996, p. 669). Students interested in trading futures can refer to the book, Schwager on
Futures: Technical Analysis, to learn more about these techniques.

Testing Methods and Tools
Fortunately, the wheel need not be reinvented when it comes to testing software. Many trading
software products include a testing section. Some are reliable; however, some are not. Before
purchasing any such software, you should understand the testing methods and resulting reports
of the software. Almost all such programs leave out crucial analysis data and may often define
terms and formulas differently from others. For example, the term “drawdown” has different
meanings, depending on intraday data, closing data, trade close data, and so forth. You must
understand the meaning of all terms in any software program to correctly interpret tests per-
formed by it. With this in mind, the systems analyst must establish exactly what information is
desired, what evaluation criteria would be useful, and how the results should be presented.
Test Parameter Ranges
The initial test of a system is run to see if the system has any value and, if so, where the problem
areas might lie. When the testing program is run, the parameters selected initially should be
tested to see if they fall in a range or are independent spikes that might or might not occur in the
future. A parameter range, called the parameter set, that gives roughly the same results bolsters
confidence in the appropriateness of the parameter value. If, when the parameter value is
changed slightly, the performance results deteriorate rapidly, the parameter will not likely work
in the future. It is just an aberration. When the results remain the same, or similar, the parameter
set is said to be stable—obviously a desirable characteristic.

BOX 22.1 DESIGNING A SYSTEM—THE “NERVES OF STEEL SYSTEM”
Let us look at a simple case study of how to develop a trading system. Suppose we
decide that we will trade U.S. Steel Corporation common stock (X), traditionally a
less volatile blue chip. We also decide that we will start with a simple Donchian
channel breakout system on weekly highs and lows data.
Looking at the monthly chart of X (see Figure 22.1) from 2000 through mid-
2010, we see many periods of upward and downward trends and trading ranges. This
is an ideal history to analyze and test because it includes the three possible trends in
any market: up, down, and sideways. It also covers a period more than nine years,
roughly 500 weeks, enough to give us plenty of signals.

The Donchian channel breakout system gives a buy signal when the weekly closing
price breaks above the highest price over the past 4 weeks. The sell signal occurs when the
weekly closing price breaks below the lowest price over the past 4 weeks. Some public
systems use 20 trading days, an approximation of 4 weeks, but we will be more conserva-
tive and wait for the weekly signals. We will use 4 weeks initially, the standard starting
point in this system. We will trade 100 shares of stock in each entry and exit. There will
initially be no stops or any other exit criteria other than the opposite signal. This is called a
“Stop and Reverse” (SAR) system, and funds are invested at all times, either long or short.
The equity curve for this system is shown in Figure 22.2. An equity curve is a chart
of the equity in the account (vertical axis) versus time measured either by trade number
or by time (horizontal axis). In Figure 22.2, time is along the horizontal axis. Looking at
the chart, we can see that system was unsuccessful for many years and only caught on in
2007 when the equity curve rose to the right as the theoretical portfolio gained from the
signals. It was not a steady ride, however, as several large drawdowns occurred, and a
ptg
majority of the profits came from one relatively short series of trades in 2008. We would
like to develop a variation of this method that gives us less drawdowns, perhaps more
profit, and a steady climb in profits over time. One of the difficulties of a widely swing-
ing equity curve is that the investor doesn’t know if the adverse swing is temporary or an
indication that something is wrong with the system. It is preferable, therefore, to dampen
the swings using various methods of capital risk control.

Let’s look at some of these statistics and learn what they tell us about the Nerves-
of-Steel system so far:
• Net profit is the difference between gross profit and gross loss. It is positive
for this system and gives the impression that the system has some merit.
• Gross profit and gross loss are the totals under each category for each trade.
Gross profit is the total profit from profitable trades; gross loss is the total from
all losing trades.
• The profit factor is the absolute value of the ratio of gross profit to gross loss.
It shows the profitability of the system. In this case, for every dollar of loss,
1.77 dollars of profit are generated. If the profit factor is less than one, the sys-
tem is losing (and net profit would be negative).

continued
• Looking at the number of trades, this system generated 74 trades: 37 long
trades and 37 short trades. This is a large enough number of trades for reliable
statistics. Generally, at least 30 to 50 trades are required to test a system.
• Percent profitable is the percent of all trades that were profitable. In our
example, only 39.2% of the trades were profitable. It is typical for a trend-fol-
lowing system to have less than 50% of the trades profitable. When a low per-
centage of the trades is profitable, it suggests many small losses and large
drawdowns—in other words, high risk. If we can increase the percentage of
profitable trades, we can lower the risk profile and reduce the risk of ruin.
• Average trade net profit is the average profit received per trade. If this is par-
ticularly small, it suggests that the system is vulnerable to transaction costs. In
this system, the average profit should cover any incidental costs.
• The largest winner or loser versus gross profit or gross loss figure gives a
ptg
hint as to whether the gain or loss was accounted for by only one trade. In this
case, the largest winning trade accounted for 36% of the total gross profit. On
the short side, the largest winner accounted for almost 70% of the gross profit.
Although this is characteristic of trend-following systems, which tend to make
profits in large but few clumps, it suggests that the system is highly dependent
on finding that one or two hugely profitable trades. Over a period of nine
years, it means that a lot of waiting will be done by the system user.
• The maximum consecutive losing trades is important because a long string
of consecutive losses invariably causes a large drawdown and, thus, a high
potential risk for the system. In this case, the number of successive losses is six
trades in a row. In trend-following systems, the number of successive losses is
usually high and is one reason that the systems user must have complete confi-
dence in the system.
• Considering the average weeks in winning and losing positions, there is not
much question that the Nerves-of-Steel system has produced many profits and
short-term losses but most likely for less than a year. From a capital gains tax
standpoint, this could cause an extra tax burden.
• Buy-and-hold return (154%) is the return gained if the investor bought the
stock on the first day and held it for the entire time period through all its gyra-
tions.
• Return on account (276%) is the total return on the minimum account size as
determined by the maximum drawdown. It should be compared to the buy-
and-hold return to see if the system outperforms a do-nothing approach. In this

Chapter 22 System Design and Testing 545
case, the system exceeded the do-nothing approach, which is a favorable sign.
Of course, such comparisons are not as easy as they look because the concept
of risk has not been introduced to either method. The buy-and-hold method has
infinite risk because the drawdown can be 100%, while the risk of the system
has been limited to a much smaller percentage.
• Average monthly return and standard deviation of the monthly return are
used to determine the volatility of returns. The average monthly return for this
system is $404.75, but it is highly volatile with a standard deviation of
$1,986.58. Ideally, a system should have a standard deviation less than five
times the monthly return. In this case, it is 4.90 times, just under the limit.
• The Sharpe ratio is a common measure of the return versus risk of a portfolio
or system. As we saw in Chapter 21, it is a ratio of return—in this case,
adjusted for the risk-free return of T-bills, to the standard deviation of return, a
proxy for risk. As we stated earlier, however, risk is not just variability, but is
also the risk of capital loss. The Sharpe ratio fails to account for drawdown and ptg
fails to account for skewed deviations of return. An investment that deviates
more to the upside, for example, will not be fairly represented by the Sharpe
ratio, which assumes a normal distribution. These problems are why system
designers shy away from the Sharpe ratio and have designed other ratios of
return to risk that are more realistic. In this system, the Sharpe ratio is close to
zero, suggesting that the return does not exceed the risk-free return of T-bills.
• Maximum drawdown is the maximum amount that the equity curve corrected
from a peak. Assuming the future returns remain similar to the period tested, it
is the likely maximum risk of capital loss from the system.
• Naturally, one wants a system that has no drawdown, but barring that, one
wants a system that has profits considerably higher than any drawdown poten-
tial. The current case has a percentage of 276%, a particularly favorable ratio
considering that this is the first try at the system. The standard is anything
above 200%, depending on the length of the period studied. In the current case,
the period is particularly long, and a higher net profit to maximum drawdown
should be expected. It, thus, becomes a gauge for comparing systems, and a
common ratio for that is the Net Profit as Percentage of Maximum Intraday
Drawdown (see Table 22.1).
The Nerves-of-Steel system shows promise. It has returned, in its raw state, over
1.8 times the buy-and-hold. However, it also has some problems, namely that took a
long time to get going, and once it did it was volatile and suffered from some large
drawdowns. We look next at ways to improve this system.

546 Part VIII System Testing and Management
OPTIMIZATION
Once you determine that the parameters in your system are valid, you may optimize the system.
Optimizing is simply changing the parameters of a system to achieve the best results. The most
important benefit of optimization is that the designer may find parameters that do not work under
any circumstances. If parameters do not work with the past data, it is highly likely they will not
work in the future. Thus, optimizing can eliminate useless rules and parameters.
Optimizing is also useful in determining whether certain types of stops are useful. Often
the designer finds that there is a limit—for example, to a protective stop—beyond which the stop
does not add to the system performance. Often, the distance of trailing stops is too close to the
last price, causing premature exits. These determinations can be analyzed more closely with opti-
mization.
Although it can be beneficial, optimization does come with hazards. With modern comput-
ers and sophisticated software, we can take any series of prices and find the best parameters for
any predefined system. The problem is that by doing such an optimization, we are just fitting the
data to a curve of results and have no idea whether the parameters we have derived will perform
in the future. Because the future is what we are attempting to control, most optimization is use-
ptg
less and even dangerous because it gives us a false sense of confidence.
The principal concern with optimization is the tendency to “curve-fit.” Curve-fitting occurs
when the optimization program finds the absolute best set of parameters. What the program is
really doing is fitting the parameters to the data that is being tested. Thus, it is forming a mathe-
matical model of that data and fitting parameters to that particular time in history. The only way
that the parameters will work in the future is if the future exactly duplicates the history that was
optimized. Of course, we know this will never happen and, thus, the parameters determined by
optimization will be useless in the future. Any system could be made to look profitable if opti-
mized; this is a problem that buyers of systems must face when considering purchasing an exist-
ing system for investing or trading. The trick is to optimize over a certain period and then test the
parameters derived through optimization on a period in which no optimization has been con-
ducted. This is called out-of-sample (OOS) testing. Invariably we will find that the results in the
optimization will overstate the results in the out-of-sample period and, thus, the optimized
parameters should never be used to evaluate the system’s usefulness. Optimization should be
kept simple. Fine-tuning the system just increases the level of false confidence that eventually
will be dashed in real time when the system fails.
There is, thus, some controversy about the use of optimization in arriving at workable
mechanical systems. The basic principles of realistic optimization are to keep it simple, test out-
of-sample data against in-sample optimization results, preferably use baskets of securities, deter-
mine parameter sets instead of single parameters, understand that the best results are high profits
with minimal risk, and do not expect to find the Holy Grail. Next, we discuss some optimization
methods and some tests for statistical significance to perform after the most realistic parameter
sets have been determined.
Methods of Optimizing
As a general rule, an optimization should be done over a considerable period of price data and
include those periods when the prices are in trends and in trading ranges. We do not know ahead

of time whether the future will be similar, but we do know that there will be trends and trading
ranges. Any system must be able to deal with both of these situations and have developed
adjustable parameter sets or rules that will account for them. Parameters determined in this man-
ner should be suitable for future conditions.
Whole Sample
One method of optimizing is to take the entire price sample and run an optimization of the
parameters. This is usually frowned upon because it is the closest to curve-fitting. To avoid this,
the optimization is on a basket of securities—either futures or stocks—rather than a market aver-
age or single issue and over a long enough period to generate a large number of trades. The diver-
sification of securities reduces the likelihood that any results are solely the result of peculiarities
in a particular security, and the large number of signals increases the statistical significance of
the results. After determining the optimal parameter sets, those that are consistent and give
decent results (but not necessarily the best results), the next step is to divide the optimization
period roughly into tenths and run a test on each period using the derived parameter sets. The
results from these ten different periods then can be analyzed for consistency to see if the system
generated similar results under all conditions. Things to look for are the amount of drawdowns,
ptg
the number of signals, the number of consecutive losses, the net profit as a percentage of maxi-
mum drawdown, and so on. The actual amount of net profit is less important for each stage than
are the determinants of risk and the consistency of results (Ruggiero, 2005). If the results are not
consistent, the system has a major problem and should be optimized using other means or dis-
carded.
Out-of-Sample Optimization (OOS)
This is a method most often used in neural network and regression studies. We do not cover these
particular methods because they are more useful with other data series. They can be used in mar-
ket analysis, and some people, such as Lou Mendleson (www.profittaker.com), claim to have
successfully been able to correlate different markets using neural network patterns. However, for
purposes of this study of optimization, we ignore neural networks, multiple regressions, and oth-
ers such as genetic algorithms, expert systems, and artificial intelligence. Instead, we focus on
the most common and productive methods, those used by the majority of systems designers.
One variation of OOS that is commonly used is to take the entire price data series to be
optimized and divide it into sections, one of 70%–80% of the data to be used to develop the sys-
tem called the “in-sample” data, and one of 20%–30% called the “out-of-sample” data. The out-
of-sample data can include the first small portion of the total period and the last, or just the last,
most recent data. As with all other test methods, the sample must include bull, bear, and consol-
idation periods. The total amount of data necessary is large in all optimization processes. This is
especially true for daily data since the beginning of the stock market rise in the early 1980s to
2000. The trend then was so strongly upward that systems designed using that data for optimiz-
ing often fell apart during the decline from 2000 to 2002. This was because the tested data did
not include many examples of declining or trading markets. All must be included so that the sys-
tem can learn to adjust to any future change in direction or habit.

==================================================

548 Part VIII System Testing and Management
This method of OOS optimizes the in-sample data and then tests it on the out-of-sample
data. The out-of-sample results are theoretically what the system should expect in real time.
Invariably, the out-of-sample performance will be considerably less than the performance gener-
ated in the optimization. If the out-of-sample results are unsatisfactory, the method can be
repeated, but the more that the out-of-sample results are used as the determinant of parameter
sets, the more that the objectivity of the optimization is compromised and the closer to curve-fit-
ting the process becomes. Eventually, if continued in this manner, the out-of-sample data
becomes the same as the sample data, and the optimization is just curve-fitting. One other
method of reducing the effect of curve-fitting is to use more than one market as the out-of-sam-
ple test. It is difficult to have the same parameter set in different markets and at the same time
curve-fit. This appears counterintuitive because most analysts would think that each market is
different, has its own personality, and requires different parameters. Indeed, when looking at
publicly available systems for sale, one method of eliminating a system from consideration is if
it has different parameters for different markets. This usually indicates that the results are from
curve-fitting, not real-time performance. A reliable system should work in most markets.
Walk Forward Optimization
ptg
Walk forward optimization is also an OOS method that uses roughly the same kind of price data
series as the one described previously. In the walk forward method, the in-sample data is also
70% to 80% of the entire series but is usually the first portion of the series, and the more recent
20% to 30% is the out-of-sample data. Although there are many variations of this method, the
most common procedure is to optimize the in-sample data and then test it on a small period of the
out-of-sample date—for example, in daily data anywhere from one month to one year. The
results of this test are recorded, and another window of data is optimized—this time, the in-sam-
ple data used earlier less the amount of time taken for the test, a month up to a year, plus the data
used in the test. Again, the results are recorded, and the window moved forward another period
until the test reaches the most recent data and a series of test recordings is available. Each opti-
mization, thus, has an out-of-sample test. The results from all the recordings are then analyzed
for consistency, profit, and risk. If some parameter set during the walk forward process suddenly
changes, the system is unlikely to work in the future. The final decision about parameter sets is
determined from the list of test results.
Optimization and Screening for Parameters
We look next at all the different summaries and ratios that a system designer considers in meas-
uring robustness (the ability of the system to adjust to changing circumstances), but first we must
mention those that are used to screen out the better systems during optimization.
When optimization is conducted on a price series, the results will show a number of differ-
ent parameter sets and a number of results from each parameter set. We can look at the net profit,
the maximum drawdown, and any of the other statistics shown in Box 22.1. Many analysts
screen for net profit, return on account, or profit factor as a beginning. They look at the average
net profit per trade to see if the system generates trades that will not be adversely affected by
transaction costs, and, most important, they look at the net profit as a percentage of the maximum
drawdown. The means of profiting from a system, any system of investing, are determined by the

Chapter 22 System Design and Testing 549
amount of risk involved. Remember the law of percentages. Risk of capital loss is the most
important determinant in profiting. The net profit percentage of maximum drawdown describes
quickly the bottom-line performance of the system. Unfortunately, the optimizing software of
some commercial systems fails to include this factor and it must be calculated from other
reported statistics.
Measuring System Results for Robustness
When analyzing a system, we look at the system components, the profit, the risk, and the
smoothness of the equity curve. We want to know how robust our results are. Robustness simply
means how strong and healthy our results are; it refers to how well our results will hold up to
changing market conditions. It is important that our system continues to perform well when the
market changes because although markets trend and patterns tend to repeat, the future market
conditions will not exactly match the past market conditions that were the basis for our system
design.
Components
ptg
The most important aspect of the optimization and testing process is to be sure that all calcula-
tions are correct. This sounds simple, but it is surprising how often this is overlooked and com-
puter program errors have led to improper calculations. The next aspect is to be sure that the
number of trades is large enough to make the results significant. The rule of thumb is between 30
and 50 trades, with 50 or more being the ideal. We have mentioned previously that the compar-
isons between in-sample and out-of-sample results should differ in performance but should not
materially differ in average duration of trades, maximum consecutive winners and losers, the
worst losing trade, and the average losing trade. We should also be aware of the average trade
result in dollars and the parameter stability. We could apply a student t test to the parameters and
their results to see if their differences are statistically significant, and we should test for brittle-
ness, the phenomenon when one or more of the rules are never triggered. Once we are satisfied
that the preceding inspection shows no material problems, we can look at the performance statis-
tics more closely.
Profit Measures
Remember that the point of practicing technical analysis is to make money—or profit. On the
surface, it seems as if this is a simple concept: If I end up with more money than I began with,
then the system is profitable. Actually, measuring and comparing the profitability of various
potential systems is not quite so straightforward. There are several ways in which analysts will
measure the profitability of systems. The major ways are as follows:
• Total profit to total loss, called the profit factor, is the most commonly used statistic
to screen for systems from optimization. It must be above 1.0, or the system is losing.
Although a high number suggests greater profits, we must be wary of overly high
numbers; generally, a profit factor greater than ten is a warning that the system has
been curve-fitted. As a measure of general performance, the profit factor only includes
profits and losses, not drawdowns. It, therefore, does not represent statistics on risk.

==================================================

550 Part VIII System Testing and Management
• Outlier-adjusted profit to loss is a profit factor that has been adjusted for the largest
profit. Sometimes a system will generate a very large profit or loss that is an anomaly.
If the profit factor is reduced by this anomaly and ends up below 1.0, the system is a
bust because it depended solely on the one large profit. The largest winning trade
should not exceed 40% to 50% of total profit.
• Percentage winning trades is a number we use in the next chapter on the makeup of
risk of ruin. Obviously, the more winning trades there are, the less chance of a run of
losses against a position. In trend-following systems, this percentage is often only 30%
to 50%. Most systems should look for a winning trade percentage greater than 60%.
Any percentage greater than 70% is suspect.
• Annualized rate of return is used for relating the results of a system against a market
benchmark.
• The payoff ratio is a calculation that is also used in the risk of ruin estimate. It is a
ratio of the average winning trade to average losing trade. For trend-following sys-
tems, it should be greater than 2.0.
ptg
• The length of the average winning trade to average losing trade should be greater
than 1. Otherwise, the system is holding losers too long and not maximizing the use of
capital. Greater than 5 is preferable for trend-following systems.
• The efficiency factor is the net profit divided by the gross profit (Sepiashvili, 2005). It
is a combination of win/loss ratio and wins probability. Successful systems usually are
in the range of 38% to 69%—the higher the better. This factor is mostly influenced by
the win percentage. It suggests that reducing the number of losing trades is more effec-
tive for overall performance than reducing the size of the losses, as through stop-loss
orders.
For a system to be robust, we should not see a sudden dip in profit measures when param-
eters are changed slightly. Stability of results is more important than total profits.
Risk Measures
What happens if you find a system that has extraordinarily high profit measures? Chances are
you have a system with a lot of risk. Remember, high profits are good, but we must balance them
against any increased risk. Some of the major ways that analysts will measure the risk within
their system are as follows:
• The maximum cumulative ddrawdown of consecutive losing trades from peak equity
can also be thought of as the largest single trade paper loss in a trade. The maximum
loss from an equity peak is the most common usage. The rule of thumb is that a maxi-
mum drawdown of two times that found in optimizing should be expected and used in
anticipated risk calculations.

Chapter 22 System Design and Testing 551
• The net profit to drawdown ratio is the same as net profit as a percentage of maxi-
mum drawdown. It is also called the recovery ratio, and it is the best method of ini-
tially screening results from optimization. In any system, it should be above 2.0.
• Maximum consecutive losses often affect the maximum drawdown. When this num-
ber is large, it suggests multiple losses in the future. It is imperative to find out what
occurred in the price history to produce this number if it is large.
• Large losses due to price shocks show how the system reacts to price shocks.
• The longgest flat time demonstrates when money is not in use. It is favorable in that it
frees capital for other purposes.
• The time to recovery from large drawdowns is a measure of how long it takes to recu-
perate losses. Ideally, this time should be short and losses recuperated quickly.
• Maximum favorable and adverse excursions from list of trades informs the system’s
designer of how much dispersion exists in trades. It can be used to measure the
smoothness of the equity curve but also give hints as to where and how often losing
trades occur. Its primary use is to give hints as to where trailing stops should be placed
ptg
to take advantage of favorable excursions and reduce adverse excursions.
• The popular Sharpe ratio has severe problems when applied to trading systems. First,
it does not include the actual annual return but only the average monthly return. Thus,
irregularities in the return are not recognized. Second, it does not distinguish between
upside and downside fluctuations. As a result, it penalizes upside fluctuations as much
as downside fluctuations. Finally, it does not distinguish between intermittent and con-
secutive losses. A system with a dangerous tendency toward high drawdowns from
consecutive losses would not be awarded as high a risk profile as others with intermit-
tent losses of little consequence.
Individual analysts will choose, and even create, the measure of risk that is most important
to their trading objectives. Some of the other measures of risk mentioned in the literature are as
follows:
• Return Retracement ratio—This is the average annualized compounded return
divided by MR (maximum of either decline from prior equity peak [i.e., worst loss
from buying at peak] or worst loss at low point from any time prior).
• Sterling ratio (over three years)—This is the arithmetic average of annual net profit
divided by average annual maximum drawdown; it is similar to the gain-to-pain ratio.
• Maximum loss—This is the worst possible loss from the highest point; using this
measure by itself is not recommended because it represents a singular event.
• Sortino ratio—This is similar to the Sharpe ratio, but considers only downside volatil-
ity. It is calculated as the ratio of the monthly expected return minus the risk-free rate
to the standard deviation of negative returns.

552 Part VIII System Testing and Management
Smoothness and the Equity Curve
Some analysts prefer to analyze risk in a graphic, visual manner. Two graphs commonly are used
as a visual analysis of a system’s performance: the equity curve and the underwater curve.
An equity curve chart is shown in Figure 22.2. It shows the level of equity profit in an
account over time. Ideally, the line of the equity profits should be straight and run from a low
level at the lower-left corner to a high level at the upper-right corner. Dips in the line are losses
either taken or created by drawdowns.
The common measure of smoothness is the standard error of equity values about the linear
regression trend drawn through those equity values. Smoothness of a system usually is affected
more by changes in the entry parameters or adjustments, such as filters. Because the majority of
price action has occurred by the exit, the exit parameters and stops have little effect on smooth-
ness.
The second type of graph used to look at system performance is the underwater curve
chart. An example of this type of chart is shown in Figure 22.3. This displays the drawdown from
each successively higher peak in equity. It is calculated in percentages and gives a representation
not only of how much drawdown occurred, but also of how much time passed until equity recov-
ered from that drawdown. As Figure 22.3 shows, the maximum percentage drawdown in the ini-
ptg
tial Nerves-of-Steel system was a little over 7%. This chart helps us to see that a major problem
with the system is not the size of the drawdowns but the time it takes for the system to recover. In
Box 22.2, we outline a method for improving the system.

BOX 22.2 UPGRADE IN THE NERVES-OF-STEEL SYSTEM
Now it is time to upgrade our system, based upon the results of our initial testing. To
show the power of stop orders, at least in this instance, we institute several kinds of
stops to limit losses. This will not necessarily reduce drawdown, however. Some-
times it will increase drawdown because while the individual losses will be smaller,
the number of losing trades will increase. To see how the results can change by intro-
ducing new factors, a two-point protective stop and a 3.4% trailing stop once the
stock had gained 0.2 percent are added.
Some tabulated data from the second test is as follows:
Trades All Long Short
Net profit $48,553 $28.944 $19,609

Look at how the system improves with the addition of the stops. The improvement is
so large that it is likely untrustworthy, especially because we have no idea as to whether
this performance will continue into the future. In reality, we would change each variable
and rule one by one to see the effect on results. Rather than go through each change indi-
vidually, we show the results after all changes, for demonstration purposes.

continued
Figure 22.4 shows the new equity curve for the system. Notice how smooth the
curve is now and how it never was in the loss column. Because stop orders increase
the number of trades that are exited and then entered again, the turnover increased
from 74 to 300 trades and were not evenly divided between short and long positions
as in a pure reversal system. This gives us plenty of sample trades. Notice also that
the percentage of profitable trades increased significantly even with the higher
turnover. The profit per trade declined, of course, but was still reasonable enough to
cover any unforeseen expenses, and the profit factor, the total profit to loss increased
substantially. There were no extraordinary winners or losers, meaning that the sys-
tem was not influenced by only one or two large trades, but the trades were only held
for a little more than a week, making the profits all short-term for tax purposes. The
largest improvement came in the return—a whopping 6,023.95% over the buy-and-
hold 154.27%. This gain came from reducing losses with the stops and shows how
the law of percentages can be fought successfully with capital risk management. The
higher turnover with less capital risk produced a higher average monthly return and ptg
a standard deviation of less than the return, well below the standard of 5.0 times.
This accounts for the smoothed equity curve.

BOX 22.3 WHAT IS A GOOD TRADING SYSTEM?
In his book, Beyond Technical Analysis, Tushar Chande discusses the characteristics
of a good trading system. Chande’s Cardinal Rules for a good trading system are the
following:
• Positive expectation—Greater than 13% annually
• Small number of robust trading rules—Less than ten each is best for entry
and exit rules
• Able to trade multiple markets—Can use baskets for determining parame-
ters, but rules should work across similar markets, different stocks, different
commodities futures, and so on
• Incorporates good risk control—Minimum risk as defined by drawdown
should not be more than 20% and should not last more than nine months
• Fully mechanical—No second-guessing during operation of the system
ptg
CONCLUSION
Throughout this book, we have looked at a number of technical indicators to guide our buying
and selling of securities in reaction to particular market conditions. In this chapter, we turned our
attention to mechanizing these reactions. A system is simply a plan or set of rules of when to buy
and sell securities. A system lets us determine a priori how we will react to particular market sit-
uations. Having a system in place helps us to follow a well-thought-out plan and prevents us
from haphazardly trading based on emotion.
Of course, our basic objective in creating a system is to make a profit. Although this sounds
like a straightforward goal, the goal of making a profit is not as simplistic as it sounds. Of course,
we test our system to see how well it performs. But—and this is an important but—just because
a system performs well using past, historical data in a trial situation does not guarantee that we
will have the same stellar results in future, real-time trading. The most basic reason for this per-
formance differential is that the market never repeats itself exactly; the system is operating in a
different market environment than the one in which it was tested. There are also some system
design and testing issues of concern. The system designer must be careful about data choice and
not to overfit the data in the sample period. As we have seen in this chapter, even a system that
has a high net profit in a test period is not necessarily a system that will perform well in the
future. The system designer must consider a host of statistics about the system performance to

determine whether the system is suitable for future trading. By following the guidelines laid out
in this chapter, you should be ready to design systems and test them to determine their appropri-
ateness for your trading situation.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Explain the difference between a discretionary and nondiscretionary system.
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a nondiscretionary system?
3. How would you describe the discipline and mind-set necessary to develop and follow a
trading or investing system?
4. Your brother is a physician who does not have the time to manage his own money. Know-
ing that you have an interest in investments and have taken a class in technical analysis, he
asks you to develop a trading system for him. Before you agree to take on this job, you
want to make sure that he understands the concept of risk. How would you explain risk to
him, especially as it is related to using a system for investing? ptg
5. After you explain the concept of risk to your brother, he still wants you to develop a trad-
ing system. In fact, he has done some reading and is convinced that a trend-following mov-
ing-average crossover system is the way to go. He even knows what stock he wants to trade
using the system—his favorite pharmaceutical company, High Profit Pharmaceuticals
(HPP). You do some initial investigation, and you think that HPP is currently in a trading
range. Explain to your brother why you think it would be unwise to attempt to trade HPP
using a moving-average crossover system at this point. (Be sure to explain the concept of a
whipsaw in your explanation.)
6. Your brother, eager to develop the “perfect” system to trade HPP, has developed a system,
tested it, and optimized it. His results show that he would have quadrupled his money last
year trading his system! He is ready to put the system in place to trade HPP this year,
expecting to quadruple his money. What questions would you have about his testing and
optimization procedures, and what warnings would you want to give him?
7. Two of your friends, Jennifer and Michael, have developed systems to trade IBM. During
the test period, Jennifer’s system had a net profit of $9,578, while Michael’s system had a
net profit of only $8,993. Explain why this information alone is not enough to determine
that Jennifer’s system is superior to Michael’s.

They [great traders] have all been humbled by the market early on in their careers.
This creates a definite respect for Mr. Market. Until one has this respect indelibly
engraved in their (sic) makeup, the concept of money management and discipline
will never be treated seriously. (Cooper, 2004)
Money management is the next and final step in portfolio design after having established a reli-
able system or systems. We have concentrated on the reward side of investment because that is
the more interesting and the part that most investors or traders find enjoyable. Unfortunately, the
reward side is only half of the portfolio equation. The other half is money management, a much-
neglected aspect of portfolio management that should receive as much attention as the reward
side. We can refer to money management as the risk side of investment, the means of preventing
financial ruin. It is principally concerned with how to measure and manage risk of loss and,
therefore, how to utilize one’s capital most efficiently. In most aspects of investing, there is a
trade-off between reward and risk. Neither can be measured precisely, and the amount of risk to

reward is a personal decision based on one’s tolerance for risk. Everyone is happy with reward,
but different investors have different thoughts on what they can accept as risk. Unfortunately,
reward is not guaranteed, but risk is. A system might not return profits, but a system will always
have losses. Just how much risk is acceptable, how to measure it, and how to control it is the sub-
ject of this chapter.
RISK AND MONEY MANAGEMENT
“Risk is the amount and probability of an adverse or series of adverse events occurring” (Rotella,
1992). Substituting “losses” for “adverse events” results in the following: Risk is the amount and
probability of a loss or series of losses occurring. Note that the probability of occurrence is as
important as the total amount.
There has never been a system that was 100% profitable, that never took a loss on any trade
or investment. Although such a system is the ideal, it has never been achieved despite the brilliant
minds, sophisticated mathematics and theories, and superfast computer abilities that have
addressed methods of investment. It likely never will be achieved. The search for such a perfect
strategy can become an obsession but is genuinely futile, and losses are, therefore, inevitable in
ptg
investing and trading.
Ruin is also very likely. Every day some traders and investors are wiped out, largely
because they did not utilize a portfolio method that included an assessment and control of risk.
The area between perfection and ruin is a compromise between the gains and losses, known more
commonly as “rewards and risks,” of a system or portfolio strategy. As can be imagined, the pos-
sibilities between perfection and ruin are limitless and have much to do with personal preference
for risk. The reward side of a strategy we can fairly well quantify, as was shown in the previous
chapter on systems, but the risk side is not so easily understood. The trade-off between the two
will affect the ultimate success or failure of a portfolio strategy. That is the essence of money
management—to maximize return at minimum risk. No home runs, no Holy Grails, no perpetual
money machines—just plain and simple, consistent profits with minimum chance of losing all of
one’s capital. The extremes, of course, range between highly leveraged options or futures con-
tracts in a seat-of-the-pants, untested, untried system, and on the opposite side, strictly cash. The
cash investment theoretically has no risk, whereas hotshot investments and systems are likely
doomed. (A cash position does not have the risk of losing capital. Economists, however, will
consider the inflation risk—the risk of the cash position losing purchasing power during infla-
tionary periods.)
Ironically, a good system can lose money if it is not applied with concern for risk. Money
management can turn it into a profitable, reliable system, but money management cannot help a
system that does not work. Thus, as we covered in the last chapter, the first step in creating a
portfolio strategy is to find a workable system, preferably more than one. It need not be a super-
system, just one that consistently shows higher profits than losses. It can be based on fundamen-
tals, technicals, or both. If you read interviews with successful traders and investors, you will
find every one of them has a different method or system of entering the markets, but they all have
in common a money-management system to protect against loss. Indeed, most will admit that

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 561
money management is more important than any system. The second step is to decide on what
markets and in which issues the system will trade or invest. The third step is to combine these
systems and issues into a portfolio strategy. At this point, the subject of money management
arises.
Because the theories of money management largely concern price and size, the evaluation
and control of risk are technical. Fundamental investors cannot assess risk in the marketplace
with fundamentals alone. What should be the initial capital? What should be the trade size in
contracts, shares, or dollars? What should be the risk strategies applied to these positions? What
should be the execution style? Should the strategies be combined into one portfolio system, or
should each system be treated separately? All these questions must be answered to manage the
portfolio successfully, and all of them rely on technical studies and use of price action and sig-
nals. Generally, the systems will take care of themselves if properly tested and will give adequate
entry signals, leaving the investor with the problem of how to best position from those signals
and what exit strategies to use. The object of money management is to maximize the best situa-
tions and avoid or minimize those situations that can cause capital loss.
Because money management has much to do with determining the size of positions, it has
also been called “position sizing.” However, there is more to it than just sizing. The parameters
for risk avoidance, such as stops and exit strategies, are also important, as are diversification and
execution methods. We cover some of the principal money-management strategies you should ptg
know and demonstrate methods of testing for and reducing the risk of ruin.
TESTING MONEY-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
We covered the standard method of testing a system in Chapter 22, “System Design and Testing,”
but now we are looking at complete portfolio systems that include, hopefully, many subsystems
and many issues traded using each subsystem with different objectives that satisfy the require-
ment for diversification. Of course, we should already have tested each subsystem by itself with
a diversified number of issues and have confidence in its results alone. By merging it into a port-
folio system, however, we now need a method to test the entire model. We will see that the model
often will produce better results than any of the separate subsystems do individually. To test the
model, we can use the same methodology as used in Chapter 22, or we can use what is called a
Monte Carlo simulation.
Because the testing system in Chapter 22 is plagued with the risk of curve-fitting and the
inability to determine the success or failure of the system under varying circumstances, we need
a testing method that looks at a multiple set of possibilities and tells us how well the rule, vari-
ables, and parameters in the combined subsystems handle change. The Monte Carlo simulation
is one of the better and more often used testing methods of portfolio risk.
Without discussing the mathematics behind a simulation (because it can become very com-
plicated), we instead just outline what it does. A simple simulation can be performed on a spread-
sheet, with considerable work, and a more sophisticated software program called Equity Monaco
is available from www.tickquest.com for free. More sophisticated software is available else-
where for a fee. More information on the mathematics of Monte Carlo simulations can be seen at
www.montecarlosimulations.org.

562 Part VIII System Testing and Management
As we will see later in this chapter, with the martingale betting system, a system may be
profitable but the bettor must be able to withstand a long series of losses (a large drawdown).
This means that the trading system results, even if spectacular from the optimization tests, could
be just the result of chance or luck.
In the martingale betting system, the system is profitable only as long as the bettor is able
to withstand a long series of losses, a large drawdown. To measure whether the system is valu-
able in all circumstances and what the odds of failure from a series of losses might be, especially
because the trader usually has limited capital, the trader (or investor) needs to test for as many
different circumstances as possible. The Monte Carlo simulation does not use the rule, variables,
or parameters in the original trading system. It uses only the actual trades, entry and exit, and the
profit or loss from each. It looks at the sequence of these trades from various angles to see what
the probability of a series of losses leading to ruin exists in the system. It, thus, is a money-man-
agement test rather than a system test, though obviously the system determines the trades. If the
money-management test fails by showing a high probability of ruin, the original system must be
discarded, adjusted to improve these results, or other safeguards installed to prevent such a pos-
sible disaster.
The simulation takes the original trade data, profits, and losses and scrambles them in a
random manner. This is done many times, usually at least 100 times and better if 1,000 or 2,000
times. An equity curve is then created for each scrambled sequence of trades. The results from ptg
each equity curve are then assembled to give the results and related to a normal distribution
curve. The simulation is testing to see if the system is random and by how much. The less the
system is random, the more likely it will be profitable with minimum risk of failure.
MONEY-MANAGEMENT RISKS
We have defined risk in many ways in earlier chapters. Variability of returns, amount of loss per
trade, beta, maximum amount of loss per trade, drawdown, maximum drawdown, and volatility
of prices have all been used. In Appendix A, “Basic Statistics,” we cover some of the statistical
principles associated with risk measurement in Modern Portfolio Theory. One of the principal
difficulties in the use of standard linear statistics in evaluating markets is that it assumes that each
price, each trade, and each profit or loss is independent. In other words, it stands by itself and is
not related to any other price, trade, or trade return. When using such statistics, one must, there-
fore, be careful not to believe absolutely in what the statistical tests might show.
Concepts
For our purposes, the important risk consideration is loss of capital. This comes from losses on
trades, realized or unrealized, and, thus, we will use drawdowns as the best definition of risk.
Because drawdowns, if not controlled, can lead to ruin, our intention in this chapter is to develop
means that will keep us from losing all our capital.

==================================================

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 563
Drawdown and Maximum Drawdown
When we discussed drawdowns in the previous chapter, we found that more than one drawdown
can occur, and it may result from one trade or many trades. If we look at all the drawdowns over
a period, the one that has the highest intrapeak equity percentage loss is called the maximum
drawdown (MDD). The MDD is the worst case that occurred in the system and often is used as
an estimate of the worst case that can occur in the future. Of course, it could have been a fluke
and exaggerate potential drawdowns in real trading, or it could underestimate and make draw-
downs appear less damaging than they would be in real trading. We will find that we can reduce
risk of loss on single trades with stops, but we cannot reduce the risk from a series of losses. All
we can do is find a realistic estimate of the odds of a long run of losses against us and then take
our chances or change the system. Even assuming a large MDD, we must design the money-
management strategy such that enough capital is always available to withstand a loss in the mag-
nitude of the known MDD. Otherwise, the system goes broke.
Drawdowns, for statistical purposes, are not independent, especially if the loss occurs in
multiple systems at one time based on some adverse news. Uncontrollable loss, called “an act of
God” in the insurance industry, or a “Black Swan” after the subject of the book by that name by
Nassim Taleb (2010), cannot be anticipated and thus is never included in any estimate of risk.
These events, however, usually only affect a single trade rather than a series of trades.
ptg
Theory of Runs
A drawdown is usually the result of a series of losses. We can estimate the chances of a series of
losses using the theory of runs. This theory states that the probability of a series of independent
events is the product of the probability of each event occurring. Thus, if a system has a losing
percentage of 40%, the odds of a run of five losses in a row are (0.40 ×0.40 ×0.40 ×0.40 ×0.40)
= .01 or 1%. If a system has a losing percentage of 60%, the odds of a run of five losses in a row
are 8%. Although this calculation does not account for money lost in each transaction, it does
suggest that to avoid a series of losses, the lower the losing percentage of the system, the better.
Even so, a large number of losses together may not be harmful to a system specifically—many
trend-following systems have long runs of losses—but create an additional risk of loss of confi-
dence in the system and the potential premature abandonment just before it becomes profitable.
Psychology is a major component in trading, and confidence is usually fragile when trades are
going against the trader.
Martingale Betting System
A martingale betting system often is used in a situation where the bet size can be changed but the
odds are relatively even, such as gambling at a roulette wheel. The basis for the method is the
theory of runs and the odds against a long series of losses when probability is about even. The
method is to double up on the next bet after a loss, and return to the standard bet after a win.
Eventually, a winning bet will cover all the previous losses and return a profit on the original bet.
Unfortunately, the system requires substantial capital to withstand an unexpectedly long series of
losses in a row.
For example, assume you make a $100 standard bet that takes the $100 bet and either
returns the bet plus $100 on a win or pays nothing on a loss with even odds of winning or losing

(50% win percentage). After a run of five successive losses occurs, using a martingale system,
the next bet will require $3,200 above the $3,100 that has already been lost ($100 + $200 + $400
+ $800 + $1,600 = $3,100). Thus, to bet the sixth time after five successive losses would require
$6,300, hoping for a win that would net $100 above our previous commitment. It is a tough way
to make $100. Nevertheless, as long as the bettor can ante up the funds for the next bet in a los-
ing series of bets, he or she will profit eventually by the amount of the original bet ($100) when
the final winning bet occurs.
If the payoff ratio is greater than one-for-one and the win percentage is greater than 50%,
the martingale approach may be profitable in the trading markets, but that long series of losses is
always hanging out in space somewhere waiting to occur. Furthermore, in the trading markets,
the profit from each bet is not constant. It could, for example, be larger for losses than for gains.
Of course, a maximum loss or stop can be used to get out of the game, but by then so much cap-
ital has been lost that the chances of recovery are slim. Needless to say, the martingale approach
rarely is used in trading markets.
Reward to Risk
The objective in all investment is to have a high reward to risk. Return on investment, or ROI, is
the standard calculation of reward. ROI is calculated as net profit divided by initial capital at the ptg
beginning of the measured period. We have gone into more detail in Appendix A on statistics.
The standard method for analyzing portfolios and systems for reward and risk is to calcu-
late the ratio of ROI to the MDD. This is called the Sterling ratio and is how we initially evalu-
ated the system design parameters in Chapter 22. Some analysts use other ratios. The profit/loss
ratio, also called the profit factor, is commonly used, and the payoff ratio, which is the average
gain per profitable trade to the average loss per unprofitable trade, is often used. Other methods
of measuring specific aspects of a system or portfolio reward-to-risk are the Sharpe ratio, men-
tioned in Chapter 22 and Appendix A, and percent of winning trades.
A recent myth about MDD, derived from the risk-reward relationship in Modern Portfolio
Theory, is that a higher MDD suggests a higher return. This is not true. Capital risk and reward
are not proportional. MDD cannot be greater than 100%, but return can theoretically be infinite.
Normal Risks
The most important aspect of money management, beyond establishing where and what kind of
stops to use to protect capital, is the determination of position size for each trade. Too much in a
position can incur unwarranted risks in case of failure, including complete ruin, and too little can
reduce profit potential beyond the risk-free rate. Position size is directly related to capital risk,
the amount of money that can be lost, and it is the aspect of money management that most traders
and investors overlook.
Position Size
By “position size,” we mean the amount of capital committed to a system or investment that incurs
a specific risk. This is usually based on the difference between the entry price and exit price mul-
tiplied by the number of shares or contracts. As an example, let us assume we can only risk $500
in a trade. We have a breakout system that will buy a stock at $50. We place a protective sell stop

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 565
at $45. This $5 difference in price is the capital risk we are taking per share. The entire position is
not at risk because it will be liquidated on the stop. Without a stop, of course, we have no idea
what risk we are taking. This is one reason fundamental analysis has trouble controlling capital
risk. It has no means of determining when to exit a position. Knowing we have a $5 dollar per
share risk, however, we know we can buy 100 shares for a total capital risk of our limit of $500.
In systems, position size has two levels of importance. The first is the determination of the
minimum size of account required to trade a system with a minimum level of potential risk of
ruin. The second is the determination of the optimal size of each position taken in a system that
meets the predetermined risk level of the system owner. Generally, the position size in either
determination is based on the maximum drawdown of the system and the margin required for a
futures contract or price of a stock.
Number of Shares or Contracts
In the stock market, the question of how many shares to use in a system is relatively easy because
margin requirements are comparatively small and the number of shares flexible. In the futures
markets, however, the number of contracts to use can become a problem. Margin requirements
frequently change. The two standard methods of determining the number of contracts are either
to use the system on a fixed number of contracts or to determine the risk as a percentage of the
ptg
trading account and divide that by the margin required for each contract. After a successful series
of trades, if the account capital has increased, a decision must be made as to whether to continue
with a set number of contracts or continue with the percentage risk proportion on a continuous
capital adjustment. Some traders use a capital step process whereby the number of contracts is
only adjusted when the account capital reaches certain thresholds.
Evstigneev and Schenk-Hoppe (2001) argue that constant proportion strategies produce
wealth more rapidly than other proportional methods. This is an outgrowth of the Kelly formula
discussed next and implies that keeping a portfolio equally proportionally invested is the best
method of accumulating profits. This concept goes against the grain of some analysts. They
maintain that while the system is working, the accumulation of profits is favorable, but at some
time, a significant series of losses will occur, when the capital is larger than its initial size, and
the losses will be proportionately larger because they depend on the proportion of the capital in
the account. For now, we will go with the statistical evidence from Evstigneev and Schenk-
Hoppe. They are not alone in their conclusions. As such, we will look for the optimal proportion
of capital to invest in a system that will avoid the risk of total loss of capital. This sometimes is
referred to as the “fixed fractional” method.
Determining Optimal Position Size
There are three methods of determining the position size: (1) Risk of Ruin formula, (2) Theory of
Runs formula, and (3) Optimal f or Kelly formula. To calculate the best position size, all three
formulas should be used, and that formula with the smallest percentage of capital to be risked
should be the one used in the system or model.
Risk of Ruin Formula
The Risk of Ruin (ROR) formula uses three pieces of data from the historical or testing data: (1)
the probability of success or the percentage of wins; (2) the payoff ratio, or average win trade
amount divided by the average loss trade amount; and (3) the fraction exposed to trading.

==================================================

566 Part VIII System Testing and Management
The risk of ruin formula (Kaufman, 1998) is
cu
ROR = ((1–ta)÷(1+ta))
Where: ROR is the risk of ruin
ta is the trading advantage (percent wins minus percent losses)
cu is the number of trading units, shares, or contracts
Because the ratio is always less than one, the greater “cu” is, the less chance of ruin using
a fixed dollar amount. In addition, the greater the “ta,” the less chance of ruin. The risk of ruin,
therefore, is proportional to the percentage wins. The formula demonstrates that trend-following
systems with a high percentage of losses often should end in ruin. This formula, however, fails to
account for the amount of each win and loss.
To determine the optimal percentage of capital to use in any system with win and loss
amounts, use this formula:
PCT = ([(A + 1) ×p] – 1) / A
Where: PCT is the percentage of capital to use
ptg
A is the average payoff ratio
p is the percentage of wins
BOX 23.1 OPTIMAL PERCENTAGE OF CAPITAL TO AVOID RISK OF RUIN
Using the figures from the example in Chapter 22, let us calculate the percentage of
capital to use from the risk of ruin formula.
Data
(p) Percent profitable trades (profitable trades) = 82.33%
Average win trade amount = $231.85
Average loss trade amount = $170.84
(A) Average payoff ratio (average win/average loss) = 1.357
Formula
Optimal percentage of capital = {[(A + 1) ×p] – 1}÷A
Substituting
Optimal percentage of capital = {[(1.357 + 1) ×.8233] – 1}÷1.357 = 69.3%
That is, any amount over 69.3% of capital in this system has a high chance of ending in ruin. The
high percentage suggests that the risk of ruin is low for normal commitments of 2%.

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 567
Theory of Runs
The chance of going broke from a series of losses is the amount of trading times the percentage
of losses to the power of the largest string of losses. Most analysts will assume a minimum run of
ten consecutive losses as the baseline. In any case, most calculations end with a maximum sug-
gested percentage investment of around 2% to avoid the risk of going broke.
Optimal f and the Kelly Formula
The Kelly formula was invented by John L. Kelly, Jr. of Bell Labs in the early 1940s to measure
long-distance telephone noise and was later adopted by gamblers to determine optimal betting
sizes. Its application to the trading markets is somewhat tenuous because it does not account for
MDD and, thus, risk of ruin. However, it is used in conjunction with other position-size calcula-
tions to determine the optimal size of a position relative to capital. In any profitable system, cap-
ital growth increases in proportion to the percentage of capital risked. After a certain threshold in
the percentage, however, the rate of growth decreases and eventually reaches zero. The Kelly
ratio or optimal f is the threshold of maximum growth. Optimal f is, therefore, a method of deter-
mining the optimal percentage of capital that should be invested in a particular system.
The optimal f percentage = (percentage of wins ×(profit factor + 1) – 1) / profit factor ptg
Where: Percentage of wins is the percentage of winning trades
Profit factor is the ratio of total gains over total losses
Once f is determined, it is multiplied times capital for the amount to be used in each posi-
tion. This amount can be divided by the contract margin requirement for each contract to deter-
mine the number of contracts. In the stock market, the amount for each position can be divided
by the price of the shares to determine the number of shares. Because this method often suffers
from extraordinary drawdowns, the percentage of capital is usually limited to 0.8 of optimal f, or
a maximum optimal f of 25%.
To account for MDD that is otherwise not in the f formula, another method called the
secure f (Zamansky and Stedhahl, 1998) is to divide the MDD by optimal f to determine the
amount that can be risked on one contract or convert this amount to a percentage of capital for
stock shares. The Larry Williams formula for the number of contracts to trade is to take the
amount of money at risk (account balance times risk percent from whatever formula) divided by
the largest single loss. A loss in the future can be controlled by stops.

BOX 23.2 CALCULATING OPTIMAL F
Again, using the system developed in Chapter 22, let us calculate the optimal f.
Formula
Optimal f = (percentage of wins ×(profit factor + 1) –1) / profit factor
Data
Percentage of wins = 82.33%
Profit factor = 5.81
Substituting
Optimal f = (.8233 ×(5.81 + 1) –1) / 5.81
= 79.2%
This is the maximum percentage to invest any capital account in the Nerves-of-Steel
system developed in Chapter 22.
ptg
Final Position Size
The smallest percentage of capital suggested by the three formulas is used as the final percentage
to use in trading the specified system. Generally, because the theory of runs limits the percentage
to around 2%, most professional traders use this figure, or less, as a maximum commitment to
any system. In the Nerves-of-Steel system, however, the percentage of losses is so small, the
odds of a run of five losses is almost negligible. Thus, the other methods should take precedence,
and each shows that a substantial portion of assets could have been invested in the system.
Initial Capital
The reason for concern about initial capital requirements is the risk of a series of losses right in
the beginning of the system use. The problem at start-up is not the problem of individual loss in
a trade. That can be controlled with stops. The problem is the risk of complete loss of capital.
This problem is related to the possibility of a run of losses that wipes out capital and eliminates
the trader from being able to reenter the system. Later, when profits have accrued, the accumu-
lated profit cushion lessens the risk of losing all, but at the start, the risk of being wiped out is the
highest.
A general rule of thumb for initial capital is to have at least three times the margin required
for a single contract for each contract traded, or at least two times the amount of the MDD plus
the initial margin for stocks and contracts. A more precise number can be determined from the
Monte Carlo simulation described previously, estimating the odds of complete failure of the sys-
tem using history. As in any simulation, the levels determined from the test should be doubled or
tripled as a precaution against extraordinary initial surprises.

BOX 23.3 INITIAL CAPITAL—MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
In Chapter 22, we developed the Nerves-of-Steel trading system. Now, using a
Monte Carlo simulation of the Nerves-of-Steel system, let us look at a chart of the
distribution of terminal equity for the total number of tests. The test period was nine
years, seven months, and five days, and 300 positions were taken for an average of
46 per year. The initial price of U.S. Steel was $17.45, and we assume all trades are
100 shares. From our earlier calculations of maximum capital to risk on this system,
the lowest was 69%. Taking the first position of 100 shares at $17.45 and dividing by
69% gives us $2,500, the amount of ideal starting capital based on those calcula-
tions. We set the maintenance capital at $1,000. This is the level below which our
system goes broke. (We need the remaining $1,000 to close up shop and go home.)
We then run the simulation to see if the system can withstand a series of adverse runs
within a year.
The lower line in Figure 23.1 shows the results for an initial capital of $2,500. At
the 50% vertical line, the upper line appears at $9,700. This means that 50% of the
upper tests beginning with $2,500 had ending equity of $9,700 or less. At no time in
the 2,000 simulations did the Nerves-of-Steel go broke within the first year. ptg

570 Part VIII System Testing and Management
Leverage
Leverage, or the borrowing of capital to increase the potential for gain, of course, also increases
the risk. Leverage generally increases the volatility of the portfolio or system and, thus, magni-
fies all those dangerous possibilities from increased volatility, including larger drawdowns and
more potential for complete failure.
Risk is proportional to leverage. If we find that our system or combination of systems pro-
duces an MDD that is unacceptably high, we can adjust the portfolio mix to include a risk-free
investment, such as Treasury bills, in the proportion necessary to bring down the potential MDD.
For example, if the model estimates a 40% MDD, and we will only accept a 20% MDD, we can
adjust the model to invest 50% of the capital in risk-free investments and the remainder in the
systems. On the other hand, if the systems suggest a 10% MDD, and we are willing to accept a
20% MDD, we can borrow 100% of the model’s capital and double our return as well as our risk.
Pyramiding
Pyramiding is a more complicated method of adding leverage to a position. It consists of adding
to a profitable position to gain leverage. Of course, the risks are not as clear because gaining size
in the position after it is profitable may result in a larger position just as the inevitable drawdown
begins. The best manner of pyramiding is to test it within the system as a set of rules. Specific ptg
rules of thumb for pyramiding include the following:
1. Never adding to a position until its profit becomes positive
2. Placing stops at the break-even level as size increases
3. Entering the largest positions first and diminishing the size of subsequent entries
4. Being sure that the position risk is still within the limits established by the system and by
the maximum acceptable position size
Unusual Risks
Before we become involved in standard portfolio risks, we must be aware of other risks that we
have some control over but that will not usually show up in standard tests of performance. These
are outlined next.
Psychological Risk
As we have mentioned many times earlier, trading and investing are largely psychological. The
motion of investment vehicles is due largely to rational and to irrational decisions on the part of
buyers and sellers. Taking advantage of this price motion through technical analysis is an emo-
tional exercise for the trader or investor as well. The participant in the markets must be careful
not to be swept up in the emotion of the crowd; indeed, in many instances, he or she must act
against the crowd and, thus, against human nature. Many inputs can affect the psychological sta-
bility of the trader. Lack of sleep, family fight, sickness, or any other nonstandard outside inter-
vention can upset one’s attitude and ability to act successfully. Unfortunately, once lack of

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 571
success begins, lack of confidence also begins, and lack of confidence can cause even more
errors in judgment. The purpose in designing a nondiscretionary system is to reduce those out-
side emotional effects and let the system operate by itself. However, a losing system or series of
losses can cause even the slightest override of the system; simply a change in orders, a wait after
a breakout, or any other minor action unknowingly can upset the expected results even more.
Many system overrides are not even recognized by the trader—just a little change here and there.
Thus, there is a constant battle between the psyche and the markets. A supersystem will not avoid
one’s own nature. Only oneself can control one’s nature. It is a risk that cannot be eliminated by
a computer, only reduced, and the system must be followed religiously. Some writers argue that
the psychology of trading accounts for better than 70% of success. This is likely true, but unfor-
tunately, it is perverse and unquantifiable.
Knowledge of the Market
“I didn’t realize that option expired today” or “I didn’t realize that contract traded at night in Sin-
gapore” can be costly mistakes. The trader or investor must be fully aware of the markets being
traded, their history, their method of execution, their various peculiarities, their people, their
structure, and their operation. There is no excuse for losing money from simple ignorance. Most
investors learn from experience about the oddities of particular markets, but that experience can
ptg
be costly.
Diversifiable Risk
Diversification is a complex subject. As we saw in Chapter 22, the complexity has to do with the
weighting amount of different vehicles or systems in a portfolio, as well as whether the behaviors
of the components are similar or different from each other. Various mathematical models have
been developed; but as we said before, diversification is the commonsense approach of “not put-
ting all your eggs in one basket” that is needed. Obviously, if different vehicles or systems are
used, they should not act in concert. Otherwise, they are essentially the same system, and risk has
not been diversified away.
Risk is both correlated and uncorrelated. Correlated risk cannot be eliminated through
diversification. We must use other means. This nondiversifiable, or market, risk is the risk gener-
ated by the overall market itself and accounts for a large portion of portfolio risk. Uncorrelated
risk, however, can be reduced through diversification. Uncorrelated risk comes from the effects
of all sorts of exogenous variables on individual issues and has more to do with the risk of the
individual issue than the overall market. Uncorrelated risk can be reduced by diversification into
dissimilar or uncorrelated issues or systems.
An example of correlated, nondiversifiable risk would be the risk that the Federal Reserve
tightening the money supply will have a widespread impact on security values and impact almost
any stock in a portfolio. On the other hand, the risk that a Vioxx lawsuit will decrease the value
of Merck stock is uncorrelated, diversifiable risk. The lawsuit would not impact the stocks of
other companies.
Reduction in uncorrelated risk can reduce MDD and enhance ROI. Indeed, the results of a
diversified portfolio are often superior to the results from the best individual system by itself.
The Capital Asset Pricing Model suggests that a properly structured 9-stock portfolio reduces the

572 Part VIII System Testing and Management
uncorrelated risk to that of one-third the risk of a single stock. A 16-stock portfolio can reduce
uncorrelated risk to one-fourth that of a single stock. The relationship is based on the inverse
square root of the number of stocks in the portfolio. As such, the portfolio can never eliminate
uncorrelated risk, but with just a few different issues or systems, it can reduce it enough to make
it irrelevant. The real problem then becomes the effect of correlated risk as in the debt crisis in
2008–2009 when many investments that had earlier been uncorrelated suddenly became corre-
lated and declined together. What constitutes correlation in investments or systems, then, is a
subject equally difficult to assess. Some investors believe that diversification detracts from per-
formance because it dilutes reward along with risk. Using specific selection methods to concen-
trate on the investments with the most potential, they use exit strategies in individual issues to
reduce uncorrelated risk and market timing for the entire portfolio to reduce correlated risk. (For
more details on the mathematics behind diversification and portfolio theory, refer to Appendix
A.)
One further complication in the subject of correlations is that often a lead-lag relationship
occurs that is invisible to the system tester, and most correlations themselves change over time.
Efficient diversification is, thus, a useful and important subject but not a simple one.
Trade Frequency
ptg
Ten losing trades in different markets is the same as ten consecutive losses in one market. The
drawdown is the same. Thus, diversification can bring problems as well as reduce risk. The fre-
quency of trading in different markets will increase the risk of a series of losses across markets.
Temporal
Risk increases with time. The longer a position is held, the more risky it becomes. This is why
long-term interest rates are usually higher than short-term rates. On the other hand, in the mar-
kets, reward does not increase with time. Thus, to reduce risk, a position should not be held
beyond the time that reward ends. Then, only risk remains.
Security Quality
If given the choice of trading a high-quality issue (as determined by some financial rating serv-
ice) that has the same market characteristics as a low-quality issue, including volatility, liquidity,
and volume, which would you choose? The high-quality issue, of course. Erroneously, quality is
a concept that normally is not addressed and certainly is not a factor in most systems models.
MONEY-MANAGEMENT RISK STRATEGIES
In addition to determining the optimal position size, optimal initial capital, and leverage, risk
strategies include the timing and placement of exits.
Entry strategies carry no risk until executed. An entry can be made at any time, when the
situation or setup is right, or not at all. Perhaps you would rather go to the beach. Because you
must now watch your investment, you cannot go to the beach. Once entered into a position, how-
ever, an exit strategy is necessary because the position is now at risk. It is the most important
action decision in any system.

==================================================

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 573
Exit strategies are usually twofold: prevention of loss of capital or closing at a target profit
or price. Prevention of capital loss can come after a loss, as in a protective stop, or after a profit,
as in a trailing stop. There is always a trade-off between potential reward and potential risk. An
exit stop placed too tightly to the trading price prevents a single large loss, but many small losses
that are equally devastating can occur instead. An exit stop can also be too loose, resulting in a
larger-than-necessary loss. It must be wide enough to avoid being triggered by random noise and
intrinsic volatility of the issue but not sacrifice too many profitable trades. At other times, a profit
may have accrued, and rather than a risk of loss, the question of stop placement or target exit is
necessary. All these decisions, naturally, should be tested before the situation arises. There are
advantages and disadvantages to all of them.
Slippage is a problem with stops. Any stop that suggests an exit in the direction of the
short-term trend rarely will be executed at the same price as the system test suggests. A volatility
stop, for example, often will occur when price volatility exceeds the estimated volatility, and a
technical stop at a specific price, depending on where it is located within a price pattern, may
occur along with many others and receive a poor execution. A target exit often receives a better
execution and less slippage because the trend is directed into the target limit. However, it might
not be executed at all if the price fails to reach the target, or the price might roar through the tar-
get and lose profit opportunity. There is no easy answer about slippage except that these potential
problems should be addressed in the testing of a system. ptg
Protective Stop
All entries must have a protective stop under all circumstances, and that stop must be inviolate.
The protective stop is placed at the level of maximum limit of loss from entry, accounting for the
maximum loss that the trader can allow on any one position on any one trade. It is often called a
“money-management” stop because it prevents the complete loss of capital. It is determined by
the level of risk that the trader is willing to take with his capital in any one position on any one
trade. There are numerous methods of determining where the protective stop should be placed.
Hard Money or Dollar Stop
When we decide how much money we are willing to risk in a trade, we can place a protective
money stop at a price level that reflects that potential loss and no more. In the earlier example of
position size risk, we considered a stock trading at $50 and the maximum amount we wanted to
risk was $500. We can buy 100 shares at $50 and place a sell stop at $45, or we can buy 200
shares at $50 and place a sell stop at $47.50. The same dollar risk appears to be present in each
transaction. This is not accurate, however, because the odds of being triggered at $47.50 are
higher than at $45. The consideration of where to place the stop, therefore, should be one based
on the best price rather than on how many shares can be bought. Once the price is determined,
the amount of shares to purchase can be adjusted accordingly. Let us say there is a large support
level at $46. It would be wiser to use the $45 stop than the $47.50 stop, even though fewer shares
are originally purchased, because the support level has a better chance of holding the stock from
falling through $45 and triggering the stop. Furthermore, as technical traders, we know that if the
support level at $46 is broken, we do not want to own the stock. At $47.50, we do not know any-
thing about the stock prospects, and the market does not care.

==================================================

574 Part VIII System Testing and Management
Maximum Winning Adverse Excursion
The protective stop is placed to prevent loss if something goes wrong with the system. A method
of determining when the system is going wrong is called the maximum adverse excursion
method. Taking each winning trade in the system test or from the past real-time use of the sys-
tem, one plots the frequency of adverse excursions. These are the amounts by which the value of
the entered position in each trade goes against the initial value before it is closed at a profit. It is
similar to a drawdown except limited to winning trades. If an entry is made and the trade eventu-
ally is a profitable one, the adverse excursion is the amount of money that the trade was in the
hole before it turned profitable. Some profitable trades immediately profit. These are not a prob-
lem. Looking at those winning trades that do have initial problems, you will find that over time,
the excursion from entry value reaches a limit. If the system is trouble free, that price is the level
beyond which a profitable trade should not go in the future. A price just beyond that level is
where the protective stop should be placed. Losing trade adverse excursions are not considered
because they will become a problem and will be stopped out at the protective stop. Once the
maximum adverse excursion from winning trades is established, it also determines how many
contracts or shares can be entered on the system entry signal. If the maximum adverse excursion
for one contract is greater than the maximum limit of loss allowed by the trader, the position
should not be taken. Otherwise, the number of shares or contracts can be determined by dividing
the maximum adverse excursion by the margin required for the contract or the price of the ptg
shares. The maximum winning adverse excursion should be recalculated periodically to maintain
consistent with any changes in the market or the system.
Trailing Stop
With the protective stop in place and inviolate, the market issue will either trigger that stop or
will begin to profit. Once a certain amount of profit in the trade has occurred, the next problem
for the system is to maximize the profit without giving up too much of what has been gained. A
trailing stop is used most frequently to lock in the gain.
Breakeven Level and Breakeven Stop
A trailing stop often is not placed until a certain gain level is accumulated. This is called the
breakeven level, the profit level at which a stop can be placed at the entry price to lock in a
breakeven on the trade but not be triggered by noise. In the preceding example, we bought the
stock at $50, and after a little erratic motion, the stock rose to $55. The ATR (Average True
Range) is $1.50. If we had earlier set three times the ATR, or $4.50, as the break-even level, then
when the stock reached $54.50 ($50 + $4.50), we would automatically raise the protective stop
to a break-even stop at the entry price of $50. This eliminates the risk of any loss on the transac-
tion from now on. At the same time as the break-even stop is placed, a trailing stop strategy is ini-
tiated.
Another method of handling the break-even level is to exit half the position when the profit
has reached the break-even level. The break-even stop is then raised to the entry price. This
method locks in a profit, keeps a portion of the position open, and cannot lose capital once it is
entered. The potential for profit is reduced, but a smaller profit has already been stashed, and the
risk of loss is zero on the remaining portion. A trailing stop strategy then is applied to the remain-
ing position.

==================================================

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 575
Technical Point Versus Money Point
The decision about a trailing stop usually centers on whether to use a technical point or a money
point. A money point stop is similar to a hard money stop described previously, only in this case
it defines the amount that the trade should not lose from its maximum profit level. If $500 is the
money point stop, the stop-price level changes with the value change in the market issue, such
that if a correction of more than $500 occurs from the maximum unrealized profit, the system
will exit the trade. A technical stop is one that is placed at a price that represents a technical level
beyond which it is obvious that the trade is reversing direction. It is sometimes called a critical
threshold stop (Katz and McCormick, 1998) because breaking the specified stop level is critical
to the trade. Technical points often are used more in investment and swing trading trailing stops.
Money point stops are used more in short-term trading, where price action is often more erratic.
The market itself does not accommodate a money point stop because that level is unrelated to the
market price and is a matter of the personal risk decision of the trader, but the market does
respect the technical stop if properly placed.
Volatility Stop
We discussed volatility stops in Chapter 13, “Breakouts, Stops, and Retracements.” A trailing
stop is placed at a certain level based on the historical volatility of the issue. As such, the stop
price will adjust to changes in volatility, and loosen when volatility increases and tighten when ptg
volatility decreases. It is commonly used for this reason.
Maximum Winning Favorable
A maximum winning favorable excursion, as opposed to the adverse used in establishing stops,
also can be used to establish a trailing stop. The maximum favorable excursion is the highest
amount that a profitable trade reaches before it is exited. It is similar to a target. A fraction of this
calculation is added to the entry price, and the fraction is increased over time.
Trend Line
A trend line stop can be used because a trend line follows the price action. As a technical point
stop, it has advantages in that a bunching of orders at a critical level, such as a support or resist-
ance zone, usually is not seen along a trend line, such that when triggered, the execution of the
exit will be less influenced by competing orders.
Adaptive
Special formulas, such as Wilder’s parabolic, can be used. These formulas follow the price trend
and adjust to market conditions along the way. They and volatility stops also are called adaptive
stops, and their details can be complicated.
Other Kinds of Stops
We have just considered a number of protective and trailing stop strategies, which are generally
based on price action. Other exit strategies may be employed, such as those based on a particular
technical signal or those based on time.

576 Part VIII System Testing and Management
Signal
One obvious stop is the signal stop. This occurs when the system gives a signal to enter a posi-
tion in the opposite direction from the existing position. It is part of a stop-and-reverse system.
Time
Because of the multidimensional aspect of time and reward versus risk, a time stop often is used
in short-term trading when time, cost of money, and opportunity cost are important. This stop is
placed to exit the position a certain time after the entry. If a profit has not been gained within the
time specified, the odds of it not occurring in the future increase and the position is best closed to
avoid further risk. A variation of the time stop is to reduce the position size as certain time
passes. This reduces the risk but leaves room for some further gain. Time stops are also used in
swing trading where the trade horizon is only a few days.
Targets
In our look at point-and-figure charts and, in some instances, at bar chart patterns, a price target
often is established. Exiting at a target can be an exit strategy. In short-term trading, money tar-
gets are often used: “If I make $500 on this trade, I’m out.” Targets can be tested as long as the
target calculation method is easily quantified. At a target, especially a longer-term target, posi-
tion size may be reduced or trailing stops tightened using technical barriers, a money stop, or ptg
volatility adjustment. In addition, once a target is reached, the system might have a reentry signal
that enters the position again if the target is exceeded by a certain amount or the trend continues.
Finally, a combination of target and time stop can adjust the target prices as time moves along.
This reduces the possibility of the added risk with time affecting profits. All target limits should
be accompanied by a trailing stop to avoid losing any profits already gained in case a target is not
reached.
Execution
Execution risk strategies are useful in short-term trading where profit margin often is related to
executed prices and slippage. Entry execution in most instances is related to when the system
gives a signal. A breakout system often has competition at the breakout level, for example. Exit
execution, on the other hand, can be controlled through experiment. A short-term system must
establish, when the system is not a stop-and-reverse, the time at which a better exit can be
obtained. Should the trade exit on the close for the day, the opening of the next day, or at some
time between when volatility usually declines? The opening is usually emotional and can be both
an advantage or disadvantage. The closing is used in most systems because it is the most rational
and eliminates overnight risk.
Another means of executing an entry or exit is scaling. This is done more by institutions,
which have large positions they need to accumulate or distribute, but it can equally be useful for
the smaller-sized trader or investor, who can accommodate more than one standard position size.
Scaling is the entering or exiting a position over time in small pieces. The initial execution
accomplishes part of the goal of the system, and over time, entries may be added at more advan-
tageous prices. If they do not, at least a small position has been entered.

Chapter 23 Money and Risk Management 577
MONITORING SYSTEMS AND PORTFOLIOS
All systems and portfolios must be monitored for changes in behavior. The obvious change is
when the system is running a series of losses larger than usual. There are methods of monitoring
the system that will warn of changes, however, before any substantial loss is incurred.
Bryant (2001) suggests the following methods. Calculate the average profit factor over a
moving number of trades—say the last 20 trades—just as in an oscillator such as the stochastic.
Plot this calculation and then run a moving average through the plot and watch the behavior of
the profit factor window to its moving average. The profit factor should always be above 1.0, and
minor oscillations should be ignored. Any drift lower, however, is a warning of something poten-
tially wrong. The recent calculation of a profit factor window should be compared with the entire
history of profit factors with a t-test to see if the deviation from the moving average is significant.
Perform a test run to see if the strings of wins and losses are within a normal distribution—
that is, if they are random or not. If no dependency is present, smaller size positions should be
traded after a win and larger after a loss. If the test shows a positive dependency, the run streak is
significant and positions should be reduced until the last trade is a win, at which point position
size can be increased.
The equity curve of the system should be checked periodically. One method is to sum the
ptg
profits and losses over a specified number of trades—say 30—and plot this figure in time. The
sum should remain positive, or equity momentum is declining. Another common method of
watching the equity curve is to calculate a moving average of equity. Breaking of the moving
average is not necessarily a signal for action but is a warning. If a forward line is calculated or a
trend line plotted and broken, action likely should be taken, as the system performance is deteri-
orating for some reason. Often when these signals of danger arise, the position size in the system
is reduced until evidence of recovery is seen or the problem resolved.
The sum or average of the percent of winning trades over a specified number of trades will
tell if there is a change in runs. A z-test can test whether the differences in proportions or percent-
ages are significant and worth investigating further.
IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG
Occasionally a portfolio model breaks down completely. Murphy’s Law takes hold, and every-
thing that can go wrong does. At that point, the remedy is to close down the system and exit all
positions. A standard for closing the entire portfolio model is a dollar or percentage stop, usually
around 20%. No system should sustain that amount of loss without adjustment.
CONCLUSION
It pays to understand that trading and investing are not just a matter of entry into positions. Tech-
nical signals are useful for entry, but technical understanding of risk is even more important.
Remember the law of percentages and how difficult it is to recover from losses. Investing and

578 Part VIII System Testing and Management
trading are a matter of determining and controlling loss of capital. Entry is easy; best exit is dif-
ficult. Money management consists of a number of ways to measure and to protect from the risk
of loss either in individual trades or in complete systems. Exit strategies and the principles of
position size are likely the most important aspects of any portfolio model. Amateur investors and
traders do not often utilize these risk control measures, but if they did, considerably fewer disas-
ters to pride and portfolios would result.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. You have tested a system and find that it has a losing percentage of 25%.
a. What is the chance of having a run of three losses?
b. What is the chance of having a run of four losses?
c. What is the chance of having a run of five losses?
2. Explain what is meant by the martingale betting system.
3. You have tested a system, and it has an MDD of 30%. You are willing to have a 45% draw-
down. How might you use leverage with this system to maximize your return, given the ptg
level of risk you are willing to take?

APPENDIX OBJECTIVES ptg
By the end of this appendix, you should be familiar with
• The difference between descriptive and inferential statistics
• How to calculate common measures of central tendency and dispersion
• The process of regression
• The basic premises and statistics related to MPT
Because financial asset prices are numbers that often change with high frequency, it is not sur-
prising that statistical techniques, which primarily concern the analysis of numerical data, have
been applied to investing in a variety of ways. According to Lind, Marchal, and Wathen (2002),
statistics is “the science of collecting, organizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting data to
assist in making more effective decisions” (p. 3). In this appendix, we examine the major statis-
tical and quantitative techniques that have been used in connection to stock analysis, although
some of the techniques also apply to other assets. The primary goal of the appendix is to acquaint
you with these methods, not present them in detail.
RETURNS
In finance, we often refer to an investment’s return. Suppose that we buy a stock for $50, hold it
for one year while earning a $2 dividend, and then sell it for $53. We calculate the stock’s return
as follows:

More generally, we can express the formula for returns as the following:
R ( Pt D t P t 1)
P
t 1
This formula can apply to bonds, options, futures, and so on. The only difference is that the
term for dividends would be replaced with interest or any other additional inflow over the period.
We usually talk about return, even though the return might not represent a realized gain.
Even if we continue to hold a stock, we can still talk about our return over the previous year;
essentially, we assume that we did sell it and calculate the return based on that assumption. There
are some important reasons for focusing on returns rather than prices. We learn about them later
in this appendix.
PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS
The foundation behind most of statistics is probability. Probability is concerned with the ques-
tion: Is it likely that the observed outcome occurred purely by chance? The notion of chance is
tricky. It is a topic that can lead to deep philosophical debates. For example, we could ask, “Did
ptg
life on earth appear purely accidentally (by chance), or was it somehow determined through
another mechanism?” If something is not random, then we say it comes about through a deter-
ministic process.
We can think about stock prices in terms of random versus deterministic. Are stock prices
random? Alternatively, are stock returns random? On the other hand, are the deviations from an
average return random, while the average return is stable? As we saw in Chapter 4, “The Techni-
cal Analysis Controversy,” researchers have debated these questions and continue to debate these
questions. Regardless of your viewpoint, probability concepts and statistical concepts are widely
used in the study of investments.
One key concept in statistics is called independence. If two events are independent, then
whatever outcome there is from the first event does not affect the probability of the outcome for
the second event. Suppose you start flipping a coin that is perfectly weighted so that the proba-
bility of a tail is 1/2 and the probability of a head is 1/2. You flip the coin five times and get five
heads in a row. What is the probability of a head on the next flip? It is tempting to say that there
is a greater probability of a tail than a head because flipping six heads in a row happens only
rarely; however, heads is just as likely as tails on the next flip. The events of the six flips are all
independent; later outcomes are not affected by earlier outcomes. If you are performing statisti-
cal tests to analyze investments, you have to consider the concept of independence. Many statis-
tical tests assume that the events are independent.
Two mathematical/statistical terms that are relevant to investing are permutations and
combinations. Let us assume that we are considering investing in five different stocks: Coca-
Cola (KO), Pepsico (PEP), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), and McDonald’s (MCD).
Permutations deal with rearrangements of items. Instead of listing the five stocks as KO,
PEP, IBM, MSFT, MCD, we could list them as IBM, KO, MCD, MSFT, PEP. With five unique
items, 120 different sequences could be listed. If we are going to buy some of each of the five
stocks, the order should not make a difference; therefore, we are not as interested in permutations.

Appendix A Basic Statistics 583
The concept of combinations has more application in investments. With combinations, the
sequence is not important. A portfolio consisting of KO and MSFT is the same as a portfolio con-
sisting of MSFT and KO. With five stocks, there are five different one-stock portfolios we could
form, ten different two-stock portfolios, ten different three-stock portfolios, five different four-
stock portfolios, and only one five-stock portfolio. It does not take very many stocks to generate
many different possible portfolios. Using 100 stocks as the universe to choose from, there are
75,287,500 5-stock portfolios that could be formed. Using 500 stocks (for example, the S&P
500) as the universe, there are 245,810,588,801,891,000,000 possible 10-stock portfolios.
In the previous discussion, we have assumed equally weighted amounts of the stocks. For
example, the amount invested in each of two stocks would be 50% of the total dollar amount
invested. If we consider unequal weightings, such as 78% of MSFT and 22% of KO, the number
of possible portfolios is limitless (assuming we can buy fractional amounts of each stock). You
can see how different investors could decide to hold very different portfolios, even if they are
choosing stocks from the same set, such as the Dow Jones Industrial stocks.
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
ptg
In statistics, a distinction is made between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
Descriptive statistics, as the name suggests, merely tries to describe or characterize data in a
shorthand manner. Inferential statistics tries to infer various statements about data based on
observed outcomes or assumptions about outcomes. We first examine descriptive statistics.
How would you describe a set of outcomes? How similar are the items in the set of out-
comes? Are the outcomes generally high or low? How are two or more sets of outcomes related
to each other? Do they tend to be alike or different? Do the outcomes seem to be linked to time?
In other words, are outcomes later generally different from outcomes at earlier times? We try to
answer some of these questions with descriptive statistics.
Measures of Central Tendency
A logical starting point in describing a set of data is to ask: What is the typical outcome? In sta-
tistics jargon, typical outcome is called central tendency. There are several different measures of
central tendency, each one approaching things from a slightly different perspective.
To illustrate the different measures, assume that we have the following monthly return data
for nine months (January–September 2004) for PepsiCo (PEP): 1.4%, 9.8%, 4.1%, 1.2%, –2.1%,
1.4%, –7.2%, 0.0%, –2.2%.
Mean
The first measure of central tendency (and the one most frequently used) is the mean. This is
what we would normally refer to as the average. To calculate the mean, we would total the values
for the nine months and divide by 9:

==================================================

584 Part IX Appendices
Notice that the average value, 0.7%, is not one of the observed values, even though we are
in effect saying that it is average outcome.
Median
The second measure of central tendency is the median. To calculate the median, we must first
arrange all the outcomes in rank order (this just means that we list them from lowest to highest).
The outcome that divides the list into two equal parts is the median. In this case, the median is
1.2%. Half of the outcomes are above 1.2%, while the other half are below 1.2%. The median
often is used when either the distribution of outcomes is skewed to more high values or more low
values, rather than being symmetric.
Mode
The third measure of central tendency is the mode. The mode is the outcome that occurs with the
highest frequency. In the preceding list, the mode is 1.4%. If the figures had more decimals, like
1.368%, there would likely not be any outcome that occurred more than once. In that case, the
mode would not be meaningful. This is why it is unlikely that someone would refer to the mode
when analyzing stock return data.
ptg
Geometric Mean
The three measures of central tendency just described are standard in statistics textbooks. How-
ever, there is another measure of the mean that often is used in finance: the geometric mean. The
mean described earlier is called the arithmetic mean. To illustrate the difference between the
arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, consider a four-year investment asset with annual
returns of 90%, –40%, 60%, and –50%. The arithmetic mean is calculated by adding the four
outcomes and dividing by 4. Doing this, we get a value of 15%, which sounds quite good as an
annual return. However, consider someone who had started with $1,000 and invested in the asset.
After year 1, he/she would have $1,900. After year 2, the investment would be worth $1,140.
After year 3, it would be worth $1,824. Finally, at the end of year 4, he/she would have only
$912. What happened to the 15% return of the arithmetic mean? Well, this example illustrates the
weakness of arithmetic means, especially when used with percentages.
The geometric mean in this example would be calculated by taking the fourth root (due to
four outcomes) of (1.90) (0.60) (1.60) (0.50), subtracting 1, and getting –2.3%. The 1.90 comes
from adding 1 to the decimal representation of 90%. By multiplying the initial investment of
$1,000 by (1.90) (0.60) (1.60) (0.50), we get $912, which was the ending value of the invest-
ment, referred to as terminal wealth. When we compute the terminal wealth divided by the initial
investment, we take the nth (where n is the number of outcomes) root of that number, and then
subtract 1 to get the geometric mean. If we were using a financial calculator, we could find the
geometric mean by putting the terminal value of $912 into the FV register, 4 into the n register,
$1,000 into the PV register, and then solving for the %i, or interest rate. Therefore, the geomet-
ric mean return is the same as what is called the compound rate of return.
It is important to understand the difference between the arithmetic mean, which is the
“average” we usually hear quoted, and the geometric mean. The geometric mean has a more
direct bearing on how much you will actually earn over the life of an investment. The geometric

mean will always be less than the arithmetic mean, with one minor exception: They will be equal
if the return is identical in every period. The greater the variability in the returns, the greater the
difference will be between the two measures. The previous example, with returns changing from
–50% to +90% over just a four-year period, illustrates this point. Because investors are probably
more interested in a high geometric mean return than a high arithmetic mean return, a good
investment maxim is: Beware of Volatility!
You will probably have minimal use for the mode in analyzing stock returns. However, the
arithmetic mean, median, and geometric mean all have their uses. The mean, either arithmetic or
geometric, is the most common measure.
Measures of Dispersion
In finance, there are many ways to think about the term “risk.” One way is to view risk as uncer-
tainty about outcomes. If there is more variability in outcome set A than in outcome set B, we
usually consider A to be the riskier choice. From the previous discussion about geometric mean,
we know that it will be harder to reach a certain level of terminal wealth with a highly volatile
investment.
The two main measures of volatility are the variance and standard deviation. These are
closely related because the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard ptg
deviation is used more frequently because it has the advantage of being in the same units as the
mean; the variance (being equal to the squared standard deviation) is in units that are difficult to
interpret.
For simplicity, let us assume that we have only four years of annual returns and want to
calculate the standard deviation. Assume that the returns are 12%, –5%, 21%, and 12%. We can
easily add these four numbers and divide by 4 to get the mean of 10%. Next, we compute the
squared deviations from the mean and total them. Finally, we divide by 3 and take the square
root. This is shown next (where σis used to denote standard deviation):
You might be wondering, as most people do, why we divided by 3 instead of 4. We could
divide by 4 depending on how we interpret what we are doing. In statistics, we talk about a sam-
ple versus the population. The population is the entire set of possible outcomes or entire set of
entities. For example, we can think of the adult population in the United States. A sample is
when we examine a few outcomes or a few of the entities in the set and try to make inferences
from them about the entire population. For example, we could conduct a survey of 1,000 ran-
domly chosen adults in the United States as our sample. Therefore, in our numerical example,
we could divide by 4, if we are assuming that these outcomes represent the entire set of out-
comes. However, because we are probably interested in what outcomes may occur for many
periods in the future, we can interpret the three outcomes as a sample of the population. For
some complex reasons, we divide by 3 instead of 4 to get what is called an unbiased estimate.
The number 3 in this case is referred to as degrees of freedom.

==================================================

586 Part IX Appendices
Initially, there were 4 degrees of freedom. However, when we calculate the mean, which
we need for the standard deviation, we are said to have used up 1 degree of freedom. Because we
have 4 – 1 = 3 degrees of freedom remaining, we use that in the denominator. In our case of only
4 outcomes, the choice of 3 or 4 makes a significant difference in the answer. However, if we
had, say, 101 observations, the choice of dividing by either 101 or 100 would not make much dif-
ference. It is probably wise not to worry too much about whether or not you use n (the number of
observations) or n – 1 in the denominator; usually it will not make much difference.
With the concept of standard deviation in hand, we can now see a situation where using
returns leads you to a different place than using prices. Suppose we observe the following prices
for a given stock: 40.00, 44.00, 48.40, and 53.24. If we compute the mean, we get 46.41 with a
standard deviation of 5.70. However, if we ignore any possible dividends and compute returns,
they are 10%, 10%, and 10%. Notice that when we compute returns, we end up with one less
observation because we use up one observation by focusing on changes in price. We need a
beginning price to compute the first period’s return. Alternatively, we need an ending period
price to calculate the return in the last period. Using returns, we have a mean of 10% and a stan-
dard deviation of 0%.
If we think of risk as volatility, we now have a slight dilemma. If we focus on prices, we
say that the stock is risky due to the variability, which is measured by the standard deviation of
5.70. However, if we focus on return, we might say there is no risk at all because there is no ptg
volatility in the returns, and we have a standard deviation of 0%. Which view is correct? Note
that the lack of volatility is due to a strong upward trend in the price. Remember the saying, “The
trend is your friend”? We have just illustrated a possible statistical justification for that statement.
There is no one correct view; you just have to be aware of what is happening and the implications
of it for returns compared with prices.
Relationships Between Variables
Up to this point, we have considered statistics for just one variable. It is now time to broaden our
perspective and consider more than one variable. As we could expect, things start getting more
complicated.
With one variable, we had a measure of variation called variance. The two-variable ver-
sion of variance is covariance. It is calculated in a manner similar to variance. Let us use four
months of stock returns for PepsiCo (PEP) and Coca-Cola (KO) to illustrate the calculation.
PEP’s returns for January–April 2004 were 1.4%, 9.8%, 4.1%, and 1.2%. The returns for KO
over the same period were –3.0%, 1.5%, 1.2%, and .05%. The mean return for PEP over the
period was 4.125% (with standard deviation of 4.008%), while the mean return for KO was 5.0%
(with standard deviation of 2.076%). To calculate covariance, we subtract the mean from each
PEP observation, subtract the mean from the corresponding KO observation, multiply the results,
add them together, and divide by the number of observations minus 1. So, we get (the covariance
between i and j is denoted as cov ):

Appendix A Basic Statistics 587
We saw that a major problem with variance was that the units of measurement were not
meaningful. The same problem exists with covariance; the covariance value is hard to interpret.
With variance, we solved the problem by taking the square root of the variance. With covariance,
we solve it in a different manner—we divide the covariance by each of the standard deviations.
This produces a number that can only range from –1 to +1. We call this number the correlation
coefficient. Using the example from the previous covariance calculation, we get the following:
This result means that PEP and KO were positively correlated to a reasonably strong
degree over the period.
If we have observations of a variable at consecutive time intervals, we refer to the variable
as a time series variable, time series data, or just time series. If the correlation coefficient
between two variables is +1, the two variables are perfectly correlated. In this case, when vari-
able X goes up, Y goes up. When X is down, Y is down. If the variables are perfectly negatively
correlated with a correlation coefficient of –1, the opposite is true—when X is up,Y is down, and
vice versa. What does a correlation coefficient of 0 mean? It means that there is no discernible
relationship between the two variables. If X is up, there is nothing meaningful that you can say
ptg
about the value of Y; it could be up or down, or stay the same.
There are two basic ways to picture time-series correlation relationships between two vari-
ables. The first is to graph the two variables against time; the second is to plot one on the x-axis
and the other on the y-axis. Figure A.1 shows an example of the first type using monthly returns
for Coke (ticker = KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) from January 2000 through December 2004. The sec-
ond method is shown in Figure A.2.

Look at Figure A.1. Notice that there is a general tendency for KO to be up when PEP is
up, and for KO to be down when PEP is down. If the two stocks had been negatively correlated,
they would have generally been moving in opposite directions. The actual correlation coefficient
for the two stocks during this time was 0.489. If we draw two stocks at random from the S&P
500 and measure the correlation coefficient for their returns, a typical value would be for about
0.2 to 0.5, which we would call weak positive correlation. We would expect a higher value for
KO and PEP, compared with two randomly chosen stocks, owing to the fact that they are in the
same industry.

Now, consider Figure A.2. In this case, we see the positive correlation from the fact that a
line of best fit (to be explained shortly) drawn through the returns slopes from the southwest
quadrant to the northeast quadrant. If the stocks were negatively correlated, the line would go
from northwest to southeast. What if the correlation was 0? In that case, the scatter of points
would look like a shotgun scatter around the center; there would be no discernible relationship,
and the best-fitted line would be horizontal.
In the previous discussion about correlation, we spoke of a line of best fit. We were inti-
mating about doing a linear regression least-squares fit through the points. Suppose we had the
same data points as we had in Figure A.2 for two variables, X and Y. If we were to draw a line
such that the sum of the squared difference between the actual data points and our line was min-
imized (in other words, the line in question produced a lower sum than every other conceivable
straight line), we would call it the least-squares regression line, or line of best fit. Statisticians
have worked out the equation for such a line, so that you can calculate the intercept and slope of

the least-squares regression line without actually having to plot the data and experiment with var-
ious lines. The equation for a line is often denoted as Y = a + bX. Using this notation, the equa-
tions for the line are as follows:
where n is the number of observations, and X is the ith observation of the X variable. The sum-
i
mation symbol, n X, simply means to add up all the X observations. The other summations work
i
in a similar manin1er.
This can all be done extremely easily in Excel. There are several different ways to have
Excel do regression calculations, but one easy method is to have it put the line and equation on a
chart of the data, as was done in Figure A.2. Because we are using the KO/PEP data, we would
interpret this equation as saying, “KO’s returns can be estimated by taking the return for PEP in
a given month, multiplying PEP’s return by 0.4564 (the slope), and adding –0.0063 (the inter- ptg
cept).”
There is a very nice side benefit to the correlation coefficient. If we square it, we get a
value called the r-squared or coefficient of determination. Because the correlation coefficient
can only have values between –1 and +1, the r-squared value will be between 0 and 1 (because
squaring results in a nonnegative number). Furthermore, this value is a measure of the goodness-
of-fit. If we get an r-squared of 0.45, we are explaining 45% of the variability in KO’s returns
through its relationship with PEP’s returns. The higher the r-squared, the better the fit. In our
case, the r-squared value is 0.158, saying that we have explained 15.8% of the variation in KO’s
returns with our equation. This might sound extremely low to you. However, remember that we
said typical correlation coefficients between two stocks at random are usually between 0.2 and
0.5? That means that one stock’s returns can typically explain about 4%–25% (obtained by
squaring 0.2 and 0.5) of another stock’s returns. In many cases, the correlation coefficient is even
less than 0.2, meaning that the r-squared may be close to 0.
Before moving on, it is worthwhile to pause and think about what we just said about typi-
cal correlations between stock returns. Stocks do generally tend to move up and down together,
as evidenced by positive correlation. However, the relationships are not hard and fast, but quite
loose. Sometimes people refer to stock prices as being very noisy. By this, they mean that any
relationships are subtle and tenuous. In communication theory, people talk about the signal-to-
noise ratio. Imagine listening to a radio broadcast of a speech. With no interference and perfect
transmission, the words in the speech, which correspond to the signal, are easily identified and
understood. If there is heavy interference—because the radio station is far away, there is bad
weather, or someone is using a poor hair dryer in the house—there is much noise. The more
noise, the lower the signal-to-noise ratio and the harder it is to understand what is being said.
Similarly, stock prices are noisy with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Any patterns or relationships
that do exist are not easy to discern.

The portion of the unexplained Y variable in each period is called the error term or resid-
ual. Let us examine a specific case to illustrate this. In May 2000, PEP’s return was 11.414%,
while KO’s was 12.963%. Using the regression line equation in Figure A.2, we would estimate
KO’s return as 4.579% (0.4564 (cid:2)11.414% – 0.63%). Note that we changed the intercept value
of –0.0063 to percentage notation of –0.63%. The error in our estimate is 8.384% (12.963% –
4.579%). When we perform regression, we implicitly assume that the error terms are random and
have no relationship with each other. However, particularly using time series data, the error terms
themselves may be correlated with each other, which is called autocorrelation or serial depend-
ence. There is a statistical test called the Durbin-Watson test that helps detect autocorrelation. If
autocorrelation is present, the fitted regression line may be inaccurate.
In a regression, the variable being explained is called the dependent variable. The variable
doing the explaining is called the independent variable, or explanatory variable. We can extend
the idea of regression to more than one independent variable. This is called multiple regression.
Logically, two explanatory variables are better than one, three are better than two, and so on. In
fact, virtually any additional explanatory variable we include in a regression will improve the r-
squared. For example, we might include monthly average temperature in Paris as an additional
series to help explain stock returns. This would not make logical sense, and the temperature in
Paris would not have causal relationship to stock returns, but the r-squared would probably
increase. When using more than one independent variable, researchers examine what is known as ptg
the adjusted r-squared. The adjusted r-squared value penalizes the r-squared value as more inde-
pendent variables are added to the regression equation. In effect, it helps balance benefit versus
cost; is it beneficial to add a particular variable?
One frequently encountered problem in performing multiple regressions is what is called
multicollinearity. This occurs when there is reasonably strong correlation between two or more
of the independent variables. Suppose, for example, that we were trying to understand the factors
that affected the stock returns during 2005 of all the S&P 500 stocks. Suppose that for each
stock, we had values of changes (2005 values minus 2004 values) in assets, sales, earnings, and
shareholder’s equity. There would probably be strong links between most of these variables, so
that there would be a high degree of multicollinearity. Several problems are caused by multi-
collinearity, however. One of the main problems is that it clouds the picture concerning which
independent variables are statistically significant.
The term statistically significant revolves around the idea: How likely is it that I would
observe this outcome purely based on chance alone? Consider a coin-flipping contest. Imagine
that 80,000 spectators in a football stadium are asked to stand up and flip a quarter. If it lands
heads, they stay standing. If not, they sit down. After the first toss we would expect that approx-
imately 40,000 people would still be standing. After the next toss we would expect about 20,000
to remain standing. It would probably take us about 16 tosses to identify the champion coin-
tosser. So if someone in the crowd were to flip 16 heads in a row, we shouldn’t be surprised.
A threshold of 5% is often used to signify statistical significance. If we observe something
that we would expect to see less than 5% of the time based strictly on chance alone, then it might
be deemed statistically significant. If we demanded a more stringent test, then we might use a
threshold of 1%. But, just because something is statistically significant that does not mean it is
economically significant. A statistician might say that tests of a certain trading rule show that a
statistically significant relationship has been found. However, a trader might say: “Yes, that’s
great, but due to transactions costs and other factors I can’t make money with this rule.”

INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
With inferential statistics, we try to use observed data to infer things about general characteristics
of the observed data or characteristics of additional observations. We often test whether a certain
hypothesis is true or false. A hypothesis might be something like, “The slope of this line is 1.” To
test hypotheses, we must make some assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the assump-
tions we make about what is known as the probability distribution.
The most well-known of all probability distributions is the normal distribution, also
referred to as a Gaussian distribution because it was first formulated by Karl Gauss, the eigh-
teenth-century German mathematician. It is also known as the bell curve, due to its bell shape. It
only takes two parameters—the mean and standard deviation—to describe a given normal distri-
bution; there are infinitely many normal distributions due to an infinite number of combinations
of values for the mean and standard deviation. The normal distribution has three important char-
acteristics:
• It is bell-shaped, with its peak at the center. The mean, median, and mode are all
located at the peak.
• It is symmetric about the mean. ptg
• It approaches the horizontal axis asymptotically at the left and right tails of the bell
curve. It extends infinitely in both directions.
The normal distribution also has special importance due to what is called the central limit
theorem. If we take repeated samples from a population, calculate the mean of each sample, and
then plot the distribution of the sample means, they will approximate a normal distribution. As
the sample size increases, the approximation will improve. The central limit theorem has impor-
tant implications for a wide variety of statistical tests.
There are two rule-of-thumb values concerning the normal distribution that are useful to
memorize. First, approximately two-thirds of the outcomes will lie (either above or below)
within one standard deviation of the mean. Second, approximately 95% of the outcomes will lie
within two standard deviations from the mean.
Are stock prices normally distributed? No, you cannot have negative prices, and with any
normal distribution, every number is possible, both positive and negative, even though some val-
ues are highly improbable as outcomes. Are stock returns normally distributed? No, because we
cannot have a return lower than –100%, but we can have returns greater than 100%. However,
returns come much closer to being normally distributed than do stock prices. Looking at PEP’s
monthly returns from January 2000 through December 2004, we see what is displayed in Figure
A.3.
This graph is a histogram. There are various “buckets” for counting returns. Here, the
buckets are in intervals of 5.0%. Over the 60-month period, 26 returns fell in the interval from
0.0% to 5.0%. The size of the buckets will have an impact on the appearance; too few will clump
everything together, while too many will produce a very flat histogram. In this example, we can
see that PEP’s returns do not look like a perfect normal distribution, but they do generally follow
a bell shape. There are formal statistical tests designed to assess whether a given sample of out-
comes can reasonably be said to follow a normal distribution.

Stock returns cannot logically be expected to exactly follow a normal distribution due to
the impossibility of returns less than –100%. However, what if we take the change in the loga-
ptg
rithm (or log) of the prices? These are called log-returns. Do these numbers follow a normal dis-
tribution? If they do, we say that the data follows a log-normal distribution. Taking the log
produces numbers that range from 0 to ∞. For stock returns, log-normality is a more reasonable
assumption. However, the exact distribution of stock returns has been tough to pin down. Finance
researchers are still arguing over the best distribution to use for stock returns, as we saw in our
discussion in Chapter 4.
Earlier in this appendix, we used the term “degrees of freedom” when discussing standard
deviation. This term also surfaces in descriptions of probability distributions. The easiest way to
think of it is just as a parameter needed to specify the distribution. For the normal distribution,
we needed two parameters, due to the need to specify the mean and standard deviation.
Three very important distributions are the Chi-Square, t, and F distributions. All of these
are based on various manipulations of standard normal variables. A standard normal variable is
one that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We can eas-
ily transform most variables into standard normal variables. Suppose that we observe a value of
24 from a sample that has a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 5. First, we calculate how far
the observation is from the mean. We do this by subtracting the mean of 20 from the value of the
observation of 24, leaving us a value of 4. Next, we divide the standard deviation into our num-
ber, which gives us 0.8 (4/5). This tells us that the observation is 0.8 standard deviations from the
mean.
The Chi-Square distribution is based on the sums of standard normal variables. If it is based
on the sum of two standard normal variables, we say that it has two degrees of freedom. If it is
based on the sum of three, it has three degrees of freedom. As the number of degrees of freedom
increases, the distribution begins to approach the shape of a normal distribution. The Chi-squared
distribution primarily is used for goodness-of-fit tests. The term “test statistic” refers to a value
computed from a sample that is used to test a particular hypothesis. A hypothesis could be some-
thing like: “Are all the colors of M&M candies in a bag equally likely to occur?” Many test statis-
tics are known to follow a Chi-Square distribution, so this distribution has many applications.

The t distribution or Student’s t (Student was a pen name used by the person who first
worked out its applications) is used often in statistics. The t distribution applies when the true
standard deviation is unknown (which is most of the time) and is especially important for small
samples. The t distribution converges to the normal distribution as the number of degrees of free-
dom (the sample size minus 1) increases. It closely approximates a normal distribution by 30
degrees of freedom. The t distribution is symmetric, similar in shape to the normal distribution
but with wider tails. It commonly is used to test the statistical significance of regression coeffi-
cients (such as the intercept and slope). An application of the t statistic is shown later.
The last major commonly used distribution is the F distribution. The F distribution is based
on the ratio of two variables, each of which follows a Chi-Square distribution. It primarily is used
to test whether samples have the same variance. It is used in regression as an overall measure of
goodness-of-fit because it is the ratio of explained variation to unexplained variation.
Now let us see how some of these things come together in looking at some output from a
linear regression. Let us use PEP’s monthly returns as the Y variable and the S&P 500 monthly
returns as the X variable over the 2000–2004 period. We can use Excel to run the regression.

Let us start with the intercept and slope of the regression. The intercept, which is clearly
labeled, is 0.0096. The slope is labeled X Variable 1 under Coefficients and has a value of
0.3321. The slope is approximately the beta of the stock, which is explained later. Technically,
monthly returns on the risk-free asset (T-bills or T-bonds might be used) should have been sub-
tracted from each variable, but we are trying to keep things simple. As a practical matter, in many
cases it won’t matter much if we don’t subtract risk-free asset returns. The beta, a measure of
risk, for an average stock is 1. We see that PEP’s beta is less than that of an average stock. We
also see the r-squared value, which is labeled R-Square of 0.0747. This means that our regression
explains 7.47% of the variation in PEP’s returns over this period. Below the slope value of
0.3321, we see the t statistic value of 2.1640. As a rule of thumb, t values over 2 are statistically
significant, so this exceeds that hurdle. The item labeled P-Value shows the probability that we
would observe the given value strictly by chance alone. The P-value of the slope t value is
0.0346, which says that the probability that this t value happened purely by chance was only
3.46%. In most academic research, P-values less than 5% (or sometimes 1%) are considered sta-
tistically significant. Analyzing this information is called a t test. Finally, let us consider the F
value of 4.6828. This has a significance value of 0.0346, the same as the t value. It essentially
tells you the same information as the t in this case. Unless you are performing a multiple regres-
sion, the P-value of the t of the slope and the significance value of the F statistic will be the same.
The other numbers on the output have their uses, which you can learn from a standard statistics ptg
textbook.
What do the results tell us? The results show that our regression equation does seem to
explain part of the variation in PEP’s returns. The results are significant from a statistical point of
view. However, we are only explaining 7.47% of the variation in PEP’s returns. Whether this is
useful from a practical point of view depends on other factors.
MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY
We all learned portfolio theory as children: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket! However, MPT
began in 1952 with the work of Harry Markowitz. He worked out many mathematical relation-
ships between groups of stocks, or portfolios. Some of the key results are as follows:
• The mean return of a portfolio is a simple weighted average of the mean returns of the
individual stocks.
• The standard deviation (of returns) of a portfolio is a quadratic function.
• The standard deviation of a portfolio is almost always less than a simple weighted
average of the individual stock standard deviations.
• Even with weak positive correlation, there are significant benefits to diversification.
• If an investor is only concerned with the mean return and standard deviation of a port-
folio, it is possible logically to eliminate many portfolios from consideration.
• For large portfolios, the variance of each stock contributes little to the overall portfolio
variance. However, the covariance of each stock’s returns with the returns of all the
other stocks is quite important.

We will flesh out these points as we go along.
Consider combinations (or portfolios) of two stocks, X and Y. Assume that we have esti-
mates of the expected return (mean) and standard deviation of returns for each stock. We can cal-
culate the expected return of a portfolio of X and Y by taking a simple weighted average of the
individual expected returns. Thus, denoting the expected return on the portfolio as R we have
p,
the following:
R w R w R
p x x y y
How about the standard deviation of a portfolio of X and Y? That is more complicated. The
formula involves a squared term (therefore, it is a quadratic equation) and looks like this:
w w w w r
p x x y y x y x y xy
The r term in this equation is the correlation between stock X and stock Y. If this value
xy
was equal to 1 (perfect correlation), this equation would simplify to the following:
However, perfect correlation is virtually impossible in the real world. With r < 1, the ptg
xy
standard deviation of the portfolio is always less than a simple weighted average of the two indi-
vidual standard deviations. This means that there are significant benefits to diversification in
terms of risk reduction.
We can see how portfolios look in what is called risk-return space in Figure A.4. This fig-
ure is based on annualized monthly returns for PEP and KO over the 2000–2004 period. Note the
curved line, which shows the quadratic nature of the standard deviation relationship. Also, note
that a portfolio consisting of 80% KO and 20% PEP is a better choice than KO by itself. Why do
we say this? We say it because points that are to the northwest are preferable because they offer
more return for less risk. The correlation of returns between the two stocks was 0.489 over this
period. Therefore, we see that there are significant benefits to diversification, even if the two
stocks have weak positive correlation.
How would the curve change if the correlation was greater? The line between the two
ends, representing 100% of one of the stocks, would become straighter. If the correlation was
perfect (+1), it would be a completely straight line. How would the curve change if the correla-
tion was smaller? It would bend more toward the vertical axis. In the extreme case of perfect
negative correlation (–1), there would actually be one portfolio possibility that would touch the
vertical axis with a standard deviation of 0. However, the most common case, as stated earlier, is
correlation between 0.2 and 0.5. Therefore, the curve in Figure A.4 is typical in terms of its gen-
eral shape.
When we extend our calculations to more than two stocks, the expected return is still a
simple weighted average of the individual returns, while the standard deviation has terms con-
taining the variance of each stock plus cross-terms (similar to 2w w (cid:5) (cid:5) r ). When we graph
x y x y xy
possible portfolio combinations for three stocks, we get a picture like the one in Figure A.5.

If we were to extend our set of possible stocks to four, the variance of the portfolio would
be calculated by adding up all the terms in the following matrix and dividing by 3 (see Figure
A.6).
The terms along the diagonal, shown inside the smaller boxes in Figure A.6, are the vari-
ances of each of the four stocks. The off-diagonal terms are covariance terms. Because the
covariance of stock 1 with stock 2 is the same as the covariance between stock 2 and stock 1, the
matrix is actually symmetric around the diagonal. Notice that there are four variance terms and
12 covariance terms. The covariances are roughly three times (12 to 4) as important in the port-
folio variance calculation. As the number of stocks under consideration grows, the individual
variance terms become less and less important. For example, consider adding a fifth stock. The
matrix would expand to 25 cells. The variance of stock 5 would be one of the 25 cells. However,
there would be eight additional covariance terms added to the matrix, representing stock 5’s
covariances with the other four stocks. For large portfolios, the variance of each stock is rela-
tively unimportant; what is important is how each stock co-varies with the rest of the stocks in
the portfolio. This idea hints at what is called the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), to be
discussed shortly.

Let us return to Figure A.5. Which portfolio would we actually want to hold? Before we
answer that question, we need to look at another concept. Consider the diagram in Figure A.7
that shows estimates of the mean and standard deviation for the returns on five stocks. Which
investment(s) is/are the most attractive? To begin, we assume that investors will not bear more
risk without the likelihood of more return. In investments jargon, we are assuming that investors
are risk-averse. With this assumption, it becomes clear that we would prefer points to the north-
west on the diagram. Stock A is preferable to Stock B because it has higher return for the same
risk. The same argument can be made concerning C and D. We can also argue that A is preferable
to C because it has less risk for the same return. In portfolio theory-speak, we say that A domi-
nates B, B dominates C, and A dominates C. That leaves us with A and E. There is no clear way
to say which one an investor would prefer. It depends on his/her tolerance for bearing risk. A
more aggressive investor would opt for E, while a less aggressive investor would opt for A. The
fact that A and E dominate the others means that they form what is called the efficient set.

FIGURE A.7 Efficient set
Portfolio theory was all fine and good, but there were still two important hurdles in apply-
ing the equations. First, Markowitz did not specify how to get the inputs. In other words, he
offered no prescribed method for coming up with the estimates of expected return and standard
deviation. Of course, one could use historical data to come up with estimates, but how much data
would be needed? Sixty months of monthly returns? Fifty-two weeks of daily returns? There was
no clear answer. Second, as the portfolio size increased, the number of inputs became exponen-
tially large. For a 100-stock portfolio, an investor would need 100 expected returns, 100 standard
deviations, and 4,950 correlation coefficients. With today’s computing power, it would not be
difficult to calculate these inputs from a given sample of historical data, but in the early 1960s,
this was a formidable computing task.
By 1964, a computationally easier method, with some added theory, had been developed.
William Sharpe has received most of the credit for this. The theory became known as the Capital
Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM. This theory was based on several simplifying assumptions, such as
no transactions costs, no taxes, and other assumptions. However, the most important assumption was
that of homogeneous expectations. This means that all investors view the inputs to portfolio theory
)%(
nruteR
We can extend the efficient set concept to what is called the efficient frontier. Let us return
to Figure A.5 once again, focusing on some additional aspects of it. Portfolios along the upper
edge of the curve from P to Q (which is the point at stock three) represent the efficient frontier.
These portfolios have either the highest return for any given value of standard deviation, or the
lowest standard deviation for any given level of return. These are the portfolios that would be of
most interest to rational investors. The particular portfolio along P–Q that an investor would
choose would depend on his/her risk tolerance. We are assuming that investors only care about
two things: expected return and standard deviation. This perspective is called a mean-variance
framework.

in the same manner, and that they agree on the expected returns and standard deviations of all stocks
and their correlations (or covariances). With this assumption, all investors identify the same efficient
frontier. Next, we add the assumption that a risk-free asset (like U.S. Treasury bills) exists.
Returning (for the last time) to Figure A.5, consider the line that starts at the risk-free rate
and is just tangent to the efficient frontier. The point of tangency is labeled as portfolio M. The
question “which portfolio should I hold?” now becomes “what combination of the risk-free asset
and portfolio M do I want to own?” That is true because combinations of the risk-free asset and
portfolio M lie along the line from the risk-free rate to portfolio M and beyond. Portfolios on this
line dominate (in portfolio theory-speak) all those that lie below. This means that this line has now
become the efficient frontier. Portfolio M has now taken on some special significance. Every
investor wants to hold the risky portfolio. This means that all investors own a chunk of M, which
is a portfolio consisting of all stocks (because every stock must be held by someone, everyone has
to hold some of every stock). Investors willing to bear more risk might put all of their money in M.
Investors who are more cautious might put only 30% of their money in M and 70% in the risk-free
asset (T-bills). Either way, both hold the stocks in M in the same proportions.
From these ideas, it can be shown (we will not go through a tedious derivation) that the
expected return r on any stock i is given by the following equation, which we will call the
i
CAPM equation:
ptg
This means that βis the product of the correlation coefficient between the stock and the
market as a whole times the standard deviation of the stock relative to that of the market. So, if
the stock’s correlation with the market is 0.4 and its standard deviation is three times that of the
market, then its βis 1.2 (0.4 (cid:2)3).
For many years, investors had thought about expected return like this:
For example, the expected return on a corporate bond would be the yield on a U.S. Treasury
bond, a risk-free asset (risk-free in terms of default risk) of the same maturity, plus a premium for
default risk, plus possibly a premium for liquidity risk. To calculate the expected return on the stock
of that same company, an extra risk premium would be added for the fact that common stockhold-
ers have a residual claim and, thus, common stock has higher risk than the company’s bonds.
Therefore, the CAPM equation has the same basic structure that people had been using for
many years. The difference is that the risk premium is quantifiable. Note that all of the risk
comes about through the relationship between the stock and the market. This is risk that cannot
be diversified away, referred to as nondiversifiable risk. It is also called systematic risk. Beta is
a measure of systematic or systemwide risk. All companies have some similar risk because they
operate under the same laws, the same tax structure, the same political leadership, the same mon-
etary policy, and so on. However, these things will affect different stocks differently. Companies
will also have higher systematic risk, or betas, if they have more debt or have a cost structure
with higher fixed costs (as opposed to variable costs).
Does the CAPM work? Yes and no. There have been many debates about how to test the
CAPM. The evidence in support of the CAPM is mixed. Individual stock betas tend to be highly

unstable. For example, remember that we calculated the beta for PEP over the 1995–1999 period
using monthly returns. The beta we got was 1.466. When we did the same calculation over the
2000–2004 period, we got 0.332. (Remember that we performed this calculation in the earlier
discussion about regression.) It is possible that if we did some in-depth analysis of PEP over this
period, we could rationalize the difference. However, sometimes company betas seem to change
from one period to another without an obvious reason. However, portfolio betas tend to be more
stable. If a particular mutual fund has a beta of 1.18 and the stock market is generally up over a
certain period, the return on that mutual fund would most likely exceed that of the S&P 500. If
the market were down, the fund’s performance would probably be worse than that of the market.
In spite of the various problems with betas, they are heavily quoted and used. This is partly
because there is no good alternative.
What is the beta for the market as a whole? Because the covariance of an asset with itself
is the same as the asset’s variance, and the correlation of any asset with itself is 1, the expression
for β,r i simplifies to 1. In practice, the S&P 500 is often used to represent the market portfo-
im
m
lio. A stock with a beta greater than 1 is an above-average risk stock. If the stock’s beta is less
than 1, its risk is below average.

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Performance measurement can refer to calculations done at what we will call the microlevel or at
what we call the macrolevel. At the microlevel, in Chapter 22, “System Design and Testing,” we
discussed various measures for assessing the performance of a particular trading strategy.
Now we need to look at the macrolevel. We address things at the macrolevel by posing the
question, “How do we tell whether an investor’s overall investment performance has been good
or bad?” This is of particular interest to people who are hiring someone else to manage their
money, such as a mutual fund portfolio manager. We want to determine whether the performance
is adequate given the risk.
One simple method of assessing performance is to measure reward per unit of risk.
Because we can earn the risk-free return by investing in a risk-free asset, like Treasury bills, it
makes sense to focus on the reward in excess of the risk-free return per unit of risk. Therefore, we
simply subtract the risk-free return from the average return from the investment and divide by the
standard deviation of the returns over the period of measurement. If fund ABC earned an average
return of 12% over the period with a standard deviation of 20%, while the risk-free return was
4%, our performance measure would be 0.4 (calculated as (12 – 4) / 20)). This measure is called
the Sharpe performance measure or Sharpe ratio, because it was first suggested by William
Sharpe.
Putting the same idea in CAPM terms, a logical measure is excess return per unit of beta,
which is known as the Treynor measure of performance. Suppose that in the previous example,
the beta of fund ABC was 1.1. This would lead to a Treynor measure of 7.27. (First subtract 4%
from 12%, yielding 8%; then divide 1.1 into 8%.)
Another measure related to beta is what is called Jensen’s alpha. Let us assume that we are
estimating the market risk premium, which is R – R, as 6%. Let us use the same numbers for
m f
fund ABC that we used before. With these estimates, we would estimate the fund’s expected
return as 10.6% (4% + 1.1 ×6%). We would next subtract the 10.6% from the actual return of
12% to get 1.4%, which would be the fund’s alpha. Therefore, alpha is a measure of excess

return, return beyond what we expect based upon the CAPM. Fund managers are sometimes said
to be “searching for alpha.”
Geometrically, we can see the Treynor and Jensen measures in Figure A.8. Suppose that
you use the Treynor and Jensen measures to rank two investments, X and Y. It is possible that
investment X will have the highest Treynor measure but the lower Jensen alpha. However, in
most cases, the ranking will be the same. There is some irony in the fact that the two performance
measures based on the CAPM’s beta don’t bear the name of Sharpe, who developed the CAPM.

FIGURE A.8 Treynor and Jensen performance measures
Geometrically, the Sharpe measure would look similar to the Treynor measure line drawn
in Figure A.8. The difference is that standard deviation would be used in place of beta on the x-
axis.
A relatively new (developed in 1994 by J.P. Morgan Co.) measure that is used to summa-
rize risk, especially at the overall firm level, is Value-at-Risk, known as VaR. Banks commonly
use this measure, and it is even used for regulatory purposes. VaR tells us in one simple number
the maximum loss that will occur (with 95% confidence under normal conditions) over a given
period, such as one day. Because no one can foresee the future, the phrase “will occur” is based
on certain assumptions. Let us say a certain investment firm is holding various U.S. and foreign
stocks. Consider the risk along three dimensions: the risk of holding U.S. equities, the risk of
holding foreign stocks, and the exchange rate risk. With VaR, you would analyze the variability
in these three components (you could divide it more finely into more components) and the corre-
lations between them. You would then roll all this information into a complex computer program
that would perform the VaR calculation and give you one number as the result. For example, the
VaR might be $3.6 million, meaning that there is less than a 5% chance that the firm would suf-
fer a one-day loss greater than $3.6 million. Due to the complexity of the calculations, this meas-
ure would normally only be used by financial institutions.

ADVANCED STATISTICAL METHODS
Some researchers have applied some very sophisticated statistical techniques to investment analy-
sis. It is beyond the scope of this book to go into detail concerning some of these advanced meth-
ods. However, we try to provide a qualitative understanding of some of the major techniques.
We used the term “time series” earlier in this appendix. It merely refers to data for which
we have observations in consecutive periods. Time series modeling refers to statistical tech-
niques for analyzing time series data.
When a researcher begins to analyze a given time series, the first question to ask is usually
this: “Is the series stationary?” You can think of stationary as being generally stable, with some
degree of structure. Stock prices are usually nonstationary because they are usually trending up
or down, or fluctuating with trends.
Earlier in this appendix, we talked about how returns are often used rather than prices.
Returns are often stationary. The stationarity of returns is a major advantage. It is not possible to
make statements that are very meaningful about a nonstationary series. Stationarity is tested
using what is called a unit root test. If the series has a unit root, it is not stationary. Therefore,
you hope to be able to reject the hypothesis that the series has a unit root.
It is possible for two series to both be nonstationary but for some mathematical (linear)
ptg
combination of the two series to be stationary. If this occurs, we say that the two series are coin-
tegrated. Cointegration analysis techniques have been applied in several areas of finance, but
there is probably great potential for additional applications of this method.
Major buzzwords in the finance academic community over the past 10 to 15 years are the
acronyms ARCH and GARCH. Because ARCH is a subset of GARCH, we focus just on it.
GARCH stands for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. This sounds
extremely complicated, and it is to some degree. However, the basic idea behind it is simple—
ordinary regression breaks down when you analyze many financial time series because the
volatility of the series changes over time.
When the volatility (you can think of this as the standard deviation of stock returns, for
example) of a series is not constant (not precisely constant, but at least generally constant or con-
sistent), we say it is heteroscedastic. If we think of periods like that before and soon after the
market crash of 1987 or the Internet bubble of the late 1990s, it is easy to imagine that volatility
changes over time.
Methods such as ARCH and GARCH are used to estimate volatility. There are three major
reasons why volatility estimates have increased in importance, as follows:
• The use of options contracts has increased dramatically in the past few decades. The
key input into option pricing models is an estimate of the asset’s volatility.
• There have been significant periods of changing volatility over the past few decades.
Examples are the stock market crash of 1987, the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the
Russian moratorium of government debts, the financial insolvency of Long Term Cap-
ital Management (LTCM) in 1998, the World Trade Center attack in 2001, the
accounting manipulations of Enron and other companies in 2002, and the 2008–2009
financial crisis.
• There has been increased use of VaR, which requires volatility estimates.

Appendix A Basic Statistics 603
One other term you may encounter is maximum likelihood. With maximum likelihood,
you work backward from the observed data to make inferences about the probability distribution
that produced those outcomes. You try to find the distribution that was most likely to be the
source of the outcomes. Maximum likelihood techniques can be applied to many different statis-
tical problems. It can even be an alternative to least squares in performing regression.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
The term artificial intelligence (AI) refers to using computers to mimic intelligent processes
found in the natural world. Researchers in AI have often overestimated their ability to produce
intelligent behavior or thought processes with machines. However, AI has definitely had some
success and will probably continue to exert greater impact on our society in the future. You only
have to look at the latest robotic devices in an electronics store to glimpse some of the potential.
We only briefly describe three of the major developments in AI: expert systems, neural networks,
and genetic algorithms.
To build an expert system, you need a cooperating expert. An expert system tries to model
the thinking process of someone who is an expert on a particular subject. For example, program-
ptg
mers might interview a doctor at length, trying to build various rules for decision making. For
example, the doctor might say that the first thing to do is take the patient’s temperature. If the
patient has a fever, you proceed along one set of steps. If the patient does not have a fever, you
proceed along another set of steps. As you can imagine, the list of steps would be extremely long
to diagnose many different illnesses. Some steps might lead to a dead end, where the system
would indicate that a doctor would need to be consulted; the situation would be beyond the capa-
bility of the expert system. If you had an expert investor like Warren Buffett, you could poten-
tially build a system that would mimic his stock selection process. However, researchers have
found that it is extremely difficult to encode the decision-making process of many experts.
Experts often seem to have a sixth sense in many situations that cannot be modeled.
The basic idea behind neural networks is to model, in a computer program, the network of
neurons that continually “fire” in our brains, causing us to sense, think, feel, and act. A neural
network consists of an input layer, an output layer, and some hidden layers in between. The
designer of the neural network decides how many layers should be between the input and output
layers and how the layers interact. In an investments application, company financial and stock
price data might be inputs, while buy/sell decisions would be outputs. Critics have complained
that neural networks are too much like a black box. You put in certain inputs and get out certain
outputs, but it is not very clear what is happening in the middle. This criticism does have some
validity; building a neural network is done more by trial and error than referring to an architec-
tural or engineering blueprint. Defenders of neural networks counter that it is possible to dissect
a neural network and uncover the inner structure.
Genetic algorithms (GAs) derive their name from the fact that they mimic certain genetic
processes such as mutation. GAs are optimization algorithms. They try to maximize or minimize
what is referred to as “fitness.”
Problems are mapped into strings of 1s and 0s. For example, let us consider stock selection
strategies. Positions 1 and 2 in the string might correspond to quartiles of ROE. A value of 00

604 Part IX Appendices
might mean that you pick stocks that are in the lowest quartile of ROE for a given group of
stocks. Similarly, values of 01, 10, and 11 would represent the other three quartiles. If we contin-
ued this scheme for other variables, we might be able to say that a certain string (pattern of 1s
and 0s) would mean that we select stocks that are in the highest quartile of ROE, highest quartile
of EPS growth, lowest quartile of P/E ratio, highest quartile of relative price strength, and so on.
Genetic algorithms typically start with a randomly generated population of strings. The
strings then undergo various genetic operations, such as mutation and crossover (where two
strings swap tails), and the population gradually evolves. The evolution is driven toward higher
values of fitness. In an investing application, fitness could be the return earned from pursuing a
certain strategy.
There are two major hurdles in using GAs: (1) mapping your problem into a string, the
process of problem representation, can be difficult; and (2) sometimes, particularly in investing
applications, seemingly obvious fitness values (called “fitness functions”) can produce poor
results because the system evolves toward a solution driven by uncommon quirks in the test data.
New refinements to the basic technique, such as genetic programming, may lead to useful
applications in the investing world.

RADER ERMINOLOGY
In the second half of this book, we cover strategies and tactics that can be used with technical
analysis systems and patterns. Many of these strategies require knowledge of trading terms and
how to tell a broker in trader language what to do. Here are some of the common terms used uni-
versally in the markets:
ptg
All or None (AON) Execute the entire order or none of it, but not some fraction.
Ask The price at which a seller is willing to sell.
Bid The price at which a buyer is willing to buy.
Day Order An order that, if not executed, expires at the end of the day. Most orders are assumed
to be day orders unless otherwise specified.
Downtick A downtick is the opposite of an uptick in that the next previous different price was
above the current price.
Fill or Kill (FOK) Execute an order immediately and completely, or cancel it.
Good ‘Til Canceled Order (GTC) or Open Order An order that remains in effect until exe-
cuted or cancelled. It usually has a time limit of several days to up to a month, at which time it
must be renewed.
Immediate or Cancel (IOC) An order that must be executed immediately or it becomes void.
Leaves The unexecuted balance of an order.
Limit, Limited Order, or Limited Price Order An order to execute a stated amount at a spe-
cific or better price.
Liquidity The ability of the market to absorb a reasonable amount of transactions with a mini-
mum effect on prices.
Long As opposed to short, a position of ownership. “I am long 100 shares of XYZ” means I own
100 shares of XYZ. “I am going long” means I am buying.
Market on Close (MOC) Execute at the close as near to the last sale as possible.

608 Part IX Appendices
Market Order An order to execute a stated amount at the bid or offer price currently available
in the marketplace. All orders are assumed to be market orders unless otherwise stated.
Not Held The broker is not “held” to the transactions on the tape. He can “work” the order.
Odd Lot Usually fewer than 100 shares.
Offer The price at which a seller is willing to sell.
Opening Only or OPG An order to be executed on the opening only and if not executed to be
cancelled. This is valid for market and limit orders.
Pegged Market An order is pegged to buy on the best offer and sell on the best bid.
Pull Back An order to withdraw a current bid or offer.
Quote The highest bid and the lowest offer in a given market at a given time, sometimes includ-
ing the volume at the bid and offer—usually called a “quote in size.”
Relative Allows the customer to enter a more aggressive price than the current market price, and
have the entered price stay within a fixed interval to the market should prices deteriorate.
Round Lot Usually 100 shares.
Scale An order to execute in increments—to sell into a rising market or buy into a declining ptg
market.
Scale Order A specific order to scale a specified amount at specific price variations.
Seat A membership in an exchange.
Short One has sold the security and owes it to the lender. “I am short 100 shares of XYZ” means
I have borrowed and sold 100 shares of XYZ and at some time must buy it back and return it to the
lender. “I am going short” means I am selling the security in anticipation of its price declining.
Short Covering Buy stock to return stock previously borrowed to make delivery on a short sale.
Short Sale A sale of a security that is not owned, usually entered in anticipation of a decline in
price. A short sale, because the security is not owned but must be delivered to the buyer, requires
that the security be borrowed (usually arranged by the broker) and at some time returned. When
the security is “covered” with a “buy to cover” order, the security is returned, and the profit or
loss in the position is determined by the difference between the price at which the security was
bought and sold. Sometimes, the broker cannot borrow the stock, for a multitude of reasons, and
the order to sell short will be denied.
Stock Ahead Other orders at the same price were placed on the book earlier and are ahead of the
current order. Precedence for orders is based on when they were placed. These earlier orders may
be executed without execution of the current order.
Stop Limit Order A stop order that becomes a limit order once the stop price is reached.

Appendix B Types of Orders and Other Trader Terminology 609
Stop Order An order to execute once a price reaches a certain level away from current price. A
stop order becomes a market order once the specified price is reached. It may not be executed at
the stop price. An example is “Buy 100 shares XYZ at 52 stop.” Presumably, XYZ is trading
below 52 currently, and the order states that should the price reach 52, then enter a market order
to buy 100 shares. This type of order is principally used as protection against a sudden decline (a
sell stop). For example, say you own 100 shares of XYZ at 50 and believe it will rise. To protect
yourself from a major loss, you place a “sell 100 shares XYZ at 48 stop” to sell out your position
at 48 or below when 48 is reached. Thus, if you are correct and XYZ rises, you profit, but if XYZ
declines, you limit your loss to approximately two points. A stop order can also be entered if
there is no current position, but if the analyst believes that a certain price is crucial and wants to
enter a position once that price is reached. The stop order is the most important order of all orders
because it can either enter a potential winning position or limit one’s risk.
Time in Force The time limit for the order to be entered or cancelled.
Uptick or Plus Tick A term used to designate that the last price is above the next earlier price.
A Zero Plus Tick is a term that designates the last price that is the same as the next earlier price
but still above the last different price. Short sales of stocks usually must be executed on an
uptick, though this rule may change soon. ETF short sales do not require an uptick, and neither ptg
do any futures markets. A downtick is the opposite of an uptick in that the next previous different
price was above the current price.
VWAP The Volume Weighted Average Price for a stock. VWAP is calculated by adding the dol-
lars traded for every transaction in that stock and dividing the total shares traded. It is used by
institutions to measure the effectiveness of executions and as a target for daily executions.
AN ORDER TICKET

following:
Contract Description:

Exchange
Security Type: Stock, Option, Future, Future Option, Warrant, Cash, Index, Bond
Currency
