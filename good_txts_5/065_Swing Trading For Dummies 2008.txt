Dedication
To my mother, my mother, and my mother — Maha Al-Hiraki Bassal. To my
father, Dr. Aly Bassal. And my sisters, Suzie and Sarah. To my loving wife,
Salma, and my brother-in-law, Hisham. And to my beloved nephew, Mostafa.
They have always supported me in easy and difficult times.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I don’t believe any experience could possibly have prepared me for the rigor-
ous schedule required to write a book. I can’t tell you how many weekends,
evenings, and holidays were required to write Swing Trading For Dummies.
The effort was, of course, worth it. But I did miss several episodes of Lost,
The Office, and other shows. Alas, the cost of writing books isn’t measured in
time alone.
Before I turn this section into an autobiography (which I should pitch to
Wiley as my second book, come to think of it: Omar Bassal For Dummies!), let
me thank those who deserve thanks (give credit where credit is due, I’m told,
is the way the kids are putting it these days). I first learned of this opportu-
nity through Susan Weiner, CFA — a skilled and professional investment
writer. Susan told me about a search Wiley was conducting to find an author
for this book. Marilyn Allen, my agent, pitched me to Wiley. I’m honored
Wiley offered me the opportunity to write this book. Thank you, Stacy
Kennedy, for your confidence in me and your buy-in.
Writing the book, as you may have gleaned from my previous comments, was
a grueling, tough process, and Kristin DeMint was an invaluable resource. She
was my project editor and made sure the book progressed. She often joked
that she knew nothing about swing trading. But her “weakness” was in reality
a strength. Not being an expert in the subject meant Kristin could offer help-
ful comments on what might confuse a novice when I made assumptions or
didn’t properly explain ideas. Kristin also kept a watchful eye when deadlines
approached. Oh how I didn’t want to draw her ire. (I’m half joking. She’s
actually a very sweet person . . . as long as I didn’t miss my deadline!)
As my trading mentor, Ian Woodward, once said: Many hands make light
work. In addition to Kristin, many Wiley staff members worked behind the
scenes. Russell Rhoads, the technical editor, ensured I wasn’t making things
up, and other editors — Todd Lothery, Jennifer Tucci, and Elizabeth Rea —
made sure my grammar made cents. (They must’ve missed this part!)
Though not involved directly in my project, per se, my family supported me
throughout. That meant a lot. It’s not something I can put into words — even
as a writer.

Introduction
I
wish I could tell you that swing trading is fast and easy and leads to
overnight profits that will make you an instant millionaire. Just buy my
five CDs today to discover how you can swing trade to massive riches! Or
attend one of my training conferences coming soon to a hotel near you: “How
I Swing Trade in My Bathing Suit!” (Film cuts to a testimonial from an “actual”
client wearing a Hawaiian T-shirt: “I’ve tried the Omar Bassal Swing Trading
Technique [this is patented, of course] and I made more than $5,000 on one
trade alone!”)
Okay, back to reality. Swing trading isn’t going to lead to overnight wealth.
Period. Anyone who tells you different is either lying or has made an incred-
ibly risky trade that turned out positive by the grace of God. You can go to
Las Vegas and bet $10,000 on the color black at the roulette table and pos-
sibly double your money (your odds are slightly less than 50 percent). But is
that a sound plan?
Of course not. And it’s no different when it comes to swing trading.
At best, as a novice swing trader, you’ll produce market returns in line or
slightly above the overall market. If you’re really besting the markets, it may
be because you’re taking an inordinate amount of risk that may eventually
wipe away your account assets. And even as a stellar swing trader, expect to
produce returns of 20 percent or possibly 30 percent annually. (If you want
quick profits, first make sure you’re an impeccable market timer, and then
look into day trading.)
Unlike day traders, swing traders hold positions over several days and some-
times for a few weeks. But similar to day traders, swing traders rely heavily
on signals from chart patterns and technical indicators to time their entries
and exits from securities. The goal of swing trading is to profit from short but
powerful moves on the long side (buying) and short side (selling) of the stock
market.
Swing trading also differs from the buy-and-hold approach to investing. Long-
term investors may hold a security through periods of weakness that may
last several weeks or months, figuring that the tide will eventually turn and
their investment thesis will be proven correct. Swing traders don’t care for
such poor performance in the near term. If a security’s price is performing
poorly, swing traders exit first and ask questions later. They’re nimble and
judicious in choosing potential opportunities.

Swing Trading For Dummies
About This Book
In Swing Trading For Dummies, I introduce you to the strategies and tech-
niques of the swing trader. Moreover, I cover topics given short shrift in
some trading textbooks — topics that largely determine your swing trading
success. For example, whereas many textbooks focus on chart patterns and
technical indicators used in buying or shorting stocks, this book goes one
step further to cover the importance of money management, journal keeping,
and strategy planning. Although these subjects are less glamorous than look-
ing at charts, they’re actually more important — because even exceedingly
skilled chart readers will fail if they devise a flawed system, take unnecessary
risks, and don’t learn from their mistakes.
Here are some of the subjects this book covers:
(cid:1) Calculating investment returns: This is one of those unglamorous
topics, but if you don’t properly calculate your returns, you’ll never
know whether you’re doing any better than the overall market. The
process is simple if you’re not adding or taking away funds from your
account, but the procedure can get more complex if you frequently with-
draw or add funds.
(cid:1) Keeping a journal: The word journal seems to be a lot less offensive to
people’s sensibilities than diary. A journal is like a trading coach, telling
you what you did wrong or right in past trades and helping you to avoid
repeating mistakes you made previously. Just knowing the symbol,
price, and date of your trades isn’t going to cut it. This book shows you
the key features of a valuable trading journal.
(cid:1) Managing your risk: The most important chapter in Swing Trading For
Dummies is Chapter 10, where I explain how to manage your portfolio’s
risk. As remarkable as this may sound, even if you get everything wrong
except your risk management, you can still make a profit. Van K. Tharp,
a trading coach, once said that even a totally random entry system can
be profitable if your risk management system is sound.
(cid:1) Focusing on fundamentals: This book differs from other swing trading
books in its emphasis on the fundamentals of securities. All too often,
swing traders pay attention only to the chart and disregard the company
behind the chart. You don’t need to spend 20 hours a day analyzing a
company’s financial statements — swing traders don’t have that kind of
time on their hands. But it’s essential to find out the basics and apply
the most important measures in your trading.
(cid:1) Paying attention to the popular (and easy) chart patterns to trade:
Dozens of chart patterns appear from time to time in securities’ price
patterns, but not all of them are sound or based on investor psychology.
That’s why I focus on the tried-and-true chart patterns to give you the
critical ones to look for.

Introduction
(cid:1) Outlining your swing trading plan: A trading plan must outline when
you’re in the market and when you’re not. It must detail your criteria for
entering and exiting securities. Your plan should also cover what to do
when a trade doesn’t work out, as well as how much you risk and how
you handle your profits.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following conventions to assist you in reading this text:
(cid:1) Bold terms are for emphasis or to highlight text appearing in bullet
point format.
(cid:1) Italics are used to identify new terms that you may not be familiar with.
I also use italics to highlight a difference between two approaches (for
example, higher than the first case).
(cid:1) Monofont is used as text for Web sites.
Charts and figures used in this book have text next to them explaining the
essential point the figure conveys. These captions make it easy to skip to dif-
ferent charts and take away the critical point made in each one.
Foolish Assumptions
I made several assumptions about you when I was writing this book. I’m
assuming that you
(cid:1) Know how to trade securities online
(cid:1) Plan on trading stocks or exchange traded funds
(cid:1) Have little or no experience swing trading but are well versed in the
basics of trading in general
(cid:1) Are able to access and use Internet Web sites that cover research, chart-
ing, news, and your portfolio account
(cid:1) Have the will to change your current trading approach
(cid:1) Don’t have an MBA, CFA charter, or CMT designation and need some
terms and techniques explained clearly
(cid:1) Aren’t a genius and don’t think of yourself as the character Matt Damon
plays in Good Will Hunting
(cid:1) Appreciate humor and popular movie references

Swing Trading For Dummies
If you want to trade other types of securities — like currencies or
commodities — you may want to pick up Currency Trading For Dummies
by Mark Galant and Brian Dolan, or Commodities For Dummies by Amine
Bouchentouf (both published by Wiley).
How This Book Is Organized
This book has five main parts. You may not need to start at Part I and pro-
ceed from there. You may be better served beginning at Part II or Part III if
you already know the basics of swing trading.
For that reason, I explain the five parts as follows so you can determine
which part or parts you need to focus on.
Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
Swing trading can be a rewarding endeavor for those who have the time and
interest in trading securities over the short term. But you need to pack your
backpack before you set out on the journey. Part I helps you do just that.
This part introduces you to swing trading and provides an overview of the
investment landscape. You also discover the brokers that cater to swing
trading and the two main trading strategies (fundamental analysis and
technical analysis).
Part II: Determining Your Entry and
Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Swing traders rely heavily on technical analysis: the art and science of trading
securities based on chart patterns and technical indicators. But it’s easy to
get lost in the world of technical analysis given how many different chart pat-
terns and indicators exist. When should you use this indicator over that one?
Part II explains the ins and outs of technical analysis for everyone from the
neophyte to the market expert.
Part III: Digging Deeper into the
Market: Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis is given short shrift in most swing trading books, but I
introduce you to the important fundamental measures you may be overlooking.

Introduction
Fundamental analysis doesn’t have to be a scary science that only institutions
use to their advantage. You, too, can profit from simple fundamental ratios and
measures. In this part, I cover the basics of financial statements and the criteria
you can use to screen for under- or overvalued stocks.
Part IV: Developing and Implementing
Your Trading Plan
Your trading plan is your map in the swing trading world — or your GPS, if
you prefer to have directions read to you. Your trading plan outlines what
you trade, how often you trade, how many positions you own, and so on. In
creating your plan, you must decide how much to risk on each position and
when to exit (for a profit or a loss). You also need to know how to calculate
your performance so you can tell whether you’re ahead or behind the overall
market.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens includes “Ten Simple Rules for Swing Trading.” Stick to
these rules and you’re unlikely to make any major mistakes that take you
out of the game. But you need to know more than what to do; you must also
know what to avoid at all costs. “Ten Deadly Sins of Swing Trading” covers
ten “sins” that are sure to lead to subpar performance. Maybe not today or
tomorrow, but eventually, these sins will catch up with you.
And what would a book be without an appendix? In this book’s appendix, I
recommend several valuable resources you should use to help you with your
swing trading.
Icons Used in This Book
I use icons throughout the book to highlight certain points. Here’s what each
one means:
This may be somewhat self-explanatory, but the Remember icon refer-
ences subject matter you should remember when swing trading. Often, the
Remember icon highlights a nuance that may not be apparent at first glance.
I don’t use the Warning icon often, but when you see it, take heed. As a swing
trader, you must always take action to ensure you’re able to swing trade
another day. I use this icon to point out subject matter that, if ignored, can be
hazardous to your financial health.

Swing Trading For Dummies
The Trader’s Secret icon signals that the material presented is quite technical
in nature. Most often, the technical tidbits are my own personal insights based
on experience.
A Tip icon marks advice on making your life easier as a swing trader. If Swing
Trading For Dummies were a second grade classroom, this icon would signal
my jumping to the end of the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears and tell-
ing you how it ends. The Tip icon cuts through the fluff and tells you exactly
what you need to know.
Where to Go from Here
Like all For Dummies books, this book is modular in format. That means you
can skip around to different chapters and focus on what’s most relevant to
you. Here’s my recommendation on how best to use this book depending on
your skill level:
(cid:1) For a newcomer to swing trading: I strongly encourage you to begin
with Part I and proceed to Parts II and IV. You can skip Part III if you plan
on exclusively using technical analysis in your swing trading.
(cid:1) For the swing trader looking to refine his or her skills: Parts III and IV
will likely be of most value to you because you probably already have
a good bit of technical analysis under your belt. Help in designing your
trading plan, which I cover in Part IV, may be the best way to improve
your results. Remember, Chapter 10 is the most important chapter in
this book.
(cid:1) For the swing trading expert: You may benefit most by using this book
to target specific areas for improvement. The index or table of contents
can help you identify which parts of the book to target.

Y
ou can earn a living in this world in many different ways. The most
common way is by mastering some skill — such as medicine in the case
of physicians, or computers in the case of information technology experts —
and exchanging your time for money. The more skilled you are, the higher
your compensation. The upside of mastering a skill is clear: You’re relatively
safe with regard to income. Of course, there are no guarantees. Your skill
may become outdated (I don’t believe that many horse carriage manufactur-
ers are operating today), or your job may be shipped overseas. You also have
a maximum earning potential given the maximum hours you can work with-
out exhausting yourself.
But there’s another way to make a living. Swing trading offers you the pros-
pect of earning income based not on the hours you put in but on the quality
of your trades. The better you are at trading, the higher your potential prof-
its. Swing trading takes advantage of short-term price movements and seeks
to earn a healthy return on money over a short time period.
Swing trading is a good fit for a minority of the population. It involves tremen-
dous amounts of responsibility. You must rely on yourself and can’t be reck-
less or prone to gambling. If you’re not disciplined, you may end up with no
income (or worse).
This book is a guide for those of you interested in swing trading. To under-
stand swing trading, you should understand what it is and what it isn’t.

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
What Is Swing Trading?
Swing trading is the art and science of profiting from securities’ short-term
price movements spanning a few days to a few weeks — one or two months,
max. Swing traders can be individuals or institutions such as hedge funds.
They’re rarely 100 percent invested in the market at any time. Rather, they
wait for low-risk opportunities and attempt to take the lion’s share of a signif-
icant move up or down. When the overall market is riding high, they go long
(or buy) more often than they go short. When the overall market is weak,
they short more often than they buy. And if the market isn’t doing all that
much, they sit patiently on the sidelines.

Chapter 1: Swing Trading from A to Z
Swing trading is different from day trading or buy-and-hold investing. Those
types of investors approach the markets differently, trade at different frequen-
cies, and pay attention to different data sources. You must understand these
differences so you don’t focus on aspects that are only relevant to long-term
investors.
The differences between swing trading
and buy-and-hold investing
If you’re a buy-and-hold investor in the mold of Warren Buffett, you care
little for price swings. You don’t short because the overall market trend has
generally been up. You study, study, and study some more to identify prom-
ising candidates that will appreciate over the coming years. Short-term price
movements are merely opportunities to pick up securities (or exit them) at
prices not reflective of their true value. In fact, buy-and-hold investors tend
to have a portfolio turnover rate (the rate at which their entire portfolio is
bought and sold in a year) below 30 percent.
Buy-and-hold investing is an admirable practice, and many investors should
follow this approach, because it’s not as time-intensive as swing trading and
not as difficult (in my opinion). But if you have the work ethic, discipline,
and interest in swing trading, you can take advantage of its opportunities to
(cid:2) Generate an income stream: Buy-and-hold investors are generally con-
cerned with wealth preservation or growth. They don’t invest for cur-
rent income because they sometimes have to wait a long time for an idea
to prove correct. Swing trading, on the other hand, can lead to current
income.
(cid:2) Time your buys and sells and hold a basket of positions to diversify
your risk: The majority of people aren’t interested in closely following
their finances and are best served by investing in a basket of domes-
tic and international mutual funds covering stocks, commodities, and
other asset classes. Swing traders can hold a few securities across asset
classes or sectors and generate higher profits than those who invest
passively.
(cid:2) Profit from price declines and excessive euphoria through shorting,
which buy-and-hold investors simply can’t replicate: The essence of
shorting is that it allows traders to profit from price declines as opposed
to price increases. But shorting involves risks not inherent in buying.
When you buy a stock, your loss is limited to the amount you trade.
Your potential profit is unlimited, but you can only lose what you put

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
into the security. Shorting carries the exact opposite payoff. A stock
can go up over 100 percent, but the theoretical maximum amount of
profit a short position can make is 100 percent if the security’s price
falls to $0.
Although shorting allows you to profit from the decline of a security, the
potential losses from shorting are theoretically unlimited, and the poten-
tial gains are limited to the amount you short. So if a security jumps up
in price by 30 or 40 percent or more, you may end up owing your broker
a tremendous amount of dough.
The differences between swing
trading and day trading
Opposite the buy-and-hold investor on the trading continuum is the day
trader. Day traders don’t hold any positions overnight. Doing so would
expose them to the risk of a gap up or down in a security’s price that could
wipe out a large part of their account. Instead, they monitor price movements
on a minute-by-minute basis and time entries and exits that span hours.
Day traders have the advantage of riding security price movements that can
be quite volatile. This requires time-intensive devotion on their part. Near-
term price movements can be driven by a major seller or buyer in the market
and not by a company’s fundamentals. Hence, day traders concern them-
selves with investor psychology more than they do with fundamental data.
They’re tracking the noise of the market — they want to know whether the
noise is getting louder or quieter.
But it’s not all cake and tea for day traders. They trade so often they rack up
major commission charges, which makes it that much more difficult to beat
the overall market. A $5,000 profit generated from hundreds of trades may
net a day trader a significantly reduced amount after commissions and taxes
are taken out. This doesn’t include additional costs the day trader must sus-
tain to support his or her activities.
Swing traders also face stiff commissions (versus the buy-and-hold inves-
tor), but nothing as severe as the day trader. Because price movements span
several days to several weeks, a company’s fundamentals can come into play
to a larger degree than they do for the day trader (day-to-day movements
are due less to fundamentals and more to short-term supply and demand of
shares). Also, the swing trader can generate higher potential profits on single
trades because the holding period is longer than the day trader’s holding
period.

Chapter 1: Swing Trading from A to Z
What Swing Trading Is to You:
Determining Your Time Commitment
Getting started in swing trading requires some reflection. Before you rush
out to buy that slick PC or set up that brokerage account, you need to think
about what kind of swing trader you want to be. (Yes, swing traders come in
different shapes and sizes.)
Your first step is to determine just how much time you can commit to swing
trading. You may be a full-time trader for a firm, in which case you should
consider yourself as trading for a living. Or you may be doing this part time
for income with the intention (and hope) of becoming a full-time trader.
Many swing traders have full-time jobs and have little time to devote to
trading, so they trade primarily to improve the returns of their investment
accounts. Or perhaps they’re already in retirement and swing trade to grow
their assets over time. These swing traders watch the market during the day
but rely on orders placed outside market hours to enter or exit their posi-
tions. And if they trade in tax-deferred accounts, like an Individual Retirement
Account, they can ignore the tax issue.
The point is, you can swing trade whether you have a full-time job or not, but
you need to make adjustments depending on whether you’re able to watch the
market all day. And by the way, watching the market all day long doesn’t nec-
essarily improve your returns. In fact, doing so can lower them if it causes you
to overtrade or react to market gyrations.
Swing trading as your primary
source of income
If you intend to swing trade as your primary means of generating income,
be prepared to spend several months — if not years — gaining experience
before you’re able to give up your job and trade from home full time. Swing
traders who trade full time devote several hours a day to trading. They
research possible trades before, during, and after market hours. And they
handle pressure well.
Many traders find that they can’t handle the stress of trading full time. After
all, if swing trading is your main source of income, you face a lot of pressure
to generate consistent profits. And you may be more tempted to gamble if
you encounter a string of losses. What many traders fail to realize is that the
correct response to a series of losses isn’t more trading but less trading. Take
a step back and evaluate the situation.

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
Swing trading for a living isn’t difficult in the sense that to excel at it requires
some kind of amazing IQ level or insane work ethic. Rather, it requires an
incredible amount of self-restraint, discipline, and calm. A swing trader who
trades for income must always be unemotional. When things don’t work out,
he or she doesn’t try to get even but moves on to another opportunity.
So don’t quit your day job just because you generate impressive profits for a
few months. The name of this game is to always have enough capital to come
back and play again. If you plan on living off of $5,000 per month, for example,
you can’t expect to generate that kind of profit on $30,000 of capital. That would
require a monthly gain of 16.67 percent! Some of the best all-time traders in the
world topped out at returns of 20 to 25 percent annually over 20 or 30 years.
Swing trading to supplement income
or improve investment returns
This category likely applies to the lion’s share of swing traders. Swing trading
with an eye on earning additional income or improving the returns on your
portfolio is less stressful than swing trading for a living. You still have some-
thing to fall back on if you make a mistake, and you can swing trade while
holding down a full-time job.
Part-time swing traders often do their analysis when they get home from
work and then implement trades the following day. Even though they may
not be able to watch the market all the time, they can enter stop loss orders
to protect their capital.
If you want to eventually swing trade full time, you should go through this
phase first. Over time, you’ll be able to determine how well you’ve done. And
if you follow the other recommendations in this book (like keeping a trad-
ing journal, which I cover in Chapter 3), you’ll learn from your mistakes and
improve your techniques.
Swing trading part time is suitable for those individuals who
(cid:2) Have a full-time job
(cid:2) Can devote a few hours a week to analyzing markets and securities
(cid:2) Have a passion for financial markets and short-term trading
(cid:2) Have the discipline to consistently place stop loss orders
(cid:2) Are achieving subpar returns in their current investment portfolios from
a financial advisor or third party
(cid:2) Don’t gamble with their own money and are unlikely to fall prey to dou-
bling down or taking major risks

Chapter 1: Swing Trading from A to Z
If you fit these criteria, then part-time swing trading may be for you. When
you first start out, I recommend swing trading with just a small portion of
your portfolio so any early mistakes don’t prove too costly. Although paper
trading can be beneficial, it can’t compare to the emotions you’ll be battling
as a swing trader when you put your own money on the line.
Swing trading just for fun
Some swing traders get a rush from buying and selling securities, sometimes
profiting and sometimes losing. Their motivation isn’t to provide or supplement
current income. Rather, these swing traders do it for the excitement that comes
from watching positions they buy and sell move up and down. Of course, this
can lead to significant losses if they abandon the rules designed to protect their
capital — rules that I outline throughout this book (specifically in Chapter 10).
If you want to swing trade solely for fun, my advice is: don’t. I recommend that
you get your kicks at a bowling alley or basketball court. The danger of trading
for fun is that you’re using real money with real consequences. You may begin
to risk more of your capital to satisfy your need for excitement. If you lose, you
may take extreme action to prove yourself right in the end, like putting all your
money into one or two securities. By then you’re really in the realm of gambling.
If you insist on trading for fun, at least restrict yourself to a small amount of
your assets and never touch your retirement nest egg. Remember that you’re
competing with traders who are motivated by profit, not just excitement.
That gives them an advantage over someone who just enjoys the game.
Sneaking a Peek at the Swing
Trader’s Strategic Plan
Plan your trade and trade your plan.
Fail to plan and you plan to fail.
Countless clichés address the importance of a trading plan. A trading plan is
the business plan of your trading business. Without the plan, you’re likely to
fall into the trap of making things up as you go. Your trading will be erratic.
You won’t improve because you won’t have the records on your past trading.
You may think your trading plan is in your head, but if you haven’t written it
down, for all intents and purposes it doesn’t exist.

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
Throughout this book I cover all the important parts of swing trading strategy in
detail. In the following sections, I preview the critical parts of the strategy, trim-
ming them all down into one neat little package. (For more on your trading plan,
see Chapter 10.)
The “what”: Determining which
securities you’ll trade
Your trading plan should identify the securities you trade. As a swing trader,
you can choose from a variety of securities:
(cid:2) Public equity (stock): This category is perhaps what you’re most famil-
iar with. Common stocks, American Depository Receipts, and exchange
traded funds fall under this rubric. Swing traders often trade stocks
exclusively because of the variety, ease, and familiarity of trading cor-
porate stocks. Most stocks listed in the United States trade every day,
but stocks in foreign markets may trade infrequently (perhaps once a
week). To make your entries and exits as painless as possible, you must
focus only on those stocks that meet a specified level of volume. Trying
to sell 1,000 shares of a stock that trades 5,000 shares in a day can be
extremely costly. I recommend you use stocks due to the abundant
information on firms domestically and even internationally.
One of the beauties of stocks is how efficient they are to trade, partly
because they offer exposure to other asset classes. For example, you
can gain exposure to the commodity gold by trading an exchanged
traded fund with underlying assets in gold bullion. I stick to stocks
myself because that’s my area of expertise, and I recommend them
because of this exposure to other asset classes and because of the vari-
ety of positions you can choose from. But you may wish to trade other
asset classes as well — that’s your call.
• American Depository Receipts (ADRs): ADRs have become
increasingly important in today’s globalized world. Simply put,
an ADR allows U.S. investors to buy shares of foreign companies.
ADRs are quoted in U.S. dollars and pay dividends in U.S. dollars.
Trading ADRs is much more cost efficient than setting up accounts
in several foreign countries, converting your dollars into foreign
currencies, and so on. And because the economic growth of emerg-
ing nations is outstripping the growth of developed countries,
ADRs can offer strong profit opportunities. ADRs of companies
based in emerging markets (like Brazil or China) are sometimes
highly leveraged to a particular commodity, making ADRs one way
to profit from commodity price strength.

==================================================

Chapter 1: Swing Trading from A to Z
• Exchange traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are pooled investments. The
most common ETFs mirror the movement of an index (such as
SPY, a popular ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index) or a subsector
of an index. If you want to ride a coming tech bounce, you may be
better served trading a technology ETF than choosing a particular
tech company that may or may not follow the overall tech sector.
That’s because if you’re right on the move, you’ll profit from a
diversified technology ETF. However, a single technology security
may buck the trend. ETFs also offer you the ability to profit from
international indexes and commodities.
(cid:2) Closed end funds: These funds are basically mutual funds that trade on
a secondary exchange. Traditional, open end mutual funds are priced
according to their net asset value — or the value left after subtracting
the fund’s liabilities from its assets. Closed end funds are different.
They’re priced according to the supply and demand for shares of that
particular fund. Sometimes, a closed end fund will trade for more than
its net asset value; other times, it will trade for less. Closed end funds
may be an efficient way to profit from international markets.
(cid:2) Fixed-income markets: These markets include securities issued by gov-
ernments on the federal, state, and local level, as well as those issued by
corporations. The value of fixed-income securities depends on interest
rates, inflation, the issuer’s credit worthiness, and other factors. Because
the fixed-income market tends to have less volatility than stocks and
other asset classes, many swing traders usually avoid trading it.
(cid:2) Futures contracts: Standardized contracts to buy or sell an underly-
ing asset on a certain date in the future at a certain price are known
as futures contracts. Futures are traded on commodities and financial
instruments, such as equity indexes. Technically, the buyer and seller
don’t exchange money until the contract’s expiration. However, futures
exchanges require traders to post a margin of 5 percent to 15 percent
of the contract’s value. This means that traders can employ extreme
leverage, if they choose, by putting down only a small amount of the
contract’s value.
I strongly recommend avoiding the use of such extreme leverage
because of the potential to lose most, if not all, of your assets due to an
unexpected move in a security. Newcomers in particular should avoid
using leverage. Even experienced swing traders can become careless or
arrogant before the market educates them.

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
(cid:2) Commodities: This security type is perhaps the biggest asset class receiv-
ing attention today other than stocks. With the boom in the prices of every-
thing from gold to crude oil, commodities are attracting more money from
swing traders. Commodities — including energy commodities, agricultural
commodities, and precious metals — are traded in the futures markets.
You can profit from commodity price movements through stocks or
exchange traded funds. For example, swing traders wanting to profit
from movements in gold prices can trade streetTRACKS Gold shares,
which tracks the movement of gold bullion prices. But trading com-
modities involves risks and issues that differ from trading equities. (See
Commodities For Dummies by Amine Bouchentouf, published by Wiley,
for more information on trading commodities.)
(cid:2) The currency market: Often called the foreign exchange market or forex
market, the currency market is the largest financial market in the world.
According to the Bank of International Settlements, the average daily
turnover in the foreign exchange markets is $3.21 trillion. Like the futures
market, trading in the currency market allows for extreme leverage.
Not all brokers offer trading in foreign exchange, so make sure you check
whether your broker has the capability. Unlike stocks, trading in the
currency market is concentrated in a few currencies: the U.S. dollar, the
euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, and the Swiss franc.
If you plan on using fundamental analysis to complement your technical
analysis as a swing trader (see the definitions of both terms in the sec-
tion “Establishing your analysis techniques” later in this chapter), be
prepared to learn about the various factors that affect the value of foreign
currencies: inflation, political stability, government deficits, and economic
growth — to name a few. (See Currency Trading For Dummies by Mark
Galant and Brian Dolan, published by Wiley, for more information on trad-
ing currencies.)
(cid:2) Options: Investment contracts that give the purchaser the option, but
not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a specified price up
until the expiration date are known as options. Options are highly risky
and not efficient swing trading vehicles because of their illiquidity.
The “where”: Deciding where you’ll trade
Where you trade depends a great deal on what you trade. Stocks, commodi-
ties, currencies, and bonds trade on different markets.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX),
and NASDAQ list stocks based in the United States and abroad (they also
list other investment vehicles, like exchange traded funds, that enable you
to profit from movements in prices of commodities and other asset classes).
The NASDAQ differs from the NYSE and AMEX in that it’s completely elec-
tronic and allows for efficient transaction and order routing.

Chapter 1: Swing Trading from A to Z
Not all stocks trade on these markets. Recently, electronic communication
networks (ECNs) have emerged as an efficient way to match buy and sell
orders. ECNs connect individual traders with major brokerage firms. You
sometimes can get a better price by submitting orders to an ECN instead of
a broker. The easiest way to access ECNs is by subscribing to a broker who
provides direct access trading.
But swing traders can buy and sell other securities on other markets. For
example, if you want to trade an actual commodity, the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT) lists several commodities: ethanol, gold, silver, corn, oats, rice,
soybeans, and wheat. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) also lists
popular commodities like crude oil, coal, natural gas, and gold. But you must
consider the additional risk factors if you venture outside trading stocks. For
example, commodities require different margin requirements than stocks.
Not properly employing a risk management system can lead to losing your
entire capital on a single trade. Commodities also trade on different funda-
mentals than companies or fixed-income securities.
If you want to trade commodities, currencies, or other investment vehicles,
you need to trade via firms authorized to transact in those markets.
The “when” and the “how”: Choosing
your trading style and strategy
Whether you enter orders during or after market hours affects your entry and
exit strategies.
(cid:2) Part-time swing traders enter orders when markets are closed and rely
on limit and stop losses to execute this strategy.
(cid:2) Full-time traders, on the other hand, can execute their entries and exits
during the day and incorporate intraday price action into their timing
of trades. They also find more trading opportunities because they have
more time to devote to swing trading.
How you trade refers to your various trading strategies, which I outline in
this section.
Establishing your analysis techniques
Swing traders rely on two major analysis techniques: technical analysis and
fundamental analysis. Technical analysis, broadly speaking, encompasses
chart pattern analysis and the application of mathematical formulas to secu-
rity prices and volume. Fundamental analysis covers earnings, sales, and
other fundamentals of a company or a security.

==================================================

20
Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
In my experience, most swing traders rely solely or in large measure on
technical analysis. However, I explain both analysis techniques in this book
because I strongly believe that understanding and using both improves the
odds of success.
Both analysis techniques have their advantages:
(cid:2) Technical analysis can be quickly and easily applied to any market or
security. For example, a trained swing trader can use technical analysis
to quickly decide whether to buy or sell a security using chart patterns
of technical indicators. In contrast, a swing trader relying on fundamen-
tal analysis needs more time to read about a company, its business, and
its earnings before coming to a conclusion. Whether you’re trading com-
modities, currencies, stocks, or bonds, you can apply technical analysis
uniformly to these markets. In other words, if you know how to interpret
a chart, then the kind of security being plotted is largely irrelevant. In
my opinion, the ease of application is the biggest advantage technical
analysis has over fundamental analysis.
(cid:2) Fundamental analysis can answer questions that are beyond the scope
of technical analysis, such as, “Why is this security price moving?”
Swing trading on the long and short side based, in part, on fundamentals
is like having a head start in the 100-meter dash. Rallies and declines that
are driven by fundamentals are more profitable to trade than rallies and
declines that are simply the result of noise in the markets (such as a large
mutual fund liquidating or buying a position). Over the long term, security
movements are driven by the securities’ underlying fundamentals. Crude
oil prices rise when demand exceeds supply or when supply becomes
scarce — not, as technical analysis may superficially indicate, because
the chart developed a bullish formation. (Of course, crude oil — or any
security — can rise or fall due to non-fundamental reasons. But such
rallies and declines are often fleeting and not as strong as fundamentally
driven price moves.)
Some swing traders shy away from learning about a company’s funda-
mentals. Generally, fundamental analysis is seen as long, laborious, and
not always right. But you can improve your swing trading by getting to
the essence of a company’s fundamentals, even though it does require
extensive reading, researching, and modeling.
Just how much should you care about a company’s fundamentals? The
general rule of thumb is that the longer your investment horizon, the more
important fundamental analysis becomes. The shorter your horizon, the
less important fundamental analysis is in trading securities. This is because
short-term movements are driven by momentum, noise, and other factors.
Over the long term, however, fundamentals always win out.
But just because you understand how to apply fundamentals doesn’t mean
you’ll make money. Markets don’t rise simply because they’re undervalued,
or fall simply because they’re overvalued. Markets can remain under- or

Chapter 1: Swing Trading from A to Z
overvalued for long periods of time. That’s why I don’t recommend swing
trading on fundamentals alone. Fundamental analysis tells you which way
the wind is blowing so you’re prepared, but technical analysis provides the
important timing components.
Choosing candidates to buy
You can find promising securities in two main ways — the top-down approach
and the bottom-up approach. Both are covered in detail in Chapter 8, but
here’s a brief rundown:
(cid:2) Top-down: Swing traders who prefer the top-down approach identify
opportunities beginning at the market level, drill down to the industry
level, and finally look at individual companies. If you fit this category,
your entry strategy should begin with an examination of the overall mar-
kets, then trickle down to the major sectors in the market, and then to
the industries within the strongest or weakest sectors. At this point, you
rank the securities in the industry on some technical or fundamental
measure (more on that in Chapter 8). Then you select the securities that
meet your entry strategy.
(cid:2) Bottom-up: Swing traders who use the bottom-up approach are grassroots-
oriented individuals who look for strong securities and then filter promis-
ing ones by their industry groups or sectors. If you fit this category, your
approach begins with a screen of some sort (a screen is a quantitative
filter), sometimes depending on whether growth or value stocks are in
favor at that particular point in time. If that’s the case, you then compare
the relative strength of the growth and value indexes (and possibly also
the market capitalizations of the market). After identifying which securities
rank highest in the screen, you determine which securities meet your entry
rules, and then you trade only those securities that reside in leading or lag-
ging industry groups, depending on whether you favor buying or shorting.
Planning your exit
Most swing traders focus almost entirely on their entry strategy, but it’s the
exit strategy that determines when you take profits, when you take losses,
and when you exit a meandering position so you can put the capital to better
use. So although planning your entry is important, you need to spend equal
(if not more) time on your exit.
Your exit strategy is most likely going to be technically driven, and it’s threefold:
(cid:2) Determine when you exit for a profit. Don’t take profits based on a gut
feeling — rely on a trigger or catalyst instead. For example, some exit
strategies for profits stipulate that the time for departure arrives when
prices reach the implied target based on a chart pattern, or when shares
close below a moving average.
(cid:2) Determine when you exit for a loss. Your exit strategy for losses should
be based on the breach of a support level, a resistance level (in the case

of shorting), or some type of moving average (for example, the nine-day
moving average). (Support levels are simply price zones where securities
stop falling, and resistance levels are price zones where prices stop rising.)
This keeps your losses limited to some known quantity (barring, of
course, a gap up or down in the security price, which must be addressed
by proper position sizing and other risk management techniques).
(cid:2) Determine when you exit if a trade generates neither profits nor
losses. That is, it meanders sideways and results in dead weight. Some
swing traders exit a position quickly if it doesn’t perform. I prefer to give
a position a few days to prove itself one way or the other. So I recom-
mend exiting a position after ten days if it hasn’t hit your stop loss level
or triggered a profit-taking signal.
You should outline your exit strategy by making sure your trading plan
addresses when you exit for profit, loss, and capital redeployment.
Settling on when you’ll net long or short
Swing traders sometimes short securities to profit from price declines. If you
choose to incorporate shorting into your trading strategy, you must deter-
mine when you’ll be net long or net short.
Net long means that the majority of assets you’ve invested in are on the
long side of the market. Net short means that the majority of assets you’ve
invested in are on the short side of the market. And if your long and short
assets are equal, then you’re market neutral.
Generally, the decision to be net long or net short is driven by the state of the
major market index. When the S&P 500, for example, is in a bull market, then
most swing traders are net long. When the S&P 500 is falling, most swing traders
are net short. And when the market is in a trading range, swing traders may be
market neutral.
Preparing your risk management plan
The most important part of your trading plan is how you manage risk. Risk man-
agement, which I cover in detail in Chapter 10, addresses how you manage risk
on an individual security level and on the portfolio level as a whole. A trading
plan with a weak entry strategy and a weak exit strategy can still be profitable if
the risk management strategy limits losses and lets profits run.
In order to effectively manage your risk, you need to account for the follow-
ing aspects of your trading plan:
(cid:2) How much you risk on an individual position: Your trading plan must
spell out how much you plan on allocating to a single position.
(cid:2) How much you risk of your overall portfolio: You determine how much
of your total portfolio is at risk on a single position. Generally, this figure
should be 0.5 to 2 percent (see Chapter 10).

Chapter 1: Swing Trading from A to Z
(cid:2) How to achieve proper diversification: Diversification means more than
adding several securities. You need to have exposure to different asset
classes, sectors, and market capitalizations.
(cid:2) How you combine long and short positions: Combining long and short
positions enables your portfolio to benefit in up and down markets.
(cid:2) How you implement the 7 percent rule: How much you risk on a single
position is different from how much you risk of your total portfolio. The
7 percent rule caps your total risk at 7 percent.
(cid:2) How you determine your exit points: Your exits should be driven by
support and resistance ranges, technical indicators, and profit targets.
(cid:2) What triggers an exit: An exit may occur due to a loss, a profit, or a lack
of meaningful market action.
(cid:2) How you manage your emotions: No matter how effective a risk man-
agement system is, it ultimately must be enacted by a human being.
Thus, this last point is paramount, because humans are affected by
emotions, experiences, and hopes. This fact can cause a swing trader to
abandon the stringent rules he or she has fashioned and may have been
following for years.
I’ve found that managing emotions is the most difficult aspect of swing
trading. The better you get at trading, the more likely your emotions
will convince you to cut corners and abandon the rules that got you to
where you are. But emotions can be managed. You can limit their impact
by, for example, implementing stop loss orders that get you out of a
security without your interference.
The preceding bullets all boil down to two categories of action: position
sizing and limiting losses at the portfolio level. So what’s the difference
between the two? Alexander Elder, a trading expert, once differentiated
between losses suffered at the individual stock level and the portfolio level
through an analogy of sharks and fish. Specifically, he said that position
sizing is done to reduce the risk that your portfolio will suffer a “shark bite”
loss from a single position. That is, a single major loss that wipes out your
account value.
On the other hand, portfolio risk management is done to prevent several
small losses from killing you — or as he described it, death by piranha bites.
A single small piranha may not be able to kill a larger mammal, but dozens of
piranha working together can be deadly.
Similarly, a small loss is not life threatening for a portfolio. The risk is that
several small losses may gang up and cause major loss. That’s why you must
limit losses on an individual stock level (and avoid those shark bites) while
also limiting losses on the portfolio level (to prevent death by piranha bites).

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
Building Your Swing Trading Prowess
Staying on top of your game means you can never stop learning or improving
yourself. Sadly, you can’t simply become a swing trading extraordinaire and
implement your trades with nary a single problem. Heck, a master martial
artist doesn’t stop after earning his or her black belt — why would a swing
trader?
The following action items will help you stay strong throughout your swing
trading career:
(cid:2) Admit to losses when they occur. Markets have a way of humbling even
the most skilled traders if they let their egos get in the way of their trad-
ing. Some traders hold onto losing positions in the hopes that they can
eventually break even — a policy that devastates an account in the long
run. A losing position not only may lose more money but it also ties up
capital that could be invested in more promising trading opportunities.
(cid:2) Be a student of the markets. Successful swing traders never stop
absorbing information. The markets are always changing, with new
investment vehicles appearing and new laws being introduced. As a
swing trader, you must maintain intellectual curiosity. Reading books is
one way to continually stay informed. Take an interest in understanding
your positions and reading the pro and con arguments on them.
(cid:2) Try to insulate yourself as much as possible from others’ opinions,
whether the person is an Average Joe or a Wall Street analyst.
Remember, Wall Street is a community, and analysts send out their
opinion reports to hundreds, if not thousands, of traders and portfolio
managers. Reading those reports can lead you to think like the analyst
does — and like hundreds of others do. Good performance doesn’t come
by copying what everyone else is doing.
(cid:2) Don’t frequent message boards. Message boards often foster a group
mentality that a position should behave a certain way. You don’t want
to gather knowledge from just anyone on the Internet. Rather, stick to
trusted sources and form your own opinion on matters.

s a soon-to-be swing trader, how do you uncover promising opportuni-
ties? And after you uncover those opportunities, how do you time your
entries and exits? Very good questions, and I’m glad you asked.
Like all traders, swing traders rely primarily on two main strategies: techni-
cal analysis and fundamental analysis. The difference between swing traders
and all the rest of ’em, though, is that most swing traders rely on one form of
analysis at the exclusion of the other; the majority of swing traders use tech-
nical analysis either solely or in conjunction with fundamental analysis.
I encourage you to use both strategies. After all, understanding why stocks
move and which ones are likely to move can be just as important as knowing
which stocks are moving. After spending years trading and managing money,
I believe a swing trader should be well rounded in his or her approach.
Strategy and Style: The
Swing Trader’s Bio
Technical analysis deals with charting and technical indicators. Fundamental
analysis is principally concerned with earnings, corporate events (takeovers,
acquisitions, and so on), and valuation. Some swing traders are discretionary —
they use technical and/or fundamental analysis to evaluate each potential trade
and make decisions based on the rules they’ve outlined for themselves. Other

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
swing traders are mechanical — they use either or both forms of analysis and
make trades using an automated system (they rely on a computer to execute
their strategies).
This chapter introduces you to both strategies (technical and fundamental
analysis) and both styles of trading (discretionary and mechanical). Only you
can determine what kind of trader you want to be based on your interests
and expertise.
Two forms of analysis, head to head
Devoid of calculations, reading, or other time-intensive research, technical
analysis allows a swing trader to examine any security — be it stock, com-
modity, currency, or something else — and make a decision on its likely
short-term direction. The swing trader relying on technical analysis doesn’t
care about what a company does, how it makes its money, or whether the
CEO is embezzling funds — he or she cares for nothing but the ticker tape.
After all, swing traders earn profits based on a security’s price, not how many
widgets a company sells or the academic pedigree of its board of directors.
Technical analysis is particularly important for swing traders with a very short
time horizon (that is, a couple of days). The shorter your time horizon, the
more prominently technical analysis should figure in your trading plan.
The swing trader who relies on fundamental analysis is a different breed.
This trader wants to know what line of business a company is in, whether
that industry is on the rocks or gaining momentum, when a company reports
its earnings, and what those earnings expectations are. The swing trader
using fundamental analysis isn’t interested in every detail of a company’s bal-
ance sheet. After all, if you’re looking at trading stocks of ten companies in
the coming week, you don’t have the time to read those companies’ annual
reports cover to cover. Instead, a high-level overview is enough. Intricate
modeling in Excel, though useful, isn’t practical for a swing trader who buys
and sells stocks over a period of days.
Newcomers to swing trading are typically attracted to technical analysis, for
a couple reasons:
(cid:2) Technical analysis doesn’t require nearly as much work as fundamen-
tal analysis. A fundamental analyst has more variables to deal with and
more calculations to compute. To analyze a firm, a fundamental analyst
must understand the dynamics of the firm’s industry, its competitors, its
cost structure, its management team, and other factors.
(cid:2) Trading decisions based on fundamental analysis takes more time to
play out than those based on technical analysis. A company may be
deeply undervalued relative to the market and its industry, but being
undervalued doesn’t necessarily mean shares will rise tomorrow or the

Chapter 2: Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies
day after. Some companies’ shares stay undervalued for weeks, months,
or even years. That’s why long-term investors rely so heavily on funda-
mental analysis — they can afford to be patient.
(cid:2) Technical analysis, because it relies more on charts and indicators,
involves less subjectivity than fundamental analysis. A fundamental
analyst can have all relevant information and still come to the wrong
conclusion.
Despite the major advantages of technical analysis, my goal is to convince
you to use both strategies in your swing trading plan — you tend to get the
best investment results when a security’s fundamentals line up perfectly with
the technicals. Neither fundamental analysis nor technical analysis is perfect,
and neither is superior to the other. In fact, many top swing traders use fun-
damental analysis to trade short term. Why? Because as a swing trader, you
need to understand what drives price movements in the securities you trade.
Fundamental analysis helps you understand how news impacts the market
and the shares you’re trading. After all, what drives oil stocks higher is quite
different from what drives technology stocks higher. Moves out of such secu-
rities can be powerful and longer lasting than securities that pop or fall due
solely to technical considerations.
You can integrate technical analysis and fundamental analysis without much
difficulty, but don’t integrate them for the sake of integration. If you feel more
comfortable with one type of analysis (likely technical analysis), then use that
method. If you’re attracted to using fundamental analysis to the exclusion of
technical analysis, then excel at it. You can be a successful swing trader by
using one type of analysis alone — as long as you use a strict risk management
system (see Chapter 10).
Scope approach: Top down or bottom up?
Regardless of which approach you take, you should also think about whether
you want to be a top-down swing trader or a bottom-up swing trader (I don’t
recommend using both approaches in this case). A top-down trader finds
securities by beginning at a macro level and drilling down to an industry and
then to a particular company. A bottom-up trader finds securities by begin-
ning at the bottom (that is, with individual companies) and then selecting the
company that has the best industry group and macro-level fundamentals.
Recognizing that you can use technical analysis or fundamental analysis
with the top-down or bottom-up approach is important. For example, you
can select undervalued securities using fundamental screens (a bottom-up
approach, as explained in Chapter 8) and then vet those securities for strong
or weak chart patterns. Alternatively, you can identify strong or weak stocks
using industry chart patterns (a top-down approach, covered in Chapter 8)
and then investigate those securities to find the candidates that are most com-
pelling to buy or short.

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
Styles of trading: Discretionary
versus mechanical
Discretionary swing traders evaluate potential trades based on their trading
plan. They use either fundamental or technical analysis to determine whether
each trade meets their requirements. Although the discretionary trader’s
rules are written down, he or she may pass on or take trades based on expe-
rience or gut. The discretionary swing trader doesn’t follow a program such
as, “If A, then B.” Instead, he or she synthesizes all available info, weighs
items, and then makes a call.
Mechanical swing traders are much different. They map out trading strate-
gies that a computer can execute. The mechanical system can be based on
technical inputs (like price, indicators, and so on) or fundamental ones (such
as earnings surprises, sales growth rates, and other corporate events). The
strategies are programmed into a computer software program that tests
them on historical market data. The mechanical swing trader analyzes those
results to determine whether the strategy is worth pursuing — if it produces
higher profits than the overall market, for example.
As you may’ve guessed, the two approaches both have advantages and
disadvantages:
(cid:2) Discretionary trading allows for a fresh look at each situation and the
ability to pass on trades when external data that may not be easily cap-
tured in a computer program indicates decreased chances of success.
However, because the discretionary trader must make a decision on
each buy or sell, he or she is more prone to falling in love with trades,
becoming emotionally attached, or failing to follow the trading plan.
(cid:2) Mechanical trading largely takes the human out of the equation. A com-
puter program, barring some kind of catastrophe, executes the trades
as programmed. The only input on the swing trader’s part is the amount
of capital devoted to each position, the entry signals, and the exit rules.
After those factors are determined, the mechanical trader can step back
and watch the computer work its magic. But mechanical trading systems
also have their drawbacks. Can a system be designed to capture all con-
tingencies or possibilities that may arise? Of course not. And when losses
occur, the mechanical swing trader must determine whether the setback
is a temporary part of the system or whether it represents a fundamental
failure of the strategy.
This text is geared toward discretionary traders. Although hard data on the
proportion of swing traders who are discretionary or mechanical is hard to
come by, my experience and anecdotal evidence point to discretionary trad-
ing as the more common approach. After all, some things, such as recognizing
chart patterns, can’t be easily programmed into a computer. And most swing
traders feel more in control when they evaluate each trade instead of relying
on a computer to execute transactions.

Chapter 2: Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies
Wrapping Your Mind around
Technical Theory
Technical analysis is the art of reading a security price chart with volume and
determining the security’s likely direction based on the strength of buyers
and sellers. Technical analysis can range from the simple (interpreting a chart
pattern) to the complex (performing intermarket analysis and interpreting
indicators based on differential equations). Basic chart interpretation is an
important skill, but swing traders typically rely on indicators and intermarket
analysis.
The technical analyst is principally concerned with the following questions:
(cid:2) Is this security in a bull or bear market in the short and long term?
(cid:2) Is the security trending or in a trading range?
(cid:2) Who’s in control of the market — buyers or sellers?
(cid:2) Is the strength of the buyers/sellers increasing or waning?
(cid:2) What price point indicates a reversal or failure?
(cid:2) What signals the time to enter?
(cid:2) What signals the time to exit?
Understanding how and why
technical analysis works
So why does technical analysis work? How can examining past price history
possibly provide insight into future price movements?
(cid:2) Market participants, acting alone, react similarly to major news.
Technical analysis is partly based on the psychology of crowds. Even
though all investors may not be congregated in a single room, they’re
all human. Hence, they’re susceptible to the same emotions all humans
share: greed, fear, hope, and the like. Security prices would be very dif-
ficult to analyze if everyone trading were Spock-like — perfectly logical
with no emotions getting in the way.
(cid:2) Market participants have memory. Traders, investors, and other
market participants have reference points when they buy or sell securi-
ties. The price they pay when they buy a security affects when they’re
likely to sell that security (even though it should have no bearing on
that decision). They remember their purchase price and, naturally, want
to either make a profit or break even. If the security price swoons after

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
they purchase shares, they’re likely to feel pain. And if the price recov-
ers to their original purchase price, many will be happy to sell to break
even. What these traders and investors often don’t realize is that hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of others are experiencing these same emotions.
This fact is why certain price levels are more significant than others.
Securities tend to find support (a level at which security prices stop fall-
ing and begin to rise) and resistance (a level at which security prices
stop rising and begin to fall) at round numbers.
I’m amazed at how often traders place buy limit or sell limit orders at
round price figures. Don’t they realize that many other traders may be
doing the exact same thing, and that their actions may prevent the price
from ever reaching that level? Quite simply, a sell limit of $100 isn’t too
bright, because other traders or investors likely placed orders at that
same round number. And their orders may prevent yours from ever get-
ting executed (the overwhelming supply of shares at that level will force
the stock to retreat before reaching $100). On the other hand, a sell limit
of $98.71 is smart, because it’s unlikely that other traders placed an
order at that specific price, and you have a much better chance of your
order getting executed.
(cid:2) Smart investors’ actions show up on the chart. Smart money often
refers to investment money made by institutional investors who buy
or sell securities based on sound, reasoned analysis. These investors
have the resources to call the suppliers and customers of firms they
invest in and can determine with a high degree of confidence whether a
company’s earnings are on- or off-track. Smart money also constitutes
insiders at a firm who have an information advantage over other market
participants and may trade on that information.
Dumb money, on the other hand, refers to investment money made by
amateurs who buy or sell securities for the thrill of investment. Dumb
money can include retirement plans or corporate plans that divest
securities that no longer meet the plans’ criteria. This selling pressure
pushes prices down for no good reason. Dumb money can also include
institutional investors who buy or sell stocks because they fall in love
with their investments. Believe it or not, institutional investors are sub-
ject to the same whims and emotional swings experienced by all traders.
(cid:2) Folks with knowledge of a company’s prospects can only take advan-
tage of that knowledge by trading on the open market. Their trading
shows up on the ticker tape (it’s the law). So if you know that Microsoft
is going to have a blowout quarter (by legal means, of course, and not
through insider knowledge), you can’t profit from that knowledge except
by buying shares. And your buying is going to show up as volume on a
price chart. Others who may not know about the blowout quarter can,
nonetheless, infer that something is up when they see Microsoft’s shares
rising on heavy volume.

Chapter 2: Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies
Sizing up the technical advantages
and disadvantages
Because the price chart shows all available public and private information,
technical analysis can really shine bright when prices diverge from their fun-
damentals. Opportunity is greatest when you’re in the minority, but right. If
everyone, including you, expects shares of Coca-Cola to do well, you won’t
make much money because everybody else has already come to the same
conclusion as you. However, if you think something is terribly wrong at a com-
pany and everyone else is on the other side, you stand to make a large profit if
you’re right and the crowd has to correct its collective opinion by selling stock.
For example, shares of Enron were tumbling in late 2000 despite what
appeared to be stellar fundamentals. Price drops were met by upgrades and
buy recommendations by Wall Street analysts who, using all available public
data, determined that shares represented a major value.
But prices kept falling. A swing trader using technical analysis would con-
clude that something wasn’t right. If everything was peachy, why were shares
falling? Something must be up. And sure enough, something was up — some-
thing mischievous indeed. Investors using fundamental analysis, on the other
hand, are often alerted of underlying cracks in a company’s financial position
after it’s too late.
Despite the advantage technical analysis has of signaling information that you
may not know, this strategy isn’t a cure-all for your trading woes. Reading a
chart involves a degree of interpretation, and sometimes whipsaws or indica-
tions can give you one signal, only to reverse a short while later. Moreover,
a major event can occur that no one knows about. For these reasons, you’ll
never know with certainty that a particular chart pattern or indicator will yield
a profitable signal. Swing traders (indeed, all traders) have to learn to live with
this uncertainty, which also exists in fundamental analysis (or any analysis
technique, for that matter). Some swing traders are actually wrong the major-
ity of the time, but still extremely successful. Why? Because the many losers
are small, whereas the few winners are huge.
Some of the major advantages of technical analysis are that it
(cid:2) Applies consistently across time and markets

Chapter 2: Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies
The two main aspects of technical analysis
This book covers the two major aspects of technical analysis: charting and
using technical indicators. Reading charts and using indicators are of equal
importance to the swing trader who uses technical analysis, so you should be
adept at both. (Keep in mind that technical indicators are largely unhelpful if
you don’t understand basic chart pattern interpretation.)
Reading charts
Charting, which I cover in Chapter 4, is the analysis of securities based on
patterns, which security prices trace, as well as volume. The appeal of stock
charts for many is their ease of use. Even fundamentals-based investors who
don’t believe in or use technical analysis bring up a stock chart before buying
a new position just to see where the security has been recently. Managers
with no background in charting whatsoever still use it to some extent. As a
swing trader, you can use dozens of chart types, including line charts, bar
charts, and candlestick charts.
In this book, I break the discussion of patterns in two, though I cover both
topics in the same chapter:
(cid:2) Popular chart patterns: The patterns you’ll find most useful in your
swing trading, like head-and-shoulders and cup-and-handle formations,
may show up whether you’re using a line, bar, or candlestick chart.
(cid:2) Candlestick-specific chart patterns: These chart patterns, like morning
and evening stars and bearish engulfing patterns, are easily detected
when using candlestick charts
Using technical indicators
A technical indicator is like a compass: It helps steer you in the right direc-
tion. The act of using technical indicators, which I cover in Chapter 5, is a
two-step process:
1. Apply technical indicators to security prices.
Technical indicators are mathematical formulas that, when applied to
security prices, clearly flash either buy or sell signals. They largely
remove subjectivity from the analysis of chart patterns. Technical indi-
cators primarily fall into two categories: trending and non-trending.
• Trending indicators are designed to look for significant changes
in direction and allow you to ride through noise (unimportant
changes in security prices) that may happen over the course of
a few days. They measure the strength of these trends and signal
reversals, so you should apply trending indicators to securities
that are consistently rising or falling.

==================================================

34
Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
• Non-trending indicators measure the strength of buyers and sellers
where changes in direction occur frequently. They often standard-
ize recent price history — say, by establishing the high and low
prices during the period — and measure the security’s relative
position within that standardized range. Non-trending indicators
also generate overbought and oversold signals. Overbought simply
means the security has risen too high and is due for a course cor-
rection, and oversold means the security has fallen too low and is
due for a reversal. You should apply non-trending indicators to
securities that oscillate between two price levels, when the market
participants largely agree on the security’s value and the swings
between the two price extremes.
Not all indicators tell you whether a security is in trending mode or non-
trending mode, but relying on the ones that do is useful. Not all indica-
tors are appropriate at a single point in time. Technical indicators are
subject to user inputs. These questions partly explain why no indicator
is always going to give the correct signal. Many swing traders seek out
the Holy Grail indicator or system that yields the correct signals every
time, but no such indicator exists. You must rely on your understanding
of the security in question and apply indicators judiciously.
2. Analyze the strength of the security relative to the overall market.
Relative strength analysis involves comparing the performance of a secu-
rity to an overall market or industry by looking for divergences between
the price of the security and the overall market, which you can see after
applying technical indicators. A divergence occurs when a security’s
price moves to new highs or new lows, and the technical indicator
doesn’t confirm that strength or weakness. The indicator is signaling
that the security price isn’t telling the whole story. Divergences are
powerful signals because they communicate information contrary to the
perceived trend.
Appreciating the Value of the Big
Picture: Fundamental Theory
If you start to sweat when you hear the phrase fundamental analysis and get
anxious when you consider all the tough work that goes into analyzing a com-
pany, don’t worry. I follow the K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid) approach when
it comes to fundamental analysis.

firm’s fundamentals that have the biggest impact on share prices.
The fundamental analyst is constantly asking the following questions:
(cid:2) What is this company’s value relative to its peers?
(cid:2) What is this company’s growth rate?
(cid:2) What are this company’s returns on capital and debt levels?
When you find the answers to these questions, you begin to get an idea of
what price the company’s shares should reasonably trade at. You’re not
going to arrive at the intrinsic values that Wall Street analysts slave over
calculating (intrinsic value refers to the true value of a company and is distin-
guished from market value, which is the value the market is currently assign-
ing to the firm). But you don’t need to know the value of the shares you trade
down to the cent. If shares are valued at $15, and you know shares should be
between $25 and $32, do you really need to spend dozens of hours calculat-
ing the exact figure? Nope.
Understanding how and why
fundamental analysis works
Understanding how fundamental analysis works is a bit easier than under-
standing how technical analysis works. Here’s why this strategy is effective:
(cid:2) The higher the earnings of a company, the more others will pay for
a piece of that company. If you own a condo that produces $1,000 in
income each month, how much would you value that cash flow? Different
people would value the condo differently, depending on their risk toler-
ance levels and the certainty of that cash flow continuing. But obviously, if
the condo were producing income of $2,000 per month, it would be worth
double what it was worth when it was producing $1,000 per month.
Fundamental analysis isn’t that different, except that instead of produc-
ing rental income of $1,000 per month, companies produce earnings and
report them quarterly. Of course, shareholders don’t usually receive a
firm’s entire income because much of it is reinvested in the business.
But the point is, fundamental analysis works because it measures a com-
pany’s value based on its expected future earnings.

(cid:2) Arbitrageurs keep prices in check. Another important reason funda-
mental analysis works is that arbitrageurs are looking for riskless prof-
its. For example, suppose a security is trading at $25 per share, and the
company is valued at $1 billion. If the firm had $2 billion in cash on its
books and no debt, an arbitrageur would step in to take advantage of the
mispricing. The arbitrageur could buy the company for $1 billion and
then pay for the purchase using the cash the company has on its books.
So fundamental analysis works because firms, governments, and indi-
viduals are constantly looking for riskless profits.
Okay, you’re convinced that fundamental analysis has merit, but can you
benefit from it in your swing trading? The answer is yes. But you should be
aware of its limitations and how you can address them:
(cid:2) Unlike technical analysis, you can’t uniformly apply fundamental
analysis to securities. A swing trader who understands how to interpret
chart patterns and technical indicators goes through the same process
whether he or she is trading corn, cotton, gold, oil, stocks, exchange
traded funds, or mutual funds. The chart analysis is the same, and resis-
tance and support both apply because market participants behave in
similar ways regardless of what they’re trading.
Master the fundamental analysis of cotton, however, and you aren’t
much better off when you come to trading oil. Master the fundamen-
tal analysis of telecom shares, and you’ll face a new ballgame when it
comes to banks. Differences persist between market fundamentals and
how you analyze them. For this reason, swing traders who rely on funda-
mental analysis often must specialize in one or two markets.
(cid:2) Fundamentals change less often than chart prices. A company reports
its earnings and sales figures once every three months. Swing trading
based on a report that’s two months old can be hazardous because
whatever value the report contained was likely incorporated in the
company’s price during the first few days after the report was released.
This fact doesn’t mean you should ignore news of a company that isn’t
recent. But it does mean that you don’t want to buy a security based on
a news report issued two months ago that sales are raging. The reason
for the purchase has to be a recent catalyst or the convergence of good
technicals (a chart) and good fundamentals.
Surveying the fundamental advantages
and disadvantages
Fundamental analysis has its pluses and minuses. Some aspects, such as its
emphasis on industry dynamics and competition, make it well suited for the
swing trader; other aspects, such as its focus on value realization over the
long term, make it a poor swing trading tool.

I don’t recommend exiting based on a company’s fundamentals. All too often,
a security’s shares make their move before the reasons for that move are fully
known. As a swing trader, you’re better off basing exits on the strength or
weakness in the price chart (depending on whether you’re short or long the
security). Stock prices fall faster than they rise, and commodities tend to rise
faster than they fall. If you’re long stocks, you want to exit quickly because
of this characteristic. Fundamentals change too slowly to react in a timely
manner on an exit. Use stop loss orders in any case to protect your downside.
Looking at catalysts and the
great growth/value divide
Fundamental analysis is principally concerned with a company’s value (or
perhaps more accurately, what a company’s value appears to be). But even
a company that is undervalued may stay undervalued unless some catalyst
occurs to cause other investors to revalue shares higher.

Chapter 2: Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies
Watching for catalysts
To help make up for the main weakness of fundamental analysis — the issue
of timing — swing traders rely on catalysts. Catalysts are fundamental events
like mergers, acquisitions, new products, and earnings release dates that
affect short-term price movement and spur the market to correctly value
a company’s shares. They can be internal or external, and you should pay
attention to both.
(cid:2) Internal catalysts: Events that a company has direct control over are
internal catalysts. They come in the form of new services or products
(consider the splash that Apple’s iPhone made when it debuted) or new
management (a change in the CEO position at Hewlett-Packard helped
propel shares higher).
(cid:2) External catalysts: External catalysts include such events as consolidation
in an industry (when a company is bought out, its competitors are often
assigned higher valuations because they’re seen as potential targets) or
changes in commodity prices (for example, oil or natural gas prices).
As a swing trader, you should look for opportunities to trade when a firm’s
fundamentals change because of one of these events — or when the percep-
tion of a firm’s fundamentals changes (such as when a company surprises Wall
Street with its earnings report). Consider a real-life example: Homebuilders’
shares were overvalued for much of 2005. If you shorted shares of some of the
top homebuilders then, you would’ve had your head handed to you. But if you
used fundamental analysis, you may’ve waited for a catalyst — an event that
would cause repricing of homebuilder shares. That event came in August 2005
when, for the first time in many months, the growth rate of contracts for new
homes slowed. (Security prices of fast-growing firms often peak when growth
rates begin to decline, not when growth turns negative.)
Classifying a company according to growth or value
Fundamental analysts usually classify companies as either growth firms
or value firms (though many ardent investors argue that growth and value
investing are two sides of the same coin). Even though growth investing and
value investing are associated with long-term investing, swing traders need to
be aware of the differences, because growth stocks and value stocks outper-
form each other at different times.
(cid:2) Growth stocks: Companies that typically trade at premiums to the over-
all market (as defined by price to book ratios or price to earnings ratios)
are growth stocks. They tend to be in industries that experience high
growth rates, like technology and healthcare.
(cid:2) Value stocks: Companies that typically trade at discounts to the overall
market (as defined by price to book ratios or price to earnings ratios)
are value stocks. They tend to be in the financial sector and the con-
sumer staples sector (for example, companies in the beverage or food
industries are considered to be part of the consumer staples industry).

Part I: Getting into the Swing of Things
During some years, value is in the lead; during other years, growth is out
front. Trading growth stocks when value is in favor, or vice versa, can be like
fighting a schoolyard bully with one hand tied behind your back. If you’re a
great fighter, you can pull it off. But it’s not easy.
The reason that value and growth stocks exchange leadership roles lies in
investor perception. At times, investors favor companies that pay dividends
(such as when the Bush administration cut taxes on dividend payments) or
companies that have steady cash flow streams. Value stocks shine during
these periods. Other times, investors favor strong earnings growth without as
much regard to price. Growth stocks shine at these times.
Is it enough to simply know which horse is in the lead? After all, if you could pre-
dict with reasonable accuracy whether growth or value would lead, you could
rely on your forecasting abilities rather than historical performance — which, as
I’m sure you’re well aware, isn’t a guarantee of future returns. Forecasting, how-
ever, has a problem.
Even if you’re right about which style of investing should be in the lead based
on all known evidence, that doesn’t mean that style will actually lead. In other
words, the market isn’t rational.
I remember meeting with investment consultants in 2005 who quizzed me on
whether value stocks would outperform growth stocks in the coming year.
In truth, I had no idea. I knew that it was growth’s turn to lead because value
had been in the driver’s seat for several years, and the valuations were com-
pelling on the growth side of the divide. But the market doesn’t always agree
with my analysis. The only reliable way I know to trade the growth/value
divide is by using technical analysis.
Long-term investors care little about who’s in the lead because they can afford
to wait for the time when their style is in favor and their stocks reflect that
value. Fortunately, as a swing trader, you don’t have to analyze the economic
situation and determine what lies ahead for growth and value stocks. Rather,
you can simply analyze recent history and bet with the trend. If matters
change, move your chips to the other side of the table.

(cid:1) Tracking your trades with a trading journal
(cid:1) Staying positive to achieve positive results
S
wing traders use brokers like any other market participant. But a swing
trader needs a different kind of broker than an investor or day trader.
What type of broker you choose depends on a number of factors. I break
down those factors in this chapter, and I also give you details on how to open
a brokerage account.
After you have your account up and running, you need to think about subscrib-
ing to certain services to help carry out your analysis. Some services are help-
ful for conducting screens of the market. Other services chart securities. Still
other services help you locate the cream of the crop by focusing on industry
group rotation. I recommend some key services in the pages that follow.
I also cover trading journals in this chapter. To be a keen swing trader, I
recommend that you keep a journal (not to be confused with a personal
diary) of your trades because a journal helps you refine your tactics and
improve your trading by allowing you to review what works and what
doesn’t.
This chapter assumes you have a working knowledge of the financial markets.
You should also know how to use the Internet so you can try out some of the
brokerage options and service providers that I mention.

Hooking Up with a Broker
Why is the firm that executes all your trades called a broker? Not exactly an
enticing name, is it?
Despite the name, brokers are necessary for swing trading — or any kind of
trading, for that matter. But not all brokers are created equal. Some specialize
in offering custom advice and wealth-management services for the high net
worth individuals out there. They charge outrageous fees to execute trades
because, well, they can. Of course, they’d argue that those outrageous fees
simply reflect the cost of their advice.
Swing traders don’t use such plush services. Their brokers have more of a
no-frills approach. But the nice thing about competition is that even the no-
frills brokers are increasingly offering premium services like check-writing
privileges and ATM card access to brokerage accounts.
So how do you pick a broker who suits your needs? Read on.
Choosing a broker
When choosing a broker, traders all too often focus on a single factor —
commissions — to the exclusion of everything else. Commissions get the
limelight because they used to be the main impediment to frequent trading.
Not too long ago, swing trading wasn’t possible for the masses due to high
commissions. By law, brokers charged fixed trade commissions. But on May
1, 1975 (it’s okay if you forget this date after three seconds), securities laws in
the United States changed, allowing brokers to charge negotiated trade com-
missions. Commissions didn’t immediately fall to the levels they’re at today,
but they did fall over time. Today, you may pay a flat $5 to $12 per trade,
which may be equal to about a penny or less per share, depending on how
many shares you trade.
But not all brokers offer such competitive rates, nor do they all provide
the same services, so you must carefully consider the factors that are most
important to you when settling on a broker. Some of those factors include the
broker’s charting system, customer service, the ease of placing orders, and
the ease of depositing and withdrawing money.
Understanding the different types of brokers
What broker you choose depends on which services you want and how much
you’re willing to spend on commissions. Here are two classes of brokers to
consider:

Chapter 3: Get ting Started with Administrative Tasks
(cid:2) Discount brokers: Discount brokers offer fewer services to their clients
than full service brokers do. Instead, they focus on trade execution. You
tell them what to buy and sell, and they do it. Of course, trades are usu-
ally made electronically today instead of over the phone. You can always
speak to a living human being on the phone, but that will cost you more
for your trade. Discount brokers may provide some services for free, such
as research services or banking services.
(cid:2) Direct access firms: Direct access firms allow you to bypass a broker
and trade with an exchange or market maker directly. The advantage to
this approach is that you have more control because you can see who’s
offering or bidding for shares of a security and choose with whom you
want to trade. Direct access brokers often require you to download soft-
ware to your computer that provides faster streaming data than you’d
receive through a Web site. Some discount brokers are beginning to
offer direct access trading.
You may also encounter full service brokers, such as Merrill Lynch, who hold
their clients’ hands, offer a suite of services, and charge enormous commis-
sions. Obviously, full service brokers aren’t the choice of swing traders. A
swing trader who needs someone else’s advice on what to trade shouldn’t be
in the business of swing trading. Swing trading is about independence, not
dependence.
Searching for broker prospects
As a swing trader, you must use either a discount broker or a direct access
firm (see the preceding section for details on both). I’m not going to recommend
a particular broker for the simple reason that broker rankings change over time,
and a broker that provides great service today may not necessarily provide such
service in the future.
The major discount brokers you may want to consider include:
(cid:2) TD Ameritrade (www.tdameritrade.com)
(cid:2) E*Trade Financial (www.etrade.com)
(cid:2) Scottrade (www.scottrade.com)
(cid:2) Fidelity Active Trader (www.fidelity.com)

Par t I: Get ting into the Swing of Things
Evaluating a potential broker
You need to consider a number of factors before choosing a broker:
(cid:2) Commission rate: Don’t pay more than a $10 flat fee, or more than one
to two cents per share for your trades. Trading with commission rates
higher than this amount isn’t necessary given what you can get from exist-
ing brokers. And, more important, the higher the commission rate, the
higher your returns have to be to cover the cost of those commissions.
Although I recommend specific rates in the preceding paragraph, trad-
ers tend to put too much emphasis on the commission rate and some-
times neglect other details when choosing a broker. Don’t fall into that
trap. The commission rate is important, but it’s not the sole factor you
should consider.
(cid:2) Trading other asset classes: A broker’s ability to offer you other markets
is becoming increasingly important. Ask your broker whether he or she
can arrange for you to trade international securities, futures contracts,
currencies, and so on. Expect to pay a premium for these additional
trading options.
(cid:2) Banking services: Some discount brokers offer banking services
like check-writing from your brokerage account or an ATM card that
accesses your portfolio. Most brokers allow electronic transfer of assets
so you can send and receive money from another bank account. These
types of services may or may not be important to you.
(cid:2) Usability: Usability refers to how user-friendly a broker’s trading inter-
face is. Some brokers allow swing traders to execute orders through
their Web sites; others require traders to download software onto their
computers. This factor can really only be addressed by taking a test
drive of a broker’s trading platform (be it a Web site or trading soft-
ware). Is it easy to enter orders? Is it easy to watch the market (if you
rely on your broker for market data)? I can tell you from experience that
TradeStation and TD Ameritrade have easy-to-use interfaces, but I recom-
mend you try out the brokerage options as you’re weighing this point
(some brokers allow you to use demo versions of their trading software
before opening an account).
(cid:2) Amenities: Amenities include research services and charting programs.
For example, a discount broker may offer you Level II quotes — which
enable you to see the order book for Nasdaq stocks; see Chapter 11 for
the scoop on using Level II quotes — or stock reports from Wall Street
firms for free or for a discounted fee. But I strongly discourage you from
relying on research reports. Besides the fact that almost everyone on
Wall Street sees them before you do, research reports aren’t very useful
because they’re rarely focused on short-term trading opportunities.
(cid:2) Customer service: You want to know that you can get someone on the
phone — and fast — when you have a trade or problem. How responsive
a company is to your complaints is next to impossible to determine

Chapter 3: Get ting Started with Administrative Tasks
without opening an account — unless you use media rankings. I recom-
mend relying in part on such rankings because they can be instruc-
tive — the writers share their experiences with a broker’s customer
service and other issues. Barron’s and Technical Analysis of Stocks &
Commodities are two publications that print broker rankings.
(cid:2) Portfolio analysis and reports: How much has your portfolio returned
year-to-date versus some major index? You can calculate this total on
your own (see Chapter 13), but it’s nice to have a broker who can run
the report for you. And when tax time comes, a broker with extensive
tax services can be a lifesaver.
Opening an account
After you’ve settled on a broker, you need to decide what kind of account you
want to open. You have several options, depending on whether you plan to
(cid:2) Borrow money to trade from your broker
(cid:2) Trade futures or options
(cid:2) Place the account in your name alone or in the name of your spouse as well
(cid:2) Designate the account as a retirement account or traditional brokerage
account
The next two sections help you answer these questions (save the spouse
question . . . that’s a discussion you need to have with your significant other —
sorry, I’m not that great at relationship advice).
Cash account versus margin account
After selecting your broker, you need to choose between opening a cash account
and opening a margin account. Cash accounts restrict your investable assets to
the cash available in your account. Margin accounts allow you to borrow money
from your broker to execute trades; they’re also necessary if you want to trade
options. A swing trader with $50,000 in cash sitting in a margin account can
usually borrow $50,000 to trade.
Borrowing is a double-edged sword: It magnifies potential returns but also
magnifies potential losses. If you borrow 100 percent of your assets and
invest the entire amount (for example, you deposit $50,000 into your broker-
age account and trade $100,000 in securities), a 10 percent loss is magnified
to a 20 percent loss. Not pretty.
Margin accounts can cause you to be more reckless in your trades. Money that’s
not yours (but that you have trading discretion over) is easier to gamble with
than money that is yours. Margin accounts may lead you to get in over your
head. If you’re new to swing trading, stick to a cash account — trading only with
your own assets is less potentially damaging to your overall portfolio.

Traditional brokerage accounts versus retirement accounts
Another question to ask yourself is whether you want to open a traditional
brokerage account or a retirement account. Traditional brokerage accounts
offer you easy access to your money. However, you must report your profits
on these accounts to the IRS as taxable income, unless the IRS classifies you
as a full-time trader, in which case you can convert capital gains and losses
into ordinary gains and losses. Why is that important? Because you can
deduct ordinary gains and losses against other income. If you’re not classi-
fied as a full-time trader, the maximum amount of losses that you can deduct
annually from pre-tax income is $3,000 (as of the date of this writing).
A retirement account, of course, solves the problem of taxes because it’s a
tax-deferred account. Unfortunately, the government limits how much you
can contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in a single year
($5,000 in 2008 if you’re age 49 or younger). The government also limits when
you can withdraw the money without penalties (usually in the year you turn
59 1⁄
2
). So swing trading in a tax-deferred account is preferable if you want to
avoid the taxes that result from high turnover, but it isn’t preferable if you
plan to live off your profits.
Selecting Service Providers
No man (or woman) is an island, and no swing trader can trade without service
providers. But not all service providers are created equal. (Okay, okay . . . enough
with the clichés!)
Service providers differ in terms of the quality, timeliness, and breadth of the
data they supply, among other items. What you want in a provider is some
type of service — charting or access to a database of fundamental data, for
instance — that you can use for your benefit. In the following pages, I tell you
what to look for and what to avoid.
Providers to do business with
Data providers simply provide you with the tools for finding and charting secu-
rities and increasing your market intelligence. These tools should be flexible
enough to allow you to change inputs, such as what indicators to use for a chart
or what criteria to screen for in a database. I classify service providers broadly
into those that supply technical data and those that supply fundamental data.

Chapter 3: Get ting Started with Administrative Tasks
Technical software providers
Every swing trader must have a strong charting system. That charting system
must incorporate real-time charting and quotes (charts and quotes that reflect
live market data and aren’t delayed) if you plan on trading intraday. If you enter
orders after the markets close, you don’t need a real-time charting service.
The marketplace has many charting providers. Most discount brokers cater-
ing to the active trader club offer charting systems, and order entry is often
integrated with the charting functions (that is, you can program automatic
buys or sells when a certain action occurs in the chart).
Some of the popular charting programs in the marketplace include:
(cid:2) TradeStation (www.tradestation.com; the charts used in this book
are primarily taken from TradeStation)
(cid:2) MetaStock (www.equis.com)
(cid:2) Active Trader Pro (www.fidelity.com)
(cid:2) eSignal (www.esignal.com)
(cid:2) E*Trade Pro (www.etrade.com)
(cid:2) High Growth Stock Investor (www.highgrowthstock.com)
Several of these charting systems are integrated with brokers to allow for
easy order entry.
Which charting system is right for you depends on your needs. For example,
if you like to develop new indicators, you need a charting system with that
option. You must also consider the system’s ease of use and whether the
charts are appealing. A charting system should also have a wide array of indica-
tors that you can plot (the most popular indicators are covered in Chapter 5).
You should read independent reviews of charting systems to assist you in
your selection if you don’t already use a charting program regularly. I rec-
ommend reviewing the rankings published by Technical Analysis of Stocks &
Commodities in its annual Reader’s Choice Awards.
I use two charting systems: the one provided by my broker and another one
in which I conduct much of my own research.
Fundamental analysis software providers
Swing traders who opt to use fundamental analysis in their investment process
need to subscribe to data providers that can assist them in their research.
Fortunately, much of the fundamental data on a company —historical earnings,
returns on capital, expected growth, and the like — is available for free on
the Internet. I’m amazed at how much data is free for the taking online (am I
dating myself?).

Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, and Reuters can address many of your fun-
damental data needs. And all three services provide fundamental data for
free. Following are a few more details on all three services:
(cid:2) Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com): I often begin my fundamental
data search at Yahoo! Finance. The Web site offers basic charting; head-
lines on a selected security; a company profile; competitor information;
analysts’ estimates (and historical earnings surprises); and financial
data from a company’s balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow
statement. But beware: Yahoo! Finance also has message boards that
you should avoid.
(cid:2) Google Finance (finance.google.com): Google is a newcomer to
the financial data distribution business. Google doesn’t provide as many
financial data fields as Yahoo! Finance, but it offers more data on inter-
national firms. I visit Google often when Yahoo! Finance doesn’t have
the data I’m looking for. Google calls its message boards “Discussions,”
which sounds harmless enough — but not everything is what it seems.
(cid:2) Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance/stocks): Yahoo! Finance and
Google simply present data taken from other providers, but Reuters
supplies its own data. The main data categories are Stock Overview,
Financial Highlights, Ratios, Estimates, Officers & Directors, Financial
Statements, Recommendations, and Analyst Research. My favorite
category is Ratios, shown in Figure 3-1. At a glance, Reuters provides
data on a company versus its peers and the overall market, so you can
quickly discern whether a company is priced at a premium or discount,
and whether that price is justified based on other ratios, like return on
equity or expected earnings growth rates.
In addition to these free research services, a few paid subscriptions are
worth your money:
(cid:2) Investor’s Business Daily: This daily newspaper provides fundamental
data on thousands of stocks. Each security is assigned an earnings rank
number and other fundamental data rankings.
(cid:2) High Growth Stock Investor: This software program, also known
as HGS Investor, provides top-down and bottom-up data services,
combining fundamental and technical data. The software is ideal for
fundamentals-based traders who screen sectors or the overall market
for trading candidates.
(cid:2) Zacks Investor Software: Yahoo! Finance, MSN, and Morningstar —
among others — offer stock screening services, but I consider Zacks
the leader in the business. Many of Zacks’s screening tools are available
online for free at www.zacks.com/screening/custom. Certain data
fields are available only to subscribers, but you can build effective
screens without a subscription. However, if you want to backtest a screen
to see how it would’ve performed historically, you must subscribe to
Zacks Research Wizard service.

Par t I: Get ting into the Swing of Things
Providers to avoid
If a service provider is charging exorbitant fees for its services, beware. You
can usually purchase top-quality charting programs for a small monthly fee,
and sometimes you can get them for free from your broker (assuming you
trade often enough with that broker). You can select stocks with software that
costs $600 per month, so be wary of high-priced services.
In general, avoid any type of service that tries to do the work for you. For
example, a service provider may tell you that ABC is overvalued or XYZ is
undervalued. Or it may tell you when to buy and when to sell. But think about
it: If that service really was exceptional at predicting when to buy and sell,
wouldn’t the providers of that service use it for their own profit? Why sell the
service? If I developed some model that accurately forecasted when to buy
and sell securities, I sure wouldn’t sell it to others!
Two types of specific services you should never consult are message boards
and newsletters or software programs that issue specific buy or sell recom-
mendations. Both of these services effectively delegate some thinking on
the part of the swing trader to someone else. But these services are popular
enough that I spend the rest of this section going into more detail.
Message boards: The kiss of death
If you find yourself browsing a message board, you may as well wear a
sign on your back that reads, “I’m lost.” My advice: Avoid message boards
because they won’t give you good intelligence and are likely to mislead you.
Here’s why:
(cid:2) The information on message boards isn’t objective. Generally, the sen-
timent on message boards is bullish. The majority of people posting are
excited about a company’s prospects and rave about how the widget
the company makes will revolutionize the world. Some people list their
target prices and how they recently picked up “another” $10,000 worth
of said stock. I’m sure they wouldn’t deceive us. (For an example of this
sometimes irrationally bullish outlook, see Figure 3-2.)
(cid:2) You can’t distinguish between competent and incompetent participants.
No credentials are required to post on the board except a pulse.
Although message boards do have intelligent posters mixed in with
masses of people who have too much time on their hands, you simply
can’t read them in the hopes of getting the opinions of the one or two
people who actually know what they’re talking about.
(cid:2) They’re annoying. You’ll get profanity (dressed up in numbers, of
course, to get by the Web site’s technical censors) and messages that
show that some posters are apparently unaware that a keyboard’s caps
lock can be turned OFF.

Newsletters and software programs that issue buy/sell
recommendations: The not-so-harmless pack leaders
Many intelligent market experts out there write financial newsletters.
Newsletters tend to be of a higher caliber than message boards. Whereas
message boards are free to post to, newsletter writers depend on subscrib-
ers to continue their service. Hence, it’s tougher to make up things when you
may lose business as a result.
What I have a problem with are newsletters that recommend you buy or sell
this or that stock. As a swing trader, you must be independent. You aren’t
supposed to rely on anyone else’s expertise. Newsletters that stick to the
macro picture or industry group analysis are fine. You learn by reading those
newsletters.
But don’t think for a second that you have an edge in the market if you’re simply
replicating the buys and sells that a newsletter recommends. Even when the
newsletter has a good track record, you shouldn’t follow the recommendations
blindly. You’d be better off giving your money to a professional manager.
One software tool I suggest you shy away from is VectorVest. The service allows
you to type in most any publicly traded company and be told what the fun-
damental and technical picture looks like. It even tells you whether to buy or
sell that security. How wonderful. You don’t even need to think. VectorVest is
a quantitative model. It combines quantitative and qualitative factors to deter-
mine whether a security is a buy or sell. But what’s important is that it’s not
your model — it’s someone else’s. And anyone who subscribes to that service
is going to get the same recommendations as you would if you were to sub-
scribe. So how can you stay ahead of the pack when you’re running with it?
Starting a Trading Journal
Any system needs some type of feedback loop to improve itself. For example,
employees of most companies must complete annual performance reviews,
when their boss sits them down and tells them what they’ve done well (some-
thing? anything?) and what they can improve on.
Your progress as a swing trader is no different. A feedback loop is crucial so
you can make adjustments and improvements. Insanity was once defined as
doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome each
time. If you trade securities without a feedback loop, I view that as a type of
insanity.
Your feedback loop should take the form of a trading journal in which you
record all your trades. The journal entries should be short and combine text

that outlines the basics of the trade (like how you found it and what triggered
the entry) and charts that show what you saw before entering the trade
(which help you spot the readings of technical indicators, where resistance
and support levels were, and so on).
After a position closes (meaning you exit for a profit or loss), you can return
to the journal entry to discover what you did right or wrong. You may be
surprised at what you uncover. You may find that you should let profits ride
longer, for example, or take losses faster. Or you may realize that the nine-
day moving average isn’t such a great tool for signaling the beginning of an
uptrend.
Look for commonalities between your winners and losers after you’ve kept
your journal for a few months. If you’re like me, you may learn more from
your losses than you do from your gains. When you suffer a large loss, it can
be helpful to know whether the problem was due to the system itself or your
failure to follow the system. Then, if warranted, you can alter your trading
plan to improve the odds of success.
Your trading journal should include the following elements:
(cid:2) An explanation of how you found each trading opportunity
(cid:2) The positions you trade and whether they’re long or short
(cid:2) A chart of each security with any relevant indicators to assist in analyzing
the conditions of the market at the time you executed the trade
(cid:2) A miscellaneous section to record any additional information that may
be relevant at time of entry, such as concerns you had about executing
the position
(cid:2) A description of what triggered the entry
(cid:2) A post-mortem chart of the security with an explanation of what trig-
gered the exit
(cid:2) A rate of return after your exit
A trading journal can, of course, include a lot more information than what I’ve
presented here. For example, I don’t include certain items in a journal entry,
such as position size, that you can easily obtain from your broker. You can also
plot the industry group of the security, if applicable, or a chart of the overall
market. But the problem I’ve found with including too much information is that
you may fail to update the journal in a timely manner.
You must strike a balance between including too little information — to the
point where the journal isn’t useful — and including too much information —
to the point where the journal becomes a daunting task you fail to maintain. I
believe that if you use the criteria I list, you can achieve that balance. I provide
examples of trading journal entries in Figures 3-3 and 3-4.

Creating a Winning Mindset
The final element you need to get started is a winning mindset. When I first
heard this rule of thumb, I thought it was too touchy-feely. But experience
and research studies have shown that there’s something to it. Fitness experts
often focus on a person’s mindset because they know that beliefs are trans-
lated into action. When your mind believes something, it works to make that
belief a reality.
Bill Phillips, in his book Body for Life, recounts an intriguing story about
beliefs and goal-setting. He refers to a Harvard University study that showed
that only 3 percent of the students graduating in 1953 actually wrote down
their specific career goals. Twenty years later, the study’s researchers inter-
viewed the class of 1953 and discovered that those 3 percent who had writ-
ten down their goals were worth more than the other 97 percent combined.
Successful swing traders believe they’ll succeed. They don’t dwell on their
past failures but on their past successes. They write down their goals and
their trades. They view losses as a normal part of the business of swing trad-
ing. They don’t become arrogant and overconfident when their trades gener-
ate large profits.
It helps to set specific goals, like “I will return 15 percent this year.” Write
down your goal and read it often. Yes, I know it sounds corny, but I’ve seen
this advice time and time again in investment books, physical fitness books,
and other places. And I’ve seen it work.
So begin swing trading with a winning mindset. Know that you’re going to achieve
your goals. Be optimistic. Take losses in stride and stay as unemotional as
you can. You’ll find that a winning mindset helps you become a successful
swing trader.

A
picture’s worth a thousand words, or so I’ve heard. The stock chart
is, perhaps, the best proof of this old cliché. For centuries, charts have
assisted traders in profiting from buying and selling an underlying contract.
Candlestick charting, for example, was developed by the Japanese in the
1700s to profit from changes in the price of rice.
Over time, investors became more sophisticated in understanding charts and
the information contained within them. In fact, they became so much more
sophisticated that they started identifying certain chart patterns and giving
them funny names. Would you believe that head and shoulders is more than
just a shampoo brand, or that cup and handle applies to finances and not
just your favorite coffee container? Sure, these patterns may be the result
of investors and traders staring too long at charts. After all, I sometimes see
funny formations in clouds if I stare long enough. But they are useful tools for
your swing trading ventures.
In this chapter, I share how you can predict the likely direction of a security —
be it sideways, upward, or downward — by understanding the basic cycle of
securities and the specific roles price and volume play in what you see on a
chart. I also introduce you to several charting patterns every swing trader
needs for success. The patterns are presented in order of complexity, so
go ahead and skip straight to what you need based on your familiarity with
charting. All set? Then chart away, my friend!

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Nailing Down the Concepts: The Roles
of Price and Volume in Charting
All charts come down to basically two inputs: price and volume. The major-
ity of this chapter focuses on price, because patterns within price are more
meaningful than patterns within volume. You’re rewarded or punished for
being right on price, not volume. But I don’t want to gloss over volume. It’s a
major tool in your swing trading kit and is worth close examination.
Volume communicates conviction on the part of buyers or sellers:
(cid:2) A price rise on light volume may signal an absence of sellers, not the
presence of buyers.
(cid:2) Heavy volume, on the other hand, signals that bulls or bears are
committed to the calling.
Look to buy securities on heavy volume (exiting’s a different matter). If you’re
swing trading trends — regardless of the chart pattern you observe — insist
on seeing heavy volume. But what is heavy volume? My general rule of thumb
is that volume 1.5 times the average daily volume over the past 50 days is con-
sidered heavy. (Yahoo! Finance and most charting programs report average
daily volume statistics.) Volume can also help you determine when to exit. A
decline on heavy volume, for example, may signal that the security has farther
to fall. If you’re swing trading ranges, you want to see light volume, which indi-
cates a lack of interest by bulls and bears.
An old saying on Wall Street notes that amateurs trade at the open and pro-
fessionals trade at the close. If a security closes higher than it opened, it rep-
resents a victory of sorts for the bulls. They were able to overwhelm sellers
during the day. On the other hand, if a security closes lower than it opened,
that represents a win for the bears, who were able to overwhelm buyers
during the day. If a security closes at the same price it opened at, bulls and
bears are at a stalemate.
Major institutions that control billions of dollars are in the markets day in and day
out. They account for the majority of volume on exchanges. Security prices move
when institutions allocate parts of their portfolios to one security or another. So
you want to read how they’re investing their dollars and ride the inevitable wave
that follows as more institutions get into the bathtub. One investment wizard
I learned from — Ian Woodward — explained volume in these terms: An insti-
tution getting into a security is like an elephant getting into a tub of water.
You know the water’s going to overflow. Similarly, volume overflows when
institutions buy into or sell out of a security.

Chapter 4: Char ting the Market
Having Fun with Pictures: The
Four Main Chart Types
Reading a chart isn’t difficult, but there are different ways of viewing the same
price information, be it a line chart, candlestick chart, or bar chart. Most swing
traders choose one chart type and stick to it. The most popular chart type for
swing traders is the candlestick chart, because it reveals the most information.
To get the most value out of charting for your swing trading ventures, you
first need to be able to recognize the four main types of charts in the finance
world and how each can help you — or harm you if you’re not careful.
Following are the four main chart types and a brief description of each (from
the most common and basic to the least common):
(cid:2) Line chart: This chart type simply connects closes from one period to
another, and the resulting chart resembles a line. Television news programs
often show line charts because of their simplicity. However, critical data
is missing. A line chart doesn’t show you where a security opened for
the day — only where it closed. Nor does it plot the highs and lows that
occurred for each period. Line charts do, however, allow you to focus on
the most critical piece of information: the day’s closing price.
(cid:2) Bar chart: You’re likely familiar with traditional bar charts, which show the
open, high, low, and close of a specific security. The bar chart addresses
many of the shortcomings found in the line chart. Often called an OHLC
bar chart (which stands for, you guessed it, open-high-low-close), this chart
can provide hourly, daily, weekly, or even monthly information. Figure 4-1
shows a representation of a standard bar. A horizontal line protruding from
the left of the bar signals the security’s opening price, and a horizontal line
protruding from the right side of the bar signals the security’s closing price.
The period’s highs and lows are the top and bottom of the bar.
(cid:2) Candlestick chart: This chart type clearly depicts a security price’s open,
high, low, and close. Traditional bar charts do the same, but candlestick
charts do it more effectively. Candlestick charts are made up of two com-
ponents: the range between the open and close (called the real body)
and price movement above and below the body (called shadows). If the
security closes higher than its open during that period (a bullish sign), the
body is usually white. If the security closes lower than its open during the
period (a bearish sign), the body is usually black (Note: Different charting
programs use different colors to shade in the body.) When prices open
and close at the same level, the candlestick body is reduced to a horizon-
tal line, and the remaining parts are the upper and lower shadows. Figure
4-1 shows what typical candlesticks look like.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Candlesticks are a great way to examine charts, and you can use these
patterns to assist you when entering and exiting securities. However, I
don’t know any swing traders who rely on candlestick patterns exclu-
sively. So avoid putting all your eggs in the candlestick basket. Like
every technical tool, the candlestick is an imperfect instrument. Look
for candlestick patterns as confirmation of a trend or reversal, but avoid
looking to trade a security primarily because of a candlestick chart
pattern.
(cid:2) Point and figure (P&F) charts: P&F charts plot security prices using a
column of Xs (to represent rising price movements) and Os (to repre-
sent falling price movements). The major advantage of P&F charts is
that they filter out noise or unimportant price movement by plotting
only new Xs and Os when the price of a security moves by a predefined
amount. One downside is that they don’t reflect the passage of time well.
Because new plots are made only when the price exceeds the predeter-
mined threshold, a plot may not be made for days or even weeks if the
security in question doesn’t move significantly.
The three charts in Figure 4-2 contrast a line chart, bar chart, and candlestick
chart. All three charts cover price action for Google (symbol: GOOG) between
December 10, 2007 and February 6, 2008. The bottom chart demonstrates a
rising trendline, which highlights a support area that, when broken, signals
the end of the uptrend. Figure 4-3 shows the other main chart type: P&F.
This book focuses on bar charts and candlestick charts, primarily the latter.
Both chart types reveal intraday or intraweek (depending on the time period
set) strength of bulls and bears, making them favored tools of swing traders
far and wide. Support or resistance areas are also occasionally easier to see
with bar charts or candlestick charts.

Charts in Action: A Pictorial View
of the Security Cycle of Life
Securities go through a naturally occurring cycle, but not all securities follow
this cycle religiously. If you can’t characterize which stage a security is in,
you’re better off skipping it and finding one that’s following the normal cycle
of accumulation, expansion, distribution, and contraction. Understanding
this cycle is helpful, because different phases require different strategies.
Swing trading trends, for example, is best achieved during the expansion and
contraction phases. Trading ranges, on the other hand, is best achieved in
accumulation and distribution phases.
The waiting game: Accumulation
The accumulation phase is typically the longest phase a security goes through.
During this period, its price neither rises nor declines meaningfully. Instead,
its price moves sideways through time. Supply and demand are roughly in bal-
ance, and institutional managers or smart money often accumulate shares of
an undervalued security. (Smart money is typically institutional dollars that are
informed by extensive research.)
Volume is usually light, reflecting a general consensus that the security’s price
is correct. Buyers are unable to push prices higher than a ceiling (a resistance
level), whereas sellers are unable to push prices below a floor (a support level).
You can’t know in advance with any precision where these ceilings or floors

Chapter 4: Char ting the Market
will be found. You can easily identify them, however, by viewing a price chart
and looking for price levels that a security is unable to climb above or fall
below. These support and resistance areas are usually driven by fundamental
reasons. For example, Microsoft’s stock may not be able to rise above $35
per share because that movement represents a valuation of $300 billion, and
market participants may not feel the company is worth more than $300 bil-
lion. Thus, support and resistance levels vary by security and can’t be deter-
mined until you examine a price chart.
Think of an accumulation phase as a period where most market participants
agree on a security’s value. Because price isn’t moving dramatically, profiting
off of securities in the accumulation phase can be difficult. Some swing trad-
ers may buy at or near the support level and attempt to sell at the resistance
level. This approach only works, of course, when the distance between the
support and resistance level is sufficiently wide enough to make the profit
worthwhile. It also only works as long as the security continues to trade in the
range. If you swing trade trends, you want to look for securities moving out of
the accumulation phase and into the expansion phase. However, if you swing
trade ranges, you may be content to find accumulation phases and trade them
until the security ends its accumulation phase.
You can spot accumulation phases on charts of varying time periods. Although
accumulation phases are traditionally thought of as occurring over several
months, a security can technically be accumulated over a few days. The key
factor is time frame. A day trader, for example, looks at intraday charts where
each plot represents a five- or ten-minute interval. For day traders, accumula-
tion phases may occur over a two-day period.
As a swing trader, you shouldn’t be so close to the bushes. Although you can
use intraday charts occasionally to perfect your timing of buys and sells, your
default chart period should be measured in days. In these types of charts, an
accumulation phase must last several weeks — if not months — to be consid-
ered a true accumulation phase. Otherwise, you may be dealing with some
other phase of the cycle of the security.
Figure 4-4 highlights a typical accumulation phase when shares of Apache
Corporation (symbol: APA) oscillated between two price levels — $75 and
$60 — between October 2005 and April 2006. This wide trading range allowed
swing traders to buy at support level and sell at resistance level for profits.
However, the accumulation phase wasn’t perfect. In October 2005, shares
rose above the resistance level by a hair for a few days. And then in June
2006, shares fell below the support level of $60 by a hair.

You can’t be strict on exact price levels of support and resistance and assume
a security’s price will immediately stop falling near a support level or imme-
diately stop rising near a resistance level. For example, if a security’s support
level is $35 and its resistance level is $40, you can’t assume the security’s
price will immediately stop falling when it hits $35. It may stop falling at $35.20,
$34.90, $34.75, $35.50 — well, you get the idea. Sometimes share prices don’t
reach either extreme and make turns within the two bands. Swing traders sell
long positions or enter short positions near resistance levels.
The big bang: Expansion
The expansion phase, also known as the markup phase, follows the accumula-
tion phase (see the preceding section) and is a period of increasing prices. If
the movement out of the accumulation phase is truly an expansion period, the
security’s price doesn’t reenter accumulation. So if you swing trade trends, this
is the phase where you want to go long — as soon as possible.
This phase marks the beginning of a change in perception among sharehold-
ers and outside investors. A stock expansion may occur as the earnings
outlook for a company improves. In the case of companies with a highly suc-
cessful product (think Apple and the iPod), shares may begin to rise steadily
out of an accumulation pattern after that product’s launch.
The expansion phase is ripe with profit opportunities. Swing traders who buy
right as the expansion phase gets underway often can ride a strong trend for
several days or weeks. The beauty of buying as an expansion gets underway is
that the proverbial line in the sand is clearly marked. That is, you know rather
quickly whether you bought at the right time based on whether the security’s
price reenters the accumulation phase. If you buy late, then you risk a large

loss if shares of the security rapidly fall to the breakout price level — or worse —
fall back into the previous accumulation range. Use the money management
strategies outlined in Chapter 10 if you’re in this boat.
Look for strong volume at the beginning of the expansion phase as confirma-
tion that it’s genuine. If a security emerges from an accumulation phase on
weak volume, that may indicate a lack of conviction on the part of buyers.
Hence, the rally may be short-lived. For a refresher on the role of price and
volume, flip back to the earlier section, “Nailing Down the Concepts: The Roles
of Price and Volume in Charting.”
For a real-life example of what the expansion phase looks like, check out Figure 4-5,
which reflects the expansion of Apache Corporation (symbol: APA). Notice how
the breakout from the accumulation phase is on heavy volume, as highlighted
in the volume subgraph, and that shares returned to the resistance level estab-
lished in the accumulation phase. If prices had broken below that level, that’d
indicate the expansion breakout had failed. Instead, shares returned to the
breakout level and found support. This move is seen as a low-risk entry level.
Yet not all breakouts give you such a beautiful gift. Strong breakouts often don’t
return to the accumulation phase and allow reentry.

The aftermath: Distribution
All good things must come to an end, including high-flying securities. During
the distribution phase, the good news that propelled shares during the expan-
sion phase is no longer so surprising to Wall Street. Share prices start to even
out and move sideways instead of rising or falling. Think of the distribution
phase as the end of the party. The music is bland, the food is stale, and the
conversations are getting old. That’s the distribution phase in a nutshell.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
The folks who built up shares of a security in the accumulation phase unload
those shares during the distribution phase. Amateur investors are often
buying the security in the distribution phase, having found out about the
company or the investment from a front cover on Forbes. When everyone
knows the story, it usually means the story doesn’t have much farther to run.
The distribution phase can resemble the accumulation phase, a misinterpreta-
tion that can seriously mess with your swing trading. Confusing the two may
prove costly when you’re expecting a higher breakout rather than a lower one.
Shares move sideways during the distribution phase, seemingly indicating a
consensus on a security’s price, and volume tends to taper off. You can tell
accumulation from distribution by
(cid:2) Observing that a markup phase precedes distribution, whereas a mark-
down phase usually precedes accumulation
(cid:2) Looking at the security’s fundamentals — typically they aren’t as strong
during accumulation
Companies can sometimes give you a hint that their shares are priced too
high. If you see one offering new stock to the public via a secondary offering,
you can be sure that management thinks shares are trading at a premium to
their true value. Also, you may see a stock split during the distribution phase.
As a swing trader, identifying distribution phases is helpful for knowing when
to exit long positions (sell securities you own) and enter short positions
(short securities you anticipate declining in value). If you spot a distribution
phase, exit immediately if you own the position. You’re likely to be stopped
out by one of your sell rules during a distribution phase: a moving average
crossover or the breaking of a predefined support level, for example. You
may also exit based on the passage of time, a strategy I present in Chapter 10.
I don’t recommend shorting during a distribution phase. Because distribution
resembles accumulation, you may short a security that’s only pausing in its
ascent. So don’t short until you see a security’s price exiting the distribution
phase and entering the contraction phase (covered in the following section).
Figure 4-6 highlights shares of Sandisk (symbol: SNDK) during a distribution
period. Notice that volume tapers off as shares move sideways. This distribu-
tion phase followed an expansion phase that occurred in June and July of 2007.

The downfall: Contraction
The fourth and final stage of a security’s price cycle is the contraction, or
markdown, phase that’s best summarized as a period of lower highs and
lower lows, a time when short sellers rule. (For more on the earlier stages,
see the previous three sections.)
Contraction is a dangerous period. Security prices don’t fall in straight lines.
Instead, they fall, and then rally to attract new buyers who believe a bottom
has been hit. Those rallies fail, and the security moves to fresh, new lows.
Avoid timing a bottom in a security. Often termed bottom fishing, buying a
declining security may feel psychologically pleasing because you’re buying
something that was more expensive only a few days or weeks ago. But it’s dan-
gerous because shares can fall off a cliff after being in a contraction phase.
Volume isn’t a helpful indicator in periods of contraction. Although heavy
volume indicates sellers’ conviction, light volume doesn’t indicate the oppo-
site. As the old Wall Street maxim says, “A stock can fall on its own weight,
but it takes volume to rise.” Hence, a contraction period can be met with light
volume throughout.
Securities tend to fall faster than they rise. In just a few days, a security can
give up gains that it made over the last several months because greed influ-
ences price rises and fear influences price declines. Fear’s a more potent
emotion than greed. If traders fear lower prices, they sell — fast. But when
prices are rising, they’re not as committed to buying as quickly as possible.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Rallies in a contraction phase are normal and mark entry points for short sellers.
Each rally ends at a point that’s lower than the previous one. And every decline
takes the security’s price to a new low. The prudent approach is to wait for
clear signs that the contraction phase is complete and that the security’s either
holding in an accumulation phase or entering an expansion phase. Short sellers
should short on the rallies and cover on the declines, a profitable strategy (until
it becomes so obvious that it ends). You want to have the wind at your back
when you buy a security, and buying in a contraction phase means that wind’s
going to hit you full in the face.

This contraction followed the distribution phase highlighted in Figure 4-6. Shares
of Sandisk rallied in late October and late November as the stock broke to fresh,

Popular Patterns for All Chart Types
Highbrow academics in their ivory towers shun chart patterns because spot-
ting a head and shoulders or cup and handle can be subjective. Just like seeing
a pattern in a cloud or the stars, chart patterns are difficult to quantify. To be
proven sound, an academic needs to establish rules on spotting these chart
patterns, but programming a computer to look for patterns is difficult. Yet
reading chart patterns is an essential ability of the successful swing trader.

Chapter 4: Char ting the Market
The solution to the quandary? Trade only patterns that are clear as day. Stick
to the tried-and-true chart patterns and you’ll avoid the pain of trying to see
patterns where none exist.
The following sections describe five major chart patterns: Darvas box, head
and shoulders, cup and handles, triangles, and gaps. Rest assured that other
chart patterns exist, but these five are, in my opinion, the most common and
the most useful. They occur regularly and reflect the psychology of the crowd:
day traders, swing traders, position traders, long-term investors, and the like.
The Darvas box: Accumulation in action
The Darvas box, a rectangle-shaped pattern, illustrates that security prices
tend to trade between two levels before breaching a level and rallying or fall-
ing. You may recognize this pattern as the accumulation phase described in
the earlier section, “The waiting game: Accumulation.”
In a nutshell, the pattern’s creator, Nicholas Darvas, looked for securities
that traded between two clear price levels: a support level and a resistance
level. The support level marked the price point at which buyers stepped in
and bought shares, preventing prices from going down. The resistance level
marked the price point at which sellers stepped in and sold shares, prevent-
ing prices from going up. Darvas didn’t waste time with securities that didn’t
fit nicely into this mold.
After identifying a security as trading between the two price levels, Darvas
waited patiently until the security broke out of the upper band on heavy
volume. Then he’d buy, placing a stop loss below the support level of the
rectangle. If the security rose and formed a new rectangle, he’d raise his stop
loss level to the area below the new support level.
The Darvas box works in reverse, too. A falling security may form Darvas
boxes on its way down, so short sellers do the opposite of buyers. That is,
they identify a security trading between two price levels and then short only
after the security breaks below the support level. They place their stop loss
level right above the old support level. If a new Darvas box forms, they move
the stop loss down to the area above the new resistance level.
Figure 4-8 depicts a typical Darvas box using shares of Philippine Long Distance
(symbol: PHI) traded between two clear price levels: $30.50 and $27.30. The
excitement came on November 2, 2005, when shares broke out convincingly
above $30.50 on heavy volume. This date signaled the beginning of an uptrend
(see the later section, “Uptrend lines: Support for the stubborn bulls,” for more
info on uptrends) and marked the first time shares had exited the Darvas box,
indicating an opportune time to buy. Subsequent Darvas boxes would offer the
trader a chance to raise the stop loss level.

Figure 4-8:

box in 2005.
In a similar scenario, you could’ve placed a stop loss level below the support
level of $27.30. However, I’d recommend placing a stop loss level just under
the resistance range, near $30.50. Remember: If the breakout’s genuine, the
security doesn’t reenter the Darvas box.
If you’re asking yourself why I advise adjusting Darvas’s methods, you should
know that Darvas wasn’t a swing trader. His time horizon was longer than
that of the swing trader’s, and he could afford to wait out a security. As a
swing trader, you don’t have the luxury of waiting out a security’s consolida-
tion period. Hence, the tighter stop loss level I recommend will keep you in
if the breakout is genuine and get you out if the security decides to take its
sweet time.

Head and shoulders: The top-off
Not to be confused with the shampoo, the head-and-shoulders pattern is a
distribution pattern that marks the end of an uptrend, forms for psychologi-
cally based reasons, and is among the most reliable of all chart patterns.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York even published a paper called “Head
and Shoulders: Not Just a Flaky Pattern.” The organization said that the pattern
appeared to have some predictive value and produced profits in certain markets.
The head-and-shoulders pattern is composed of three hills, with the middle
hill being the tallest and the left and right hills roughly the same height. In
this way, the hills resemble a head and shoulders, as you can see in Figure
4-9, which highlights shares of homebuilder Lennar (symbol: LEN).
In January 2007, shares rallied and met resistance at $54 per share. This occur-
rence formed the left shoulder of the head-and-shoulders pattern. Buyers
attempted to raise prices a second time and succeeded, driving Lennar’s stock
north of $56 per share. Sellers stepped in and brought shares back to the same
level as the left shoulder ($52) to complete the head. Finally, buyers attempted
once again to raise prices but were only able to push Lennar’s stock up to the
level established in the left shoulder, a move that completed the right shoulder.
Drawing a trendline through the lows of the left shoulder and the right shoulder
establishes the neckline. (Flip ahead to the last section for tips on drawing trend-
lines.) A head-and-shoulders pattern isn’t complete until a stock breaks below
this point, a movement that’s usually followed by lower prices. The head-and-
shoulders pattern is typically marked by decreasing volume, which shows a lack
of conviction among buyers.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Head-and-shoulders patterns give yardsticks as to how much a security’s
price will fall after breaking the neckline. Simply measure the distance
between the head and the neckline and project that downward to estimate
how far the stock will fall at a minimum. In the case of Lennar, the neckline
was around $52 and the head was around $56. So you could’ve expected the
stock to fall by at least $4 ($56 – $52) from the neckline ($52) and reach $48.
Lennar actually exceeded that estimate.
You should short stocks as they break below the neckline of a head-and-
shoulders pattern. Swing traders who hold shares of a company experiencing
this pattern should only exit on the break of the neckline or the fulfillment of
another selling rule.
An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which marks the end of a downtrend,
literally looks identical to the head-and-shoulders pattern except that it’s
turned on its head (pardon the pun). Figure 4-10 highlights an inverted head-
and-shoulders pattern in shares of Lan Airlines (symbol: LFL). The measuring
technique used in the traditional head-and-shoulders pattern applies to an
inverted pattern as well.
The cup and handle: Your signal
to stick around for coffee
The cup-and-handle pattern is a bullish one that signals shares are being accu-
mulated and the security is preparing for an upward move. Cup-and-handle
formations must be preceded by an uptrend, because they’re a continuation
formation, a pattern that indicates the continuation of a trend. (For tips on
distinguishing among trendlines, flip to the later section, “Measuring the
Strength of Trends with Trendlines.”)

Chapter 4: Char ting the Market
The cup and handle first forms after shares rally to some peak. Then for some
reason — perhaps fundamental or technical in nature — sellers bring shares
down 10 to 20 percent from that peak. Amateur investors who buy near the
peak kick themselves for their mistake and agonize over the 10 to 20 percent
loss on their investments. They think, “After I break even on this dud, I’ll sell.”
As it happens, shares of the security give amateur investors that opportunity
when they rally back to their previous peak. Then those disgruntled share-
holders unload the security en masse, creating a resistance level and leaving
shares unable to surpass that peak. However, shares don’t fall back to their
prior low. Instead, they remain elevated as smart money accumulates shares
at a slight discount. Shares may fall 5 percent or so from the peak at this
point. On the second attempt to surpass the peak, shares break through and
complete the cup-and-handle formation. Volume is key and should rise heav-
ily on the breakout from the handle.
Figure 4-11 illustrates a cup-and-handle pattern in shares of Compania de
Minas Buenaventura (symbol: BVN). Shares of BVN rallied to $45 per share
in July 2007. Then a general decline in the overall market helped send the
shares down to $35, representing a 22 percent loss for shareholders who
bought near the peak. Anxious to recoup their losses, these investors
unloaded their lot when shares of BVN rose near $45 in September and kept
BVN from piercing that level. But the underlying fundamentals of BVN were
strong, and investors on the sidelines didn’t let BVN decline much — only
$5 from the $45 peak. On the second attempt to break through $45, shares
sprinted higher and passed that peak on heavy volume.
My selection of numerous foreign securities in this chapter is to illustrate that
these patterns occur in both domestic and international securities. Moreover,
the greatest opportunities, in my opinion, are in foreign securities.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
The cup-and-handle pattern isn’t as accurate as the head-and-shoulders pattern,
which I describe in the preceding section. I’ve seen it form time and time again
only to fail on the breakout. The key question to ask yourself to avoid being a
victim of a false breakout is, “What is the security’s general market and indus-
try group doing?” The stronger the security’s overall market and industry
group, the more likely the formation won’t fall flat on its face. However, if one
or the other is weak, the pattern may be prone to failure.
Triangles: A fiscal tug of war
Triangle chart patterns (shown in Figure 4-12) provide traders with measure-
ment moves, an estimate of how far the ensuing trend will travel after breaking
out from the triangle. Think of triangles as a reflection of the tug of war that
occurs between buyers and sellers. Sometimes buyers have the upper hand;
other times sellers have it; and occasionally both sides are evenly matched.
To make use of triangle patterns in your swing trading, you need to get familiar
with the three types of triangles and how to calculate price movement with each:
(cid:2) Ascending: Ascending triangles form when buyers maintain a level of
strength while sellers continually weaken, so buyers have the upper hand
here. Graphically, buyers maintaining their strength is reflected in prices
maintaining a certain price level. Each time sellers push prices down,
bulls step in and push shares back. Every decline stops at a higher level
than the previous decline — a sign that bears are unable to push prices
lower. Eventually, buyer strength overwhelms the sellers, and the security
breaks upward. To estimate how far, at a minimum, prices will move after
a breakout occurs, add the height of the triangle to the breakout price
level. The height of the triangle is the vertical distance between its support
and resistance levels.
(cid:2) Descending: Descending triangles represent the opposite of ascending
triangles. Sellers maintain their strength during the formation of the
descending triangle, and buyers continually weaken, thus giving sellers
the upper hand. Graphically, this weakening is depicted as prices falling
to a certain level and subsequent rallies ending at lower peaks. Sellers
maintain their strength during the descending triangle, while buyers are
unable to push prices to or beyond their previous peaks. Eventually,
the buying pressure dries up, and prices break downward. (Think of
descending triangles as an amateur boxer fighting a heavyweight. Try as
he may, the amateur eventually goes down.) Subtract the height of the
triangle from the breakout price level to estimate price movement after
a breakout.

==================================================

77
Chapter 4: Char ting the Market
(cid:2) Symmetrical: Symmetrical triangles represent a stalemate; buyers and
sellers are evenly matched. Each rally ends at a lower peak than the
previous rally, whereas each decline ends at a higher trough than the
previous decline. You can’t easily tell who’s going to win, but you can
generally expect prices to continue in the same direction as the trend
prior to the formation of the symmetrical triangle. To estimate price
movement in this case, add or subtract the triangle’s height from the
breakout level, depending on which way prices break.
With any triangle chart pattern, be sure to watch for volume on the actual
breakout to distinguish between false breakouts and true ones.
Ascending and descending triangles are the easiest triangles to trade because
you don’t encounter ambiguity on the likely direction of the breakout. Stick to
these patterns and skip symmetrical triangles.

Gaps: Your swing trading crystal ball
Gaps occur frequently in prices; they represent a break in price continuity.
For example, a security may be trading in the $19 to $20 range and then gap
up to $25. Gaps may represent a seismic shift in the fundamentals of a security,
or they may mean nothing. In this section I cover the four types of gaps.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Common gaps
I hate to tell you this, but a common gap is meaningless. Prices gap up or down
one day but quickly “fill the gap” in a matter of days. This phrase is a simpler
way of saying the security’s price returns to the area where the gap exists. If a
security trades at $50 for several days and gaps higher to $52 the next day, its
price fills the gap by trading back down to $50. Figure 4-13 shows two common
gaps occurring in late 2006 in a chart of Diana Shipping (symbol: DSX).
Don’t trade common gaps. They typically have light volume and don’t repre-
sent conviction on the part of buyers or sellers.
Breakaway gaps
A breakaway gap occurs on heavy volume and indicates seismic shifts are
occurring in the security. Often the percentage move up or down is signifi-
cant (more than 5 percent in a single day), and the volume is at least double
the average daily volume. Breakaway gaps are preceded by congestion peri-
ods. A security’s price trades for several weeks or months in a certain price
area and then violently gaps higher or lower one day. The strength of the
move indicates a major change is occurring in the way investors value the
security. Figure 4-14 highlights a breakaway gap using shares of Contango Oil
& Gas Company (symbol: MCF).
Breakaway gaps don’t necessarily require swing traders to immediately buy
or sell, because several things can happen after the gap, and the gap has to
be confirmed. So if you think you see a breakaway gap, take note, but wait for
confirmation.

Continuation gaps
A continuation gap crops up in the midst of an uptrend or downtrend and
signals — you guessed it — the continuation of the previous trend. Figure 4-15
highlights a continuation gap that followed a breakaway gap in shares of
Flowserve Corp. (symbol: FLS). Note: Not all continuation gaps are preceded
by a breakaway gap.
Some swing traders actually estimate how far a security will rise or fall based
on the price appreciation or depreciation from the beginning of a trend until
the continuation gap, and then project that forward. This approach can be
somewhat subjective. Instead, look to add or enter a position on a continua-
tion gap in the direction of the gap (for example, buy if the gap is up and short
if the gap is down). Place a protective stop loss within the gap. If the gap is
truly a continuation gap, shares don’t return to fill it.

Exhaustion gaps
An exhaustion gap, which occurs in the direction of a trend, resembles a
continuation gap and marks the end of that trend. If a security has been fall-
ing for several weeks and then gaps down, you may think that gap is a con-
tinuation gap. However, if the gap fills quickly, it’s likely an exhaustion gap.
Figure 4-16 offers an example of an exhaustion gap occurring at the end of an
uptrend in shares of Sigma Designs (symbol: SIGM).
The exhaustion gap doesn’t offer any call to action for you as a swing trader.

Letting Special Candlestick Patterns
Reveal Trend Changes
You can find dozens of candlestick chart patterns out there, but I cover
only the ones I feel are most accurate. The next four sections feature candle-
stick chart patterns that are easy to identify and that may signal a change in
momentum or a continuation of a trend. (For help discerning one trend from
another, flip ahead to “Measuring the Strength of Trends with Trendlines,”
later in this chapter.)
Hammer time!
A hammer represents the bottom of a trend. It looks identical to a hanging
man (see the following section) and occurs at the end of a downtrend.

==================================================

81
Chapter 4: Char ting the Market
Hammers have small real bodies in the upper portion of the candlestick bar.
They have long lower shadows and small upper shadows (if any). Hammers
signal that after the price of the security opened on the market, sellers drove
it down. By the end of the day, buyers had recouped much of the losses to
end the day near or at the high.
I like to see hammers that extend below recent price action. If a hammer
occurs within the price action of previous days, I don’t consider it a reliable
indicator of a bottom.
Figure 4-17 sheds some light on the difference between a hammer that forms
below recent price history and one that forms within price history using
shares of Western Digital (symbol: WDC), which bottomed on April 10, 2007.
Notice how the high and low on that bottoming day were well below recent
price history. Contrast this hammer formation to the apparent hammer that
formed on March 14, 2007. This second hammer’s body was within previous
price action, but ultimately, it didn’t mark the bottom of the downtrend.
No hammer is complete without confirmation. If the price action directly after
the hammer is down, then no hammer has occurred. A true hammer can’t
have its low violated by subsequent price action. So watch to see how subse-
quent days unfold before trading a hammer so as to avoid whipsaws.
Volume, again, should be kept in mind. Hammers that form on heavy volume
are usually genuine, whereas those that form on light volume probably aren’t
the real McCoy.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
The hanging man (Morbid, I know)
A hanging man looks identical to the hammer (see the preceding section).
However, it occurs at the end of an uptrend rather than a downtrend. It crops
up on heavy volume and is followed by price action confirming the top. If the
high of the hanging man is surpassed, then its signal is invalid.
Double vision: Bullish and bearish
engulfing patterns
My favorite candlestick charting patterns are the bullish and bearish engulf-
ing patterns, which involve two candlestick bars, not one.
Bullish engulfing patterns occur when a candlestick bar opens lower than the
previous candlestick’s close and closes higher than the previous candle-
stick’s open. In candlestick terminology, the pattern begins with a candlestick
bar that has a small real body and is followed by a candlestick bar whose
body engulfs the previous day’s body.
Why is this pattern so bullish? It represents a major defeat, so to speak, for
bears. When the second candlestick bar opens, sellers are already pushing
prices below the prior day’s close. However, buyers step in and begin pur-
chasing en masse. Not only are they able to reverse the direction from the
open but they also manage to push prices higher than where sellers began
the previous day. Think of a bullish engulfing pattern as a surprise victory in
a battle where an infantry division loses not only the gains it made in the pre-
vious day but also much more.
I’ve found bullish engulfing patterns to be accurate (otherwise I wouldn’t be
covering them). Look for subsequent price action to confirm the reversal. If
prices trade below the pattern, you can bet your bottom dollar that the
pattern failed.
Figure 4-18 highlights a bullish engulfing pattern in shares of NewMarket
(symbol: NEU) that fell in mid-2006 from $62 to less than $40. Notice how the
open on June 14, 2006, completely engulfed the entire body of the prior day.
Subsequent price action confirmed the bottom.
Bearish engulfing patterns occur at the end of uptrends and mark important
reversals. They’re characterized by two bar formations. The first candlestick
consists of a small real body. The second candlestick opens higher than the
previous bar’s close and closes lower than the previous bar’s open, thus
engulfing the first candlestick. Figure 4-19 highlights a bearish engulfing pat-
tern that formed in shares of Diamond Offshore (symbol: DO) in late 2007 and
signaled the end of the prior uptrend.

Wait for confirmation before shorting a bearish engulfing chart pattern since
not all bearish engulfing patterns lead to lower prices. If the engulfing pattern
is genuine, prices should decline after the formation and shouldn’t exceed the
high of the bearish engulfing bar.

The triple threat: Morning
and evening stars
Morning and evening stars are reversal chart patterns that consist of three
candlesticks. Morning stars mark the end of a downtrend and the beginning of
an uptrend. Evening stars mark the end of an uptrend and the beginning of a
downtrend.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
A morning star occurs at the end of downtrends, which means that sellers (the
bears) are in force prior to the reversal, and consists of
(cid:2) A long, black-bodied candlestick that pushes the downtrend lower
(cid:2) A second candlestick that gaps lower at the open (but doesn’t necessarily
have to be completely below the first candlestick) and forms a small body
(cid:2) A long, white-bodied candlestick that gaps higher from the second
candlestick and closes near the upper portion of the first candlestick
Conversely, an evening star occurs at the end of uptrends, reflecting the last
gasp of buyers (the bulls), and is made up of
(cid:2) A long, white-bodied candlestick that pushes the uptrend higher
(cid:2) A second candlestick that gaps higher at the open (but doesn’t necessarily
have to be completely above the first candlestick) and forms a small body
(cid:2) A long, black-bodied candlestick that gaps lower from the second
candlestick and closes near the lower portion of the first candlestick
Figure 4-20 is an example of an idealized morning and evening star. Both
patterns reflect the inability of the ruling party, bulls or bears, to consolidate
previous gains. The star (the middle bar) is an exhaustion attempt by buyers
(in the case of an evening star) or sellers (in the case of a morning star) to
push prices definitively higher or lower, respectively. That’s why the second
bar in the morning or evening star formation is small: The day begins with a
gap in the direction of the trend, but the initial enthusiasm dies down. The
third bar shows a swing in momentum as bulls or bears take over.

ing star and

To see one of these star patterns in the context of a chart, take a look at
Figure 4-21, which shows the evening star reversal in action in shares of
China Mobile Limited (symbol: CHL) in February 2007. Notice how the star
(the middle candlestick in the formation) gapped higher than the previous
bar. The third bar represented a resounding defeat for bulls, as bears were
able to push prices to the level of the first candlestick.

Measuring the Strength of
Trends with Trendlines
Quite literally, trendlines connect price points together and form either a hori-
zontal, rising, or falling line. They’re helpful in establishing support and resis-
tance levels. When a trendline breaks, shares may or may not reverse course.
The most you can take away is that the trend in question has ended. A consoli-
dation period (sideways movement) may follow, a continuation of the trend
may arise, or the trend may reverse. All three scenarios are possible.
The stock market isn’t some perfect universe where stocks stop and rally on a
dime. There are gray areas, and trendlines should be drawn through them. Of
course, trendlines aren’t perfect either and may at times intersect with prices.
But if trendlines are valid, these intersections shouldn’t be significant (in how
deeply they intersect) or often (the number of times they intersect with prices.)
Much ink has been spilt on the construction of trendlines, but there’s really
no science to them. So don’t expect one trendline drawn at an angle of 65
degrees to be right and one drawn at 63 degrees to be wrong. The basics of
drawing trendlines can be summarized in three simple rules:
(cid:2) A trendline must touch three different price points to be valid.
Otherwise, you can draw a line pretty much anywhere.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
(cid:2) The more times a trendline’s touched, the stronger the support or
resistance of that line. A break of a trendline that had been tested
several times indicates a serious change in the trend.
(cid:2) The longer the trendline (measured by time), the more meaningful it
is. The staying power of the trend is measured, in part, by how long the
trendline has been in effect.
If you find yourself drawing and redrawing trendlines (on your charting
program, not by hand), then you’re misusing them.
Don’t waste too much time drawing trendlines. Instead, identify support and
resistance levels, which are often horizontal lines. Then look for an uptrend
or downtrend line that you can draw through the lows or highs to establish a
rate of ascent.
In the following sections, I share how to distinguish and use different trendlines.
Uptrend lines: Support for
the stubborn bulls
Uptrend lines connect several lows and form a support area for the bulls —
the bulls’ line in the sand, if you will. They indicate the rate of ascent that
buyers have maintained over a certain period of time. If your charts are
arithmetically scaled, then the rate of ascent is measured in dollars per time
period. If your charts are semi-log or plotted on a log scale, then the rate of
ascent represents a percentage change per time period.
You want to draw your uptrend line through the lows, but don’t take it to an
extreme. If the line intersects prices slightly, that’s okay. Consider Figure 4-22,
which shows an uptrend line of shares of Sandisk (symbol: SNDK). The uptrend
line is drawn through the lows and touches several price points. On an extreme
day in the beginning of August, prices fell below the line but basically remained
above the trendline. Hence, the trendline stayed intact.
Uptrend lines can be good long entry points for your swing trading. Not only
do they offer an entry price but they also offer a clear risk-cutting price. Place
a stop loss right below the trendline so that you exit shares if the trendline
breaks.
Uptrend lines have another important characteristic: These support lines
become resistance lines after being breached. Look again at Figure 4-22. In
mid-August, shares of Sandisk broke below the uptrend line that began in
June. When shares rallied in September, that support line became a resistance
area. After shares rallied to that trendline, they immediately turned around
and began declining.

Downtrend lines: Falling resistance
Downtrend lines connect a series of peaks and represent an area of resis-
tance. Think of them as the line in the sand for the bears. And like uptrend
lines, covered in the preceding section, they’re more meaningful the more
times they’re touched by security prices and the longer they’ve been in
effect. Figure 4-23 depicts a downtrend line that occurred shortly after a
breakaway gap down in shares of Broadcom (symbol: BRCM).
Because a break of a trendline doesn’t necessarily mean the beginning of a
new trend, you shouldn’t buy or short a security because of a trade trendline
break. If you own shares in a stock that’s rising and then suffers a break, sell-
ing may be warranted. However, don’t look to suddenly short because of the
break.

Horizontal lines: Working to
both support and resist
Horizontal trendlines depict a stationary support or resistance level. After
either of these levels is broken, a trend usually develops. Alternatively, the
security may enter a new trading range with horizontal support and resistance
levels.
Some common horizontal trendlines you’ll encounter as you swing trade
are ascending triangles (a horizontal level of resistance) and the Darvas box
(a horizontal trendline of support and a horizontal trendline of resistance).
These patterns are both described in earlier sections of this chapter.

In This Chapter

(cid:1) Understanding how to use indicators to determine your desired ratio of short

S
wing trading used to be far more difficult before the advent of charting
programs — many of them now free and online — that calculate techni-
cal indicators so that you never need to pick up a pencil and figure them out
by hand. In keeping with the technological times, this chapter doesn’t linger
on how to calculate indicators beyond the basic knowledge necessary to ana-
lyze them effectively and understand how price, volume, or both impact their
direction. Instead, it introduces you to the popular indicators you can apply
to your charts — whether you trade trends, ranges, or both.
No indicator can consistently yield profitable results on all securities under
all time frames. That’s why this chapter begins with an explanation of what
technical indicators are based on and when you should use them. This chap-
ter also helps you grasp the power of combining technical indicators and
chart patterns so that you can swing trade successfully.
Even when you know which technical indicators you want to use, you have
to know which inputs to use with which indicator. Throughout this chapter,
I explicitly state what input variables you should use with the indicators I
cover. In most cases, the inputs are the standards most charting programs
use. Some of them, however, are different, because they’re based on what’s
most appropriate for a swing trader.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
All You Need to Know about Analyzing
Indicators Before You Start
Before you dive into the sea of technical indicators, you must remember a
few important things, which I run through in this preliminary section.
You must apply the right type of indicator
Often, traders apply trending indicators haphazardly to all security price
charts. The problem with this approach is that trending indicators always
assume a market is in a trend, and they give false signals when applied to
non-trending markets, which are characterized by oscillation between two
price levels: a support level and a resistance level. The trending indicator
generates false signals because it incorrectly assumes that a price moving to
a support or resistance level indicates the beginning of a new trend (when, in
fact, these movements are simply normal price fluctuations within an estab-
lished range value). Therefore, you shouldn’t apply trending indicators to
markets that oscillate.
Just as trending indicators wreak havoc when applied to non-trending
markets, the reverse also holds true. If you apply a non-trending indica-
tor to a trending market, the indicator continually flashes red lights due to
an extreme overbought or oversold level. Non-trending indicators, unlike
their trending counterparts, assume price stability. The lack of price stabil-
ity means that non-trending indicators always assume mean reversion (the
theory that prices will return to the mean, or average). Mean reversion
doesn’t occur in trending markets.
Figure 5-1 highlights the problems that can arise when you misapply indica-
tors. The figure compares the correct application of a trending indicator (a
moving average) in a trending security and the incorrect application of a
non-trending indicator (stochastic, located at the bottom of the chart) to the
same security. Notice how the moving average keeps the swing trader in for
most of the trade, while the non-trending indicator gives premature sell sig-
nals. During trending markets, non-trending indicators give false signals.
Not all price swings are meaningful
Technical indicators can go haywire, turning that significant price swing into
nothing. Sometimes a price swing on a chart can reflect a data error (which
happens more often than you may think), or your charting software provider
may fail to account for a stock split. Now and then the price swing is due to an
unsubstantiated rumor. That’s why you must intelligently judge all price swings.

Applying a

ing indicator

signals.
Figure 5-2 provides an example of how a data error can throw a technical indica-
tor off the mark. Shares of SPX Corporation (symbol: SPW) showed a wild price
swing on January 22, 2008, when they supposedly opened at $89.50, traded
down to $73.31, and then closed at $95.23. However, the intraday chart shows a
bad tick (an incorrect price) at $73.31. A technical indicator that looks solely at
the closing price wouldn’t be affected by this price error. However, an indica-
tor that incorporates the highs and lows of the day would be affected.

A data error
can cause
indicators to
yield incor-
rect signals.
In this case, the Directional Movement Index, or DMI (see “The compass of indi-
cators: Directional Movement Index (DMI),” later in this chapter, for details on
this indicator) assumes that sellers are in control of shares of SPX Corporation
due to the negative price swing. As the company’s share price rises, the DMI
fails to track this strength due to the data error.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
You have a few options to protect yourself from getting messed up by a data
error:
(cid:2) Rely on an indicator that doesn’t incorporate the data error.
(cid:2) Ignore that security for trading purposes.
(cid:2) Turn to other technical tools, such as chart patterns and candlesticks.
(cid:2) Report the data error to the trading system administrator, who can
usually correct the error in a day or two.
Prices don’t reflect volume, so
you need to account for it
Together, price and volume form an important picture for you as a swing
trader. Any new information that any single person may possess about a
security — be it good or bad — can only be acted upon by buying or selling
shares of a security. That buying and selling is reflected on the ticker tape —
the price and the volume.
Basing an indicator on price alone does make intuitive sense. After all, a secu-
rity’s price is believed to contain all known information. However, volume
explains traders’ commitment, which price can’t do. Light volume can signal
indifference, whereas heavy volume is usually associated with meaningful
moves. Also, a security rising on increasing volume has more staying power
than a security rising on decreasing volume, and an indicator that looks only
at price (that is, the vast majority of indicators) can’t distinguish between the
two movements. That’s why you should have at least one indicator in your
arsenal that incorporates volume.
But even if an indicator does look at price and volume, there’s always the
possibility of an event occurring outside all market participants’ knowledge.
For example, a company’s headquarters may be destroyed due to a hurricane
or fire, an incident no one can predict.
An indicator’s accuracy isn’t
a measure of its value
Indicators, like all trading techniques, aren’t always accurate. Keep an eye out
for whipsaws, when prices move violently and throw indicators off, and be
sure to plan for and incorporate the possibility that an indicator’s signal is a
false positive. The simplest way to protect yourself from inevitable whipsaws
is to have a risk management system that helps you exit early when a particu-
lar trade doesn’t go your way.

Chapter 5: Asking Technical Indicators for Directions
That said, indicators don’t have to be foolproof to be profitable, so accuracy’s
not a good way to judge whether a particular indicator is valuable. An indica-
tor can generate so-called correct results 30 percent of the time and still be
profitable — if the profitable trades far outweigh the losing trades. Consider
the trading system of fictitious Trader Josh. He relies on two technical indica-
tors in his trading system. However, his system’s usually wrong; the trades he
places lose money 70 percent of the time. Is this system worth following?
That question can’t be answered without additional information. Swing trad-
ers who rely on riding strong trends may be wrong more often than they’re
right but still generate sizeable profits. Trader Josh’s trading log (shown
in Figure 5-3) displays his profits, losses, and net gains or losses over the
course of ten trading days in January. During this time, Trader Josh lost
money on seven days. What a lousy trader, right?
Josh’s Trading Log
Beginning Account Value: $100,000
Profit Loss Net Gain/Loss
January 5, 2009 $0 –$400 –$400
January 6, 2009 $300 –$500 –$200
Figure 5-3: January 7, 2009 $3,000 –$200 $2,800
This trading January 9, 2009 $150 –$500 –$350
log shows January 12, 2009 $290 –$350 –$60
profits and January 13, 2009 $3,500 –$250 $3,250
losses over January 15, 2009 $100 –$150 –$50
January 20, 2009 $320 –$450 –$130
the course
January 21, 2009 $350 –$500 –$150
of ten days.
January 22, 2009 $3,200 –$250 $2,950
Total $7,660
Not so fast. Trader Josh made money on three trading days out of the ten.
And those three days made up for all the losses and much more. Trader Josh
actually generated net profits of $7,660 in those ten trading days — a strong
return on a beginning account value of $100,000.
Two to three indicators are enough
Adding an indicator is as simple as clicking your mouse and being dazzled by
the charts of many colors that appear quite easily. This simplicity leads some
swing traders to incorporate five, six, or even more indicators to a single
security. But doing so isn’t wise.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
The more indicators you add to a system, the more likely your system will
fail to generate consistent signals. Rarely do all indicators point in the same
direction, because all indicators are based on price, volume, or both. This
principle doesn’t change, regardless of how many indicators you add to your
system. When you apply five or six technical indicators to a security’s price
chart simultaneously, you amplify the amount of noise (unimportant informa-
tion). Or you wind up not trading anything because the indicators never all
point in the same direction.
Stick to three indicators or fewer. Having more than three doesn’t add any
significant value.
If you’re still not convinced, consider the world of regression analysis, which
reinforces this point. A regression is simply a model that depicts how well one
factor or many factors explain something else. For example, housing prices
may be a function of location, the number of rooms in the house, and interest
rates. Think of housing prices as a security’s price, and think of the factors
used to predict prices as technical indicators. As a swing trader, you’re trying
to forecast the direction of prices based on the information contained in the
indicators. A model that explains housing prices well is useful for forecasting.
One way to improve a regression’s ability to explain the variable you’re trying
to predict is to add additional factors. In this example, you may add the color
of the house or the number of garages to the model. If the additional factor
doesn’t add value, the model’s ability to forecast remains unchanged. But if
the additional factor adds some value — regardless of how minute — the mod-
el’s effectiveness improves. But that doesn’t mean you should forecast using
25 variables when 3 key ones explain most of the variability in housing prices.
The same holds true with technical indicators.
Inputs should always fit your time horizon
Practically every technical indicator has settings that can be adjusted. Moving
averages, for example, can be set to short-term lengths (4 days and 9 days) or
long-term lengths (50 days and 200 days). The smaller the number, the quicker
an indicator responds to changes in price. The downside to such quick reflexes
is an increased number of whipsaws, when prices move violently and throw
indicators off. The larger the input figure used in an indicator, the fewer the
number of whipsaws.
However, you can’t use an unresponsive indicator. Trading based on the
200-day moving average may generate two or three signals a year, and that
doesn’t help when you’re looking to trade in and out of shares over the next
week. The input you use should always fit your time horizon.
Some swing traders experiment with each indicator on each security, testing
the historical effectiveness of an indicator on a particular security. They may
even adjust the technical indicator’s inputs for each security they trade. I

Chapter 5: Asking Technical Indicators for Directions
don’t recommend this approach. Besides being complex and time consuming,
it doesn’t provide a clear payoff in the long run. Customizing indicators for each
security also may lead to curve fitting. Curve fitting occurs when you try addi-
tional input numbers until one of them produces the so-called best fit. But those
factors may be the result of chance and have little relevance for future trading.
Divergences are the strongest
signals in technical analysis
Divergences represent low-risk entry points — or exits if you’re holding a
position contradictory to the technical indicator — because the market
crowd is convinced that either buyers or sellers are stronger than the other,
when in fact the opposite is true. Divergences don’t always lead to profitable
results, but they’re more accurate than most signals coming from indicators.
When a technical indicator, like stochastics, diverges from the price chart, an
alert should go off in your mind (ideally relating to the chart you’re examining),
because divergences represent a contradiction of sorts between the exterior
and interior of a security (sounds deep, doesn’t it?). The contradiction comes
about when prices move in one direction and the indicator moves in another.
Well-respected technical analysts, such as Alexander Elder or John Murphy,
have said that divergences are the strongest signals in technical analysis.
Unfortunately, divergences are difficult to screen for. You can ask your tech-
nical analysis software program to search for securities where this indicator
crossed over that one. But divergences usually require an interpretive eye, so
score one for humankind versus the machines!
Determining Whether a
Security Is Trending
To swing trade successfully, you need to know whether a security is trending
so you can apply the right indicator. Because of the importance of correctly
applying trending indicators to trending markets and non-trending indicators
to non-trending markets, the next logical question you should ask yourself is:
How do I know whether the market I’m looking at is trending?
You can answer this question in two ways. Both approaches should yield the
same answer if done correctly, so the approach you choose to use doesn’t
make a huge difference.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
One way of determining whether a trend exists is to eyeball a security’s
chart. If you see a series of higher highs and higher lows or a series of lower
highs and lower lows, you know a trend exists. Black and white signals don’t
exist when it comes to eyeballing a security’s price chart and calling a trend
or non-trend (that is, trading range). The onus is on you to recognize trend-
ing markets and non-trending ones.
When eyeballing a chart, the first question you should ask is: Do I see a series
of higher lows and higher highs or a series of lower lows and lower highs? If
the answer is yes to either question, then you’re working with a security that’s
trending. If the answer’s no, then your next question is: Do I see a clear sup-
port area that prices consistently rise from and a clear resistance area that
prices consistently fall from? If the answer’s yes, you’re working with a secu-
rity that’s non-trending or in a trading range. Note: If the answers to the first
and second questions are no, then the security you’re looking at can’t be clas-
sified and should be avoided.
Timeframe affects what you see. You may observe a security’s price chart
that’s set to hourly bars and see a clear trend but switch to a daily bar chart
and see an obvious trading range. As a swing trader, you should rely on hourly
and daily bar charts. Anything longer is appropriate only for position traders
or buy-and-hold investors.
If eyeballing isn’t your cup of tea, have no fear — a technical indicator can come
to your rescue. The most popular indicator that shows whether a security is
trending is the Average Directional Index (ADX), which actually measures the
strength of a trend rather than its direction. Part of the Directional Movement
Index (DMI; see the later section on DMI for details on this indicator), ADX
(cid:2) Can be plotted by itself
(cid:2) Oscillates between the values of 0 and 100
(cid:2) Is the average difference between the two other components of the DMI
(covered in more detail later in this chapter)
All ADX examples in this chapter calculate the indicator over a period of 14
days, the standard setting for this popular indicator.
If a security’s ADX reading is 20 or below, that security is in a trading range. If the
ADX reading is 30 or higher, consider that security to be in a trend. Readings
between 20 and 30 are ambiguous. When I see a reading between 20 and 30, I
incorporate the direction of the ADX into my analysis to help me determine
whether the security’s trending. For example, if ADX is rising and above 20,
then I consider that as a sign that the security’s trending. On the other hand,
if the ADX value is below 30 and falling, I consider that as a sign the security
may be in or may be entering a trading range.

Figure 5-4 shows ADX applied to a price chart for shares of MEMC Electronic
Materials (symbol: WFR). This security experienced a strong uptrend in late
2006 through mid-2007. The ADX indicator was solidly above 20 during this
period. However, MEMC Electronic Materials entered into a trading range in
May 2007. On May 9, 2007, the ADX indicator fell below 20, a move that sig-
naled a period when non-trending indicators should’ve been applied.

Recognizing Major Trending Indicators
The number of trending indicators out there is mind-boggling, but all trending
indicators are based on price, volume, or both. So using several trending indi-
cators on a single chart doesn’t give you an advantage. To get the most benefit
from trending indicators, never use more than two or three.
Unlike non-trending indicators, trending indicators tend to have no upper
or lower limits. The higher an indicator’s reading, the stronger the under-
lying trend. You should only apply trending indicators after you’ve deter-
mined that a security is in fact trending either by eyeballing the chart or by
using the ADX indicator, which I explain in the earlier section, “Determining
Whether a Security Is Trending.”
The last item you want to remember about trending indicators is that they
can be applied to all securities: stocks, commodities, mutual funds, ETFs, and
so on. You can even apply them to price derivatives, such as the ratio between
two securities. How you interpret trending indicators is the same regardless of
whether you apply the indicators to prices or to some derivative of prices.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
The following sections help you get up close and personal with three major
trending indicators:
(cid:2) Directional Movement Index (DMI)
(cid:2) Moving averages
(cid:2) Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
The compass of indicators: Directional
Movement Index (DMI)
The Directional Movement Index (DMI) is a powerful technical indicator. Not
only does it reveal whether a security is trending, but it also reveals the
direction of that trend, whether it’s increasing in strength, and when it ends.
DMI is composed of three plots:
(cid:2) +DMI: The positive directional movement index (+DMI) plot indicates how
effective bulls were in pushing prices above the previous day’s high. +DMI
ranges between 0 and 100. The higher the reading, the stronger the bulls.
(cid:2) –DMI: The negative directional movement index (–DMI) plot shows how
efficient bears were in pushing prices below the previous day’s low. –DMI
ranges between 0 and 100. The higher the reading, the stronger the bears.
(cid:2) ADX: ADX measures the difference between +DMI and –DMI. So basically
it measures the strength — or lack thereof — of a trend. (For more on
ADX, see “Determining Whether a Security Is Trending,” earlier in this
chapter.)
Swing traders use crossovers in +DMI and –DMI as trading signals. When +DMI
crosses above –DMI, buyers have wrestled control of shares. When –DMI crosses
above +DMI, on the other hand, sellers have wrestled control of shares. Frequent
crossovers between +DMI and –DMI signify that neither bulls nor bears have con-
trol of shares, a fact that’s reflected in an ADX reading below 20.
Most charting software calculates DMI over 14 days and uses 25 as the
standard ADX average. Both settings are worthwhile.
Figure 5-5 provides a sample of what DMI looks like in shares of Alvarion
(symbol: ALVR). When –DMI crosses above +DMI, as it did on October 8, a
sell signal is generated. Notice that ADX remains above 20 throughout the
crossover.

==================================================

99
Chapter 5: Asking Technical Indicators for Directions
Figure 5-5:
A chart
of ALVR
includes a
chart of the
DMI.
I don’t trade off of the crossovers of +DMI and –DMI, nor do I recommend you
do so. Although practically every uptrend and downtrend is preceded by the
corresponding +DMI or –DMI crossing above the other, whipsaws occur fre-
quently. It’s difficult to tell when a crossover occurs whether the security’s
still trending or is entering a trading range. That’s why I find DMI to be of
more value when used as an exit indicator than when used as an entry indica-
tor. While I’m long shares of XYZ Corp., for example, I don’t want to see –DMI
cross over +DMI — ever. If it does, I exit as quickly as possible. The reverse is
true if I’m short shares of ABC Corp.
Use DMI in the following manner to get the most bang for your investing buck:
1. Confirm that a trend is in place by using the ADX plot in the DMI.
2. If a trend exists, enter a trade using moving averages or MACD.
For more on either of these trend-following indicators, check out the fol-
lowing sections in this chapter.
3. Enter in the direction of +DMI or –DMI.
If +DMI is above –DMI, enter on the long side. If –DMI is above +DMI,
enter on the short side.
4. Exit when +DMI or –DMI crosses above its counterpart.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
A mean, lean revelation machine:
Moving averages
Moving averages — rolling averages of price data designed to reveal the under-
lying trend in that data — are the most widely used technical indicators. When
you use them, understand that the shorter the average, the more frequently
the average generates signals.
A ten-day moving average, for example, averages the last ten days of price
history. On the eleventh day, the moving average drops the oldest day and
uses the new day in its formula. (Note: The simple moving average equally
weights all bars in its calculation.)
You’ll encounter two types of moving averages in your swing-trading ventures,
and whether you use one more than the other is entirely up to you:
(cid:2) Simple moving averages: This indicator reveals the consensus price
agreement over X number of days, where X represents the length of the
moving average. When prices rise above their ten-day moving average,
for example, you can conclude that market participants believe the secu-
rity’s value is rising above the average of the last ten days. Conversely,
when a security’s price falls below its ten-day moving average, the secu-
rity’s value is falling below the consensus price over the last ten days.
(cid:2) Exponential moving averages (EMA): This indicator also shows consen-
sus price agreement over a certain time frame, but it weights historical
prices differently. Exponential moving averages respond faster than
simple moving averages because they weight recent price action more
heavily than older price action. The downside to this responsiveness is
an increase in the number of false signals.
Figure 5-6 provides a comparison of the two moving averages using a chart
with a nine-day simple moving average and a nine-day EMA. This chart shows
shares of Smith International (symbol: SII) in late 2007 and early 2008. The
slope of the EMA changes before the slope of the simple moving average, as
highlighted on January 3, 2008, and February 7, 2008. On both days, the EMA
gave a signal one day before the simple moving average. But this quickness
came at the cost of whipsaws. Notice that on December 17, 2007, the slope
of the EMA turned negative prematurely, whereas the slope of the simple
moving average remained positive. A swing trader relying on the EMA may
have exited too early and missed out on a price gain of 10 percent in 10 days.
The most important part of both moving averages is slope. The slope can be
positive (the moving average is rising), negative (the moving average is falling),
or zero (the moving average is flat).

Chapter 5: Asking Technical Indicators for Directions
You should always trade in the direction of the slope. If you’re looking to buy
a security, the slope of that security’s moving average must be positive — no
exceptions. If you’re looking to short a security, the slope of that security’s
moving average must be negative — no exceptions. You can trade a security
either when the slope of the moving average turns positive or negative —
depending on whether you’re buying or shorting — or when multiple moving
averages cross.

Swing trading securities based on a moving average isn’t a complete trad-
ing system. The moving average is simply an entry signal. It doesn’t tell you
how much of your capital to allocate to the position, where you should place
your stop loss, or when you’ll take profits. For more on these topics, flip to
Chapter 10.
In the next couple of sections, I show you how to swing trade using slope
changes and moving average crossovers.
Riding the roller coaster: Trading slope changes
The first question you must consider when trading securities based on the
slope changes of moving averages is what moving-average length, or the
number of days, to use. Assuming you’re using daily charts, stick to a moving-
average length of 18 days or fewer. (I’m partial to the nine-day moving aver-
age myself.)
After you’ve determined the number of days you’re looking at, follow these
steps to buy a desired security using slope changes:
1. Find a security that’s trending, as shown by the ADX indicator.
1100__229933668833--cchh0055..iinndddd 110011 77//2288//0088 66::5511::3388 PPMM

==================================================

102
Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
When the ADX indicator is above 20, the security’s trending. But you
still don’t know the direction of that trend. You can figure it out by
simply examining the chart and determining whether prices are forming
a series of higher lows and higher highs or a series of lower highs and
lower lows. Or you can use the DMI indicator described previously in
this chapter.
Trade only in the direction of the trend. If the trend is up and the nine-
day moving average slope turns negative, don’t short the security. While
the slope of the moving average is negative, the overall trend is positive;
shorting in these situations can be like swimming against the tide.
2. After you’ve determined that a trend is in place and that the direction
is up, buy when the slope of the moving average changes from flat or
negative to positive.
If you trade during market hours, the slope may change to positive at
10 a.m., only to be reversed by closing time at 4 p.m. If you can watch
the market intraday, I recommend trading in the last half hour, when it’s
likely the slope change won’t be reversed. Wait to trade on the day fol-
lowing the slope change if you can’t watch the market intraday.
3. Place the stop loss level below a recent low.
Some swing traders place their stop loss order below the low of the day
when the buy signal occurred, which represents the exit in the event of
loss.
4. Exit after the moving average turns flat or negative.
In the event of profit, you may exit when the slope of the moving average
turns from positive to negative, when a certain return objective is met,
or after a certain period of days. However, I prefer the method recom-
mended in this step.
The process for shorting securities based on slope changes isn’t all that dif-
ferent from the process for buying. Follow these steps:
1. Identify that a trend exists by using ADX or the eyeball approach.
2. Confirm that the direction of the trend is down by using DMI or the
eyeball approach.
3. Short when the moving average slope turns negative after being flat
or positive.
4. Place a stop loss above a recent peak.

Technologies are trending, so trending indicators are appropriate. In this
case, you’d wait for the slope to turn positive (if the slope is already positive,
you’ve missed the opportunity and should pass on the trade). After the slope
turns positive, buy the security with a stop loss below a recent trough (in
this scenario, $19.95 marks a recent trough). Your exit would depend on your
trading strategy.

Crissing and crossing: Trading moving average crossovers
Another way to use a moving average is by trading crossovers. Moving aver-
age crossovers occur more frequently than slope changes, which means
swing traders using crossovers may enter or exit a trade earlier than traders
relying on changes in the slope of a moving average. But nothing in this world
is free — that added earliness comes at the cost of increased whipsaws.
Multiple moving averages convey information on the value of a security over
several time periods. When a short-term moving average crosses above a
moving average of longer length, market participants are beginning to change
their opinion of the security. Specifically, the company’s short-term value is
increasing over its long-term value, a move that may signal the beginning of a
new trend or the continuation of a previous trend.
When a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving aver-
age, the security’s value is declining relative to price consensus established
over the long-term moving average, which may precede a price decline.
The basic method of trading moving average crossovers on the buy side is as
follows:
1. Determine whether a trend exists by using ADX or the eyeball
approach.
2. Confirm that a moving average crossover occurs in the direction of
the trend by using DMI or the eyeball approach.

3. Buy when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term
moving average.
4. Place a stop loss order below a recent trough.
5. Exit based on time, return objective, or when the short-term moving
average crosses below the long-term moving average.
Stick to moving averages that are 18 days in length or fewer. Although longer-
term moving averages — such as the 50-day moving average — are more
meaningful than shorter-term moving averages, they generate signals too
infrequently for swing traders.
I recommend you use the crossover of the four-day moving average and nine-
day moving average. When the four-day moving average crosses
(cid:2) Above the nine-day moving average in an established uptrend, you
should buy the underlying security
(cid:2) Below the nine-day moving average in an established downtrend, you
should short the underlying security
Figure 5-8 highlights a long trade in shares of Western Digital (symbol: WDC)
based on the crossover of the four-day moving average above the nine-day
moving average. If you’d found this potential trade when the four-day moving
average had already crossed above the nine-day moving average, you’d be
too late to buy it.

Chapter 5: Asking Technical Indicators for Directions
A meeting of the means: MACD
Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), a variation on the moving
average crossover covered in the preceding section, is a third popular trending
indicator. Unlike standard trending indicators, MACD shows the direction of a
trend as well as its intensity and measures the strength of buyers and sellers.
MACD is a plot of the difference between two exponential moving averages:
the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 26-day EMA. The MACD
line rises and falls as the difference between the 12-day EMA and the 26-day
EMA expands and contracts. When the 12-day EMA crosses above the 26-day
EMA, the MACD line crosses above 0. When the 12-day EMA crosses below the
26-day EMA, the MACD line crosses below 0.
But the difference of these two exponential moving averages isn’t the only
plot in the MACD indicator. Believe it or not, the MACD line has a moving aver-
age applied to it — an average of an average, if you will. And the difference
between the MACD line and its moving average is plotted as a histogram — a
graphical representation of this difference. A rising histogram is a sign that
buyers are increasing in strength. A falling histogram is a sign that sellers are
increasing in strength.
The standard settings for the MACD indicator are to use the 12-day and 26-day
exponential moving averages and to smooth out the MACD line using a 9-day
moving average. Go with ’em.
To see MACD in action and to fully understand its moving parts, take a look
at Figure 5-9, which shows MACD applied to shares of First Solar (symbol:
FSLR). The MACD line plot is shown along with the nine-day moving aver-
age of the MACD line. The difference between these two plots is represented
graphically in the form of a histogram below the two lines.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
MACD can generate trading signals in three ways:
(cid:2) Positive and negative divergences
(cid:2) MACD crossover above or below its nine-day moving average
(cid:2) MACD line crossing above or below the 0 line
I don’t recommend trading securities based off of the MACD line’s crossing of
the 0 line. Doing so is identical to trading a security based off of the crossover
of the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages. (For a refresher on EMAs,
see “A lean, mean revelation machine: Moving averages,” earlier in this chapter.)
The following sections delve into the ins and outs of trading using MACD.
Marking highs and lows: Positive and negative divergences in MACD
A positive divergence in MACD occurs when a security makes a new low
but the MACD histogram fails to confirm that low, indicating that sellers are
weakening in strength and that a trend change is imminent. A negative diver-
gence develops when a security’s price reaches a new high but the MACD
histogram fails to confirm that high, indicating that buyers are weakening and
that a trend change is looming.
Figure 5-10 depicts a positive divergence in the MACD histogram on a
mid-2007 chart of streetTRACKS Gold (symbol: GLD), an exchange traded
fund that tracks the prices of gold bullion. The positive divergence developed
in late June as the price of streetTRACKS Gold fell to new lows while the
MACD histogram made higher lows. The chart also shows an opportunity to
trade off of the crossover in the MACD line. In late April, this line fell below
its nine-day moving average, generating a sell signal.

107
Chapter 5: Asking Technical Indicators for Directions
If you use divergences, you must use a stop loss order after entering your
orders. Also, enter the position only after the MACD histogram turns in the
direction of the trade. If you’re looking to buy a positive divergence in MACD,
wait for the histogram to stop falling and turn up — that’s your signal to enter
the trade. If you’re looking to short a negative divergence in MACD, do the
opposite — wait for the histogram to stop rising and turn down.
Crossing the line: MACD crossover of its nine-day moving average
The MACD line often crosses over its nine-day moving average. When the
MACD line crosses above this moving average, you have a buy signal (assum-
ing trending markets). When the MACD line crosses below it, you have a sell
signal (again, assuming trending markets). You can interpret a moving aver-
age crossover the same as you would a standard moving average crossover
(see the earlier section, “Crissing and crossing: Trading moving average
crossovers,” for details).
Follow these steps to enter your trade:
1. Verify whether a trend is in place by using ADX or the eyeball
approach.
2. Wait for an MACD line to cross above (if you’re buying) or below (if
you’re shorting) its nine-day moving average.
3. Enter the day of the crossover (if you watch markets intraday) or the
day after the crossover (if you trade using end-of-day figures).
4. Place a stop loss below a recent low (if you’re buying) or above a
recent high (if you’re shorting).
5. Exit when the MACD line crosses back below (if you’re long) or above
(if you’re short) the nine-day moving average.
Refer to Figure 5-9 to see a moving average crossover signal highlighted in
shares of streetTRACKS Gold. Notice that in late April, the MACD line crossed
below its nine-day moving average, generating a sell signal.
Spotting Major Non-Trending Indicators
Non-trending indicators, also called oscillators, are designed to track swings
in trading ranges. Securities are in trading ranges more often than they trend.
Trading ranges represent a stalemate. Neither bulls nor bears can meaningfully
push prices past the battle lines. The bulls’ home front is the support zone.
The bears’ home front is the resistance zone. Both groups are struggling to
push prices deep into the other’s territory. And yet, every attempt is rebuffed.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Non-trending indicators are banded between two extreme values: one over-
bought and the other oversold. When bulls push prices to the area of resistance,
the security is overbought and is likely to reverse (otherwise, a trend would begin
and non-trending indicators wouldn’t be appropriate). The key to determining
whether a trend exists is to use the tried-and-true method of the ADX indicator or
the eyeball approach (see “Determining Whether a Security Is Trending” for how
to use the eyeball approach).
When ADX is below a value of 20, a trading range is in force, so you want
to use non-trending indicators to stay on the right side of the trade as you
attempt to profit from the back-and-forth swings in the trading range. The
wider the trading range, the more potential profit you can extract. A range
between $50 and $60 is more lucrative than one between $55 and $60 because
you have an opportunity to profit off of $10 in the range versus only $5 in the
narrower range.
The non-trending indicators you should get to know are stochastics and the
Relative Strength Index, both of which I cover in the next two sections.
Stochastics: A study of change over time
The most popular non-trending indicator is stochastics, which calculates the
position of today’s close relative to a range established over a time period
specified by the user. The higher the close today relative to the range, the
more overbought the security. An overbought security is expected to revert
to its mean. The best way to explain this phenomenon is to imagine stretch-
ing a rubber band as far as you can. If you let go, the rubber band snaps back
into place. Stochastics measures how far the rubber band stretches.
This particular indicator also points out when the rubber band is beginning
to contract and return to its starting position. Just because a security is over-
bought doesn’t mean it must immediately turn around and march back to the
oversold territory. Oh how easy trading would be if things were that simple!
Following are the two major components of the stochastics indicator:
(cid:2) %K plot: This plot measures where the current close of the security’s
price relates to the highest high and lowest low over a period.
(cid:2) %D plot: This plot is simply a three-day average of the %K plot.
Common swing trading practice calls for traders to use a 14-day stochastics
period. I see no reason to disagree.

==================================================

109
Chapter 5: Asking Technical Indicators for Directions
The stochastics indicator generates two main signals (which I explain further
in the following sections):
(cid:2) Positive and negative divergences between stochastics and the security’s
price pattern
(cid:2) Crossovers of %K and %D from above the overbought level or below the
oversold level
Positive and negative divergences
A positive divergence in stochastics forms when a security’s price falls to
a new low while the stochastics indicator traces a higher trough, signaling
that sellers are exhausted and buyers are preparing to turn prices around. A
negative divergence in stochastics can be seen when prices reach a new high
while the stochastics indicator traces a lower high, signaling that buyers are
exhausted and sellers are preparing to turn prices lower.
Figure 5-11 illustrates how a divergence, in this case between the price of
Best Buy (symbol: BBY) common stock and the stochastics indicator, can
flash an important signal about an imminent change in a security’s price
direction. While shares of Best Buy rallied to the $51 to $52 level twice in
December 2007, the stochastics indicator formed a lower peak on the second
rally. This movement signaled that buyers were exhausted and sellers were
gaining the upper hand. Shortly thereafter, shares of Best Buy fell 15 percent
in two weeks.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Follow these steps to use stochastics in your trading program:
1. Confirm whether a trading range exists by using ADX or the eyeball
approach.
2. If a trading range exists, buy or short after stochastics forms a positive
or negative divergence, respectively.
Enter the position on the long side only when %K turns up over %D. Enter
the position on the short side only when %K turns down under %D.
Crossovers from overbought and oversold levels
The more popular use of stochastics trading signals occurs when the %K
plot crosses over the %D plot and exits an overbought or oversold territory.
Charting programs peg overbought and oversold territories as 80 and 20,
respectively. This measurement simply means that when prices move to an
extreme, within 20 percent of the upper or lower boundaries of a historical
price range, you can expect a reversal of the extreme.
Amateur swing traders often buy a security in a trading range simply because
stochastics is overbought or oversold. This move is a recipe for whipsaws
galore. Instead, wait for stochastics to enter the overbought or oversold terri-
tory. After it has, consider your rifle aimed, but don’t pull the trigger just yet.
Wait for stochastics to exit the overbought or oversold area. By being patient,
you save yourself the heartache that can come when an overbought or over-
sold security decides to exit its range and enter a trend. When that occurs,
stochastics remains overbought or oversold for several days or weeks.
Figure 5-12 demonstrates several profitable trades of ImClone Systems (symbol:
IMCL) shares that could’ve been achieved by using the overbought and oversold
ranges in the stochastics indicator. With ADX below 20, shares of ImClone were
clearly in a trading range. In this type of scenario, you’d wait for stochastics
to enter the overbought territory (represented by the upper horizontal line)
and short when %K crosses below %D and below the overbought zone of 80.
Alternatively, you’d wait for stochastics to enter the oversold territory and buy
when %K crosses above %D and above the oversold zone of 20.
To trade using stochastics and the overbought and oversold levels, follow
these steps:
1. Identify whether a trading range exists by using ADX (preferably
below 20) or the eyeball approach.
2. Wait for %K to enter the overbought or oversold territory.
Short the security when %K crosses down through %D and below the
overbought zone. Buy the security when %K crosses up through %D and
above the oversold zone.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): A
comparison of apples and oranges
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an underused non-trending oscillator that
compares a security to itself. Not only does it tell you when a security’s price
is overbought or oversold, but it can also form chart patterns that are useful
for determining the likely direction of a breakout.
RSI isn’t relative strength in the traditional sense of the term. Relative
strength, as explained in Chapter 6, usually refers to comparing the strength
of one security to another. For example, shares of Microsoft may be advanc-
ing while the market is falling — a classic sign of relative strength.
RSI actually examines the price history of a security over a certain number of
days (14 is the standard setting, which I recommend). It compares the average
gain achieved on up days with the average loss realized on down days. An aver-
age of the gains on up days and the losses on down days is computed, and the
ratio between the two (average gains over average losses) yields the indicator.
Like most oscillators, the RSI is range-bound between 0 and 100. Unlike sto-
chastics (covered in the previous section), a reading below 30 indicates an
oversold level, whereas a reading above 70 indicates an overbought region.
RSI is particularly helpful, because chart patterns like the head-and-shoulders
1100__229933668833--cchh0055..iinndddd 111111 77//2288//0088 66::5511::4422 PPMM

or cup-and-handle patterns (explained in Chapter 4) form from time to
time. These chart patterns can be interpreted in the same way as if they’d
occurred in the price chart.
The next few sections cover the three major ways of using the RSI indicator
to trade by using
(cid:2) Positive and negative divergences
(cid:2) Chart patterns that develop in the RSI
(cid:2) The indicator’s turn down from an overbought region or turn up from an
oversold territory
Making use of positive and negative divergences in RSI
A positive or negative divergence develops when RSI fails to confirm a new
high or new low in a security’s price. You should trade divergences only after
RSI turns down (if the divergence is negative) or turns up (if the divergence is
positive). And of course, always use stop losses to protect your capital.
Follow these steps to trade divergences in the Relative Strength Index:
1. Determine whether a trading range exists by using ADX or the eyeball
approach.
2. Identify a divergence when the security makes a new high or new low
while the RSI fails to confirm the new peak or trough.
3. Wait for the RSI to turn up (in the case of positive divergences) or turn
down (in the case of negative divergences) before entering a position.
4. Keep a tight stop loss above a recent peak if you’re shorting or below
a recent trough if you’re buying.
You want to take this step in case the divergence fails or the security
traces multiple divergences.
Figure 5-13 shows a chart of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (symbol: REGN) that
demonstrates a negative divergence in RSI. Shares of REGN rally to new highs
while RSI traces lower troughs — a warning of underlying weakness.
Observing RSI chart patterns
Seeing chart patterns in RSI is uncommon. Yet these patterns are more reli-
able than trading based off of overbought or oversold zones. RSI chart pat-
terns may form at the same time as a chart pattern in the actual price of the
security.

the RSI indicator in shares of BioMimetic Therapeutics (symbol: BMTI). Despite
prices rallying to the $18 range, RSI signaled that an underlying weakness was
brewing when it formed a lower peak in early January 2008. The actual signal to
short didn’t occur until the head-and-shoulders pattern was completed by the
breakdown of RSI through the neckline. In a situation like this, you should short
on the breakdown of RSI through the right shoulder, also known as its turn down
from the overbought region (above 70).

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Trading the RSI indicator’s overbought and oversold zones
The process of trading the RSI indicator’s turn up from the oversold region
and turn down from the overbought region is nearly identical to the process
of trading overbought and oversold regions using stochastics, covered ear-
lier in this chapter. Here’s how you do it:
1. Figure out whether a trading range exists by using ADX (preferably
below 20) or the eyeball approach.
2. Wait for the RSI indicator to enter the overbought or oversold terri-
tory (above 70 or below 30 on most charting programs).
Short the security when RSI turns down from an overbought reading and
through the overbought zone. Buy when RSI turns up from an oversold
reading and through the oversold zone.
3. Exit after RSI reaches the opposite zone.
Alternatively, you can exit after a return target is achieved or a certain
number of days have passed.
Combining Technical Indicators
with Chart Patterns
Using technical indicators with chart patterns helps you increase your swing
trading accuracy. To combine the two, you need to evaluate trades based on
what the chart is saying and what the technical indicators are saying, and
only take those trades where both chart and indicators communicate the
same message. Perhaps the chart pattern is a cup-and-handle formation or a
potential breakaway gap to the upside — both positive developments. If your
technical indicator — say the DMI indicator — flashes a buy at that same
time, you may have good reason to believe a buy is profitable.
Figure 5-15 demonstrates this point beautifully. Shares of ManTech International
(symbol: MANT) develop what appears to be a classic cup-and-handle formation.
Cup-and-handle formations are bullish, and swing traders normally buy a security
after it crosses above its handle, as ManTech International did on December 19,
2007. However, the trade failed a few days later.
To spot the brewing trouble in a case like this, you can’t use chart patterns
alone. You need to use the RSI indicator in conjunction with a chart pattern
to avoid a loss on your trade. In this example, the RSI flagged a troubling
divergence forming during the cup-and-handle pattern. While prices of
ManTech International moved to new highs, the RSI failed to confirm that
strength.

Using Technical Indicators to Determine
Net Long or Net Short Positioning
One of the key questions you face as a swing trader is whether to be net long
or net short at any given time (net long simply means the value of your port-
folio’s long positions is higher than the value of your portfolio’s short posi-
tions; net short means the opposite).
When markets are roaring higher, you want the majority of your positions
to be on the long side. Any short positions you hold are likely to result in
losses or small profits, and it’s tough to fight the trend. When the markets
are falling, being net short is the way to go. Markets fall faster than they rise
because fear is a stronger emotion than greed. Long positions held in a bear
market are likely to result in losses.
Technical indicators are useful tools to assist you in determining whether to
be net long or net short. You may apply an indicator to a market index and
go net long or net short based on the signals you receive from that indicator.
But if you choose this route, make sure your indicator provides few and accu-
rate signals. You don’t want to be changing your net exposure weekly — or
worse, daily.
Your indicator or mechanism for determining when to be net long or net short
should respond quickly enough when a trend turns down. Test your indicator
on past market cycles to determine whether it caught downturns quickly or
slowly. Also make sure your indicator doesn’t generate so many signals that
whipsaws abound. Always strive for balance.

I recommend using the nine-week moving average. When the slope of the
nine-week moving average is negative, expect more trading opportunities to
be on the short side of the market. When the slope of the nine-week moving
average is positive, expect more trading opportunities to be on the long side
of the market. Figure 5-16 shows a chart of the S&P 500 Index with a nine-
week moving average.

You may rely on basic chart analysis to signal the changes between being net
long or net short. Remember that the long-term trend in the equity markets is
up, and therefore you’re likely to be net long far more often than you are net
short. This rule of thumb also holds true if you trade international stocks.

M
ost swing traders make their money in one of three ways: trading strong
trends, trading ranges, or both. A trend is the persistent up or down
movement of a security’s price. Trends can last anywhere from a few days to
a few years, but generally, a security must rise to new highs or fall to new lows
every few weeks to be considered trending (for a swing trader, that is; long-term
investors define trends in a different time frame). If you choose to accept trading
trends, your job is to find the strongest trends — up or down — and ride them
until you exit for a profit or are forced out for a loss (a small one, hopefully!).
Many markets and securities are neither trending upward nor downward,
though. Instead, they’re oscillating up and down between clearly defined
price levels called ranges. As with trends, trading ranges can occur over
short periods or long periods. The longer a trading range has been in place,
the more likely it is to continue. For example, if Dummies Corporation stock
has been trading between $50 and $60 for the last three months, it’s safe to
assume that the stock is in a trading range. Your job is to buy near $50 and
sell near $60.
But just what makes a trend strong or weak? And how do you know whether
to trade trends or ranges (or a mixture of both)? I help you figure out your
answers to these questions in this chapter. Please note, though, that in order
to fully understand the guidance in this chapter, you need to have a solid
understanding of chart patterns and technical indicators, which I cover in
Chapters 4 and 5 — head to those chapters first if you need a refresher.

Trading Trends versus Trading
Ranges: A Quick Rundown
Most swing traders focus primarily on trading trends simply because the
profits tend to be bigger than when trading ranges. The added beauty of
trends is that they require little or no work on your part to manage. In an
uptrend, the security’s price rises consistently and doesn’t fall much from its
highs — say 5 percent to 10 percent at the most. Entering a trend early (in
the first few days of the start of a new trend) allows you to enter when the
risk is lowest. Entering a trend that has been in place for several weeks or
(gulp!) months raises the chance that you’re getting on just when you should
be getting off.
The difficulty in riding trends arises from identifying when a trend has begun
and exiting quickly when it’s clear the trend is over. The latter problem is the
biggest concern for you as a swing trader. Trends aren’t difficult to find and
enter, but when a security moves counter to its trend, you have to decide
whether that move is simply a normal part of the trend development or some-
thing more sinister (the end of that trend).
Although trading ranges isn’t as popular among swing traders as trading
trends, don’t be fooled by the ranges’ small profits. Swing traders tend to
have a higher win ratio when trading ranges than when trading trends. In
other words, you may make smaller profits per trade if you trade ranges, but
you’ll also tend to be right more often than if you were trading trends.
One of the advantages of trading ranges versus trading trends is that with
ranges your profit and risk objectives are easily identified. Your profit objec-
tive is simply the other side of the range; for example, if you’re shorting a
stock at $60 per share, your goal is to cover that short near $50 per share.
Similarly, your risk is clearly defined: If you buy near $50 per share, you’re
going to exit your trade if the stock trades below $49 or $48. Such a move out-
side the established trading range likely signals the beginning of a new trend.
When trading ranges, the biggest risk you face is a security beginning a new
trend. Because your trade depends on the continuation of the range, you’re
unlikely to be on the right side of the trade should a trend develop. For exam-
ple, you could lose a bundle on a stock if you short shares near $60 (with a
range between $50 and $60) and the stock proceeds to break out above its
upper trading range of $60 per share and run to $70 or higher. If the stock
falls from $60 to $40, you miss the move from $50 to $40 because your profit
objective calls for exiting at the lower bound of the range. Therefore, you’re
unlikely to ever be on the right side of a trend if you focus on trading ranges.
So should you trade trends, ranges, or both?

Unfortunately, as with many aspects of swing trading, you won’t find a one-
size-fits-all answer. Some traders are looking for those big moves — that 10
percent or 20 percent move that will happen over a few days. They’re willing
to tolerate being wrong some (or even most) of the time in their quest for
home runs. Such swing traders should focus on trends. Other traders are
patient and are content with hitting singles and doubles each inning. They’re
fine with 3 percent or 5 percent returns on each trade. They’re right 50 per-
cent or more of the time, and they cut losses fast. Such swing traders are
best suited for trading ranges. If you’re not sure which method fits your per-
sonality, read about the methods outlined in this chapter and pick the one
you feel most comfortable with.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Advanced traders may use both methods to take advantage of both ranges
and trends. That’s because the overall market may determine whether range
trading or trend trading is easier at any given moment. A zooming bull market
pushes the majority of stocks higher, and trading ranges is difficult. A tough
bear market pushes the majority of stocks down, regardless of their funda-
mentals, and trends are few and far between when a market is gridlocked in a
trading range.
Trading on Trends
Trend trading is swinging for that home run and occasional grand slam.
Swing traders focusing on trends are looking for big returns in short periods.
They’re looking to enter a trend that has clearly established itself. Because
trends move fast and furious, they have to keep stop loss orders tight to exit
on a moment’s notice if the wave they’re riding crests.
So first things first: How exactly do you find strong enough trends to trade?
And when you find a strong trend, how do you know whether the time is right
to enter on that trend?
Finding a strong trend
You can find trending securities in multiple ways. You can do a bottom-up
search, where you’re looking up close at individual stocks, or you can do a
top-down search, where you’re scoping out industry groups and then narrow-
ing your view to individual stocks. You then can determine trend strength
through a variety of ways. One way is the eyeball approach, in which you
size up a chart by simply looking at it. Or you can use technical indicators
that tell you — with little interpretation — whether the security you want to
trade is trending and whether that trend is up or down. The ADX indicator is
often used to measure whether a security is trending or non-trending without
regard to whether the trend is upward or downward. Most popular charting
programs include the ADX or include it as part of the DMI indicator. You can
find out more about ADX and DMI indicators in Chapter 5.
An ADX reading above 20 signals a trend. The higher above 20 the ADX read-
ing is, the stronger the trend. But excessive values (for example, readings
above 40) may indicate an overheated trend that’s about to reverse.
Here’s a quick look at how you can use both search methods:
(cid:2) Bottom-up search: Trending stocks can be found daily in popular
newspapers like The Wall Street Journal or Investor’s Business Daily. For
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 112200 77//2288//0088 66::5533::0055 PPMM

==================================================

121
Chapter 6: Analyzing Char ts to Trade Trends, Ranges, or Both
example, each day both newspapers publish which stocks are making
new 52-week highs or new 52-week lows. These stocks are often trending
up or down, depending on whether the security is making a new high or
a new low. What you want to see is a stock that hasn’t made a new high
or a new low in a long time and then bursts onto the scene. These stocks
are often just beginning their trends.
Another bottom-up method of identifying trending stocks is through
research services. High Growth Stock (HGS) Investor software, for exam-
ple, allows users to screen stocks in particular groups, markets, and so
on by those making new highs or new lows over any chosen time period.
The period you choose should be long enough to signal a meaningful
trend, but not so short as to capture stocks moving normally up and
down. After all, a stock making a new one-day high isn’t very meaningful.
(cid:2) Top-down search: You can locate strongly trending stocks by looking at
strongly trending industry groups. Popular research services like Daily
Graphs, HGS Investor, and Morningstar provide data on which indus-
try groups are the top performers over the last several months. Just
because a group is hot right now, however, doesn’t mean it will be hot
forever; industries fall out of favor just as individual securities do.
Begin your search by looking at the top ten performing industry groups
and drilling down to find securities that may be trending. Again, you
want stocks just making new highs after a period of moving sideways.
Examine the chart and see if the security is clearly rising. You get more
tools on measuring trends using indicators in Chapter 5.
To find candidates to short, examine industry groups that fall in the
bottom 10 percent of performance. Then drill down into those groups to
locate individual stocks that are just breaking into new lows. These are
the prime candidates to short.
Just because a stock belongs to an industry group that’s in an uptrend
doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock is also trending or that it’s trending
upward. It’s possible to find stocks that belong to a hot industry but that are
falling on hard times. So make sure you’re only buying stocks in strong trends
in groups that are trending upward and shorting stocks in strong trends in
groups that are trending downward.
Figure 6-1 highlights shares of Mosaic Company (symbol: MOS), which is ripe
for trading a trending stock. On February 13, 2007, shares hit a 52-week high
and appeared in The Wall Street Journal on February 14, 2007.

Knowing when to enter a trend
The biggest risk swing traders who focus on trends face is the possibility of
buying or shorting a trend that’s just about to end. Ian Woodward, a profes-
sional trader, equates buying or shorting stocks late in their trends to acting
like an unruly dog chasing speeding cars. Sure, it may be fun for the dog, but
sooner or later he’s going to get run over.
To minimize your risk of riding a crashing wave, you must follow some
system that only enters at the right time. The ideal setup is a security making
a fresh, new high or low over the last 26 days.
So how do you know if the trend you’re riding is just beginning or winding
down? If you don’t have access to a security program that can identify such
new highs or new lows, then rely on The Wall Street Journal’s daily list of
stocks hitting 52-week highs or 52-week lows. Additionally, you want to see
an ADX reading above 20 to indicate the presence of a trend.
As with all aspects of trading, you can never be 100 percent sure about a
trade. The best you can do is put the odds in your favor by only entering on
some type of signal. If the trend is genuine and is going to continue, you’ve
entered early. If the trend is failing, you’ll know shortly because your signal
will likely reverse itself if the trend ends or breaks down.
The signal you use can be based on chart patterns or technical signals. Generally,
chart patterns give traders earlier warning than technical signals, but technical
indicators require little interpretation, which makes your job easier. For example,
a stock rising above its 50-day moving average could be a signal to buy, or a MACD
crossover (covered in Chapter 5) could be a signal to short (depending on the
direction of the crossover). Many swing traders only enter trends on the long
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 112222 77//2288//0088 66::5533::0055 PPMM

Chapter 6: Analyzing Char ts to Trade Trends, Ranges, or Both
or short side when a security first makes a new high or new low of X number
of days, provided this is the first new high or new low in the last month or
two. Otherwise, you run the risk of buying or shorting a stock that’s extended
or has been making new highs and new lows for a long time.
Another approach to entering swing trade orders is to wait for a pause in the
trend and enter on a day of strength or day of weakness.
(cid:2) To enter on a day of strength, you must wait for the stock to form three
consecutive bars of declining highs. Then you enter on the next bar that
trades higher than the previous bar’s high.
(cid:2) To enter on a day of weakness, you must wait for the stock to form
three consecutive bars of rising lows. Then you enter on the next bar
that trades lower than the previous bar’s low.
In Figure 6-2, the chart of Apple Inc. (symbol: AAPL) shows a strong uptrend
that began in late July 2007 on a strong gap up in share prices. After rising 40
percent, shares retraced their steps and made three consecutive lower highs
marked by the numbers 1, 2, and 3. (Notice that the day prior to number 1
doesn’t count because its high exceeds the previous bar.) After making four
lower highs, the stock moved higher and exceeded the high of the fourth bar,
signaling the continuation of the uptrend and an ideal entry point.
Whatever signal method you use, make sure to only enter the trade on that
actual signal. You’ll find dozens of trending stocks that gave signals 5, 10, or
20 days ago — ignore them. You can’t be disciplined if you’re entering trends
late. Only enter on a signal you choose.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
If you look back at Figure 6-1, you’ll notice that the 52-week high registered
on February 13, 2007, was the first in two months. Remember, you want to
avoid buying a strong trending stock that has been making new 52-week
highs every other day. An extended period of time between 52-week highs is a
means of protecting yourself from buying an extended stock. Enter either on
the sign of a new high or on a day of strength (the day of strength approach
will help you avoid getting run over by speeding cars).
Figure 6-3 highlights the day of strength for Mosaic and the ADX reading
above 20 on that day. In this example, the day of strength allows ADX time to
give a clear signal on whether the stock is trending or not. Should you have
entered on February 14, 2007, the day of the 52-week high? That depends on
what your trading strategy calls for: If you buy new highs immediately, then
the answer is yes. However, I recommend using ADX as a means of weeding
out weak trends from strong trends. In this case, the ADX was below 20 on
the day the stock made a new high. The ADX indicator didn’t register a read-
ing over 20 until February 20, 2007.

Managing your risk by
setting your exit level
Setting your exit level will depend on when you enter the security. I cover
exit levels in more detail in Chapter 10, but in short, your exit price (think of
it as your emergency exit) will either be based off a technical-indicator signal,
a price level, or a time exit (that is, exiting after a certain number of days
have elapsed). Your target likely will be based off a technical indicator or
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 112244 77//2288//0088 66::5533::0066 PPMM

125
Chapter 6: Analyzing Char ts to Trade Trends, Ranges, or Both
price level because of the ease of establishing the exit rules. Following is an
explanation of each of these exit-setting mechanisms:
(cid:2) Technical-indicator exit signal: This includes exiting on the break down
below a moving average or on a crossover of MACD (both of which are
covered in Chapter 5).
(cid:2) Price-level exit level: Entering on a new, 52-week high will require an
exit level right in the trading range that the stock is emerging from. If
you bought shares of Mosaic as they made a new high on February 13,
you would set an exit level between $21 and $22 per share. If the trend is
real, the stock shouldn’t fall back into its original base.
(cid:2) Time-based exit level: Because the target exit price isn’t important to
demonstrate how to enter and manage the Mosaic trade, I assume a
simple time-based target of 20 days.
If you enter on the day of strength that I recommend in the preceding
section, your exit level is easier to compute than it would be using the other
methods identified here. In this case, your exit should be based off the low
directly preceding the day of strength.
Trading Ranges: Perhaps Stasis Is Bliss?
Finding a security in a trading range can be more difficult than a finding a
trending stock. Screening for securities making new highs or new lows is
much easier.
Technical indicators (which I cover in Chapter 5) can be useful in identify-
ing when a security is in a trading range and when to enter or exit a trade.
However, not all technical indicators are applicable to trading ranges.
Trending indicators, as the name suggests, are useful when a security is in a
trend. Non-trending indicators (often called oscillators), on the other hand,
should be used when securities are in a trading range. You should choose
one or two oscillators (at most) to use in a trading system.
Finding a security in a
strong trading range
When swing traders want to determine if a security is in a trading range, they
often use an ADX indicator. The calculator methodology is beyond the scope
of this book, but I can tell you that most popular charting programs include
ADX (or include ADX as part of the DMI indicator). What you need to know is
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 112255 77//2288//0088 66::5533::0077 PPMM

==================================================

126
Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
that an ADX value below 20 signals a non-trending market, and an ADX value
above 20 often signals a trending market.
A range must be wide enough to allow for meaningful profits. For example, if
a stock trades between $56 and $60, the range would be so tight that profits
would be eaten up by commissions, taxes, and so on. No hard and fast rule
exists for how wide is wide enough, but $5 to $7 on a stock trading below $100
is a good range to target.
The strength of trading ranges depends on a few factors:
(cid:2) Time: The longer a trading range has been in force, the more likely it is
to continue.
(cid:2) Touches of support and resistance: The more times a security touches
its support and/or resistance level (see Chapter 4), the more powerful
that support or resistance level is. Look for trading ranges with several
touches or tests of support and resistance.
(cid:2) Flat ranges: When I refer to flat ranges, I mean how much a trading range
resembles a rectangle. Some trading ranges have resistance levels that rise
or support levels that fall; these ranges are suspect because they don’t
clearly identify true areas of support or resistance. In fact, they may be
some other chart formation entirely. The flatter the support and resistance
levels, the stronger your conviction should be that the trading range is
genuine.
Figure 6-4 shows a chart of MEMC Electronics Materials (symbol: WFR). You
can see the trading range by eyeballing the chart and identifying clear sup-
port and resistance levels. Notice also that the ADX level is below 20 on the
chart, signaling a non-trending market.

Chapter 6: Analyzing Char ts to Trade Trends, Ranges, or Both
Entering on a range and
setting your exit level
Your entry is likely to be driven by either a day of strength (defined earlier
in this chapter) or a technical signal. For the MEMC Electronics example, I
assume you’re using stochastics (an indicator useful in measuring strength
or weakness in trendless markets; see Chapter 5 for more on stochastics) to
signal a buy order.
Stochastics flashes a buy signal when the signal line crosses above the
moving average from an oversold level. That area is highlighted in Figure
6-5. In the case of MEMC Electronics, the buy signal from stochastics occurs
when shares are around $55.
Figure 6-5:
This chart
shows a buy
signal from
stochastics
and a profit
objective
near the
upper end of
the trading
range.
The target profit in trading ranges is just the opposite side of the trading
range. In this case, resistance was solid around $65 per share, so a reason-
able profit target is $64. Shares of WFR hit that level roughly six weeks after
the buy signal was generated.
The risk level of this trading range is located slightly below the support level.
A meaningful movement in share price below the support level signals the
trading range has ended, but don’t be strict on what you consider mean-
ingful. For example, if the support level is at $52, a risk level of $51 may be
unreasonable given the volatility in the chart.
I prefer to set risk levels right below major, whole, round numbers. Traders
often fall into the trap of putting stop loss orders or buy stop orders at round
number levels. The problem with setting risk levels or buy orders at round num-
bers is that hundreds of other traders may be the doing the exact same thing,
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 112277 77//2288//0088 66::5533::0077 PPMM

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
meaning that you’re likely to get a bad execution or get whipsawed (shaken
out of the trade by a rapid price movement).
For the example shown in Figure 6-5, with support at $52 and an upper resis-
tance level at $65, I recommend placing a stop loss order right below $50
per share. In my view, a trade below $50 is a good indication that the trading
range has ended and the stock is beginning a downtrend.
Note: Right after the buy signal from stochastics is generated, shares of WFR
trade down sharply, touching a low of $49.70. (Notice, though, that shares
never close below $53.) If you had set your risk level exit at $50, you would
have been exited from this trade early.

Intermarket technicians analyze currencies, equity markets, bonds, and
commodities to determine which market holds the most promise. Often, an
upturn in one market signals an upturn or downturn in another market, and
intermarket analysis can give you an early lead on a rally or decline in that
sector or market. Rising bond prices often precede equity market rallies.
Rising commodity prices, on the other hand, can lead to a downturn in stock
prices. Knowing the relationships among the four major markets — bonds,
currencies, commodities, and stocks — means that you can anticipate
changes in market leadership.
I begin this review of intermarket analysis by taking a bird’s-eye view of the
investment landscape. Currencies (specifically, the U.S. dollar) analysis is
helpful as investors seek to profit from strength or weakness in an investor’s
domestic currency. Then I cover commodities (for example, oil, gold, and
copper) because commodity prices have been in a major bull market in the
last few years. I also get into bond prices and interest rates. Bonds are the
biggest competitor to the equity markets, so strength or weakness in bonds
can lead to strength or weakness in equity prices.
Passing the buck: The U.S. dollar
The U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency, or the most widely used cur-
rency. The dollar is affected by a host of factors, including the interest rates
the Federal Reserve sets (known as monetary policy), the national debt, and the
current budget deficit or surplus. As you may have learned in your economics

Chapter 6: Analyzing Char ts to Trade Trends, Ranges, or Both
course, the value of a currency (assuming it freely floats on the world markets)
is determined by the supply and demand for that currency.
The Federal Reserve controls short-term interest rates in the United States,
and short-term interest rates, in turn, have a significant impact on the value
(or demand) for U.S. dollars. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates,
the dollar is likely to strengthen because investors seek out high yields on
their investments. A government that pays 10 percent interest on short-term
investments will attract a flood of investors from the outside world, prompt-
ing strength in that country’s currency. However, if that government cuts
interest rates to 2 percent, fewer investors will be willing to loan their money
to the government or banks in that country (assuming other world yields are
higher than 2 percent), thus weakening that nation’s currency.
Fiscal policies affect the dollar but usually take longer to materialize. If the
U.S. government spends more than it has (that is, it generates budget defi-
cits), the dollar’s value may decrease because a budget deficit represents
borrowing money today at the expense of paying it back in the future. The
larger the deficit or national debt, the more pressure on the dollar. Think of
it this way: The more the government spends, the more available U.S. dollars
are. By increasing the supply, you decrease prices.
So how can you make money with this knowledge? Here’s how you may benefit
when the dollar strengthens or weakens:
(cid:2) Dollar strengthening: When the U.S. dollar strengthens, it usually bodes
well for U.S. stocks and U.S. bonds. International investors are attracted to
strong currencies because the investors can increase their potential return
by profiting from the rise in a U.S. stock and a rise in the U.S. currency.
(cid:2) Dollar weakening: Weakness in the U.S. dollar can translate into higher
commodity prices. Look for gold, crude oil, and other world commodities
to benefit from a weak dollar.
The chart in Figure 6-6, which shows the U.S. dollar (top) and gold prices
(bottom), illustrates how intermarket analysis can boost your returns. The
U.S. dollar began a major decline in August 2007 while gold prices began
a major advance. If you see the U.S. dollar weaken, look for swing trading
opportunities on the long side in commodities or commodity-related securities
(like gold miners or oil explorers). A weak U.S. dollar tends to lead to higher
commodity prices (in U.S. dollars), and a strong U.S. dollar tends to lead to
lower commodity prices (in U.S. dollars).

Tracking commodities
Commodities come in different flavors:
(cid:2) Energy commodities include items like crude oil, heating oil,
and natural gas.
(cid:2) Metal commodities include gold, silver, and platinum.
(cid:2) Livestock and meat commodities include live cattle and lean hogs.
(cid:2) Agricultural commodities include corn and soybeans.
Between the 1980s and early 2000, commodities didn’t get much respect and
were considered unimportant in the so-called new economy. Many traders
underweighted or divested altogether investments in the commodity space.
All that changed in 2000. With the equity market top in 2000, investors sought
out new investment opportunities, and gold, oil, and other commodities
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 113300 77//2288//0088 66::5533::0088 PPMM

benefited from the interest. Later, at the turn of the 21st century, demand
for commodities from emerging markets like China and India rose markedly.
Because commodity prices in general had been poor investment options in
prior years, commodity producers hadn’t invested in sourcing new supplies.
For example, because crude oil prices had been range-bound during much of
the 1990s, energy firms didn’t invest in new equipment or search for new oil
discoveries. As a result, prices of these commodities shot up when demand
increased.
Most individual investors never buy commodities directly because of the
sophistication needed to trade futures contracts. But recent innovations have
allowed equity investors to take advantage of movements in commodity prices.
For example, a trader wanting to take advantage of a bull market in gold
prices can purchase shares of GLD, the streetTRACKS Gold shares, which trade
on the New York Stock Exchange.
You can track the prices of commodities in many ways, but the most popular
baskets are the Commodity Research Bureau Index and the Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index.
Although commodities can make you a pretty penny (made out of copper, I
might add), they also give important signals on the direction of other asset
classes. Commodities represent goods that you and I buy day-to-day —
whether we realize it or not. When prices of commodities rise, inflation can
result. Inflation is a principal risk of bond investors because interest pay-
ments aren’t adjusted for the value of the dollar.
Therefore, commodity prices tend to correlate negatively to bond prices
(and thus, positively correlate with interest rates because bond yields move
inversely to bond prices). Rising commodity prices usually occur with falling
bond prices and rising yields. Conversely, falling commodity prices usually
occur with rising bond prices and falling yields.
No relationship is guaranteed in the financial market, and it’s possible for
commodity prices to trend in the same direction as bond prices. But such
action is unlikely to last long. Bond investors eventually sell bonds if they
believe the risks of inflation are rising. A small move in the prices of commodi-
ties may not convince them that such a risk is imminent, but a sustained rally or
decline in commodity prices affects the strength or weakness in bond prices.
Figure 6-7 shows just how that relationship played out in 2006. Commodity
prices, as measured by the CRB Index, began rallying in late March. Shortly
thereafter, bond prices fell (and bond yields rose). The bottom chart shows
the yield on the 30-Year Treasury Bond. As you can see, commodity prices
and bond yields move in the same direction. As a swing trader, you can use
this knowledge to your advantage — a sustained rally in commodity prices
leads to higher bond yields and trading opportunities for bond traders.

Commodity price performance relative to bonds can help you pinpoint
market sectors to target for investments. Here are some guidelines:
(cid:2) If the ratio between commodity prices and bond prices is rising (meaning
that commodity prices are outperforming bond prices), you should look
for investment in sectors that are inflation-sensitive, like basic material
manufacturers (aluminum manufacturers, copper producers, energy
companies, and so on).
(cid:2) If the ratio between commodity prices and bond prices is falling (mean-
ing that bond prices are outperforming commodity prices), then look for
investment opportunities in interest rate-sensitive sectors such as home
builders, real estate, and utilities.

Chapter 6: Analyzing Char ts to Trade Trends, Ranges, or Both
Watching how bond price and stock price
movements correlate
Stocks and bonds are major investment vehicles for millions of people and
institutions the world over. The interest rates that bonds pay are principal
competitors to stock investments. The higher the interest rate offered, the
less investors will allocate to stocks. The lower the interest rate bonds pay,
the more investors will allocate to stocks.
Bond prices are extremely sensitive to inflation. As inflation rises, the value
of the series of payments that bonds pay decreases. A poor Consumer Price
Index reading from the government will cause bond prices to fall. A low infla-
tion report, on the other hand, tends to push bond prices higher.
Many valuation models of the U.S. stock market compare the yield on gov-
ernment or corporate bonds to the earnings yield of equity securities. For
example, the Fed Model (covered in detail in chapter 8) compares the yield
on the 10-Year Treasury Bond to the earnings yield of the S&P 500 Index. If the
10-Year Treasury Bond currently yields 5 percent and the S&P 500 Index for-
ward P/E ratio is 15 times earnings, investors using this model would conclude
that equity prices are undervalued when compared to bonds. (To get the earn-
ings yield of the S&P 500 Index, you simply calculate 1 divided by the P/E ratio.
In this example, 1 divided by 15 equals 6.67 percent, which is higher than the 5
percent the 10-Year Treasury Bond paid.)
Bond prices tend to lead stock price movements. As bond prices rally, bond
yields fall, making stocks an attractive alternative. Conversely, falling bond
prices (and thus, rising bond yields) tend to lead stock price weakness. This
relationship doesn’t hold in deflationary environments where bond prices
rise while stock prices fall. However, deflationary environments are the
exception in U.S. economic history.
Figure 6-8 highlights an example of the typical relationship between equity
prices and bond prices. The figure compares bond yields for the 30-Year
Treasury Bond (top) and the S&P 500 Index (bottom) in 1996–1997. Notice
that a peak in the yield of the 30-Year Bond in July 1996 corresponds with a
bottom in equity prices. A similar peak/bottom occurs in April 1997. A sus-
tained decline in bond yields corresponds with a rallying equity market. But
correlation doesn’t imply causation. In other words, although there’s a rela-
tionship between these markets, you can’t say that the rally in equity prices
was caused by the declining yield of the 30-Year Treasury Bond.
As a swing trader, you should watch the relationship between bond yields
and stock prices. When yields enjoy a sustained rally, be on the lookout for a
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 113333 77//2288//0088 66::5533::1100 PPMM

pullback in stock prices. You may enter short trades, for example, in securities
breaking down to new 52-week lows. If you see yields falling, it may precede
a rally in stock prices. Be on the lookout for stocks hitting 52-week highs or
exhibiting strength via breakouts from trading ranges.

Putting Securities in a Market Head-to-
Head: Relative Strength Analysis
A twist on intermarket analysis is intramarket analysis, often called relative
strength analysis. In addition to comparing markets to one another, swing
traders should use intramarket analysis to compare securities within one
market. Relative strength analysis is like having your own pair of X-ray vision
goggles that allow you to see which securities are truly strong and which are
totally faking it.
Relative strength analysis involves charting one security or index relative
to another. The ratio generated from the two can be analyzed like any stock
chart. Most charting programs calculate such ratios for you with the click of
a mouse. You can compare all sorts of things against each other: Apple Inc.
versus Google, or Clorox versus the overall market. You can even compare
markets against each other to get an idea of when leadership switches from
one market to the other.
Suppose you want to buy a strong stock. Should you be focusing on large
cap, mid cap, or small cap stocks? Relative strength analysis can answer
that question. By comparing one group to another, you can detect when one
group is strengthening relative to the other.

But be careful — you want to make meaningful comparisons. Comparing
General Motors to Ford or General Motors to the auto industry in general
makes perfect sense, but I’m not sure what you could gain from comparing
General Motors to Google.
I like to begin my analysis with a macro view of the world. I want to know
which equity markets are hot and therefore worthy of my dollars. One
advantage swing traders have these days is the ease of accessing equity
markets from all over the world. Many exchange-traded funds and American
Depository Receipts allow swing traders to gain profits from almost any-
where on earth.
Treating the world as your
oyster: The global scope
Because this book is targeted to swing traders, who frequently trade stocks,
the first step that I address in intramarket analysis is to explore which equity
markets are exhibiting strength globally. If you trade commodities, you
replace this step with an analysis of the major commodities versus each other.
The following are the major equity markets you should be familiar with and
can compare to one another:
(cid:2) Developed world
• The United States (S&P 500 Index)
• Western Europe (use iShares S&P 350 Index, symbol: IEV)
• Japan (use iShares MSCI Japan Index, symbol: EWJ)
(cid:2) Emerging markets
• Latin America (use iShares S&P Latin American 40 Index, symbol: ILF)
• China (use iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index, symbol: FXI)
• Asia (use iShares MSCI Pacific Index, excluding Japan, symbol: EPP)
You can analyze dozens of other individual markets using proxies such as
the iShares mentioned here (you can find proxies for the markets in Austria,
Belgium, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, and so on). But I like to keep things
simple and present only the major developed markets and the key emerging
markets.
The second step in analyzing relative strength between equity markets is to
construct a ratio chart between two different markets. When analyzing ratio
1111__229933668833--cchh0066..iinndddd 113355 77//2288//0088 66::5533::1100 PPMM

charts, apply the technical tools you pick up in Chapters 4 and 5. Look for
support and resistance ranges. Also, determine whether the ratio is trend-
ing (which indicates that one market is dominating the other) or in a trading
range (which indicates that both markets are achieving similar returns).
Make sure you read your ratio chart correctly. The first thing you should do
when you examine a ratio chart is determine whether a rising ratio means
market A or market B is performing well. Most charting programs clearly desig-
nate which market is in the numerator of the fraction and which market is in the
denominator of the fraction. (In the example shown in Figure 6-9, the numerator
market is designated by being charted above the denominator market.)
A simple rule of thumb is that a rising ratio means the market index in the
numerator of the fraction is outperforming the market index in the denominator
of the fraction.
Talk of numerators and denominators may bring back unpleasant memories
from grade school, so take a look at an example that helps bring the analysis
home.
Figure 6-9 shows the ratio of the S&P 500 Index to the FTSE/Xinhua China 25
Index as measured by the iShares security. This figure shows three charts.
The first chart is the actual ratio between the two indexes (S&P 500 divided
by the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index). The second and third charts are just
plots of the actual indexes used in the computation of the first chart. (Most
charting programs provide the underlying indexes used in the computation
of a ratio chart.)
This chart covers the two equity markets from March 2007 through June
2007. Notice that the ratio chart is declining in March (signaling strength of
China or relative underperformance of the U.S. equity market) but stabilizing
in May and June. However, a break below that support level on June 11 sig-
nals the resumed outperformance of the Chinese stock market over the U.S.
equity market. That break is a strong signal to buy the iShares FTSE/Xinhua
China 25 Index.
Intramarket analysis isn’t confined to equities. As a swing trader, you can
compare gold prices to the Commodity Research Bureau Index, for example,
to determine whether gold prices are outperforming other major commodi-
ties. Or you can compare the relative strength of the 10-Year Treasury Bond
to the 30-Year Treasury Bond. The combinations are endless.

Holding industry groups
to the market standard
Another application of relative strength analysis is to compare industry
groups to the overall market. According to William J. O’Neil, founder of
Investor’s Business Daily newspaper, industry group performance can explain
between 30 percent and 40 percent of a stock’s performance. When oil ser-
vice company stocks are hot, for example, shares of companies in the indus-
try will rise together. When Internet retailer stocks are out of favor, look out
below! These stocks will tend to go down together.
Why do stocks sometimes behave like a herd of animals? Well, think of it on
a simple level: If you operate a shoe store in Run of the Mill City, USA, you
probably experience sales increases or decreases in line with other shoe
retailers. If a hot brand comes out one year and propels your sales higher,
don’t you expect other shoe retailers to experience similar success? The
reason stocks in industry groups tend to behave in a similar fashion is they
face many of the same market forces in their industry: both the benefits and
risks. When the U.S. government spends more on defense, all defense com-
panies benefit together. One company may get a bigger slice of the pie than
another, but the entire pie is bigger, so other companies benefit. On the other
hand, when the government tightens its purse strings, expect to see shares of
most defense companies fall on hard times.

Par t II: Determining Your Entry and Exit Points: Technical Analysis
Industry group intramarket analysis (that’s a tongue twister!) compares indus-
try groups to the overall market. When the ratio between the two is rising or
falling, you can expect to find promising long or short opportunities from that
industry group.
You use the normal technical analysis tools from Chapters 4 and 5 on the
ratio. Figure 6-10 highlights an alternative energy index (clean energy) as
compared to the S&P 500 Index in 2007. A rising ratio in this chart means
that the alternative energy index is outperforming the general market. On the
other hand, a declining ratio implies the opposite — that the S&P 500 Index is
outperforming the clean energy index.
From late 2005 through mid-2006, the ratio of the clean energy index to the
S&P 500 Index was steadily rising. However, it experienced a sharp break in
May. This break of the trendline signaled that clean energy was no longer
outperforming the overall market. Instead, the break heralded the beginning
of underperformance relative to the general market that lasted for approxi-
mately eight months (not shown on this chart).
After you identify a turning point among an industry group and the market,
you can take advantage of that difference by either trading the index itself
(via a proxy such as an iShare) or drilling down into the industry group to
find trading candidates.
In the case of the example in Figure 6-10, you know that the clean energy sector
is underperforming the market. So now compare each stock in the sector to
the sector itself to find out which stocks are underperforming the sector.
This comparison will uncover a weak stock in a weak group, heavily pushing
the odds into your favor.

One company that fits the bill is FuelCell Energy (symbol: FCEL). Figure 6-11
shows a ratio chart of FuelCell Energy compared to the clean energy index.
The breakdown of the ratio in late May signals a period of underperformance
in the stock in relation to the industry. The industry was already beginning
to underperform the market at this point, so FuelCell is a prime candidate to
short: a weak stock in a weak group.

(cid:1) Comparing a company to its peers with relative valuation
T
o begin at the beginning (yes, I like things to be logical), 100 years ago —
if you’re reading this sentence before 2034 — Benjamin Graham and
David Dodd published a seminal work in the development of fundamental
analysis: a book called Security Analysis. It argues for determining the value
of a company by using its financial statements (specifically the balance sheet,
which shows assets and liabilities, and the income statement, which shows
profit and loss over a specified period of time). Later, John Burr Williams
wrote The Theory of Investment Value, which argues for determining a compa-
ny’s worth by discounting future dividends, or simply putting a future
value in today’s dollars. For example, $200,000 one year from now may be
worth $181,818 today, assuming the “discount rate” is 10 percent (that is,
investing $181,818 today and earning a 10 percent return yields $200,000
after one year).
Today’s investment models incorporate concepts from both these works to
assess corporate value. Valuation nowadays is the process of using data from
financial statements or comparable firms to assign a value for a company.
This chapter introduces you to the important concepts in equity valuation —
namely, what to look for in the companies you buy or short. I strongly believe
that it’s possible to estimate a company’s value within 10 to 15 percent of its
actual value in little time. The extra hours that Wall Street analysts put into
forecasting is largely to improve the precision of their estimates.
Whether you’re analyzing equities or another market, remember that you
don’t need an MBA or CFA designation to intelligently use fundamental analy-
sis. Following some rules of thumb and taking some time to understand a
company can go a long way toward improving your swing trading profits.

Getting Your Hands on a Company’s
Financial Statements
Financial statements can be pretty daunting documents. They don’t have any
pictures, and they’re written in pretty boring language (not like the hilarity
of this book). Financial statements really should carry some type of warning
label that says, “Do not operate heavy machinery while reading.”
To help you avoid the pain of reading minutiae that you’re unlikely to ever
need, I’ve broken down the financial statement puzzle into three broad
categories:
(cid:2) What to look for
(cid:2) When to look
(cid:2) Where to look
What to look for
Public companies are required by law to file reports with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) — a government agency that enforces secu-
rities laws — at least on a quarterly basis and sometimes more frequently.
The SEC filings you should be aware of, including filings that cover a firm’s
financial statements, are listed here. Even if you never visit the SEC Web site
(www.sec.gov) in your life — and that may not be such a bad thing — you
should be familiar with the nomenclature (fancy word for “words”) of the
industry:
(cid:2) 10K: Yes, at first glance the “10K” sounds like a marathon or perhaps
$10,000. But in fact, the 10K in this context refers to an annual report
companies must file with the SEC that contains a wealth of information.
The 10K contains audited financial statements, information on a
company’s history, lines of business, competitive information, manage-
ment’s expectations, and more. A company must file its 10K 60 days
after the end of its fiscal year. (A fiscal year usually begins January 1
and ends December 31, but some companies have fiscal years ending in
June, September, or other months.)
(cid:2) 10Q: The 10Q is a quarterly report companies must file with the SEC. It’s
shorter than the 10K and contains, most importantly, a firm’s financial
statements. Firms also may break out details on quarterly performance
and the reasons for an increase or decrease in earnings or sales. A
company is required to file a 10Q 35 days after the end of its quarter.

Chapter 7: Understanding a Company, Inside and Out
(cid:2) 8K: Companies file 8K statements after some material event occurs
in their business that they must alert shareholders to. These events can
be positive or negative, such as being acquired, entering bankruptcy,
acquiring another company, or failing to meet an exchange’s listing
requirements. 8K filings are very timely because public companies must
file them four days after the event occurs.
Concurrent with the release of earnings, companies conduct conference calls
to discuss the prior quarter. These conference calls also provide the oppor-
tunity for listeners to ask questions of the CEO, CFO, and other executives. If
you’ve never listened to this kind of conference call, don’t worry. You’re not
missing out on much. It isn’t a party, the jokes are dry, and the executives are
anxious to wrap it up. Listening to these calls is a necessity for long-term
investors, but not for swing traders (though it is useful). The time commit-
ment required to listen to several companies’ conference calls makes doing
so impractical.
When to look
As a swing trader, you must know when a company is slated to release its
earnings. You can call the company directly to find out its earnings release
date, or you can review its historical earnings releases (which typically go out
three months apart) to know when to expect the next announcement. Typing
a company’s stock symbol into Yahoo! Finance shows you historical news
items, including earnings announcements.
If you’re considering trading shares of a company, wait until after it releases
its earnings report because earnings announcements can cause major move-
ments in a stock price — up or down. Consequently, predicting whether a
company’s results will please Wall Street is difficult. Often a company may
report robust earnings with an unimpressive outlook that sends shares spiral-
ing downward. (Don’t forget that stocks tend to fall much faster than they
appreciate. Commodities, on the other hand, tend to rise much faster than
they fall.)
Fundamental data, unlike technical data, doesn’t change on a day-to-day
basis. Financial statements are at least one month stale, meaning a lag exists
between when a company files its report and the date the financial data is
reported. So some financial statements may be three months old, depending
on when you view the data. Corporate press releases come out on a more
frequent basis but are often immaterial. The big fundamental news days are
when a company releases its quarterly earnings.
Quarterly earnings provide traders with an update on the company’s opera-
tions. Often they include selected information from financial statements
(full financial data often isn’t disclosed until the company files its 10Q with
1133__229933668833--cchh0077..iinndddd 114455 77//2288//0088 66::5544::4477 PPMM

the SEC; see the preceding section). Quarterly earnings reports also update
traders on whether management feels comfortable with its targets or
benchmarks (assuming the company set such benchmarks in the past).
Where to look
Many moons ago, getting a company’s financial statements was a hassle that
involved finding the number for the company’s investor relations depart-
ment, calling to request an investor’s packet, and waiting for it to arrive via
snail mail. People often had to do a lot of legwork to get the information they
needed, so imagine how much work went into analyzing just ten potential
prospects! Back in those days, swing trading wasn’t really popular because of
steep commissions. Waiting days to receive financial information was yet
another barrier.
Fortunately, the Internet has changed all that. With the click of a mouse, you
have access to thousands of companies’ financial statements. The time it
takes to bring up a new firm’s financial statements depends only on how long
it takes you to type in that firm’s ticker symbol.
You can access a company’s financial statements by visiting the SEC Web
site (www.sec.gov), but it’s not especially user-friendly. A better option is to
visit Web sites that provide the information for free — and there are plenty
of them. The screen shots used in the financial statements throughout this
chapter come from Google Finance (finance.google.com), which provides
basic quote information, recent and historical news releases, charts, financial
statements, and corporate summaries. Yahoo! Finance also has excellent data
on a company, its industry, its expected growth rates, and more. Just point
your browser to finance.yahoo.com and type a symbol in the quote box.
You can get quotes, charts, corporate information, analyst coverage, owner-
ship, and financials on most any publicly traded
company.
Assessing a Company’s
Financial Statements
So what should you be looking for when a company reports earnings? The
most common question to ask yourself is: “Did the company meet or beat
expectations?” This guideline applies to both sales and earnings. The larger
the percentage beat, the better.
1133__229933668833--cchh0077..iinndddd 114466 77//2288//0088 66::5544::4488 PPMM

Chapter 7: Understanding a Company, Inside and Out
Expectations drive Wall Street. A big surprise can be a signal that analysts
aren’t accurately projecting a company’s earnings. A company that shows a
trend of rising earnings surprises (for example, a 10 percent earnings surprise,
followed by a 15 percent earnings surprise and a 20 percent earnings surprise)
often has superior price performance relative to the market. Conversely,
companies with negative earnings surprises have poor price performance.
Look for a surprise in the direction you’re trading. Consider the case of
Southwestern Energy Company, which exhibited a positive earnings surprise
of 7.1 percent in September 2007, 16.7 percent in December 2007, and 24
percent in March 2008. Between December 31, 2007, and April 30, 2008, shares
of Southwestern Energy rose 51.87 percent. The earnings surprise momentum
wasn’t the sole reason for the rise, but it provided a clue that something
positive was brewing.
Read over the quarterly earnings reports for hints on future performance.
Management may hint at problematic times ahead with words such as
“challenging” and “competitive environment.” These are signals that earnings
may not meet consensus expectations, and therefore you should carefully
examine major changes in debt levels, cash levels, cash flows (if disclosed),
and inventory levels.
The first step in analyzing financial statements is to understand their compo-
nents. Granted, financial statements may seem frightening, not to mention
boring. In my opinion, watching paint dry is more exciting than looking at a
financial statement. And that’s why this section isn’t an academic lesson in
accounting. Rather, I give you a basic understanding of what makes up finan-
cial statements and, even better, how you can view summaries on the
Internet. Wall Street analysts read through hundreds of pages of financial
statements before writing up reports on companies. Fortunately, you don’t
need to do anything close to that to be a profitable swing trader.
Public companies must issue four main financial statements each quarter. As
a swing trader, you need concern yourself with only three of them.
Balance sheet
A balance sheet is a snapshot of a firm’s financial health. Does the company
have a lot of debt? Does it have a lot of cash on hand? You can answer these
questions and more by viewing its balance sheet.
The balance sheet breakdown
The balance sheet is separated into assets (usually the first half of the
balance sheet) and liabilities and shareholders’ equity (usually the second
half). These two sides must equal each other. Academic textbooks often
1133__229933668833--cchh0077..iinndddd 114477 77//2288//0088 66::5544::4488 PPMM

present assets on the left-hand side of a page and liabilities and share-
holders’ equity on the right-hand side. In real life, expect to see liabilities
and shareholders’ equity below the assets section.
Assets are items a company owns that provide some future benefits — like
cash, inventory, and plants or equipment. They’re further divided into current
and long-term assets.
(cid:2) Current assets are those assets that are expected to be converted into
cash within one year. Items you’ll find in the current assets section of a
balance sheet include cash, inventory, and accounts receivable (credit
the company is expecting to convert into cash). You want to see that
a company has a good amount of current assets relative to its current
liabilities (which I get to shortly).
(cid:2) Long-term assets refer to items that are expected to be used for more
than one year. Expect to see items such as land, plants and equipment,
and long-term investments. There’s no good absolute number you want
to see in this arena. Some industries are capital intensive and require
lots of long-term assets. Others, like software firms, have few long-term
assets. Within the same industry, a firm that achieves more profits per
total assets is often valued higher than a firm that achieves fewer profits
per total assets.
On the liabilities portion of the balance sheet, you find items the company
owes others. Like assets, liabilities are divided into two categories: current
and long-term.
(cid:2) Current liabilities are expenses or accounts the company is expected
to pay over the next year (short-term debt, salaries, expenses, and the
like). You want a firm’s current assets to be at least 1.5 times its current
liabilities if you’re interested in buying stock in the company, and below
1.0 times current liabilities if you’re looking for a shorting opportunity.
(cid:2) Long-term liabilities are those items the company is expected to pay
back but aren’t due for 12 months or longer. Long-term debt is usually
the most important long-term liability. Compare long-term debt to share-
holders’ equity. Ideally, a company should have little long-term debt
relative to equity — say less than 30 percent. The more debt a company
has, the riskier the company is.
Finally, shareholders’ equity (sometimes presented as owners’ equity)
is the difference between total assets and total liabilities. This is what’s left
over for stock shareholders after meeting the obligations of debt holders.
Shareholders’ equity includes stock and the amount of earnings the company
has accumulated over time.

How to properly assess a balance sheet
You can develop a feel for a company’s financial health by looking at balance
sheets and surmising whether the company is in good, average, or poor
shape. Use these guidelines to help you:
(cid:2) Cash is king. The more cash a company has relative to its debts, the
better. The less cash a company has relative to its debts, the worse
off it is.
(cid:2) Compare current assets to current liabilities. A ratio of 1.5 or higher is
usually a sign that the company isn’t going bankrupt in the next 12
months. A ratio below 1 may signal real problems ahead.
(cid:2) Compare long-term debt to shareholders’ equity. The higher the per-
centage, the more leveraged a company is. Stick to buying companies
with debt levels below 30 percent.
(cid:2) Large increases in accounts receivable are a red flag. If a company’s
accounts receivable grow faster than sales, it may mean the company
is extending loose credit terms to increase sales. And that can spell
trouble if the company is unable to recover all amounts owed to it.
(cid:2) Large increases in inventory levels are a red flag. If inventories rise
faster than sales, the company may be on the cusp of a slowdown as
it works to sell off inventory. This problem is more pronounced in
the technology sector where inventory values quickly decline due to
industry advancements.
Figure 7-1 brings these concepts to life with the balance sheet of a publicly
traded company, Marvel Entertainment (symbol: MVL). Marvel owns the
rights to such popular comic book characters as Spider-Man, X-Men, Ghost
Rider, and the Incredible Hulk. Identify the key parts of the balance sheet:
current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities, and long-term liabilities.
(You won’t know every line item that appears in this example. Further
research can help you understand those items that I don’t cover.)
Glancing quickly over the balance sheet, you should notice that Marvel has
more current liabilities than current assets for the period ending September
30, 2007: $117.91 million versus $218.88 million. This fact is an immediate red
flag. If you were looking at Marvel as a buying opportunity, you might stop
here. The company has significant short-term debt relative to its cash levels,
and the situation is deteriorating as evidenced by the current assets to cur-
rent liabilities in the prior quarter: $165.89 million versus $195.50 million.
Something else that should jump out at you is the leverage Marvel employs.
Long-term debt ($218.56 million) relative to shareholders’ equity ($150.54
million) is an astounding 145 percent. This company is beyond leveraged!

The amount of research you conduct beyond the cursory examination pre-
sented here depends on the type of swing trader you are. More work can help
you make better decisions, but there isn’t enough time in one day to closely
examine several companies. For example, further research into Marvel
Entertainment would’ve revealed that the company has become so highly
leveraged because of its push into making its own films rather than licensing

its characters. But you can’t pore over hundreds of pages of SEC filings to
learn details that may, or may not, influence your decision to swing trade
the stock.
Income statement
The income statement shows a company’s profit and losses over a period
of time. That time is usually reported as 3 months and 12 months. The main
parts of the income statement are the revenues, gross profit, operating
income, and net income.
The income statement breakdown
“Revenues” is a fancy way of saying “sales.” In Europe, revenues are often
called “turnover.” Whatever term you use, this financial statement represents
a company’s lifeline. Without sales, you can’t make profits. Growth-oriented
companies can grow sales at double (and even triple) digit rates in times of
economic expansion.
After revenues, an income statement lists a firm’s gross profit (the amount
of profit left over after a company subtracts all direct costs related to the
products it sells — called cost of goods sold). An example best illustrates
these terms: If Dummies Corporation reports sales of $10 million in 2008
(due, no doubt, to the success of Swing Trading For Dummies), the firm’s cost
of goods sold would include the cost of printing the book, hiring yours truly
to write it, paying editors to proofread it, and more. These are all direct
costs. You wouldn’t include any indirect costs, like the salary of the CEO, in
the calculation of the cost of goods sold because they aren’t directly attribut-
able to the cost of the book.
Gross profit is often calculated as a percentage of sales. The higher the ratio,
the more profitable the firm. Often companies receive higher valuations
because of higher gross profit margins.
After gross profit, the next main heading in the income statement is the oper-
ating income. Operating income is what’s left over after taking out all indirect
costs from the gross profit figure. Indirect costs include selling, general, and
administrative costs. Marketing, for example, is considered an indirect cost.
The costs of electricity and office desks are also indirect. Subtracting these
items from gross profit yields operating income.
Finally, a few more subtractions are made from operating income to arrive
at net income — the bottom line. Subtract interest expense (like interest
payments on debt) and taxes and you get net income. Net income is usually
presented in dollars and as a per share figure. That is, companies divide
net profit by the number of shares the company has outstanding in order to
calculate income per share.

How to properly assess an income statement
Keep these suggestions in mind to stay on your game and spot strength and
weakness in income statements:
(cid:2) Compare sales growth rates (year over year) to net income growth
rates (year over year). Ideally, you want to see net income rise at a
faster pace than sales.
(cid:2) Keep an eye on the trend of gross profit as a percentage of sales.
A rising ratio is a healthy sign, whereas a declining ratio is a red flag.
(cid:2) Keep an eye on the trend of operating income as a percentage of sales.
Again, a rising ratio is a healthy sign and a declining ratio is a red flag.
(cid:2) Compare sales and earnings to year-ago periods. Comparing either
figure to prior quarters rather than the prior year may lead you to
incorrect conclusions regarding the company’s health.
(cid:2) Watch for growth in outstanding shares. This growth can be a red
flag that the company is issuing more shares and thereby diluting
existing ones.
Figure 7-2 shows the income statement of Marvel Entertainment for the three
months ending September 30, 2007, and the three months ending June 30,
2007. Identify the key parts of the income statement: revenues, gross profit,
operating income, net profit, and net income per share (earnings per share,
or EPS).
Marvel posted revenues of $123.64 million in the quarter ending September 30,
2007. Now, you may be tempted to say that number represents impressive
growth over the previous quarter, when Marvel posted revenues of $101.47
million. However, you shouldn’t compare quarters to previous quarters
because seasonality can wreak havoc. For example, a toy manufacturer
will experience a steep drop in sales after the holiday shopping season. To
maintain consistency, compare quarterly results with the results from the
year-ago period.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales basically remained unchanged from
the June quarter (at 85.7 percent) to the September quarter (85.8 percent).
(Comparing items that are a percentage of sales across quarters isn’t as
problematic as comparing sales or earnings across quarters.) Gross profits
as a percentage of sales are rarely this high, but Marvel receives licensing
fees, which have little cost directly associated with them.
Operating income as a percentage of sales also remained largely unchanged
(going from 53 percent to 52.7 percent). Marvel reported net income of $29.09
million in the June quarter, equivalent to 34 cents per share, and $36.27
million in the September quarter, equivalent to 45 cents per share. Marvel
has 80.52 million shares outstanding.

Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement tells you how much cash the company generated
(cash flows from operating activities), what it did with its cash (cash flows
used in/generated from investing activities), and whether it borrowed money
or paid out cash (cash flows from financing activities).
1133__229933668833--cchh0077..iinndddd 115533 77//2288//0088 66::5544::4499 PPMM

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
The cash flow statement breakdown
The first section of this financial statement details cash flows used in or gen-
erated from operating activities. It starts with net income and makes various
adjustments to tally up how much cash was generated or used during the
period — ending with cash flow from operating activities. What kinds of
adjustments are made? An increase in inventories reflects a use of cash
and therefore should be subtracted from net income. On the other hand, a
company adds back non-cash expenses taken out of net income in the income
statement. Non-cash expenses are costs a company recognizes on its income
statement that aren’t actually paid out. For example, if a company owns a car
used for business, it may recognize a $5,000 non-cash expense in one year to
reflect the car’s loss of value.
As a swing trader, don’t get too caught up in the details. The most important
item of this section is cash flow from operating activities — the bottom line.
This shows whether the company actually generated cash from its business
during the period. A company can report strong net income and have negative
cash flow if a majority of sales are on credit, for example. Look for cash flow
from operations to be consistent with net income (that is, they should rise
together and fall together).
The second section of the cash flow statement is the cash flow from investing
section. The most important item here is usually capital expenditures, or the
costs incurred to maintain, upgrade, or acquire physical assets. Generally, the
smaller the level of capital expenditures relative to sales, the better.
The third and final section of the cash flow statement is the cash flow from
financing activities section. This part of the statement shows any dividends
paid and any issuance or payment of debt or stock. Ideally, a company can
sustain its operations from the cash it generates internally, but sometimes
a company looks outside itself to fund growth. It may issue debt or stock
for that reason. Issuing stock dilutes the value of other shareholders’ equity,
and issuing debt may saddle the company with a debt burden that’s difficult
to bear.
How to properly assess a cash flow statement
Always look at a cash flow statement with these points in mind so you can
more easily spot a company’s strengths and weaknesses:
(cid:2) Compare cash flow from operations to net income. Net income rising
with cash flows declining is a negative sign. Falling net income with
rising cash flows may reflect a high level of non-cash expenses.
(cid:2) Keep an eye on capital expenditures (in the cash flows from investing
activities) relative to sales. The higher the ratio, the worse off the
company.

Chapter 7: Understanding a Company, Inside and Out
(cid:2) Look at the methods the company depends on for its cash. Does it gen-
erate its own cash from operations and not need to borrow money? Or is
the company issuing stock and heavily borrowing to make ends meet?
Answering “yes” to the first question is a good thing; “yes” to the second
question isn’t a good sign.
(cid:2) Look for major changes in the cash flow from the financing activities
section. A large amount of debt issuance may be a red flag. Payment of
debt, on the other hand, is a good sign that a company is deleveraging
itself.
(cid:2) Watch for large items or breaks in historical levels of cash flows.
Both can signal major events like an acquisition or payment of debt.
Paying down debt is generally a good thing, whereas acquisitions
can be good or bad. Unless acquisitions are a part of a firm’s strategy,
I’m often weary of them.
Check out Figure 7-3, the cash flow statement of Marvel Entertainment.
Notice that Marvel reported net income of $36.27 million in the quarter
ending September 30, 2007, but actually used cash in operations of –$8.68
million. Film production costs used up cash generated in the quarter. Marvel
is spending cash today in hopes of blockbuster films tomorrow.
Fortunately, capital expenditures were extremely low ($0.37 million) because
film companies don’t have a lot of physical assets that need to be upgraded,
maintained, or purchased.

Low capex may mean higher profits
Capital expenditures (affectionately shortened ratios. The portfolios are rebalanced each
to capex) represent investments by firms into December 31 using the last twelve months’
their businesses. So you may think that the sales and capital expenditures . . . those

Not Just Numbers: Qualitative Data
Fundamental analysis isn’t just based on numbers. A company is more than
its earnings, sales, and so on. Would you value a company led by a well-
known investor the same as a company led by your neighbor? Qualitative
factors also determine whether a company’s stock is a value or not.
Some qualitative factors that great performing stocks often share are

executives who run the company are putting their money where their
mouths are. The financial ownership also aligns shareholder interests
with management’s interests. A CEO is likely to think twice about taking

chunk of company stock in a 401(k) plan. The rule of thumb here is
that insider ownership of at least 10 percent of outstanding shares is a
bullish sign.
(cid:2) A wide moat: Hundreds of years ago, castles often used moats as a
defense mechanism to prevent would-be attackers from successfully
penetrating the castle walls. An economic moat is similar: It’s the degree
of competitive advantage a company has that prevents competition from
taking market share.
Warren Buffett, a well-respected investor and head of Berkshire
Hathaway, is a major proponent of the idea of economic moats. He
looks for companies that would be difficult to displace because of brand
loyalty or cost advantages. Moats are often established in the pharma-
ceutical business because of drug patents that ensure the developer of a
new drug will be the sole provider of that drug for a number of years.
You can see the world, to some extent, as consisting of companies with
wide moats and those with more narrow moats (called commodities) —
a product you can buy from anywhere and don’t care much about who
manufactures it is a commodity. Think of things like salt, sugar, or —
increasingly today — computers. Contrast the businesses that provide
these products with companies that have wide moats and are difficult to
displace. Starbucks — which Jerry Seinfeld jokingly calls “Five Bucks” —
is able to charge premium pricing for cups of coffee. Sometimes the
moat may be a result of some technological advantage. Google, for
example, was a tiny technology company in 1996 but developed a search
technology that dwarfed the behemoths at Microsoft and Yahoo! In a
short time, Google gained a major foothold in the search engine field and
was able to translate that market share into advertising dollars.
Ask yourself when reviewing companies how difficult it would be for a
company to displace the firm you’re examining. The more difficult it is
to displace, the wider the moat.
(cid:2) Positive catalysts: Catalysts help investors revalue shares upward.
Successful new products (like Apple’s iPhone) and new management
(like Hewlett-Packard’s Mark Hurd) are both catalysts that cause
investors to revalue shares.
A catalyst can also originate from outside the company. When one com-
pany is acquired or bought out in an industry, competitors of that
company often see share price increases as investors revalue shares
based on the purchase price multiple used in the acquisition. Investors
also often hope that another buyout will occur in the industry.
Negative catalysts that may propel shares of a firm downward can
include an earnings miss, a competitor’s introduction of a new product,
and the resignation of key management.

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
Valuing a Company Based
on Data You’ve Gathered
You may feel like you can charge people for advice on analyzing financial
statements, reviewing earnings reports, and evaluating qualitative data, but
just how much is this darn company worth? There’s no line on the financial
statements that says, “This company is worth $5 billion. Please do not pay
more than this amount. Thank you.”
If you get ten different analysts in one room and ask them to analyze one
company, you’re likely to get ten different answers (ideally they’re at least
close to one another). So there are differences in how investors value firms.
Understanding the two main
methods of valuation
The two main ways stocks are valued today are relative valuation models and
absolute valuation models:
(cid:2) A relative valuation model is likely the model you’ll use most often as a
swing trader. Relative valuation is estimating a company’s value based
on what its peers in the marketplace are trading at. The model may
be based on earnings (using the price to earnings ratio, for example),
sales (price to sales ratio), book value (price to book value), or a dozen
other ratios.
By far, the price to earnings ratio (P/E) is the most common method
of relative valuation. For example, if Macy’s and Dillard’s trade for 12
times earnings, then gosh darn it, maybe J.C. Penney should too. Maybe
it even deserves to trade at a premium to Macy’s because its earnings
are expected to grow faster in coming years than its competitors. Or
perhaps J.C. Penney deserves to trade at a discount to its competitors
because it has a lower net profit margin (net income divided by sales)
than its competitors. You get the idea.
(cid:2) An absolute valuation model is calculated independently of the
valuations of a company’s peers. Instead of drawing conclusions based
on what Macy’s or Dillard’s are trading, an analyst valuing shares of
J. C. Penney determines a value based on the company’s earnings, cash
flows, or dividends. Corporate valuation differences arise primarily
out of disagreements over expectations of future earnings. If it were
possible to know with certainty how much a company would make in
the next ten years, there would be little disagreement on the value of
the company today.

Chapter 7: Understanding a Company, Inside and Out
Relative valuation models are easier and faster to calculate than absolute
valuation models. Swing traders usually rely on relative valuation models
because of the complexity and time commitment inherent in absolute
valuation models. I address both here so you know that two basic methods
of analysis exist, but because this book is targeted to swing traders, I don’t
go into more detail on how to construct an absolute valuation model.
Implementing the swing
trader’s preferred model
Using the relative valuation model is the quick and dirty way of getting you
close to the actual value of a company you’re considering. All it takes are two
easy steps:
1. Choose your price multiple.
This metric can be P/E, price to sales ratio (P/S), or any of the other
metrics highlighted in Chapter 8.
2. Figure out what multiple your security should trade at for that
multiple.
Determining what’s a “correct” P/E ratio (or any ratio) is no easy task.
The best way to start is to look at the average P/E of the industry.
Then, decide whether the company you’re assessing deserves to trade
at a premium or discount to the industry. A company that can grow
earnings faster than its industry is generally awarded a higher P/E than
its competitors.
Figure 7-4 shows financial statistics of major drug manufacturers and the
average statistics for the entire industry. Merck (symbol: MRK) trades at a
premium to its industry on a P/E basis (24.58 times versus 21.31 times). But
that may be justified given Merck’s operating margins (operating income/
sales) of 25.22 percent versus the industry average of 14.53 percent. In
addition to Merck, this figure shows statistics for Bristol-Myers Squibb
(symbol: BMY), Pfizer (symbol: PFE), and sanofi-aventis (symbol: SNY).
Note: The acronym TTM stands for “trailing twelve months.”
A swing trader looking at Merck may determine that a premium valuation is
justified given the strength of operating margins and the recent quarterly
revenues growth versus the average industry. Coming up with an appropriate
multiple is more art than science. First determine whether the company
should trade at a premium, discount, or in-line multiple versus its industry.
If the company should trade at a premium or discount (because earnings

growth or operating margins or return on equity are higher or lower than
the industry average), determine an approximate size to the premium or
discount by measuring how much higher or lower the company’s growth or
margins are versus the industry. For example, a company growing twice the
rate of its industry may be worth a price multiple twice its industry average.
Alternatively, a company that’s growing at half the rate of its industry may
deserve to trade at a discount that’s half the industry average.
You can use other financial ratios to estimate the value of a company
relative to its peers. Remember to make higher or lower allowances for things
like profit margins, earnings growth rates, and efficiency ratios. Chapter 9
provides more details on how to determine a fair multiple. You may need to
award a company (with a higher multiple and, hence, higher valuation) if it
has strong earnings growth rates. Alternatively, a company with poor growth
rates or poor efficiency ratios may need to trade at a discount to its peers.

Y
ou can identify fundamentals-based trades (and technical-based trades
for that matter) in two ways: by beginning with the security’s market
and drilling down into the promising industries or by identifying candidates
with promising characteristics on a grassroots level. One approach is top
down, whereas the other is bottom up. Both ways have merit.
This chapter outlines how to identify promising candidates to buy or short
using a fundamentally driven top-down or bottom-up approach — and how to
determine which approach is right for you.
Seeing the Forest for the Trees:
The Top-Down Approach
The top-down approach identifies promising swing trading candidates by
starting with market analysis (looking at stock markets, commodity markets,
currency markets, and the like). Then it drills down into specific industries
before finally examining individual securities. This approach implicitly argues
for greater weight on markets and industries over the merits of an individual
company because these big-picture items are more important in determining
a security’s return than company-level factors. A top-down trader cares less
whether he or she swing trades XYZ Oil Company or ABC Oil Company
(based on the individual characteristics of each company) and more about
whether he or she is trading an energy stock or a drug stock.

==================================================

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
The top-down approach allows you to understand the condition of the
overall market, which is valuable because the majority of securities follow
trends in the overall market. For example, if the stock market is dreadful and
hits new lows every few weeks, you’re probably going to come up short on
your long trades. On the other hand, if you avidly short every stock that
moves while the market hits new highs, you’d best be prepared to take some
nasty losses.
Using this approach, you begin evaluating whether the overall market is
overvalued, undervalued, or just right. Then you question whether the indus-
try is likely to outperform or underperform the market. Finally, you look at
the individual security to see whether its statistics are impressive enough to
warrant investment.
Top-down analysis involves two specific steps:
1. Determine whether the overall market is correctly priced.
This step allows you to determine whether the overall market is cheap
or dear so that you know whether you should trade the long or short
side. As a swing trader, you don’t have time to call analysts, survey
government data, and build an economic model that perfectly captures
all information that may influence an overall market. Even if you did
have the time for all that, I’ve never seen proof that such complexities
improve forecasting abilities (my apologies to my econometrics
professor).
2. Assess the prospects of different industries in the market.
This step helps you focus on the promising industries or lagging ones
so that the wind is at your back when you buy or short securities within
that industry. If the market is overvalued, for example, which industries
present the most opportunity on the downside? Being right on the
overall market and wrong on the industry may leave you with losses.
The following sections break down the details of how to dig into market and
industry analysis to benefit from the top-down approach.
Sizing up the market
You can’t identify good swing trading candidates with the top-down
approach without first evaluating the overall market. Fortunately you can
choose from three measures to determine whether the overall market is
cheap, fairly priced, or expensive.
Just because a market is cheap or expensive according to these measures
doesn’t mean you should ignore price action. Ideally, price action should con-
firm the findings of these measures. When it doesn’t, you know something’s
wrong and that the current trend may end. For instance, these measures

Chapter 8: Finding Companies Based on Their Fundamentals
would’ve told you that the stock market was expensive or overvalued at the
beginning of 1999. But that didn’t stop the Nasdaq Composite Index from
nearly doubling during that year. The smart swing trader would’ve followed
the upward price action. But he or she would’ve kept tight stops in light of the
findings of these three valuation measures and, as a result, would’ve been
better prepared for the ensuing collapse of the Nasdaq in 2000 that took
prices lower by nearly 80 percent through 2002.
The models I present in the following sections are all yardsticks. They aren’t
to be taken as fact. Stock markets can be over- and undervalued for long
periods of time. But as a swing trader, you should know where value is. Even
if you trade in the near term on the other side of value, you’ll know whether a
trend has legs based on whether it goes against or with the direction of value.
For example, the bull market in technology stocks in 1998 and 1999 was
incredible and powerful. But it didn’t last long. Knowing that the market was
overvalued — as all three of these indicators would’ve told you — would
have prepared you for the major bear market that began in 2000 and ended in
late 2002.
Taking the easy path: Long-term P/E ratio
The long-term P/E ratio method of determining whether a market is over-
or undervalued is the crudest and simplest method you can use. It simply
compares the market’s current P/E to its long-term average. The real ques-
tion is: Do you look at the P/E based on the last 12 months of earnings, or do
you look at it based on the expected earnings in the coming 12 months?
Reviewing the expected earnings over the next 12 months makes more
sense than relying on historical earnings. After all, companies are valued
based on their future, not their past. Historical earnings are especially
unhelpful at points of inflection, where a major turn happens in the economy.
The recent past looks very little like the coming future.
Fortunately, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) publishes the P/E of the S&P 500
Index based on both historical and future earnings. The S&P Web site
(www.standardandpoors.com) provides spreadsheets that show the P/E
for the S&P 500 Index (large companies), the S&P 400 Index (mid cap compa-
nies), the S&P 600 Index (small cap companies), and the S&P 1500 Index
(the entire market). To download these spreadsheets, go to the S&P Web site
and click on these items in the following order: “Indices,” “Equity Indices,”
“United States,” “S&P 500,” and finally “Operating Earnings & Estimates by
GICS Sector.”
From 1936 through 2007, the average P/E of the S&P 500 Index — which
represents a large part of the market — has been 15.50 (see Figure 8-1). When
the market trades significantly above this level (say 20 times earnings), that
can indicate the market is overvalued. When the market trades well below
this level, that may signal that the market is undervalued.

Historical P/E Ratio of S&P 500 Index Average P/E Ratio
The S&P Web site breaks out data into two segments: as reported earnings
and operating earnings. I recommend you use the operating earnings spread-
sheet, because reported earnings can be distorted by one-time events that
aren’t reflective of a company’s underlying fundamentals. One-time events
that aren’t part of a company’s operations — like the gain generated from
selling land or the loss suffered due to a hurricane — can distort a firm’s
underlying strength or weakness. The operating earnings category ignores
these one-time effects and examines only those earnings generated from a
firm’s operations.
The long-term P/E ratio method has the following downsides when it comes
to valuing a market:
(cid:2) It ignores the other investment opportunities you can acquire. Stocks
are one asset class and compete with other asset classes, most often
bonds, for investors’ dollars. When bonds offer investors low returns —
say 1 or 2 percent — stocks tend to be valued at a higher premium to
their historical average. A P/E of 15 may be cheap when bonds are
offering investors a return of 1 percent. You can address this issue by
combining the long-term P/E ratio with a method that looks at other
types of securities, such as the two models addressed in the following
sections.
(cid:2) It may yield a result that won’t be reached for many months, or even
years. Take a look again at Figure 8-1. Between 1996 and 2000, the
market was overvalued based on long-term P/E but didn’t suffer a major
correction for a few years. However, the eventual correction was swift
and painful. That’s why you must use the long-term P/E ratio method in
conjunction with price action (that is, technical analysis) when deter-
mining how to swing trade in a specific market.

Chapter 8: Finding Companies Based on Their Fundamentals
(cid:2) It isn’t useful as a short-term timing vehicle. The P/E model isn’t a
short-term trading model and hence may hurt swing traders that depend
on short-term price movements. It tells you the direction the wind is
blowing, but sometimes the market ignores reality and marches the
wrong way. Eventually, the market gets it right. But in the near term, this
gap in accuracy may cost you a lot of money.
Solve this lag by incorporating charts with the P/E model. If the P/E
model indicates that the market is undervalued but the trend is
down according to the charts, don’t fight the tape. Instead, short the
security in question. However, be alert for signals of a trend change.
The near-term weakness may not be sustainable, and the market may be
due for a rebound. Similarly, if the P/E model indicates the market is
overvalued but the trend is definitively up, don’t argue with the market.
Go long, but keep tight stop loss orders to protect yourself when the
fundamentals prove out and the market takes a swoon. Be on the
lookout for divergences in technical indicators.
The major indexes may be going in one direction while the majority of stocks
are heading in a different direction. Believe it or not, the market indexes
can be led by a small number of securities. Indicators such as the Advance/
Decline Line or the New High/New Low Index can tip you off to a deteriorating
or strengthening market when they diverge from the major averages. (The
Advance/Decline Line and the New High/New Low Index can be plotted in
most major charting programs, such as TradeStation and High Growth
Stock Investor.)
Computing a “fair value” estimate: The Fed Model
The Fed Model compares the yield of the market to the yield of the 10-year
U.S. Treasury Note. So essentially it compares the return you may expect to
earn in stocks with a major competing asset class so that you aren’t examin-
ing stocks in a vacuum. As a result, you have a reference point from which to
base your estimation of the market’s current value. For example, when the
stock market is offering a higher yield than bonds, this model assumes that
investors will migrate to stocks. When bonds are offering a higher yield than
stocks, the model presumes that investors will flock there.
Here’s how to reach the point of comparison:
1. Determine the market’s P/E and calculate its inverse.
This number isn’t reported by most research providers. Fortunately,
you can find the market’s P/E on the S&P 500 Web site.
2. Calculate the inverse of the market’s P/E to determine the market’s
earnings yield.
The math is easy here. If the P/E is 12, calculate the inverse by taking 1
and dividing it by 12 (that is, 8.33 percent). If the P/E is 20, the inverse is
5 percent.

3. Find the yield on the 10-year Treasury Note.
You can locate this number online (try www.bloomberg.com/
markets/rates/) or you can look it up in The Wall Street Journal.
Suppose the P/E of the S&P 500 Index today is 15. That means the earnings
yield is 1 divided by 15, or 6.67 percent. For purposes of this example, say the
yield on the 10-year Treasury Note is 4.50 percent. Based on the Fed Model,
stocks are undervalued relative to bonds because the yield on the S&P 500
Index is higher than the yield on the Treasury Note.
Some swing traders take this model one step further to calculate what the S&P
500 Index should be trading at. The math is simple, but you don’t have to do it
to know whether the equity market is over- or undervalued. But if you want to
know anyway, check out the nearby sidebar.
One criticism of the Fed Model is that U.S. Treasury government bonds pro-
vide lower yields than other bonds. (The lower the yield, the more attractive
stocks look when compared to bonds.) U.S. Treasury government bonds are
considered “risk free” because the U.S. government has the power to print
dollars. Therefore, the U.S. government is unlikely to default on bonds it
issues. The yield, or return, on these bonds is lower than bonds issued by
states or corporations, which can default.
Improving the ol’ standard: The adjusted Fed Model
The adjusted Fed Model compares the earnings yield on stocks to corporate
bonds. But you can’t compare yields to just any bonds; different types of
bonds carry different levels of default. The higher the potential default,
the higher the yield the bond pays. It’s unfair to compare buying shares of
Coca-Cola to buying a bond issued by a troubled home lender likely to
default on its obligations.

Chapter 8: Finding Companies Based on Their Fundamentals
Rating agencies, primarily Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s, measure
the likelihood of a company defaulting on its obligations and assign rankings
to different bonds. S&P’s scale ranges from AAA (representing the highest-
quality bonds) to D (representing ready-to-default bonds). Moody’s scale
ranges from Aaa (highest) to C (lowest).
Figure 8-2 highlights a table taken from Yahoo! Finance’s Bond Center that
breaks down the different bond rankings assigned by S&P and Moody’s.
Investment-grade bonds, which many institutional investors are restricted
to, have ratings between AAA and BBB on the S&P scale and Aaa and Baa
on the Moody’s scale. These bonds tend to be higher-quality bonds and have
a low risk of default. Bonds that are below investment grade have a higher
frequency of default (often higher than 1 percent).
When using the adjusted Fed Model, you should examine the yield on 10-year
AA Corporate Bonds. These bonds are high quality, attract investment dollars
from institutional investors, and represent a competitor to stocks. The higher
the yield on corporate bonds, the less likely stocks are to be preferred over
bonds. But don’t just take the yield of any AA-rated Corporate Bond. Instead,
use a composite or average of all AA Corporate Bonds.
So where can you get this information? Fortunately, it’s provided free of
charge in this Internet age. Figure 8-3 shows a snapshot from the Yahoo!
Finance site that provides the yield on bonds with different ratings and matur-
ities (the term of the bond). Notice that the yield on 10-year AA-rated
Corporate Bonds is 5.60 percent.

Now that you know the yield on 10-year AA Corporate Bonds, you can
compare that to the yield on stocks. Suppose the P/E of the S&P 500 Index
is 19 today. That means the earnings yield is 1 divided by 19, or 5.26 percent.
Using the information provided in Figure 8-3, you know that the yield on
10-year AA Corporate Bonds is 5.60 percent. Based on the adjusted Fed
Model, stocks are overvalued relative to bonds because the yield on 10-year
AA Corporate Bonds is higher than the earnings yield on the S&P 500 Index.
As a swing trader, you should be alert for weakness in stocks.
As with the regular Fed Model, you can take this model one step further and
calculate a fair value (what the fundamental analysis measures say the index
should be trading at) of the underlying index by converting the yield on
10-year AA Corporate Bonds into a P/E ratio. A yield of 5.60 percent converts
into a P/E of 17.86. To calculate the fair value, multiply the P/E of 17.86 by the
expected earnings on the S&P 500 Index.
Assessing industry potential
Industries largely determine the profits of companies. Naturally, profits
differ between Dell and Hewlett-Packard, but even larger differences
exist between a grocery store chain and a PC manufacturer. Therefore,
take special care in determining the attractiveness of an industry using
fundamental characteristics.
You can identify which industries to focus on by looking at
(cid:2) Historical performance: Certain industries tend to shine when the
overall economy’s growing; others sparkle when the overall economy’s
contracting. Technology stocks, for example, tend to do well when the
economy is in its early or middle expansion period. Financial stocks

tend to perform well in late contraction (as the economy emerges from
a recession). For suggestions on how to find this historical information,
flip to Chapter 9.
(cid:2) Industry fundamentals: Just as you determine whether a stock is cheap
or expensive based on items like P/E, return on equity, and expected
earnings growth rates, so too can you value industries based on these
same factors. The two best places to get this information are Yahoo!
Finance (free) and HGS Investor software (paid).
Yahoo! Finance reports the following statistics on major industry groups
(data from biz.yahoo.com/p/s_conameu.html):
• 1-day price change: The percentage change of a security over
one day.
• Market capitalization: The value of a firm as determined by its
market price.
• P/E: A security’s price divided by its earnings per share.
• Return on equity: A company’s total profits during a year divided
by shareholders’ equity. This figure represents shareholders’
“return” on their investment.
• Dividend yield: Total dividends paid in a year divided by the
current share price. The dividend yield tells you how much return
you can expect to make from the dividend payments.
• Long-term debt to equity: Dividing long-term debt by share-
holders’ equity tells you whether a company’s capital structure
is heavily leveraged.
• Price to book value: Market capitalization divided by book value.
This figure measures how expensive or cheap a security is based
on its net assets.
• Net profit margin: The amount of profit a company can squeeze
out for every dollar of sale.
• Price to free cash flow: A company’s market capitalization divided
by its free cash flow during the last 12 months — or the amount of
excess cash the company generates that it can use however it
wants.
Price to free cash flow, which compares a company’s market price to its level
of annual free cash flow, is my favorite measure on an industry-wide basis. If
you’re looking to buy strong securities, search for industries that have low
price to free cash flow ratios — as long as they’re above zero. If you want
to short weak securities, seek out price to free cash flow ratios that are high
or negative. Negative free cash flow identifies industries in distress. Notice
that in Figure 8-4, the financial sector has the lowest P/E among the major
sectors — generally a good sign — but has a price to free cash flow ratio
that’s negative. This low ratio is a red flag that the earnings in the P/E ratio
may be inaccurate.

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
Figure 8-4 is a snapshot taken from Yahoo! Finance that shows various
fundamental measures for the major market sectors. As a swing trader, you
want to choose sectors with low P/E, low price to free cash flow ratios, and
high return on equity statistics.
Additional data sources such as HGS Investor software and the Daily Graphs
service of Investor’s Business Daily (both paid services) provide earnings
growth rates on a sector or industry basis. You should examine this informa-
tion because industries experiencing the highest earnings growth rates and
trading at the lowest valuation levels tend to outperform industries with low
earnings growth rates and/or high valuations. These specific vendors can also
assist you in identifying promising industry groups ripe for swing trading.
By using these fundamental criteria in conjunction with the economic cycle
chart shown in Chapter 9 (and on the Cheat Sheet), you can determine which
industry group is likely to perform best.
For example, look for industries with low price to free cash flow ratios that
may present compelling opportunities. Also look for industries with expand-
ing profit margins or higher-than-average earnings growth rates. Just make
sure that the price action of the industry is in harmony with the fundamental
measures. Otherwise, the apparent rally or weakness may be short-lived.
After identifying the strong or weak industry group you want to swing trade,
drill down into the companies that make up that industry to find the most
over- or undervalued candidate based on the Six Step Dance explained in
Chapter 9

sectors.
Starting from the Grassroots Level:
The Bottom-Up Approach
The bottom-up approach is starkly different from the top-down approach,
which I describe earlier in this chapter. Instead of beginning with the overall
stock market and moving to the industry group, the bottom-up approach
1144__229933668833--cchh0088..iinndddd 117722 77//2288//0088 66::5566::0055 PPMM

Chapter 8: Finding Companies Based on Their Fundamentals
places less emphasis on overall economic cycles by beginning at the com-
pany level and working its way up. If you favor fundamental analysis over
technical analysis or are trying to find promising long candidates in a weak
market (or weak candidates in a strong market), you may favor the bottom-
up approach over the top-down one.
The bottom-up approach usually begins with some type of screen, which you
use to identify promising long and short candidates. Some screens are very
liberal — they generate dozens of possible candidates, diluting the amount
of time you can spend on any one. Other screens are very conservative —
the criteria used are so stringent that you may have only five or six possible
candidates to evaluate. Think of using a fundamentals-based screen as sifting
for gold. A lot of garbage surrounds those valuable nuggets, and your job is
to find them amid all the trash. In the following sections, I show you how to
do just that.
Using screens to filter information
Fundamental screens can consider everything from earnings growth rates
to average daily volume to analyst estimate changes. Sometimes this variety
leads to information overflow, which may be discouraging if you’re using
a fundamental screen for the first time. Fortunately, because you create
your own screen using the criteria you want to focus on, you don’t need to
bother with the premade, too-much-information batches vendors peddle
to the public.
In addition to covering the general screening criteria to use, I delve into
two screens on the long side: a growth-oriented screen and a value-oriented
screen. I show you which criteria you really need to examine for each type
of screen in order to sift effectively. Note: These screens are for illustrative
purposes only to guide your development of your own screens.
Take advantage of both value and growth screens in your swing trading. When
growth is outperforming value stocks, use the growth screen. And when value
is what’s in, focus on the value screen. Determine which is in the lead by plot-
ting a ratio chart (explained in Chapter 6) of a growth and value index.
Figure 8-5 highlights the one-year and five-year returns for growth and value
stocks in the large (Russell 1000), mid (Russell Mid Cap), and small (Russell
2000) cap arenas.
Notice the striking differences in returns. Over the five-year period ending
December 31, 2006, the Russell 1000 Value Index (large cap value) generated
an annualized return of 10.86 percent versus the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s
1144__229933668833--cchh0088..iinndddd 117733 77//2288//0088 66::5566::0055 PPMM

(large cap growth) 2.69 percent return. If you convert the annualized return
(which is like an average return over the period) into a total return (how
much the index rose in total over the five-year period), the figures look even
more astonishing: The large cap value index rose 67.45 percent during the
five years while the large cap growth index rose 14.19 percent.

You can see why knowing which horse is in the lead matters. When value’s in
favor, as it clearly was during these time periods, swing trading value stocks
is like flying a plane with strong tailwinds. Swing trading growth stocks can
be profitable as well, but the headwinds lower your overall return.
In 2007, for the first time in seven years, the winds blew in the other direction
and growth stocks began to outperform value (see Figure 8-6). Whether this
change is the beginning of a trend or a one-off event tied largely to the melt-
down in the financial services sector (financial services make up the largest
industry weighting in the value indexes) remains to be seen. But keeping tabs
on these changes will place you in the right stocks.

Chapter 8: Finding Companies Based on Their Fundamentals
What you should know about basic screening criteria
Before you start working with screens, you should note that value and
growth screens tend to have similar characteristics. For example, both
screens should exclude low-priced securities and securities that trade infre-
quently. When looking for candidates on the long side, they should both
include a field for high return on equity.
A major difference between value and growth screens is that growth screens
tend to focus on earnings growth rate fields, whereas value stocks focus on
valuation metrics like P/E ratios. Additionally, some fields differ between the
two. For example, low-priced stocks are often identified using the price to
sales ratio. Growth stocks are rarely found using that measure.
Don’t be surprised if you see the same fields in both growth and value stocks
with different filter values. For instance, the return on equity criteria is
present in both the value and growth screens, because return on equity is
an important measure in all companies you buy or sell. The higher this
statistic, the more profit the company is able to squeeze out from every dollar
of equity.
When inputting your screening criteria, take care not to be on either the
liberal or conservative extreme. You want your screen to capture companies
from several industries, not just one that happens to be on hard times. If mem-
bers of one industry group dominate a screen, one of your criteria is likely too
strict. But you don’t need every industry to be represented to have a good
screen. When one industry is on hard times, then it may be understandable
that few, if any, members of that group appear in screens identifying potential
buy candidates.
When growth is on the rise
The important criteria to include in a growth screen include:
(cid:2) A share price measure: This number allows you to exclude stocks
trading below some value you input, such as $5 per share.
(cid:2) Average daily volume: This part of the screen helps you avoid securi-
ties that trade a few hundred shares a day and are thus difficult to enter
or exit. No doubt these securities hold opportunities, but I don’t believe
the potential return makes up for the risk.
Growth stocks typically reside in the technology, healthcare, and consumer
discretionary sectors, but they can reside in other parts of the market as
well. Following are the factors that characterize growth companies:
(cid:2) Earnings growth rates above the market average (for example, above
25 percent)
(cid:2) Sales growth rates above the market average (such as above 10 percent)
1144__229933668833--cchh0088..iinndddd 117755 77//2288//0088 66::5566::0066 PPMM

(cid:2) New products and new management
(cid:2) Low or no-dividend payment
(cid:2) High price to book ratios
(cid:2) Higher-than-average P/E
Use the growth screen when growth is outperforming value stocks. In con-
structing your growth screen, be restrictive enough that you have just a
handful of companies to work from, but not so restrictive that you exclude
potential opportunities.
Using a growth screen to find fast-growing companies
Growth stocks exhibit high earnings growth rates. Therefore, the following
growth screen, which can be implemented with most popular screening pro-
grams, focuses on earnings growth recently and historically. Although the
method of inputting these screening functions is largely dependent on the
screening program you use, I recommend you always input these numbers:
(cid:2) Last closing share price ≥ $5: I consider stocks below $5 to be penny
stocks.
(cid:2) Average daily volume (last 50 days) ≥ 100,000 shares: Unless you’re
trading $5 million or more, average daily volume of 100,000 shares with
securities priced $5 or higher should allow you to get in and out without
too much trouble.
(cid:2) Earnings per share (EPS) growth (most recent quarter versus year-ago
quarter) ≥ 25 percent: This is the figure recommended by William J.
O’Neil, founder of Investor’s Business Daily.
(cid:2) Annualized five-year historical EPS growth rate ≥ 10 percent: O’Neil
recommends this number as well.
(cid:2) Relative strength rating ≥ 80: Another recommended figure from the
Investor’s Business Daily founder.
(cid:2) Return on equity ≥ 18 percent: Based on my experience, 18 percent is
the minimum return on equity I’d look for in companies I want to swing
trade on the long side.
I consider these criteria to be important in growth stocks. The first two fields
ensure that you’re looking at liquid stocks that trade above $5 per share,
which excludes penny stocks from your analysis. The next two focus on earn-
ings growth rates: the lifeblood of the growth stock. The fifth field examines
price performance relative to the overall market. (Growth stocks that you buy
should be performing in the top 20 percent of the overall market.) The final
criterion, the return on equity field, limits your analysis universe to companies
that are being run well, meaning their earnings growth is driven by manage-
ment effectiveness and not necessarily by overall industry fundamentals.
1144__229933668833--cchh0088..iinndddd 117766 77//2288//0088 66::5566::0066 PPMM

==================================================

177
Chapter 8: Finding Companies Based on Their Fundamentals
You may notice that valuation metrics aren’t used in this screen. That’s
because growth stocks appear overvalued using traditional metrics like P/E or
price to sales ratio (P/S). These metrics can be incorporated, if you want, to
identify supposedly cheap growth stocks. For example, the previous screen
can be amended to add a criterion that the P/E of a screened security is less
than or equal to the P/E of the overall market.
Applying a growth screen when you want to short
If you’re looking for high-priced stocks that exhibit poor price performance,
consider using this type of screen. Many of the same criteria used in the pre-
ceding screen are the same. This one differs in that it looks for securities
exhibiting strong negative earnings growth rates rather than positive ones. It
also looks for companies with poor price performance (via the relative
strength rating). Finally, this screen introduces a new field called “Earnings
Surprise” to help you find companies that are disappointing Wall Street.
Companies often release poor news slowly, which creates a “drip drop”
effect. This is often found in companies with negative earnings surprises.
Following are the figures to use in a growth screen when you want to short:
(cid:2) Last closing share price ≥ $5
(cid:2) Average daily volume (last 50 days) ≥ 100,000 shares
(cid:2) EPS growth (most recent quarter versus year-ago quarter) ≤ –25 percent
(cid:2) P/E ≥ industry average
(cid:2) Last quarter earnings surprise ≤ –10%
(cid:2) Relative strength rating ≤ 20
The first two fields identify “tradable” securities trading above $5 per share
with average daily volume of 100,000 shares or higher. The third criterion
focuses on companies that have stubbed their feet — earnings growth was
negative in the recent quarter, potentially signaling a worsening profit picture
for coming quarters. But you want to short overvalued companies — and
that’s why the fourth criterion restricts your search to companies with P/E
ratios above their industry average. The earnings surprise criterion helps
you identify companies that aren’t managing Wall Street expectations well.
The final criterion indicates companies with poor price performance —
a prerequisite for identifying shares of companies that are likely to fall.
When value is in vogue
Value stocks are characterized by low valuations, first and foremost. Value
screens must home in on the valuation metric via popular statistics like P/E,
PEG ratio, or the price to sales ratio (P/S). You don’t emphasize earnings
growth rates or sales growth in value stocks. Although finding a company

with strong earnings growth rates makes a value stock that much more
attractive, don’t exclude a company for consideration (on the long side of
the market) just because earnings may not be growing rapidly and, in fact,
may be declining.
Using a value screen to find leading value stocks
A value screen is most helpful when value stocks are outperforming the
market. Value stocks are characterized by their industries and their valua-
tions relative to the overall market.
Here’s a value screen you may use to focus on promising candidates by
using the P/S valuation metric (remember, this is just one example, and one
I recommend — you should experiment and develop your own screen for
selecting securities):
(cid:2) Last closing share price ≥ $5
(cid:2) Average daily volume (last 50 days) ≥ 100,000 shares
(cid:2) P/S ≤ 1.25
(cid:2) Dividend yield ≥ 1.0%
(cid:2) Return on equity ≥ 18%
(cid:2) Relative strength rating ≥ 80
The first two fields restrict you to an investment universe that trades often
and above $5 per share. The next ranking restricts you to so-called cheap
securities, as measured by P/S. Value stocks often pay dividends, so I like to
see some dividend payout. But beware of companies that pay dividends of 10
percent or more. These companies are often distressed and about to cut
their dividend payments. Finally, the relative strength ranking helps ensure
you concern yourself only with securities performing in the top 20 percent of
the market. These securities tend to outperform the market in the near term.
Applying a value screen when you want to short
If you want to short value stocks, you can make some tweaks to the preced-
ing screen. Now, you’re looking for poor price performance rather than
strong price performance. You’re also searching for negative earnings
surprises — a sign that the company is disappointing Wall Street and may
continue to do so.
Following is the value screen to use when you want to short:
(cid:2) Last closing share price ≥ $5
(cid:2) Average daily volume (last 50 days) ≥ 100,000 shares
(cid:2) P/S ≤ 1.25
1144__229933668833--cchh0088..iinndddd 117788 77//2288//0088 66::5566::0066 PPMM

179
Chapter 8: Finding Companies Based on Their Fundamentals
(cid:2) Dividend yield ≥ 1.0%
(cid:2) Relative strength rating ≤ 20
(cid:2) Last quarter earnings surprise ≤ –10%
The first four fields are unchanged from the value screen on the long side.
These criteria narrow the universe of securities to actively traded value
stocks. The final two criteria, however, identify value stocks that have
faltered. A stock that sports a weak price rank (in the bottom 20 percent
of the market) is a sign that the firm has fallen on hard times or that the
valuation has gotten too extreme. A negative earnings surprise is another
sign that the company is no longer able to meet Wall Street’s expectations.
Assessing your screening results
After completing your screen, you need to have some kind of ranking system
so you can focus on the most promising candidates first and work your way
down. You can rank securities by their P/E ratios, for example, from lowest to
highest if you’re looking for swing trading candidates on the long side of the
market. Or you can rank securities by their return on equity or price to free
cash flow ratios. Ranking helps you push the cream to the top.
HGS Investor allows users to create “combo rankings,” which allow ranking
based on two or more measures (like 30 percent weight on EPS rank and 70
percent weight on P/E).
When identifying a promising swing trading candidate using a fundamental
screen, the right security should jump out at you. You shouldn’t have to do a
lot of equivocating or questioning. Here’s how to analyze your results:
(cid:2) If the security is one you want to go long in, verify that it exhibits strong
earnings, has a low valuation, and is in a well-performing industry.
(cid:2) If you’d rather short the security, make sure it shows declining earnings
growth, has a high valuation, and is in a poor-performing industry.
Deciding Which Approach to Use
Which approach should you use? As much as you may hate to hear it, this
question doesn’t have a right answer. The approach you choose is solely
dependent on your style of trading. Do you prefer to identify the ripe
industries that are poised to take off? If so, use the top-down approach.
Do you enjoy developing screens and then examining the filtered results
for promising candidates? In that case, use the bottom-up approach.

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
Fundamentals-based investors are usually bottom-up oriented. Swing traders
and technical traders are often top-down oriented. However, a fundamentals-
based trader can be top-down, and a technical swing trader can be bottom-
up. Remember: There’s no right or wrong way. The promising candidates
are the ones that you find regardless of whether you begin with a top-down
or bottom-up approach.
Ideally, a security you find by using the bottom-up approach can also be
found by using a top-down approach. But employing both approaches simulta-
neously is complex and time consuming. Choose one and stick to it so that
you perfect identifying promising industries (if you’re a top-down type) or
securities that are under- or overvalued on the grassroots level (if you’re a
bottom-up type).

nalyzing a company is kind of like going grocery shopping without a
shopping list. You can go to the store and look around for what you
want, but without having something in mind, you spend a great deal of time
walking through aisles trying to think whether you need more of this or more
of that. Taking a list along is much more efficient. You know what you need to
get and are less likely to be swayed by impulse buys scattered throughout
the store. (Why exactly are grocery stores selling DVDs en masse, anyway?
Are Americans now buying their favorite movies and their deli meats at the
same time?)
In this chapter, I clue you in to the Six Step Dance. Consider it your grocery
list of what to look for when analyzing a stock you want to buy or sell. These
six efficient, reliable steps aren’t set in stone. I didn’t pick them up from some
secret society that holds the keys to the “right” way to evaluate companies.
Instead, I offer you the process I use when looking at a potential investment
and how to tell whether this method of analysis is right for you.
The Six Step Dance: Analyzing
a Company
Forget the salsa or polka. The Six Step Dance isn’t a real dance. It’s actually
a way to look at a company’s fundamentals to quickly determine whether
shares are over- or undervalued. Table 9-1 shows you how the Six Step
Dance compares to three other analysis methods — forgoing fundamental

analysis, analyzing stocks via EPS ranking, and using extensive modeling in
Microsoft Excel — in terms of time efficiency, accuracy, and appropriateness
for swing trading.
Note: Time isn’t a luxury for a swing trader. Hence, the list in Table 9-1
isn’t exhaustive. You’re not going to have to call a company’s suppliers or
customers and inquire about their business operations. (I’m not even
sure how much outperformance such an exercise would really add to an
investment portfolio in the long run!)

modeling investors
If fundamental analysis isn’t your cup of tea, you can forgo it at your own
peril. Forgoing fundamental analysis entirely is time-efficient because it
requires no time on your part with regard to studying what makes a company
tick. But because you have no yardstick to measure with, you’ve no idea
whether the shares of a company you buy are expensive or cheap. This
approach is most appropriate for day traders. Day traders trade on news,
volume, and momentum. They pay little attention to a company’s earnings,
balance sheet, or competitive position in the industry.
Earnings per share (EPS) ranking is also time-efficient but with the added
benefit of being somewhat accurate when it comes to selecting securities.
Day and swing traders can benefit from incorporating EPS ranks into their
trading.
Extensive modeling is what Wall Street analysts do. They spend hours
poring over 10Ks, 10Qs, and other SEC filings and use Microsoft Excel to
forecast financial statements three to five years into the future. They call
competitors, suppliers, and end customers to understand how a company’s
products are selling in the marketplace. They even visit the company and
speak with management. The accuracy level’s high here. But as I show you
in Chapter 7, that doesn’t mean analysts draw the right conclusions in their
recommendations.
The Six Step Dance falls somewhere in the middle of the bunch shown in
Table 9-1. It’s time-efficient after you get up to speed on how to do it. The

Chapter 9: Six Tried-and-True Steps for Analyzing a Company’s Stock
analysis of your first few companies using this method is a slow process, but
you should be able to quickly review a company by using the Six Step Dance
before too long.
You don’t need to run through all six steps for every company that crosses
your desk. Many companies will fail one or two of the steps and be thrown out
of your trading idea box. You’re not an analyst with a deadline to meet for
your portfolio manager; you are the portfolio manager. Use your time wisely
and address all the key points before you enter a trade, and you’ll be able to
quickly go through a list of companies and exclude those that just don’t have
promising fundamentals.
Taking a Company’s Industry
into Account
A company’s potential profits depend on the nature of its industry. For
example, some companies require significant start-up costs to launch. Think
about how expensive it’d be to enter the commercial airline market. Today,
Boeing and Airbus make nearly all commercial aircraft. To launch your
own commercial airline business, you’d have to have billions of dollars to
research, design, produce, and market planes. The costs of entering the food
service business, on the other hand, are much lower. That’s why Tommy
from down the street can have a lemonade stand. These cost considerations
play into the economics of a sector, which determine how much profit
potential companies within that sector have.
The first step in your stock analysis is to understand the nature of the indus-
try in which a company operates. Peter Lynch, the legendary Fidelity fund
manager, quips in his book that he’d never invest in a company that can’t be
explained by a child with crayons. Similarly, Warren Buffett never invests in a
company he can’t understand, which is one reason he didn’t participate in
the technology boom of the 1990s. (Then again, he didn’t participate in the
crash of 2000, either. In fact, Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, actually
bottomed the same month the Nasdaq peaked in March of 2000.)
Swing traders don’t have to be so strict. I’m not asking you to buy crayon kits
or swear off technology investments. But understanding or having insight into
an industry can help you better trade stocks in that market.
The bottom line in analyzing the nature of a company’s industry is to follow
four steps:
1. Understand how the company makes profits.
Does it profit by selling a commodity or by selling business services?
The former is tied to the economy, whereas the latter may be
growth-oriented.
1155__229933668833--cchh0099..iinndddd 118833 77//2288//0088 66::5566::5500 PPMM

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
2. Determine whether the industry is growth- or value-oriented.
This way, you have an idea of whether valuations are average, above
average, or below average.
3. Find out what rate of earnings growth is expected for the industry
as a whole in the coming three to five years.
4. Determine which stage the economy is in.
Economic cycles affect sector performance, so recognizing the relative
strength or weakness of the economy at any given time is essential.
Scoping out markets you’re familiar with
Swing trading companies in industries you know can pay off handsomely. For
example, if you’re an avid gamer or have a child who plays video games, then
you probably know that the Nintendo Wii is scoring massive success and out-
selling its rivals. Shares of Nintendo rose 500 percent between 2006 and 2007
on the success of that console.
Not convinced? Consider the portable music player industry and then look
at Apple’s iPod. These puppies flew off the shelves from 2003 through 2007.
As a result, shares of Apple rose 1,700 percent between 2004 and 2007.
Don’t think that just because your time horizon’s measured in days or weeks
that you can’t benefit from trends that last years. A savvy swing trader buys
the dips of shares of super-successful companies like Nintendo or Apple and
sells the mania.
Identifying what type of
sector a company is in
Every company caters to a specific market sector. As part of the Six Step
Dance, you want to first identify whether the company you’re looking at falls
into the growth sector (characterized by above-average valuations and growth
rates relative to the overall market) or the value sector (characterized by
below-average valuations and growth rates relative to the overall market).
Following are the industries I classify as growth industries:
(cid:2) Consumer cyclical: This sector includes retailers, homebuilders, auto
and clothing manufacturers, cable companies, and other businesses that
cater to the general consumer.
(cid:2) Healthcare: Pharmaceutical and biotech companies, HMOs, and medical
instrument manufacturers are just some of the businesses that fall
within this niche sector.

(cid:2) Information technology: This market area is composed of software
developers and computer and semiconductor manufacturers, among
others.
(cid:2) Telecommunications: Cellular service providers, fiber optic wire/cable
manufacturers, and cellphone manufacturers are just some of the tele-
com companies you may encounter.
And here are the industries that I group into the value sector:
(cid:2) Consumer staples: This category is made up of businesses such as
grocery stores, food producers, beverage manufacturers, and cosmetic
companies.
(cid:2) Energy: Drilling companies, integrated energy firms, explorers and
producers, and equipment manufacturers all work within the energy
industry.
(cid:2) Financials: This market area includes banking companies, Real Estate
Investment Trusts (REITs), investment banks, insurance companies,
mortgage lenders, and so on.
(cid:2) Capital goods: Aerospace and defense companies, railroad businesses,
farming product and heavy equipment manufacturers, and others meet
the needs of this category.
(cid:2) Basic materials: This industry involves chemical specialty companies,
paper and steel manufacturers, and related businesses.
(cid:2) Utilities: The electric and gas utilities you use daily belong in this group.
Sectors perform differently depending on the economic cycle. Figure 9-1
shows the sectors that tend to perform best depending on the stage the
economy is in.

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
Companies in growth sectors usually earn higher P/E ratios than companies in
value sectors. Value sectors often feature companies that pay higher dividend
yields than companies in growth sectors. There’s no right sector to be in. If
anything, different sectors are right to be in at different times.
Be aware that market sectors determine firms’ valuations. For example, elec-
tric utilities aren’t known for their earnings growth potential. So don’t exclude
an electric utility from consideration simply because it doesn’t meet some
absolute level of earnings growth you specify. Analyze companies on a curve
based on their industry. Otherwise, you may be comparing apples and
oranges. A 15 percent growth rate for a technology firm can look amazing
when compared to a grocery store chain, but such a comparison isn’t fair.
Just because a sector is a value sector doesn’t necessarily mean that sector
can’t grow earnings at eye-popping rates. Consider the energy sector. For
much of the ’90s, the energy sector was a classic value sector with compa-
nies priced at below-average P/E ratios when compared to the market index.
But when energy prices began a magnificent climb early in the 21st century,
the energy sector transformed — temporarily — into a growth sector. So
seeing energy companies trading at 25 times earnings (a P/E ratio usually
reserved for high-growth technology companies) isn’t unreasonable, because
earnings growth rates are up significantly. But in the long term, the energy
sector is a value sector.
Just because a sector is marked as value doesn’t mean profits in that sector
will be less than profits in a growth sector. When growth is out of favor, value
sectors shine.

Determining a Company’s
Financial Stability

use to fund its own growth. This type of company has little or no debt on its
balance sheet and pays little interest to creditors. Without the burden of debt

on its shoulders, a fiscally sound company can seize investment opportuni-
ties more readily than a company dealing with massive debt.
But if you’re looking for companies that depreciate in value, financial instabil-
ity is your ticket. Such companies struggle to meet interest payments on debt
and may only make in profits a few times what their interest expense is for
the period. For example, Struggling Inc. may have such a major debt burden
that the interest on its debt is 25 or 50 percent of its total profits. If it makes
$5 million, it may pay out $2.5 million in interest on debt. This is the type of
company most likely to fail if business turns sour.
Whether you’re looking for long or short ideas, financial stability plays an
important role in selecting candidates. In the next few sections, I break down
the three ratios that can give you a quick feel for whether a company is
financially stable.
Current ratio
The current ratio compares short-term assets to short-term debts and mea-
sures how well a company can meet its near-term liabilities with its near-term
assets. This commonly used ratio helps answer the question, “Will this com-
pany have any difficulty surviving over the next 12 months?” Just because a
company has more near-term liabilities than near-term assets doesn’t mean it
has to file for bankruptcy. It can instead take out a long-term loan to meet its
near-term obligations, for example.
Financially sound companies have current ratios of 1.5 or higher. You can’t
draw any significance from a very large number, say 5 or 6. But when swing
trading on the long side, home in on current ratios above 1.5. On the short
side, consider companies with current ratios below that, because these
companies may be facing near-term pressures.
Debt to shareholders’ equity ratio
The debt to shareholders’ equity ratio (or debt to equity ratio for short) gives
you insight on how a company finances assets via equity and debt — referred
to as capital structure. The higher the debt to equity ratio, the more lever-
aged the company is. Two firms generating identical profits have different
efficiency ratios (such as return on equity, covered in Chapter 8) if they use
different amounts of debt.
Think of the matter this way: Two traders, Salma and Allen, begin the year
with a $50,000 swing-trading account. Salma trades throughout the year and
earns a 20 percent return on her account to end the year with $60,000. Allen,
on the other hand, decides to use a margin account, borrowing $50,000 from
1155__229933668833--cchh0099..iinndddd 118888 77//2288//0088 66::5566::5511 PPMM

Chapter 9: Six Tried-and-True Steps for Analyzing a Company’s Stock
his broker. He too earns 20 percent on his account. However, he ends the
year at $70,000 rather than $60,000. A 20 percent return on $100,000 yields
him $10,000 more than Salma’s 20 percent return on her $50,000 account.
Such a benefit can turn into heartache because leverage, the amount of debt
a company uses, can distort financial ratios. When all’s well, one company
may look more efficient than another. But when the situation turns sour, your
sunshine-filled day can turn cloudy fast. Had that 20 percent return in the pre-
ceding example been a 20 percent loss, Salma would be at $40,000 at year-end.
Allen, on the other hand, would be staring at a $30,000 account, a $20,000 loss
from his initial investment.
When you swing trade on the long side, look for companies that aren’t highly
leveraged. I prefer to see a debt to equity ratio no higher than 30 percent.
Some swing traders disagree with my viewpoint; they see highly leveraged
companies as having high profit potential. Although that may be true, such
traders are also exposing themselves to bigger potential losers.
Whichever view you take, realize that restricting yourself to low-leverage
companies may exclude some industries from investment. For example,
homebuilders are typically highly leveraged. I personally forgo such indus-
tries so I can sleep better at night.
Conversely, look for highly leveraged companies when you want to swing
trade short. Losses can multiply for such companies when business turns
down. I view a company as being highly leveraged when it has a debt to equity
ratio above 50 percent.
Interest coverage ratio
The interest coverage ratio measures how well a company covers the interest
payments on its outstanding debt. The quickest way to bankruptcy is to
stop meeting the terms of your outstanding debts, and the interest coverage
ratio tells you whether a company is in danger of falling behind on its interest
payments by comparing two figures:
(cid:2) A company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
(cid:2) A company’s interest expense
You compare EBIT because interest expense is viewed as part of the cost of
doing business. Hence, a company can use pretax money to make interest
payments. Check out the formula for the interest coverage ratio:
Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings Before Inteerest and Taxes (EBIT)
Interest Expense
1155__229933668833--cchh0099..iinndddd 118899 77//2288//0088 66::5566::5511 PPMM

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
Financially healthy companies should have an interest coverage ratio of 5 or
higher, depending on the industry. Again, the exact “healthy” figure depends
on the industry. But requiring a high ratio (when you’re trading the long side)
protects you if conditions turn sour. Financially unhealthy companies have
an interest coverage ratio of 2 or less.
You can pull both items in the interest coverage ratio from a company’s
income statement, but more often than not, you can obtain the ratio for free
from a Web site. I recommend the finance section of Reuters for a summary of
key ratios on thousands of publicly traded stocks (see www.reuters.com/
finance). This site also compares the financial ratios of one company to
its industry’s ratios to help you determine whether a company’s interest
coverage or debt levels are in line with its industry.
Want an example of how you can use the interest coverage ratio? As you
can see in Figure 9-2, Toll Brothers, a homebuilder, has an interest coverage
ratio of 3.55, below my threshold of 5. Notice also that Toll Brothers’s inter-
est coverage ratio is well below its industry and sector. These factors rein-
force the view that the company is experiencing near-term difficulties. If you
were looking to swing trade Toll Brothers on the long side, this chart should
convince you to consider other companies. Alternatively, this chart may be
a sign that Toll Brothers is worth pursuing if you’re looking for a short
candidate.

You’ve heard it a dozen times: Past performance isn’t indicative of future
results. But don’t tell that to Patrick Henry, the American revolutionary

to analyzing companies’ fundamentals: “I have no way of judging the future
but by the past.”

Chapter 9: Six Tried-and-True Steps for Analyzing a Company’s Stock
Analyzing a company’s historical sales and earnings is the third part of the
Six Step Dance. You must look at a company’s historical record in order to
determine a trend. If a company is losing market share or suffering from com-
petition, that weakness shows up in sales and/or earnings. If a company is
gaining market share and ramping up production, that also appears in sales.
Here’s how to conduct a good analysis of historical earnings and sales growth:
1. Examine a company’s sales and earnings growth over the last several
years.
2. Get a feel for whether the company is mature (growing sales and
earnings at a low rate) or growing (increasing both sales and earnings
at double digits).
3. Compare growth rates across the industry so you know whether
the company deserves to be awarded a higher multiple than its
competition.
Avoid companies with negative sales or earnings growth if you’re going
long. Steer clear of companies with positive sales or earnings growth if
you’re going short.
Fortunately, this analysis can be done visually (after all, a picture’s worth a
thousand words) or quantitatively. Relax, you don’t have to acquaint yourself
with another formula on what constitutes good or poor results. Regardless of
the direction of growth, a company may be over- or undervalued depending
on what market multiple it trades at or what cash flow it generates.
If a company’s experiencing growth, you need to figure out whether that
growth is accelerating, slowing down, or holding steady. A company under-
going accelerated growth is often awarded a market multiple above its
industry — as long as that growth outpaces the industry average. On the other
hand, a company facing declining earnings or sales — at a time when the
industry is growing — is often awarded a market multiple below its industry.
Be sure to review at least three years’ worth of sales and earnings growth.
William J. O’Neil of Investor’s Business Daily recommends looking for compa-
nies with an earnings growth rate of at least 25 percent in the previous two
quarters (when compared to the year-ago periods) and an annual earnings
growth rate of 25 percent throughout the last three years.
I certainly like to see such growth in the companies I’m looking to swing
trade on the long side. But I don’t exclude a company solely because it
doesn’t have that minimum 25 percent earnings growth rate. My yardstick is
to find companies growing earnings at a faster pace than the industry.
Earnings growth can’t continue indefinitely if sales remain constant. The
type of sales growth I look for depends on a company’s size. The larger the
company, the more I allow for lower levels of sales growth. Growing sales 25
percent when total sales are $10 million is much easier to do than growing
sales 25 percent when total sales are $10 billion.

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
On the short side, you want to see deterioration in both sales and earnings.
A company losing market share is often reluctant to admit its position until
after everyone knows. Accelerating weakness is especially bearish because
the extent of the decline is unknown until it flattens out. And even then,
there’s no guarantee it’ll rise again.
Examining both sales and earnings pays off. Consider the income statement
of Vonage (symbol: VG) from 2002 through 2006. During that period, Vonage
grew sales from $1 million to $607 million — now that’s remarkable growth!
So surely Vonage was a steal to buy, right? Not when you look at the bottom
line: net income. During that same period, Vonage’s losses increased from
$13 million to $339 million, and the company’s stock price fell from $17 per
share when the stock was issued in 2006 to $2 per share by the end of 2007,
as shown in Figure 9-3.

Understanding Earnings
and Sales Expectations
Wall Street values companies based on future income projections, not past
income results. So another critical step in your stock analysis is examining
what a company is likely to earn in the future.

Chapter 9: Six Tried-and-True Steps for Analyzing a Company’s Stock
The good news is that a “right” figure for future growth simply doesn’t exist.
A company can report an earnings growth rate of 100 percent during a
quarter versus the year-ago period and still see its stock price tumble like
there’s no tomorrow — if Wall Street expected 150 percent earnings growth.
For better or worse, Wall Street analysts estimate a company’s future earnings
and sales by meeting with management, talking to competitors, building
elaborate models only they can understand, and flipping a coin. (I’m only half
joking.) Analysts often estimate earnings in the same range to avoid the
embarrassment that comes if an estimate’s far off the market. After all, if
they’re wrong together, they have an excuse. But if one analyst is way off and
everyone else is on target, that analyst may have some explaining to do. But
you don’t have to go through all that trouble. Instead, you can let the analysts
do the heavy lifting to give you a ballpark figure from which you can work.
Talk about a home run!
Whenever you use analysts’ estimates, you want to know whether they can
give you an idea of a company’s sales or earnings trend. (Is it rising or falling?
Is it increasing or decreasing?) That’s why I recommend using these so-called
expert estimates in conjunction with the history of a company’s earnings
surprises.
The earnings surprise history helps you determine whether the analysts over-
anchored their analysis. Anchoring is a behavioral finance term that refers to
an individual’s tendency to anchor beliefs on some reference point. For exam-
ple, analyst Martha may believe that Dell is the undisputed PC seller in the
world. But when Dell announces a lousy quarter and Hewlett-Packard — a
chief rival to Dell — reports an excellent one, analyst Martha may be tempted
to retain her old belief that Dell is still the leader and may have just stumbled
temporarily. It may take three or four quarters of results before analyst
Martha finally catches onto the trend and adjusts her models to reflect the
new reality — perhaps just before the trend changes again!
An earnings surprise history table compares a firm’s actual reported earnings
to the consensus (or average) estimate of Wall Street. A company that reports
earnings of $1.10 per share when Wall Street expected earnings of $1.00 per
share surprises Wall Street by 10 cents per share, or 10 percent. Some Web
sites (like the finance section of Reuters) report the absolute difference
between the actual results and the estimates, whereas others (like Yahoo!
Finance) report the actual and percentage difference.
Earnings surprise histories are extremely important in swing trading.
Because earnings estimates represent Wall Street’s consensus estimates
on sales and earnings going forward, the consistent over- or underestimating
of sales or earnings is very telling. An inconsistent pattern has little
significance.
When analyzing Wall Street’s estimates of earnings and sales, practice the
following:

1. Determine the trend and the slope of the trend.
For example, is the slope increasing or decreasing?
2. Examine the earnings surprise history.
You want to see whether analysts are consistently underestimating
(positive surprises) or overestimating (negative surprises) a company’s
sales and earnings.
Although seeing increasing or decreasing surprises (depending on
whether you want to go long or short) is great, don’t place that require-
ment on the earnings surprise history, because doing so is somewhat
burdensome.
Figure 9-4 shows the earnings and sales surprise history of Merck Company
(symbol: MRK) over five quarters: September 2006 through September 2007.
Notice how analysts consistently underestimated sales (and earnings, to a
lesser extent) throughout the five quarters. This consistent underestimation
is a clue that shares of Merck are probably mispriced. Shares of Merck
returned more than 32 percent in 2007.

Checking Out the Competition
No company is an island. It competes with other firms in its industry.
Understanding who the other players are and their fundamentals gives you
insight on whether shares you’re trading are cheap or dear. That’s why
you always want to examine a company’s competitors and understand how
they differ from it.
Companies in the same industry tend to benefit and suffer together, because
the forces that affect all firms in an industry are usually the same. The key is
understanding how the firms within the industry differ.

Chapter 9: Six Tried-and-True Steps for Analyzing a Company’s Stock
This essential part of the Six Step Dance is all about classifying the way in
which the company you’re swing trading is distinguishing itself. You can
generally sort a company’s stand-out-from-the-pack strategy into one of
these four bins:
(cid:2) Cost-leadership strategy: The cost-leadership company strives to be the
lowest-cost producer in the industry. Often, it achieves this status by
employing economies of scale or by being large enough to spread costs
across a broad number of items in order to lower prices. Of course, the
cost leader’s products must be similar to higher-priced products in the
market. No cost leader can simply offer cheap items that are clearly infe-
rior to what consumers can purchase elsewhere. Good examples of cost
leaders are Wal-Mart and Southwest Airlines.
(cid:2) Differentiator strategy: A differentiator strives to offer a better product
than others in its industry and usually charges a premium price for that
product. Tiffany & Co. is a classic differentiator company.
(cid:2) Cost-focus strategy: A company pursuing a cost-focus strategy tries to
offer the lowest prices on a narrow part of the industry. A company that
manufactures cheap memory for PCs, for example, practices cost focus.
(cid:2) Differentiator-focus strategy: A company pursuing a differentiator focus
attempts to offer a superior product in some aspect of quality for a
narrow subset of the market. NVIDIA, a premium graphics chip maker,
employs the differentiator-focus strategy by offering graphics cards
aimed at gamers and graphic designers.
You can sometimes tell which strategy a company is pursuing by examining
three key profit margins: gross profit margins, operating margins, and net
profit margins. If a company can charge a premium price for its products, it
tends to earn higher margins (on all three measures) than its competitors.
(Flip to Chapter 7 for a refresher on profit margins.)
Figure 9-5 shows a competitor analysis of four companies in the computer
industry: Apple Inc. (symbol: AAPL), Dell Computer (symbol: DELL), Hewlett-
Packard (symbol: HPQ), and Microsoft (symbol: MSFT). Because Microsoft
isn’t a computer manufacturer, its comparisons aren’t as meaningful as the
other three companies. But I’m going to take a look at the following anyway
to determine which strategy each company is following:
(cid:2) Gross margins: Apple and Microsoft have the highest gross margins of
the lot at 33.97 percent and 78.41 percent, respectively. Microsoft is a
software firm with lower production costs, which is why its gross
margin is so much higher than the rest of the companies in this analysis.
But you can immediately tell that both Apple and Microsoft are charging
more for their products than Dell or Hewlett-Packard. This move is
consistent with a differentiator strategy.

Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
(cid:2) Operating margins: Apple and Microsoft also have higher operating
margins than the other competitors at 18.37 percent and 37.87 percent,
respectively.
(cid:2) Net profit margins: This table doesn’t explicitly list the net profit
margins of the four companies, but it does provide sufficient data to
calculate these margins. (Remember: Net profit margins are equal
to net income divided by sales. Of the three margins listed here, net
profit margins are the most important.) If you calculate the net profit
margins for the four companies, you find that Apple and Microsoft
have the highest of the bunch at 14.58 percent and 27.52 percent,
respectively.
Pay close attention to profit margins, especially relative profit margins. The
Motley Fool Web site (www.fool.com) recommends buying stocks of compa-
nies with net profit margins of 10 percent or more. I agree with this rule as a
generality, but you should recognize that different industries have different
forces that may inhibit a company from realizing such high margins.

Chapter 9: Six Tried-and-True Steps for Analyzing a Company’s Stock
Valuing a Company’s Shares
Valuing a company’s shares may be the single most important part of the
Six Step Dance. Although you can value a company in several extensive
ways, this step focuses on relative valuation models, which are the poor
man’s valuation choice (perhaps that’s a poor choice of words — oops! that
too). A relative model doesn’t answer the question, “How much is this
company worth to the penny?” Instead, it answers the question, “Relative to
its competitors, are shares of this company properly valued?”
So to end your stock analysis dance with high marks (and a wealth of knowl-
edge to make the right decision for your swing trading), here’s what to do:
1. Gauge whether shares of the company you want to swing trade are
cheap or expensive relative to that company’s competitors.
2. Analyze whether the relative cheapness or expensiveness is justified
by reviewing expected earnings growth rates.
I break down the nitty-gritty of these two essential steps in the next couple
sections.
Gauging shares’ relative cheapness
or expensiveness
Determining whether the shares of a company you’re looking to swing trade
are cheap or expensive relative to its competitors is essential. Realize that
this question is different than asking what the market capitalization of the
company is. Just because a company’s worth $10 billion doesn’t mean it’s
more expensive, on a relative basis, than a company worth $1 billion. The $10
billion company may be cheaper, for example, when earnings are compared
at market value.
So how do you go about figuring out this relative value? By using the most
accessible valuation metric — the price to earnings ratio (P/E) — in combina-
tion with other popular ratio metrics such as price to sales (P/S), price to cash
flow, and PEG (P/E divided by the expected earnings growth rate). Each ratio
has its pros and cons, which is why you need to use more than one when valu-
ing a company.
Time to meet the ratio tools in your valuation toolbox:

==================================================

198
Part III: Digging Deeper into the Market: Fundamental Analysis
(cid:2) P/E: Calculate P/E by dividing a firm’s share price by the trailing 12
months of earnings per share. A forward P/E is a firm’s share price
divided by the expected earnings per share in the coming 12 months.
P/E is a popular metric because earnings drive market prices.
P/E can easily be distorted on the positive or negative side. For example,
a company may take a large one-time charge, which lowers its earnings
per share temporarily. If you don’t back that charge out, you may value
shares of the company incorrectly. That’s why you should always try
multiple valuation techniques.
(cid:2) Price to cash flow: I consider this ratio the most important one after
P/E. Cash flow, like sales, is difficult to manipulate through accounting
shenanigans. This ratio divides the market capitalization of a company
by trailing 12 month cash flows (taken from the cash flow statement,
which I cover in Chapter 7).
(cid:2) PEG: Also known as the price/earnings to growth ratio, this is the only
ratio that incorporates a firm’s growth rate into its calculation. I rank
PEG closely behind the price to cash flow measure. You can calculate it
by dividing a firm’s P/E by its annual EPS growth rate. A company trad-
ing at 20 times earnings but growing earnings at 30 percent per year
would sport a PEG of 0.67.
(cid:2) P/S: The P/S helps you value a company that doesn’t have earnings.
This ratio is equal to a company’s market capitalization divided by total
sales. Like P/E, P/S is widely reported. Sales are more difficult to manipu-
late than earnings (U.S. accounting rules notwithstanding), but they
aren’t a helpful metric if a company’s unable to translate them into
earnings. For example, Vonage Holdings (look back at Figure 9-3) had a
superb P/S that kept on getting better because the company grew sales
while it bled losses.
Use P/S sparingly and always within a single industry.
For all four ratios, know that the lower the number, the cheaper the stock.
Figuring out whether the comparative
share-price difference is justified
After you know how cheap or expensive a company’s stock is based on the
four common valuation metrics (see the preceding section for details), you’re
ready to determine whether that relative cheapness or expensiveness is justi-
fied. Peter Lynch, the legendary fund manager, posits that a company should
trade for a similar rate as its P/E. A company growing earnings 15 percent, for
example, deserves to trade at 15 times earnings.

Chapter 9: Six Tried-and-True Steps for Analyzing a Company’s Stock
I agree with this postulation. You can determine a company’s growth rate by
examining expected earnings growth rates. Just consider the case of popular
search engine company Google (symbol: GOOG), which has been one of the
hardest companies to value. Every new high it made was followed by calls
from analysts saying that shares simply couldn’t go any higher. But guess
what? Shares of Google rose some more!
Could you have swing traded Google shares on the long side using a valua-
tion technique that called for shares of Google to trade at roughly the same
level of its growth rate? At the end of 2007, Google’s shares traded for 50
times earnings. Meanwhile, the industry traded at 40 times earnings. With
such a premium, shares of Google must be overvalued, right?
Not necessarily. Figure 9-6 provides a snapshot of Google’s fundamentals at
the end of 2007 (all data used in this description has been circled). Although
Google’s P/E is 24.6 percent higher than the industry’s P/E, Google’s histori-
cal sales growth is 45.8 percent higher than the industry’s. Also, Google’s
historical EPS growth is 23 percent higher than its industry. By those mea-
sures, Google doesn’t look expensive relative to its industry. Analysts
estimate that Google’s earnings per share will grow 33 percent annually
throughout the next five years. If that’s true, Google’s shares should trade
at 33 times earnings, all else being equal.

See, that’s not so hard! But you don’t have to go on earnings or sales
estimates alone to peg a company’s relative value. You should also look at
a company’s financial position, net profit margins, and return on equity
relative to its industry. If a company trades for the average P/E or price to
cash flow ratio of its industry but is achieving

f you’ve ever seen the popular 1984 film The Karate Kid starring Ralph
Macchio and Pat Morita, you may already know why this chapter is the
most important in this book. In the film, karate master Mr. Miyagi teaches the
timid teenager Daniel Larusso martial arts. But instead of beginning Larusso’s
training with how to throw a right hook or how to do a round kick, Miyagi
stresses defensive techniques. “Wax on, wax off,” he tells his student. The
lesson is that you must block your opponents’ punches and kicks or you
won’t last very long in a fight.
Believe it or not, swing trading isn’t that different (fortunately, there’s no
need to train by waxing cars). I believe that the biggest determining factor
of whether you’ll be successful as a swing trader is how well you’re able to
implement your own risk management system. All too often, managing risk
gets relegated to one or two simple rules of thumb: diversify your holdings
and limit your investment in a single security, and all should be merry. Au
contraire — although diversification and position sizing are important parts
of risk management, they don’t encompass all features of it. Moreover, trad-
ers often fail to fully implement diversification and position sizing correctly.
Managing risk is threefold: limiting the risk from a single position, limiting
the risk on the portfolio level, and executing the orders your risk system
tells you to execute. The first two can be taught to a five-year-old, but the
practice of following your risk system is more difficult. As a swing trader, you
have no one behind you making sure you follow these rules, and that means
you’re literally your worst enemy. If you get sloppy and ignore a rule here or
there, you may get away with it a few times, but eventually the market will
punish you.

Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
Risk Measurement and Management
in a Nutshell
Trading in general can be very deceptive — things aren’t always as they
appear. A hotshot trader or portfolio manager may post tremendous returns
year-in and year-out, but if that trader or manager doesn’t manage risk well,
he or she may be one day away from blowing up and losing everything.
Risk management is the science (and sometimes the art) of limiting the losses
your portfolio may suffer. This chapter breaks down limiting risk into two
components: limiting the risk of an individual security and limiting risk at a
portfolio level.
Fortunately, you can limit the potential losses of your portfolios by following
several rules, which this chapter discusses in detail:
(cid:2) Limit the amount of capital you invest in a position (position sizing)
(cid:2) Invest in securities that trade frequently (liquidity)
(cid:2) Spread out your capital over several positions (diversification)
(cid:2) Spread out your capital over different sectors (diversification)
Risk management is how you put these various methods together into a
coherent strategy. Before you buy or sell a stock, you must have written
rules on how you’ll respond should that trade go sour. That’s your risk
strategy. But that doesn’t mean you won’t experience losses. All professional
(and great) traders lose money. What separates the successful ones from the
burnouts are those who manage their risk well.
You have to be humble when you invest in the financial markets; you can’t
ever think you’re smarter than the market. The minute you think that is the
same minute your proverbial head will be handed to you on a silver platter.
First Things First: Measuring the
Riskiness of Stocks before You Buy
Before you can manage the riskiness of your portfolio, you need to measure
the riskiness of the stocks you’re considering. So just how can you measure
the riskiness of an individual stock? There are a number of factors to con-
sider, all of which can give you an idea how much a security’s share price
may move in the near term:

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
(cid:2) The stock’s beta, which is the risk of a stock compared to a market:
Beta is often overlooked by individual traders and has more weight with
institutional traders. Although beta is backward-looking (that is, the
historical volatility doesn’t necessarily mean a stock or security will be
as volatile in the future), you should know a security’s beta in order to
get an idea of how it has historically traded relative to the market.
(cid:2) The stock’s liquidity, or how frequently traders exchange the securi-
ty’s shares: Liquidity refers to the ease of entering and exiting a security,
and you shouldn’t overlook it. Liquidity may not seem important when
you’re entering a security because you can be patient and enter over
time, but its importance becomes paramount when you need to exit and
can’t find a buyer (or seller, if you’re short).
(cid:2) The size of the company: Institutional traders care more about size than
individual traders. Over the long term, small company stocks have out-
performed large company stocks. But because small company stocks are
more volatile, traders must take extra precautions when investing in
“tiddlers.” (Seriously, that’s what they’re often called.) For example, you
may have a tighter stop loss on a small cap security than a large cap
security.
(cid:2) The company’s share price: I usually don’t trade stocks below $10 per
share. Many major institutional buyers can’t even trade in stocks in the
single digits. Hence, these stocks are more susceptible to manipulation
(for example, via rumors in trading chat rooms).
Assessing the beta: One security
compared to the market
Beta is one way to measure how risky a position is. In plain English, beta tells
you how volatile a security is relative to the market. Unfortunately, beta isn’t
always right. Its calculation (which is beyond the scope of this book) is based
on historical data. There’s no guarantee that the beta of a stock may not
change — say from 2 today to 1 tomorrow. Therefore, you should know the
beta of a security to get a general idea of how volatile that security is, but
don’t bet your life on it.
Take a gander at some information on the shares of Microsoft Corporation as
an example:
Symbol: MSFT Share Price: $30.26
Beta: 1.16 Volume: 56.29 million
Microsoft Corporation has a beta of 1.16, which means that, on average,
Microsoft shares tend to rise or fall 1.16 times the general market. If the S&P
500 Index rose 1 percent in a day, you may expect to see Microsoft shares
rise 1.16 percent.

Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
There’s no “right” beta for a security. A security that may move up a lot is
desirable, but not if it can also cause you losses significant enough to take you
out of trading. That doesn’t mean you have to pass up a security that has a
very high beta. But it does mean you may have to allocate less to that security
because of its inherent volatility.
Looking at liquidity: Trade frequency
To understand liquidity, it helps to understand how the market works. The
market is composed of millions of buyers and millions of sellers. The big
companies — like Dell Computer or Coca-Cola — almost always have thou-
sands of traders wanting to buy or sell stocks. But what about other compa-
nies? Some securities may not have that many traders interested in buying or
selling stock on a particular day. The problem with that scenario is that the
fewer the shares that trade, the more expensive it is to get into and out of a
position.
In general, you should avoid at all costs companies with low liquidity.
Although there may be some excellent opportunities in stocks that trade 500
shares a day, there are also ample opportunities in stocks that trade 500,000
shares a day. Why expose yourself to the risk of being unable to find a buyer
for your shares if you need to exit in a hurry? You shouldn’t.
So how liquid should shares of a security be before you purchase stock in it?
That depends on your account size. If you’re investing $25,000, you probably
need to stick to stocks that trade at least 100,000 shares per day. If you’re
investing $1,000,000, you may be looking for stocks that trade at least 250,000
shares per day.
As a rule of thumb, your position size shouldn’t represent more than 5 percent
of the average daily volume of the shares.
Suppose you’re interested in buying shares of LowLiquid Corporation, which
trades (in this hypothetical world) on the New York Stock Exchange under
symbol LL. Table 10-1 shows the current orders outstanding for the purchase
and sale of shares in LowLiquid Corporation.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
An order book shows what the market maker sees: the current orders out-
standing for a security. In this example, you see that buyers are interested
in purchasing shares of LowLiquid Corporation for $25, $24, and $23 per
share. However, the only sellers available at this time are selling shares for
$36 and $26.
If you want to buy shares of LowLiquid Corporation, it may be a difficult
proposition. Enter a market order for 200 shares, for example, and you’ll buy
100 shares at $26 and 100 shares at $36 — giving you an average cost basis
of $31. With the current bid at $25, you’re already down almost 20 percent!
The spread, or difference in share prices, may not be always so large, but this
example is intentionally exaggerated to illustrate the high cost that illiquidity
can have on your portfolio.
Sizing up the company:
The smaller, the riskier
Another factor to consider when determining how risky shares of a company
are is the size of that company. Large company stocks (often called large
capitalization stocks or large cap for short) are often less volatile — and
therefore less risky — than small company stocks. But what is “large” and
what is “small?” Ask Mr. Market Cap. Market cap tells you the value of a com-
pany — or more accurately, the value that Wall Street gives it today. The
calculation of market cap is simple, but you’re unlikely to need to calculate
the figure because most Web sites and research services provide it for
free. Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) and Google Finance
(http://finance.google.com/finance) are two popular sources for
this information.
Market cap is defined as
Total shares outstanding × Price per share = Market capitalization
Generally, companies are classified into one of four market cap categories
based on market capitalization:
Market Cap Category Market Capitalization
Large cap $15 billion or higher
Mid cap Between $1 billion and $15 billion
Small cap Between $300 million and $1 billion
Micro cap Below $300 million

Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
Micro cap companies tend to have low liquidity. Moreover, they’re susceptible
to market manipulation. For example, a trader may start a rumor in online
chat rooms or via e-mail that a particular company has a cancer drug break-
through. That kind of unsubstantiated rumor won’t cause a large cap’s shares
to blink, but it may send a micro cap’s stocks through the roof (or the floor, if
the rumor isn’t true or isn’t good!). Although swing traders trade all these
securities, you’re best off avoiding micro cap stocks whenever possible.
Avoiding low-priced shares:
As simple as it sounds
Low-priced shares reflect higher risk than high-priced securities. As a swing
trader, you want to ride quick and strong trends up or down (whether you’re
buying or shorting). Low-price stocks can interfere with that plan because
they introduce new risks.
Cheap stocks are generally defined as those that trade below $5 per share.
Many institutional asset managers can’t even purchase stocks below $5
because they’re widely seen as high-risk gambles. Stocks that trade below $5
often have low liquidity, which means one trade can heavily influence the
price action in one day. So buying the breakout of a stock priced at $3 may
turn out to be nothing more than a flash in the pan.
To stay ahead of the game, avoid stocks below $5 per share that trade
fewer than 250,000 shares per day and have market capitalizations below
$300 million.
Limiting Losses at the Individual
Stock Level
When you know how to determine how risky a stock is, you can use that
information to guide how you manage its risk in the context of your portfolio.
Managing risk at the individual stock level means making sure that no single
position destroys your portfolio. Managing risk at the portfolio level means
preventing several small losses from destroying your portfolio.
The way you manage risk at the individual stock level is through position
sizing. And to set your position size, you have to know how much you’re will-
ing to lose. That loss potential is directly related to the purpose of a stop loss
order, which ensures that should you be wrong — and you will be, many
times — you can exit the position with (ideally) just a small loss.

Figuring out how much
you’re willing to lose
Most professional swing traders limit the amount of loss they’ll tolerate from
a single position to 0.25 percent to 2 percent of total capital. Remember:
Your loss will be affected by commissions, slippage, and market impact (the
possibility of your trade moving the stock price up or down). Therefore, it
may be best to stick to a yardstick of 0.75 percent of your capital, anticipating
that these other costs will likely push your total loss to 1.25 percent or so of
your capital.

==================================================

211
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
Before you even determine how much to invest in a security, you must first
determine how much you’re willing to lose. If you agree with the 0.75 percent
loss threshold that I recommend, simply take out a handy dandy calculator
and compute:
0.75% × Your capital = Tolerable loss
If your portfolio is $50,000, the most you should be willing to lose on a single
position is $375.
The amount you risk on a single position is different than the amount you buy
or sell of that security. You may risk 1 percent or $1,000 (if your account value
is $100,000) on a single position but end up buying $8,000 worth of that secu-
rity. To achieve the risk of 1 percent, you must exit the position if the loss on
the $8,000 reaches $1,000.
Setting your position size
You can position size either by applying a percent of capital approach (a con-
stant rate of capital, say 5 percent) or by allocating new positions by a risk
level you identify. Regardless of which strategy you pursue, make sure you
include some discussion in your trading plan on how you determine the risk
level.
By percent of capital
Setting your position size based on a percent of capital is the simplest way to
allocate capital to new positions. For example, if you have an account worth
$50,000 and select a 3 percent level of capital to invest in each security, you
allocate $1,500 to each trade.
Many position traders (individuals with time horizons measured in months)
invest an equal percentage of capital to each of their investments. As their
capital base grows, they can invest more in each position. Conversely, as
their capital base shrinks, they invest less in each position.
Ultimately, you should invest in ways you feel most comfortable with.
However, I strongly advise against varying the percent of capital invested in
new securities instead of using a constant percent of capital approach,
because setting different percentages can result in random performance.
Having a higher conviction in one trade (and thus allocating a higher percent-
age to it) may interfere with the success of your strategy if you’re a poor pre-
dictor of your own success. Trading doesn’t have to be complicated to be fun
and profitable. Adding complexity where none is needed can lead to sub-par
returns. If you want to vary your position size based on the attractiveness of
the risk/reward present in the trading opportunity, skip to the next section.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
You won’t find a hard and fast rule when it comes to selecting a specific
percentage level to use in setting position size. Choose a percentage level
that’s too small (such as 0.5 percent), and hitting a home run won’t do much
to boost your bottom line. But select a level that’s too large (such as 10
percent), and you could lose your shirt if the stock gaps down hard. Your stop
loss levels can only limit risk so much, and a security that gaps down will
result in a loss larger than the 0.25 percent to 2 percent limit described earlier.
Use the following rules to help you set your percent of capital position sizing
level if you decide to use this method (as opposed to the risk level approach
described in the next section).
(cid:2) Set a small percent of capital level (2 percent to 4 percent) if you trade
securities that exhibit
• Illiquidity (remember, what’s liquid to you may not be liquid to a
$1 billion hedge fund; in other words, size matters)
• Low share prices ($10 or less is low)
• High betas (anything above 2.0)
• Small capitalization size (below $300 million)
(cid:2) Set a large percent of capital level (4 percent to 8 percent) if you trade
securities that exhibit
• Liquidity
• High share prices
• Low betas
• Mid and large capitalization sizes
After setting the percent of capital you want to allocate to your trades, you
have to set your stop loss level. This part is easy given that you’ve already
calculated your threshold of tolerable loss (refer to the earlier section
“Figuring out how much you’re willing to lose”). Set your stop loss level at
the price that would cause the loss on your position to equal 0.75 percent of
your total capital.
Here’s an example of this process at work: Assuming an account value of
$50,000 and a loss threshold level of 0.75 percent, the maximum loss you can
tolerate on any one position is $375. You determine the time is right to buy
shares in Dummies Corporation at $40 per share. You also decide to use a 6
percent of capital allocation approach to your swing trading. Where do you
place your stop loss?
Your stop loss should be set at a price that yields a loss of $375. Investing 6
percent of your assets in Dummies Corporation means you’ll buy 75 shares:
6% × $50,000 = $3,000 ÷ $40 per share = 75 shares

==================================================

213
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
To arrive at your stop loss level, divide your loss threshold by the number
of shares you buy; then subtract the result from your purchase price to get
your stop loss level:
$375 ÷ 75 shares = $5
$40 – $5 = $35 stop loss level
By risk level
Setting your position size using a percent of capital method may seem
arbitrary. After all, isn’t that saying that you have no idea which trade will be
profitable and which one won’t be?
Technically, the answer to your astute question is yes; in effect, you’re
saying that you have no idea which trade will be profitable. But then again,
you wouldn’t be trading in the first place if you knew the trade wouldn’t be
profitable.
A smarter method of setting your position size is varying it according to your
desired exit level. In the example that I set up in the previous section, you
compute an exit level strictly based on the price that would produce a loss of
0.75 percent of your capital. Alternatively, you can determine a key level at
which you want to exit and then determine a position size based on that level.
This is how most professionals swing trade. An arbitrary price may have no
meaning ($35 in the previous example), whereas a specific price level may
signal the end or beginning of a trend. I use a chart to illustrate how a specific
level can help you determine a position size.

Before you calculate how large a position to take, assess the chart. This
daily chart shows Google’s stock price from early April 2007 through mid-
September 2007. Google’s stock rose strongly from mid-May 2007 through
late July 2007 — up 22 percent in two months. However, a poor earnings
report sent Google’s stock sharply down (and serves as a reminder that
trading around earnings reports can be hazardous).
Pretend today is September 18, 2007, and you’ve decided Google is worth
a swing trade. How much of your capital should you invest?
Setting your position size based on a risk level requires you to determine a
price that, if reached, indicates that the trade has gone sour. Obviously, if
shares fall to $460, you have a hint that something isn’t right. But that’s far
too late — you need a more immediate warning sign.
Try using a previous swing low as a line in the sand for your stop loss level.
In this example, assume that the recent swing low highlighted in the chart is
the level that, if reached, indicates that you’re wrong about the trade. That
level is $505.
Google’s stock is trading at $545, and you’re willing to risk 0.75 percent of
your capital on each trade. (Remember: 0.75 percent represents the loss
you’re willing to tolerate from a position, not the maximum amount you’re
willing to allocate to a single position.) To calculate how many shares of
Google to buy, use this formula and plug in your numbers:
Amount of capital at risk ÷ (Entry price – Stop loss level)
$375 (or 0.75% of $50,000) ÷ ($545 – $505) = 9.375 shares, or 9 shares
Thus, setting your position size based on your risk level means purchasing 9
shares of Google. (Round down when you have a fraction. Rounding up may
mean adding more risk, whereas rounding down always keeps you below
your specified loss threshold.)
This example brings to light one weakness of this approach: The closer the
exit price is to your entry price, the larger the implied position. In fact, if
your exit price is $1 or less than your entry price, the preceding formula may
tell you to invest more than your total capital in one stock, which makes
no sense!
The solution to this weakness is to put a ceiling on the amount you invest
in any security. Colin Nicholson, a popular trader from Australia, places
a 6 percent ceiling on his trades. In the example, if you purchase 9 shares
of Google at $545, you’re investing 9.81 percent of your total capital in
one stock.

Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
Although technically only 0.75 percent of your capital is at risk (if you place
your stop loss), there’s always a chance that the stock will gap down or up
and cause your loss to be much greater than your limit. Stop loss orders
don’t guarantee an exit at the price specified because there’s always the
chance a security may gap lower or higher, depending on whether you’re
long or short.
Building a Portfolio with Minimal Risk
When you know the maximum amount of capital you want to allocate to a
single position — based on the percent of capital approach or the risk level
approach, covered in the previous sections — you’re ready to take a step
back and see the forest for the trees.
The risk of focusing on individual securities at the expense of your portfolio
is a simultaneous breakdown of several positions. If you have 25 positions
in your portfolio, for example, and the amount at risk for each position is
1 percent, it’s conceivable (and almost anything can happen in financial mar-
kets) that all 25 positions will go against you at the same time and cause a
major loss of 25 percent of your portfolio.
Don’t believe it can happen? Consider that the markets dropped 22.6 percent
on October 19, 1987. Few believed a move of that magnitude could happen in
a single day. That loss actually exceeded any single-day loss experienced
during the Great Depression.
External factors beyond anyone’s control can impact markets day to day. And
it’s possible for a short position you hold to get bought out (sending its stock
price through the roof) at the same time that the markets tumble, sending
your long positions through the floor. To combat this risk, you should monitor
the risk not only at the individual stock level but also at the total portfolio
level. This idea is no more complicated than others covered in this chapter.
It just requires good record-keeping to execute fully.
Limit all position losses to 7 percent
The prudent approach to limit the losses from all your positions is to place
a ceiling on the amount of capital you risk at any one time. Determine how
much to risk on any single position — I recommend between 0.25 percent
and 2 percent of total capital. The cumulative total of the amount at risk for
each position is considered your total capital at risk.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
I recommend limiting your total capital at risk to 7 percent. Doing so means
that the most you could lose in a single day if everything were to go wrong is
7 percent. Of course, you shouldn’t set stop losses so close to your entry
prices that they’re triggered frequently; that may be a sign you aren’t giving
your stock room to fluctuate. A 7 percent level should rarely (if ever) be trig-
gered because it would require all position stop losses to be executed on the
same day.
The maximum amount you should risk in a single position, in my opinion, is
0.5 percent. This amount allows you to have at least 14 positions (0.5% × 14 =
7%). The larger the amount you risk on a single position, the fewer positions
you can hold. And the fewer positions you hold, the higher the risk of your
portfolio and the greater chance of a major account value swing that may be
difficult to recover from.
To help you understand how this 7 percent rule works, consider an example:
Trader Bob has constructed a portfolio of seven different positions that’s
worth $50,609. Figure 10-2 shows, from left to right, the symbol of each of his
positions, the current stock price for each of his positions, his entry price,
the number of shares he owns, his stop loss level (exit level), and his total
amount at risk based on the specified exit level.

The total amount of capital that Trader Bob has at risk based on this portfo-
lio is 5.25 percent, found by summing up the Amount at Risk column. So
Trader Bob can risk an additional 1.75 percent of his portfolio on new
positions before he hits the 7 percent ceiling that I recommend. That 1.75
percent may be spread across five or more positions.
If you enjoy finding Waldo, you may have noticed that the amount of risk
listed for shares of AAPL, or Apple Inc., is 0.00 percent. What gives? As a
position moves in your favor, you can adjust the stop loss price higher or
lower, depending on the direction you’re trading. In this case, shares of AAPL
were purchased at $140.92 and promptly began rising. After a nice gain,

Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
Trader Bob decided to raise his stop loss level to his entry price level. Doing
so meant he could risk more capital in other positions he owns. The assumed
worse outcome from his position in AAPL is to break even (barring the stock
price gapping down).
The amount at risk can never be a negative value, so don’t use negative risk
amounts when you can raise your stop loss order to a price that locks in a
profit. If Trader Bob raises his stop loss to $150 in the future, his amount at
risk isn’t –0.5 percent. Raising your stop loss order ensures your portfolio
doesn’t swing trade too aggressively and compensates for the inherent limits
of stop loss orders. After all, you may or may not get executed at your stop
loss price. So if a security gaps down below your stop loss price (assuming
you’re trading on the long side), your stop loss order will be executed at a
much lower price than you anticipated.
Diversify your allocations
Another method of limiting losses on a portfolio level is diversification. No
doubt you’ve heard the term thrown around on financial news networks. It
seems every expert often recommends avoiding “putting your eggs in one
basket.” Fortunately for you, this section gives you a bit more to go on than
a farm analogy.
Diversification is one of the shining gems mined from academia. In a nutshell,
investing in more than one security, sector, or trading vehicle helps protect
you in the event that a problem befalls one or more of those securities.
The aim is to have a portfolio in which some securities’ gains offset other
securities’ losses. The best scenario is simply a portfolio with all gainers,
but in reality, some positions make money while others lose money.
At its simplest level, diversification can be seen as a tool of avoiding the
problems of a single company. For example, you may buy shares in General
Motors and Ford so that, if Ford takes a tumble, your shares in General Motors
can offset your losses.
But what happens if an autoworkers strike brings down both General Motors
and Ford? In that scenario, owning securities not in the auto business may be
prudent. So you pick up shares of Nike and Dell Computer. But when the
United States goes into recessions, shares of all your U.S.-based companies
are likely to fall. That means you may want to be investing in Asia or Europe
as well.
These examples give you an idea of the benefits of diversification. The sim-
plest form of diversification is investing in several securities, but you also
can diversify according to industry exposure and asset class. I cover all three
of these options in the following sections.
1177__229933668833--cchh1100..iinndddd 221177 77//2288//0088 66::5588::0077 PPMM

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
By number of securities
The most elementary way of diversifying your portfolio is simply to spread
your assets across several securities. The more, the better — the thinking
goes. But how many securities constitute a diversified portfolio?
The benefits of diversification can be realized with 10 to 20 securities, but I
should warn you: This number assumes the companies are in different indus-
tries and countries. Investing in 10 semiconductor manufacturers doesn’t
expose a portfolio to businesses outside of a small niche of the market.
Your trading plan should indicate a target number of positions you trade. The
more positions you have, the less time you’ll have to devote to each single one
and the more likely your returns will mirror the market. So keep your number
below 20 or 25.
Following the position sizing guidelines outlined earlier in this chapter (see
“Setting your position size”) largely takes care of this first point of diversifica-
tion by number because the risk guidelines ensure that you have several
positions. But if you’re going to brave the market without these guidelines,
try to construct a portfolio of at least ten different positions and securities in
different industries (see the following section for tips).
By industry exposure
According to William J. O’Neil, founder of Investor’s Business Daily, an indus-
try group roughly determines 30 to 40 percent of a security’s return. So being
exposed to only one or two industry groups is extremely risky because the
returns of your securities will be very similar. Think about it in terms of the
auto example from earlier in this chapter: Are the factors affecting General
Motors and Ford all that different? Or Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard?
Exxon Mobil and Chevron?
Following is an outline of the major industry sectors (as defined by the
Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS). Fortunately, the software
services you use should break down the industry or economic sector that
your securities belong to.

(cid:2) Financials
(cid:2) Information technology
(cid:2) Telecommunications services
(cid:2) Utilities
There’s nothing wrong with concentrating in a few sectors — say four or five.
But beware of investing in only one or two sectors because you won’t benefit
from the diversification benefits inherent in investing in different parts of the
economy.
Be sure to set a minimum number of industry groups that you trade in. I
recommend identifying at least three different sectors and trading a minimum
of six different industry groups, smaller classification groupings than sectors.
For example, energy drilling, energy services, and energy integrated are all
industry groups in the energy sector.
By asset class
Another way to diversify your portfolio is to invest in different investment
vehicles. The asset classes you trade decrease your overall portfolio risk, so
if you’re using this approach, you should shoot to trade two to three different
asset classes. Two primary vehicles for achieving diversification by asset
class are exchange traded funds (ETFs) and American Depository Receipts
(ADRs):
(cid:2) Exchange traded funds (ETFs): These funds are a growing segment of
the market. They represent baskets of stocks in a sector, style (such as
growth or value), country, and even short positions of major indexes.
ETFs now also provide exposure to commodities and currencies.
Trading ETFs helps diversify your portfolio across several stocks in one
sector or country. For example, you may be right on a substantial move
in oil stocks, but you may select the one oil company that’s having prob-
lems. Buying an energy ETF (such as the iShares Dow Jones US Energy
ETF) allows you to profit from the movement of several energy stocks.
Purchasing one ETF is like instant diversification across a style or sector
of the market.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
Sometimes there’s a bull market in commodities or currencies while
stock markets are lagging. So various asset classes can provide a boost
of returns in addition to lower risk. Here are some of the main ETFs that
offer you exposure to commodities:
• Precious metals: Gold can be traded via streetTRACKS Gold
(symbol: GLD); silver can be traded via iShares Silver Trust
(symbol: SLV). If you’re interested in metals and mining, you can
swing trade the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (symbol: XME).
• Energy: Your options for trading energy ETFs include Energy
Select Sector SPDR (symbol: XLE). Or you can trade energy stocks
that rise and fall with the price of oil. Energy exploration and
production companies especially track changes in crude oil and
natural gas prices.
• Agricultural commodities: The Dow Jones-AIG Agriculture Total
Return ETF (symbol: JJA) provides exposure to agricultural
commodities.
You can obtain exposure to currencies (such as the Euro or Canadian
Dollar) through the various Currency Shares ETFs found at www.
currencyshares.com.
(cid:2) American Depository Receipts (ADRs): ADRs allow you to take advan-
tage of strength (or weakness) in a company based outside the U.S
without ever leaving home. Currently, the fastest growing markets are
in China, India, and Latin America.
Mixing international securities into your portfolio offers greater diversifi-
cation benefits than having strictly U.S. stocks because international
markets may zig when the U.S. market zags. The more technical explana-
tion of the benefit of ADRs is that foreign securities have lower correla-
tion ratios to the U.S. market than domestic securities. Of course, the
currency of those foreign markets may also improve (or hurt) your
returns. To find a list of international equities, check out www.adr.com.
Combine long and short positions
You can reduce the risk for your total portfolio by combining long and
short positions. Having long and short positions gives you a lower standard
deviation of returns than if you have a portfolio that’s 100 percent long or 100
percent short (which means its returns vary less than the overall market).
Translating that into English: A swing trader who combines long and short
positions is protected in the event of a major rally or decline in the market.
Gains off of shorts/longs can offset losses from longs/shorts.
When the overall market is in a heavy bull advance, a portfolio with short
positions is likely to be stopped out of those positions often (meaning your
stop loss orders will be executed). Alternatively, when the overall market is
1177__229933668833--cchh1100..iinndddd 222200 77//2288//0088 66::5588::0088 PPMM

==================================================

221
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
in a heavy bear decline, a portfolio with long positions is likely to be stopped
out of those positions frequently. In other words, profitably shorting in a
strong bull market or profitably going long in a strong bear market is difficult.
The conundrum of having too many long or short positions has two possible
solutions:
(cid:2) Limit the amount of your portfolio that’s short or long, depending on
the strength or weakness of the market. For example, in a strong bull
market, you may hold short positions not exceeding 20 percent of your
entire portfolio. Alternatively in a strong bear market, you may hold long
positions not exceeding 20 percent of your entire portfolio.
(cid:2) Trade different asset classes that may be trending in a different
direction than the stock market. If stocks are in a raging bull market,
perhaps your short positions can come from the commodities or
currency markets (see the preceding section for ideas of how to gain
exposure to these markets).
Whichever method you choose, make sure your trading plan outlines how
you determine when you’re net long (that is, when you hold more long
positions than short) or net short (when you hold more short positions
than long).
Planning Your Exit Strategies
Your exit strategy dictates when you’ll exit a security. Some swing traders
believe that an exit strategy is more important than an entry strategy, and I
agree wholeheartedly.
Believe it or not, a trader can generate healthy profits by randomly entering
securities if he or she has an exit strategy that lets winners run and cuts
losers fast.
Sometimes you’ll exit for profits, and other times you’ll exit for losses. Of
course, the most desirable exit strategy is exiting for profits. The next desir-
able option is exiting because of the passage of time. The least desirable exit
strategy is exiting for losses. Most trades, however, fall into the profit or loss
category. Rarely will you exit because of time.
Exiting for profitable trades
Stop loss rules are your way out when a trade goes bad (more on that topic
later in this chapter). But what should you do when a trade turns out right?

==================================================

222
Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
There are three major ways to exit profitable trades: by a predetermined
profit target, by a predetermined price target, or by swing lows/highs.
Predetermined profit target
A predetermined profit target is the easiest method of taking profits off the
table. When you enter your trade, you set a specific gain (usually expressed
in percentage terms) that you seek and then take your money off the table
after that gain has been achieved.
Swing traders shouldn’t set unreasonable profit targets; your profit target is a
function of your time horizon. Because swing traders’ horizons can vary from
a few days to a few weeks, your profit target may range from the low single
digits to the low double digits. If you’re active in the markets and trade often,
then your profit target should be modest — closer to 5 percent. However, if
you prefer to hold your swing trades for a few weeks, then a 10 percent or 15
percent profit target is attainable.
Some professional swing traders exit in stages. For example, they may sell 50
percent of their position after a security has risen 10 percent in price. Then
they may ride the rest of the position until there’s a technical breakdown or
change in fundamentals. The advantage of exiting in stages is that you lock in
profits early. A security that rises 10 percent and then falls back to your entry
price results in a 0 percent return if you failed to take profits on its way up.
Exiting in stages may improve your returns, but it also requires more work.
There’s more record-keeping, for example, if you exit in stages versus exiting
in one go. You also generate more commissions, more taxes, and so on. Make
sure that your strategy fits your work ethic and time commitment to the
market.
Predetermined price target
A predetermined price target is an alternative way to take money off the
table. In this case, you set a specific target based on the chart or the funda-
mentals of the company.
In the case of technical alert criteria, you may set your profit target equal to a
prior swing high or swing low. Securities tend to find resistance and support
at price levels achieved in the past, so you may set your target on the basis
that the security will reach that prior peak. (I cover how to determine techni-
cal alert criteria in Chapters 4 and 5.)
In the case of fundamental criteria, you may set your profit target equal to
a price multiple of the security — a price multiple based on earnings, sales,
and so on (see Chapter 9 for more on the different price multiples). For exam-
ple, if you suspect that Dell’s shares should be trading for a price to earnings
1177__229933668833--cchh1100..iinndddd 222222 77//2288//0088 66::5588::0088 PPMM

223
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
(P/E) ratio equal to Hewlett-Packard’s shares, then your price target would
be equal to Hewlett-Packard’s P/E ratio multiplied by Dell’s trailing earnings.
(I cover fundamental analysis in detail in Part III.)
One word of caution: Don’t set price targets equal to round numbers or whole
dollar amounts (like $35, $80, or $120). Many novice traders set their price
levels in the same area, which may prevent the security from reaching that
price. For example, if you buy a security and expect the stock to face some
headwind when it reaches $50, place your limit order to sell shares at $49.83
or a level nearby. Traders who place their limit orders right at the level of
resistance and at a round number often are left with unfilled orders.
Swing lows/highs
Swing traders often use prior swing lows and highs as reference points on
when to jump ship from a profitable investment. A breakdown below a low
or above a high may signal the beginning of a new downtrend or uptrend,
respectively.
This strategy differs somewhat from the predetermined price target I explain
in the preceding section. In that strategy, you set a price target of when to
take profits off the table. In this case, however, you use prior swing lows and
highs as reference points for when to exit. If you’re long shares of a security,
this strategy calls for putting a stop loss order below a recent swing low. In
contrast, a predetermined price target calls for placing a limit sell order when
the security reaches the area you expected.
Figure 10-3 shows Exxon Mobil (symbol: XOM) from July 2007 through
October 2007. It illustrates how a predetermined price target differs from
exiting on a swing low or high.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
In the case of buying shares of Exxon Mobil, you may have set a sell limit
order near the prior high of $94 (but not at $94 — use a price below that and
not a round number).
Contrast the Exxon Mobil exit to the strategy of placing a stop sell order
below prior swing lows in the chart of Sigma Designs, Inc. (symbol: SIGM),
shown in Figure 10-4. It shows that by placing a sell stop order below
prior swing lows, you can stay in a strong trend longer and reap a larger
percentage of the move.

Taking cues from technical signals
In addition to taking profits based off of swing lows and swing highs, you
can take profits based off of technical signals. When using technical signals
(flip back to Chapter 5 for a refresher on the various technical indicators),
ensure that some crystal clear trigger or catalyst is present that leads you to
take profits.
Some examples of selling strategies for profits include:
(cid:2) Exiting when shares close below a moving average (for example, a
nine-day moving average)
(cid:2) Exiting when the MACD line crosses below (or above, if you’re short)
the signal line
(cid:2) Exiting when –DMI crosses above +DMI (if you’re long)
(cid:2) Exiting when prices break an uptrend line (or downtrend line)
Consider Figure 10-5, which highlights how a swing trader may have taken
profits in a trade of shares of W&T Offshore (symbol: WTI) on the turn-up of
the nine-day moving average. The profit-taking exit in this example is based
on the share price closing below the nine-day moving average. The potential

225
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
profit — assuming entry and exits near the closing prices on the days high-
lighted, and exclusive of commissions, taxes, and slippage — is 19.18 percent
over 18 days. The stop loss level (which I delve into in the later section,
“Exiting based on a stop loss level”) should be placed below a recent swing
low but not exactly at the low or exactly at a round number.
Figure 10-5:
Taking
profits

Exiting based on the passage of time
A time trigger exit is sometimes necessary when a position you trade meets
neither its profit target nor its stop loss exit. But because your capital
shouldn’t be tied up in a position that isn’t generating profits, I must cover
the rare but possible exit based on the passage of time.
Perhaps you bought or shorted at the wrong time, or an event you expected
to occur didn’t materialize. In any case, a security that meanders sideways is
tying up your capital. You’re better off exiting the security and having cash at
your disposal should an opportunity present itself.
As with other aspects of swing trading, there’s no hard and fast rule on what
constitutes sufficient time for a position to make a move. If you trade often
with a time horizon measured in days, you should give a position up to a week
to make a move. However, if you’re a swing trader who goes for larger moves
that unfold over a few weeks, you may give a position more time.
Exiting based on a stop loss level
Wouldn’t it be nice if your only decision was when to take a profit off the
table? “Hmm . . . should I leave with a 10 percent gain or wait for a 15 percent
gain?” Alas, you don’t always have this luxury.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
Many times you’ll be faced with the prospect of exiting a position at a loss.
Although it may be difficult to admit you were wrong, you have to get used to
it if you’re going to be a swing trader. The most common way you’ll exit
losing positions is through a stop loss level.
Technically, a stop loss can be mental or physical:
(cid:2) A mental stop loss level is a price level you keep in your own records but
only submit to your broker when the security has reached that price
level. The advantage of using a mental stop loss level is that you may
avoid a whipsaw — being forced out of a position due to a short but
violent move up or down.
(cid:2) A physical stop loss order is an order you submit to your broker the
second your entry is executed. When you enter a stop loss order (which
should be submitted “Good till cancelled” so that it doesn’t expire after
one day), your order is visible to other traders, so it’s possible for them
to move prices to take out your order.
Although this risk exists, I can’t stress enough the importance of using
physical stop loss orders entered with your broker for the first few years
you swing trade. You expose yourself to the risk of a whipsaw, but you
also avoid the risk of failing to exit when a security’s price moves fast
and furious (furiously, for all you English majors).
Stop loss orders should be entered around some major support/resistance
level or technical level. If you’re long shares of a position, your stop loss order
should be below the entry price and entered as a sell order. If you’re short
shares of a position, your stop loss order should be above the entry price and
be entered as a buy to cover order.
The following techniques for setting stop losses only apply to swing traders
who set their positions based on a risk level. Swing traders who set their
position sizes based on a percent of capital approach automatically deter-
mine a stop loss level based on their loss threshold level. Swing traders who
set their position sizes based on a risk level, however, should understand the
different methods of selecting a risk level.
Stop loss based on a support/resistance level
This first approach to setting your stop loss level is straightforward. By
examining a chart, you should be able to determine levels of support and
resistance that, if broken, would signal the end or beginning of a trend.
Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to identify a level that’s most
applicable to you.
To simplify matters, suppose you’re interested in buying a security. In that
case, your stop loss level should be based around a major support level
(preferably, right below that support level). A three-year-old support level
isn’t going to have significant relevance most of the time (an exception being
if the support level was tested several times during those three years).
1177__229933668833--cchh1100..iinndddd 222266 77//2288//0088 66::5588::1100 PPMM

Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Defense: Managing Risk
In general, a support level is significant the
(cid:2) More recent it is
(cid:2) More often it has been tested
(cid:2) Closer it is to a significant price level ($100, $10, $50, and so on)
(cid:2) Heavier the volume is on the formation of the support level
Choose important support levels so that you only exit a position when a
trend change is most likely. Choosing a weak support level may cause you to
exit a position prematurely.
Stop loss based on a technical level
You may exit a position based on the breaking of a significant technical level.
Dozens of technical indicators can be plotted on a chart, and when one of
those indicators gives a signal, an informed swing trader exits.
Technical indicators can be tricky. Just because your technical charting pro-
gram may have 101 different technical indicators developed by individuals I
won’t name here (because I don’t know their names) doesn’t mean you need
to use all 101 indicators in your strategy. In fact, professionals often use only
two or three to make their decisions. Why not use all the bounty with which
you’ve been bestowed?
As it turns out, all technical indicators are based on one or two inputs: price
and volume. Consequently, there are only so many ways you can peel an
onion before you realize those tears are coming out no matter what you do.
You don’t get a performance boost from using ten indicators; instead, you get
ten people telling you largely the same thing.
Stop loss orders are sometimes used in conjunction with moving averages.
Some swing traders place stop loss orders right below a major moving
average and adjust the order every day or two. Others who use mental stop
loss orders may wait for a security to close below a moving average before
taking action to enter an order with their broker.
Figure 10-6 shows a stop loss order executed based on the nine-day moving
average (DMA). A gap up in shares of Yahoo! (symbol: YHOO) in early 2006
seemed to be a prelude to a strong uptrend. However, shares of Yahoo!
quickly reversed. Setting a stop loss based on a support level may have
exposed you to the violent fall, whereas a stop loss based on the moving
average would’ve given you an earlier exit.
A stop loss order can be based on actual signals from a technical indicator
(such as MACD). The downside to using such orders is that delays can result.
You don’t know for sure what price a security must reach before an indicator
will signal its flashing red lights. Using an indicator like a moving average,
which is actually plotted on the chart, is helpful because you can identify a
specific price before the signal is given.

rade execution is the home stretch of swing trading. If you’ve dotted
your i’s and crossed your t’s, then how you execute your swing trade is
unlikely to spell the difference between success and failure. Still, you should
perfect entering your orders as much as possible so that you aren’t burned
by a security that’s in the process of reversing direction. Perfecting your
order entry largely means knowing what type of order to enter, a factor that’s
mainly dependent on whether you’re a full- or part-time swing trader. If
you’ve done your homework, though, your execution strategy should empha-
size entry with the flow of the market.
If you’re a full-time swing trader or you execute trades during market hours,
you have more order types at your disposal than if you’re trading part-time.
You also have the opportunity to use a couple of helpful tools to refine your
trades: intraday charting and Nasdaq Level II quotes. In this chapter, I outline
the major order types and tell you which ones you should use most, depend-
ing on your situation. I also explain how to make the most of intraday tools to
refine your swing trading.
If you’re a part-time swing trader, you should follow a different entry strategy
than your full-time counterparts. But never fear! This chapter outlines the
unique considerations you face when entering and exiting positions.
Understanding Market Mechanics
Understanding the mechanics of the underlying markets is essential to
knowing when to enter or exit an order. On a basic level, I’m guessing you
understand that securities have bid prices (where you can sell) and ask
prices (where you can buy). Both the bid and ask have a number of shares
1188__229933668833--cchh1111..iinndddd 223311 77//2288//0088 66::5588::4477 PPMM

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
associated with them. For example, the bid may have 100 shares associated
with it, indicating you can sell 100 shares at that price. But who’s buying and
selling these securities to you?
Dealers who make markets in certain securities are called market makers.
Market makers are often decried as evil geniuses who control security prices.
In all honesty, they aren’t geniuses . . . or evil creatures. They’re just ordinary
folks who can push prices to clear your limit orders or stop orders aggre-
gated around a certain price.
From the market maker’s perspective, a bid is where he or she is willing to
buy the security, and an ask is his or her offer to sell the security at that
price. Market makers offer a certain amount of stock on the buy and sell
sides. So if a market maker is offering 2,000 shares of Danaher at $75.23 and
you enter a market order for 2,500 shares, your first 2,000 will be executed at
$75.23. However, the remaining 500 shares may be executed at a higher price.
A thinly traded stock may have 2,000 shares available at $75 per share and
500 shares available at $76. A 2,500 share market order in such a stock would
fill at $75 and $76.
When a security has great market depth (many orders on the buy and sell
side), plenty of shares are available for buying or selling. When a security has
little depth, few shares are available. Certain order types (such as a market
order; see “Living life in the fast lane: Market orders,” later in this chapter for
more on this type) in a security with little depth may move it significantly —
at least for a little while.
Because certain order types can move prices significantly in thinly traded
securities, you want to stick to actively traded securities. You don’t want to
expose yourself to significant liquidity risk. Swing traders normally generate
alpha, or outperformance, in the quality of their buys and sells, not in their
ability to correctly estimate the mispricing of liquidity risk.
If a security has a wide spread, you can enter a certain order type (specifi-
cally a limit order, explained later in this chapter) to buy or sell at a price
between the bid and the ask. When market makers receive your order, they
have two options: They can execute the trade at the specified price (or a
better one), or they can place your order as the best bid or offer.
Suppose you want to buy shares of fictitious company Wide Spreads Inc., and
the bid/ask spread is $17.50/$19.25. (For now, ignore the fact that as a shrewd
swing trader, you’d never transact in a security with such a wide spread.) If
you enter a buy limit order for $18.25 ($1 less than the current asking price),
the company’s market maker must either execute your order or make your
1188__229933668833--cchh1111..iinndddd 223322 77//2288//0088 66::5588::4477 PPMM

Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Entries and Exits
order the new bid. So either you’ll receive an execution or the new bid/ask
spread will be $18.25 to $19.25. Someone entering a market sell order will be
executed at your bid, and your buy order will be filled.
When I first learned that I could affect bid/ask spreads, I entered orders left
and right just to see my order come up on top. I don’t recommend this tactic,
because your orders may actually be executed.
Surveying the Major Order Types
In order to efficiently enter or exit a long or short position on a security you
want to swing trade, you need to get acquainted with the major types of
orders. These order types are available to anyone buying securities —
whether you’re a long-term investor, day trader, or swing trader. But swing
traders may use certain order types more than other kinds of traders or
investors do.
Orders can be good until cancelled (GTC), which means the orders stay open
until you execute or cancel them, or good until the day (GTD), which means
the orders remain open until the market closes.
The following sections describe the four major types of orders and when you
want to use them.
Living life in the fast lane: Market orders
Get me in and get me in now. That’s the mantra of the market order, an order
that instructs your broker to buy or sell a security immediately, regardless of
price. Market orders are useful when urgency to enter a security based on a
particular chart pattern or technical indicator abounds (turn to Chapters 4
and 5 for a refresher on how to read charts and indicator signals). You may
also want to use them when a security is very liquid, and there are so many
shares on the bid and ask sides that you’re unlikely to receive an execution
price starkly different than where the security’s currently trading.
I caution you against using market orders when entering a position. I’m more
likely to use one to exit a position instead. Never, ever enter a market order
when the markets are closed, because a security may gap higher or lower at
the next day’s open and result in an execution you don’t want.
Market orders should only be used by full-time swing traders.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
Knowing your boundaries: Limit orders
Limit orders instruct your broker to buy, sell, or short a security at a specific
price or a better one. Better, of course, depends on the direction of the trade.
The better price is lower when you’re buying and higher when you’re selling.
I’m a big proponent of limit orders. Even when the current price of a
security is agreeable to you, and a market order may make sense, a limit
order protects you from being on the receiving end of a price execution
that’s significantly above or below the current market price.
Part-time traders can analyze markets after the close and enter limit orders
for the following day. After you receive confirmation that the limit order has
been executed, you should enter a stop loss order.
Calling a halt: Stop orders
A stop order specifies that you enter or exit a position after the security’s
price reaches a predefined level. Two types of stop orders exist:
(cid:2) Sell stop orders: This type of order instructs your broker to sell shares
of a security at a preset price if the security reaches that price or a
lower one. Sell stop orders are useful to protect your capital or enter a
short position.
(cid:2) Buy stop orders: A buy stop order instructs the broker to buy a security
if its shares trade at or above a predefined price level. Consider employ-
ing buy stop orders when entering a position on the long side or
attempting to protect your capital on a short position.
Both types of stop orders become market orders when the price in question
is reached. Note, however, that because they become market orders (which
instruct a broker to execute a trade immediately), you may receive a price
that’s worse or better than the price you specify.
Mixing the best of both worlds:
Stop limit orders
Think of a stop limit order as a combination of a stop order and a limit order.
When your predefined price is reached, the stop limit order becomes a limit
order to ensure you don’t execute at a price that’s significantly different
than what you expected. You shouldn’t mind not getting filled if you haven’t
entered the security yet or if you’re simply trying to maximize profit. But when
matters are growing ugly, you can’t afford for an order not to execute because
it became a limit order.

Just for kicks, say you decide to buy shares of THQ Inc. that have been in a
range between $15 and $20. Suppose you enter a buy stop order of 1,000
shares at $20.29 — so you can enter a position after shares break above their
trading range. If THQ reports blockbuster earnings one day and shares open
at $30 per share, you’ll own 1,000 shares at $30 or so. However, you’ll have
increased your position size by 50 percent because of the gap. The original
order would’ve bought $20,290 worth of stock. The actual order buys $30,000
worth of stock.
The solution to this conundrum is a stop limit order. Had you entered a stop
limit order of $20.29, the stop order would’ve become a limit order after
shares traded at or above $20.29. A buy limit order at $20.29 wouldn’t have
been executed if shares were trading at $30.
Placing Orders as a Part-Time
Swing Trader
Having a full-time job doesn’t preclude you from swing trading. You just need
to carefully craft your order-entry system to account for the uncertainty of
how security prices will perform when the market opens the following day.
One of the keys to mastering order entries and exits is to execute only on the
day after a trading signal — likely a chart pattern of some kind or a technical
indicator. Never initiate just because an entry signal exists today but was gen-
erated a few days or weeks back. If your entry method calls for buying stocks
when the nine-day moving average turns up, don’t buy a security with a nine-
day moving average that turned up last week.
The next two sections break down how you can enter and exit a security as a
part-time swing trader.
Entering the fray
A limit order is your primary entry weapon as a part-time swing trader. If a
buy signal appears on a particular day, you can review the day’s price behav-
ior and determine where to place a reasonable limit buy order. Be choosy. If
your limit order isn’t filled, no big deal. There are plenty of fish in the sea —
just wait for the next one. By not desperately chasing after the security, you
can enter trades on your terms when prices come to you.
You don’t want to trade the opening of a market. This is a chaotic time when
news that emerged after the market closed the previous day is reflected in
opening share prices. There can be major swings, both positive and negative.

==================================================

237
Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Entries and Exits
Never, never, never — did I say never? — enter a market order when the
market is closed. Doing so can only cause grief and heartache. A market order
entered after the market closes is executed at the following day’s opening
price — regardless of what that price is. Because movements can be fierce
at the opening, you can’t enter market orders the previous day due to the
uncertainty of where the price executions will occur. Even if you want to buy
shares at the price they closed at the prior day, a market order may be ex-
ecuted significantly above or below that price, depending on prevailing mar-
ket conditions (that is, how many market orders exist, the distribution of buys
and sells, and the market maker’s own share inventory). Always keep in mind
the ol’ Wall Street saying concerning order entry when the market opens
versus when the market closes: “Amateurs trade the open. Professionals
trade the close.”
Exiting to cut your losses
(or make a profit)
Exiting a swing trade is another matter. Unlike entering, where patience can
pay dividends, exiting should be done quickly and judiciously. Why? Because
you usually exit a position for one of two reasons — either your profit target
was hit or an indicator flashed an exit signal. When either of these scenarios
occurs, don’t sit around to see what other traders will do.
When you exit for a loss, you want out at the available price. That’s why I rec-
ommend that part-time swing traders use stop loss orders, which automati-
cally convert into a market order when the specified price level is reached.
As a part-time swing trader, you should also use trailing stop loss orders.
These are stop loss orders that are raised or lowered (depending on whether
you’re long or short the security) over time as the trade goes in your favor.
Raising these orders protects your profits (unless the security gaps through
the stop loss area).
Placing Orders if Swing Trading’s
Your Full-Time Gig
If you’re a full-time swing trader, you have more tools at your disposal.
Because you can watch the market during the day, you can enter market
orders when appropriate and monitor short-term buying and selling activity.
The following sections lay out how to set up your trading system as a
full-time swing trader and how to put various tools to use to make your
job easier.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
Considering the best order types for you
Like your part-time counterparts, you can plan to rely on limit orders for
entries and stop loss orders for exits if you’re a full-time swing trader.
However, because you spend more time swing trading, you have the luxury of
choosing how you enter trades depending on the overall market environ-
ment. Rarely is a security so hot that you absolutely need to execute a
market order. More often than not, you can size up the market and enter a
limit order near a recent intraday support or resistance level.
You want to execute an order entry or exit only on the day of a trading signal,
which pops out at you with the help of chart patterns or technical indicators.
Always react to current trading signals, not signals that first appeared on your
radar a while back.
Taking advantage of intraday charting
to time your entries and exits
As a full-time swing trader, you can improve your trading results by applying
an intraday trading overlay, which is a system of entry based on intraday
charting, to your existing entry plan. After a trading signal is generated on a
daily chart, you can zoom in on a 30-minute or 1-hour chart and time your
entry based on some technical indicator (see more on that later in this chap-
ter). Sometimes, this trading overlay can help you avoid buying or shorting
securities that are about to reverse course. Other times, the intraday trading
overlay helps you receive better prices on your trades. Of course, it’s also
possible that the trading overlay could result in paying worse prices if a
security is in a strong trend. There are no free lunches in trading.
For example, you may enter securities on the day (or the day after) their
nine-day moving average turns higher, provided that certain intraday
charting signals are also met. This second step filters out securities that
may be showing strength on a daily chart but weakness on an hourly or
30-minute chart.
I don’t think an intraday trading overlay is absolutely essential to swing
trade successfully, but it can improve your returns if used intelligently. The
system’s intention is to improve your entry or exit price by analyzing the prior
days’ support and resistance levels and reading the signals generated by the
technical indicators. If a buy signal is generated on a daily chart but you see
weakness in the intraday chart, then the prudent course of action is to wait for
the intraday chart to stabilize and rebound before entering. Occasionally, the
intraday trading overlay keeps you out of a security that’s in the process of
tanking or rising, depending on whether you’re buying or shorting.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
Selecting the appropriate time frame
Most real-time charting programs allow you to analyze 1-minute, 5-minute,
10-minute, 30-minute, and 1-hour charts. That’s an awful lot of time frames.
If a technical indicator looks negative on one intraday time frame, a naïve
swing trader may turn to a different intraday time frame to see whether that
indicator gives the signal he or she wants. After all, charts, like statistics, can
be tortured into telling you what you want to hear.
Always be consistent in the time frames you use (such as daily and hourly,
or daily and 30 minutes). I recommend sticking to one intraday time frame
because doing so simplifies matters and avoids the temptation of flipping
through time frames to see which one is giving you the signals you want
to see.
Personally, I prefer a 30-minute or hourly chart. I feel that charts covering
shorter periods of time belong in the day trader’s arena, because the shorter
the time period, the noisier the market. You want to trade short but powerful
trends that are driven by some fundamental reason — not by the fact that
some pension fund’s liquidating shares to deliver a retiree a lump-sum
payment.
Choosing your entry criteria
Intraday charting systems can be as varied as systems based on daily price
data. An hourly or 30-minute chart may call for entry based on one of the
following criteria:
(cid:2) A moving average crossover
(cid:2) An MACD buy signal
(cid:2) A breakout out of a consolidation phase
(cid:2) A new hourly bar high
You may base your entry signals on a technical criterion identified above or
on some different technical criteria of your choosing. Just don’t base your
entry criteria on chart patterns. I’ve found that chart patterns formed over a
few hours aren’t as reliable as those formed over several weeks or months.
Balancing the advantages and disadvantages
of intraday trading signals
Your biggest advantage as a full-time swing trader over a trader who can’t
watch the markets throughout the day is the ability to enter an order as soon
as a trading signal appears. This advantage is even greater in securities that
tend to be volatile. By paying attention to the signals generated through your
intraday charting system, you can enter earlier than traders who rely on
end-of-day data.

Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Your Entries and Exits
Yet this blessing can easily become a curse, because trading signals gener-
ated intraday can be reversed intraday. In such cases, you may need to exit
your position because the original reason for entering was reversed.
One way to mitigate the risk of an intraday trading signal reversal is to execute
orders in the last hour of the trading day.
Investigating who’s behind the bidding:
Nasdaq Level II quotes
Nasdaq Level II quotes, posted prices that show you who’s bidding for and
offering shares of the security you’re about to enter, are more of a staple for
day traders, but they may be helpful in your full-time swing trading arsenal.
They allow you to quickly see the relative positioning of orders by market
makers. Generally, Nasdaq Level II quotes are only available for securities
trading on Nasdaq and can be obtained from most brokers and real-time
charting programs.
The following sections help you dive into the nitty-gritty of Nasdaq Level II
quotes.
Contrasting Level I and Level II quotes
Level I quotes (think of them as the standard quotes you receive from Yahoo!
Finance or Google) report what the current bid and ask prices are. They
also include how many shares are being bid and how many shares are being
offered. But don’t expect any bells or whistles. A Level I quote, like that
shown in Figure 11-1 of shares of Warnaco Group (symbol: WRNC), shows
top-level data that can be helpful as a snapshot.
Figure 11-1:

Nasdaq Level II quotes give traders a wealth of information on order and
trading activity in Nasdaq-listed securities. Whereas a Level I quote tells you
what the best bids and offers are, Level II quotes tell you who else is bidding

or offering shares away from the market (that is, at prices above the best
offer and below the best bid). This information can be valuable in discerning
short-term price movements.
Figure 11-2 shows a typical Level II quote. You can see that different market
makers are offering to buy (left side) and sell (right side) shares of Microsoft
(symbol: MSFT). Notice that at each price, a market maker offers a certain
amount of shares (shown here as size). The number of market makers
offering shares on both the buy and sell sides at very close prices indicates
that this security has significant market depth.
Avoid thinking that Level II quotes confer some type of trading advantage.
Other swing traders, day traders, and the like have Level II quotes. The key is
how you use the quotes. As a swing trader, you must recognize that you won’t
derive a significant source of alpha, or outperformance, from your near-term
trading by using Level II quotes. You can, however, improve your entry and
exit prices and add a small amount of return during the course of a year.
Your intraday trading overlay may rely on Level II quotes as opposed to
technical signals generated on an hourly or 30-minute chart. In that case, you
may enter on pullbacks in price action. Alternatively, you may wait to see
strong buying or selling activity, depending on whether you’re looking to open
a long or short position.

I used to think that having Level II quotes somehow gave me an advantage
over the common man — like I was going to improve my trading game with a
tool akin to X-ray vision. Don’t buy into that idea like I did. Level II quotes are
a short-term guide — and I mean short. Day traders derive more value from
Level II quotes than swing traders because their time horizons are measured
in minutes. Of course, I don’t mean you should ignore the Level II quote
screen. Just consider placing more emphasis on intraday charting (covered
earlier in this chapter).
Evaluating the quotes
Level II quotes have a couple of salient features. First, bids and offers for
securities are separated into two panes. The left pane displays various
market makers’ bids to buy at various prices, and the right pane displays the
offers to sell by various market markers at various prices. Confused? Take a
look back at Figure 11-2.
The left side of the pane shows that LEHM is offering to buy 2,000 shares of
security MSFT at $25.63. LEHM is the market maker and is the four-letter
abbreviation of Lehman Brothers. (All market makers are identified by four-
letter symbols.) Directly below LEHM is BRUT, who’s offering to buy 23,300
shares at $25.63. If you look at the right pane, you can see that ARCA is offer-
ing to sell 17,700 shares of MSFT at $25.64. (Unlike Lehman Brothers, which is
a market maker, BRUT and ARCA are electronic communication networks

[ECNs] and are likely representing customer orders and not market maker
activities. You can read more about ECNs in Chapter 1.) The bid/ask spread
is only one cent, and the number of shares offered at the bid and ask are
large. This security has significant depth. A swing trader placing a market
order is unlikely to move the security an inch.
Verifying the accuracy of quotes with the Time & Sales report
Market makers play games to cover their true intentions on how many shares
they’re bidding on or offering for sale. They realize that if they show their
hand too much, then traders will react to that information and make their
lives more difficult. Your task is to determine whether their stated intentions
are consistent with their actions.
The Time & Sales report (shown in Figure 11-3 and available from most
brokers and real-time charting packages) shows the actual buys and sells
that occur during the trading day. Sometimes market makers try to deceive
other traders on what their intentions are and whether they’re aggressive
buyers or sellers in the market — or whether they’re indifferent. So keep
an eye on the Time & Sales report, and monitor whether trades are being
executed at the asking price, the bid price, in between the bid and ask, or
outside of the bid or ask.

The Time & Sales report is helpful when used in conjunction with the Level II
quote screen, which shows posted prices by market makers, because the
Time & Sales report shows actual trades. These facts help tell you whether
market participants are bluffing. For example, a market maker may post a
large sell order on behalf of a client so as to scare others into selling to him
or her at lower prices. Using the Time & Sales report and Level II quote
screens together can tell you whether
(cid:2) Buyers are more aggressive than sellers: This scenario is likely the case
if there are major buyers on the bid with large share sizes, and the
shares offered on the ask side are small in comparison. If the Time &
Sales report shows executions at the ask price (or above it), you have
confirmation that buyers are more aggressive.

(cid:2) Near-term price pressure is coming: This situation tends to happen if
large share sizes are being offered on the ask by multiple market
makers, and the share sizes offered on the bid are small. Confirm price
weakness with the Time & Sales report where trades should be occur-
ring at or below the bid price.
Swing traders who incorporate Level II analysis into their trading systems
often look for signs of short-term strength or weakness to improve their
timing. In such cases, the Time & Sales report must be read in conjunction
with the changing quote system.
In fast-moving markets, the report moves quickly. Trades may occur at the
bid, at the ask, in between the bid and ask, or outside the bid and ask. When
trades are executing at the ask, that’s a sign of short-term price strength.
When trades are executing at the bid, that’s a sign of short-term price
weakness.

emember those times in high school or college when your teacher
explained some pretty technical concepts that seemed to fly right over
your head? (If this doesn’t apply to you, congratulations, you’re a genius in
my book.) I can recall several subjects, both boring and exciting, that I never
fully understood, even as the concepts were being explained.
However, when I heard the teacher say, “Let’s walk through an example,” my
eyes lit up. Examples bring color to concepts. They elucidate fine points that
can’t really be fully understood without practical application.
Consider this chapter your own “Let’s walk through an example” moment.
Here, I take the view of the swing trader looking for a trading opportunity,
and this chapter provides an example of identifying a potential trade by
going through the eight major steps. These steps show you how to integrate
concepts covered in other parts of this book. I use the top-down analysis
framework (see Chapters 6 and 8) to identify and execute the trade, and all
the data I use is actual market data. If you see how I approach and research
potential candidates to swing trade, you can build on the techniques I
present or incorporate aspects you agree with.
Step 1: Sizing Up the Market
Mr. Market is where all things start for the swing trader. You have to know
the state of the equity, commodity, fixed income, and even currency markets
to be a savvy trader. Why? Because these markets are related. For example,
1199__229933668833--cchh1122..iinndddd 224477 77//2288//0088 66::5599::2200 PPMM

==================================================

248
Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
if you notice that currency prices are rising, you should be prepared for a
bear market in bond prices. Or if you see bond prices falling rapidly, you’re
likely to see weakness in equities. Rising oil prices positively affect shares of
energy companies; the weakening dollar helps boost commodity prices; and
so on. Watching all major markets improves your trading ability by giving
you an indication of the likely direction of other markets.
Because you’re likely to trade equities, you may want to closely examine
U.S. equity markets to determine which style (growth or value) is performing
well and which market cap ranges (large cap, mid cap, or small cap) lead the
market. The best way to achieve this analysis is through relative strength
charts, which plot one index versus another (see Chapter 6).
Looking for short-term trends
on the daily chart
At the time I’m writing this, the date is April 4, 2008. I want to analyze how
the equity markets look. Figure 12-1 shows a snapshot of a daily chart of the
S&P 500 Index in late 2007 and early 2008. Also plotted are the MACD indica-
tor and the 17-day moving average. The 17-day moving average smoothes out
price changes and helps determine short-term market direction.
When I examine any market, I ask myself whether the market is in a trading
range or trend. Figure 12-1 shows a market that’s in a trading range. However,
it looks to be entering a trend. Notice any familiar chart patterns on the far
right of the screen? (Check out Chapter 4 for a refresher on popular chart
patterns.)

==================================================

249
Chapter 12: Walking through a Trade, Swing-Style
I see a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (I’ve listed the left
shoulder as “LS,” the right shoulder as “RS,” and the head as “Head”).
This formation is bullish and is near completion, which argues for higher
prices near-term. Also notice that the slope of the 17-day moving average is
positive. Finally, the MACD plot is above the 0 line, indicating that the 12-day
exponential moving average is above the 26-day exponential moving average
(see Chapter 5 for more information). All these factors argue for short-term
price strength.
Analyzing the weekly chart
for longer-term trends
One chart’s time frame isn’t sufficient for your analysis. You must also look at
the weekly chart to determine whether the longer trend is up or down.
The weekly chart in Figure 12-2 shows the S&P 500 Index in late 2006
through early 2008, along with the 17-week moving average and the weekly
MACD. The intermediate trend is down, as measured by the 17-week moving
average’s negative slope. However, the short-term trend is up, as indicated
by the rising MACD histogram (a facet of the MACD indicator explained in
Chapter 5).
The weekly chart shows conflicting data. The daily chart shows a market
with a rising 17-day moving average, a rising MACD signal line, and a poten-
tial inverse head-and-shoulders pattern — all bullish items. The weekly chart,
on the other hand, shows a falling 17-week moving average, meaning that the
intermediate trend is down.

250
Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
But the weekly MACD histogram is rising, which indicates short-term price
strength. Because swing traders have short-term time horizons, they should
trade in the direction of the short-term trend. You can always adjust quickly
to the other side of the market should the short-term trend turn down and be
consistent with the intermediate trend. But the weekly chart indicates that
caution is warranted. The intermediate trend can exert itself at any time.
Keep stop loss orders tight.
If you’re primarily trading stocks, then analyzing other asset classes may
help you identify which sectors to focus on and whether to trade the long
or short side of the market. For example, when the yields on government
bonds become significantly higher than the earnings yield of the S&P 500
Index (see Chapter 8 for a full explanation of how to calculate this), stock
prices may come under pressure as money flows into higher yielding assets.
This first step shows a mixed market. The short-term trend is up, but the
intermediate trend is down. You should focus on trading candidates on
the long side. The market is in rally mode, and you want to ride the wave.
Perform a similar type of analysis in the bond, currency, and commodity
markets.
Step 2: Identifying the
Top Industry Groups
In the example I began in the previous section, the short-term trend is up, so
you should look for new positions on the long side of the market. To do so,
you need to examine the leading industry groups. Buying stocks in leading
groups increases the chances your stock will rise with the overall market.
You can identify leading industry groups in several ways. Investor’s Business
Daily publishes a ranking of all industry groups in the market. You can focus
on that list’s top 10 percent to identify stocks on the long side of the market.
High Growth Stock Investor (HGS Investor) is a software program that provides
a ranking of the leading/lagging industry groups and allows users to plot each
industry group. Analyzing industry group charts is a step up from simply
focusing on the top 10 percent because you can apply the technical analysis
tools I cover in Chapters 4 and 5.
Figure 12-3 shows a chart of the top-performing industry groups from
early February through late April 2008. The groups are ranked in order of
performance. For example, the Construction Residential/Commercial Index
is ranked 99 for the week of April 4, which means it outperformed 99 percent
of all industry groups. Put another way, it performed in the top 1 percent
among all groups.
1199__229933668833--cchh1122..iinndddd 225500 77//2288//0088 66::5599::2222 PPMM

So what this step tells you is that you should start your search for promising
swing trades in the industry groups ranking in the top 10 percent for long
candidates and the bottom 10 percent for short candidates.
Now that you know which groups are leading, look for candidates in the top
two industry groups: Construction Residential/Commercial and Steel
Producers. The following section takes you through that step.
Step 3: Selecting Promising Candidates
Knowing which industry groups to focus on is really half the battle, so you
cover most of your assessment in just the first two steps. Your success is
driven more by which side of the market you trade and the industry groups
you select than by which company you select in an industry.
So how do you choose promising candidates on the long side of the market in
the two industry groups cited in the preceding section? Most swing traders
primarily use technical analysis to select a security. I recommend you use
fundamental analysis first to select the most promising candidates. Then use
technical analysis to time your entries and exits.

==================================================

252
Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
I want to stress the importance of considering a company’s fundamentals:
Even if it’s simply ranking companies in an industry by their PEG ratios
(the lower the better, as explained in Chapter 9) or taking the Earnings Rank
provided by Investor’s Business Daily, HGS Investor, and other products, you’re
better off incorporating some type of fundamental approach in your swing
trading versus no fundamental analysis at all.
Screening securities
Before you select a company to trade, be sure to apply some filter to the secu-
rity both on the long and short side of the market within the industry group
you’re analyzing. This screen (see Chapter 8 for more on how to use screens)
is primarily designed to filter out thinly traded securities (those that carry sig-
nificant liquidity risk) and penny stocks (which I define as stock trading below
$5 per share). I recommend the following simple screen, which I use regularly:
(cid:2) Stock price ≥ $5
(cid:2) Average daily volume ≥ 100,000 shares
(cid:2) Market capitalization ≥ $250 million
Applying this screen to the Construction Residential/Commercial industry
group narrows the list down to 17 companies, whereas applying the filter to
the Steel Producers group leaves 14 companies.
Ranking the filtered securities
and assessing chart patterns
After applying a filter to the securities on both sides of the leading and lag-
ging industry groups, rank the remaining securities by some measure — a
fundamental one (such as return on equity) or a technical one (such as days
since last DMI crossover, covered in Chapter 5). Then review the securities in
that industry and isolate the ones that meet your entry criteria (which should
be simple and clear, free of subjective interpretations).
In general, I prefer to rank securities by price to cash flow ratio or earnings
rank. Then I go through the stock charts of the leading securities and look for
the stocks with the most promising chart patterns. I find that this two-step
process works best because it begins with fundamentally strong companies
and then looks for attractive charts. If you begin with attractive charts, you’re
going to have a tougher time finding fundamentally promising companies
among the strongest charts because you’ll be unable to quickly rank the
fundamentals of any prospects to other candidates. (In other words, it’s
easier to find strong charts among undervalued companies than it is to find
undervalued companies among strong charts.)

Chapter 12: Walking through a Trade, Swing-Style
So that’s how I go about ranking securities, but your method may vary. You
can approach this process in literally an endless number of ways, and no one
way is right. The important thing is that your method is based on principles
that you agree with and that lead to strong performance.
Chapters 4 and 5 take you through finding securities from the technical
side of the market, whereas Chapters 7, 8, and 9 take you through the
fundamental steps. In this section, though, I walk you through the process
I’d follow if I were trading these securities.
Narrowing your list of prospects
Ranking securities pushes the cream to the top. For this trade, I’ve ranked
the securities in both industry groups by return on equity (which is covered
in Chapter 8). The results are shown in Figure 12-4.

Handpicking the lucky ones
After you rank the securities you zone in on, go through the stock charts to
identify criteria that meet your trading strategy. What you look for depends
on what you’ve decided to incorporate into your trading plan. Perhaps you’re

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
looking for moving average crossovers in the presence of strong volume. Or
maybe you’re looking for cup-and-handle formations. Your trading rules need
not be complex.
In fact, simple entry rules trump more complex ones. Buying when the
moving average slope turns positive, for example, can be an effective entry
criterion. Or you can buy when the MACD line crosses the 0 line. But more
complex entry techniques can also work well. Perhaps you implement a trad-
ing indicator you read about in a trade magazine, or you wait to trade on
divergences between an indicator and the share price. Whatever the method,
make sure your entry criteria are clear and not subjective. You don’t want an
entry method that gives ambiguous signals or relies on someone’s interpreta-
tion to determine whether to buy. Subjective analysis is risky because it
opens up trading to inconsistent behavior.
For the purposes of this example, I’ll buy a security when the MACD line
crosses above its signal line, and I’ll exit when the security closes below its
nine-day moving average. To be more precise, I’m not looking for securities
where the MACD line is simply above its signal line — several securities meet
that rather loose criterion. No, I’m looking only for those securities with MACD
lines above signal lines today. (You should only go on green. Never jump the
gun by buying before a signal is generated and never wait and buy a few days
after a signal is given.)
After reviewing the securities listed in Figure 12-4, I find two stocks that meet
my entry criteria: Gafisa S.A. (symbol: GFA) in the Construction Residential/
Commercial group, and Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (symbol: SID) in the
Steel Producers group.
I never trade a security that’s due to report earnings in the next two weeks,
and I strongly advise you to follow this rule. As trading expert Ian Woodward
said: “You don’t have your hand on the steering wheel when you trade securi-
ties right before earnings dates.” (If you’re wondering, I confirmed that GFA
and SID aren’t due to report earnings in the next two weeks.)
GFA’s chart, shown in Figure 12-5, reveals a security that’s been in a trading
range. On the far right side of the chart, notice that the MACD line has
crossed above its signal line, meeting the entry criterion I outlined earlier.
Also notice that volume on the day of the crossover was above average. The
nine-day moving average has turned higher, but it has generated several
whipsaw signals, a sign that the stock is in a trading range.
Figure 12-6 shows a chart of SID. SID has been consolidating for a few weeks
and is breaking out of its consolidation. The MACD line is crossing over its
signal line, but volume is below average. The nine-day moving average
recently turned higher. Both are signs that the short-term trend is turning up.

Step 4: Determining Position Size
Okay, so I’ve found my trade, but how much do I allocate to it? Not all of it —
nobody’s that certain about a trade unless they have inside information, and
even then, there’s never a 100 percent guarantee that things will turn out the
way you want.
Chapter 10 outlines two different ways to set your position size: by percent of
capital (not recommended) or by risk level. Determine your position size by
identifying your stop loss level and limiting losses between 0.25 percent and
2.0 percent of your account value should the security reach that stop loss
level. For these two trades, I’m setting my position size based on a risk level.
Specifically, I’m going to calculate how many shares I can buy of GFA and SID,
assuming I place stop loss orders below a recent support level.

Setting your stop loss level
Your stop loss level is your emergency exit. Trading without one is akin to
suicide. You need to know where to get out if things turn sour.
The GFA chart (refer to Figure 12-5) has a clear support level of $33.50. If the
stock were to trade below $33.50, I believe it would be a sign that the trade
had failed. But of course, I never place stop loss orders at predictable price
levels where others may also place their orders. So I’ve decided to set my
risk level at $33.18.
1199__229933668833--cchh1122..iinndddd 225566 77//2288//0088 66::5599::2244 PPMM

Chapter 12: Walking through a Trade, Swing-Style
The SID chart (refer to Figure 12-6) has a clear support level of $35. If the
stock were to trade below $35, I believe it would be a sign that the trade had
failed. But again, I avoid placing stop loss orders at predictable price levels.
So I’ve decided to set my risk level at $34.59.
Limiting your losses to
a certain percentage
Your losses should be limited to some percentage of your total assets. Your
position size is based on that percentage. If you limit losses to 2 percent of
your total assets (an amount I consider aggressive), you should be able to
take larger trades than swing traders who limit losses to 0.5 percent of their
account values.
I’m assuming that my investment account is $100,000 and I want to limit my
risk to 1 percent of my account. Also, I’m using the closing share price on
April 4, 2008 — $38.54 — as my purchase price.
So how many shares of GFA can I buy? Here’s how the math goes:
1. Subtract the stop loss level from the purchase price.
$38.54 – $33.18 = $5.36
2. Multiply the maximum allowable risk by the investment account total.
1% × $100,000 = $1,000
3. Divide the number in Step 2 by the number in Step 1.
$1,000 ÷ $5.36 = 186 (rounded down)
Hence, I can buy 186 shares of GFA. (I recommend rounding down so you
don’t increase your risk beyond the 1 percent level).
Assuming the same account total, risk level, and purchase date as GFA, how
many shares of SID can I buy? To get the answer, I go through the same math-
ematical procedure as I did with GFA:
1. Subtract the stop loss level from the purchase price:
$39.22 – $34.59 = $4.63
2. Multiply the maximum allowable risk by the investment account total:
1% × $100,000 = $1,000
3. Divide the number in Step 2 by the number in Step 1:
$1,000 ÷ $4.63 = 215 (rounded down)
Hence, I can buy 215 shares of SID.

258
Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
Step 5: Executing Your Order
Your order entry strategy should be consistent with your swing trading time
commitment. Full-time swing traders can add an intraday trading overlay
strategy to attempt to buy at a better price (flip to Chapter 11 for more on
using this approach). Part-time swing traders should use limit orders to enter
near the closing price on the day the signal was generated.
Personally, I don’t use a secondary trading overlay for the simple reason
that I’m not looking to add value on such a micro level. My outperformance
(or alpha) should come over holding the trade for a few days or a few weeks.
Hence, I’m not as concerned about what the security is doing minute to
minute — as long as it holds above my stop loss level.
Whether you’re a full- or part-time swing trader, entering stop loss orders
(as good until cancelled so they aren’t cancelled after one day) as soon as you
execute your trades is critically important.
The only exception to this rule is for full-time traders who watch their posi-
tions during market hours, every day. Such traders can, if they so choose,
enter price alerts on their positions at levels where a stop loss order would
be entered. Using shares of SID from earlier in this chapter as an example, a
full-time swing trader may enter the stop loss level $34.59 as the level when
he or she receives an alert from TradeStation in the form of an e-mail or a
message box. After that alert is hit, the trader can execute the order, perhaps
using a Level II quote to assist in the timing of the trade.
But using such mental stop loss orders has its downsides, the biggest of
which is that exiting losing positions isn’t automated. Entering a position
isn’t as laced with emotions as exiting for a loss is. When you have to sell a
losing position (or cover a losing short position), you may start to second-
guess yourself. You may look at the chart to see whether the stop loss level
was set too aggressively. Perhaps there’s a support level a few points below
the current price and you’d prefer to nudge down the stop loss level. And
then perhaps while you’re thinking about this, you notice that the price
has temporarily recovered above the stop loss level. “See, I knew this was
probably going to turn around.” Before you know it, you’ve come up with
perfect excuses on why you should let it run farther and cut losses at some
other level.
That’s why I prefer automated stop loss levels. Yes, entering a stop loss
level does officially post my order for all to see. But I’ll take that cost over
the possibility of letting my emotions influence my exit from a losing posi-
tion. The stop loss order does its job, no emotions involved. It executes, and
you’re notified after it happens.

Chapter 12: Walking through a Trade, Swing-Style
Step 6: Recording Your Trade
Now that I’ve executed my trades, my next job is to record them in my
trading journal. The more detailed your journal, the more helpful it is. On the
other hand, if you enter so much detail that you come to dread recording
your trades, you may fail to keep your journal up to date and the work will
eventually pile up. So always try to strike a balance.
In Chapter 3, I highlight the information your journal should contain — you
want to keep it simple but provide enough detail to make the journal useful.
Figure 12-7 shows a snapshot of a journal entry for SID.

ing journal

Step 7: Monitoring Your Shares’ Motion
and Exiting When the Time is Right
After you enter your positions and record them in your trading journal, you
should monitor them and focus on your exit strategy, which should tell you
when to exit in three scenarios:
1199__229933668833--cchh1122..iinndddd 225599 77//2288//0088 66::5599::2244 PPMM

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
(cid:2) When the position is profitable
(cid:2) When the position is unprofitable
(cid:2) When the position meanders sideways
My exit strategy in this example, like my entry strategy, is simple:
(cid:2) Ideally, I exit on a close below the nine-day moving average. If shares
rally, the close below the nine-day average will keep me on an uptrend.
(cid:2) If and when shares hit their stop loss level, I exit, pronto.
(cid:2) If shares meander and do nothing, I exit after ten days so I can deploy
the capital elsewhere.
Going back to the examples from earlier in this chapter, right after I pur-
chased shares of GFA, the stock began declining (see Figure 12-8). Within
four days, it was trading below its nine-day moving average, triggering an exit
based on the strategy I outlined. I purchased shares at $38.54 and exited
around $35.92, a loss of 6.8 percent. However, the position sizing step of my
strategy (remember, I only purchased 186 shares) limited the extent to
which this position affected my account — I lost only 0.5 percent of my entire
portfolio, which is an acceptable loss.
The SID trading position turned out differently (see Figure 12-9). Shares of SID
rose right after my entry and, as of the date of this writing, haven’t triggered
one of my established sell rules. The position has gained 10.66 percent since
my entry, or 0.9 percent for my total portfolio.

Step 8: Improving Your
Swing Trading Skills
No swing trader is perfect, and no trading system works 100 percent of the
time. You’ll always suffer losses — they’re unavoidable. You must expect
losses and work them into your swing trading strategy. Many a good system
has been corrupted by an ambitious swing trader tinkering with this and that,
trying to achieve a success rate that’s simply unrealistic.
But that doesn’t mean you can’t improve your system. One way to refine your
system and become a better trader is to review your journal entries monthly
to detect patterns in your winning or losing positions. But don’t change your
trading plan often or because of one or two losing trades. Alter your plan
only in response to a pattern of losses that you think can be improved upon,
or in response to a significant — or potentially significant — loss (such as 5
percent or more of your total account value). For instance, if your losses are
large, you likely need to adjust your risk management strategy as opposed to
your entry and exit strategy.
Returning to the example from earlier in this chapter, I’m going to review the
losing GFA trade with an eye on improving my trading strategy. When I look
at the GFA position (see Figure 12-10), I see that shares are in a trading range.
Notice that the daily ADX indicator is at 11.27 on entry, signaling a non-
trending market (for more on the ADX indicator, check out Chapter 5). The
weekly ADX (not shown in the chart) is even worse: 12.19 at entry. When
the ADX rises above 20, a trend is in place. The ADX indicator in shares of
GFA is communicating something very different.
1199__229933668833--cchh1122..iinndddd 226611 77//2288//0088 66::5599::2255 PPMM

My trading strategy is based on riding trends. As a result, I may improve my
trading plan by filtering out securities that aren’t clearly trending. Perhaps I
could improve my strategy by filtering out securities where the weekly ADX
indicator is below 20.
Why did I choose to use the weekly ADX versus the daily ADX to filter out
non-trending stocks in my trading plan? Technically, this is just a preference.
Either strategy will work. But I noticed that shares of SID had an ADX value of
16 on entry. Filtering out stocks with daily ADX values below 20 excludes SID
as well as GFA. However, filtering out stocks with weekly ADX values below
20 excludes GFA but not SID, the profitable trade. That’s why reviewing not
only your losing positions but also your profitable ones is important.

A
re you a swing trading star or a work in progress? The only way to
know is by calculating your portfolio’s returns. Admittedly, doing so
isn’t the most exciting task. But as a swing trader, you must compute your
returns to find out whether you’re doing an amazing job or a lousy one.
Performance calculation can be complicated by several factors, including
taxes, commissions, SEC fees, and other expenses. Cash deposits or with-
drawals, which I cover later in this chapter, also complicate the process
of figuring your returns. Your job is to account for such complications
accurately so that your return figures solely reflect your skill. Return miscal-
culations can lead to unskilled traders thinking they’re hot stuff (see a real-
life example of this embarrassment in the Beardstown Ladies sidebar later in
this chapter) or skilled traders thinking they aren’t making the grade.
Although some brokers offer performance calculation, far too many simply
report the account balances at month’s end, which fails to remove the
distorting effects of cash flows. If your broker computes performance, find
out whether the performance figures are time weighted. If they are, you can
use them.
No Additions, No Withdrawals?
No Problem!
The simplest return calculation occurs when an account begins at a certain
asset level, experiences no withdrawals or deposits, and appreciates or

depreciates over time solely due to trading in the account. To calculate your
returns in this situation, use the following formula:
EndingMarketValue–BeginninggMarketValue
TotalReturn =
BeginningMarketValue
Here’s a quick example to illustrate this performance calculation.
On December 31, 2009, Trader Claire’s account value is $86,430. Trader Claire
swing trades in the first three months of 2010, buying and selling different
stocks every few days. By March 31, 2010, Trader Claire’s account value has
reached $92,872. During the first three months, Trader Claire made no depos-
its or withdrawals from her account. The ending account value reflects all
commissions Trader Claire paid in the first three months, but it doesn’t
reflect taxes because she’s trading in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA),
a tax-deferred investment account. What is Trader Claire’s total return during
the period? If you plug these account values into the preceding equation, you
find that her return was 7.45 percent:
$92,872−$86,430
7.45% =
$86,430
Although this equation is the simplest return calculation equation, swing
traders may be depositing and withdrawing assets periodically, which
requires adjustments to the formula. To figure out how to calculate your
return in such a situation, see the later section “Accounting for Deposits and
Withdrawals: The Time-Weighted Return Method.”
Comparing Returns over Different Time
Periods: Annualizing Returns
The return calculated in the preceding section represents a return over a
specified time period. The return calculation remains the same whether the
beginning and ending values are three months apart or three years apart.
However, you can’t really compare a return achieved over three years to one
achieved over three months. That’s why the investment management indus-
try usually calculates annualized returns, or returns converted to an annual
basis. You can think of annualized returns as an average return. For example,
a 50 percent return over a five-year period is roughly equivalent to an annual
return of 10 percent.

Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Performance
I say roughly because the actual annualized return is less than 10 percent due
to compounding — or generating earnings on reinvested earnings. I’m just
using an average to illustrate the concept. I show you how to calculate the
actual annualized return with a tale of two traders who are arguing about
who has superior investment skills.
Trader Hot Stuff is convinced his return of 76.23 percent achieved over a five-
year period is superior to the return of his friend, Trader Humble, who
achieved a return of 52.09 percent over a three-year period. So who’s right?
To find out, you must convert both traders’ returns into annual returns,
which you can do by completing the following steps:
1. Compute the return over the specified time period.
Assuming no withdrawals or deposits were made, calculate the return
over the time period using the equation shown in the preceding section.
(If deposits or withdrawals did occur, use the time-weighted return
calculation method I describe in the later section “Accounting for
Deposits and Withdrawals: The Time-Weighted Return Method.”)
In the case of Trader Hot Stuff and Trader Humble, the return has already
been calculated over the time period for both traders. The returns are
76.23 percent over five years and 52.09 percent over three years.
2. Add 1 to the return calculated in Step 1.
Returns are expressed in percentages, so if you want to add 1 to a per-
centage, you have to convert the percentage into decimal form. Trader
Hot Stuff had a return of 76.23 percent, which equals 0.7623 in decimal
form. Trader Humble had a return of 52.09 percent, which equals 0.5209
in decimal form. Adding 1 to both returns yields 1.7623 for Trader Hot
Stuff and 1.5209 for Trader Humble.
3. Determine what time-period conversion fraction you should use to
convert the return into an annual return.
Use the following equation to calculate the fraction:
Timeperiodyouwanttoconvertreturninto
(Usuallyexxpressedinmonthsoryears)
Time-PeriodConversionFraction =
Timeperiodretturniscurrentlyexpressedin
(Mustusesammeunitofmeasurementasnumerator)
• The numerator in this fraction will always be either 12 (months), 1
(year), or 4 (quarters). Whether you use 12, 1, or 4 in the numera-
tor depends on what time period the return you computed in Step
1 is measured in.
• The denominator is equal to the time period covered by the return
in Step 1. Make sure that the denominator’s unit of measurement
(months, years, or quarters) is equal to the numerator’s unit of
measurement.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
For Trader Hot Stuff, the numerator is 1 because the return is in years,
and the denominator is 5 because the time period is five years. So
Trader Hot Stuff’s time-period conversion fraction is 1/ 5. For Trader
Humble, the numerator is 1 because the return is in years, and the
denominator is 3 because the time period is three years. So Trader
Humble’s time-period conversion fraction is 1/ 3.
4. Raise the figure computed in Step 2 to the fraction calculated in
Step 3.
You need a scientific calculator for this computation. (If you don’t own
one but have access to a PC, the computer’s built-in calculator, which
is under “Accessories,” can be used as a scientific calculator by clicking
on “View” and selecting “Scientific.”) For Trader Hot Stuff, raising the
answer from Step 2 to the fraction from Step 3, you get 1.76231/

= 1.15000.
5. Subtract 1 from the figures in Step 4 and convert the result into a
percentage.
The final step produces the annualized return that you’re looking for.
After you subtract 1, convert the result into a percentage by moving the
decimal point two places to the right.
For Trader Hot Stuff, the calculation looks like this: 1.11999 – 1 =
0.11999 = approximately 12 percent when you move the decimal. For
Trader Humble, 1.15000 – 1 = 0.15000 = 15 percent.
So Trader Hot Stuff achieved an annualized return of 12 percent over the
five-year period, whereas Trader Humble achieved an annualized return of 15
percent over the three-year period. Trader Humble’s annualized return is 3
percent greater, on an annualized basis, than Trader Hot Stuff’s return.
Now that you know how to compute annualized returns, I must throw out this
word of caution. Never — ever — annualize a return that spans a time period
of less than a year. Doing so can lead to ridiculous returns that don’t reflect
what can normally be achieved in a year. For example, a return of 10 percent
in a month is equivalent to an annualized return of 214 percent. That’s not
exactly a realistic objective.
Accounting for Deposits and
Withdrawals: The Time-Weighted
Return Method
If you don’t make any deposits to or withdrawals from your investment
account, the return calculation is straightforward. Simply determine the

positive or negative change in account value and divide that by the initial
account value, as I show you in the equation in “No Additions, No
Withdrawals? No Problem!” earlier in this chapter. But if you do make depos-
its and/or withdrawals, the returns on that account are more difficult to mea-
sure and require a few more steps to calculate.
For example, if you start with $100,000 in capital, swing trade for a few
months, and then deposit an additional $50,000, how do you account for the
growth in assets? Part of the growth may be due to your swing trading
profits. But part of the growth is also attributable to the additional deposit.
If you end the year with an account value of $200,000, you can’t calculate
your return simply by backing out the $50,000 deposit and then plugging the
other numbers into the formula. Remember, that $50,000 may have grown or
declined in value, and that change in value has to be reflected in your return
calculation. The nearby Beardstown Ladies sidebar illustrates the perils of
failing to properly account for these cash additions.
When deposits and withdrawals occur in an account, you can calculate
returns in two ways:
(cid:2) The time-weighted return method: This method calculates the
account’s return independent of any cash flows. Because time-weighted
returns are computed irrespective of the timing of cash flows, they’re a
better measure of a manager’s skill than money-weighted returns.
(cid:2) The money-weighted return method: This method figures the return
based on the return of the account and the value added due to the
timing of cash flows.
In the investment management industry, the time-weighted return method is
more widely accepted because it removes the distorting effects that can arise
when large cash flows come into or out of an account. For that reason, I
devote this section to using that method.
One way of calculating time-weighted returns is to break a portfolio out by
the dates of withdrawals and deposits and then calculate the returns for each
time period in between these cash flow events using the formula shown in
this chapter’s first section. To do this, you need to know the value of the
portfolio right before each deposit or withdrawal occurs. After computing the
returns for the smaller time periods, you can string together the returns
through a process known as geometrically chain-linking the returns. That
sounds much worse than it actually is — I promise. I break it all down in the
following sections.

Breaking the time period into chunks
The number of deposits and withdrawals you make in an account determines
the number of time periods for which you need to calculate returns. You
simply take the number of these cash flow events and add 1. So if you have
four different deposits and withdrawals, you need to calculate returns for five
discrete time periods, as the following example illustrates.

(cid:2) Ending value on December 31: $68,350
So what’s the return of this swing trader’s account for the year?
First, split the year into distinct periods in between each deposit and with-
drawal, as shown in Figure 13-1. Because the account experienced four differ-
ent cash flow events, you should come up with five distinct time periods:
(cid:2) Time Period 1: January 1–February 15
(cid:2) Time Period 2: February 16–April 18
(cid:2) Time Period 3: April 19–June 8

Calculating the return for each time period
Next, calculate the return for each subperiod by using the formula shown
earlier in this chapter. Here’s the computed return for each subperiod for
Swing Trader Singh’s account:
(cid:2) Return for Subperiod 1: ($58,500 – $50,000)/$50,000 = 17 percent
(cid:2) Return for Subperiod 2: ($61,300 – $63,500)/$63,500 = –3.46 percent
(Add the deposit of $5,000 on February 16 to the account value right
before the deposit to get the starting value for Subperiod 2.)
(cid:2) Return for Subperiod 3: ($63,780 – $58,300)/$58,300 = 9.40 percent
(Subtract the withdrawal of $3,000 on April 19 from the account value
right before the withdrawal to get the starting value for Subperiod 3.)

Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Performance
(cid:2) Return for Subperiod 4: ($72,290 – $72,780)/$72,780 = –0.67 percent
(Add the deposit of $9,000 on June 9 to the account value right before
the deposit to get the starting value for Subperiod 4.)
(cid:2) Return for Subperiod 5: ($68,350 – $65,290)/$65,290 = 4.69 percent
(Subtract the withdrawal of $7,000 on December 16 from the account
value right before the withdrawal to get the starting value for
Subperiod 5.)
Now that you have the returns for the subperiods, all that’s left to get the
return for the entire period is to chain-link the subperiod returns together.
Chain-linking time period returns
to calculate a total return
Despite what you may’ve been told growing up, it’s okay to geometrically
chain-link returns together to determine the total return for an entire
period. Chain-linking returns means combining individual returns through
multiplication.
Chain-linking returns is actually a wonderful concept. It works regardless of
whether the different subperiods are of equal length. One subperiod may
cover three days and another may cover three months. As long as they’re
separate time periods and are adjoining (that is, they cover the entire time but
don’t overlap), then you can chain-link returns to get the total return during
the period — all while ignoring the effects of cash flows.
For example, if you have the daily returns of the stock market for every single
day of the year (roughly 250 days the market is open), you can chain-link
them together to get the return for the whole year. Or if you have the return
for 11 months and 30 days of the year, you can chain-link those 41 returns
together to get the return for the entire year.
Here’s the formula for calculating chain-linked returns:
Total Return = (1 + R1) × (1 + R2) × . . . (1 + RN) – 1
R1 = Return in Subperiod 1
R2 = Return in Subperiod 2
RN = Return in Subperiod N
You can now return to the Swing Trader Singh example and use this formula
to calculate his total return over the time period. Recall that Swing Trader
Singh achieved the following returns in the five subperiods: 17 percent, –3.46
percent, 9.40 percent, –0.67 percent, and 4.69 percent.

Part IV: Developing and Implementing Your Trading Plan
Note: You must convert percentages into decimals when adding, subtracting,
or multiplying. Your final return in decimal format can then be converted back
into a percentage by moving the decimal point over two places to the right
(that is, 0.05 is equal to 5 percent).
Swing Trader Singh’s Total Return (found by chain-linking subperiod
returns)
Total Return = (1 + .17) × (1 – .0346) × (1 + .0940) × (1 – .0067) × (1 + .0469)
– 1 = 1.17 × 0.9654 × 1.094 × 0.9933 × 1.0469 – 1 = 0.285 = 28.5 percent
Comparing Your Returns to an
Appropriate Benchmark
After you know how to compute your returns, you should compare them to
some benchmark to determine whether you’re outperforming the market. But
which benchmark should you use?
If you’re trading stocks, you can look at nine major benchmarks:
(cid:2) Large Cap Growth (Russell 1000 Growth Index)
(cid:2) Large Cap Core (Russell 1000 Index)
(cid:2) Large Cap Value (Russell 1000 Value Index)
(cid:2) Mid Cap Growth (Russell Mid Cap Growth Index)
(cid:2) Mid Cap Core (Russell Mid Cap Index)
(cid:2) Mid Cap Value (Russell Mid Cap Value Index)
(cid:2) Small Cap Growth (Russell 2000 Growth Index)
(cid:2) Small Cap Core (Russell 2000 Index)
(cid:2) Small Cap Value (Russell 2000 Value Index)
You can also compare your returns to international benchmarks. Bank of
New York maintains an excellent compilation of indexes covering interna-
tional stocks that trade on U.S. markets. Visit www.adrbny.com/adr_
index.jsp to find out more.
Where do you find the returns for these indexes? The best Web site I’ve found,
hands down, is the Russell return calculator (www.russell.com/indexes/
performance/calculator/calculator.asp). It shows you the returns
for indexes covering the aforementioned nine major classes. It’s free to use
and lets you compute returns over specific time periods. The Web site also
annualizes returns automatically when you select time periods that extend
beyond one year.

Figure 13-2 shows the output from this return calculator for several Russell

If you short securities in addition to buying them, you don’t want to use the
nine major benchmarks. Instead, you should focus on an absolute level of
return — such as 15 percent annually — as your benchmark. Don’t use an
unrealistic level of absolute return, like 35 percent annually. Very few swing
traders achieve such results.

Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Performance
Remember: Set the format of the cells to the “Format Cells,” and select “Currency.” If the
appropriate units of measurement. For example, data you’re entering into a cell is a percentage,
if the data you’re entering into a cell is a dollar then right-click on that cell, go to “Format
amount, you should right-click on that cell, go to Cells,” and select “Percentage.”
After you identify the appropriate benchmark to use, compare your annual
return to the benchmark’s annual return. If you don’t have an annual return,
compare monthly returns (you can convert a 15 percent annual absolute
return level into a monthly benchmark by dividing 15 percent by 12 and
arriving at 1.25 percent).
If your return is greater than the benchmark, you’re outperforming the aver-
age return achieved in your category. This outperformance may be due to
leverage (that is, using margin), trading higher beta securities than your
benchmark (see Chapter 10), using cash well (in situations where the market
is going down) or adding real value (that is, being a skilled swing trader).
Some traders would group the last two categories together, arguing that a
skilled trader uses cash to his or her advantage.
To determine whether your outperformance is due to trading higher beta
securities, you need to compute a “risk adjusted return” and compare that
figure to the risk adjusted return of the benchmark. Common risk adjusted
returns include the Sharpe Ratio and the Information Ratio. A simple risk
adjusted return ratio can be computed by dividing your total return (during a
month or year) by the standard deviation of returns. You must have at least
30 days of returns (that is, 30 different returns on a daily basis) or 12 months
of returns for your strategy and for the benchmark in order to calculate a
simple risk adjusted return. Please note: If your benchmark is an absolute
return, there is no standard deviation associated with it.
Calculating standard deviation is outside the scope of this book, but it can be
done in Microsoft Excel using the function “=stdev(returns)”. (The “returns”
should be replaced by the actual cells containing the 12 monthly returns or
30 daily returns. For example, if your returns were in cells A1 through A30,
the function above would read “=stdev(A1:A30)” without the quotation marks.
If you don’t have Excel, you can also use the following Web site to calculate
standard deviation: invsee.asu.edu/srinivas/stdev.html.
When you have the standard deviation of monthly or daily returns for
your strategy and for your benchmark, divide each return by its standard
deviation. For example, if your strategy returned 10 percent during the year
with a standard deviation of returns of 5 percent, you’d arrive at a calculated

ratio of 2. If the benchmark returned 11 percent with a standard deviation of
returns of 6 percent, its calculated ratio is 1.83. The higher the risk adjusted
return, the better. In this example, the trader has added value relative to his
or her benchmark because 2 is greater than 1.83.
Evaluating Your Trading Plan
After you compute your account’s return and compare it to some benchmark
(see the preceding section for more info on how to do just that), you can
work on improving your trading plan (assuming it needs to be improved). If
your returns exceed the appropriate benchmark, great job! But that doesn’t
mean you shouldn’t review your trades and look for ways to refine your plan.
At least monthly, examine your trading journal and review all closed trades
(those that you’ve exited) to determine whether you need to make any
adjustments to your strategy. If your plan yields subpar returns when com-
pared to the appropriate benchmark, perhaps you can spot a common thread
among the losing positions and add a trading rule to avoid similar losses.
Conversely, if you’re consistently beating the benchmark, maybe you can
identify a common thread among your winning positions and add a trading
rule to increase the chances of finding those gainers.
Don’t change your plan too often. Only change it when you’re sure that a
tangible benefit exists and that you can address a problem you spot in several
trades. If you change your trading plan frequently, you’ll never know whether
you have a well-functioning plan because you can’t judge a plan on the basis of
a few weeks of data (unless you lose half or all your money, in which case
you’re probably not following the risk management techniques I outline in
Chapter 10). Wal-Mart and Best Buy don’t change their corporate strategies
weekly, or even yearly. They plan for the long term. Even though you’re swing
trading, your trading plan must have a long-term perspective in the sense that
it should do well across changing markets and over time.
You’ll never achieve 100 percent success in your trades. A great trading plan
may well result in a success rate of 50 percent if the profits from your winners
are multiple times larger than the losses from your losers.

Chapter 14
Ten Simple Rules
for Swing Trading
In This Chapter
(cid:1) Taking prudent steps to become a successful swing trader
(cid:1) Controlling your emotions (but still having fun)
S
wing trading can and should be enjoyable. You can actually look forward
to “working” each day! But swing trading is still a business, so you must
stick to certain rules designed to keep you in the game. After all, if you have
no capital, you can’t trade. So the most important rule is the rule of survival.
Surviving means not only managing risk but also following your own plan and
your own rules. If you’re not careful, swing trading can quickly go from being
a business about making profits to being an outlet for your emotions.
The rules in this chapter aren’t novel or complex. Instead, they’re simple and
straightforward. In fact, they’re downright boring. But they’ll keep you in the game
and (ideally) help you make money. Stray from these rules at your own risk.
Trade Your Plan
A cliché that I hear over and over again is, “Plan your trade, then trade your
plan.” I hate to regurgitate that here, but I can’t phrase it any better.
Your trading plan is your road map. It answers the following questions:
(cid:2) What is your time horizon?
(cid:2) What do you trade?
(cid:2) When do you trade (going long versus going short)?
(cid:2) How much capital do you allocate to your positions?

Trading plans must be carefully thought through and then written down. I prefer
to keep a copy of my trading plan nearby, or a digital version of the plan acces-
sible on my computer. One tool I use to make sure I follow my trading plan is a
questionnaire I developed that I always complete before I enter a position. I pro-
vide a sample questionnaire in Figure 14-1 to help get you started on following
your trading plan.
Your trading questionnaire may be more or less complex than the sample
in Figure 14-1. Either way, having such a questionnaire forces you to think
through the important issues you may overlook when you’re making deci-
sions on the fly. Stick to a trading questionnaire, as silly as you may think
it sounds, and you’ll find the success of your trades increasing. The more
errors you avoid, the more likely your trades will turn out profitable.

Chapter 14: Ten Simple Rules for Swing Trading
Follow the Lead of Industry Groups
as Well as the Overall Market
If you’re trading stocks, you want the wind at your back, meaning your trades
should be in the direction of the overall market. If the market is in a strong
bull, then the majority of your trades should be long positions. And if the
market is in bear mode, the majority of your trades should be short posi-
tions. Markets may also be stuck in trading ranges, in which case your long
and short trades will depend on whether the market is rallying within the
trading range or falling within that range.
But trading with the overall market is only part of the story. The skilled swing
trader recognizes that industry groups make a difference in a security’s
returns. When an industry group is in the top of the pack (as identified in
High Growth Stock Investor software or Investor’s Business Daily), the stocks
in that group are likely to follow suit. Conversely, when an industry group
is in the bottom of the bottom of the pack, the stocks in that group are likely
to follow suit. When the homebuilder industry group was out of favor in 2007,
you could’ve shorted practically any homebuilder and made money (see the
examples in Figure 14-2).
The industry group in which you trade is more important to your success or
failure than which company you pick in that industry group. So as a swing
trader, always trade stocks on the long side in industry groups that are rising,
and always trade stocks on the short side in industry groups that are falling.
You don’t need to complicate what rising or falling means. One simple rule is
to only trade stocks on the long side that are part of industry groups that are
above a rising 20-day moving average.

Par t V: The Par t of Tens
Don’t Let Emotions Control Your Trading!
Emotions are the biggest enemy of trading. In a sense, you’re your own worst
enemy. Traders who lose billions of dollars at major banks often start out
losing a small amount and then try to break even or prove themselves right.
Their ultimate failing lies not in their analysis or their market knowledge but
in their inability to control their emotions.
The markets aren’t personal. When you lose money, it’s not because you made
money last time. Your losses and profits are a function of your trading ability
and the markets in which you trade. The true, professional trader is a master
of his or her emotions. Profits don’t lead to extreme joy, and losses don’t lead
to extreme pessimism. If you sat across the table from a professional trader,
you wouldn’t be able to tell whether he or she were up $50,000 or down
$100,000. Professional traders are calm and don’t let their emotions take over
their cognitive functions.
Another factor in controlling your emotions is keeping tabs on your trades.
Don’t brag to others about your profits. Don’t tell others about any trades
you’re in at the moment. Do so and you become married to your positions. If
you tell your best friends that you hold shares of Oracle and you believe the
share price is going to skyrocket, you’ll be less likely to exit if the trade turns
down. “Oh no!” you may say to yourself. “Everyone knows I hold Oracle. I
can’t bail now. I’ve got to hold to prove I was right.”
Controlling your emotions isn’t something that just happens one day and you
never have to worry about it again. Rather, it’s an ongoing battle. The two
strongest emotions you’re going to face are greed and fear. When markets are
roaring in one direction and you’re riding that wave, you’ll want to hold posi-
tions longer than you need to as you amass more profits. And when markets
roar in the opposite direction and your profits evaporate, you’ll want to take
more risks to make up for those losses.
You can’t battle these emotions in any scientific way (that I know of, at least).
I’ve always imagined that a Spock-like character who’s always rational and
never lets emotions interfere with his trading would make a wonderful trader.
Unfortunately, Star Trek is a fictional story, and Vulcans don’t exist. So as a
trader, you need to review your trades carefully and practice being calm as
much as possible. Be disciplined enough to force yourself to stop trading if
you detect your emotions are affecting your trading.

Chapter 14: Ten Simple Rules for Swing Trading
Diversify!
As a swing trader, you must hold a diversified portfolio of positions. You
should have at least ten different positions, and they should be in different sec-
tors. And if you can, incorporate other asset classes in your swing trading. For
example, include real estate investment trusts (REITs), exchange traded funds
that track international markets, or commodities such as streetTRACKS Gold.
All these positions represent different ways to diversify your portfolio. Holding
more than one position reduces idiosyncratic risk (a fancy way of saying the
risk attributable to an individual company). Having long and short positions
reduces your market direction risk. And diversification allows your portfolio
to withstand market volatility — the gains from a few positions can offset the
losses from others.
Set Your Risk Level
Setting your risk level goes hand in hand with setting a stop loss level, which
I discuss later in this chapter. Entering a stop loss level is an order entry
step, but setting a risk level is an analytical part of the process. Your stop
loss order will often be at the risk level you identify in this step.
Your risk level represents the price that, if reached, forces you to acknowl-
edge that your original thesis for trading the security is wrong. You can set
your risk level based on some automatic percent level from your entry order,
but I don’t recommend this because it forces a reality on the market where
one may not exist. For example, say you automatically exit a position when a
security declines or appreciates (depending on whether you’re long or short)
by 5 percent. But why should that security stay within this 5 percent range?
What if the security’s daily volatility is 3 percent? It may hit your risk level in
a day or two just based on normal volatility.
For this reason, I recommend that you set your risk level based on support or
resistance levels. If a stock finds support at $20 frequently, set your risk level
at $19.73, for example. Don’t use a whole number for the risk level, or you may
place your stop loss order at the same price that hundreds of others place
their orders. Instead, for instance, use something like $67.37 rather than $68 if
you’re going long.
Your stop loss level should be set at your risk level. But formulating your
risk level depends on what your trading plan calls for. If you don’t want to
use some obvious support level, then use a moving average, but be pre-
pared to constantly adjust your stop loss level because the moving average
is constantly changing. The wider your risk level is (that is, the farther your
2222__229933668833--cchh1144..iinndddd 228833 77//2288//0088 77::0077::1166 PPMM

Par t V: The Par t of Tens
risk level is from your entry price), the smaller your position size. This rule of
thumb ensures you aren’t risking more than 1 to 2 percent of your total
capital because you may be entering a security that’s extended.
Swing traders who focus on trading ranges have an easier job of identifying
their risk levels. They’re looking for a continuation of an existing trading
range. Hence, a breakout above or below a resistance or support level would
signal the end of the trading range. That resistance or support level is the
most obvious risk level for the swing trader.
To sum up, always specify your risk level and make its placement logical (that
is, near a support or resistance level). And don’t exit based on some percentage
decline — like selling a position when it declines 5 or 7 percent.
Set a Profit Target or Technical Exit
I stress risk management a lot in this book. The reason is simple: You can’t
last long without it. But when it comes to profits, you must set your profit
target or technical exit.
Your profit target is often based on a previous support or resistance level.
Some swing traders set predefined profit targets of selling 50 percent of a
position after it achieves a 5 percent gain from entry and selling the other
50 percent after it reaches a 10 percent gain. When trading based on a trad-
ing pattern like a head-and-shoulders pattern, your profit target may be
determined by the projection price implied in the chart pattern.
My preference in taking profits is to rely on a signal from a technical indica-
tor rather than a preexisting support or resistance level. Some securities
trend longer and farther than anticipated, and they can be very profitable.
Hence, I prefer to exit after a security breaks below an indicator, such as
a moving average, or on a sell signal from a trending indicator. Chapter 5
covers how you can exit positions based on moving averages.
Use Limit Orders
When entering a trade, you should enter on a limit order rather than a market
order. A limit order ensures that your execution occurs at the price you specify,
whereas a market order can be filled at any price. Rarely will you encounter such
urgency to get into a trade that you’ll need to enter a market order. Moreover,
you’re unlikely to buy at the bottom of the day or sell at the top of the day. So
be patient and you may get a better price than you originally thought.

Chapter 14: Ten Simple Rules for Swing Trading
Another reason to use limit orders is to help you avoid the cost of market
impact. The larger your order size is relative to the average volume that
trades in the security on a typical day, the more likely your buy or sell order
will move a security’s price higher or lower. A market order in a thinly traded
stock may leave you with an execution that’s 2 to 5 percent above the price
the security was when you entered the order.
You can place a limit order at a price level near where shares have traded.
The intention isn’t to get lucky on some downturn in shares but to control
the average cost per share. Place a limit order slightly below recent trades
(when you’re buying) or slightly above recent trades (when you’re shorting).
Recognize that there’s always the possibility your order may not get filled. But
remember that your job is to be patient and execute your trade only when the
timing and price are right.
Use Stop Loss Orders
You may think that stop loss orders are nothing more than training wheels.
“I’m an adult. I don’t need these pesky stop loss orders. I can exit when I see
weakness.” Unfortunately, that kind of thinking may get you killed (financially
speaking, of course). Financial markets aren’t playgrounds or appropriate
places to find out who you are. Leave that to your local sports club.
Stop loss orders are necessary for several reasons — even if you watch the
market 24 hours a day, 7 days a week:
(cid:2) They help you deal with fast-moving markets. If you swing trade ten
different positions, it’s quite possible that many of them may start acting
up on the same day. And they can move fast and furious if negative news
is in the air. Because of the speed at which markets move, you need a
stop loss to save you if you’re unable to act.
(cid:2) They limit your downside. Without a stop loss order, your downside
may be all of your capital (or worse, if you’re shorting). Stop loss orders
act as protection, because they place some upper limit on the losses you
may suffer. Of course, a security could gap through your stop loss order,
but your loss would be realized then regardless of whether a stop loss
order existed.
(cid:2) They help take your emotions out of the game. When you place mental
stop loss orders, you may start to arbitrarily move your imaginary stop
loss as the markets move against you. So you plan to exit at $49.50, but
when the security trades through that price down to $49, you tell yourself
that $47.50 is a more reasonable exit point given recent market action.
You justify your change and you hold on. And your losses mount.

Par t V: The Par t of Tens
(cid:2) They give you time to take your eye off the ball. If you travel or are unable
to watch the markets on a day when you’re sick, stop loss orders ensure
that your portfolio value is preserved. If you didn’t have stop loss orders,
you’d probably fear ever being out of touch with your computer and the
markets. One or two lousy positions can quickly change a top-performing
account into a poor performer.
For these reasons, stop loss orders are essential. You’ll sleep better at night
if you know that someone is watching your positions, ready to take action if
they start acting up.
Keep a Trading Journal
Trading journals organize your thoughts and the reasons behind your deci-
sions. They should be updated after every trade you execute. If you delay
entering a trade into your journal, the trades may eventually pile up and
overwhelm you, and you may decide not to update the journal anymore.
A trading journal is your coach. By recording the reasons you enter a position,
you can review whether your assumptions are correct, and you can find
out whether your trading plan needs adjustment. For instance, perhaps you
always enter positions prematurely and need to incorporate some indicator
to prevent you from trading too soon. Or perhaps you have a tendency to
buy stocks in weak industry groups. A trading journal reveals such habits and
patterns, and you can adjust accordingly. The fun part of keeping a journal is
reviewing the major winners and major losers. I often learn more from review-
ing my losers than I do my winners. I look to replicate the winning trades in
the future and avoid the circumstances surrounding the losing trades.
Chapter 3 provides more details on what to put in your journal — the more
detailed, the better. Of course, the more detailed your journal is, the more
time you’re going to spend updating it (especially if you have trades). Sometimes
using a screen capture program can cut down on the time. Screen capture
programs allow you to capture a window on your computer and store it as an
image that can be transferred to a Word document or Excel spreadsheet. You
can take snapshots of the security’s chart and its industry group with small
amounts of written text indicating how the security was found and what trig-
gered the entry. That can be sufficient for a trading journal.

Have Fun!
This last rule may strike you as a bit off kilter. After all, earlier in this chapter
I recommended fighting your emotions and the joy or pain that comes from
gains or losses.
Yes, yes — I did say that. But this final rule goes to the heart of whether you
can be a full-time swing trader. You have to like the business. You have to
enjoy spending hours on the computer looking for candidates to buy or short.
You have to find pleasure in reading books about swing trading (especially this
one, of course).
If you have to force yourself to research positions, then swing trading may
not be for you. If logging onto your brokerage account is a painful exercise
you prefer not to do because you feel ashamed, swing trading may not be
for you. Even when you’re down, you have to be optimistic that your profits
will come soon. And that optimism helps make those profits a reality.
So enjoy swing trading and all it entails. You’ll find it can be a rewarding
experience — financially and otherwise.

Ten Deadly Sins of Swing Trading
In This Chapter

(cid:1) Remembering that too much investment in one industry or too much trading can
hurt you
(cid:1) Appreciating the value of modesty and sticking to your plans
T
o excel in swing trading, you must not only follow the rules but also
avoid harming yourself. After all, just because you speed to work every
morning without getting caught doesn’t mean you’ll get away with it today.
The same principle applies to swing trading: Committing one or more of the
sins in this chapter won’t, necessarily, bring about immediate punishment
(and by that I mean loss of account value). But you’ll eventually be called to
account for repeated infractions.
I’ve relied on my swing trading experience to develop these sins. I admit
that I’ve committed some, if not all, of them at one point in my life. But I
always regretted the actions later on. In swing trading, you are your own
worst enemy. Here, I give you the tools you need to arm yourself against the
common pitfalls of the swing trading game.
Starting with Too Little Capital
Swing trading requires a minimum level of capital to execute efficiently —
assuming you’re swing trading for a living. If you swing trade for fun, then
you may be content making an average of $500 per month. But even then,
you’re going to be facing an uphill battle if you have too little capital. Either
way, swing trading requires an investment on your part for several reasons:
(cid:2) Diversification: Spreading a small amount of capital, say $5,000, into
ten trades is tough. That means your average trade size is $500. You
may not be able to buy but five or ten shares of some securities with
such a small trade size. As a result, you may try to fix the problem by
decreasing your number of positions, but doing so increases your risk.

==================================================

Par t V: The Par t of Tens
(cid:2) Cost: Starting with $5,000 and trading securities in $500 increments
proves very costly. A round-trip commission charge of $20, for example,
is equal to 4 percent of your trade size, meaning your position must
actually rise by 4 percent before you break even!
(cid:2) Realistic target return: Good professional swing traders can reasonably
expect to make an average of 10 to 20 percent per year on their trades.
The best swing traders can do even better. If you have a small account
size, you may be unhappy with that target return. So you try to magnify
the return by employing leverage or trading options. Whatever the case,
you’re setting yourself up for certain ruin.
So how much capital do you need to get started in swing trading? I’ve tried to
provide some guidelines to fit the different types of swing traders out there.
Of course, the following are just my recommendations, not hard-and-fast rules:
(cid:2) Trading for fun: If you enjoy swing trading as a hobby, then you can
swing trade a portion of your existing assets. The restrictions outlined
earlier don’t apply if the majority of your assets are being invested
wisely (that is, they’re diversified and professionally managed). In this
case, you can trade 10 to 20 percent of your total assets as long as your
swing trading portfolio is greater than or equal to $10,000 (to cover
costs like commissions or research services).
(cid:2) Trading for retirement: If you’re swing trading your retirement account,
you’re not depending on the trades to provide you with current income. So
you can probably begin with $10,000 to $20,000 and hold 8 to 12 positions.
(cid:2) Trading for a living: If swing trading is your full-time job, then you need
to start with a reasonable size nest egg to live off of. A professional swing
trader can reasonably expect to make 10 to 20 percent per year, so if
you need to spend $5,000 per month on living expenses, your account
value needs to be between $300,000 and $600,000. (Achieving 10 percent
on $600,000 equals $60,000 per year, or $5,000 per month. But if you’re
really good, you may achieve a return of 20 percent per year on $300,000 —
equal to $60,000 per year, or $5,000 per month.)
All things considered, I find it difficult to believe that you can swing trade well
on less than $10,000. The costs of commissions, taxes, slippage, and other
factors work against you so much that you can’t generate reasonable returns.
(Slippage is the difference between what you expect to pay or receive from
a buy or sell and what you actually pay or receive from a buy or sell. Fast-
moving markets often result in increased slippage costs.)

Chapter 15: Ten Deadly Sins of Swing Trading
Gambling on Earnings Dates
It’s funny how chance can excite people. Gambling for the chance to win a
new car, beat state lottery odds, or become the next millionaire minted by
the Publishers Clearing House seems to have broad appeal.
I believe swing trading a stock one or two weeks before its earnings date is a
form of gambling. My old mentor, Ian Woodward, likens trading before earn-
ings to driving a car without your hands on the steering wheel. I’ve never
tried driving that way, but I believe it can be dangerous.
Earnings dates are, for the most part, unknown events. Unless you have some
predictive ability I lack, you can’t know with certainty whether a company will
miss its earnings mark or profit handsomely. No doubt, you can make educated
guesses by calling a company’s suppliers and customers or analyzing how its
competitors are doing. But as a swing trader, your time horizons are too short
to make a serious study of such practical issues. You’re better off avoiding
trading stocks before their earnings dates, even in the case of large cap stocks.
When you put on a new swing trade, double-check the earnings date to make
sure you aren’t getting in right before a major announcement that may cause
a significant change in price. If you’re wrong, such a loss can seriously impair
your account’s value. Of course, a company’s stock price can gap in between
earnings dates due to other issues. But you can limit your exposure to many
gaps in companies’ stock prices by avoiding trading before earnings dates.
If you want to discover when a company will report earnings, find out
when the company’s last earnings report was and add three months to that
date. Alternatively, many Web sites show upcoming earnings dates for
most any company on the market. I like Marketwatch’s Earnings page (www.
marketwatch.com/tools/calendars/earnings.asp).
After a company has reported earnings, you can generally swing trade the
stock, because the bad or good news about earnings is out.
Speculating on Penny Stocks
When I first started trading, I immediately gravitated toward penny stocks,
which I define as all U.S. stocks that trade below $5, even though other market
commentators classify them as stocks trading at $1 or less. Back in 1994, I
said to myself, “Holy crap! I can make 20 or 30 percent if the stock moves by 5
cents!” I used to print out reams of data on penny stocks to analyze and study,
feeling if I could get a few right that I’d make untold profits.

Par t V: The Par t of Tens
Unfortunately, penny stocks are the fool’s gold in the market. They look tempt-
ing but don’t lead to riches because they exhibit low liquidity and are volatile.
They’re more susceptible to rumors or message board antics, which can spike
shares up or down. (Note: An exception to this rule is international securities
that may routinely trade for a small amount of money. For example, many
Australian shares trade for less than 5 Australian dollars without the negative
stigma that accompanies U.S. securities trading below $5.)
When the Internet was just getting started, a posting on a message board for a
penny stock company could send the stock’s value shooting up or down 5 or 10
percent in a matter of seconds. Hyping or pumping stocks became common.
If you try to hype shares of Apple Inc., you’re going to find that your posting
won’t make a dent in the stock’s price, because the company trades millions
of shares per day that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But a penny
stock may trade only $50,000 worth of stock per day, so hyping or pumping
such a stock can send shares roaring or falling — even if you were right on
the trend and position sizing.
The additional risk factors associated with trading penny stocks, like the fact
that penny stocks don’t even trade on some days, make it more difficult for
you to profit. Also, the volume on penny stocks may be light, which increases
trading costs, making it that much more difficult to earn a good return on
your money. You don’t need exposure to these junk companies to be a suc-
cessful swing trader.
Penny stocks represent companies in poor financial health. Perhaps the com-
pany in question is hemorrhaging losses. Or maybe it has a mountain of debt
on its balance sheet that it can’t pay off. Whatever the ailment, a security’s
price communicates important information about the general market’s
expectations for it.
Penny stocks aren’t necessarily companies you’ve never heard of, so don’t be
lulled into a false sense of security about a security just because you recognize
its name. Otherwise you’re setting yourself up for failure. Don’t believe me?
In late 2007, penny stocks included such well-known companies as Vonage
Holdings, E*Trade Financial Corporation, Circuit City, and Blockbuster Inc.
Changing Your Trading
Destination Midflight
Imagine the problems that may arise if pilots routinely changed their minds
on their intended destination midflight. Airports wouldn’t be able to antici-
pate which planes may be landing today, passengers would likely get upset,
and the Federal Aviation Administration wouldn’t know where to begin a
rescue operation if an emergency arose.

Chapter 15: Ten Deadly Sins of Swing Trading
Swing traders sometimes commit the sin of changing trading destinations
midflight, which means changing the reason you trade a security after you’ve
initiated the trade. More often than not, a midflight change occurs because
the trade hasn’t gone your way. And rather than take a loss, you prefer to
sock that puppy into a stocking, because you know the market’s totally off in
its assessment of the company’s prospects. The problem with this approach
is that it keeps a poor-performing security in a portfolio when it should be
sold. That security’s poor performance can become worse and lead to even
larger losses.
For example, imagine you trade shares of XYZ Corporation on the long side
(that is, you buy shares for a short-term profit). Shortly after buying shares, XYZ
suffers some indigestion, and its stock price falls by 10 percent. “Hmm . . .” you
think to yourself, “XYZ is an awfully good company. Why on earth should
this stock not trade for 20 percent more than its current price?” After giving
it some thought, you decide that your swing trade of XYZ should really be a
long-term investment. No need to take that loss right now. You know it’ll turn
up in a few weeks or months — maybe years.
Swing traders fall prey to this sin often because it’s difficult to take losses.
Taking a loss means admitting loudly and clearly that you made a mistake.
And no matter how many losses you take in trading, it doesn’t get easier to
do. Taking losses when others are looking over your shoulder is that much
more difficult.
Try to mitigate the impact of this sin by framing the way you look at losses.
Like me, you may not be a gardener, but try viewing your portfolio of securities
as a growing shrub. When you wake up each morning, make sure your shrub
is looking fine and dandy with healthy, successful trades. Be aware that occa-
sionally a branch will grow the wrong way whenever a trade turns sour and
will begin to affect your shrub’s aesthetic quality. When that happens, take out
your clippers and cut that branch off for the health of your overall portfolio.
Your swing trading portfolio will have branches that need to be cut; if you let
them grow, you’re effectively changing your trade midflight. Stay focused on
growing your portfolio over time and don’t change the reasoning behind a
trade just because it doesn’t go your way. Instead, correct the problem and
move on.
Doubling Down
By doubling down, I don’t mean trying to win big at blackjack. In the swing
trading world, doubling down means doubling your investment in a trade
when the trade goes against you. This strategy may sound appealing, but it’s
fraught with danger. So why even consider doubling down? Because if you
2233__229933668833--cchh1155..iinndddd 229933 77//2288//0088 77::0077::5511 PPMM

==================================================

294
Par t V: The Par t of Tens
trade that security again and put even more money into it, a slight move in
your direction could lead to untold profits!
For instance, if you buy $10,000 worth of Apple Inc. for $100 per share, and
the stock immediately falls to $90, you’re facing a $1,000 loss. That’s not
pretty. But if you double down and buy another $10,000 worth of shares of
Apple at $90, you can gain back that $1,000 loss to break even when shares
rise to $95. By increasing your investment to the losing trade, you lower the
price the stock must rise to in order for you to gain back your prior losses.
But doing so isn’t worth the risk.
Doubling down is a double-edged sword — if shares march down more, your
losses compound because you’ve now exposed yourself to double your initial
investment. Never send good money after bad. If you have a loss on a trade, then
your original trade idea was wrong. Adding more money to the trade doesn’t
make you right (remember, though, that your trading strategy isn’t necessarily
to blame, because losses are a natural part of doing business). The emotional
reaction to get even exists at some level in everyone. If you lose money on IBM,
for example, you want to show IBM who’s boss and trade that stock the right
way. But odds are good that you’re only shooting yourself in the foot.
My friends in the investment community may pipe up right about now to
exclaim that doubling down can be an effective investment strategy for some
people. In fact, retirement professionals often advocate a version of doubling
down. Investors who have long-term time horizons don’t care about short-
term losses the way swing traders do, though. As a swing trader, you must
follow the beat of a different drummer, because you’re principally concerned
with short-term gains. Consequently, you care about short-term losses. You
don’t have the luxury of waiting three years to find out whether you’re right.
If you aren’t right in the first three days, then you probably need to exit and
move on to another trade.
On the other side, doubling up on a winning position is acceptable as long as
the new position size fits within your risk requirements. If you’re reasoning
was correct on entering a trade (and that was validated by price action when
the position became profitable), then you may wish to add to the position to
increase your profits on that trade. The opposite holds true for losing positions.
Loss is a sign that something has gone awry. Adding to a swing trade that isn’t
working is usually an act of desperation to break even.
Swing Trading Option Securities
Options give traders the right — not the obligation — to buy or sell some
security at a future date at a certain price. Options aren’t for the new trader;
most pros don’t handle them correctly either. They miscalculate how much
2233__229933668833--cchh1155..iinndddd 229944 77//2288//0088 77::0077::5511 PPMM

Chapter 15: Ten Deadly Sins of Swing Trading
risk they’re exposed to by using those pretty little financial models that
assume the future will resemble the past.
Swing trading stocks and commodities can be profitable, but short-term trading
in options is next to impossible. Options aren’t meant to be swing traded —
they’re meant to hedge risk and provide an outlet for speculators to feel alive by
leveraging their small positions. As a general rule, don’t swing trade options — I
recommend not touching them at all — for these reasons:
(cid:2) Options don’t trade often and can be expensive to purchase or sell.
The spread between the bid and the offer of option prices is wide. So if
you buy an option at the asking price, you may already be down 5 or 10
percent on your investment relative to the bid side where you could sell
your option immediately.
(cid:2) Options pose significant risk. A stock or commodity contract may fall
some percentage points but rarely hit zero. Option prices, however,
commonly end at zero when their expiration date arrives. Options
require you to be right about three different factors regarding a price
move: direction, magnitude, and timing. If you’re wrong about any of
these three factors, you’ll end up losing money — possibly all of it.
Thinking You’re Hot Stuff
If you string together several winning trades, you may start to build confi-
dence in your strategy and skills as a swing trader. Good for you! But if your
confidence turns into arrogance, you’re going to cut corners and take greater
risks. Regardless of how good you think you are, plenty of other traders are
out there who may be better informed or better prepared. A humble trader
isn’t afraid to admit mistakes. An arrogant trader thinks the market’s wrong
and he or she’s right.
One area where I’ve seen the hot-stuff factor exhibited is in a trader’s educa-
tion. Some traders falsely believe that after you know the tools of the trade,
you don’t need to figure out anything else. Yet the markets are a living organ-
ism. You need to keep up to speed on the news surrounding them and the
books pertaining to trading.
Try setting a goal for yourself to read at least one trading-related book a
month, like I do. If you’re constantly taking in new information, you’re less
prone to thinking that you’re the be-all, end-all when it comes to trading, and
you can avoid the fate of smart traders who are brilliant on an IQ level but not
in practice. These folks generate impressive returns for several years only to
quit swing trading because they can’t control risk or admit their mistakes.

Par t V: The Par t of Tens
Concentrating on a Single Sector
According to behavioral scientists, traders and investors sometimes exhibit
a familiarity bias, an investor’s tendency to invest in companies he or she
knows or feels familiar with. Often employees of publicly traded compa-
nies have a significant portion of their retirement assets invested in their
employer’s stock. Although they may feel comfortable investing in a company
they know a lot about, this bias can be dangerous because it increases the
chances that their portfolio won’t be well diversified and that their account
will experience more volatility.
Many Enron employees in the 1990s had either the majority or the entirety
of their retirement assets invested in the energy company’s stock. Had they
diversified their holdings to less-familiar parts of the market, the payoff
may’ve meant having a nest egg versus having nothing after Enron went bust.
In swing trading, familiarity bias rears its ugly head when you focus on a
sector of the market you know a lot about. A swing trader who enjoys infor-
mation technology, for example, may trade shares of Microsoft, Apple Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, and so on. Such swing traders may in fact
build a portfolio of 10 or 12 different stocks, but they don’t have diversified
investments.
Following a top-down approach to swing trading (which I explain in Chapter
8) can also lead to overinvestment in a single sector if you’re not careful. For
instance, if energy stocks are doing well, then you may be tempted to hold a
whole basket of different energy stocks, thinking your portfolio is diversified.
If you buy one stock from each of the top ten industry groups and are 70 per-
cent invested in the energy sector, your risks are high. If energy turns down
violently, those positions will all fall together.
You must diversify your portfolio across sectors and, more broadly, across
asset classes. If commodities are outperforming stocks, swing trade compa-
nies that benefit from a commodity boom while shorting other, unrelated
companies. Having both long and short positions helps insulate you from
market volatility to some extent. But you should also be careful to avoid
investing in too few sectors.
Overtrading
You may find it curious that I list overtrading as a sin in a swing trading book.
How can a swing trader possibly overtrade? Isn’t that the whole name of the
game in swing trading? Well, yes and no.

Chapter 15: Ten Deadly Sins of Swing Trading
Swing trading is principally defined by the short-term nature of the price
swings it attempts to capture. Obviously, those price swings require more
trading than the buy-and-hold investment strategy, but you should still trade
as few times as possible in order to achieve your objective. Why?
(cid:2) The more often you trade, the more work you need to do.
(cid:2) Trading entails costs, and costs hurt returns.
(cid:2) This extra work increases administrative costs (both money- and time-
based) involved with keeping track of the trades, entering them into a
journal, and reviewing them at a future date.
Swing trading is supposed to fit in the happy medium between the day trader
who slaves away over miniscule price movements and the buy-and-hold
investor who sits on his or her hands until they become numb. The more
often you trade, the more likely you’re simply trading market noise (moves
driven by nonfundamental reasons).
Buying and selling often or intraday makes your success as a swing trader
that much more difficult — so get in before a major price move and get out
after you capture it.
I can’t give you a set number of trades to place per week or per month, but on
average, your trade length should last several days to several weeks. If you’re
holding positions for shorter amounts of time, you need to examine that part
of your trading system. Are losses that force liquidation causing you to trade
this way? Or are you becoming impatient and trading in and out because
you’re looking for the elusive stock that’ll make a major move the day after
you buy it? “Keep it simple” is a saying my tenth-grade math teacher wrote on
my notebook in class one day. The same advice applies to swing trading.
Violating Your Trading Plan
If you can’t stick to your trading plan, you’re unlikely to make it as a profes-
sional swing trader. Your trading plan is your strategy. It governs how you
trade, when you trade, and how you exit. Your trading plan should impose
certain restrictions, such as how much you allocate to a single position or
how you respond to losses. Those restrictions are in place to protect your
capital, because the markets often lull people into a sense of confidence —
only to pull the rug from underneath them when they start to cut corners.
Violating your trading plan is a little like defying authority. But unlike in a
traditional job setting, where defiance involves an employee and employer,
trading plan violations are acts of defiance against yourself. You’re literally
hurting yourself, whether you know it or not.
2233__229933668833--cchh1155..iinndddd 229977 77//2288//0088 77::0077::5511 PPMM

==================================================

Par t V: The Par t of Tens
In addition to the macro problem with violating your trading plan, the other
risk is that if you violate it routinely, even in small matters, you may violate
your plan in bigger areas — such as position sizing or diversification stand-
ards. In other words, you start to think you’re above the law and can make
decisions as you see fit. Who needs a trading plan when you’re numero uno
in the market? This negligence represents a mass abandonment of time-
tested, necessary rules.
As a swing trader, worry about yourself and not others. Don’t chase spectacular
returns that competitors generate by being careless. History has shown that the
race goes not to the swift nor the battle to the strong. Success comes from a dis-
ciplined application of the trading rules that have proven themselves over time.
Of course, you can always revise trading plans if you want. Just do it outside the
market hours and for a good reason, like making changes only after reviewing
and assessing your trading journal entries. Random acts of violation (sounds like
a criminal term, I know) make deciphering the source of strengths or weaknesses
in your plan rather difficult.

Sourcing and Charting
Your Trading Ideas
Swing trading ideas typically come from bottom-up screening or top-down
searches. In this section, I present a bottom-up screening Web site (Magic
FormulaInvesting) and a top-down software tool (High Growth Stock Investor)
that can also do bottom-up screening. I also turn your attention to a useful
financial newspaper (Investor’s Business Daily) that publishes a wealth of
valuable data and a real-time charting system (TradeStation) so you can chart
your trading ideas.
Trading ideas:

Normally, I’d be turned off by a Web site that has the word “magic” in its title.
But this Web site is very different from any you’ve visited.

Swing Trading For Dummies
MagicFormulaInvesting.com is the brainchild of Joel Greenblatt, a successful
hedge fund manager. The “magic formula” that the site’s title refers to is a
simple quantitative ranking formula that Greenblatt developed. This formula
assesses securities by two measures:
(cid:2) A cheapness measure: Similar to the inverse of the P/E ratio
(cid:2) An efficiency measure: Similar to the return on equity ratio I describe in
Chapter 8
Greenblatt, who wrote a book about this formula titled The Little Book That
Beats the Market (published by Wiley), found that ranking securities solely on
these two criteria generated a list of candidates that mightily outperformed
the overall market. The formula is geared to long-term investors who are
encouraged to hold stocks appearing at the top of the formula’s rankings and
update holdings at least annually.
So how can a long-term investor-type formula serve any purpose for the
swing trader?
Well, as it turns out, these stocks are often great places to find trading ideas.
Although Greenblatt encourages his readers to be patient and wait for prom-
ising candidates to start generating healthy returns, swing traders can simply
buy those candidates that are beginning their rise and avoid those that have
yet to turn around.
The Web site — which is free to use — allows you to view the top-ranked
securities above a certain market capitalization you specify. This makes
screening for highly rated small cap stocks or highly rated large cap stocks
a cinch. After registering for the site, you’re asked to enter the minimum
market cap of the securities you’re screening for and the number of top-
ranked securities you’d like to view (25, 50, or 100). After clicking on “Go!” the
screen generates the top-ranked securities meeting these criteria.
MagicFormulaInvesting.com is a bottom-up screen that looks only at fun-
damental criteria to identify promising securities. You can start using the
screen today by logging onto www.magicformulainvesting.com.
Trading software: High Growth
Stock Investor
High Growth Stock Investor (HGS Investor) is a software tool that assists in
identifying promising candidates to buy or short. The software incorporates
both fundamental analysis data and technical analysis data. The software
can be used to identify securities using both a top-down and a bottom-up
approach.

Appendix: Resources
What I like about HGS Investor is its efficiency. Inside of five minutes, I can
determine the overall state of the financial markets and where the strength
or weakness is, industry-group-wise. This makes my job easy because I can
simply look for long or short candidates in the strongest or weakest industry
groups in the market.
To assist you in identifying which industry groups to analyze, HGS Investor
color-codes industry group rankings. Industry groups performing in the top 20
percent of the market are color-coded green. The next 20 percent of industry
groups are color-coded yellow. The industry groups ranking in the bottom 60
percent of the market are color-coded red.
HGS Investor also allows you to analyze commodities, dividend-paying securi-
ties, international securities, and value investments. Though some traders
use HGS Investor for longer-term horizons than swing traders typically would,
the software can be extremely valuable for the traditional swing trader.
You can get a free trial of HGS Investor by visiting the firm’s Web site at www.
highgrowthstock.com. An annual subscription costs around $600.
Financial newspaper with stock ideas:
Investor’s Business Daily
Investor’s Business Daily (IBD) is a financial newspaper geared toward the
short-term trader. The newspaper offers stock ideas daily (primarily long)
and combines fundamental and technical criteria in its quantitative ranking
measures for nearly every company that trades on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and the
American Stock Exchange. IBD has an affinity for small cap companies gener-
ating strong earnings growth and flying under the radar screen of most asset
managers. Often, IBD highlights infant companies before they become huge.
You can use IBD as a source of trading ideas. Each day, the newspaper high-
lights companies making new highs — often ripe territory for finding promising
long candidates. IBD also highlights securities that have just emerged from
bases and may be ripe for purchase. IBD is built around the top-down trading
philosophy and emphasizes strong industry groups and strong stocks within
those groups. The newspaper favors growth-oriented securities over value-
oriented securities.
IBD can also assist you in selecting companies with strong (or weak) funda-
mental and technical criteria. IBD provides a wealth of information on thou-
sands of stocks every day, including such data as the following:

(cid:2) Earnings per Share Growth Rating: This fundamentals-based ranking
compares a firm’s earnings growth history to the other companies in the
market. The higher the earnings growth relative to the overall market,
the higher the EPS rating. The scale runs from 1 to 99. As a swing trader,
you should focus on buying companies with EPS ratings of 80 or higher.
(cid:2) Relative Price Strength Rating: This may be viewed as a technical ranking
because it compares the price performance of a security to all securities
in the market. The higher the rating, the better the security has performed
relative to the market. The lower the rating, the worse the security has
performed relative to the market. This scale also runs from 1 to 99, but
you want to focus on buying companies with RS ratings of 80 or higher.
(cid:2) Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity: IBD attempts to simplify fun-
damental analysis for you by crunching these figures and generating a
grade of either A, B, C, D, or E. Of course, an A rating is assigned to com-
panies with superior sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity
ratios as measured against other firms in the market. Swing traders
should focus on buying companies with a rating of A or B. Avoid buying
companies with a rating of D or E.
(cid:2) Accumulation/Distribution last three months: According to IBD, this
rating measures “relative degree of institutional buying (accumulation)
and selling (distribution) in a particular stock over the last 13 weeks.”
Translated into English, this rating looks at whether investors are buying
shares en masse or selling shares en masse. Although IBD doesn’t disclose
the actual formula, it’s safe to say that the measure compares volume on
days a security closes higher to volume on days a security closes lower.
As with the previous rating, stick to companies on the long side of the
market with Accumulation/Distribution ratings of A or B and avoid buying
companies with Accumulation/Distribution ratings of D or E. Stocks rated
C are showing neither strong accumulation nor strong distribution.
(cid:2) IBD Composite Rating: Finally, IBD publishes a Composite Rating that
sums up a security’s score on the aforementioned criteria and adds
in a security’s industry group ranking. The Composite Rating ranges
between 1 and 99. As with the Earnings per Share Growth Rating and the
Relative Price Strength Rating, I recommend buying stocks with an IBD
Composite Rating of 80 or higher.

TradeStation is more than just a trading software tool. When the company
was founded, charting and indicators were its bread and butter. TradeStation
allows users to tap one of the dozen indicators that come prepackaged in the
program or design their own trading indicators. By using those indicators,
you can develop and backtest your trading strategies.
TradeStation now incorporates brokerage with the charting platform. It allows
users to trade futures, equities, options, and even the foreign exchange market.
What I appreciate about the program is the ability to monitor positions in
real time and put trading alerts on every position I hold. For example, if
I’m long shares of IBM and want an alert if shares trade at a price of $110, I can
automate that in TradeStation and have an e-mail sent or alert signaled if
my criterion is met. I place such alerts on every position I hold and on
candidates I’m looking to trade.
TradeStation has won broker awards from the financial newspaper Barron’s
and the trading magazine Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities. You
can learn more about the program by visiting www.tradestation.com. The
TradeStation platform is free to brokerage clients who do a minimum number
of trades a month (check with TradeStation to find out what that minimum is).
Doing Your Market Research
Swing traders should always be sharpening their pencils. They should know
what’s going on in the macroeconomic environment. For example, are interest
rates high or low? Is the Fed concerned about inflation or economic growth?
Is the U.S. dollar strengthening or weakening? You can keep abreast of these
big-picture questions by staying on top of the latest news from financial
publications. I recommend the following two.
PIMCO’s Bill Gross commentary
The Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) is the largest fixed
income investment firm in the world. As of December 31, 2007, PIMCO managed
some $750 billion in assets and employed nearly 1,000 people. William H. Gross
founded PIMCO in 1971 and eventually sold the company to a German-based
insurance firm for a tidy profit. Today, Gross manages the largest bond fund in
the world, the PIMCO Total Return Fund. Prior to entering the financial world,
Gross was a professional blackjack player in Las Vegas — a profession he says
helped prepare him for Wall Street because the game focuses on calculating the
odds of success and spreading risk appropriately.

Swing Trading For Dummies
Each month, Gross publishes an investment outlook piece. Although this
outlook is unlikely to provide short-term trading ideas, Gross does identify
major themes occurring in the financial markets. These themes may play out
over the coming weeks, months, or even years, but being aware of them can
be profitable. Gross is a fundamentals-based investor, and knowing the “why”
behind Fed decisions or economic growth patterns is useful to any trader.
Gross’s commentary is humorous, enlightening, and educational, and I make
it a habit to read his outlook piece every month. But I should warn you: To
fully understand the high-level concepts that Gross presents, you may need
to do some additional reading. I view this as a good thing because it pushes
you to raise your swing trading game.
You can access Gross’s commentary by visiting PIMCO’s Web site and view-
ing the “Featured Market Commentary.” You can even sign up for e-mail alerts
when Gross’s commentary is published — all for free. See www.pimco.com.
Barron’s weekly financial newspaper
Barron’s is a weekly financial newspaper that covers equities, bonds, com-
modities, mutual funds, and so on. I subscribe to the newspaper and review
it on the weekends to keep up to speed on the major events that happened
in the past week or that may be happening in the coming week. Why do I
choose a weekly paper over a daily one, such as The Wall Street Journal? Well,
plenty of random market events occur on a daily basis. But much of it is just
noise — immaterial news used to fill pages more than to convey anything of
substance — and it can cause you to lose your focus.
Weekly newspapers are less susceptible to that problem (but still suscep-
tible, nonetheless). Although swing traders don’t need a play-by-play of the
financial markets to profit, an ESPN summary of the game is helpful.
Generally, I don’t rely on Barron’s for trading ideas. Your primary sources for such
ideas should be HGS Investor and Investor’s Business Daily, both of which I highlight
earlier in this appendix, as well as other financial Web sites. But Barron’s is a valu-
able educational tool. I always review “Up & Down on Wall Street” to get a humor-
ous and satirical take on the markets and the “Commodities Corner” to review
events taking place in major commodities. Other noteworthy columns include the
“International Trader” and “Charting the Market.”
To subscribe to Barron’s, visit www.barrons.com. As of this writing, a year’s
subscription costs $99 for the print edition or $149 for the print and online
editions.

Keeping Tabs on Your Portfolio
and the Latest Market News
When you hold a portfolio of swing trading positions, you’re going to want
to stay on top of them like a hawk. But how can you do that, aside from
watching their prices change during the day? Monitoring your portfolio on a
day-to-day basis can be cumbersome, especially as you hold more and more
securities. Although setting alerts on your securities by using technical trad-
ing software (such as TradeStation, which I cover earlier in this appendix)
is important, you should also keep tabs on any fundamental news develop-
ments that occur.
Yahoo! Finance portfolio tool
The easiest way I’ve found to keep tabs on all the news on my positions is to
use the portfolio tool from Yahoo! Finance. This tool allows you to quickly
enter the symbols of your portfolio holdings. After the symbols are loaded, the
tool pulls down any news headlines associated with those symbols, sorted by
date, from such sources as Barron’s magazine, TheStreet.com, and company
press releases circulated by Reuters and the Associated Press. By checking
this Web site on a daily basis, you can stay on top of company announcements
(such as earnings dates) or positive/negative mentions of your securities in the
popular press. I can quickly stay on top of a portfolio of 25 positions by using
this portfolio monitoring service. And the best part is, it’s free.
To see the portfolio tool, visit Yahoo! Finance at finance.yahoo.com. Then
click on the tab labeled “My Portfolio.” You may need to sign onto Yahoo! or
create a Yahoo! ID to uniquely identify you and your holdings. After you’ve
logged onto Yahoo!, you can edit or create portfolios on Yahoo! Finance.
Yahoo! Economic Calendar
On almost every business day, the federal government or private organiza-
tions release economic news that affects financial markets. Some of the
information is very important (such as Federal Reserve Bank interest rate
decisions), whereas other data points have little impact.
To keep yourself apprised of the important stuff, turn to Yahoo! Economic
Calendar, which provides a listing of all major economic news scheduled
to be released in any given week. The Web site shows what data is to be
2244__229933668833--bbaapppp0011..iinndddd 330055 77//2288//0088 77::0088::2233 PPMM

released, how important the data is, and what the market expects the data to
be. Some data is released before the market opens, and other data is released
during market hours. I check the site at least once a week to know what
major news items I can expect.
Most news items on Yahoo! Economic Calendar are defined and rated a grade
that indicates their level of importance. Items with low grades, like C or D,
aren’t critical to your trading game. The only time those reports move mar-
kets is when the numbers come in way too high or way too low. Keep your
watchful eye on reports graded A or B.
But how do you know when a report helps or hurts stocks? Follow these
guidelines:
(cid:2) Inflation: Generally, higher-than-expected inflationary data (in the form
of the Consumer Price Index or the Producer Price Index) is negative for
both stocks and bonds.
(cid:2) Economic data: The growth rate in the country’s gross domestic prod-
uct may be interpreted as bearish or bullish for stocks, depending on
the stage of the economic cycle. If the economy is weak, then strong
economic growth numbers are highly prized. However, if the economy is
overheating, a strong economic report may send stock prices falling fast.
(cid:2) Central Bank Actions: These actions (for example, lowering or raising
short-term interest rates) tend to have the largest effects on financial
markets. When the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates by more than
market expectations, it generally leads to rallies in stocks and bonds.
When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by more than market
expectations, it generally leads to declines in stocks and bonds.
If these financial terms make you woozy, don’t worry. You don’t need to become
an economist to swing trade successfully. I just want you to be on top of the
reasons behind market movements so you can position yourself accordingly.
You can access the Yahoo! Economic Calendar page at biz.yahoo.com/
c/e.html.
Fine-Tuning Your Trading Techniques
In order to improve your swing trading methods, use your spare time to stay
up to speed on the latest research concerning trading techniques, indicators,
and other facets of your trading plan. I recommend a couple resources that
will help make you a better trader — a monthly magazine to assist in refining
your system and a book to help get you in the right trading state of mind.

Technical Analysis of Stocks
& Commodities magazine
Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities is a magazine devoted to analyzing
stocks and commodities from a technical perspective. The magazine is released
monthly and covers charting, computer trading methods, and technical software
products. The magazine also features interviews with trading professionals
discussing their approach to the markets.
The magazine isn’t a resource for trading ideas. Rather, it helps traders improve
their trading techniques by applying existing indicators or by using new ones.
When computer code is necessary to implement an indicator that the maga-
zine discusses, the formula or code is usually included. And I like the fact that
figures are interspersed with the text to make concepts easy to understand.
You shouldn’t implement every strategy or indicator you read about in this
magazine. Rather, look to refine your own systems by incorporating nuggets
of information that arise from time to time. Your trading system shouldn’t
change on a day-to-day basis (or month to month, for that matter). But the
techniques you use can be refined if such honing improves performance.
To subscribe to or find out more about this magazine, visit www.traders.
com or call 800-832-4642.
The Black Swan: The Impact
of the Highly Improbable
True knowledge is understanding one’s ignorance. Financial markets teach
that lesson to thousands every day.
Nassim Taleb’s book, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,
colorfully educates readers on the risks of thinking they know more than they
really do. The book’s title comes from the problem of induction, or drawing
generalities based on particular events. For example, a scientist in Europe who
witnesses thousands and thousands of white swans may come to the conclu-
sion that “All swans are white.” However, just because the scientist never wit-
nesses a black swan doesn’t mean that black swans don’t exist. (Black swans
do in fact exist.) Similarly in trading, you can’t assume that certain events can’t
happen just because they’ve never happened before. And you can’t assume
that certain relationships must continue to exist in the future simply because
they’ve existed in the past.

Swing Trading For Dummies
Though Taleb’s book isn’t specifically geared to swing trading per se, I consider
it invaluable because it helps train traders to think differently than the masses
on Wall Street. The book is also helpful in terms of a risk management perspec-
tive. You’ll be better able to manage your risk if you plan for extreme events and
how they may affect your positions.
