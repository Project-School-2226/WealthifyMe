Preface
There are some amazing stories here:
A trader who, after wiping out several times early in his career, turned a $30,000 account into $80
million A fund manager who achieved what many thought impossible—five consecutive years of
triple-digit percentage returns A trader from small-town America who started out on a shoestring
and has become one of the world's largest bond traders A former securities analyst who, during the
past seven years, has realized an average monthly return of 25 percent (over 1,400 percent
armualized), primarily trading stock index futures An electrical engineering graduate from МГГ
whose largely computerized approach to trading has earned his accounts an astounding 250,000
percent return over a sixteen-year period.
These are but a sampling of the interviews contained in this book. In his own way, each of the
traders interviewed has achieved incredible success.
What sets these traders apart? Most people think that winning in the markets has something to do
with finding the secret formula. The truth is that any common denominator among the traders I
interviewed had more to do with attitude than approach. Some of the traders use fundamental
analysis exclusively, others employ only technical analysis, and still others combine the two. Some
traders operate on a time horizon measured in hours or even minutes, while others typically
implement positions that they intend to hold for months or even years. Although the trading
methodologies varied widely, the forthcoming interviews reveal certain important commonalities in
trading attitudes and principles.
Trading provides one of the last great frontiers of opportunity in our economy. It is one of the very
few ways in which an individual can start with a relatively small bankroll and actually become a
multimillionaire. Of course, only a handful of individuals (such as those interviewed here) succeed
in turning this feat, but at least the opportunity exists.
While I hardly expect all readers of this book to transform themselves into super-traders—the
world just doesn't work that way—I believe that these thought-provoking interviews will help most
serious and open-minded readers improve their personal trading performance. It may even help a
select few become super-traders.

Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I would like to thank Stephen Chronowitz, who pored over every chapter in this
book and provided a multitude of helpful suggestions and editing changes. I am indebted to Steve
for both the quantity (hours) and quality of his input. I truly believe that whatever the merits of this
work, it has benefited significantly from his contributions.
I am grateful to my wife, Jo Arm, not only for enduring nine months as a "book widow," but also
for being a valuable sounding board—a role she performed with brutal honesty. Sample: "This is
the worst thing you ever wrote!" (Needless to say, that item was excised from the book.) Jo Arm
possesses common sense in abundance, and I usually followed her advice unquestioningly.
Of course, I would like to express my thanks to all the traders who agreed to be interviewed,
without whom there would be no book. By and large, these traders neither need nor seek publicity,
as they trade only for their own accounts or are already managing all the money they wish to. In
many cases, their motives for participating were altruistic. For example, as one trader expressed it,
"When I was starting out, I found biographies and interviews of successful traders particularly
helpful, and I would like to play a similar role in helping new traders."
I wish to express my sincere appreciation to Elaine Crocker for her friendly persuasion, which
made some of the chapters in this book possible. For advice, leads, and other assorted favors, I
would like to thank Courtney Smith, Norm Zadeh, Susan Abbott, Bruce Babcock, Martin Presler,
Chuck Carlson, Leigh Stevens, Brian Gelber, Michael Marcus, and William Rafter. Finally, I
would like to thank three traders who were gracious enough to grant me lengthy interviews, which
were not incorporated into this book: Irv Kessler, Doug Redmond, and Martin Presler (the former
two because, in retrospect, I considered my line of questioning too esoteric and technical; the latter
because publication deadlines did not permit time for needed follow-up interviews and editing).

Prologue
The name of the book was The Big Board. . . . It was about an Earth-ling man and woman who
were kidnapped by extraterrestrials. They were put on display in a zoo on a planet called Zircon-
212.
These fictitious people in the zoo had a big board supposedly showing stock market quotations and
commodity prices along one wall of their habitat, and a news ticker, and a telephone that was
supposedly connected to a brokerage on Earth. The creatures on Zircon-212 told their captives that
they had invested a million dollars for them back on Earth, and that it was up to the captives to
manage it so that they would be fabulously wealthy when they were returned to Earth.
The telephone and the big board and the ticker were all fakes, of course. They were simply
stimulants to make the Earthlings perform vividly for the crowds at the zoo—to make them jump
up and down and cheer, or gloat, or sulk, or tear their hair, to be scared shitless or to feel as
contented as babies in their mothers' arms.
The Earthlings did very well on paper. That was part of the rigging, of course. And religion got
mixed up in it, too. The news ticker reminded them that the President of the United States had
declared National Prayer Week, and that everybody should pray. The Earthlings had had a bad
week on the market before that. They had lost a small fortune in olive oil futures. So they gave
praying a whirl. It worked. Olive oil went up.
—Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Slaughterhouse Five
If the random walk theorists are correct, then Earthbound traders are suffering from the same
delusions as the zoo inhabitants of Kilgore Trout's novel. (Kilgore Trout is the ubiquitous science
fiction writer in Kurt Vonnegut's novels.) Whereas the prisoners on Zircon-212 thought their
decisions were being based on actual price quotes—they were not—real-life traders believe they
can beat the market by their acumen or skill. If markets are truly efficient and random in every time
span, then these traders are attributing their success or failure to their own skills or shortcomings,
when in reality it is all a matter of luck.
After interviewing the traders for this book, it is hard to believe this view of the world. One comes
away with a strong belief that it is highly unlikely that some traders can win with such consistency
over vast numbers of trades and many years. Of course, given enough traders, some will come out
ahead even after a long period of time, simply as a consequence of the laws of probability. I leave it
for the mathematicians to determine the odds of traders winning by the magnitude and duration that
those interviewed here have. Incidentally, the traders themselves have not a glimmer of doubt that,
over the long run, the question of who wins and who loses is determined by skill, not luck. I, too,
share this conviction.

My Own Story
Right out of graduate school, I landed a job as a commodity research analyst. I was pleasantly
surprised to find that my economic and statistical analysis correctly predicted a number of major
commodity price moves. It was not long thereafter that the thought of trading came to mind. The
only problem was that my department generally did not permit analysts to trade. I discussed my
frustration over this situation with Michael Marcus (first interview), with whom I became friends
while interviewing for the research position he was vacating. Michael said, "You know, I had the
same problem when I worked there. You should do what I did—open an account at another firm."
He introduced me to a broker at his new firm, who was willing to open the account.
At the time, I was earning less than the department secretary, so I didn't exactly have much risk
capital. I had my brother open a $2,000 account for which I acted as an advisor. Since the account
had to be kept secret, I could not call in any orders from my desk. Every time I wanted to initiate or
liquidate a position, I had to take the elevator to the building's basement to use the public phone.
(Marcus' solution to the same problem is discussed in his interview.) The worst part of the situation
was not merely the delays in order entry, which were often nerve-wracking, but the fact that I had
to be very circumspect about the number of times I left my desk. Sometimes, I would decide to
delay an order until the following morning in order to avoid «rearing any suspicion.
I don't remember any specifics about my first few trades. All I recall is that, on balance, I did only a
little better than break even after paying commissions. Then came the first trade that made a lasting
impression. I had done a very detailed analysis of the cotton market throughout the entire post-
World War П period. I discovered that because of a variety of government support programs, only
two seasons since 1953 could truly be termed free markets [markets in which prices were
determined by supply and demand rather than the prevailing government program]. I correctly
concluded that only these two seasons could be used in forecasting prices. Unfortunately, I failed to
reach the more significant conclusion that existing data were insufficient to permit a meaningful
market analysis. Based on a comparison with these two seasons, I inferred that cotton prices, which
were then trading at 25 cents per pound, would move higher, but peak around 32-33 cents.
The initial part of the forecast proved correct as cotton prices edged higher over a period of months.
Then the advance accelerated and cotton jumped from 28 to 31 cents in a single week. This latest
rally was attributed to some news I considered rather unimportant. "Close enough to my projected
top," I thought, and I decided to go short. Thereafter, the market moved slightly higher and then
quickly broke back to the 29-cent level. This seemed perfectly natural to me, as I expected markets
to conform to my analysis. My profits and elation were short-lived, however, as cotton prices soon
rebounded to new highs and then moved unrelentingly higher: 32 cents, 33 cents, 34 cents, 35
cents. Finally, with my account equity wiped out, I was forced to liquidate the position. Not having
much money in those days may have been one of my luckiest breaks, since cotton eventually
soared to an incredible level of 99 cents—more than double the century's previous high price!
That trade knocked me out of the box for a while. Over the next few years, I again tried my hand at
trading a couple of times. In each instance, I started with not much more than $2,000 and
eventually wiped out because of a single large loss. My only consolation was that the amounts I lost
were relatively small.
Two things finally broke this pattern of failure. First, I met Steve Chronowitz. At the time, I was
the commodity research director at Hornblower & Weeks, and I hired Steve to fill a slot as the
department's precious metals analyst. Steve and I shared the same office, and we quickly became
good friends. In contrast to myself, a pure fundamental analyst, Steve' s approach to the markets
was strictly technical. (The fundamental analyst uses economic data to forecast prices, while the
technical analyst employs internal market data—such as price, volume, and sentiment—to project
prices.)
Until that time, I had viewed technical analysis with great skepticism. I tended to doubt that
anything as simple as chart reading could be of any value. Working closely with Steve, however, I
began to notice that his market calls were often right. Eventually, I became convinced that my
initial assessment of technical analysis was wrong. I realized that, at least for myself, fundamental
analysis alone was insufficient for successful trading; I also needed to incorporate technical
7

                      PAGE 8                      
==================================================

analysis for the timing of trades.
The second key element that finally put me into the winner's column was the realization that risk
control was absolutely essential to successful trading. I decided that I would never again allow
myself to lose everything on a single trade—no matter how convinced I was of my market view.
Ironically, the trade that I consider my turning point and one of my best trades ever was actually a
loss. At the time, the Deutsche mark had carved out a lengthy trading range following an extended
decline. Based on my market analysis, I believed that the Deutsche mark was forming an important
price base. I went long within the consolidation, simultaneously placing a good-till-cancelled stop
order just below the recent low. I reasoned that if I was right, the market should not fall to new
lows. Several days later, the market started falling and I was stopped out of my position at a small
loss. The great thing was that after I was stopped out, the market plummeted like a stone. In the
past, this type of trade would have wiped me out; instead, I suffered only a minor loss.
Not long thereafter, I became bullish on the Japanese yen, which had formed a technically bullish
consolidation, providing a meaningful close point to place a protective stop. While I normally
implemented only a one-contract position, the fact that I felt reasonably able to define my risk at
only 15 ticks per contract—today, I find it hard to believe that I was able to get away with that
close a stop—allowed me to put on a three-contract position. The market never looked back.
Although I ended up getting out of that position far too early, I held one of the contracts long
enough to triple my small account size. That was the start of my success at trading. Over the next
few years, the synthesis of technical and fundamental analysis combined with risk control allowed
me to build my small stake into well over $100,000.
Then the streak ended. I found myself trading more impulsively, failing to follow the rules I had
learned. In retrospect, I believe I had just become too cocky. In particular, I remember a losing
trade in soybeans. Instead of taking my loss when the market moved against me, I was so
convinced that the decline was a reaction in a bull market that I substantially increased my position.
The mistake was compounded by taking this action in front of an important government crop
report. The report came out bearish, and my equity took a dramatic decline. In a matter of days, I
had surrendered over one-quarter of my cumulative profits.
After cashing in my chips to buy a house and later taking a yearlong sabbatical to write a book,*
my savings were sufficiently depleted to defer my reentry into trading for nearly five years. When I
began trading again, typical to my usual custom, I started with a small amount: $8,000. Most of this
money was lost over the course of a year. I added another $8,000 to the account and, after some
further moderate setbacks, eventually scored a few big winning trades. Within about two years, I
had once again built my trading account up to over $100,000. I subsequently stalled out, and during
the past year, my account equity has fluctuated below this peak.
Although, objectively, my trading has been successful, on an emotional level, I often view it with a
sense of failure. Basically, I feel that given my market knowledge and experience, I should have
done better. "Why," I ask myself, "have I been able to multiply a sub-$ 10,000 account more than
tenfold on two occasions, yet unable to expand the equity much beyond that level, let alone by any
multiples?"
A desire to find the answers was one of my motivations for writing this book. I wanted to ask those
traders who had already succeeded: What are the key elements to your success? What approach do
you use in the markets? What trading rules do you adhere to? What were your own early trading
experiences? What advice would you give to other traders?
While, on one level, my search for answers was a personal quest to help surpass my own barriers,
in a broader sense, I saw myself as Everyman, asking the questions I thought others would ask if
given the opportunity.

Taking the Mystery Out of Futures
Of all the markets discussed in this book, the futures market is probably the one least understood by
most investors. It is also one of the fastest growing. Trading volume in futures has expanded more
than twentyfold during the past twenty years. In 1988, the dollar value of all futures contracts
traded in the U.S. exceeded $10 trillion!* Obviously, there is a lot more than pork belly trading
involved here.
Today's futures markets encompass all of the world's major market groups: interest rates (e.g., T-
bonds), stock indexes (e.g., the S&P 500), currencies (e.g., Japanese yen), precious metals (e.g.,
gold), energy (e.g., crude oil), and agricultural commodities (e.g., corn). Although the futures
markets had their origins in agricultural commodities, this sector now accounts for only about one-
fifth of total futures trading. During the past decade, the introduction and spectacular growth of
many new contracts has resulted in the financial-type markets (currencies, interest rate instruments,
and stock indexes) accounting for approximately 60 percent
*This is a rough but conservative estimate based on 246 million contracts traded and assuming an
average contract value well over $40,000. (Excluding short-term interest rate futures, such as
Eurodollars, single contract values ranged from about $11,000 for sugar at Ю0ДЬ. to $150,000 for
the S&P 500 at an index value of 300.) of all futures trading. (Energy and metal markets account
for nearly half of the remaining 40 percent.) Thus, while the term commodities is often used to
refer to the futures markets, it has increasingly become a misnomer. Many of the most actively
traded futures markets, such as those in the financial instruments, are not truly commodities, while
many commodity markets have no corresponding futures markets.
The essence of a futures market is in its name: Trading involves a standardized contract for a
commodity, such as gold, or a financial instrument, such as T-bonds, for a future delivery date, as
opposed to the present time. For example, if an automobile manufacturer needs copper for current
operations, it will buy its materials directly from a producer. If, however, the same manufacturer
was concerned that copper prices would be much higher in six months, it could approximately lock
in its costs at that time by buying copper futures now. (This offset of future price risk is called a
hedge.) If copper prices climbed during the interim, the profit on the futures hedge would
approximately offset the higher cost of copper at the time of actual purchase. Of course, if copper
prices declined instead, the futures hedge would result in a loss, but the manufacturer would end up
buying its copper at lower levels than it was willing to lock in.
While hedgers, such as the above automobile manufacturer, participate in futures markets to reduce
the risk of an adverse price move, traders participate in an effort to profit from anticipated price
changes. In fact, many traders will prefer the futures markets over their cash counterparts as trading
vehicles for a variety of reasons:
1. Standardized contracts—Futures contracts are standardized (in terms of quantity and quality);
thus, the trader does not have to find a specific buyer or seller in order to initiate or liquidate a
position.
2. Liquidity —All of the major futures markets provide excellent liquidity.
3. Ease of going short—The futures markets allow equal ease of going short as well as long. For
example, the short seller in the stock market (who is actually borrowing stock to sell) must wait for
an uptick, before initiating a position; no such restriction exists in the futures markets.
4. Leverage—The futures markets offer tremendous leverage. Roughly speaking, initial margin
requirements are usually equal to 5 to 10 per cent of the contract value. (The use of the term margin
in the futures market is unfortunate because it leads to tremendous confusion with the concept of
margins in stocks. In the futures markets, margins do not imply partial payments, since no actual
physical transaction occurs until the expiration date; rather, margins are basically good-faith
deposits.) Although high leverage is one of the attributes of futures markets for traders, it should be
emphasized that leverage is a two-edged sword. The undisciplined use of leverage is the single
most important reason why most traders lose money in the futures markets. In general, futures
prices are no more volatile than the underlying cash prices or, for that matter, many stocks. The
high-risk reputation of futures is largely a consequence of the leverage factor.
5. Low transaction costs—Futures markets provide very low transaction costs. For example, it is
10



==================================================
                     PAGE 11                      
==================================================

far less expensive for a stock portfolio manager to reduce market exposure by selling the equivalent
dollar amount of stock index futures contracts than by selling individual stocks.
6. Ease of offset—A futures position can be offset at any time during market hours, providing
prices are not locked at limit-up or limitdown. (Some futures markets specify daily maximum price
changes. In cases in which free market forces would normally seek an equilibrium price outside the
range of boundaries implied by price limits, the market will simply move to the limit and virtually
cease to trade.)
7. Guaranteed by exchange—The futures trader does not have to be concerned about the financial
stability of the person on the other side of the trade. All futures transactions are guaranteed by the
clearinghouse of the exchange.
Since by their very structure, futures are closely tied to their underlying markets (the activity of
arbitrageurs assures that deviations are relatively minor and short lived), price moves in futures will
very closely parallel those in the corresponding cash markets. Keeping in mind that the majority of
futures trading activity is concentrated in financial instruments, many futures traders are, in reality,
traders in stocks, bonds, and currencies. In this context, the comments of futures traders
interviewed in the following chapters have direct relevance even to investors who have never
ventured beyond stocks and bonds.
The Interbank Currency Market Defined
The interbank currency market is a twenty-four-hour market which literally follows the sun around
the world, moving from banking centers in the U.S. to Australia, to the Far East, to Europe, and
finally back to the U.S. The market exists to fill the need of companies to hedge exchange risk in a
world of rapidly fluctuating currency values. For example, if a Japanese electronics manufacturer
negotiates an export sale of stereo equipment to the U.S. with payment in dollars to be received six
months hence, that manufacturer is vulnerable to a depreciation of the dollar versus the yen during
the interim. If the manufacturer wants to assure a fixed price in the local currency (yen) in order to
lock in a profit, he can hedge himself by selling the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars in the
interbank market for the anticipated date of payment. The banks will quote the manufacturer an
exchange rate for the precise amount required, for the specific future date.
Speculators trade in the interbank currency market in an effort to profit from their expectations
regarding shifts in exchange rates. For example, a speculator who anticipated a decline in the
British pound against the dollar would simply sell forward British pounds. (All transactions in the
interbank market are denominated in U.S. dollars.) A speculator who expected the British pound to
decline versus the Japanese yen would buy a specific dollar amount of Japanese yen and sell an
equivalent dollar amount of British pounds.

Michael Marcus - Blighting Never Strikes Twice
Michael Marcus began his career as a commodity research analyst for a major brokerage house. His
near-compulsive attraction to trading led him to abandon his salaried position to pursue full-time
trading. After a brief, almost comical, stint as a floor trader, he went to work for Commodities
Corporation, a firm that hired professional traders to trade the company's own funds. Marcus
became one of their most successful traders. In a number of years, his profits exceeded the
combined total profit of all the other traders. Over a ten-year period, he multiplied his company
account by an incredible 2,500-fold!
I first met Marcus the day I joined Reynolds Securities as a futures research analyst. Marcus had
accepted a similar job at a competing firm, and I was assuming the position he had just vacated. In
those early years in both our careers, we met regularly. Although I usually found my own analysis
more persuasive when we disagreed, Marcus ultimately proved right about the direction of the
market. Eventually, Marcus accepted a job as a trader, became very successful, and moved out to
the West Coast.
When I first conceived the idea for this book, Marcus was high on my list of interview candidates.
Marcus' initial response to my request was agreeable, but not firm. Several weeks later, he declined,
as his desire to maintain anonymity dominated his natural inclination to participate Ь an endeavor
he found appealing. (Marcus knew and respected many of the other traders I was interviewing.) I
was very disappointed because Marcus is one of the finest traders I have been privileged to know.
Fortunately, some additional persuasion by a mutual friend helped change his mind.
When I met Marcus for this interview, it had been seven years since we had last seen each other.
The interview was conducted in Marcus' home, a two-house complex set on a cliff overlooking a
private beach in Southern California. You enter the complex through a massive gate ("amazing
gate" as described by an assistant who provided me with driving directions) that would probably
have a good chance of holding up through a panzer division attack.
On first greeting, Marcus seemed aloof, almost withdrawn. This quiet side of Marcus' personality
makes his description of his short-lived attempt to be a floor trader particularly striking. He became
animated, however, as soon as he began talking about his trading experiences. Our conversation
focused on his early "roller coaster" years, which he considered to be the most interesting of his
career.
How did you first get interested in trading futures?
I was something of a scholar. In 1969, I graduated from Johns Hopkins, Phi Beta Kappa, near the
top of my class. I had a Ph.D. fellowship in psychology at Clark University, and fully expected to
live the life of a professor. Through a mutual friend, I met this fellow named John, who claimed he
could double my money every two weeks, like clockwork. That sounded very appealing [he
laughs]. I don't think I even asked John how he could do it. It was such an attractive idea that I
didn't want to spoil things by finding out too many facts. I was afraid I would get cold feet.
Weren't you skeptical? Didn't he sound too much like a used car salesman?
No, I had never invested in anything, and I was very naive. I hired John, who was a junior at my
school, to be my commodity trading advisor at $30 a week. Occasionally, I threw in free potato
chips and soda. He had a theory that you could subsist on that diet.
That's all you paid him? Weren't there any profit incentives—extra potato chips if he did
well?
No.
How much money did you allot for trading?
About $1,000 that I had saved up.
Then what happened?
My first trip to a brokerage house was very, very exciting. I got dressed up, putting on my only suit,
and we went to the Reynolds Securities office in Baltimore. It was a big, posh office, suggesting a
lot of old money. There was mahogany all over the place and a hushed, reverential tone permeated
the office. It was all very impressive.

==================================================
                     PAGE 13                      
==================================================

The focal point was a big commodity board at the front of the office, the kind that clicked the old-
fashioned way. It was really exciting to hear the click, click, click. They had a gallery from which
the traders could watch the board, but it was so far away that we had to use binoculars to see the
prices. That was also very exciting, because it was just like watching a horse race.
My first realization that things might become a little scary was when a voice came over the
loudspeaker recommending the purchase of soybean meal. I looked at John, expecting to see an
expression of confidence and assurance on his face. Instead, he looked at me and asked, "Do you
think we should do it?" [he laughs]. It quickly dawned on me that John didn't know anything at all.
I remember soybean meal was trading quietly: 78.30,78.40,78.30, 78.40. We put the order in, and
as soon as we got the confirmation back, almost mystically, the prices started clicking down. As
soon as it knew that I was in, the market took that as a signal to start descending. I guess I had good
instincts even then, because I immediately said to John, "We're not doing too well, let's get out!"
We lost about $100 on that trade.
The next trade was in corn, and the same thing happened. John asked me whether we should do the
trade. I said, "Well all right, let's try com." The outcome was the same.
Did you know anything at all about what you were doing? Had you read anything about
commodities or trading?
No, nothing.
Did you even know the contract sizes?
No, we didn't.
Did you know how much it was costing you per tick?
Yes.
Apparently, that was about the only thing you knew.
Right. Our next trade, in wheat, didn't work either. After that, we went back to corn and that trade
worked out better, it took us three days to lose our money. We were measuring success by the
number of days it took us to lose.
Were you always getting out after about a $100 loss?
Yes, although one trade lost almost $200.1 was down to about $500 when John came up with an
idea that was "going to save the day." We would buy August pork bellies and sell February pork
bellies because the spread was wider than the carrying charges [the total cost of taking delivery in
August, storing, and redelivering in February]. He said we couldn't lose on that trade.
I vaguely understood the idea and agreed to the trade. That was the first time we decided to go out
to lunch. All the other times we had been too busy scrutinizing the board, but we thought this was a
"can't lose" trade, so it was safe to leave. By the time we came back, I was just about wiped out. I
remember this feeling of shock, dismay, and incredulity.
I will never forget the image of John—he was a very portly guy with thick, opaque glasses—going
up to the quote board, pounding and shaking his fist at it, and shouting, "Doesn't anyone want to
make a guaranteed profit!" Later on, I learned that August pork bellies were not deliverable against
the February contract. The logic of the trade was flawed in the first place.
Had John ever traded before?
No.
So where did he come up with this story about doubling your money every two weeks?
I don't know, but after that trade, I was wiped out. So I told John that, in light of what happened, I
thought I knew as much as he did—which was nothing—and that I was going to fire him. No more
potato chips; no more diet soda. I'll never forget his response. He told me, "You are making the
greatest mistake of your life!" I asked him what he was going to do. He said, "I am going to
Bermuda to wash dishes to make a trading stake. Then I am going to become a millionaire and
retire." The thing that amused me was that he didn't say, "I'm going to Bermuda and take a job to
make a trading stake." He was very specific; he was going to wash dishes to get his trading stake.
What eventually happened to John?

==================================================
                     PAGE 14                      
==================================================

To this day, I have no idea. For all I know, he might oe living in Bermuda as a millionaire because
he washed dishes.
After that, I managed to rustle up another $500 and placed a few silver trades. I wiped out that
stake as well. My first eight trades, five with John and three on my own, were all losers.
Did the thought ever enter your mind that maybe trading was not for you?
No. I had always done well at school, so I figured it was just a question of getting the knack of it.
My father, who died when I was fifteen, had left $3,000 in life insurance, which I decided to cash
in, despite my mother's objections.
But I knew I really needed to learn something before trading again. I read Chester Keltner's books
on wheat and soybeans, and I also subscribed to his market letter, which made trading
recommendations. I followed the first recommendation, which was to buy wheat, and it worked. I
think I made 4 cents per bushel [$200] on that trade. It was my first win and very exciting.
Then between letters, the market fell back to my original buying price, so I bought it again and
made another profit on my own. I felt I was beginning to develop a sense for trading. Even in the
beginning, I liked the feeling of doing things on my own. What happened next was just sheer luck.
I bought three contracts of December corn in the summer of 1970, based on a Keltner
recommendation. That was the summer that blight devastated the corn crop.
Was that your first big win?
Yes, that trade combined with buying some more com, wheat, and soybeans, partly on
recommendations in the letter, and partly on my own intuition. When that glorious summer was
over, I had accumulated $30,000, a princely sum to me, having come from a middle class family. I
thought it was the best thing in the world.
How did you decide when to take profits?
I took some on the way up and some when the markets started coming down. Overall, I cashed in
very well.
So instinctively, you were doing the right thing even then?
Yes. Then that fall I attended graduate school in Worcester, Massachusetts, but I found that I didn't
want to think about my thesis. Instead of going to class, I would often sneak down to the Paine
Webber office in Worcester to trade.
I was having a great time. I made a little money, not a lot. I was shocked to find myself cutting
classes frequently, since I had been a dedicated scholar at Johns Hopkins. I realized that the
handwriting was on the wall, and in December 19701 dropped out of school and moved to New
York. I stayed at the Y for a while. When people asked me what I did, I rather pompously told them
that I was a speculator. It had a nice ring to it.
In the spring of 1971, the grains started getting interesting again. There was a theory around that
the blight had wintered over—that is, it had survived the winter and was going to attack the corn
crop again. I decided I would be really positioned for the blight this time.
Was this Keltner's theory, or just a market rumor?
I think Keltner believed it too. I borrowed $20,000 from my mother, added it to my $30,000, and
bet everything on the blight. I bought the maximum number of corn and wheat contracts possible
for $50,000 in margin. Initially, the markets held steady because there was enough fear of the blight
to keep prices up. I wasn't making money, but I wasn't losing it either. Then one day—I will never
forget this—there was an article in the Wall Street Journal with the headline: "More Blight on the
Floor of the Chicago Board of Trade Than in Midwest Cornfields" [he laughs]. The corn market
opened sharply lower and fairly quickly went limit-down.
[hi many futures markets, the maximum daily price change is restricted by a specified limit. Limit-
down refers to a decline of this magnitude, while limit-up refers to an equivalent gain. If, as in this
case, the equilibrium price that would result from the interaction of free market forces lies below
the limit-down price, then the market will lock limit-down [i.e., trading will virtually cease.
Reason: there will be an abundance of sellers, but virtually no willing buyers at the restricted limit-
down price.]

==================================================
                     PAGE 15                      
==================================================

Were you watching the market collapse?
Yes, I was in the brokerage office, watching the board as prices fell.
Did you think of getting out on the way down before the market was locked limit-down?
I felt that I should get out, but I just watched. I was totally paralyzed. I was hoping the market
would turn around. I watched and watched and then after it locked limit-down, I couldn't get out. I
had all night to think about it, but I really had no choice. I didn't have any more money and had to
get out. The next morning, I liquidated my entire position on the opening.
Was the market sharply lower again on the opening?
No, not sharply, just about 2 cents.
How much did you lose on the trade by the time you liquidated?
I lost my own $30,000, plus $ 12,000 of the $20,000 my mother had lent me. That was my lesson in
betting my whole wad.
What did you do then?
I was really upset. I decided I had to go to work. Since there was a recession at the time, I thought I
probably couldn't get a really good job and should try to settle for a lesser position. I found that
even though I interviewed for positions for which I was unusually well qualified, I couldn't seem to
get any job. I finally realized that I couldn't get these jobs because I didn't really want them.
One of the best job openings I found was a commodity research analyst slot at Reynolds Securities.
I discovered that it was easier to get this better position because they could tell I really wanted it. I
learned that if you shoot for what you want, you stand a much better chance of getting it because
you care much more.
Anyway, there was a glass partition betweenmy office and the main office where the brokers sat. I
still had the trading bug and it was very painful to watch them trading and whooping it up.
While you were just doing the research?
Right, because the analysts were strictly forbidden to trade. But I decided I wouldn't let that stop
me. I borrowed from my mother again, my brother, and my girlfriend and opened an account at
another firm. I worked out an intricate code system with my broker to keep people in my office
from knowing that I was violating the rules. For example, if I said, "the sun was out," that meant
one thing, while if I said, "the weather is cloudy," it meant something else.
While I was trying to write my market reports, I kept peering out through the glass partition to see
the prices on the big trading board in the main office. When I was winning, I tried to hide my
elation, and when I was losing, I had to make sure not to let it show on my face. I don't think
anyone ever caught on, but I was in a manic-depressive state throughout that time. I felt tortured
because I wanted to be free to trade without going through this elaborate charade.
Were you making or losing money during this time?
I lost. It was the same old cycle of borrowing money and consistently losing it.
Did you know what you were doing wrong then?
Good question. Basically, I had no real grasp of trading principles; I was doing everything wrong.
Then in October 1971, while at my broker's office, I met one of the people to whom I attribute my
success.
Who was that?
Ed Seykota. He is a genius and a great trader who has been phenomenally successful. When I first
met Ed he had recently graduated from MIT and had developed one of the first computer programs
for testing and trading technical systems. I still don't know how Ed amassed so much knowledge
about trading at such an early age.
Ed told me, "I think you ought to work here. We are starting a research group and you can trade
your own account." It sounded great; the only problem was that the firm's research director refused
to hire me.
Why?
I couldn't imagine why since I wrote well and had experience. When I pressed him for a reason, he
15



==================================================
                     PAGE 16                      
==================================================

told me, "I can't hire you because you already know too much and I want to train somebody." I
said, "Look, I will do anything you want." Eventually, I convinced him to hire me.
It was really great, because I had Ed to learn from, and he was already a very successful trader. He
was basically a trend follower, who utilized classic trading principles. He taught me how to cut my
losses, as well as the importance of riding winners.
Ed provided an excellent role model. For example, one time, he was short silver and the market just
kept eking down, a half penny a day, a penny a day. Everyone else seemed to be bullish, talking
about why silver had to go up because it was so cheap, but Ed just stayed short. Ed said, "The trend
is down, and I'm going to stay short until the trend changes." I learned patience from him in the
way he followed the trend.
Did Ed's example turn you around as a trader?
Not initially. I continued to lose, even with Ed there.
Do you remember what you were still doing wrong at that time?
I think I wasn't patient enough to wait for a clearly defined situation.
Did you think of just tailcoating Ed, because he was so successful?
No, I couldn't bring myself to do that.
Did you ever think of just giving up on trading?
I would sometimes think that maybe I ought to stop trading because it was very painful to keep
losing. In "Fiddler on the Roof," there is a scene where the lead looks up and talks to God. I would
look up and say, "Am I really that stupid?" And I seemed to hear a clear answer saying, "No, you
are not stupid. You just have to keep at it." So I did.
At the time, I was befriended by a very kind, knowledgeable, and successful semiretired broker at
Shearson named Amos Hostetter. He liked my writing, and we used to talk. Amos reinforced a lot
of the things Ed taught me. I was getting the same principles from two people.
Were you making recommendations for the firm at the time?
Yes.
And how did the recommendations work out?
They were better because I was more patient. Anyway, I was totally out of money, and out of
people who would lend me money. But I still had a kind of stubborn confidence that I could
somehow get back on the right track again. I was only making $12,500 a year, but I managed to
save $700. Since that wasn't even enough to open an account, I opened a joint account with a friend
who also put up $700.
Were you totally directing the trading in this joint account?
Yes, my friend didn't know anything about the markets. This was in July 1972 and, at the time, we
were under price controls. The futures market was supposedly also under price controls.
This was Nixon's price freeze?
Yes. As I recall, the plywood price was theoretically frozen at $110 per 1,000 square feet. Plywood
was one of the markets I analyzed for the firm. The price had edged up close to $110, and I put out
a bearish newsletter saying even though supplies were tight, since prices couldn't go beyond $110,
there was nothing to lose by going short at $110.
How did the government keep prices at the set limits? What prevented supply and demand
from dictating a higher price?
It was against the law for prices to go higher.
You mean producers couldn't charge more for it?
Right. What was happening though was that the price was being kept artificially low, and there is
an economic principle that an artificially low price will create a shortage. So shortages developed in
plywood, but supposedly the futures market was also under this guideline. However, no one was
sure; it was sort of a gray area. One day, while I was looking at the quote board, the price hit $110.
Then it hit $110.10; then $110.20. In other words, the futures price was trading 20 cents over the
legal ceiling. So I started calling around to see what was going to happen, but nobody seemed to
16



==================================================
                     PAGE 17                      
==================================================

know.
Was plywood the only market exceeding its price freeze level?
Yes. Anyway, nothing happened. I think the market closed somewhere over $110 that day. The
next day it opened at about $110.80.1 used the following reasoning: If they let it trade over $110
today, they might let it trade anywhere. So I bought one contract. Well, ultimately, plywood went
to $200. After I bought that first contract, and prices rose, it was just a matter of pyramiding and
riding the position.
Was that your first really big trade after you had been wiped out in the corn market?
Yes.
Did the cash plywood market stay at $110?
The futures market functioned as a supply of last resort to users who couldn't get supplies
elsewhere.
Basically, it created a two-tiered market, a sort of legal black market?
Yes. Those who were frozen out because they didn't have any longstanding relationships with
producers could get their plywood at a higher price in the futures market. The producers were
fuming at the thought that they had to sell at the legal price ceiling.
Why didn't producers just sell futures and deliver against the contract as opposed to selling
in the cash market at the price control level?
The smarter ones were learning that, but it was the infancy of futures trading in plywood and most
producers weren't that sophisticated. Some producers probably weren't sure that it was legal to do
that. Even if they thought it was, their lawyers might have told them, "Maybe people can buy
plywood at any price in the futures market, but we better not sell and deliver above the legal
ceiling." There were a lot of questions.
Did the government ever try to interfere with the futures markets?
Well not exactly, but I will get back to that. In just a few months, $700 had grown into $12,000
trading plywood.
Was this the only trade you had on?
Yes. Then I got the bright idea that the same shortage situation was going to occur in lumber. I bet
everything on one trade just as I had on the corn/wheat trade, expecting that lumber would also go
through the ceiling price.
What was lumber doing at this time?
It did nothing. It just watched plywood go from $110 to $200. Since they were both wood products,
and lumber was also in short supply, I reasoned that lumber could go way up—and it should have.
However, after I bought lumber at around $130, the government finally woke up to what had
happened in plywood, and they were determined not to let the same thing happen in lumber.
The day after I went long, some government official came out with an announcement that they
were going to crack down on speculators in lumber who were trying to ran up the market like they
had ply wood. The lumber market crashed just on that statement. I was down to the point where I
was close to being wiped out again. There was a two-week period during which they kept issuing
these statements. The market stabilized at a level just above where I would have been wiped out. I
had just enough money left to hang on to my position.
The market was at $130 when you bought it. Where was it at this time?
About$117.
So even though the magnitude of this decline was much smaller than the price rise in
plywood, you lost almost as much money because you had a much larger position in lumber
than you had in plywood.
Right. During those two weeks, I was constantly on the verge of being wiped out. It was the worst
two weeks in my whole life. I went to the office each day just about ready to give up.
Giving up just to stop the pain, or so that you would at least have something left?
17



==================================================
                     PAGE 18                      
==================================================

Both. I was so upset that I couldn't stop my hands from shaking.
How close did you come to being wiped out again?
Well, my $12,000 had shrunk to under $4,000.
Did you say to yourself, "I can't believe I have done this again"?
Yes, and I never did it again. That was the last time I bet everything on one trade.
What eventually happened?
I managed to hold on, and the market finally turned around. There was a shortage, and the
government didn't seem to have the will to stop the futures market.
Was it insight or courage that gave you the willpower to hold on?
Desperation, mainly, although there was a support point on the charts that the market couldn't seem
to take out. So, I held on. At the end of that year, the $700, which I had ran up to over $ 12,000 and
back to under $4,000, was now worth $24,000. After that scary experience, I never really
overtraded again.
The next year, 1973, the government began lifting the price controls. Because the price controls had
created numerous artificial shortages, when they were lifted, there was a tremendous run-up in
many commodities. Just about everything went up. Prices doubled in many markets, and I was able
to take advantage of the tremendous leverage offered by low futures margins. The lessons I had
learned from Seykota about staying in markets with major trends really paid off. In 1973, my
account grew from $24,000 to $64,000.
At that time, we were seeing something completely new. I remember those markets. Even
after prices had gone up only 10 percent of their eventual advance, historically, it seemed like
a very large price move. What made you realize that prices could go so much further?
At the time, I was politically right wing and that fit with being an inflation-alarmist. The theory that
the evil government was constantly debasing the currency provided the perfect perspective for
trading the inflationary markets of the mid-1970s.
It was the right theory for the right time.
Right. The markets were so fertile for trading then that I could make plenty of mistakes and still do
well.
Trading strictly on the long side?
Yes. Everything was going up. Although I was doing very well, I did make one terrible mistake.
During the great soybean bull market, the one that went from $3.25 to nearly $12,1 impulsively
took my profits and got out of everything. I was trying to be fancy instead of staying with the trend.
Ed Seykota never would get out of anything unless the trend changed. So Ed was in, while I was
out, and I watched in agony as soybeans went limit-up for twelve consecutive days. I was real
competitive, and every day I would come into the office knowing he was in and I was out. I
dreaded going to work, because I knew soybeans would be bid limit again and I couldn't get in.
Was this experience of not being in a runaway market as aggravating as actually losing
money?
Yes, more so. It was so aggravating that one day I felt I couldn't take it anymore and I tried
tranquilizers to dull the mental anguish. When that didn't work, somebody said, "Why don't you
take something stronger, called thorazine?"
I remember taking this thorazine at home and then getting on the subway to go to work. The
subway doors started to close as I was getting on and I started to fall down. At first, I didn't connect
it with the thorazine. Anyway, I wandered back home and just fell through the doorway—it was
that strong. It knocked me out and I missed work that day. That was the low point in my trading
career.
You never threw in the towel and just went back into soybeans at some point?
No, I was afraid of losing.
Despite that mistake, you mentioned before that you built your account up to $64,000 by
year-end. What happened next?
18



==================================================
                     PAGE 19                      
==================================================

Around that time, I would occasionally have to go over to the Cotton Exchange. I would have an
adrenalin rush when I heard the traders yelling and screaming. It seemed like the most exciting
place in the world. But I learned that I needed to show $100,000 net worth to get in. Since I had
virtually no assets outside of my commodity account, I couldn't qualify. I continued to make money
in the markets, and after several months, I had surpassed the $100,000 mark. Around that same
time, Ed Seykota recommended that I go long coffee. So I did, but I put a close stop in under the
market just in case it went down. The market turned down and I was stopped out quickly. Ed,
however, because he was a major trend follower, had no stop in and ended up being locked in a
limit-down market for several days in succession.
Each day, Seykota was locked in a losing position while I was out of the market. That was the exact
opposite situation of the soybean trade, when he was in a winning trade and I was out. I couldn't
help it, but I felt a sense of joy. I asked myself, "What kind of a place is this that one's greatest joy
is to be found when somebody else is getting screwed?" That was the point I realized that what I
was doing was too competitive, and I decided to become a floor trader at the New York Cotton
Exchange
It sounds like the floor would have been even more competitive.
Well, maybe, but it wasn't.
Did you have any concern about being a floor trader—the fact that you were now reducing
your field of opportunity down to one market?
I was a little concerned about it. As it turned out, I should have been very worried. However, the
thought of trading in the ring was very exciting to me. The truth of the matter was that while I was
very good at picking trades, I was a total bust at the execution part. I was very shy, and I was too
timid to yell loud enough to make myself heard on the floor. I ended up slipping my orders to a
floor trader friend of mine, who handled them for me. That went on for a few months until I
realized what I was doing.
Were you still approaching the markets as a position trader even though you were on the
floor?
Yes, but it was just out of timidity.
So, I assume that many days you weren't even trading.
Right.
Was there any advantage to being on the floor?
No, not for me. But I did learn a lot from the experience, and I would recommend it to anybody
who wants to become a better trader. I used what I learned there for years.
What type of things did you learn?
You develop an almost subconscious sense of the market on the floor. You learn to gauge price
movement by the intensity of the voices in the ring. For example, when the market is active and
moving, and then gets quiet, that is often a sign that it is not going to go much further. Also,
sometimes when the ring is moderately loud and suddenly gets very loud, instead of being a sign
that the market is ready to blast off, as you might think, it actually indicates that the market is
running into a greater amount of opposing orders.
But how do you use that type of information once you are off the floor? You said that the
things you learned on the floor helped you later on.
I learned the importance of intraday chart points, such as earlier daily highs. At key intraday chart
points, I could take much larger positions than I could afford to hold, and if it didn't work
immediately, I would get out quickly. For example, at a critical intraday point, I would take a
twenty-contract position, instead of the three to five contracts I could afford to hold, using an
extremely close stop. The market either took off and ran, or I was out. Sometimes I would make
300,400 points or more, with only a 10-point risk. That was because, by being on the floor, I had
become familiar with how the market responded to those intraday points. My trading in those days
was a little bit like being a surfer. I was trying to hit the crest of the wave just at the right moment.
But if it didn't work, I just got out. I was getting a shot at making several hundred points and hardly
19



==================================================
                     PAGE 20                      
==================================================

risking anything. I later used that surfing technique as a desk trader. Although that approach
worked real well then, I don't think it would work as well in today's markets.
Is that because the markets have become choppier?
Right. In those days, if the market reached an intraday chart point, it might penetrate that point,
take off, and never look back. Now it often comes back.
So what is the answer?
I think the secret is cutting down the number of trades you make. The best trades are the ones in
which you have all three things going for you: fundamentals, technicals, and market tone. First, the
fundamentals should suggest that there is an imbalance of supply and demand, which could result
in a major move. Second, the chart must show that the market is moving in the direction that the
fundamentals suggest. Third, when news comes out, the market should act in a way that reflects the
right psychological tone. For example, a bull market should shrug off bearish news and respond
vigorously to bullish news. If you can restrict your activity to only those types of trades, you have
to make money, in any market, under any circumstances.
Is that more restrictive trading style the approach you eventually adopted?
No, because basically I enjoyed the game too much. I knew that I should only be in those optimum
trades, but trading was a release and hobby for me. It replaced a lot of other things in my life. I
placed the fun of the action ahead of my own criteria. However, the thing that saved me was that
when a trade met all my criteria, I would enter five to six times the position size I was doing on the
other trades.
Were all your profits coming from the trades that met the criteria?
Yes.
Were the other trades breaking even?
The other trades broke even and kept me amused.
Did you keep track of which were which so you knew what was going on?
Just mentally. My goal on the other trades was just to break even. I knew that the big money was
going to be made on the trades that met my criteria. There will always be trades that meet those
requirements, but there may be fewer of them, so you have to be much more patient.
Why are there fewer such trades? Has the marketplace gotten more sophisticated?
Yes. There are many more professional traders than in my early days. In those years, I had an edge
just by knowing the angles that Ed Seykota and Amos Hosteller laught me. Now everybody knows
those principles. You have trading rooms filled with bright people and computers.
In those days, you watched the board, and you would buy corn when it moved above a key chart
point An hour later the grain elevator operator would gel a call from his broker and he mighl buy.
The nexl day, Ihe brokerage house would recommend the trade, pushing the market up some more.
On the third day, we would get short covering from the people that were wrong, and then some
fresh buying from the dentists of the world, who finally got the word that il was the right time lo
buy. Al that lime, I was one of the first ones lo buy because I was one of the few professional
traders playing the game. I would wind up selling out lo the dentists several days later.
You're talking about short-term trades. Weren't you trading for the major moves?
I traded some major moves, but many times I would make my profits in two or three days in jusl
that kind of trade.
When did you get back in the market?
Well, the dentisls weren'l going to keep their positions, since they were buying at the wrong time.
So when the market would fall back, I would go back in. Nowadays, the moment the market breaks
a key chart point, it is perceived by a whole universe of traders.
So the lagged follow-up trades are no longer there?
Right, the grain elevator operator has already bet. The dentists don't count because their level of
trading participation is infinitesimal.

==================================================
                     PAGE 21                      
==================================================

Is that because they now have their money invested with fund managers instead of trading by
themselves?
Right, and even if the dentists are still there, they are trading one-lots, which is a meaningless
position when the fund managers are trading a thousand at a clip. Now you almost have to be
contrary. You have to ask, "Isn't it true that all my fellow professional traders are already in, so who
is left to buy?" You didn't have to worry about that before, because there was always somebody left
to buy—the people who were getting the information or reacting slower. Now, everybody is just as
decisive, just as fast.
Are the markets more prone to false breakouts now?
Yes, much more.
Are trend-following systems then doomed to mediocrity?
I believe so. I believe that the era of trend following is over until and unless there is a particular
imbalance in a market that overrides everything else. [The 1988 drought in the grain belt, which
developed shortly after this interview, provides aperfect example of the type of exception Marcus is
describing.] Another exception would be if we were to enter a major inflationary or deflationary
environment.
In other words, unless there is some very powerful force that can overwhelm everything else.
Yes.
Have the markets changed during the past five to ten years because professional money
managers now account for a much greater proportion of speculative trading activity, as
opposed to the small speculators who tend to make all the mistakes?
The markets have changed. The proof is that Richard Dennis, who has done well for many years,
lost over 50 percent on the funds he was managing in 1988. The trend-following systems approach
doesn't work anymore. The problem is that once you have defined a trend and taken a position,
everyone else has taken a position as well. Since there is no one left to buy, the market swings
around in the other direction and gets you out.
One reason we don't have many good trends anymore is that the central banks are preventing
currency moves from getting out of hand by taking the other side of the trend.
Haven't they always done that?
I don't think so. If you look at a chart of treasury debt held by foreign central banks, you will see
that it has risen astronomically during the last few years. The foreign banks seem to be taking over
from private foreign investors in financing our trade debts.
What do you think that means in terms of trading, and has your own trading style changed
because of it?
At one time, I traded heavily in currencies. For example, in the years after Reagan was first elected
and the dollar was very strong, I would take positions as large as 600 million Deutsche marks
between my own account and the company account. At the time, that was about $300 million
worth. That was a pretty good line. I was probably one of the bigger currency traders in the world,
including the banks.
It was very exhausting because it was a twenty-four-hour market. When I went to sleep, I would
have to wake up almost every two hours to check the markets. I would tune in every major center
as it opened: Australia, Hong Kong, Zurich, and London. It killed my marriage. Nowadays, I try to
avoid the currencies, because I feel it is a totally political situation; you have to determine what the
central banks are going to do.
When you were trading the currencies actively, were you getting up through the night
because you were worried about getting caught on the wrong side of a major move before the
markets opened in the U.S.?
Yes.
Did you always trade that way, or did you get caught enough times so that you started
21



==================================================
                     PAGE 22                      
==================================================

trading around the clock?
It happened enough times to make me leery.
There would be a big gap move that you could have avoided by trading overseas?
That is right. For example, I remember one time, during late 1978, the dollar was getting battered,
falling to new lows every day. This was during a period when I was cooperating and trading as a
colleague with Brace Kovner. We used to talk hours every day. One day, we noticed that the dollar
got mysteriously strong. There was an intense price movement that couldn't be explained by any
known information. We just bailed out of our long currency positions like crazy. That weekend,
President Carter announced a dollar support program. If we had waited until the next U.S. trading
session, we would have been annihilated.
That situation illustrates one of the principles we believed in— namely, that the big players,
including the governments, would always tip their hand. If we saw a surprise price move against us
that we didn't understand, we often got out and looked for the reason later.
I remember that market well. The currency futures markets were locked limit-down for
several days in a row after that announcement. You must have gotten out right near the top
of that market.
We made a great exit on that trade. Anyway, my point is that I believe, as a courtesy, the European
central banks are notified about major changes we are going to make, and they often act ahead of
U.S. policy announcements. Consequently, the price move shows up in Europe first, even if it is
because of something we initiate. If it's an action initiated by the Europeans, the price move is
certainly going to occur there first. I think the best hours to trade are often in Europe. If I had a
period in which I was going to devote my life to trading, I would want to live in Europe.
Let's go back and fill in some of your trading history. Where did you go after you decided to
give up on being a floor trader?
I got a call from Amos Hostetter, who had befriended me at Shearson. At the time, he was also
trading some money for Commodities Corporation. Amos told me that I would be well advised to
consider joining Commodities Corporation as a trader.
At the time, their theory was that they were going to hire all these great econometricians to be
traders. They had people like Paul Samuel-son on the board. They brought up the idea of hiring me
at a meeting. The first question was, "What articles has he written; in what journals has he been
published?" I had a B. A. in liberal arts and that was it. The punch line was, "He just trades."
Everybody thought that was very funny.
But weren't they in business to make money trading?
They didn't think it was possible to really make money unless you had a Ph.D. But Amos
convinced them to give me a chance. I believe I was the first non-Ph.D. trader they had ever hired.
They started me out with $30,000 in August 1974. After about ten years, I had turned that account
into $80 million. Those were some very good years.
Did you multiply the original $30,000 into $80 million, or did they add money along the way?
After the first few years, they gave me another $100,000 to trade. After that time, they were always
taking money out. In those years, they were in an expansionary phase, and they taxed the traders 30
percent a year to pay for their expenses.
So you had to make 30 percent a year to keep your account level. You must have had some
incredible return years, given the growth of your account—particularly under that handicap.
I was making at least 100 percent a year for years and years.
What was your best year?
My best year must have been 1979. It was an incredible year. I caught gold when it went up to over
$800.
You caught the whole move?
I was in and out, but I remember catching big chunks of it—$100 per ounce at a time. It was a wild
time. In those days, I would buy gold in Australia, Hong Kong would push it up $10 higher, it
22



==================================================
                     PAGE 23                      
==================================================

would go up another $10 in London, and by the time New York opened, I was able to sell out at a
$30 profit.
It sounds like there was an enormous advantage to buying gold in the overseas markets
rather than in the United States.
In those days, I had an advantage by being in California, because I was up trading in Hong Kong
when my New York colleagues were asleep. I remember when I heard about the invasion of
Afghanistan on the television news. I called Hong Kong to see if anybody knew about it, and
nobody seemed to; the price wasn't changing. I was able to buy 200,000 ounces of gold before
anybody knew what was happening.
That's 2,000 contracts! Did you have any liquidity problems with their taking on that size
position in Hong Kong?
No, they gave me the stuff, but of course, they got fried by doing it. I was told on my last visit to
Hong Kong that I shouldn't visit the gold floor. Some of the people still remember that episode.
They knew who was on the other side of the trade?
Yes, they knew.
Did they think that you knew something?
No, they probably thought I was just crazy, coming in and buying all that gold. Then, when the
news broke about five to ten minutes later, everybody started scrambling. I had an immediate $10
per ounce profit on 200,000 ounces.
It's hard to believe you could trade off the television news.
I know. I had never done it before. That was the first, last, and only time, but I did do it.
That particular gold market ended in a near-vertical rise and fall. Did you get out in time?
Yes, I got out around $750 on the way up. I felt sick, when I saw gold go up to nearly $900. But
later when it was back down to $400,1 felt much better about it.
All in all, you got out very well. What tipped you off that we were near a top?
At that time, we had many wild markets. One of my rales was to get out when the volatility and the
momentum became absolutely insane. One way I had of measuring that was with limit days. In
those days, we used to have a lot of situations when a market would go limit-up for a number of
consecutive days. On the third straight limit-up day, I would begin to be very, very cautious. I
would almost always get out on the fourth limit-up day. And, if I had somehow survived with any
part of my position that long, I had a mandatory rale to get out on the fifth limit-up day. I just
forced myself out of the market on that kind of volatility.
Your transition from being a losing trader to being very successful coincided with the big bull
phase in the commodity markets during the early to mid-1970s. How much of your early
success was due to your skills as a trader and how much was just the markets?
Honestly, I think the markets were so good, that by buying and holding you just couldn't lose.
There were a lot of other success stories. Fortunes were being made.
But a lot of those people didn't keep their fortunes.
That's true. But, I was very fortunate. By the time the markets got difficult again, I was a good
trader. By then, I had really learned my craft. Also, by that time, I had the advantage of having
become very knowledgeable in one market: cocoa. For almost two years, I traded almost nothing
but cocoa, because of the information and help I got from Helmut Weymar [the founder of
Commodities Corporation]. Helmut was an incredible expert on cocoa. He wrote a book that was so
deep I couldn't understand the cover. Also, he had all kinds of friends in the business. With the
knowledge and information I got from Helmut and his friends, I felt that I knew the universe of
cocoa in a way that I had never known any market before.
That phase of almost exclusive cocoa trading obviously came to an end. What happened?
Helmut retired from cocoa trading.
I assume Helmut was not nearly as successful a trader as you were.
23



==================================================
                     PAGE 24                      
==================================================

Let's just say that I traded much better on Helmut's information than he did.
Excluding the early losing years, were there any trades that stand out as being particularly
traumatic?
Well, I would never let myself get caught up in potentially intimidating disasters. The worst
situation occurred during my heavy currency trading period. I was doing well and could afford to
hold large positions. One time, I had a really large position in Deutsche marks when the Bun-
desbank came in and decided to punish the speculators. I called in just around the time that all this
was happening and found out that I was out $2k million in about five minutes. So I got out, rather
than see the $2k million loss go to $10 million. Then I had to endure the disturbing experience of
watching the market recover its entire fall.
How long after you got out?
About half an hour.
Did you go back in?
No, they had taken the starch out of me by that point.
In retrospect, do you feel you did the right thing by getting out of that trade?
Yes, but it still hurt to realize that if I had sat it out and done nothing, I would have been OK
instead of losing $2 million.
Did you invest any of the money you were making in your trading, or did you keep plowing it
back into your own account?
I made a number of bad investments and lost a fairly large chunk of the money I had made trading.
When I was trading big, I wanted to have a reason to keep doing it, so I just spent money wildly. At
one time, I owned about ten houses and ended up losing money on all of them. Some I sold before I
had even spent a single night in them. I had a plane charter service and lost a lot of money on that.
At one point, I figured out that for every dollar I made trading, 30 percent was going to the
government, 30 percent was going to support my planes, and 20 percent was going to support my
real estate. So I finally decided to sell everything.
It sounds like as wise as you were as a trader, you were naive as an investor.
Yes, I was incredibly naive. Out of a fairly large number of real estate transactions—many in
California—I lost money on all but one of them. I am probably the only person alive that can claim
that dubious distinction.
Why do you think you did so poorly on your investments?
I would do everything emotionally. I didn't analyze anything.
In a sense, you were repeating the mistake of your early trading experience: getting involved
in something you knew nothing about and then losing money. Didn't any bells go off ? It
almost sounds like you had a self-destructive instinct in losing your money elsewhere.
Yes, absolutely. I probably lost more than half the money I made.
During this period when you were doing all these unwise things, didn't anybody try to grab
you by the shoulders and say, "Do you realize what you're doing?"
Yes, but any time someone on my staff did, I would fire them. At one time, I was employing sixty
or seventy people, hi addition to all my money-losing businesses, I had a huge nut to make to just
support the payroll. Frankly, a lot of the money I made just went down the drain.
Did these losses have any of the emotional impact of losses in the market? The reason I ask is
that you seem to talk about these investment losses very dispassionately.
Yes, it hurt to realize what a fool I had been, but I have learned not to be as attached to material
things. I accepted it as a life lesson. I learned I don't have to own a house in every beautiful place in
the world; I can stay at a hotel and walk on the beach or climb a trail there. Or, if I really feel like
spoiling myself, I can charter a plane; I don't have to own one.
Right, that certainly makes sense, but what I am getting at is that I suspect that if you had
lost the same amount of money trading, it would have been a much more traumatic
24



==================================================
                     PAGE 25                      
==================================================

experience. Is that because your ego wasn't attached to these other ventures?
Yes, I'm sure that's true. I always felt that, at least, I was smart at one thing. I feel like trading is the
only thing I am really good at. If not for that, I probably would have wound up shining shoes.
Do you think being a great trader is an innate skill?
I think to be in the upper echelon of successful traders requires an innate skill, a gift. It's just like
being a great violinist. But to be a competent trader and make money is a skill you can learn.
Having been through the whole trading experience from failure to extreme success, what
basic advice could you give a beginning trader or a losing trader?
The first thing I would say is always bet less than 5 percent of your money on any one idea. That
way you can be wrong more than twenty times; it will take you a long time to lose your money. I
would emphasize that the 5 percent applies to one idea. If you take a long position in two different
related grain markets, that is still one idea.
The next thing I would advise is to always use stops. I mean actually put them in, because that
commits you to get out at a certain point.
Do you always pick a point where you will get out before you get in?
Yes, I have always done that. You have to.
I would imagine in your case you can't actually put a stop in because your orders are too
large.
Yes, but my broker can hold it.
When you place an order to get into a position, is it accompanied by an order to get out?
That's right. Another thing is that if a position doesn't feel right as soon as you put it on, don't be
embarrassed to change your mind and get right out.
So, if you put the trade on and five minutes later it doesn't feel right, don't think to yourself,
"If I get out this quickly, my broker will think that I'm an idiot."
Yes, exactly. If you become unsure about a position, and you don't know what to do, just get out.
You can always come back in. When in doubt, get out and get a good night's sleep. I've done that
lots of times and the next day everything was clear.
Do you sometimes go back in right after you get out?
Yes, often the next day. While you are in, you can't think. When you get out, then you can think
clearly again.
What other advice would you give the novice trader?
Perhaps the most important rule is to hold on to your winners and cut your losers. Both are equally
important. If you don't stay with your winners, you are not going to be able to pay for the losers.
You also have to follow your own light. Because I have so many friends who are talented traders, I
often have to remind myself that if I try to trade their way, or on their ideas, I am going to lose.
Every trader has strengths and weaknesses. Some are good holders of winners, but may hold their
losers a little too long. Others may cut their winners a little short, but are quick to take their losses.
As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach. When you
try to incorporate someone else's style, you often wind up with the worst of both styles. I've done
that a lot.
Is it a problem because you don't have the same type of confidence in a trade that isn't yours?
Exactly, hi the final analysis, you need to have the courage to hold the position and take the risk. If
it comes down to "I'm in this trade because Brace is in it," then you are not going to have the
courage to stick with it. So you might as well not be in it in the first place.
Do you still talk to other traders about markets?
Not too much. Over the years, it has mostly cost me money. When I talk to other traders, I try to
keep very conscious of the idea that I have to listen to myself. I try to take their information without
getting overly influenced by their opinion.
I assume that we are talking about very talented traders, and it still doesn't make a
25



==================================================
                     PAGE 26                      
==================================================

difference. If it is not your own idea, it messes up your trading?
Right. You need to be aware that the world is very sophisticated and always ask yourself: "How
many people are left to act on this particular idea?" You have to consider whether the market has
already discounted your idea.
How can you possibly evaluate that?
By using the classic momentum-type indicators and observing market tone. How many days has the
market been down or up in a row? What is the reading on the sentiment indexes?
Can you think of any good examples of market tone tipping you off on a trade?
The most classic illustration I can think of is one of the soybean bull markets in the late 1970s. At
the time, soybeans were in extreme shortage. One of the things pushing the market up was the
weekly government reports indicating strong export commitments and sales. I was holding a heavy
long position in soybeans and someone from Commodities Corporation called me with the latest
export figures. He said, "I have good news and I have bad news." I said, "OK, what is the good
news?" "The good news is that the export commitment figure was fantastic. The bad news is that
you don't have a limit position [the maximum permissible speculative position size]." They were
expecting the market to be limit-up for the next three days.
Actually, I wound up being a little depressed that I didn't have a larger position. The next morning,
I entered an order to buy some more contracts on the opening, just in case I got lucky and the
market traded before locking limit-up. I sat back to watch the fun. The market opened limit-up as
expected. Shortly after the opening, I noticed a lot of ticks being recorded, as if the market was
trading at the limit-up. Then prices eased off limit-up just as my broker called to report my fills.
The market started trading down. I said to myself, "Soybeans were supposed to be limit-up for
three days, and they can't even hold limit-up the first morning." I immediately called my broker and
frantically told him to sell, sell, sell!
Did you get out of your whole position?
Not only that, but I was so excited that I lost count of how much I was selling. I accidentally wound
up being short a substantial amount of soybeans, which I bought back 40 to 50 cents lower. That
was the only time I made a lot of money on an error.
I remember a situation just like that. It was the cotton bull market when prices almost
reached $1 a pound. To this day, I recall I was long cotton and the week's export figure came
out showing a half million bales of exports to China. It was the most bullish cotton export figure I
had ever seen. But instead of opening limit-up the next day, the market opened only about 150
points higher and then started trading off. That proved to be the exact high.
Another interesting example, I remember, occurred when we were in a very inflationary period and
all the commodity markets were trading in lockstep fashion. On one particularly powerful day,
almost all the markets went limit-up. On that day, cotton opened limit-up, fell back, and finished
only marginally higher for the day. That was the market peak. Everything else stayed locked limit-
up, but cotton never saw the light of day again.
Is the implied rule that if you find a common behavior between markets, you want to sell the
one that is lagging as soon as it starts heading down?
You absolutely want to put down a bet when a market acts terribly relative to everything else.
When the news is wonderful and a market can't go up, then you want to be sure to be short.
What kinds of misconceptions about the markets get people into trouble?
Well, I think the leading cause of financial disablement is the belief that you can rely on the experts
to help you. It might, if you know the right expert. For example, if you happen to be Paul Tudor
Jones' barber, and he is talking about the market, it might not be a bad idea to listen. Typically,
however, these so-called "experts" are not traders. Your average broker couldn't be a trader in a
million years. More money is lost listening to brokers than any other way. Trading requires an
intense personal involvement. You have to do your own homework, and that is what I advise
people to do.
Any other misconceptions?
26



==================================================
                     PAGE 27                      
==================================================

The foolish belief that there is conspiracy in the markets. I have known many of the great traders in
the world, and I can say that 99 percent of the time, the market is bigger than anybody and, sooner
or later, it goes where it wants to go. There are exceptions, but they don't last too long.
You have attributed a lot of your success to Ed and Amos who taught you the principles of
trading. Have you, in turn, taught other traders?
Yes. My best result, in terms of his becoming the best trader I ever worked with, as well as being a
close friend, is Bruce Kovner.
How much of his success do you attribute to your training, and how much of it was just his own
talent?
When I first met Bruce, he was a writer and a professor; in his spare time, he was doing some
trading. I was staggered by the breadth of trading knowledge he had accumulated in such a short
time. I remember the first day I met Bruce I tried to impress him with complicated concepts. Here I
was, a professional trader who, in those days, spent fifteen hours a day trading and analyzing the
markets, and I couldn't come up with anything that he couldn't understand. I recognized his talent
immediately.
That relates to his intellect, but was there something about him that told you that he was
going to be a good trader?
Yes, his objectivity. A good trader can't be rigid. If you can find somebody who is really open to
seeing anything, then you have found the raw ingredient of a good trader—and I saw that in Bruce
right away. I knew from the moment I first met him that he was going to be a great trader. What I
tried to do was convey to Brace the principles that Ed and Amos had taught me, along with some of
my acquired skills. My best trading occurred when Brace and I were collaborating; we did some
phenomenal trading. There were years when I was up 300 percent and he was up 1,000 percent. He
had a very great gift.
Do you feel you get ground down as a trader?
Absolutely. Around 1983,1 began to taper off in my trading. I felt that I needed to recharge my
batteries.
How important is gut feel in trading?
Gut feel is very important. I don't know of any great professional trader that doesn't have it. Being a
successful trader also takes courage: the courage to try, the courage to fail, the courage to succeed,
and the courage to keep on going when the going gets tough.
Do you have any goals aside from trading at this point?
I have taken karate for many years. I am already at a high level, but I would like to get the black
belt. Also, I have made a study of spiritual traditions and there is a bit more work I would like to do
with that.
You sound very vague about it. Do you want to be vague?
It is very hard to talk about this. Let me see how I can put it. Albert Einstein said that the single
most important question is whether the universe is friendly. I think it is important for everybody to
come to a point where they feel inside that the universe is friendly.
Are you there now?
I'm a lot closer.
But that's not where you started off ?
No. I started off with the feeling that it was an unfriendly place.
Do you see yourself trading ten or twenty years from now?
Yes, it's too much fun to give up. I don't want to make a lot more money. I would probably just end
up losing it in real estate again.
Is the fun aspect still there if you are doing it thirteen hours a day?
No. If trading is your life, it is a torturous kind of excitement. But if you are keeping your life in
balance, then it is fun. All the successful traders I've seen that lasted in the business sooner or later
27



==================================================
                     PAGE 28                      
==================================================

got to that point. They have a balanced life; they have fun outside of trading. You can't sustain it if
you don't have some other focus. Eventually, you wind up overtrading or getting excessively
disturbed about temporary failures.
When you do hit a losing streak, how do you handle it?
In the past, I've sometimes tried to fight back by trading even heavier after I start losing, but that
usually doesn't work. Then I start cutting down very fast to the point of stopping completely if it
gets bad enough. But usually it never gets that bad.
Do you sometimes manage to fight your way out of it?
Sometimes, but most of the time I would have been better off if I had just stopped. I've had trouble
bringing myself to do that, because I am a natural fighter. The typical pattern is: Lose, fight like
hell, lose again, then cut back, or sometimes stop, until I get on a winning track.
How long have you stopped for?
Usually three, four weeks.
When you are in a losing streak, is it because you are out of sync with the markets, or is there
a better way to describe it?
I think that, in the end, losing begets losing. When you start losing, it touches off negative elements
in your psychology; it leads to pessimism.
There are very few traders who have been as successful as you. What do you think makes you
different?
I am very open-minded. I am willing to take in information that is difficult to accept emotionally,
but which I still recognize to be true. For example, I have seen others make money much faster than
I have only to wind up giving everything back, because when they started losing, they couldn't stop.
When I have had a bad losing streak, I have been able to say to myself, "You just can't trade
anymore." When a market moves counter to my expectations, I have always been able to say, "I
had hoped to make a lot of money in this position, but it isn't working, so I'm getting out."
Do you keep track of your equity on a day-to-day basis? Do you actually plot it?
I have done that a lot in the past.
Is that helpful? Do you think it's a good idea for traders to plot their equity?
I think so. If the trend in your equity is down, that is a sign to cut back and reevaluate. Or if you see
that you are losing money a lot faster than you made it, that would be a warning.
Are there any advisors you pay attention to?
My favorite market letter in terms of readability, imagination, and knowledge of the subject is the
California Technology Stock Letter (CTSL Publishing Partners, 155 Montgomery Street, Suite
1401, San Francisco, CA 94104). I also like the market letters put out by Marty Zweig
(TheZweigLetter, The Zweig Forecast, P.O. Box 360, Bellmore, NY 11710) and Richard Russell
(Dow Theory Letters, Dow Theory Letters Inc., P.O. Box 1759, LaJolla, CA 92038).
Of the traders I have interviewed, Zweig is probably the one most mentioned.
You always get something of value out of Marty Zweig. He is very solid.
Judging by the letters you have mentioned, I take it that you trade stocks as well. How long
have you been trading stocks?
For about the last two years.
Do you trade stocks differently than you trade futures?
I'm more patient.
Is the selection process different?
No, I look for confirmation from the chart, the fundamentals, and the market action. I think you can
trade anything in the world that way.
Do you focus on any particular types of stock?
I don't trade the Dow stocks. I prefer the little ones, because they are not dominated by the big
28



==================================================
                     PAGE 29                      
==================================================

professional traders who are like sharks eating each other. The basic principle is that it is better to
trade the Australian dollar than the Deutsche mark, and the small OTC stock than the big Dow
stock.
What are the fundamentals you look for in a stock?
I like to use something I found in Investor's Daily: the earnings per share (EPS). [The EPS ranking
is based on comparing the earnings per share growth of a stock relative to all other stocks. For more
details on the EPS, see the William O'Neil and David Ryan interviews.] I combine the EPS with my
own sense of market share potential. If a company has already saturated their little niche in the
world, a high EPS is not that important. But, in those issues where the EPS is growing, and there is
still plenty of pie out there, the situation is much more attractive.
I also like to look at the price/earnings (P/E) ratio in conjunction with the EPS. hi other words,
while I like to see a company with a strong earnings growth pattern, I also want to know how much
the market is paying for that earnings growth pattern.
So you like seeing a high EPS with a low P/E.
Yes. That's the best combination. I am sure there is a way of combining the two on a computer and
coming up with a very good system.
How about the relative strength [a measure of a stock's price performance relative to all other
stocks], which is another key indicator in Investor's Daily!
I don't think that helps that much. Relative strength tells you what a stock has already done.
Frequently, by the time you get a high relative strength figure, the stock has exhausted itself.
Is there anything else you look for in a stock?
I look at the basic industry. For example, right now [May 1988], I happen to be bullish on tanker
rates and, therefore, the shipping business.
For what reasons?
Supply and demand. Tanker rates are like commodity prices; they follow a classic cyclical pattern.
Prices get high and everyone makes a lot of money, so they build a lot of ships and prices go down.
Eventually the ships are scrapped and prices go back up again. We have had very low rates for
many years and have scrapped a lot of tankers annually. So we are entering that part of the cycle
where prices go back up again.
Does trading become more difficult as the size of the account gets bigger?
Yes, because you are forced to compete in fewer and fewer markets that are being traded by other
big professionals.
How much common behavior is there between different markets? For example, can you trade
bonds in the same way you trade corn?
I really feel that if you can trade one market, you can trade them all. The! principles are the same.
Trading is emotion. It is mass psychology, greed, and fear. It is all the same in every situation.
For most great traders, early failure is more the rule than the exception. Despite an incredible long-
term performance record, Michael Marcus began his trading career with an unbroken string of
trading losses. Moreover, he wiped out not just once, but several times. The moral is: Early trading
failure is a sign that you are doing something wrong; it is not necessarily a good predictor of
ultimate potential failure or success.
I found it particularly interesting that, despite a number of painful trading losses, Marcus' most
devastating experience was actually a profitable trade in which he got out prematurely. Taking
advantage of potential major winning trades is not only important to the mental health of the trader,
but is also critical to winning. In the interview, Marcus stressed that letting winners ride is every bit
as important as cutting losses short. In his own words, "If you don't stay with your winners, you are
not going to be able to pay for the losers."
Marcus learned about the dangers of overtrading the hard way. In one instance (the grain trade in
the nonexistent corn blight year), an account he had built up from a very small stake to $30,000 was
wiped out by betting all his money on a single trade. He made the same mistake a second time in
the lumber market, coming to the brink of disaster before narrowly escaping. These experiences

                     PAGE 30                      
==================================================

had a dramatic impact on Marcus' trading philosophy. It is no accident that the first rule he cites
when asked to give advice to the average trader is: Never commit more than 5 percent of your
money to a single trade idea.
In addition to not overtrading, Marcus stresses the importance of committing to an exit point on
every trade. He feels that protective stops are very important because they force this commitment
on the trader. He also recommends liquidating positions to achieve mental clarity when one is
losing money and is confused regarding market decisions.
Marcus also emphasizes the necessity of following your own mind as a trader. He suggests that
following the advice of others, even when they are good traders, often leads to problems as it
combines the worst elements of both traders.
Finally, despite being an aggressive trader, Marcus strongly believes in being restrictive in
selecting trades. He advises waiting for those trades in which all the key elements line up in one
direction. By doing so you greatly enhance the probability of success on each trade. Making lots of
trades when the conditions appear to be only marginally in favor of the trade idea has more to do
with entertainment than trading success.

Bruce Kovner-The World Trader
Today, Bruce Kovner may well be the world's largest trader in the interbank currency and futures
markets. In 1987 alone, he scored profits in excess of $300 million for himself and the fortunate
investors in his funds. During the past ten years, Kovner has realized a remarkable 87 percent
averaged annual compounded return. Two thousand dollars invested with Kovner in early 1978
would have been worth over $1,000,000 ten years later.
Despite his incredible track record and huge trading size, Kovner has managed to keep a
surprisingly low profile. He has assiduously pursued his privacy by steadfastly refusing all
interview requests. "You might be wondering why I consented to this interview," he said. As a
matter of fact, I was, but I did not want to raise the question. I had assumed that his agreement
reflected a vote of confidence and trust. Seven years earlier, our paths had crossed briefly when we
both worked at Commodities Corporation—he as one of the firm's principal traders, I as an analyst.
Kovner continued, "It seems like I can't avoid some publicity, and the stories are usually distorted
and fanciful. I thought that this interview would help establish at least one accurate record."
Kovner hardly fits the intuitive image of a trader who typically holds positions with a total face
value measured in billions of dollars. With his incisive intellect and easygoing manner, he reminds
one more of a professor than a giant-scale trader in the highly leveraged currency and futures
markets. Indeed, Kovner started out as an academic.
After graduating from Harvard, Kovner taught political science courses at Harvard and the
University of Pennsylvania. Although he liked teaching, he was not enthused with the academic
life. "I didn't enjoy the process of always confronting a blank page in the morning and thinking of
something brilliant to write."
In the early 1970s, Kovner managed a number of political campaigns, with the idea of eventually
running for office himself. He abandoned politics because he didn't have the financial resources, or
the desire to work his way up the political ladder from committee jobs. During this time he also
worked as a consultant for various state and federal agencies.
Still searching for a career direction, Kovner shifted his attention to the financial markets in the
mid-1970s. He believed that his economics and political science education provided the right
background, and he found the idea of analyzing the world to make trading judgments tremendously
appealing. For about a year, Kovner immersed himself in studying markets and the related
economic theory. He read everything he could get his hands on.
One subject he studied intensively was interest rate theory. "I fell in love with uieyield curve." [The
yield curve is the relationship between the yield on government securities and their time to
maturity. For example, if each successively longer-term maturity provided a higher yield than a
shorter-term maturity—for example, five-year T-notes at a higher yield than one-year T-bills—the
yield curve would reflect a continually rising slope on a graph.]
Kovner's study of the interest rate markets coincided with the initial years of trading in interest rate
futures. At that time, the interest rate futures market was relatively unsophisticated and price
distortions, which would be quickly eradicated by arbitrageurs today, persisted over time. As
Kovner explains it, "The market hadn't become important enough for CitiBank or Solomon
Brothers, but it was important enough for me."
One of the primary anomalies Kovner discovered was related to the price spread (difference)
between different futures contracts. Futures are traded for specific months (for example, March,
June, September, and December). Given the prevailing phase of the business cycle, interest rate
theory predicted that the nearby contract (for example, March) should trade at a higher price (lower
yield) than the next contract (for example, June). Although the nearest two contracts did indeed
tend to reflect this relationship, Kovner found that the price difference between more forward
contracts often started trading at near-zero levels. His first trade involved buying a forward interest
rate contract and selling a more forward contract, in the expectation that, as the purchased contract
became the nearby contract with the passage of time, the price spread between the two contracts
would widen.
That first trade worked just according to textbook theory and Kovner was hooked as a trader. His
second trade also involved an intra-market spread [the purchase of one contract against the sale of
31



==================================================
                     PAGE 32                      
==================================================

another contract in the same market]. In this case, he bought the nearby copper contract and sold a
more forward contract, in the expectation that supply tightness would cause the nearby copper
contract to gain relative to the forward position. Although his idea eventually proved right, he was
too early and lost money on that trade. At the end of these two trades, Kovner was still ahead, with
his original $3,000 stake having grown to about $4,000.
My third trade is what really put me in the business. In early 1977, an apparent shortage was
developing in the soybean market. It was a demand driven market. Every week the crush was
higher than expected and nobody believed the figures. [The crush is the amount of soybeans
processed for use as soybean meal and soybean oil.] I was watching the July/November spread [the
price difference between the old crop July contract and the new crop November contract]. Since it
looked like we were going to run out of soybeans, I thought that the old crop July contract would
expand its premium to the new crop November contract. This spread had been trading in a narrow
consolidation near 60-cents premium July. I figured I could easily stop myself out just below the
consolidation at around a 45-cents premium. At the time, I didn't realize how volatile the spread
could be. I put on one spread [that is, bought July soybeans and simultaneously sold November
soybeans] near 60 cents and it widened to 70 cents. Then I put on another spread. I kept on
pyramiding.
How big of a position did you build up?
I eventually built up to aposition of about fifteen contracts, but not before I had to switch brokerage
firms. When I started out, I was trading at a small brokerage house. The head of the company, who
was an old floor trader, went over the trades every day and spotted what I was doing. By that time,
I had built my position up to about ten or fifteen contracts. The margin on a single outright contract
was $2,000, while the spread margin was only $400.
He told me, "The spread position you have on trades like an outright long position. I am going to
raise your margins from $400 to $2,000 per contract." [Spread margins are lower than outright
margins, reflecting the assumption that a net long or short position will be considerably more
volatile than a spread position. Reason: In a spread, the long contract portion of the position is
likely to at leas t partially offset price movement in the short contract position. In a shortage
situation, however, an intercrop spread, such as long July soybeans/short November soybeans can
prove to be nearly as volatile as a net long or short position.]
He was obviously quite concerned with the risk in your position.
Yes. He was concerned that I had only put up $400 margin per spread, on a spread which behaved
like a net long position.
Actually, he wasn't that far off.
He was right, but I was furious. So I moved my account to another brokerage firm, which shall
remain nameless, for reasons that will soon become clear.
You were furious because you felt he was being unfair, or—
Well, I am not sure I thought he was being unfair, but I certainly knew he was an obstacle to my
objective. I moved my account to a major brokerage house, and got a broker who was not very
competent. The market kept moving up and I kept adding to my position. I had put on my first
spread on February 25; by April 12, my account was up to $35,000.
Were you just adding to your position as the market went up, or did you have some plan?
I had a plan. I would wait until the market moved up to a certain level and then retraced by a
specified amount before adding another unit. My pyramiding did not turn out to be the problem.
The market had entered a string of limit-up moves. On April 13, the market hit a new record high.
The commotion was tremendous. My broker called me at home and said, "Soybeans are going to
the moon. It looks like July is going limit-up, and November is sure to follow. You are a fool to
stay short the November contracts. Let me lift your November shorts for you, and when the market
goes limit-up for the next few days, you will make more money." I agreed, and we covered my
November short position.
ALL of it?!
32



==================================================
                     PAGE 33                      
==================================================

All of it [he laughs loudly].
Was this a spur of the moment decision?
It was a moment of insanity. Fifteen minutes later, my broker calls me back, and he sounds frantic.
"I don't know how to tell you this, but the market is limit-downl I don't know if I can get you out." I
went into shock. I yelled at him to get me out. The market moved off of limit-down by a little bit
and I got out.
Did you end up getting out at limit-down?
I got out between limit-down and slightly above limit-down. I can tell you the dimensions of the
loss. At the moment I covered my short November position leaving myself net long July, I was up
about $45,000. By the end of the day, I had $22,000 in my account. I went into emotional shock. I
could not believe how stupid I had been—how badly I had failed to understand the market, in spite
of having studied the markets for years. I was sick to my stomach, and I didn't eat for days. I
thought that I had blown my career as a trader.
But you still had $22,000 compared to your original stake of only $3,000. Keeping things in
perspective, you were still in pretty good shape.
Absolutely. I was in good shape, but—
Was it the stupidity of the mistake or was it the money that you had given back that caused
such emotional pain?
No, it wasn't the money at all. I think it was the realization that there really was "fire" there. Until
then, I had ridden $3,000 to $45,000 without a moment of pain.
On the way up, did you think, "This is easy"?
It was easy.
Did you give any thought to the possibility that the market streak could eventually go the
other way?
No, but clearly, my decision to lift the short side of my spread position in the middle of a panic
showed a complete disregard for risk. I think what bothered me so much was the realization that I
had lost a process of rationality that I thought I had. At that moment, I realized that the markets
were truly capable of taking money away every bit as fast as they gave it to you. That made a very
strong impression on me. Actually, I was very lucky to get out with $22,000.
I assume that your quick action that day probably averted a complete disaster.
Absolutely. After that day, the market went straight down as fast as it had gone up. Perhaps, if I
hadn't made my stupid mistake, I might have made the mistake of riding the market down.
What eventually happened to the spread?
The spread collapsed. Eventually, it went below the level that I had first begun buying it at.
Since you liquidated your position on the day the market and the spread topped, you would
have given back a portion of the profits even if it wasn't for the disastrous decision that
forced you out of the market.
That may be true, but for me, that was my "going bust" trade. It was the closest I ever came to
going bust and, psychologically, it felt as if I had.
Was that your most painful trade?
Yes. Far and away.
Even though you actually ended up making a substantial amount of money on the trade?
I multiplied my money by nearly sixfold on that trade. I was, of course, insanely leveraged, and I
didn't understand how risky my position was.
Was getting out of your entire position immediately after your broker called to tell you the
market was limit-down a matter of panic, or do you think you had some instinctive common
sense about controlling risk?
I'm not sure. At that moment, I was confronted with the realization that I had blown a great deal of
what I thought I knew about discipline. To this day, when something happens to disturb my
33



==================================================
                     PAGE 34                      
==================================================

emotional equilibrium and my sense of what the world is like, I close out all positions related to
that event.
Do you have a recent example?
October 19,1987—the week of the stock market crash. I closed out all my positions on October 19
and 20 because I felt there was something happening in the world that I didn't understand. The first
rule of trading—there are probably many first rales—is don't get caught in a situation in which you
can lose a great deal of money for reasons you don't understand.
Let's get back to the period after your soybean trade. When did you start trading again?
About a month later. After a few months I had my account back to about $40,000. Around that
time, I answered an ad for a trading assistant position at Commodities Corporation. I was
interviewed by Michael Marcus in his usual idiosyncratic manner. He had me return to
Commodities Corporation several weeks later. "Well," he said, "I have some good news and some
bad news. The bad news is that we are not hiring you as a trading assistant; the good news is that
we are hiring you as a trader."
How much money did Commodities Corporation give you to trade?
Thirty-five thousand dollars.
Were you trading your own money, as well, at the same time?
Yes, and that is something I am very glad about. Commodities Corporation had a policy that
allowed you to trade your personal account, as well as the company account, and Michael and I
were very aggressive traders.
Were you influenced by Michael?
Oh, yes, very much. Michael taught me one thing that was incredibly important [pause].
That is a great lead-in. What is the punch line?
He taught me that you could make a million dollars. He showed me that if you applied yourself,
great things could happen. It is very easy to miss the point that you really can do it. He showed me
that if you take a position and use discipline, you can actually make it.
It sounds like he gave you confidence.
Right. He also taught me one other thing that is absolutely critical: You have to be willing to make
mistakes regularly; there is nothing wrong with it. Michael taught me about making your best
judgment, being wrong, making your next best judgment, being wrong, making your third best
judgment, and then doubling your money.
You are one of the most successful traders in the world. There are only a small number of
traders of your caliber. What makes you different from the average guy?
I'm not sure one can really define why some traders make it, while others do not. For myself, I can
think of two important elements. First, I have the ability to imagine configurations of the world
different from today and really believe it can happen. I can imagine that soybean prices can double
or that the dollar can fall to 100 yen. Second, I stay rational and disciplined under pressure.
Can trading skills be taught?
Only to a limited extent. Over the years, I have tried to train perhaps thirty people, and only four or
five of those have turned out to be good traders.
What happened to the other twenty-five?
They are out of the business—and it had nothing to do with intelligence.
When you compare the trainees that made it to the majority that did not, do you find any
distinguishing traits?
They are strong, independent, and contrary in the extreme. They are able to take positions others
are unwilling to take. They are disciplined enough to take the right size positions. A greedy trader
always blows out. I know some really inspired traders who never managed to keep the money they
made. One trader at Commodities Corporation—I don't want to mention his name—always struck
me as a brilliant trader. The ideas he came up with were wonderful; the markets he picked were
34



==================================================
                     PAGE 35                      
==================================================

often the right markets. Intellectually, he knew markets much better than I did, yet I was keeping
money, and he was not.
So where was he going wrong?
Position size. He traded much too big. For every one contract I traded, he traded ten. He would
double his money on two different occasions each year, but still end up flat.
Do you always use fundamental analysis in forming your trading decisions?
I almost always trade on a market view; I don't trade simply on technical information. I use
technical analysis a great deal and it is terrific, but I can't hold a position unless I understand why
the market should move.
Is that to say that virtually every position you take has a fundamental reason behind it?
I think that is a fair statement. But I would add that technical analysis can often clarify the
fundamental picture. I will give you an example. During the past six months, I had good arguments
for the Canadian dollar going down, and good arguments for the Canadian dollar going up. It was
unclear to me which interpretation was correct. If you had put a gun to my head and forced me to
choose a market direction, I probably would have said "down."
Then the U.S ./Canadian trade pact was announced, which changed the entire picture, hi fact, the
market had broken out on the upside a few days earlier, as the negotiations were finishing up. At
that inSant, I felt completely comfortable saying that one of the major pieces ii the valuation of the
Canadian dollar had just changed, and the marlet had already voted.
Prior to the agreement, I felt the Canadian dollar was at the top of a hill, and I wasn't sure whether
it was going to roll backwads or forwards. When the market moved, I was prepared to go with tlat
movement because we had a conjunction of two important element!: a major change in
fundamentals (although, I wasn't smart enough tc know in which direction it would impact the
market), and a techncal price breakout on the upside.
What do you mean you weren't smart enough to know in which direction the trade pact
announcement would move the market? Since U.S./Canadian trade is so much a larger
component of Canadian trade than it is of U.S. trade, wouldn't it hive been logical to assume
that the trade pact would be bullish for the Canadian dollar?
It didn't have to happen that way. I could just as easily have aigued that the trade pact was negative
for the Canadian dollar because tie elimination of the trade barriers would allow imports from the
Ш. to submerge Canadian interests. There are still some analysts who tdhere to that argument. My
point is that there are well-informed tralers who know much more than I do. I simply put things
together. Tfey knew which way to go, and they voted in the marketplace by buying Canadian
dollars.
Is the generalization of that example that when an importart fundamental development
occurs, the initial direction of the marlet move is often a good tip-off of the longer-term
trend?
Exactly. The market usually leads because there are people Wio know more than you do. For
example, the Soviet Union is a very gocd trader.
Good trader in which markets?
In currencies, and grains to some degree.
How does one know what the Soviets are doing?
Because the Soviets act through commercial banks and dealers, and you hear about it.
It seems rather contradictory to me that a country that is so poor in running its own economy
should be a good trader.
Yes, but if you ask people in the business, you will find out that they are.
Why, or how?
It is a joke, but perhaps they do read some of our mail. The Soviets (and other governments)
occasionally have advance information. Why shouldn't they? They have the best developed
intelligence service in the world. It is a well known fact in the intelligence community that the
35



==================================================
                     PAGE 36                      
==================================================

Soviets (and others) are capable of eavesdropping on commercial communication. That is why the
large commodity trading firms sometimes use scramblers when they are making very sensitive
calls.
My point is that there are thousands of difficult-to-understand mechanisms that lead the market,
which come into play before the news reaches some poor trader sitting at his desk. But the one
thing that does hit the market is a huge sale or purchase.
Isn't that the basic rationalization for technical analysis?
Technical analysis, I think, has a great deal that is right and a great deal that is mumbo jumbo.
That's an interesting statement. What's right and what's black magic?
There is a great deal of hype attached to technical analysis by some technicians who claim that it
predicts the future. Technical analysis tracks the past; it does not predict the future. You have to use
your own intelligence to draw conclusions about what the past activity of some traders may say
about the future activity of other traders.
For me, technical analysis is like a thermometer. Fundamentalists who say they are not going to pay
any attention to the charts are like a doctor who says he's not going to take a patient's temperature.
But, of course, that would be sheer folly. If you are a responsible participant in the market, you
always want to know where the market is—whether it is hot and excitable, or cold and stagnant.
You want to know everything you can about the market to give you an edge.
Technical analysis reflects the vote of the entire marketplace and, therefore, does pick up unusual
behavior. By definition, anything that creates a new chart pattern is something unusual. It is very
important for me to study the details of price action to see if I can observe something about how
everybody is voting. Studying the charts is absolutely crucial and alerts me to existing disequilibria
and potential changes.
Do you sometimes put on a trade because you look at a chart and say, "I've seen this pattern
before, and it is often a forerunner of a market advance." That is, even though you may not
have any fundamental reasons?
Yes, I will do that sometimes. I would only add that, as a trader who has seen a great deal and been
in a lot of markets, there is nothing disconcerting to me about a price move out of a trading range
that nobody understands.
Does that imply you usually go with breakouts?
Sure.
But the markets are often prone to false breakouts. There has to be more to it than that.
Tight congestions in which a breakout occurs for reasons that nobody understands are usually good
risk/reward trades.
How about breakouts that occur because there is a story in the Wall Street Journal that day?
That would be much less relevant. The Heisenberg principle in physics provides an analogy for the
markets. If something is closely observed, the odds are it is going to be altered in the process. If
corn is in a tight consolidation and then breaks out the day the Wall Street Journal carries a story
about a potential shortage of corn, the odds of the price move being sustained are much smaller. If
everybody believes there is no reason for corn to break out, and it suddenly does, the chances that
there is an important underlying cause are much greater.
It sounds like you are saying that the less explanation there is for a price move occurring, the
better it looks.
Well, I do think that. The more a price pattern is observed by speculators, the more prone you are to
have false signals. The more a market is the product of nonspeculative activity, the greater the
significance of technical breakouts.
Has the greatly increased use of computerized trend-following systems increased the
frequency of false technical signals?
I think so. The fact that there are billions of dollars out there trading on technical systems that use
moving averages or other simple pattern recognition approaches helps produce many more false
36



==================================================
                     PAGE 37                      
==================================================

signals. I have developed similar systems myself, so that I can tell when the other systems are
going to kick in. If it is clear that prices are moving because these billions are kicking into the
market, it is a lot less interesting than if a breakout occurs because the Russians are buying.
Let's say you do buy a market on an upside breakout from a consolidation phase, and the
price starts to move against you—that is, back into the range. How do you know when to get
out? How do you tell the difference between a small pullback and a bad trade?
Whenever I enter a position, I have a predetermined stop. That is the only way I can sleep. I know
where I'm getting out before I get in. The position size on a trade is determined by the stop, and the
stop is determined on a technical basis. For example, if the market is in the midst of a trading range,
it makes no sense to put your stop within that range, since you are likely to be taken out. I always
place my stop beyond some technical barrier.
Don't you run into the problem that a lot of other people may be using the same stop point,
and the market may be drawn to that stop level?
I never think about that, because the point about a technical barrier—and I've studied the technical
aspects of the market for a long time—is that the market shouldn't go there if you are right. I try to
avoid a point that floor traders can get at easily. Sometimes I may place my stop at an obvious
point, if I believe that it is too far away or too difficult to reach easily.
To take an actual example, on a recent Friday afternoon, the bonds witnessed a high-velocity
breakdown out of an extended trading range. As far as I could tell, this price move came as a
complete surprise. I felt very comfortable selling the bonds on the premise that if I was right about
the trade, the market should not make it back through a certain amount of a previous overhead
consolidation. That was my stop. I slept easily in that position, because I knew that I would be out
of the trade if that happened.
Talking about stops, I assume because of the size that you trade, your stops are always mental
stops, or is that not necessarily true?
Let's put it this way: I've organized my life so that the stops get taken care of. They are never on the
floor, but they are not mental.
What eventually tells you that you are wrong on a major position trade? Your stop point will
limit your initial loss, but if you still believe in the fundamental analysis underlying the trade,
I assume that you will try it again. If you are wrong about the general direction of the market,
won't you take a series of losses? At what point do you throw in the towel on the trade idea?
First of all, a loss of money itself slows me down, so I reduce my positions. Secondly, in the
situation you described, the change in the technical picture will give me second thoughts. For
example, if I am bearish on the dollar and a major intermediate high has been penetrated, I would
have to reevaluate my view.
Earlier you mentioned that you had developed your own trend-following systems to provide
an indicator of where the large amount of money managed under such systems could be
expected to hit the market. Do you use your own trend-following systems to trade any portion
of the money you manage?
Yes, about 5 percent.
Is that the level of your confidence? I guess it is not negative 5 percent, so it could be worse.
Overall, my systems make money, but they have volatility characteristics, and problems related to
risk control that I don't like. But, since they offer diversification from my other trading, I use them
to a small degree.
Do you feel it is possible to ever develop a system that would do as well as a good trader?
I think it is unlikely because the learning features of such a system would have to be very highly
developed. Computers are good at "learning" only when there are clear hierarchies of information
and precedent. For example, expert systems for medical diagnostics are very good because the rules
are very clear. The problem with developing expert systems for trading is that the "rules" of the
trading and investment game keep changing. I have spent some time working with expert system
developers, and we concluded that trading was a poor candidate for this approach, because trading

                     PAGE 38                      
==================================================

decisions encompass too many types of knowledge, and the rules for interpreting the information
keep changing.
Does the fact that you are trading so much greater size than you did in your early years make
it more difficult?
There are far fewer markets with sufficient liquidity for the optimum size of my trades.
How much money are you currently managing?
Over $650 million.
I assume more than half of that is due to capital appreciation.
Yes, last year's profits alone were about $300 million.
What are some markets that you really have trouble trading because of insufficient liquidity?
An example of a market I like a great deal, but in which the liquidity is often poor, is copper, hi
copper, I am now the elephant.
What kind of size can be moved comfortably in a market like copper before it becomes a
problem?
I would say, in a day, you can comfortably move 500 to 800 contracts; uncomfortably, somewhat
more than that. But the daily volume of copper is currently only 7,000 to 10,000 contracts and a lot
of that is local trading or spreads. In contrast, in the T-bond market, you can move 5,000 contracts
without a problem. You can also move very large size, in the interbank currency market.
Can you trade a market like coffee, which doesn't have deep liquidity, but sometimes can
develop enormous trends?
Yes, I did trade coffee last year and made a few million dollars in it. Now, if I am managing $600
million, and I kick in $2 million in profits on coffee trades, it doesn't really matter that much. In
fact, it could even be counterproductive, since the time and energy I spend concentrating on coffee
diminishes my focus on the currency markets, which I trade far more heavily.
It would appear that you have reached a size level that impedes your trading performance.
Since you have substantial personal funds, did you ever consider just trading your own
money and avoiding all the related headaches in managing money?
Yes, but there are several reasons why I don't. Although I invest a great deal of my own money in
my funds, the portion of my funds that is managed money represents a call. [Analogy to an option
that has unlimited profit potential in the event of a price rise, but risk limited to its cost in the event
of a decline.] I don't say this to be flippant, since my reputation among my investors is extremely
important to me, but a call is a much better position than a symmetrical win/lose position.
Is there a practical limit to the amount of money you can manage?
In most commodity futures markets, there certainly is. However, in currencies, interest rates, and a
few commodities such as crude oil, there are limits, but they are very high. I plan to very carefully
manage the future growth in the size of funds I am managing.
When you put in orders in markets that are not among the most liquid—in other words, not
T-bonds or the major currencies—do you find your orders actually moving the market?
They can, but I never bully a market.
Talking about that, one often hears stories about very large traders trying to push the
markets up or down. Does that work?
I don't think so. It can be done for the short term, but eventually it will lead to serious mistakes. It
usually results in arrogance and a loss of touch with the underlying market structure, both
fundamentally and technically. The traders that I know who thought too highly of their ability and
tried to bully the market, ultimately made the mistake of overtrading and went under.
Without mentioning any names, can you provide an example?
There is a recent example of a British trading organization getting into serious trouble after they
tried to corner the crude oil market. At first they succeeded, but then they lost control and crude oil
prices fell by $4.

                     PAGE 39                      
==================================================

What was the end result?
They lost about $40 million and the organization is in trouble.
You are probably managing more money than any other futures trader in the world. How do
you handle the emotional strain when you hit a losing period?
The emotional burden of trading is substantial; on any given day, I could lose millions of dollars. If
you personalize these losses, you can't trade.
Do the losses bother you at all anymore?
The only thing that disturbs me is poor money management. Every so often, I take a loss that is
significantly too large. But I never had a lot of difficulty with the process of losing money, as long
as losses were the outcome of sound trading techniques. Lifting the short side of the July/November
soybean spread was an example that scared me. I learned a lot about risk control from that
experience. But as a day-in, day-out process, taking losses does not bother me.
Did you have any losing years?
Yes, in 19811 lost about 16 percent.
Was that due to errors you made, or the nature of the markets?
It was a combination of the two. My main problem was that it was the first major bear market in
commodities I had experienced, and bear markets have different characteristics than bull markets.
Was it a matter of becoming complacent about markets always being in an uptrend?
No, the problem was that the principal characteristic of a bear market is very sharp down
movements followed by quick retracements. I would always sell too late and then get stopped out
in what subsequently proved to be part of a wide-swinging congestion pattern. In a bear market,
you have to use sharp countertrend rallies to enter positions.
What other mistakes did you make that year?
My money management was poor. I had too many correlated trades.
Was your confidence shaken at all that year? Did you go back to the drawing board?
I went back and designed a lot of risk management systems. I paid strict attention to the
correlations of all my positions. From that point on, I measured my total risk in the market every
day.
When you trade currencies, do you use the interbank market or the futures market?
I only use the interbank market, unless I am doing an arbitrage trade against the /MM. [The
International Monetary Market (IMM) is a subsidiary of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the
world's foremost currency futures exchange.] The liquidity is enormously better, the transaction
costs are much lower, and it is a twenty-four-hour market, which is important to us because we
literally trade twenty-four hours a day.
What portion of your trading is in currencies?
On average, about 50 to 60 percent of our profits come from currency trading.
I assume you are also trading currencies beyond the five that are currently actively traded on
the IMM.
We trade any currency that is highly liquid. Virtually all the European currencies (including those
of the Scandinavian countries), all the major Asian currencies and the Mideast currencies. Crosses
are probably the most important trading vehicle that we use that you can't trade on the IMM.
[Crosses are a trade involving two foreign countries. For example, buying British pounds and
selling an equal dollar amount of Deutsche marks is a cross.] You can't trade crosses on the IMM
because they have fixed contract sizes.
But you could do a cross on the IMM by adjusting the ratio of the number of contracts
between the two currencies to equalize the dollar value of each position.
But it is much more exact and direct to use the interbank market. For example, Deutsche
mark/British pound and Deutsche mark/Japanese yen crosses are highly traded and very active.
I assume that when you do a mark/yen cross, you price it in dollars, not in terms of one of the

                     PAGE 40                      
==================================================

two currencies.
That's right. You simply say: Buy $100 [million] worth of marks and sell $100 [million] worth of
yen. In the interbank market, the dollar is the unit of exchange all over the world.
In situations where a surprise news development or the release of an economic statistic out of
line with expectations causes a sharp price response in currencies, does the interbank market
react less violently than the futures market, or do the arbitrageurs keep the two markets
tightly linked?
The two markets are well arbitraged, but those are the moments when a very swift arbitrageur will
make some money. The markets do get a little bit out of line, but not a lot.
Will the interbank market price response to such events be less extreme?
Yes, because what happens on the futures market is that the locals back away and let the stops run.
The only thing that pulls the markets back is the arbitrageurs who have the bank on the other side.
What percentage of bank market trading represents commercial activity, or hedging, vis-a-
vis speculative trades?
The Fed has done a study on that. I don't have the figures on hand, but it is basically a hedging
market. The banks are the principal speculators, as well as a few players like myself.
Is there a reason why the futures market hasn't been able to capture a larger percentage of
world currency trading?
The currency futures market is not efficient in several of the most important respects. First, hedging
usually has a specific dollar and date requirement. For example, if I need to hedge $3.6 million for
April 12, the bank just takes it. The futures market, however, trades only for specific dates and
fixed contract sizes, so the hedger is not precisely covered.
So actually there is no way the futures market can compete, because the interbank market
can tailor a hedge for any customer.
That's right. In addition, the activity takes place within normal commercial banking relations. That
is, very often, the hedger wants to show his banking interest that he has a locked-in profit so he can
borrow against it.
Can you talk about your fundamental analysis methodology? How do you determine what the
right price for a market should be?
I assume that the price for a market on any given day is the correct price, then I try to figure out
what changes are occurring that will alter that price.
One of the jobs of a good trader is to imagine alternative scenarios. I try to form many different
mental pictures of what the world should be like and wait for one of them to be confirmed. You
keep trying them on one at a time. Inevitably, most of these pictures will turn out to be wrong—that
is, only a few elements of the picture may prove correct. But then, all of a sudden, you will find that
in one picture, nine out of ten elements click. That scenario then becomes your image of the world
reality.
Let me give you an example. The Friday after the October 19 stock market crash, I had trouble
sleeping, which is very unusual for me. But I am sure I wasn't the only trader to lie awake that
night. All week long, I struggled with how the events of that week were going to impact the dollar.
I was trying on different visions of the world. One of these pictures was total panic—the world
coming to an end, financially.
In this scenario, the dollar becomes the safest political haven, and as a result, there could be a
tremendous rise in the dollar. In fact, on Tuesday of that week, the dollar did rise dramatically as
many people withdrew their money from other places. During the next three days, there was
tremendous confusion. By the end of the week, the dollar had started to give ground again.
It was then that it all coalesced in my mind. It became absolutely clear to me that given the
combination of a need for stimulative action, dictated by the tremendous worldwide financial panic,
the reluctance of the Bank of Japan and German Bundesbank to adopt potentially inflationary
measures, and the continuing wide U.S. trade deficits, the only solution was for Treasury Secretary
Baker to let the dollar go. Someone had to play the stimulative role, and that someone would be the
40



==================================================
                     PAGE 41                      
==================================================

United States.
As a result, the dollar would drop and it would not be in the interest of the other central banks to
defend it. I was absolutely convinced that was the only thing that Baker could do.
You realized all this late Friday. Was it too late to take action in the markets?
Yes, and it was a very tense weekend because I realized that the dollar might open sharply lower. I
waited for the Far East markets to open Sunday night.
Do you do a lot of your trading outside of U.S. hours?
Yes. First, I have monitors everywhere I go—in my home, in my country home. Second, I have a
staff on duty twenty-four hours a day.
Is your staff instructed to alert you immediately in case something big happens?
Absolutely. First of all, we have call levels in every currency. If a currency breaks out of a range
that we have previously identified, my staff is under instructions to call.
How often do you get calls in the middle of the night?
I have an assistant trader, and the joke is that he is allowed to wake me up at home twice a year.
But it really isn't necessary very often. Whenever the markets are busy, I know what is going on all
the time. My home is fully equipped with trading monitors and direct lines. Also, my assistant's job
is to be up and get the calls. He probably gets called three or four times a night.
Are you saying that you delegate the nighttime decision making?
We create a scenario for every currency at least once a week. We define the ranges we expect for
each currency and what we will do if it breaks out of these ranges.
So your assistant knows that if currency X gets to 135 He should buy it or sell it?
Those decisions have been made beforehand. But they are under instruction to call me if the Prime
Minister resigns, or if there is a major unexpected currency revaluation, or something else happens
to invalidate the recent scenario.
Are there times you end up trading at night?
Yes, a lot.
You obviously can't trade round the clock. How do you structure your time to balance your
work versus your personal life?
I generally try to keep my trading confined between 8 A.M. and 6 or 7 P.M. The Far East is very
important, and if the currency markets are very active, I will trade the Far East, which opens at 8
P.M. The A.M. session in Tokyo trades until 12 P.M. If the markets are in a period of tremendous
movement, I will go to bed for a couple of hours and get up to catch the next market opening. It is
tremendously interesting and exciting.
To see the wave roll from country to country?
Absolutely. When you are really involved, the screen almost reaches out and grabs you. The way
the quotes are made changes: They get wider; they get wilder. I have contacts all over the world in
each of these markets and I know what is going on. It is a tremendously exciting game. There are
opportunities all the time. Forgetting trading for a minute, one of the reasons I am in this business is
that I find the analysis of worldwide political and economic events extraordinarily fascinating.
The way you describe it, you make the whole process sound like a constant game, rather than
work. Do you really look at it that way?
It doesn't feel like work, except when you lose—then it feels like work [he laughs]. For me, market
analysis is like a tremendous multidimensional chess board. The pleasure of it is purely intellectual.
For example, it is trying to figure out the problems the finance minister of New Zealand faces and
how he may try to solve them. A lot of people will think that sounds ridiculously exotic. But to me,
it isn't exotic at all. Here is a guy running this tiny country and he has a real set of problems. He has
to figure how to cope with Australia, the U.S., and the labor unions that are driving him crazy. My
job is to do the puzzle with him and figure out what he is going to decide, and what the
consequences of his actions will be that he or the market doesn't anticipate. That to me, in itself, is
tremendous fun.

                     PAGE 42                      
==================================================

In following all these varied world markets, I know you read a tremendous amount of
economic literature. Do you also pay any attention to the various market advisory letters?
I get a "guru report" every day.
Who is on that list?
All the newsletter writers who have a large following. People like Prech-ter, Zweig, Davis, Eliades,
and so on.
Do you use your guru report as a measure of contrary opinion?
I try not to be too much of a wise guy because during major price moves, they will be right for a
portion of it. What I am really looking for is a consensus that the market is not confirming. I like to
know that there are a lot of people who are going to be wrong.
So if you see that most of the members on your guru list are bullish at a time when the market
is not moving up, and you have some fundamental reason to be bearish, you will feel stronger
about the trade?
Yes, much stronger.
Do you think people can trade profitably by just following the gurus?
Probably, but my impression is that to make money, you have to hold a position with conviction.
That is very difficult when you are following someone else. There are some good gurus, however.
For example, in the stock market, I like Marty Zweig. He uses excellent risk control. Unlike some
other gurus, he doesn't believe he is predicting the future; he is simply observing what is happening
and making rational bets.
You talk about both the importance of risk control and the necessity of having the conviction
to hold a position. How much risk do you typically take on a trade?
First of all, I try very hard not to risk more than 1 percent of my portfolio on any single trade.
Second, I study the correlation of my trades to reduce my exposure. We do a daily computer
analysis to see how correlated our positions are. Through bitter experience, I have learned that a
mistake in position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading. If you
have eight highly correlated positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as
large.
Does that mean if you are bullish in both the Deutsche mark and Swiss franc, then you decide
which one you like better and place your entire long position in that currency?
Yes, that is definitely true. But even more important is the idea of trading a long in one market
against a short in a related market. For example, right now, although I am net short the dollar, I am
long the yen and short the Deutsche mark. In all my trading, if I am long something, I like to be
short something else.
Do the cross rates like the Deutsche mark/Japanese yen move slower than the individual
currencies themselves?
Not necessarily. For example, recently the sterling/mark cross rate was in a yearlong congestion
between approximately 2.96 and 3.00. It finally broke out about a month ago. The day it broke out,
it challenged the top of the range about twenty times. The Bank of England kept on defending it.
Finally the Bank of England gave in. As soon as the cross rate pierced the 3.01 level, there were no
trades. In fact, there were no trades until it hit 3.0350. So it moved virtually a full 1 percent without
trading.
Is that unusual for the interbank market?
Very unusual. It meant everybody was watching the 3.00 level. Once everyone realized the Bank of
England was not stepping in, no one wanted to be a seller.
Is that type of breakout—a violent and quick one—much more reliable than a typical
breakout?
Yes, it is much more reliable.
Even though your fills are worse?
Terrible fills. The worse the fills are, the better your trade. In that case, after trading for a couple of
42



==================================================
                     PAGE 43                      
==================================================

hours between 3.04 and 3.02, the rate went straight up to 3.11.
Do you believe that the cross rates provide better trading opportunities in currencies than net
short or long positions against the dollar?
Yes, because there are a lot fewer people paying attention to the cross rates. The general rule is:
The less observed, the better the trade.
Your trading style involves a synthesis of fundamental and technical analysis. But if I were to
say to you, Bruce, we are going to put you in a room and you can have either all the
fundamental information you want, or all the charts and technical input you want, but only
one, which would you choose?
That is like asking a doctor whether he would prefer treating a patient with diagnostics or with a
chart monitoring his condition. You need both. But, if anything, the fundamentals are more
important now. In the 1970s, it was a lot easier to make money using technical analysis alone.
There were far fewer false breakouts. Nowadays, everybody is a chartist, and there are a huge
number of technical trading systems. I think that change has made it much harder for the technical
trader.
Do you think that the trend-following system approach will eventually self-destruct under the
weight of its own size and the fact that most of these systems are using similar approaches?
I think that is true. The only thing that will save those technical systems is a period of high
inflation, when simple trend-following methodologies will work again. However, there is no
question in my mind that if we have stable, moderate rates of inflation, the technical trading
systems will kill each other off.
Let's shift our conversation to the stock market. Do you believe that the stock market behaves
differently from other markets, and if so, how?
The stock market has far more short-term countertrends. After the market has gone up, it always
wants to come down. The commodity markets аre driven by supply and demand for physical goods;
if there is a true shortage, prices will tend to keep trending higher.
So if the stock index market is much choppier, are there any technical approaches that can
work?
Perhaps, but they keep changing. I have found that very long-term decision-making systems will
catch the bigger stock market advances, but you need to use very wide stops.
So you have to be very long term to filter out the noise.
Much longer than most traders can handle because that strategy involves riding out large
retracements. As an alternative approach, one of the traders I know does very well in the stock
index markets by trying to figure out how the stock market can hurt the most traders. It seems to
work for him.
How can he quantify that?
He looks at market sentiment numbers, but basically it is a matter of gut feel.
Some critics have attributed the October 1987 crash to program trading. What are your own
feelings?
I think two different elements were involved. First, overly high prices left the stock market
vulnerable to a decline, which was triggered by rising interest rates and other fundamental causes.
Second, that decline was accentuated by heavy selling from pension funds who were involved in
so-called portfolio insurance.
Are we talking about portfolio insurance as opposed to arbitrage-type program trading!
[Portfolio insurance involves systematically selling stock index futures as stock prices decline
(and covering those shorts when prices rise) in order to reduce portfolio risk. Program trading
normally refers to buying and selling stock index futures against an opposite position in a basket of
stocks when the prices of the two are out of line.]
Right. The only way in which arbitrage could be said to have contributed to the problem, rather
than helped it, is that if it weren’t for program trading arbitrage, portfolio insurance may never have
43



==================================================
                     PAGE 44                      
==================================================

been developed.
So the arbitrageurs are only to be blamed for the market decline insofar as they made
portfolio insurance possible?
Yes. If you read the Brady report, you will see that the portfolio insurers came into the market with
billions of dollars worth of sales in a few hours. The market was unable to absorb it. Portfolio
insurance was a terrible idea; it was insurance in name only. In fact, it was nothing more than a
massive stop-loss order. If it were not for portfolio insurance selling, the market would still have
gone down sharply, but nothing like the 500-point decline we witnessed.
Do you feel great traders have a special talent?
In a sense. By definition, there can only be a relatively small group of superior traders, since
trading is a zero-sum game.
What is the balance of trading success between talent and hard work?
If you don't work very hard, it is extremely unlikely that you will be a good trader.
Are there some traders who can just coast by on innate skills?
You can do that for a while. There are a lot of one-year wonders in trading. It is quite common to
find somebody who has a strong feeling that sugar is going to 40 cents, or that the copper spreads
are going to widen dramatically, and that one idea turns out right. For example, recently I heard
about a trader who made $27 million trading copper spreads this past year, and then lost virtually
all of it.
What advice would you give the novice trader?
First, I would say that risk management is the most important thing to be well understood.
Undertrade, undertrade, undertrade is my second piece of advice. Whatever you think your position
ought to be, cut it at least in half. My experience with novice traders is that they trade three to five
times too big. They are taking 5 to 10 percent risks on a trade when they should be taking 1 to 2
percent risks.
Besides overtrading, what other mistakes do novice traders typically make?
They personalize the market. A common mistake is to think of the market as a personal nemesis.
The market, of course, is totally impersonal; it doesn't care whether you make money or not.
Whenever a trader says, "I wish," or "I hope," he is engaging in a destructive way of thinking
because it takes attention away from the diagnostic process.
In my conversation with Kovner, I was struck by the immense complexity and scope of his
analysis. I still can't figure out how he can find the time to follow and analyze intricately the
economies of so many different countries, let alone integrate these various analyses into a single
picture. Clearly, Kovner's unique synthesis of worldwide fundamental and technical analysis is
hardly translatable to the average trader. Nevertheless, there are key elements in Kovner's trading
approach that have direct relevance to the more mundane trader.
Kovner lists risk management as the key to successful trading; he always decides on an exit point
before he puts on a trade. He also stresses the need for evaluating risk on a portfolio basis rather
than viewing the risk of each trade independently. This is absolutely critical when one holds
positions that are highly correlated, since the overall portfolio risk is likely to be much greater than
the trader realizes.
One statement by Kovner, which made a particularly strong impression on me, concerned his
approach in placing stops: "I place my stop at a point that is too far away or too difficult to reach
easily." In this manner, Kovner maximizes the chances that he will not be stopped out of a trade
that proves correct, while at the same time maintaining rigid money management discipline. The
philosophy behind this approach is that it is better to allocate the predetermined maximum dollar
risk in a trade to a smaller number of contracts, while using a wider stop. This is the exact reverse
of the typical trader, who will try to limit the loss per contract, but trade as many contracts as
possible—an approach which usually results in many good trades being stopped out before the
market moves in the anticipated direction. The moral is: Place your stops at al point that, if reached,
will reasonably indicate that the trade is wrong,' not at a point determined primarily by the
44



==================================================
                     PAGE 45                      
==================================================

maximum dollar amount you are willing to lose per contract. If the meaningful stop point implies
an uncomfortably large loss per contract, trade a smaller number of contracts.
Kovner's worst trading mistake—his "going bust trade," as he terms it—resulted from a spur of the
moment decision. My own personal experience underscores that there is probably no class of trades
with a higher failure rate than impulsive (not to be confused with intuitive) trades. Regardless of
the approach used, once a strategy is selected, the trader should stick to his or her game plan and
avoid impulsive trading decisions (for example, putting on an unplanned trade because a friend has
just recommended it; liquidating a position before the predetermined stop point is reached because
of an adverse price movement).
Finally, Kovner views a good trader as "strong, independent, and contrary in the extreme," and
points to discipline and a willingness to make (and accept) mistakes as significant traits of the
winning trader.

Richard Dennis-A Legend Retires
Richard Dennis became intrigued by commodity trading during the late 1960s, while earning the
minimum wage as a runner on the exchange floor. In the summer of 1970, he decided to take a
crack at trading on his own, and with $1,600 borrowed from his family, he purchased a seat on the
Mid America Exchange.
The Mid Am, as it is called, is a kind of minor league exchange because it trades pint-sized
versions of the contracts traded on the major exchanges. The Mid Am tends to attract the business
of small hedgers and speculators for whom a single regular-sized contract represents too large a
position. As a fledgling trader with little risk capital, the Mid Am was well suited to Dennis—it
was also the only exchange on which he could afford a seat.
The seat cost Dennis $1,200, leaving him a scant $400 for trading. Incredible as it may seem, he
eventually transformed that tiny stake into a fortune, which has been estimated by some to
approach $200 million. As his father is reported to have said, in what must be one of the grand
understatements of all time, "Let's just say Richie ran that four hundred bucks up pretty good."
Although Dennis has been exceptionally successful over the long haul, he has withstood a few
dramatic setbacks. He was in the midst of one such downturn at the time of our interview. Several
of the public funds managed by Dennis lost enough during the late 1987-early 1988 period to
trigger the 50 percent loss cutoff point for the cessation of trading. Dennis' personal account
witnessed a similar fate. As he expressed in a letter to investors, "These results parallel immense
losses in my own personal trading."
Perhaps one of Dennis' most impressive traits as a trader is his ability to weather such hard times
with little emotional impact. Apparently, he has learned to accept such sporadic large losses as part
of the game. His confidence during such periods remains unshaken, as he believes he will
eventually rebound if he stays true to his basic trading strategy. Had I not known, judging by the
mood and confidence of the man I interviewed, I would sooner have guessed that he had just made
a small fortune rather than lost one.
Whatever the stereotype image of a centimillionaire may be, Dennis does not fit it. His low-
spending lifestyle is legendary. In fact, his only real extravagances are his sizable political and
charitable contributions. His political views also do not mesh with the popular image of the very
rich. Dennis is the founder of the Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, a liberal think
tank, and he supports the concept of higher tax rates for wealthy Americans. In recent years, he has
taken an increasingly active role in the political sphere, supporting a variety of liberal candidates.
Unlike trading, his win-loss ratio in politics has been disappointing. In the 1988 presidential race,
Dennis was the national cochairman for the Babbitt campaign.
In drawing up a list of candidates to be interviewed for this project, Dennis was an essential name.
He is one of the foremost trading legends of our time—a trader that a number of others interviewed
in this book cited with the phrase, "I'm not in his league."
In setting up the interview, I dealt with one of Dennis' assistants. After explaining the project to
him, he told me he would talk to Dennis and get back to me. About one week later, I received a call
informing me that Dennis could see me on a date about one month forward for exactly one hour. I
explained that I was coming to Chicago for the primary purpose of interviewing Dennis and that
one hour was hardly enough time to cover all the essential areas. The response essentially was: that
was all the time allotted; the implicit message: Take it or leave it. I agreed, hoping that I would get
some more time if the interview was going well.
I arrived about five minutes before the appointed time and was ushered into a large but decidedly
unpretentious office. Dennis arrived precisely on the hour, shook hands politely, and sat down at
his desk. He apologized in advance if, in the course of the interview, he occasionally glanced at the
quote screen, explaining that he could keep his mind on the interview at the same time, and would
signal me if he had to put in any orders. Having the experience of trading myself (albeit on an in-
fmitesimally smaller scale), I explained that I understood.
As the interview began, there was an element of unease on both our parts. In my case, I had a sense
of a ticking clock with not enough time to accomplish the task at hand. In the case of Dennis, I
believe it was a matter of a genuinely shy personality, at least in terms of a first meeting. After five

==================================================

to ten minutes, the tension was gone, the atmosphere became relaxed, and the conversation flowed
smoothly.
Forty-five minutes into the interview, I began to think that things were going so well that Dennis
would continue our conversation beyond the allotted hour. At exactly ten minutes before the end of
the hour, my illusion was shattered. "I've only got about ten more minutes," he said, "so if there's
still stuff that's important you may want to get to it." I shuffled through my index cards and quickly
tried to identify some of the key questions I had not yet covered. Precisely at the end of the hour,
Dennis said, "That's about all the time I have, thank you."
One segment of questions I did not get to dealt with the political side of Dennis' experiences. These
topics included the Senate hearings on alleged manipulation of the soybean market by Dennis, the
Roosevelt Institute, and the various political figures Dennis had known. Although these subjects
were certainly areas of interest and color, they were not pertinent to the primary focus of this book.
Consequently, I chose questions related to trading before attempting to turn to anything politically
oriented.
At the end of the interview, I played my final card by saying, "I didn't even get to any questions
related to the political side." "They're not interested in that anyway," Dennis replied as he politely
said goodbye and left the office.
About six weeks later, I requested and obtained a follow-up interview with Dennis. The portion of
the interview dealing with the budget deficit problem and Dennis' large losses in his public fund
trading at that time came from this second meeting.
A month after our last conversation, Dennis announced that he was retiring from trading to
concentrate on his political interests full-time. Will Dennis never trade again? Maybe, but don't bet
on it.
How did you first get involved in commodity trading?
After graduating high school, I got a summer job as a runner on the floor and I dabbled in trading a
little bit. With my minimum-wage salary, I was making $40 a week, and losing $40 an hour
trading. I didn't know what I was doing. The advantage was that at least I got to do it with small
amounts of money. I like to say the tuition was small for what I learned.
I heard the story that before you turned twenty-one, you had your father stand in the ring,
while you stood on the sidelines signaling trades to him.
That was in 1968 and 1969. My father had the membership but he didn't know much about trading.
He was just going along with it because I was underage and wanted to do it. When I turned twenty-
one, it was one of the happiest days in his life because he said, "I really hate this. I have no idea
what I'm doing. It's yours!"
Were you at a disadvantage trading one step removed, with your father filling the orders?
Sure. We consistently lost.
But you couldn't have lost very much because you were trading very small.
I probably lost a couple of thousand dollars during that period.
Do you consider that period worthwhile, nonetheless, because of the lessons learned?
Yes, in retrospect, I would say this to new traders—although it may not be a reassuring thought—
when you start, you ought to be as bad a trader as you are ever going to be.
Because it is less expensive at that time?
Right. You shouldn't be too surprised if you really screw up.
Do you know traders for whom early success proved to be their undoing?
I have noticed variations of that. There are a lot of people who get imprinted like ducks. You can
teach them that a warship is their mother if you get them young enough. For a lot of traders, it
doesn't matter so much whether their first big trade is successful or not, but whether their first big
profit is on the long or short side. Those people tend to be perennial bulls or bears, and that is very
bad. Both sides have to be equally OK. There can't be anything psychologically more satisfying
about one than the other. If there is, your trading is going to go askew.
I think that's what happened to a lot of people in the 1973 runaway bull market in soybeans. Even if

                     PAGE 48                      
==================================================

they didn't make money themselves, but were just present to witness the market mania and see a
few people make a lot of money, they were imprinted with it.
You're talking about a subsequent bias to the bullish side because of that experience?
Yes.
What gave you confidence when you first started trading on the Mid America Exchange with
such a small stake? After all, one mistake and you were out of the game.
Well, no, the advantage of the Mid America Exchange was that they traded minicontracts. I had a
few mistakes in me, and I made most, but not all of them. I don't know that I had any confidence. I
just had what a lot of people have when they get in this business: a need to try to succeed. I mean, if
you were betting on this sort of thing before the fact, you should have bet that it wouldn't work.
There is no doubt about that.
Most traders are not successful in the first year. What were you doing differently?
I was doing enough things right that I didn't capsize even with that small capitalization. I was lucky
enough to stagger into having the right positions on before the big corn blight in 1970.
Was that luck or foresight?
I think it was more foresight. I had very pale ideas, rales, and attitudes about the market then. But a
few that I learned were right, like go with the trend.
One Friday, the grain markets all closed at their highs for the year. I believed—and I still believe—
that you go with the trend, and the stronger the trend, the better. I remember getting in on the close
and just buying a couple of minicontracts in corn, wheat, and beans. The next Monday morning
they all opened up the limit because of the corn blight news.
Sure that didn't have to happen, and if it didn't, it would have set me back. It might have taken a lot
longer to get to about $2,000, which compared to $400 was a real grubstake. But, it wasn't like I
threw a dart and decided what to do. I did something that should work in the long ran—I went with
the trend.
Is this particular pattern—a very strong close on a Friday—a market characteristic that you find
useful as an indicator of the following week's price action?
Yes, at a minimum, it is important not to have a short position with a loss on Friday if the market
closes at a high, or a long position if it closes at alow.
I was curious about your going to graduate school despite your initial trading success.
I signed up for graduate school before the summer of 1970, which was when I traded in the pit for
the first time. I had just planned to trade over the summer, but the three months and $3,000 in
profits made a big impression on me. I went to Tulane in New Orleans and lasted for about one
week. I used my laundromat quarters phoning trades into Chicago. Once I used up all the quarters
and had nothing but dirty clothes, I had no choice but to come back to Chicago.
Since then you have been a full-time commodity trader?
Yes.
What comes to mind as your most dramatic or most emotional trading experience?
There was one in the first year. I had just quit graduate school to trade. One day, I made a
particularly bad trade and lost about $300. Since I only had about $3,000, that was a very big loss
and it was destabilizing. I then compounded the error by reversing my original position and losing
again. To top things off, I then reversed back to my original position and lost a third time. By the
end of the day, I had lost $1,000, or one-third of my entire capitalization.
Since then, I have learned that when you have a destabilizing loss, get out, go home, take a nap, do
something, but put a little time between that and your next decision. When you are getting beat to
death, get your head out of the mixer. Looking back, I realized that if I had had a trading rale about
losses, I wouldn't have had that traumatic experience.
In retrospect, would you say that was one of your best trades because you were so imprinted
with that experience that you didn't make a mistake of that magnitude, percentagewise,
again?

==================================================
                     PAGE 49                      
==================================================

Absolutely. I learned to avoid trying to catch up or double up to recoup losses. I also learned that a
certain amount of loss will affect your judgment, so you have to put some time between that loss
and the next trade.
I guess a corollary of that would be: When things aren't going right, don't push, don't press.
Yes. After all is said and done, you have to minimize your losses and try to preserve capital for
those few instances when you can make a lot in a very short period of time. What you can't afford
to do is throw away your capital on suboptimal trades. If you do, you will be too debilitated to trade
when the right position comes along. Even if you put the trade on, it will be relatively small
because your capital will have been depleted by the other trades.
Was the 1973 soybean market your first really big market?
I made enough money in that market to go to the Chicago Board of Trade the next year. I didn't
make my money by just going long soybeans. I was basically a pit trader, who traded in and out a
lot. The markets were very good, because there was excellent order flow. It was a great time to be
in the pit.
So it wasn't so much catching the trend. It was more a matter of scalping the market
successfully.
Also, so many people would make incredibly bad trades just to take a profit. They would get out
even though the market was locked limit-up and almost sure to go up the next day. They couldn't
stand the profits burning a hole in their pocket. I would try to get in when they were getting out.
It sounds like easy pickings.
There was some amount of risk, but if you were disposed to going with a strong trend, it was a deal.
They were giving you an edge to do it.
Giving you a high probability that the next day you would be ahead?
You have to remember some of these markets went up the limit ten days in a row. Most people
thought that even four or five consecutive limit-up days was impossible.
In situations where a market goes limit-up, limit-up, limit-up, at some point, the market may
open limit-down. How do you recognize or sense when not to buy at limit bid?
It's just an odds play. There is a lot of volatility in the outcome, but you know the odds are in your
favor when you go long at limit bid.
In all the years you have traded, have there been any really bad years? Was there a
particular market or two that you were dead wrong about and that caused it to be a bad
year?
When we have had bad trading periods, it is really not one market that does it. In those situations,
almost all the markets are going sideways and making lots of false breakouts. If one of the markets
is decent, that is usually enough to avoid a bad situation.
Is there any year that stands out?
1978 was not a good year for trading. I compounded losses unnecessarily because I was in the
process of making the transition from floor trader to off-the-floor trader and had no idea how
different they were.
Was 1978 the year that you started trading from an office?
In 1977,1 was mostly a floor trader, and by 1978 I had made the full-time transition.
Did that switch cause you to become more of a long-term position trader?
Ultimately, what I learned from 1978 is that you have to be longer term as a desk trader. In the pit,
if it looked like soybeans were going to break 3 cents, I would sell, and if it didn't break, I would
get out. You don't have that luxury off the floor, because you lose the edge when putting in the
orders. Also, the judgments you make looking at prices on the screen aren't as good as those made
in the pit watching what is going on. In the pit, there are indicators that you learn subconsciously,
like "these three guys are never right at market turns," and if they all do the same thing at the same
time, a light clicks on. It took me a long time to realize that those tools weren't going to be
available anymore.

==================================================

Why did you make the change? You were doing really well on the floor. Why switch to a
desk?
When I started in 1970, there were no futures markets in currencies, interest rates, or gold. By
1978, these markets had been listed on the board long enough to be viable. The currencies started in
1974, but it took several years to get enough volume.
So, it was the desire to trade more markets than you physically could in a single location that
motivated your move?
And the opportunity didn't exist five years earlier.
I understand that you initiated a trader-trainee program. What year was that?
We hired a group at the beginning of 1984 and another group at the beginning of 1985.
What was the motivation for this program?
I have a partner who has been a friend since high school. We have had philosophical disagreements
about everything you could imagine. One of these arguments was whether the skills of a successful
trader could be reduced to a set of rules—that was my point of view—or whether there was
something ineffable, mystical, subjective, or intuitive that made someone a good trader. This
argument had been going on for a long time, and I guess I was getting a little frustrated with idle
speculation. Finally, I said, "Here is a way we can definitely resolve this argument. Let's hire and
train some people and see what happens." He agreed.
It was an intellectual experiment. We trained them as well as we could. That was the way to do the
experiment right, I thought. I tried to codify all the things I knew about the markets. We taught
them a little bit about probability, money management, and trading. It turned out I was right. I don't
say that to pat myself on the back, but even I am surprised how well it worked. It's frightening how
well it worked.
Is your basic contention that you can take almost any reasonably intelligent individual and
turn him into a successful trader?
No. We screened for people we thought would be right. We received 1,000 applications and
narrowed it down to forty people whom we interviewed. Then we picked ten.
What qualities were you looking for?
I don't like to discuss that because if I told you one of the things we looked for was chess players,
and we ever do it again, we would be inundated by resumes from chess players.
Was intelligence one of the key items?
It was one of the traits, but it wasn't the essential item. To find the things that we were looking for,
we could choose from intelligent or extremely intelligent people. We picked the ones with extreme
intelligence just because they were available.
Didn't you have any reluctance about giving away trade secrets?
Sure, but I don't think trading strategies are as vulnerable to not working if people know about
them, as most traders believe. If what you are doing is right, it will work even if people have a
general idea about it. I always say that you could publish trading rules in the newspaper and no one
would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline. Almost anybody can make up a list of
rules that are 80 percent as good as what we taught our people. What they couldn't do is give them
the confidence to stick to those rales even when things are going bad.
How long was the training process?
Shockingly short. In the first year, it took two weeks. Then we had them trade for a month and keep
a log indicating why they made their trades. We wanted to see if they were consistent in doing what
they had been taught. We really got good at it in the second year—the course took just one week.
How many trainees were there?
Twenty-three in total.
What were the results?
We dropped three people who didn't do well. The other twenty, however, have averaged about 100
percent profit per year.

                     PAGE 51                      
==================================================

When you train people, you tell them your basic approach to the markets. Isn't there a risk of
creating twenty clones of Richard Dennis? Wouldn't their trading results be highly correlated
with what you are doing?
There was a huge spread. One of the things that we repeatedly told the class was: "We are going to
teach you what we think works, but you are expected to add your own personal flair, feeling, or
judgment."
How large are the stakes these traders are using?
It has increased over the years as they have made money. I would say on average about $2 million
each.
What did they start out with?
One hundred thousand dollars each.
I've heard this group of traders referred to as the "turtles." I found that term somewhat
amusing. What is the origin of the name?
When I decided to do the trader-trainee program, I had just returned from a trip to the Far East. In
telling someone about the program I said, "We are going to grow traders just like they grow turtles
in Singapore." I had visited a farm there and seen a huge vat with thousands of squirming turtles;
that became my image of growing traders.
How much of a role does luck play in trading?
In the long run, zero. Absolutely zero. I don't think anybody winds up making money in this
business because they started out lucky.
But on individual trades, obviously, it makes a difference?
That is where the confusion lies. On any individual trade it is almost all luck. It is just a matter of
statistics. If you take something that has a 53 percent chance of working each time, over the long
run there is a 100 percent chance of it working. If I review the results of two different traders,
looking at anything less than one year doesn't make any sense. It might be a couple of years before
you can determine if one is better than the other.
You are one of the few people who is both a discretionary trader and a systems trader. How
would you compare the two approaches?
Professional traders may do some very intelligent things, but they have a tendency not to think
systematically about what they are doing. For example, most traders who do a trade that works will
not think: Why did it work? What did I do here that I might be able to do in another market, at
another time? There is not a lot of reflection on the process of trading, hi contrast, I think I always
have been analytical about trading, even before I ever researched a mechanical system.
On the opposite extreme, you have the academic types who research before they have ever traded.
They lack the seat-of-the-pants knowledge necessary to develop good trading systems. Mercifully, I
did the trading first. Therefore, the research we do is more applicable to the real world.
Can you give me an example of how the lack of real world experience would hurt the
researcher?
As an example, assume I develop a mechanical system that often signals placement of stops at
points where I know there will tend to be a lot of stops, hi the real world, it is not too wise to have
your stop where everyone else has their stop. Also, that system is going to have above-average
skids. If you don't understand that and adjust the results accordingly, you are going to get a system
that looks great on paper, but is going to do consistently poorer in the real world.
You mentioned that before you developed a mechanical trading system, you paid close
attention to the trading process. Did you keep a log of what you did right and wrong, or was it
a matter of memory?
Yes, I would write down observations and think about them. I thought about everything I was
doing.
Is that something you would advise other traders to do to improve— that is, keep track of
what they are doing right and what they are doing wrong?

==================================================
                     PAGE 52                      
==================================================

Sure. The trading experience is so intense that there is a natural tendency to want to avoid thinking
about it once the day is over. I am that way when things are working. But, when they are not, it
spurs me to want to think about what I'm doing and how I might do better. When things go bad,
traders shouldn't stick their heads in the sand and just hope it gets better.
What you are saying is that the times when it is most tempting to avoid thinking about the
markets at all are the times when you should be thinking about them the most.
Right. I don't have any problem with that because I am obsessive about the markets.
What do you do in a situation where your feelings as a trader tell you to do one thing and
your systems point in the other direction?
If they are absolutely opposed, you do nothing until you can resolve that conflict.
Are most of your systems trend oriented in nature?
Yes.
So, by definition, they will never be in the right direction at market turns. Yet you, as an
experienced trader, may sense when a market may be prone for a turn. In a situation like
that, would you be willing to buy because of what you see as a trader even though your
system is short?
I would probably want to be flat, since I tend to weigh the psychological, opinion-oriented segment
of trading about equal with the technical and trend-following element.
So you want to see the market display some signs of turning around before you'll commit?
What is more likely is that I will be positioned in the right direction of a trend and decide to
liquidate faster than a trend-following system would because of the intuitive factor.
What about entering a new trade counter to a prevailing trend?
I've certainly done it—that is, made countertrend initiations. However, as a rule of thumb, I don't
think you should do it.
Do those type of trades do more poorly than other trades?
Generally, yes, although every now and then they may give you a great story like going short sugar
at 60 cents, which I did. [Sugar plummeted from a high of 66 cents in November 1974 to a relative
low under 12 cents only seven months later. Each 1 -cent move in sugar is worth $ 1,120 per
contract. A large trader like Dennis will often trade positions measured in thousands of contracts.]
I've got ten stories like that. But I have to tell you, in all honesty, I don't think the broad class of
trades I have done like that have been profitable.
The short sugar trade is a great example because the market had witnessed an incredibly
explosive upmove and it took a lot of courage to step in as a seller at 60 cents. But take the flip
side when sugar is in a real bear market and is down to 5 cents; every trend-following system
in the world is going to be short. Yet, if conditions are such that the fundamentals are in
transition and the market price is only a little over the cost of the bag it's packed in, would
you make an exception?
Actually, I've lost more money in situations like that because all the market has to do is go down
one more cent and you are out of there. I made a lot of money going short sugar at 60 cents, but I
lost much more going long sugar at 6 cents.
When you do a trade like that, that is, buying a market because the downside is so-called
"limited," do you just ride it out, or do you eventually throw in the towel?
You throw it in. Because how do you know? Maybe it is going to 2 cents; maybe it is going to 1
cent.
I guess a main concern is that you are constantly giving up the premium in the forward
months. [In a bear market, the more forward contracts tend to trade at a premium. For
example, May sugar might be at 6 cents, July at 6\ and October at 7. Even if cash prices
remained stable, a holder of October futures would lose 1 cent between May and October.]
Sure, you are forced out at 3 and get back in at 5. Then it falls to 3 again.
52



==================================================
                     PAGE 53                      
==================================================

Otherwise, there wouldn't be that much risk in the trade.
Right. The idea that one side of the market is much more likely to work in the absence of anything
else is an illusion. The market just wouldn't be there if that was true. There were plenty of guys
who went short soybeans at $4 in 1973, because just like sugar at 4 cents couldn't go any lower,
beans at $4 couldn't go any higher. Well, not only did they go higher, they went to a high of $12.97
in a matter of four or five months. There is another point that I think is as important: You should
expect the unexpected in this business; expect the extreme. Don't think in terms of boundaries that
limit what the market might do. If mere is any lesson I have learned in the nearly twenty years that
I've been in this business, it is that the unexpected and the impossible happen every now and then.
So don't be too tied to history?
Right.
And yet, all your rules are based on history. Is there a contradiction there?
No, because a good trend-following system will keep you in the market until there is evidence that
the trend has changed. If you had been doing your historical research on soybeans in 1972, you
would have concluded that any time soybeans advance by 50 cents, you might as well get out,
because the market had never moved up or down by significantly more than that. Obviously, that
was the wrong conclusion because it went up another $8. A good trend-following system, however,
would have kept you in for most of the move.
So you don't want to draw boundaries from history over market behavior?
Right. The correct approach is to say: This structure means up, and this structure means up no
more, but never that this structure means up this much and no more.
When you trade a system, do you go with the version of the system that tested out best for the
past, or do other factors command consideration?
One of the toughest problems in deciding how to trade is whether you just go with what is optimal
for the data base, or whether you start from some other premise. You might deliberately trade
something other than the optimal parameter set [version of the system with the best past per-
formance] because you think the future is going to be unlike the past in a specific way. By
definition, any other parameter set is going to have a poorer past performance than the optimal set.
But if the difference in performance is only 10 percent, it might well be worth that 10 percent
difference if you believe the suboptimal set, as measured by past data, will fit the future better.
You have gone from being a very small trader to a very large trader, especially now that you
are managing outside money. Do you find that order size gets in the way? Does it become
substantially more difficult to be successful when you are trading size?
At some level it would. I don't think we have reached that point yet, although we may not be
tremendously far away from it. I think about three times the amount we are handling now would be
just about it. We currently have about $120 million in customer funds.
In other words, you haven't hit the wall yet?
No.
Is that because you are using many different approaches and, therefore, don't have all your
orders going in at one point?
Yes. You have to think about diversification. If you had one method, or one person, making all the
decisions, you couldn't handle amounts that large. But if you use different strategies and have a
diversity in decision makers, you can handle several hundred million dollars without any major
problem.
Could that have been a subliminal reason for developing your training program—to try to
diversify the decision-making process?
Actually, we hadn't thought of it that way, but it did work to our advantage. In fact, we are going to
try to market some of the traders we have trained for trading customer money.
Is slippage a problem in your trading? [Slippage is the difference between the theoretical
execution price assumed by a computer program and the actual fill price.]

                     PAGE 54                      
==================================================

No. We try to make a hard-nosed estimate when building the cost of trading into a system. Also, we
reduce our costs significantly by having our own brokers.
When you hold a major position, at what point do you know you are wrong? What tells you
to get out of the position?
If you have a loss on a trade after a week or two, you are clearly wrong. Even when you are around
breakeven, but a significant amount of time has passed, you are probably wrong mere too.
Do you define your maximum risk point when you get into a trade?
You should always have a worst case point. The only choice should be to get out quicker.
Are you largely a self-taught trader, or did other traders teach you lessons that were
worthwhile?
I would say I am self-taught. What is really amazing is how little published literature there is on
trading.
Is there anything you can recommend to people who are interested in trading?
I think Edwin Lefevre's Reminiscences of a Stock Operator [reputedly a semifictionalized
biography of Jesse Livermore, the legendary stock trader] is interesting and captures the feel of
trading pretty well, but that book was written sixty-five years ago.
Are there some key trading strategies that you can talk about without revealing any secrets?
The market being in a trend is the main thing that eventually gets us in a trade. That is a pretty
simple idea. Being consistent and making sure you do that all the time is probably more important
than the particular characteristics you use to define the trend. Whatever method you use to enter
trades, the most critical thing is that if there is a major trend, your approach should assure that you
get in that trend.
A trend could easily be defined using a simple system. Is there something special that you
look for to define a trend?
No. If I see a trend developing, I know eventually I'll have to get in. The question is whether I get
in earlier or later, and that might depend on how I see the market reacting to news. If a market goes
up when it should go up, I might buy earlier. If it goes down when it should go up, I'll wait until the
trend is better defined.
How much common behavior is there between markets? Are the patterns of beans similar to
the patterns of bonds, or do markets have their own personalities?
I could trade without knowing the name of the market.
So, what you are saying is that patterns in different markets are very similar.
Yes. In our research, if a system doesn't work for both bonds and beans, we don't care about it.
Would you say the stock market is an exception? That is, does the stock market also behave
like other markets, or does the stock market have its own behavior pattern?
I think it is probably separate.
Why would you say that is true?
Well, my research on individual stocks shows that price fluctuations are closer to random than they
are in commodities. Demonstrably, commodities are trending and, arguably, stocks are random.
Do you have an explanation for that phenomenon?
I believe that there is not enough fundamental information per stock to create sufficient trends to
move them from their random character. There aren't as many commodities as there are stocks.
In other words, there is not the same flow of information as in the commodity markets?
There is not enough information, not enough fundamentals. Just nothing going on.
In the commodity markets, technical information is basically confined to price, volume, and
open interest. Since there is so much more technical information available for stock indexes—
advance/decline ratios, various sentiment indicators, relationships between different groups
of stocks, etc.—do ordinary trend-following systems start off at a big disadvantage because
54



==================================================
                     PAGE 55                      
==================================================

they don't use enough information?
I'm not sure that is the disadvantage. I think the disadvantage is that stock index prices are too close
to random to develop enough clear-cut trends because the inputs—the individual stocks—are
mostly random.
What are your thoughts on the recent attacks against program trading?
The people that are complaining ought to be ashamed of themselves.
Do you mean people in the financial community?
Yes. They should have enough sophistication to understand the inanity of what they are
complaining about.
Do you see program trading as a convenient scapegoat for a declining market?
Sure. It is a good excuse for doing a lousy job for yourself and your clients. The claim is that
program traders are taking money out of the pockets of the people who are investing in the stock
market. Nothing could be further from the truth. Program trading may move the stock market
around a bit, but not in any systematic way. If program trading caused prices to go too high or too
low, that should provide better opportunities for the value investor. Of course, it's bad for those
people who pretend they are value investors, but are really traders.
How do you handle a losing streak?
Cut back. If it is really bad, stop and get out.
Do you sometimes need to get away from the markets for a few days?
Generally, it just takes a day or two, but you do need to stop for a period of time. It is almost like a
pitcher not balking. Before he throws the ball, he has to stop at least for that second. That is what I
try to do—at least have a pause. It could be for just one day.
What is the biggest public fallacy about market behavior?
That markets are supposed to make sense.
How about fallacies regarding technical analysis?
The belief that technical factors are not as important as the fundamentals.
Are there any analysts whose work you respect?
There are a lot of them/Zweig) for example, is good.
Would you consider the work of outside analysts as an input in a trade?
No. When we taught our people to trade, I had a hypothetical question: Suppose everything you
know about the markets indicates a "buy." Then you call the floor and they tell you that I'm selling.
Do you: (a) buy, (b) go short, (c) do nothing? If they didn't eventually understand that (a) was
correct because they have to make their own market decisions, then they didn't fit into the program.
Why do you handle other people's money? You are doing very well on your own.
Well, there is one big advantage: managed money offers potential return with no risk. For ten years,
people have been asking me if I'm getting tired of all the risk. Do I think I'm going to bum out? Do
I think I'm going to stop? For the longest time I didn't understand what they were talking about. But
I have to admit, at this point, I understand the value of cutting down your own risk. I could have
traded smaller and had a smaller profit and smaller risk. But if customer money comes in, I could
use that to supplement the profitability and still keep my risk lower. It just gives you a better deal.
In a later interview, Dennis changed his mind on this subject, possibly influenced by the
aggravation related to large losses in his public funds. Dennis decided to extricate himself gradually
from the money management business, saying: "I found that it was more trouble than it was worth.
The costs were not financial; they were psychological." The material that follows is from that
second interview.
I know this is not going to be your favorite subject, but I've got to ask you about it. Some of
the public funds you managed ceased trading in April 1988. Is that because they reached the
automatic 50 percent loss cutoff point?
Actually, they were down just under 49 percent when we stopped trading. Rather than trigger the
55



==================================================
                     PAGE 56                      
==================================================

automatic termination point, we liquidated all positions and resolicited the investors to allow a
lower cutoff point.
Would you do anything differently in the future because of this particular experience?
I would cut back a little faster than I did, but the trades would still be the same. Someone said to
me, "You claim the markets were bad. Well, since you could have done the exact opposite and
made a lot of money, weren't they really good?" I told him that the last thing I would have wanted
to do was to be on the opposite side of those trades. In the long ran, that is a way to lose an infinite
amount of money.
The short side of the interest rate markets in October 1987 resulted in one of your worst
losses. What went wrong there?
A large part of that loss was due to the fact that the market gapped way past our point for covering
our short position. For example, on October 20, we would normally have been out of our short
Eurodollar position about 40 to 50 points higher, but the market opened 240 points higher that day.
We blew 190 points in a skid that was absolutely unavoidable.
If the market is that much out of line, do you still get out of your position right away?
Sure. If you have any doubt about getting out as fast as possible in a situation like that, then you are
really in big trouble.
Do you think the sharp losses you suffered were due to any change in the markets?
That's hard to say. The only factor I can objectively identify is the tendency toward more false
breakouts.
Do you feel the recent prevalence of false breakouts is related to the tremendous increase in
computerized trend-following trading during the past five to ten years? Are there just too
many people doing the same thing, getting in each other's way?
Yes, there is no doubt about it. In a perverse sort of way, it represents the ultimate triumph of
technical trading over fundamental trading. I say perverse because it is a victory that devalues
technical trading.
Do you think we may see the day when trend-following systems no longer work?
There will come a day when easily discovered and lightly conceived trend-following systems no
longer work. It is going to be harder to develop good systems.
Given that, can the approaches you were using before still work with the same efficacy?
Actually, I believe that if you view the problem correctly, you can make the fact that there are
many other trend followers in the market work to your advantage. I can't get too specific about the
solution, because if we are right, that is pretty valuable information. To be successful you always
have to be one step ahead of everyone else.
It sounds like you started working on this problem well before your performance problems
began in late 1987.
That's right. During the past ten years, there has been a virtual bandwagon-effect of people using
trend-following approaches. We have been thinking about this problem for a long time. Half the
work in solving a problem is finding the right way to conceptualize it. It took us years before we
figured out the right questions to ask.
When did you finally arrive at what you considered a satisfactory solution?
Ironically, right around the time we closed down the public funds.
I know you can't be specific, but does your solution to false breakouts involve being far more
short-term oriented, so that you can respond more quickly to those situations?
The secret is being as short term or as long term as you can stand, depending on your trading style.
It is the intermediate term that picks up the vast majority of trend followers. The best strategy is to
avoid the middle like the plague.
When you talk about the experience of managing well over $100 million and losing roughly 50
percent, not to mention your personal large losses, you discuss it with great emotional
56



==================================================
                     PAGE 57                      
==================================================

detachment. Do you really take it that calmly? Isn't there an emotional side to it?
I try for there not to be. It is totally counterproductive to get wrapped up in the results. Trading
decisions should be made as unemotionally as possible.
Yes, but how do you do that?
You have to maintain your perspective. There is more to life than trading. Also, to me, being
emotionally deflated would mean lacking confidence in what I am doing. I avoid that because I
have always felt that it is misleading to focus on short-term results.
So you are able to avoid the emotional trap?
Yes, but the flip side is that I also avoid the emotional elation when things are going well. There is
no way to play just one side of that street. If you feel too good when things are going well, then
inevitably you will feel too bad when they are going poorly. I wouldn't claim that I realized that
after three years of trading, but after you've done it for twenty years, it either drives you crazy, or
you learn to put it into perspective.
Does it become easier after twenty years?
Not necessarily [he laughs]. It gets easier to put it into perspective, but everyone has shock
absorbers that deteriorate over time. Being a trader is like being a boxer: Every now and then, the
market gives you a good wallop. After twenty years you get a bit punch-drunk.
Is there any advice you can give to other traders on how to stay emotionally calm during
periods of trading losses?
It is a little bit like playing golf: You can throw your clubs around after making a bad shot, but
while you are making the next shot you should keep your head down and your eye on the ball.
Do you use long-term scenarios about economic growth, inflation, and the dollar in making
your trading decisions?
I have mental pictures, but I try not to use them when I'm trading. Trading to me is like betting on
independent roles of the dice that you think are loaded a little bit in your favor, because you know
some statistical things about the market. Long-term scenarios can prove to be right or wrong, but
even if they are right, on balance, I'm not convinced that they make much difference over the term
of any individual trade.
Even if you think the dollar is going to collapse, that doesn't affect your basic trading
pattern?
I would like to say it doesn't, and I don't think it should, but it probably has in the past. The worst
thing you can do is miss a profit opportunity (assuming you are already disciplined enough to cut
your losses short). And if you think about it, rigid long-term views are the kind of thing most likely
to lead you to that mistake. For example, if I believe the dollar is going to weaken, and because of
this I ignore a sell signal in the foreign currencies, I might risk missing a large profit. What is my
reward if my view was right? Avoiding a small loss. Therefore, the risk/reward is all wrong for my
type of trading.
Acknowledging that caveat, as a long-time market observer, what major trends do you see
shaping up over the coming years?
I bet we will be at record levels of inflation by the end of 1990. [This interview was conducted in
mid-1988.]
What is going to be the driving force behind that inflation?
It is going to be driven by trying to avoid a deep recession. The recession is going to be caused by
the federal budget deficit as investors require higher and higher levels of real interest rates to buy
the debt. The' government will try to avoid the recession by stimulating the economy, a tactic
which essentially doesn't work.
In other words, fear of a recession will cause tremendous monetary easing, which in turn will
lead to inflation?
It is, unfortunately, a very Republican idea, but I think it is right. Whether you like it or not, the
financial markets are in conservative hands. People who lend money to the government and
57



==================================================
                     PAGE 58                      
==================================================

business will not buy monetary easing as a solution to a recession.
Are you implying that the deficit problem is just a time bomb, which will eventually shatter
the economy?
Sure. We tend to think that since it is not a problem now, that means it won't be. We expect
continuity in our lives, but the economy, and certainly the markets, are more discontinuous than
continuous.
And you are saying that people look at the deficit year after year and think, "Well, it can't be
so bad, the economy is strong," and one day everybody wakes up—
It is like having termites in the foundation of your house. You may not notice them until one day
they gnaw away a big chunk and the house collapses. I don't think anybody should take a large
amount of comfort in the fact that things appear to be holding together.
Hypothetically, if you were President and could influence change, would the deficit be the
first thing you would change?
Sure. I think it is especially important for Democrats, since they were the first ones to pick up the
banner of Keynesianism [the advocacy of government programs to increase employment], to admit
that while it may be a great theory, it doesn't work in the real world.
I don't think Keynes ever proposed using deficit spending in strong economic times.
No, that's true. He proposed surpluses that were supposed to be countercyclical to deficits.
Surpluses in good times; deficits in bad times. The trouble is that we have only one side of that
equation because of the lack of political will to create the surpluses when times are good. So what
we really ought to do is admit that Keynesian economics is just an excuse for easy money,
overspending, and overconsuming. We ought to just admit that the government is a debt junkie and
the whole concept of deficit spending is flawed in practice.
You mean Keynesianism as it is being applied, not Keynesian economics as he himself
purported it?
The theory is fine, it just doesn't work in the real world. Therefore, we shouldn't use it. Besides,
Keynesian economics was a solution to the problem of oversaving and underconsumption, which
was a fair enough attempt to pull us out of the Great Depression. The problem now is the exact
opposite: undersaving and overconsumption. Even if Keynesianism were politically tenable, you
still need a different solution because you have the exact opposite problem.
Is there an economic theory that you feel fits the times and makes sense?
We have to get rid of deficit spending. We need to retire the deficit in some orderly way, and the
federal government should have to balance its budget just as the states do. At that point, Milton
Friedman's proposal for a constant money supply adjusted by a growth factor would probably be a
good idea.
What is the most important advice you could give the novice trader?
Trade small because that's when you are as bad as you are ever going to be. Learn from your
mistakes. Don't be misled by the day-to-day fluctuations in your equity. Focus on whether what you
are doing is right, not on the random nature of any single trade's outcome.
After Dennis announced his retirement from trading to pursue his political interests full time, I
called with some follow-up questions. I spoke to an aide who took down the questions. Several
days later, he called back with Dennis' replies. These questions and answers follow.
Individuals who invested in your funds during your final year as a money manager fared
poorly. How would an investor have done if he started on your first day as a money manager
and kept his money fully invested until your last day in that role?
Each $1,000 invested would have been worth $3,833 when the accounts were closed. [This works
out to approximately a 25 percent annual compounded return. The figure would have been more
than double that at the equity peak about one year earlier.]
You are rumored to have lost a very substantial portion of your own net worth during your
final year of trading. Are these stories true or exaggerated?
58



==================================================
                     PAGE 59                      
==================================================

I lost about 10 percent of the money I had made in the markets. Of course, measured as a
percentage of my net worth, the figure is much higher because of my charitable and political
contributions over the years.
Did your poor trading results during the past year speed your career transitions?
It made no difference.
Have you really gone cold turkey, or are you still trading lightly?
I am not trading at all.
Richard Dennis is one of the legendary commodity traders of our time. He is the type of trader you
might visualize implementing large long positions near market bottoms and large short positions
near market tops. It is thus surprising that Dennis downplays the value of trying to pick major
turning points. In fact, he claims that such trades have done little, if anything, to contribute to his
trading success.
Dennis believes that one of the worst mistakes a trader can make is to miss a major profit
opportunity. According to his own estimate, 95 percent of his profits have come from only 5
percent of his trades. Missing only a few such profit opportunities could have a dramatic negative
impact on performance. As a corollary, you need to guard against holding too rigid an opinion on a
market, since such an opinion could easily lead to missing a major trend.
One particularly useful piece of advice offered by Dennis is that the times when you least want to
think about trading—the losing periods—are precisely the times when you need to focus most on
trading.

==================================================

Paul Tudor Jones-The Art of Aggressive Trading
October 1987 was a devastating month for most investors as the world stock markets witnessed a
collapse that rivaled 1929. That same month, the Tudor Futures Fund, managed by Paul Tudor
Jones, registered an incredible 62 percent return. Jones has always been a maverick trader. His
trading style is unique and his performance is uncorrelated with other money managers. Perhaps
most important, he has done what many thought impossible: combine five consecutive, triple-digit
return years with very low equity retracements. (I am fudging slightly; in 1986, Paul's fund realized
only a 99.2 percent gain!)
Jones has succeeded in every major venture he has tried. He started out in the business as a broker
and in his second year grossed over $1 million in commissions. In fall 1980, Jones went to the New
York Cotton Exchange as an independent floor trader. Again he was spectacularly successful,
making millions during the next few years. His really impressive achievement though was not the
magnitude of his winnings, but the consistency of his performance: During his three and a half
years as a floor trader, he witnessed only one losing month.
In 1984, partially out of boredom, and partially out of fear of eventually losing his voice—an
occupational hazard for a pit trader— Jones again abandoned his successful career for a new
venture: money management. He launched the Tudor Futures Fund in September 1984 with $1.5
million under management. At the end of October 1988, each $1,000 invested in this fund was
worth $17,482, while the total amount of money he managed had grown to $330 million. In fact,
the amount under management would have been higher, but Jones stopped accepting new
investment funds in October 1987 and has also made cash disbursements since that time.
If one believes in cycles—as Jones does—it appears that he is due for another career change. It is
hard to imagine what he can do for an encore.
Jones is a compendium of contrasts. In private conversation he is relaxed, but as a trader he shouts
his orders with the ferocity of a drill sergeant. His public image is one of a swaggering, egotistical
trader, but one-on-one he is easygoing and unassuming. The media usually dramatizes the
flamboyant elements of his lifestyle—Chesapeake Bay Mansion, private 3,000-acre wildlife
preserve, beautiful women, fine restaurants—but he has also made helping the poor a second
avocation.
Jones has emulated New York businessman Eugene Lang by setting up a fund to finance the
college education of eighty-five elementary school graduates in Brooklyn's economically depressed
Bedford-Stuyvesant section. This is not merely a matter of donating money; Jones has become
personally involved by meeting with his adopted students weekly. More recently, he started the
Robin Hood Foundation, whose endowment has grown to $5 million. This organization, true to its
name, raises money from the rich and distributes it to private groups and individuals working to aid
the poor.
Jones had arranged our interview for 3:15 P.M., a time by which all the futures markets are closed,
except for the stock indexes. Even with only one market trading, I was a little concerned about the
practicality of starting the interview at that time, since I knew that the S&P stock index futures
contract was one of Jones' primary trading vehicles. In fact, when I arrived he was in the midst of
trading the S&P.
I waited until he finished shouting orders over the speakerphone and explained that I did not want
to interrupt his trading. "Maybe we should delay the interview until the market closes," I suggested.
"No problem," he answered, "let's go."
As it turned out, Jones was not merely trading the S&P that afternoon, he was building up a major
position in anticipation of a huge break in the stock market. There is an intensity in Jones'
placement of an order that is reminiscent of a tennis player aggressively returning a volley. ("Buy
300 at even! Go, go, go! Are we in? Speak to me!") Yet, he shifted easily between trading and our
conversation.
Jones speaks with admiration about his first tutor in the business, the legendary cotton trader, Eli
Tullis. Perhaps the one trait of Tullis that made the greatest impression on Jones was his steel-hard
emotional control. He recalls how Tullis could carry on a polite, relaxed conversation with visitors,
without blinking an eye, at the same time his positions were getting decimated in the market.
60



==================================================
                     PAGE 61                      
==================================================

Jones' casualness in seeing visitors, talking to his staff, and participating in this interview at the
same time he was trading a heavy S&P position reflected the same trait. A rally in stock index
futures in the closing minutes of trading that day caused over a $ 1 million loss in Jones' position.
Yet, he was so composed that I didn't realize the market had moved against him until I checked the
closing prices later that day.
There was insufficient time to complete the interview at our first meeting. I returned about two
weeks later. Two things were notable about this second meeting. First, whereas he had been
strongly bearish and heavily short the stock market at the time of our first conversation, Jones'
short-term opinion on the stock market had shifted to bullish in the interim. The failure of the stock
market to follow through on the downside at the price and time he had anticipated convinced him
that the market was headed higher for the short term.
"This market is sold out," he emphasized at our second meeting. This 180-degree shift in opinion
within a short time span exemplified the extreme flexibility that underlies Jones' trading success.
He not only quickly abandoned his original position, but was willing to join the other side once the
evidence indicated his initial projection was wrong. (Yes, his change of heart proved well timed.)
Second, Jones had suddenly adopted a very cautious tone regarding projections p Ttaining to the
stock market and the economy. He was concerned that a second major selling wave in the stock
market—the first being October 1987—could lead to a type of financial Mc-Carthyism. Indeed,
there is historical precedence for such concern: During the Senate hearings held in the 1930s,
committee members were so desperate to find villains responsible for the 1929 stock crash that they
dragged up New York Stock Exchange officials who had held long positions during the price
collapse.
Jones feared that, as a prominent speculator and forecaster of economic trends, he might make a
convenient target for any future governmental witch-hunts. Jones had been particularly rattled by a
call from a prominent government official regarding his trading. "You wouldn't believe how high-
placed this person was," he explained to me in a voice tinged with incredulity, taking particular
care not to divulge anything specific.
Although Jones remained friendly, the directness of the first interview was replaced by an almost
prerecorded quality in his replies. For example, a question about trading strategy was met with a
response about frmit-running^-an illegal practice in which a broker places his own order
m^ront~oralarge customer order. This reply virtually bordered on the absurd since Jones handles no
customer orders. It made as much sense as a football fan, who bets in his office pool, denying that
he took a bribe to throw the game. It sounded as if Jones was using the interview as a forum for
making an official statement, perhaps to be used as evidence in some hypothetical future
congressional hearing. I thought that Jones was being overly cautious—if not paranoid—but then
again, the expectation that a true economic crisis would lead to "killing the messengers of bad
news" does not really seem that far-fetched.
When did you first get interested in trading?
When I was in college I read an article on Richard Dennis, which made a big impression on me. I
thought that Dennis had the greatest job in the world. I already had an appreciation for trading
because my uncle, Billy Dunavant, was a very successful cotton trader. In 1976, after I finished
college, I went to my uncle and asked him if he could help me get started as a trader. He sent me to
Eli Tullis, a famous cotton trader, who lived in New Orleans. "Eli is the best trader I know," he told
me. I went down to see Eli and he offered me a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange.
How come you went to work for Eli instead of your uncle?
Because my uncle was primarily involved in the cash side of the business, merchandising cotton. I
was interested in becoming a trader straightaway.
How long did you work on the floor of the exchange? What was your job there?
I was a floor clerk; that is how everybody begins. But I also did a lot of analytical work, watching
the market to try to figure out what made it tick. I clerked in New York for about six months and
then returned to New Orleans to work for Eli.
Did you learn a lot about trading from Eli?
61



==================================================
                     PAGE 62                      
==================================================

Absolutely. Working with Eli was a fabulous experience. He would trade position sizes of 3,000
contracts when the entire market open interest was only 30,000. He would trade more volume than
any cotton trader off the floor. He was a true sight to behold.
Was he trading futures against cash or just speculating?
He was a pure speculator. The amazing thing was that since he used his own broker on the floor,
everyone always knew exactly what his position was. He was very easy to tag. Eli's attitude was,
"The hell with it, I'm going to take them head on."
So everyone knew his hand?
Definitely.
But, apparently, it didn't hurt him?
No.
Is that an exception? Do you try to hide your positions?
I try. But, realistically, the guys in the pit who have been there for five or ten years know it is me.
Everyone knows when I trade. The one thing I learned from Eli is that, ultimately, the market is
going to go where it is going to go.
So you don't think it is important to hide your positions?
I think it is important to make an effort. For instance, my orders used to be particularly easy to read
because I traded in multiples of 300 contracts. Now I break my orders up; I might give one broker
an order for 116 and another broker an order for 184.1 have at least four brokers in every pit.
What else did you learn from Tullis?
He was the toughest son of a bitch I ever knew. He taught me that trading is very competitive and
you have to be able to handle getting your butt kicked. No matter how you cut it, there are
enormous emotional ups and downs involved.
That sounds like a general character-building lesson. What about specifics regarding
trading?
Tullis taught me about moving volume. When you are trading size, you have to get out when the
market lets you out, not when you want to get out. He taught me that if you want to move a large
position, you don't wait until the market is in new high or low ground because very little volume
may trade there if it is a turning point.
One thing I learned as a floor trader was that if, for example, the old high was at 56.80, there are
probably going to be a lot of buy stops at 56.85. If the market is trading 70 aid, 75 offered, the
whole trading ring has a vested interest in buying the market, touching off those stops, and
liquidating into the stops—that is a very common ring practice. As an upstairs trader, I put that
together with what Eli taught me. If I want to cover a position in that type of situation, I will
liquidate half at 75, so that I won't have to worry about getting out of the entire position at the point
where the stops are being hit. I will always liquidate half my position below new highs or lows and
the remaining half beyond that point.
Any other lessons you can attribute to Tullis?
By watching Eli, I learned that even though markets look their very best when they are setting new
highs, that is often the best time to sell. He instilled in me the idea that, to some extent, to be a good
trader, you have to be a contrarian.
You have done tens of thousands of trades. Is there any single trade that stands out?
Yes, the 1979 cotton market. One leams the most from mistakes, not successes. I was a broker back
then. We had lots of speculative accounts and I was long about 400 contracts of July cotton. The
market had been trading in a range between 82 and 86 cents, and I was buying it every time it came
down to the low end of that range.
One day, the market broke to new lows, took out the stops, and immediately rebounded about 30 or
40 points. I thought the reason the market had been acting so poorly was because of the price
vulnerability implied by the proximity of those well-known stops. Now that the stops had been
touched off, I thought the market was ready to rally.

==================================================
                     PAGE 63                      
==================================================

I was standing outside the ring at the time. In an act of bravado, I told my floor broker to bid 82.90
for 100 July, which at the time was a very big order. He bid 90 for 100, and I remember the Refco
broker came running across the pit screaming, "Sold!" Refco owned most of the certificated stock
at that time [the type of cotton available for delivery against the contract]. In an instant I realized
that they intended to deliver against the July contract, which then was trading at about a 4-cent
premium to the October contract. It also dawned on me that the whole congestion pattern that had
formed between 82 and 86 cents was going to be a market measurement for the next move down
[the break from 82 cents was going to equal the width of the prior 4-cent trading range].
So you knew you were wrong immediately?
I saw immediately that the market was going straight down to 78 cents, and that it was my blood
that was going to carry it there. I had come in long 400 contracts, entered another 100 as a day
trade, and a final 100 on that macho-type bid that I should never have made.
So you realized instantly that you wanted to be out.
No, I realized instantly that I wanted to be short.
How fast did you react?
Almost immediately. When the Refco broker shouted, "Sold," everyone in the ring turned around
and looked at me, because they knew what I was trying to do. The guy standing next to me said, "If
you want to go to the bathroom, do it right here." He said I looked three shades of white. I
remember turning around, walking out, getting a drink of water, and then telling my broker to sell
as much as he could. The market was limit-down in sixty seconds, and I was only able to sell 220
contracts.
When did you get out of the rest of your position?
The next morning the market opened 100 points lower and I started selling from the opening bell. I
sold only about 150 contracts before the market locked limit-down again. By the time it was all
over, I ended up selling some contracts as much as 4 cents below the point I first knew the position
was no good.
Even though you reacted fairly quickly, you still took a big hit. In retrospect, what should you
have done?
First of all, never play macho man with the market. Second, never overtrade. My major problem
was not the number of points I lost on the trade, but that I was trading far too many contracts
relative to the equity in the accounts that I handled. My accounts lost something like 60 to 70
percent of their equity in that single trade.
Did that particular trade change your whole trading style in terms of risk?
Absolutely. I was totally demoralized. I said, "I am not cut out for this business; I don't think I can
hack it much longer." I was so depressed that I nearly quit.
How many years had you been in the business at that time?
Only about three and a half years.
Had you been successful up to that point?
Relatively. Most of my clients had made money, and I was an important producer for my company.
How about someone who had given you $10,000 at the beginning of the three-year period?
They were probably up about threefold.
So everyone who was with you for a long time was still ahead of the game?
Yes, but I had to suffer some intense drawdowns during the interim. That cotton trade was almost
the deal-breaker for me. It was at that point that I said, "Mr. Stupid, why risk everything on one
trade? Why not make your life a pursuit of happiness rather than pain?"
That was when I first decided I had to learn discipline and money management. It was a cathartic
experience for me, in the sense that I went to the edge, questioned my very ability as a trader, and
decided that I was not going to quit. I was determined to come back and fight. I decided that I was
going to become very disciplined and businesslike about my trading.
63



==================================================
                     PAGE 64                      
==================================================

Did your trading style change radically from that point on?
Yes. Now I spend my day trying to make myself as happy and relaxed as I can be. If I have
positions going against me, I get right out; if they are going forme, I keep them.
I guess you not only started trading smaller, but also quicker?
Quicker and more defensive. I am always thinking about losing money as opposed to making
money. Back then, in that cotton trade, I had a vision of July going to 89 cents and I thought about
all the money I was going to make on 400 contracts. I didn't think about what I could lose.
Do you always know where you are getting out before you put a trade on?
I have a mental stop. If it hits that number, I am out no matter what. How much do you risk on any
single trade?
I don't break it down trade by trade. All the trades I have on are interrelated. I look at it in terms of
what my equity is each morning. My goal is to finish each day with more than I started. Tomorrow
morning I will not walk in and say, "I am short the S&P from 264 and it closed at 257 yesterday;
therefore, I can stand a rally." I always think of it in terms of being short from the previous night's
close.
Risk control is the most important thing in trading. For example, right now I am down about 6'/
2
percent for the топшТТНауе а З'б percent stop on my equity for the rest of the month. I want to
make sure that I never have a double-digit loss in any month.
One aspect of your trading style is a contrarian attempt to buy and sell turning points. Let's
say you are looking for a top and go short with a close stop when the market reaches a new
high. You then get stopped out. On a single trade idea, how many times will you try to pick a
turning point before you give up?
Until I change my mind, fundamentally. Otherwise, I will keep cutting my position size down as I
have losing trades. When I am trading poorly, I keep reducing my position size. That way, I will be
trading my smallest position size when my trading is worst.
What are the trading rules you live by?
Don't ever average losers. Decrease your trading volume when you are trading poorly; increase
your volume when you are trading well. Never trade in situations where you don't have control. For
example, I don't risk significant amounts of money in front of key reports, since that is gambling,
not trading.
If you have a losing position that is making you uncomfortable, the solution is very simple: Get out,
because you can always get back in. There is nothing better than a fresh start.
Don't be too concerned about where you got into a position. The only relevant question is whether
you are bullish or bearish on the position that day. Always think of your entry point as last night's
close. I can always tell a rookie trader because he will ask me, "Are you short or long?" Whether I
am long or short should have no bearing on his market opinion. Next he will ask (assuming I have
told him I am long), "Where are you long from?" Who cares where I am long from. That has no
relevance to whether the market environment is bullish or bearish right now, or to the risk/reward
balance of a long position at that moment.
The most important rale of trading is to play great defense, not great offense. Every day I assume
every position I have is wrong. I know where my stop risk points are going to be. I do that so I can
define my maximum possible drawdown. Hopefully, I spend the rest of the day enjoying positions
that are going in my direction. If they are going against me, then I have a game plan for getting out.
Don't be a hero. Don't have an ego. Always question yourself and your ability. Don't ever feel that
you are very good. The second you do, you are dead.
Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest speculators of all time, reportedly said that, in the long ran,
you can't ever win trading markets. That was a devastating quote for someone like me, just getting
into the business. The idea that you can't beat the markets is a frightening prospect. That is why my
guiding philosophy is playing great defense. If you make a good trade, don't think it is because you
have some uncanny foresight. Always maintain your sense of confidence, but keep it in check.
But you have been very successful for years. Aren't you more confident now than you were
before?
I am more scared now than I was at any point since I began trading, because I recognize how
64



==================================================
                     PAGE 65                      
==================================================

ephemeral success can be in this business. I know that to be successful, I have to be frightened. My
biggest hits have always come after I have had a great period and I started to think that I knew
something.
My impression is that you often implement positions near market turns. Sometimes your
precision has been uncanny. What is it about your decision-making process that allows you to
get in so close to the turns?
I have very strong views of the long-ran direction of all markets. I also have a very short-term
horizon for pain. As a result, frequently, I may try repeated trades from the long side over a period
of weeks in a market which continues to move lower.
Is it a matter of doing a series of probes until you finally hit it?
Exactly. I consider myself a premier market opportunist. That means I develop an idea on the
market and pursue it from a very-low-risk standpoint until I have repeatedly been proven wrong, or
until I change my viewpoint.
In other words, it makes a better story to say, "Paul Jones buys the T-bond market 2 ticks
from the low," rather than, "On his fifth try, Paul Jones buys the T-bond market 2 ticks from
its low."
I think that is certainly part of it. The other part is that I have always been a swing trader, meaning
that I believe the very best money is to be made at the market turns. Everyone says you get killed
trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make all the money by catching the trends in the middle.
Well, for twelve years, I have often been missing the meat in the middle, but I have caught a lot of
bottoms and tops.
If you are a trend follower trying to catch the profits in the middle of a move, you have to use very
wide stops. I'm not comfortable doing that. Also, markets trend only about 15 percent of the time;
the rest of the time they move sideways.
What is the most prominent fallacy in the public's perception about markets?
That markets can be manipulated. That there is some group on Wall Street that controls price action
in the markets. I can go into any market and create a stir for a day or two, maybe even a week. If I
go into a market at just the right moment, by giving it a little gas on the upside, I can create the
illusion of a bull market. But, unless the market is really sound, the second I stop buying, the price
is going to come right down. You can open the most beautiful Saks Fifth Avenue in Anchorage,
Alaska, with a wonderful summer menswear department, but unless somebody wants to buy the
clothes, you will go broke.
What other misconceptions do people have about the markets?
The idea that people affiliated with Wall Street know something. My mother is a classic example.
She watches "Wall Street Week" and she takes everything they say with almost a religious fervor. I
would bet that you could probably fade "Wall Street Week."
I know you talk to traders in virtually every major market on an almost daily basis. Are you
uncomfortable about being on the opposite side of the fence from these people?
Yes. Who wants to fade a winner? I want to be with them because I make a point of talking to the
people who have the best track records.
How do you keep all these other opinions from confusing your own vision? Let's say you are
bearish on a market and 75 percent of the people you talk to about that market are bullish. What
do you do?
I wait. I will give you a perfect example. Until last Wednesday, I had been bearish on crude oil,
while it was in the midst of a $2 advance. The best crude oil trader I know was bullish during that
period. Because he was bullish, I never went short. Then the market started to stall and one day he
said, "I think I am going to go flat here." I knew that instant— particularly, given the fact that
bullish news was coming out of OPEC right at that time—that crude oil was a low-risk short. I sold
the hell out of it, and it turned out to be a great trade.
Are there any market advisors that you pay attention to?

==================================================

Marty Zweig and Ned Davis are great; Bob Prechter is the champion. Prechter is the best because
he is the ultimate market opportunist.
What do you mean by opportunist?
The reason he has been so successful is that the Elliott Wave theory allows one to create incredibly
favorable risk/reward opportunities. That is the same reason I attribute a lot of my own success to
the Elliott Wave approach.
Any advisor you consider underrated?
I think Ned Davis does the best research on the stock market that I have seen. Although he is well
known, I don't think he has received the recognition he deserves.
Any analysts you consider overrated?
Judge not, least you be judged.
Very few traders have reached your level of achievement. What makes you different?
I think one of my strengths is that I view anything that has happened up to the present point in time
as history. I really don't care about the mistake I made three seconds ago in the market. What I care
about is what I am going to do from the next moment on. I try to avoid any emotional attachment to
a market. I avoid letting my trading opinions be influenced by comments I may have made on the
record about a market.
No loyalty to positions is obviously an important element in your trading.
It is important because it gives you a wide open intellectual horizon to figure out what is really
happening. It allows you to come in with a completely clean slate in choosing the correct forecast
for that particular market.
Has the tremendous growth of the money you are managing made it more difficult to trade at
the same level of profitability?
It has made it tremendously more difficult.
Do you think you could make a substantially higher percentage return if you were trading
smaller amounts of money?
Without question.
Do you ever question whether the detrimental impact of size on your performance outweighs
profit incentive fees you earn from managing money?
I think about that question every day. It is going to be interesting to see what happens by the time
your book is published.
Have you stopped accepting new investment funds?
Yes, a long time ago.
You have been both a broker and a money manager. How do you compare the relative
advantages and disadvantages of these two jobs?
I got out of the brokerage business because I felt there was a gross conflict of interest: If you are
charging a client commissions and he loses money, you aren't penalized. I went into the money
management business because if I lost money, I wanted to be able to say that I had not gotten
compensated for it. In fact, it would probably cost me a bundle because I have an overhead that
would knock out the Bronx Zoo. I never apologize to anybody, because I don't get paid unless I
win.
Do you keep your money in your own funds?
I would say that 85 percent of my net worth is invested in my own funds, primarily because I
believe that is the safest place in the world for it. I really believe that I am going to be so defensive
and conservative that I will get my money back.
You did extraordinarily well during October 1987, a month which was a disaster for many
other traders. Could you fill in some of the details?
The week of the crash was one of the most exciting periods of my life.
We had been expecting a major stock market collapse since mid-1986 and had contingency plans
66



==================================================
                     PAGE 67                      
==================================================

drawn up because of the possibility we foresaw for a financial meltdown. When we came in on
Monday, October 19, we knew that the market was going to crash that day.
What made you so sure?
Because the previous Friday was a record volume day on the downside. The exact same thing
happened in 1929, two days before the crash. Our analog model to 1929 had the collapse perfectly
nailed. [Paul Jones' analog model, developed by his research director, Peter Borish, superimposed
the 1980s market over the 1920s market. The two markets demonstrated a remarkable degree of
correlation. This model was a key tool in Jones' stock index trading during 1987.] Treasury
Secretary Baker's weekend statement that the U.S. would no longer support the dollar because of its
disagreements with West Germany was the kiss of death for the market.
When did you cover your short position?
We actually covered our shorts and went somewhat long on the close of the day of the crash itself
[October 19].
Were most of your profits in October due to your short stock index position?
No, we also had an extremely profitable bond position. The day of the crash we put on the biggest
bond position we ever had. The bond market had been acting terrible all day long on October 19.
During the day, I was very concerned about the financial safety of our clients' and our own assets.
We had our assets with various commission houses on the street, and I thought those funds could be
in jeopardy. It was an intolerable situation for me.
I kept on thinking: What is the Fed reaction going to be? I thought that thev would have to add
massive amounts of liquidity to create a very rosy environment, instantaneously. However, since
bonds had been acting poorly all day, I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger on a long bond
position. During the last half hour of trading, bonds suddenly started to turn up, and it clicked in my
mind that the Fed was going to take actions that would create a tremendous upsurge in bond prices.
As soon as I saw the bond market act right for a moment, I went wild.
Do you believe that October 1987 was an early warning signal of more negative times ahead?
I think the financial community, particularly Wall Street, was dealt a life-threatening blow on
October 19, but they are in shock and don't realize it. I remember the time I got run over by a boat,
and my backside was chewed up by the propeller. My first thought was, "Dammit, I just ruined my
Sunday afternoon because I have to get stitched up." Because I was in shock, I didn't even realize
how badly cut up I was until I saw the faces of my friends.
Everything gets destroyed a hundred times faster than it is built up. It takes one day to tear down
something that might have taken ten years to build. If the economy starts to go with the kind of
leverage that is in it, it will deteriorate so fast that people's heads will spin. I hate to believe it, but
in my gut that is what I think is going to happen.
I know from studying history that credit eventually kills all great societies. We have essentially
taken out our American Express card and said we are going to have a great time. Reagan made sure
that the economy would be great during his term in office by borrowing our way into prosperity.
We borrowed against the future, and soon we will have to pay.
Are you blaming the current situation on Reaganomics?
I think Reagan made us feel good as a country—and that is wonderful— but, in terms of
economics, he was the biggest disaster that ever struck. I think he basically hoodwinked us by
promising to cut the deficit, and then went on the biggest spending binge in the history of this
country. I don't think a Democrat could have gotten away with it, because everyone would have
been very vigilant about a $150-180 billion deficit.
Do you see any way in which we can solve our current problems before we go into a deep
recession, or even depression?
That is what scares me so much. I don't see any blueprint out of our current dilemma. Maybe there
are macroeconomic forces at work that are part of a larger super cycle that we don't have any
control over. Perhaps we are simply responding to the same type of cycles that most advanced
civilizations fell prey to, whether it was the Romans, sixteenth-century Spain, eighteenth-century

==================================================

France, or nineteenth-century Britain. I think that we are going to be in for a period of pain. We are
going to relearn what financial discipline is all about.
Do you use trading systems at all?
We have tested every system under the sun and, amazingly, we have found one that actually works
well. It is a very good system, but for obvious reasons, I can't tell you much more about it.
What type of realm does it fall into: contrarian? trend following?
Trend following. The basic premise of the system is that markets move sharply when they move. If
there is a sudden range expansion in a market that has been trading narrowly, human nature is to try
to fade that price move. When you get a range expansion, the market is sending you a very loud,
clear signal that the market is getting ready to move in the direction of that expansion.
Are you trading a portion of your funds on that system at the present time?
We just started trading the system about six months ago, and so far it is doing very well.
Do you feel a good system can compete with a good trader?
A good system may be able to trade more markets effectively than a good trader because it has the
advantage of unlimited computing power. After all, every trade decision is the product of some
problem-solving process—human or otherwise. However, because of the complexity in defining
interacting and changing market patterns, a good trader will usually be able to outperform a good
system.
But a good system can help diversify?
Unequivocally. A good system will catch ten times as much of the price move as I will, during the
15 percent of the time a market is in a major trending phase.
The following section of the interview was conducted two weeks later. During the interim, Jones
had reversed his trading bias on the stock market from bearish to bullish.
Two weeks ago you were very bearish. What made you change your mind?
You mean besides the Wall Street Journal article that publicized to the world that I was short 2,000
S&P contracts? The market didn't go down. The first thing I do is put my ear to the railroad tracks.
I always believe that prices move first and fundamentals come second.
Do you mean that if you were right, prices should have gone down and the didn't?
and; they didn't?
One of the things that Tullis taught me was the importance of time. When I trade, I don't just use a
price stop, I also use a time stop. If I think a market should break, and it doesn't, I will often get out
even if I am not losing any money. According to the 1929 analog model, the market should have
gone down — it didn't. This was the first time during the past three years that we had a serious
divergence. I think the strength of the economy is going to delay the stock market break.
I believe one reason why we are diverging from the 1 929 model is because of the much easier
availability of credit today. Volvo is giving out 120-month car loans. Think about that! Who owns a
car for ten years? Twenty years ago, the average length of a car loan was twenty-four months;
today it is fifty-five months. I think the final bottom line will be the same, but the ease of credit will
delay the process relative to the 1920s, when we had a cash economy.
Some of your preliminary comments before the start of our interview today make it sound
like you are paranoid because of your success.
If the misery in this country gets deep enough, the perception is going to be that we did well as a
trading firm, while other people were hurt, because we had some knowledge. It is not that we had
any unfair knowledge that other people didn't have, it is just that we did our homework. People just
don't want to believe that anyone can break away from the crowd and rise above mediocrity.
I understand that, similar to a number of other traders I have interviewed, you have trained a
group of apprentice traders. What was your motivation?
When I was twenty-one years old, a guy took me under his wing and it was the greatest thing that
ever happened to me. I felt an obligation to do the same thing for other people.
68



==================================================
                     PAGE 69                      
==================================================

How did you find the people you trained?
Countless interviews. We have been deluged by applicants.
How many traders have you hired?
About thirty-five.
Have they been successful?
Some have done very well, but overall we have had mixed success.
Do you believe that is because it takes talent to be a good trader?
I never thought that before, but I am starting to believe that now. One of my weaknesses is that I
always tend to be too optimistic, particularly about the ability of other people to succeed.
Was your I Have a Dream Program, in which you have pledged to sponsor the education of a
group of kids from a poverty sticken area, inspired by the "60 Minutes" show about Eugene
Lang?
Right. I went to talk to him the week after the show, and within three months we had set up our
own program. I have always been a big believer in leverage. The thing that really turned me on
about the program was the potential for its multiplicative impact. By helping one kid, you can have
an impact on his family and other kids.
We have also recently set up a new program called the Robin Hood Foundation. We are trying to
seek out and fund people who are on the frontlines in providing food and shelter to the poor. We
are seeking out the people who are used to working with virtually no budget at all, rather than the
bureaucracies, which often do not deploy the money effectively.
Has this become a major part of your life?
I would say so. The markets have been so good to me that I feel I should give back something in
return. I can't say that I have been successful because I am better than anybody else. By the grace of
God, I was in the right place at the right time, so I feel a tremendous obligation to share.
Is the positive intensity of winning as strong as the pain of losing?
There is nothing worse than a bad trading day. You feel so low that it is difficult to hold your head
up. But, if I knew that I could also have a similar experience in the exhilaration of winning, I would
take the combination of winning and losing days any time because you feel that much more alive.
Trading gives you an incredibly intense feeling of what life is all about. Emotionally, you live on
the extremes.
What is the most important advice you could give the average trader?
Don't focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have.
Do you still see yourself trading ten or fifteen years down the road?
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Paul Jones was a winning trader from his start in the business, but, in the early years, his
performance was volatile. It took a traumatic trading experience to permanently forge the
importance of risk control into his mind. Since that gut-wrenching cotton trade in 1979, Jones has
managed to maintain excellent net profitability, while bringing his risk way down.
Today, risk control is the essence of Jones' trading style and success. He never thinks about what he
might make on a given trade, but only on what he could lose. He mentally marks each of his
positions to the market. No matter how large a profit he may have in a position, in Jones' mind his
entry price was the previous night's close. Since this approach assures that there is never a cushion
in his trades, Jones never gets complacent about any of his positions. He not only watches the risk
of each position, but he closely monitors the performance of his entire portfolio in real-time. If his
total equity drops 1 to 2 percent during a single trading session, he might well liquidate all of his
positions instantaneously to cut his risk. "It is always easier to get back in than to get out," he says.
If Jones' trading starts going poorly, he will continually reduce his position size until he is on track
again. That way, when he is trading his worst, he is also trading his smallest. In any month with net
trading losses, Jones will automatically reduce his risk exposure to make sure he never registers a

==================================================

double-digit loss in a single month. After big winning streaks, he is particularly cautious about
getting overconfident.
In short, Jones maintains risk control in a dozen different ways. As he puts it, "The most important
rule in trading is: Play great defense, not great offense."

Gary Bielfeldt-Yes, They Do Trade T-Bonds in Peoria
For years, I have heard the name BLH mentioned as one of the major players in the futures
markets, particularly T-bonds, the world's largest futures market. I assumed BLH was a huge
trading corporation, but in seeking out the country's best traders, I discovered that BLH was basi-
cally a single individual: Gary Bielfeldt.
Who is Gary Bielfeldt? Where did he get the capital to rival the primary Wall Street institutions as
a major force in the T-bond futures market? Bielfeldt began his trading career twenty-five years
ago, with a mere $1,000 investment. At first, his capital was so limited he confined himself to
trading a single corn contract—one of the smallest futures contracts at a time of relative stagnation
in agricultural prices. From this extremely modest start, Bielfeldt eventually built his account up to
staggering proportions.
How did he do it? Bielfeldt does not believe in diversification. His trading philosophy is that you
pick one area and become expert at it. For much of his trading career, the soybean complex and, to
a more minor extent, the related grain markets provided that focal point of attention.
Although Bielfeldt had the desire to become a full-time trader from the beginning, his tiny capital
base restricted his trading to a part-time endeavor. In those early years, he earned his living running
a small brokerage office. The problem he faced was how he, a trader without any independent
funds, could develop a sufficient capital base to become a professional trader. Bielfeldt's strong
desire to make this leap in his capital base prompted him to take a large, if not imprudent, risk.
By 1965, Bielfeldt had painstakingly built up his initial $1,000 stake to $10,000. Based on his
fundamental evaluation of the soybean market, as well as the concurring opinion by his former
agricultural economics professor, Thomas Hieronymus, Bielfeldt strongly believed that prices
would go higher. In an all-or-nothing play, he bought twenty soybean contracts, an extremely high-
leverage position given his $10,000 account size. A mere 10-cent price decline would have com-
pletely wiped out his account, while a considerably smaller decline would have been sufficient to
generate a forced-liquidation margin call. Initially, prices did move lower, and Bielfeldt came
perilously close to that damaging margin call. But he held on, and prices eventually reversed to the
upside. By the time he liquidated the position, he had more than doubled his equity on that single
trade. That trade launched Bielfeldt toward his much sought after goal of becoming a full-time
trader.
Bielfeldt built his account with unerring consistency. By the early 1980s, Bielfeldt's trading size
had grown to the point that government-established speculative position limits in the soybean and
grain markets were becoming an impediment. This factor, aided by a particularly bad trade in the
soybean market in 1983, prompted Bielfeldt to shift his focus to the T-bond futures market, which
at the time had no position limit. (Although a position limit was eventually implemented in the T-
bond market, the 10,000 contract limit dwarfed the 600-contract limit in soybeans.)
The 1983 soybean loss may have been the best thing that ever happened to Bielfeldt. His shift to T-
bonds coincided with an evolving major bottom in that market. He became very bullish and built up
a huge long T-bond position at the right time. When the T-bond market exploded during the mid-
1984 to early 1986 period, Bielfeldt was perfectly positioned to garner huge profits. His ability to
stay with a major position for a long-term move allowed him to leverage his well-timed trade to a
much greater degree than would have been achieved by most professional traders with the same
initial position. This long T-bond position was Bielfeldt's best trade ever and catapulted him into a
new echelon. That, in short, is the story of how a one-lot corn trader became a T-bond futures
trader in the same league as the most prominent institutional market participants.
Bielfeldt could not be further removed from the popular image of a large-scale trader in the highly
leveraged sphere of futures trading. One would hardly expect to find one of the world's largest bond
traders in Peoria. Bielfeldt's attachment to his home town is so strong that he refused to consider
becoming a trader on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade because it would have meant giving
up his cherished lifestyle. He is the epitome of the small town model American citizen: honest, hard
working, devoted to family and community. One of Bielfeldt's major goals has been to plow back a
portion of his trading-derived wealth into projects benefiting his home town.
I interviewed Bielfeldt in his large, comfortably furnished office. The huge, wraparound desk
71



==================================================
                     PAGE 72                      
==================================================

configuration was flanked by ten quote screens. Despite this vast array of electronics, Bielfeldt was
low keyed. He rarely glanced at the screens during the afternoon I spent in his office, and it is hard
to visualize him trading frantically at any time, the vast array of quote machines notwithstanding.
Bielfeldt is a soft-spoken man of few words. He is also a very modest man who consistently
hesitated talking about his achievements, lest it sound like bragging. His very conservative nature
led him to avoid even seemingly innocuous subjects. For example, at one point in discussing the
reasons for his net trading losses in a given year, he asked me to turn off my tape recorder. I could
hardly imagine what he might say that necessitated this precautionary measure. The off-the-record
comments proved far from shocking. It turned out that his trading losses in that year were
influenced by an overextension into other commitments, including his membership on the Chicago
Board of Trade Board of Directors, a position which required frequent travel to Chicago. Ap-
parently, he was reluctant to be quoted because he did not want to make it seem that he was
blaming his other responsibilities—which he deemed part of his natural obligations—for his trading
losses.
The combination of Bielfeldt's laconic nature, modesty, and conservatism made this a very difficult
interview. In fact, this was the only interview I conducted in which the average length of the
questions was longer than the average length of the responses. I considered deleting the interview
from the book—a tempting choice since I had an excess of material. However, I found Bielfeldt's
story so compelling and his character so strong that I was reluctant to take the easy way out. As a
compromise, I weighted this chapter to the narrative side and limited the interview section to a few
excerpts.
What is your basic approach in analyzing and trading the markets?
I always try to lean primarily on fundamental analysis. However, since I found it was very difficult
to know all the fundamentals—usually you are doing pretty well if you have 80 percent of the
pieces—I thought it was important to have something to fall back on in case my fundamental
analysis was wrong.
I assume you are referring to technical analysis as a supplement.
Right. I developed my own trend-following system.
Do you trade this system in any consistent way?
I use the system primarily as a backup to tell me when to get out of a position.
Can you think of an example?
At the start of 1988,1 was long the bond market primarily because I was expecting a weaker
economy. Everything seemed to be on target until early March when the bond market started
edging down. At some point, you have to say you are wrong. In this case, my system provided me
with the rationale for getting out of my losing position.
What went wrong with that trade?
Basically, the economy was a lot stronger than I had anticipated. I thought that there would be a
bigger fear factor left over from the October 1987 stock market crash than actually materialized.
What is your opinion of trend-following systems?
The best thing anyone can do when starting out is to learn how a trend system works. Trading a
trend system for a while will teach a new trader the principle of letting profits run and cutting losses
short. If you can just learn discipline by using a trend-following system, even temporarily, it will
increase your odds of being successful as a trader.
Do you have an opinion about systems sold to the public?
I looked at some of these systems a few years ago and found that they generally made too many
trades. If a system trades too frequently, the transaction costs will be too high, a factor that will
significantly reduce the probability of the system working. I think to be viable, a trend-following
system has to be medium to longer term. The more sensitive systems just generate too much
commission.
Besides providing a training vehicle for learning good trading habits, do you feel that trend-
72



==================================================
                     PAGE 73                      
==================================================

following systems can provide an effective trading approach?
I would advise anyone who develops a system to combine it with their own judgment. In other
words, they should trade half the money on a system and the other half using their own judgment,
just in case the system isn't working.
Is that the way you trade?
I used to pay more attention to systems than I do now. Basically, I just focus on my own judgment.
Is that because your own judgment is more reliable, or because systems haven't been working
as well as they used to?
They haven't worked as well as they used to because there are too many people using them.
Whenever too many people are doing the same thing, the market will go through a period of
adjustment.
What are the key factors you focus on in fundamentally evaluating the T-bond market?
The economy is definitely the single most important factor. Four other important elements are
inflation expectations, the dollar, the trade balance, and the budget deficit.
You have been trading for over twenty-five years—a much longer time period than most
other traders. Is there any single trade that stands out as the most dramatic?
There are quite a few trades that would qualify as dramatic, but the one that stands out most
prominently was my attempt to pick the bottom of the bond market in 1983 and 1984.
When did you start trying to buy the bonds?
I started trying to pick a bottom when the bonds were trading in the 63-66 area.
How much risk did you allow when putting on a trade?
Generally anywhere from \ to ГА points. [One point in T-bond futures is equal to 32 ticks. A 1-point
move is equal to $1,000 per contract.]
So if you tried to pick a spot that looked good and it didn't work, you would bail out and try
again at another spot?
Right.
Since bonds eventually declined into the 50s, I guess you must have had a few strikes against
you before you finally went long in the right place.
Yes, there were several losses over a period of time.
Do you remember when you finally got positioned at a point where you didn't have to get
out?
I turned really bullish in May 1984, when they auctioned off five-year notes at a 13.93 yield. I had
been involved in banking since 1974, and at the time, we couldn't find any qualified borrowers for
three-year loans at 13 percent. Yet here were government five-year notes selling at nearly a full
percentage point above that level. Moreover, this was at a time when we were at the height of a
recession in Peoria: Unemployment was approaching 20 percent and the farm crisis was worsening.
I felt that interest rates had probably gone high enough. From that point on through April 1986,1
traded T-bonds heavily from the long side. There is no question that that was my best trade and
longest trend ever.
What are the elements of good trading?
The most important thing is to have a method for staying with your winners and getting rid of your
losers.
What do you do to make sure that you stay with a winning position to exploit the longer-term
trend? How do you avoid the temptation of taking profits prematurely?
The best way I know to learn discipline and patience is to think through a trade thoroughly before
putting it on. You need to develop a plan of your strategies for various contingencies. That way,
you won't get swayed by every news item that hits the market and causes prices to move up or
down. Also, it helps greatly to have a long-term objective that you have derived by really doing
your homework. You combine that long-term objective with a protective stop that you move as the
73



==================================================
                     PAGE 74                      
==================================================

position goes your way. Alternatively, you could use a trend-following system to signal when you
should get out of the trade. By having thought out your objective and having a strategy for getting
out in case the market trend changes, you greatly increase the potential for staying in your winning
positions.
Why do most traders lose?
They overtrade, which means that they have to be right a lot just to cover commissions.
What are the traits of a successful trader?
The most important is discipline—I am sure everyone tells you that. Second, you have to have
patience; if you have a good trade on, you have to be able to stay with it. Third, you need courage
to go into the market, and courage comes from adequate capitalization. Fourth, you must have a
willingness to lose; that is also related to adequate capitalization. Fifth, you need a strong desire to
win.
Those elements seem fairly straightforward, except for the willingness to lose. Can you
expound on that?
You should have the attitude that if a trade loses, you can handle it without any problem and come
back to do the next trade. You can't let a losing trade get to you emotionally.
Can you talk more about what you mean by courage?
If a 260-pound fullback is running through the line and a 175-pound linebacker has to stop him, he
has to have the courage to go into him. You need that kind of courage to be able to participate in
the markets. If everyone is bullish the dollar, and the yen is sharply lower, it takes courage to fade
that major consensus and buy the yen.
How do you judge success?
Most people will judge success by how well they do in their field. A teacher would judge success
by how well the students do and how they go through life. A trader would probably judge success
by whether he wins or loses in the market.
Speaking personally, how do you judge success'.
I judge success by what I do with the money I accumulate. One of the things that my wife and I
have done is to establish a foundation so that we could share some of our success with the
community by supporting various programs.
Is this foundation one that you just fund, or do you have a hands-on relationship in running
it?
My family and I are directly involved in evaluating different projects and deciding which ones to
fund.
When did you set up this foundation?
In 1985. But I had thought about the idea as far back as the early 1970s. I had always planned that
if I were to become successful, I would set up a foundation to help the community.
Do you think this long-term goal was an important motivation leading to your success as a
trader?
Yes, I think it helped.
What advice do you have for the beginning trader?
When you are starting out, it is very important not to get too far behind because it is very difficult
to fight back. Most traders have a tendency to take risks that are too large at the beginning. They
tend not to be selective enough about when they take risks.
At this point, Bielfeldt asked me to turn off the tape recorder. He talked about the relevance and
application of poker strategy to trading. His reason for keeping the comments off-the-record was
that he didn't want to contribute to the image of trading as a form of gambling. I found his analogy
particularly apropos and finally persuaded him to put it on the record.
Could you explain your analogy between trading and poker?
I learned how to play poker at a very young age. My father taught me the concept of playing the
74



==================================================
                     PAGE 75                      
==================================================

percentage hands. You don't just play every hand and stay through every card, because if you do,
you will have a much higher probability of losing. You should play the good hands, and drop out of
the poor hands, forfeiting the ante. When more of the cards are on the table and you have a very
strong hand—in other words, when you feel the percentages are skewed in your favor—you raise
and play that hand to the hilt.
If you apply the same principles of poker strategy to trading, it increases your odds of winning
significantly. I have always tried to keep the concept of patience in mind by waiting for the right
trade, just like you wait for the percentage hand in poker. If a trade doesn't look right, you get out
and take a small loss; it's precisely equivalent to forfeiting the ante by dropping out of a poor hand
in poker. On the other hand, when the percentages seem to be strongly in your favor, you should be
aggressive and really try to leverage the trade similar to the way you raise on the good hands in
poker.
Bielfeldt's story provides an inspiring example of what is attainable given patience on the one hand
and an aggressive trading style on the other. Here is an individual who, starting with a minuscule
amount of money, working independently, and without benefit of staff or elaborate technology,
became one of the world's most successful traders. Moreover, because of his long-term goals and
actions, his ultimate success positively impacted an entire community.
The portion of Gary Bielfeldt's interview that I found most insightful was his analogy between
poker and trading. It is also interesting to compare Bielfeldt's key point in this analogy to the
similar advice offered by James Rogers: Have the patience to wait for the right trade to come along.

==================================================

Ed Seykota-Everybody Gets What They Want
Although completely unknown, not only to the public, but to most of the financial community as
well, Ed Seykota's achievements must certainly rank him as one of the best traders of our time. In
the early 1970s, Seykota was hired by a major brokerage firm. He conceived and developed the
first commercial computerized trading system for managing clients' money in the futures markets.
His system proved quite profitable, but interference and second-guessing by management
significantly impeded its performance. This experience provided the catalyst for Seykota going out
on his own.
In the ensuing years, Seykota applied his systematized approach to trading a handful of accounts
and his own money. During that period, the accounts Seykota managed have witnessed an
absolutely astounding rate of return. For example, as of mid-1988, one of his customer accounts,
which started with $5,000 in 1972, was up over 250,000 percent on a cash-on-cash basis.
(Normalized for withdrawals, the account theoretically was up several million percent.) I know of
no other trader who has matched this track record over the same length of time.
I had never heard of Seykota when I first began working on this book. Seykota's name had come up
several times during my interview of Michael Marcus as the person who was most influential in
transforming him into a successful trader. After our interview, Marcus said reflectively, "You
know, you really should interview Ed Seykota. He is not only a great trader; he is a mind."
Marcus provided an introduction over the phone, and I briefly outlined the concept of my book to
Seykota. Since I was already out West, it was most convenient for me to interview Seykota on the
same trip by rerouting my return to New York via Reno. Seykota was agreeable to participating,
but seemed skeptical of my ability to complete the inter-vie w in the space of two hours (the time
available in order for me to make my flight connections). I assured him that, although it was tight, I
had done a few other interviews in that space of time. "It is feasible as long as our conversation
remains very focused," I explained.
I cut my arrival at the airport extremely close, having forgotten to revise my ticket to reflect the
change in itinerary. After a vociferous argument with a ticket agent who insisted I didn't have
enough time to catch my flight—a contention she nearly made self-fulfilling—I raced through the
airport, reaching the gate with only seconds to spare. By the time I arrived in Reno, the tension
from my near-missed flight had just about dissipated. The drive to Seykota's house was too far for a
cab, so I rented a car. It was very early morning, and the highway winding up into the mountains
offered spectacular vistas below. The classical music station I found on the radio was playing
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto. The combination was glorious.
Seykota works from an office in his house, which borders Lake Tahoe. Before beginning the
interview, we took a brief walk out onto the beach behind his house. It was a cold, clear morning,
and the view was idyllic. The contrast between his workplace and my own—an office in the Wall
Street area, with a prominent view of an ugly building—could hardly have been more striking. I
plead guilty to jealousy.
In contrast to virtually all the other traders I had interviewed, Seykota's desk is not flanked by an
array of quote screens, or, for that matter, even a single screen. His trading is largely confined to
the few minutes it takes to run his computer program which generates signals for the next day.
In my conversation with Seykota, I was struck by the intensity of both his intelligence and
sensitivity—an odd combination I thought. He has a way of looking at things from a unique
vantage point. At one moment, he could be talking about analytical techniques and would appear as
the consummate scientist (he holds a degree in electrical engineering from MIT), bringing up a
three-dimensional diagram on the computer screen, generated by one of the many programs he had
designed. Yet, in another moment, when the conversation turned to the psychology of trading, he
would reveal great sensitivity and insight into human behavior.
Indeed, in recent years, Seykota has become very involved in the field of psychology. It appeared
to me that psychology, and its application in helping people solve their problems, had become a
more important element in his life than market analysis and trading. I suspect that Seykota would
probably find this contrast somewhat artificial, in that to him, trading and psychology are one and
the same thing.

==================================================
                     PAGE 77                      
==================================================

Our conversation was not as focused as I had intended it to be. In fact, it went off in so many
directions that we had barely scratched the surface by the time the two hours had elapsed. I
continued on, assuming that I would merely catch a later flight. As it turned out, the flight that I had
missed was the last direct one from Reno to New York.
Seykota later told me that he knew in our first phone conversation that I would end up spending the
day. He is extremely perceptive about people. For example, at one point in our conversation,
Seykota asked me, "How many minutes fast do you set your watch?" I found this question
particularly striking in that in our brief time together, he had been able to pick up on one of my
basic character traits. The question was also particularly timely, given my near-missed flight earlier
that morning.
Seykota's success goes well beyond his trading. He impressed me as someone who had found
meaning in his life, and was living exactly the life he wanted to be living.
How did you first get involved in trading?
In the late 1960s, I decided that silver had to rise when the U.S. Treasury stopped selling it. I
opened a commodity margin account to take full advantage of my insight. While I was waiting, my
broker convinced me to short some copper. I soon got stopped out and lost some money and my
trading virginity. So I went back to waiting for the start of the big, inevitable bull market in silver.
Finally, the day arrived. I bought. Much to my amazement and financial detriment, the price started
falling!
At first it seemed impossible to me that silver could fall on such a bullish deal. Yet the price was
falling and that was a fact. Soon my stop got hit. This was a very stunning education about the way
markets discount news. I became more and more fascinated with how markets work.
About that time, I saw a letter published by Richard Donchian, which implied that a purely
mechanical trend-following system could beat the markets. This too seemed impossible to me. So I
wrote computer programs (on punch cards in those days) to test the theories. Amazingly, his
theories tested true. To this day, I'm not sure I understand why or whether I really need to.
Anyhow, studying the markets, and backing up my opinions with money, was so fascinating
compared to my other career opportunities at the time, that I began trading full time for a living.
What was your first trading-related job?
I landed my first job on Wall Street in the early 1970s as an analyst with a major brokerage house. I
was assigned to cover the egg and broiler markets. [Broilers are young chickens up to 2'<i pounds
dressed weight. The futures markets for both broilers and eggs have since disappeared as waning
trading activity prompted their delisting by the parent exchanges.] I found it interesting that an
entry level guy like me was immediately placed in charge of dispensing trading advice. I once
wrote an article recommending that traders stay away from the market for a while. Management
censored that comment from the market letter— likely because it didn't promise to motivate much
trading.
I wanted to start applying computers to the business of analysis. Remember, in those days
computers were still typically punch card devices used for accounting. The guy who was running
the computer department seemed to see me as a threat to his job security, and he repeatedly chased
me off his turf. After about a month at that job, I announced that I was going to quit. The head of
the department called me in to find out why. It was the first time he had ever been interested in
talking to me.
I went to work for another brokerage house, which was going through a reorganization. There was
a lot less management, so I took advantage of the lack of supervision by using the accounting
computer to test trading systems during the weekends. They had an IBM 360 which took up a large
air conditioned room. Over the course of about a half year, I was able to test about a hundred
variations of four simple systems for about ten years of data on ten commodities. Today, the same
job takes about one day on a PC. Anyway, I got my results. They confirmed there was a possibility
of making money from trend-following systems.
I take it that computer testing of systems was not part of your job, since you did it on
weekends. What were you actually hired to do?
During the week, my normal Clark Kent type job was to load new rolls of paper onto the Reuters
77



==================================================
                     PAGE 78                      
==================================================

machine when the margin turned pink. I was also responsible for tearing off the news in strips and
hanging them up on the wall behind the machine. The trick was to tear between line-feeds so as to
get a smooth edge. The funny thing was that hardly anyone would read the news since they'd have
to lean way over the machine to see the pages. So I started reading the news and personally
delivering it to the brokers. One bonus of this job was that I got to observe a lot of brokers' trading
styles.
Your official position sounds like a glorified office boy. Why did you accept such a menial
job?
Because I knew I wanted to be in the business, and I didn't care what I did, or what I got paid.
Why didn't you stay at your original position? At least there you were an analyst.
Because it was a stultifying environment. I disapproved of management pressures to recommend
trades when I thought there were no trading opportunities. Also, I saw that being allowed access to
the company computers for testing trading systems (my real desire) was a dead issue.
Did you know that you could have access to the computer at your new job?
No, but since the company had just gone through a major shake-up and most of the management
had been fired, I figured there wouldn't be very much of a bureaucracy to interfere with my use of
the computer.
What became of your work on computerized trading systems?
Eventually, management got interested in using my research results for managing money. I
developed the first large-scale commercial computerized trading system.
What do you mean by large scale?
The program was marketed by several hundred agents of the firm, and the equity under
management was several million dollars—a large amount of money in the early 1970s.
How did you get management to support you to that extent?
They were familiar with Richard Donchian, who was a pioneer in developing trend-following
trading systems, although, at the time, he was doing everything by hand. Because of that exposure,
they were already favorably disposed to the concept of using trading systems to manage money.
Also, at the time, computers were so new that "computer system" was a great buzzword.
How did your trading program do?
The program did fine; the problem was that management couldn't keep from second-guessing the
signals. For example, I remember one time the program generated a buy signal for sugar when it
was trading around 5 cents. Management thought that the market was already overbought and
decided not to take the signal. When the market kept on going higher, they came up with the rule
that they would buy on the first 20-point pullback [ 100 points equal 1 cent]. When no such
pullback developed, they modified the rule to buying on the first 30-point reaction.
As the market kept moving higher without any meaningful retracements, they changed the rule to
50 points and eventually 100 points. Finally, with sugar prices around 9 cents, they finally decided
that it was a bull market, and that they had better buy before prices went much higher. They put the
managed accounts long at that point. As you might guess, the sugar market peaked shortly
thereafter. They compounded the error by ignoring the sell signal as well—a signal which also
would have been very profitable.
The bottom line was that because of this interference, the most profitable trade of the year ended up
losing money. As a result, instead of a theoretical return of 60 percent for the year, quite a few
accounts actually lost money. This type of meddling was one of the main reasons why I eventually
quit.
What were the other reasons?
Management wanted me to change the system so that it would trade more actively, thereby
generating more commission income. I explained to them that it would be very easy to make such a
change, but doing so would seriously impede performance. They didn't seem to care.
What did you do after you quit?
78



==================================================
                     PAGE 79                      
==================================================

I just quit the research department, but I stayed on as a broker managing accounts. After about two
years, I gave up brokerage to become a money manager. That shift allowed me to get away from
earning my living from commissions, which I think can be a counterproductive incentive to making
money for clients. I switched to a pure profit incentive fee arrangement.
Did you continue trading the system after you left?
Yes, although I substantially revised the system over the years.
What is the performance track record?
I do not publicize my track record other than my "model account," which is an actual customer
account that started with $5,000 in 1972 and has made over $15 million. Theoretically, the total
return would have been many multiples larger had there been no withdrawals.
With performance like that, how come you haven't been deluged with word-of-mouth
requests to manage money?
I do receive requests, but I very rarely accept new accounts. If I do, it is only after considerable
interviewing and screening to determine the motivations and attitudes of the client. I have found
that the people I associate with have subtle, yet very important, effects on my performance. If, for
example, they are able to support me and my methods over the long term, then they tend to help
me. If, however, they get too concerned with the short-term ups and downs of their account, they
can be a hindrance.
How many accounts did you originally start out with?
About a half dozen back in the early 1970s.
How many of those accounts are still with you?
Four. One client made about $15 million and decided to withdraw his money and manage it
himself; another made over $10 million and decided to buy a house on the beach and retire.
What source did you learn from before designing your first system?
I was inspired and influenced by the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and also by Richard
Donchian's five- and twenty-day moving average crossover system and his weekly rule system. I
consider Donchian to be one of the guiding lights of technical trading.
What was your first trading system?
My first system was a variation of Donchian's moving average system. I used an exponential
averaging method because it was easier to calculate and computational errors tended to disappear
over time. It was so new at the time that it was being passed around by word of mouth as the
"expedential system."
Your reference to a first system implies that you eventually changed systems. How did you
know when your system needed to be changed?
Systems don't need to be changed. The trick is for a trader to develop a system with which he is
compatible.
Were you incompatible with your original system?
My original system was very simple with hard-and-fast rules that didn't allow for any deviations. I
found it difficult to stay with the system while disregarding my own feelings. I kept jumping on and
off—often at just the wrong time. I thought I knew better than the system. At the time, I didn't
really trust that trend-following systems would work. There is plenty of literature "proving" they
don't. Also, it seemed a waste of my intellect and MIT education to just sit there and not try to
figure out the markets. Eventually, as I became more confident of trading with the trend, and more
able to ignore the news, I became more comfortable with the approach. Also, as I continued to
incorporate more "expert trader rules," my system became more compatible with my trading style.
What is your trading style?
My style is basically trend following, with some special pattern recognition and money
management algorithms.
Without divulging trade secrets, how have you been able to so spectacularly outperform

==================================================

standard trend-following systems?
The key to long-term survival and prosperity has a lot to do with the money management
techniques incorporated into the technical system. There are old traders and there are bold traders,
but there are very few old, bold traders.
Witty and true, but the question remains, albeit in translated form: There are many trend-
following systems with money management rules; why have you done so much better?
I seem to have a gift. I think it is related to my overall philosophy, which has a lot to do with loving
the markets and maintaining an optimistic attitude. Also, as I keep trading and learning, my system
(that is the mechanical computer version of what I do) keeps evolving. I would add that I consider
myself and how I do things as a kind of system which, by definition, I always follow. Sometimes I
trade entirely off the mechanical part, sometimes I override the signals based on strong feelings,
and sometimes I just quit altogether. The immediate trading result of this jumping around is
probably breakeven to somewhat negative. However, if I didn't allow myself the freedom to
discharge my creative side, it might build up to some kind of blowout. Striking a workable ecology
seems to promote trading longevity, which is one key to success.
How would you compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of systems trading versus
discretionary trading?
Systems trading is ultimately discretionary. The manager still has to decide how much risk to
accept, which markets to play, and how aggressively to increase and decrease the trading base as a
function of equity change. These decisions are quite important—often more important than trade
timing.
What percentage of your trading is systems based? Has this percentage changed over time?
Over time, I have become more mechanical, since (1)1 have become more trusting of trend trading,
and (2) my mechanical programs have factored in more and more "tricks of the trade." I still go
through periods of thinking I can outperform my own system, but such excursions are often self-
correcting through the process of losing money.
What are the present and future prospects for trend-following systems? Do you think the
growing prevalence of their use will doom them to eventual failure?
No. All trading is done on some sort of system, whether or not it is conscious. Many of the good
systems are based on following trends. Life itself is based on trends. Birds start south for the winter
and keep on going. Companies track trends and alter their products accordingly. Tiny protozoa
move in trends along chemical and luminescence gradients.
The profitability of trading systems seems to move in cycles. Periods during which trend-following
systems are highly successful will lead to their increased popularity. As the number of system users
increases, and the markets shift from trending to directionless price action, these systems become
unprofitable, and undercapitalized and inexperienced traders will get shaken out. Longevity is the
key to success.
What are your thoughts about using fundamental analysis as an input in trading?
Fundamentals that you read about are typically useless as the market has already discounted the
price, and I call them "funny-mentals." However, if you catch on early, before others believe, then
you might have valuable "surprise-a-mentals."
Your answer is a bit facetious. Does it imply that you only use technical analysis?
I am primarily a trend trader with touches of hunches based on about twenty years of experience. In
order of importance to me are: (1) the long-term trend, (2) the current chart pattern, and (3) picking
a good spot to buy or sell. Those are the three primary components of my trading. Way down in
very distant fourth place are my fundamental ideas and, quite likely, on balance, they have cost me
money.
By picking the right spot to buy, do you mean determining a reaction point at which you will
buy? If so, how do you avoid sometimes missing major price moves?
Oh no. If I were buying, my point would be above the market. I try to identify a point at which I
expect the market momentum to be strong in the direction of the trade, so as to reduce my probable
80



==================================================
                     PAGE 81                      
==================================================

risk. I don't try to pick a bottom or top.
Does that imply that if you are bullish, you will always wait for short-term strength before
entering a position, or will you sometimes buy on a reaction?
If I am bullish, I neither buy on a reaction, nor wait for strength; I am already in. I turn bullish at
the instant my buy stop is hit, and stay bullish until my sell stop is hit. Being bullish and not being
long is illogical.
Do you ever use contrary opinion as an aid to your trading?
Sometimes. For example, at a recent goldbug conference, virtually all the speakers were bearish. I
said to myself, "Gold is probably near a bottom." [The market did indeed rally after that
conference.]
Would you buy because of that type of input?
Oh no, the trend was still down. But it might get me to lighten up my short position.
What was your most dramatic or emotional trading experience?
Dramatic and emotional trading experiences tend to be negative. Pride is a great banana peel, as are
hope, fear, and greed. My biggest slip-ups occurred shortly after I got emotionally involved with
positions.
How about some actual "war stories"?
I prefer not to dwell on past situations. I tend to cut bad trades as soon as possible, forget them, and
then move on to new opportunities. After I bury a dead trade, I don't like to dig up the details
again—at least not in print. Maybe some evening, after dinner, sitting around a fire, off the record,
deep in the Tahoe winter...
Can you describe specific trading mistakes that you learned from?
I had a "thing" for silver for years. One of my first losses was in silver, as were many of my worst
losses. It seemed to get into my blood and hypnotize me. It inveigled me to pull my protective stops
so as to avoid getting bear-raided. Naturally, it would hold momentarily and then collapse some
more. I got killed so many times by silver spikes that I started thinking I was some kind of
werewolf. I worked on myself with hypnosis and positive imagery. I also avoided walks in the full
moon. So far it seems to be working.
How do you pick your trades?
Mostly by my trading system, although occasionally, I will get an impulsive flash and override my
system. Fortunately, I don't usually take on a big enough position to do any lasting damage to my
portfolio.
What are the elements of good trading?
The elements of good trading are: (1) cutting losses, (2) cutting losses, and (3) cutting losses. If you
can follow these three rules, you may have a chance.
How do you handle a losing streak?
I handle losing streaks by trimming down my activity. I just wait it out. Trying to trade during a
losing streak is emotionally devastating. Trying to play "catch up" is lethal.
Since you are primarily a systems trader, wouldn't following a system imply no changes of
trading activity during losing periods?
I have incorporated some logic into my computer programs, such as modulating the trading activity
depending on market behavior. Still, important decisions need to be made outside the mechanical
system boundaries , such as how to maintain diversification for a growing account when some
positions are at position limit or when markets are too thin.
Psychologically, I tend to alter my activity depending on performance. I tend to be more aggressive
after I have been winning, and less so after losses. These tendencies seem OK. In contrast, a costly
tendency is to get emotional over a loss and then try to get even with an overly large position.
Are you a self-taught trader, or did another trader teach you worthwhile lessons?
I am a self-taught trader who is continually studying both myself and other traders.

==================================================
                     PAGE 82                      
==================================================

Do you decide where you are getting out before you get in on a trade?
I set protective stops at the same time I enter a trade. I normally move these stops in to lock in a
profit as the trend continues. Sometimes, I take profits when a market gets wild. This usually
doesn't get me out any better than waiting for my stops to close in, but it does cut down on the
volatility of the portfolio, which helps calm my nerves. Losing a position is aggravating, whereas
losing your nerve is devastating.
What is the maximum percentage of equity you will risk on any individual trade?
I intend to risk below 5 percent on a trade, allowing for poor executions. Occasionally I have taken
losses above that amount when major news caused a thin market to jump through my stops.
What was your single worst "thin market" loss?
All markets are too thin when I want to get out of a bad position in a hurry. Most markets have, on
occasion, moved rapidly against me due to surprise news. As soon as the news is digested, the
market thickens up again at a new level. During the big sugar bull market when prices moved from
10 cents to 40 cents, I was carrying thousands of contracts and I gave up several cents getting out of
my position. [Each cent in sugar is equivalent to $1,120 per contract.]
Very few traders have enjoyed the spectacular success you have. What makes you different?
I feel my success comes from my love of the markets. I am not a casual trader. It is my life. I have a
passion for trading. It is not merely a hobby or even a career choice for me. There is no question
that this is what I am supposed to do with my life.
What are the trading rules you live by?
a. Cut losses.
b. Ride winners.
c. Keep bets small.
d. Follow the rules without question.
e. Know when to break the rules.
Your last two rules are cute because they are contradictory. Seriously now, which do you
believe: Follow the rules, or know when to break the rules?
I believe both. Mostly I follow the rales. As I keep studying the markets, I sometimes find a new
rale which breaks and then replaces a previous rale. Sometimes I get to a personal breakpoint.
When that happens, I just get out of the markets altogether and take a vacation until I feel that I am
ready to follow the rales again. Perhaps some day, I will have a more explicit rale for breaking
rales.
I don't think traders can follow rales for very long unless they reflect their own trading style.
Eventually, a breaking point is reached and the trader has to quit or change, or find a new set of
rales he can follow. This seems to be part of the process of evolution and growth of a trader.
How important to trading success is varying the size of the bet?
It might be a good idea depending on the reason for doing so. Consider, though, if you had a
successful modification policy, say "M" for changing system "S," then you might be better off just
trading "M."
How important is gut feel?
Gut feel is important. If ignored, it may come out in subtle ways by coloring your logic. It can be
dealt with through meditation and reflection to determine what's behind it. If it persists, then it
might be a valuable subconscious analysis of some subtle information. Otherwise, it might be a
dangerous sublimation of an inner desire for excitement and! not reflect market conditions. Be
sensitive to the subtle differences between "intuition" and "into wishing."
What was your worst year? What went wrong?
One of my worst years was 1980. The bull markets had ended, but I kept trying to hold on and buy
back in at lower prices. The markets just kept on breaking. I had never seen a major bear market
before, so I was all set up for an important educational experience.
What happened to the money management rules in your system in 1980? Did you override
82



==================================================
                     PAGE 83                      
==================================================

them?
I continued to trade even though my system was largely out of the markets due to the enormous
volatility. I tried to pick tops and bottom is in what I considered grossly overbought and oversold
markets. The markets just kept on going and I lost a lot. Eventually, I saw the futility of my
approach and quit for a while.
What is the most important advice you can give the average trader?
That he should find a superior trader to do his trading for him, and then go find something he really
loves to do.
Do you believe chart reading can be used for successful trading?
I consider trend following to be a subset of charting. Charting is a little like surfing. You don't have
to know a lot about the physics of tides, resonance, and fluid dynamics in order to catch a good
wave. You just have to be able to sense when it's happening and then have the drive to act at the
right time.
What was your personal experience in October 1987?
I made money on the day of the October 1987 crash. I also made money for the month as a whole,
and for the year, as well. I lost on the day after the crash, however, since I was short the interest
rate markets. Most trend traders were likely either out or short stocks and stock indexes during the
crash.
Are the markets different now than they were five to ten years ago because of the much
greater current participation by professional managers?
No. The markets are the same now as they were five to ten years ago because they keep changing—
just like they did then.
Does trading become more difficult as your size increases?
It becomes more difficult because it is harder to move large positions without moving the market. It
becomes easier because you have more access to competent people to support you.
What type of support do you mean?
A team of experienced brokers with professional attitudes. Experienced' traders can be very
supportive by just being there for sharing joys and sorrows. Also, the old-timers seem to be able to
smell the beginnings and endings of major moves. I also receive important support from my
friends, associates, and family.
Do you use any outside advisory services?
I keep track of a lot of outside advisers, mostly by reading the business press or hearing from my
brokers. The services usually break even, except when they start to gloat, then they are likely
headed for trouble.
How about market letters?
Market letters tend to lag behind the market since they generally respond to demand for news about
recent activity. Although there are certainly important exceptions, letter writing is often a beginning
job in the industry, and as such may be handled by inexperienced traders or non-traders. Good
traders trade. Good letter writers write letters.
Do you use the opinions of other traders in making trading decisions, or do you operate
completely solo?
I usually ignore advice from other traders, especially the ones who believe they are on to a "sure
thing." The old-timers, who talk about "maybe there is a chance of so and so," are often right and
early.
At what point did you get the confidence that you could keep on winning as a trader?
I vacillate between (a) "I can keep on winning," and (b) "I have just been lucky." I sometimes get
most confident of my ability just before a major losing streak.
How similar are the price patterns in different markets?
Common patterns transcend individual market behavior. For example, bond prices have a lot in
83



==================================================
                     PAGE 84                      
==================================================

common with the way cockroaches crawl up and down a wall. Unfortunately for cockroach
followers, there is usually no one around to take the other side of a trade.
Does the stock market behave differently from other markets?
The stock market behaves differently from all other markets and it also behaves differently from
the stock market. If this is hard to understand, it is because trying to understand the markets is a bit
futile. I don't think it makes any more sense trying to understand the stock market than trying to
understand music. A lot of people would rather understand the market than make money.
What do you mean, "The stock market behaves differently from the stock market"?
The stock market behaves differently from itself in that easily identifiable patterns seldom exactly
repeat.
What is your long-term outlook for inflation, the dollar, and gold?
Inflation is part of the way societies sweep away the old order. All currencies eventually get
debased—like it or not. Compute one penny invested at the time of Christ, compounded at 3
percent per year. Then consider why nobody has anywhere near that amount these days.
Gold tends to be dug up, refined, and then buried again. The geographical entropy of all gold on the
planet seems to decrease over time. A lot has been collected in vaults. I project the trend as one
toward a central world gold stash.
Do great traders have a special talent for trading?
Good traders have a special talent for trading just as good musicians and good athletes have talents
for their fields. Great traders are ones who are absorbed by the talent. They don't have the talent—
the talent has them.
What is the balance between talent versus work in trading success?
I don't know where one starts and the other stops.
How much of a role does luck play in trading success?
Luck plays an enormous role in trading success. Some people were lucky enough to be born smart,
while others were even smarter and got born lucky.
How about a serious answer?
"Luck" or "smarts" or "gift" are words indicating an attitudinal proclivity for mastery. One tends to
do well at one's calling. I think most good traders have a little extra spark about trading. Some
people are natural musicians or painters or salesmen or analysts. I think it is difficult to acquire
talent for trading. However, if it is already there, it can be discovered and developed.
What effect has trading had on your personal life?
My personal life is integrated with my trading life.
Is the joy of winning as intense as the pain of losing?
The joy of winning and the pain of losing are right up there with the pain of winning and the joy of
losing. Also to consider are the joy and pain of not participating. The relative strengths of these
feelings tend to increase with the distance of the trader from his commitment to being a trader.
When you made your first few million, did you lock some of it away to avoid the Jesse
Livermore experience? [Livermore was a famous speculator of the early twentieth century
who made and lost several fortunes.]
I feel the Livermore experience was a function of his psychology and had little to do with the
location of his assets. In fact, I remember reading that Jesse Livermore used to lock some of his
winnings away and then find a key when he needed to get at them. Therefore, locking up winnings
would be necessary to emulate his experience, not to avoid it. Furthermore, you would probably
also need to overtrade and have wipeouts, while you simultaneously fired up your emotions with
the burning desire to "win it right back." Acting out this drama could be exciting. However, it also
seems terribly expensive. One alternative is to keep bets small and then to systematically keep
reducing risk during equity drawdowns. That way you approach your safe money asymptotically
and have a gentle financial and emotional touchdown.

I notice there is no quote machine on your desk.
Having a quote machine is like having a slot machine on your desk— you end up feeding it all day
long. I get my price data after the close each day.
Why do so many traders fail in the marketplace?
For the same reason that most baby turtles fail to reach maturity: Many are called and few are
chosen. Society works by the attraction of the many. As they are culled out, the good ones are left,
and the others are released to go try something else until they find their calling. The same is true for
other fields of pursuit.
What can a losing trader do to transform himself into a winning trader?
A losing trader can do little to transform himself into a winning trader. A losing trader is not going
to want to transform himself. That' s the kind of thing winning traders do.
How would you rate the relative importance between psychology and market analysis to
successful trading?
Psychology motivates the quality of analysis and puts it to use. Psychology is the driver and
analysis is the road map.
You have focused a lot on the field of psychology. Can you tell by talking to a person whether
that person would probably be a winning or losing trader?
Yes, the winning traders have usually been winning at whatever field they are in for years.
What traits do you look for to identify the winning trader personality?
1. Не/she loves to trade; and
2. Не/she loves to win.
Don't all traders want to win?
Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market. Some people seem to like to lose, so
they win by losing money.
I know one trader who seems to get in near the start of every substantial bull move and works his
$10 thousand up to about a quarter of a million in a couple of months. Then he changes his
personality and loses it all back again. This process repeats like clockwork. Once I traded with him,
but got out when his personality changed. I doubled my money, while he wiped out as usual. I told
him what I was doing, and even paid him a management fee. He just couldn't help himself. I don't
think he can do it any differently. He wouldn't want to. He gets a lot of excitement, he gets to be a
martyr, he gets sympathy from his friends, and he gets to be the center of attention. Also, possibly,
he may be more comfortable relating to people if he is on their financial plane. On some level, I
think he is really getting what he wants.
I think that if people look deeply enough into their trading patterns, they find that, on balance,
including all their goals, they are really getting what they want, even though they may not
understand it or want to admit it.
A doctor friend of mine tells a story about a cancer patient who used her condition to demand
attention and, in general, to dominate others around her. As an experiment prearranged with her
family, the doctor told her a shot was available which would cure her. She constantly found excuses
to avoid appearing for the shot and eventually avoided it entirely. Perhaps her political position was
more important than her life. People' s trading performance probably reflects their priorities more
than they would like to admit.
I think that some of the most flamboyant and interesting traders are playing for more than profits
alone; they are probably also playing for excitement. One of the best ways to increase profits is to
do goal setting and visualizations in order to align the conscious and subconscious with making
profits. I have worked with a number of traders in order to examine their priorities and align their
goals. I use a combination of hypnosis, breathing, pacing, visualization, gestalt, massage, and so
forth. The traders usually either (1) get much more successful, or (2) realize they didn't really want
to be traders in the first place.
Surely, some people lose because they lack the skill, even though they really want to win.
It is a happy circumstance that when nature gives us true burning desires, she also gives us the
85



==================================================
                     PAGE 86                      
==================================================

means to satisfy them. Those who want to win and lack skill can get someone with skill to help
them.
I sometimes have dreams related to the impending direction of a market. Although these
dreams tend to be very infrequent, uncannily they often prove right. Have you had any
similar experiences?
I know several people who claim to have market insights during dreams. I think one of the
functions of dreams is to reconcile information and feelings which the conscious mind finds
intractable. For instance, I once told a lot of my friends that I expected silver to keep on going up.
When it went down instead, I ignored the signs and tried to tell myself it was just a temporary
correction. I stood to lose face and money. I couldn't afford to be wrong. Around that time, I had
dreams of being in a big, shiny, silver aircraft that stalled out and started going down toward an
inevitable crash. I eventually dumped my silver position, even went short, and the dreams stopped.
How do you judge success?
I don't judge success. I celebrate it. I think success has to do with finding and following one's
calling regardless of financial gain.
Don't be fooled by the humor in Seykota's comments; there is a great deal of serious wisdom in his
pithy replies. For me personally, the most striking comment was: "Everybody gets what they want
out of the market." When Seykota first made this remark, I thought he was merely being cute. But I
soon realized he was deadly serious. My reflexive response to this premise was disbelief: It implies
that all losers want to lose and all winners who fall short of their goals (like myself) are fulfilling
some inner need for a constrained threshold of success—a difficult proposition to swallow.
Although my rigidly logical mind would normally dismiss the idea, my respect for Seykota's
knowledge about markets and people forces me to consider the potential truth of the statement that
everybody gets what they want out of the market—a most provocative concept.

Larry Hite-Respecting Risk
Larry Hite's interest in the financial markets was sparked by a college course, but his path to Wall
Street was as circuitous as Moses' to the Land of Israel. His early adult years did not offer any clue
that this was a young man headed for eventual major success. First, his academic performance was
inauspicious. Then he went through a string of odd jobs, never managing to hold any for very long.
Eventually, he drifted into a dual career of actor and screenwriter. While not recording any major
successes, he managed to support himself, and enjoyed his work. One of his movie scripts, which
never found its way into production, was optioned so often that he began to view it as a source of
steady income.
One day, Hite heard H. L. Hunt on the radio describing how he made his fortune buying up lots of
cheap oil right options, which gave him the opportunity for occasional windfall profits with
minimal risk. That same night, Hite briefly met Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles, at a
party. The two ideas fused in his mind, leading to another career change. He thought to himself,
"Here is something [a rock promoter] that has the potential for making a lot of money with a
minimal investment." Although he landed a few record contracts for some of his groups, none ever
reached true stardom. Once again, although his success was limited, he managed to earn a
satisfactory living in a self- employed position.
Meanwhile, Hite's real interest remained in the financial markets. "You often hear about people
working on Wall Street to become screenwriters. I may be the only person who ever worked as an
actor and a scriptwriterto pay formy Wall Street career," he says jokingly. In 1968, Hite finally
decided to pursue his primary interest. While fascinated with the futures markets, he didn't have the
slightest idea how to break into that field, so he began as a stockbroker. Several years later, he
became a full-time commodities broker.
More than a decade passed before Hite, convinced that he had learned the ingredients necessary for
successful long-term trading performance, took the initial steps that led to the ultimate formation of
Mint Investment Management Company. He realized that his trading ideas needed to be subjected
to rigorous scientific testing. With an offer of partnership, but no immediate pay, he enlisted Peter
Matthews, who held a Ph.D. in statistics. One year later, he hired Michael Delman, a designer of
computer systems for a defense electronics firm. Matthews and Delman brought their own ideas to
the table, but perhaps even more significantly, their work provided the mathematical proof that
Hite's trading concepts were indeed statistically sound. Hite is emphatic that Mint's success would
not have been possible without Matthews and Delman.
Mint's objective was never to make the largest percentage return. Rather, Hite's philosophy was to
aim for the best growth rate consistent with extremely rigorous risk control. It is in this perspective
(return relative to risk) that Mint really shines. From the inception of trading in April 1981 through
mid-1988, Mint registered an average annual compounded return of over 30 percent. But it is their
consistency that is most impressive: their annual returns have ranged from a worst of plus 13
percent to a best of plus 60 percent. Their largest loss in any six-month period was only 15 percent
and under 1 percent in any twelve-month period (not just calendar years).
Not surprisingly, Mint's stellar performance has resulted in a spectacular growth of equity under
management. In April 1981, they began trading with $2 million; today, they manage over $800
million. Significantly, there is no evidence that the surge of money under management has had any
deleterious effect on performance. Hite believes that Mint can ultimately manage $2 billion—an
unprecedentedly large sum for a futures fund.
Our interview was conducted over lunch at Windows of the World atop New York's World Trade
Center, on a day it was blanketed with clouds. We took the hint when we were the last ones left in
the restaurant and finished the interview in Hite's office.
How did you first get interested in markets?
When I was in college, I took a business course with a professor who had a trenchant sense of
humor. To give you an example, he also worked as a bank examiner. One day, before leaving the
bank following an audit, he turned to the bank president and, as a joke, said, "Got you!" The man
had a heart attack on the spot. After that, they did another audit and found that the bank president
had embezzled $75,000. Anyway, in class one day, this professor is reviewing all the financial
87



==================================================
                     PAGE 88                      
==================================================

instruments: stocks, bonds, and so on. Then he says, "Now we come to the craziest market of all—
commodities. Thesepeople trade on only 5 percentmargin—and most of them borrow that." The
whole class laughed, except me. For some reason, the idea of trading on 5 percent margin made
perfect sense tome.
When did you first get involved in the financial markets?
Not until many years later. I was a rock promoter at the time, and on one weekend, there were three
separate shootings in clubs at which the groups I managed were working. I decided it was an
opportune time to change careers and pursue my true interest—the financial markets. Although I
was really interested in futures, I didn't have any idea how to look for a job in that field. So I
decided I would start out as a stockbroker.
My first interview was with a very old-line Wall Street firm, with offices that made you feel like
you should speak in hushed tones. The man who interviewed me was the kind of guy [he adopts a
pompously refined voice] who talks with his teeth together and lives in Connecticut. He tells me,
"We only buy blue chips for our clients."
Not having a financial background, I was unfamiliar with the term "blue chip," but it sounded odd
to me in the context of a staid investment firm. So after the interview, I looked up its derivation. I
found that the origin of the term could be traced to the color of the most expensive chip in Monte
Carlo. I said to myself, "Aha, now I know what this game is all about—gambling." I threw away
my copy of Graham and Dodd [Principles of Security Analysis, considered by many to be the
"bible" of stock market analysis] and bought a book called Beat the Dealer. I came away with the
idea that successful investment was really a matter of odds, and if you could compute the odds, you
could find and test methods that could beat the market.
What made you believe that you could develop methods to put the odds in your favor?
I don't know that I understood it all then, but over the years I came to realize that the markets are
inefficient. I have a friend who is an economist. He would try to explain to me, as if talking to a
child, why what I was trying to do was futile, because "the markets are efficient." I have noticed
that everyone who has ever told me that the markets are efficient is poor. He argued that if I could
develop a winning system on a computer, so could others, and we would all cancel each other out.
What is wrong with that argument?
Because people develop systems and people will make mistakes. Some will alter their system or
jump from system to system as each one has a losing period. Others will be unable to resist second-
guessing the trading signals. Whenever I go to a money management conference and sit down with
a group to have some drinks at night, I always hear the same story. "My system worked great, but I
just didn't take the gold trade, and that would have been my biggest winner."
There is a very important message here: People don't change. That is why this whole game works.
In 1637, tulips in Holland traded for 5,500 florins and then crashed to 50, a 99 percent loss. Well,
you might say, "Trading was relatively new then; these people were primitive; capitalism was still
in its infancy. Today we are much more sophisticated." So you go to 1929 and find a stock like Air
Reduction which traded at a high of $233 and after the crash fell to $31, a decline of 87 percent.
OK, you might say, "The Roaring '20s were crazy times, but now things are surely different." Move
ahead to 1961 and you find a stock called Texas Instruments trading at $207. It eventually dropped
to $49, a decline of 77 percent. If you think we have gotten more sophisticated in the 1980s, all you
have to do is look at silver prices, which in 1980 reached a peak of $50 and subsequently fell to $5,
a 90 percent decline.
The point is that because people are the same, if you use sufficiently rigorous methods to avoid
hindsight, you can test a system and see how it would have done in the past and get a fairly good
idea of how that system will perform in the future. That is our edge.
Isn't it possible that the markets can change and the future will be very different from the
past?
The markets may change, but people won't. When we were still in the testing stage, before we
actually started managing any money, my partner Michael Delman came up with the concept of
using holding periods as a measure of system performance. Evaluating systems solely on a calendar
88



==================================================
                     PAGE 89                      
==================================================

year basis is very arbitrary. What you really want to know are the odds for profitable performance
in a holding period of any length. In our simulations, Peter determined that 90 percent of all the six-
month holding periods, 97 percent of the twelve-month periods, and 100 percent of the eighteen-
month periods would be profitable. After over seven years of actual trading, the numbers turned out
to be 90 percent, 99 percent, and 100 percent.
I will tell you how confident I am of the future validity of our evaluation process. There is a fellow
who works for us who used to be a colonel in the British army. His service specialty was
dismantling bombs all over the world. I asked him, "How did you do it?" "It wasn't that difficult,"
he says. "There are different styles of bombs; a bomb in Malaysia is different from a bomb in the
Middle East. You go there and see what kind of bomb it is and take it apart." I said, "Let me ask
you a question. What happens when you come across a bomb that, you don't know?" He looks me
in the eye and says, "You record your first impression and hope it is not your last."
I came into the office one day and found this same steel-nerved individual virtually on the brink of
tears. I asked him what was wrong. It turned out that the Fed had made a major policy change,
which dramatically reversed many major market trends. Overnight, our fund, which had gone from
a starting value of $10 to nearly $15, had fallen back to under $12, just after he had opened a major
Swiss bank as an account. I told him, "Get them on the phone." "What?" he asked somewhat
confused. I repeated [speaking more slowly and emphatically], "G-e-t t-h-e-m o-n t-h-e p-h-o-n-e."
When I was a broker, my boss taught me that if you don't call your client when he is losing money,
someone else will. And, to be honest, when I was a broker, I did the same thing. When I called
prospects and they complained about their broker, I would say, "Oh, how could he put you in that
trade?"
So I get the account on the phone and explain that our simulations show that this type of event will
occur once every few years and that I am confident that in nine months the fund will be back to a
new high. "In fact," I said, "I have just borrowed some money to add to my own investment in the
fund." "You really did that?" he asked in a surprised tone. I assured him that I did.
Well, the account doubled up on their investment, and the fund immediately shot straight up. Today
that account is one of our biggest clients. How could I be so sure? I knew what those systems were
about. What makes this business so fabulous is that, while you may not know what will happen
tomorrow, you can have a very good idea what will happen over the long ran.
The insurance business provides a perfect analogy. Take one sixty-year-old guy and you have
absolutely no idea what the odds are that he will be alive one year later. However, if you take
100,000 sixty-year-olds, you can get an excellent estimate of how many of them will be alive one
year later. We do the same thing; we let the law of large numbers work for us. In a sense, we are
trading actuaries.
I have a friend who went broke trading futures. He can't understand how I can trade by following a
computerized system religiously. We were playing tennis one day and he asked me, "Larry, how
can you trade the way you do; isn't it boring?" I told him, "I don't trade for excitement; I trade to
win." It may be very dull, but it is also very lucrative. When I get together with other traders and
they start exchanging war stories about different trades, I have nothing to say. To me, all our trades
are the same.
There are many money managers who use trend-following systems—and quite a few of those
don't second-guess their own systems. What makes Mint different? How have you been able
to achieve return/risk ratios far above the industry average?
Because we know that we don't know. No matter what information you have, no matter what you
are doing, you can be wrong. I have a friend who has amassed a fortune in excess of $100 million.
He taught me two basic lessons. First, if you never bet your lifestyle, from a trading standpoint,
nothing bad will ever happen to you. Second, if you know what the worst possible outcome is, it
gives you tremendous freedom. The truth is that, while you can't quantify reward, you can quantify
risk. I will give you an example how important this advice is. One of the world's largest coffee
traders invited me to his house in London. When I walked into his library, I noticed he had just
about every book ever written on power. He took me to one of the finest restaurants I have ever
been at. At dinner, he asked me, "Larry, how can you know more about coffee than me? I am the
largest trader in the world. I know where the boats are; I know the ministers." "You are right," I
89



==================================================
                     PAGE 90                      
==================================================

answered, "I don't know anything about coffee. In fact, I don't even drink it." "How do you trade it
then?" he asked. I told him, " I just look at the risk." Well this great meal lasted for several hours.
Five times he asked me what I did, and five times I told him that I managed the risk.
Three months later I heard that he had blown $100 million in the coffee market. He obviously
didn't get the message. And you want to know something? He does know more about coffee than I
do. But the point is, he didn't look at the risk.
So the very first rale we live by at Mint is: Never risk more than 1 percent of total equity on any
trade. By only risking 1 percent, 1 am indifferent to any individual trade. Keeping your risk small
and constant is absolutely critical. For example, one manager I know had a large account that
withdrew half the money he was trading. Instead of cutting his position size in half, this manager
kept trading the same number of contracts. Eventually, that half of the original money became
lOpercent of the money. Risk is a no-fooling-around game; it does not allow for mistakes. If you do
not manage the risk, eventually they will carry you out.
The second thing we do at Mint is that we always follow the trends and we never deviate from our
methods. In fact, we have a written agreement that none of us can ever countermand our system.
The trades are all the same. That is the reason why we have never had a bad trade at Mint. There
are really four kinds of trades or bets: good bets, bad bets, winning bets, and losing bets. Most
people think that a losing trade was a bad bet. That is absolutely wrong. You can lose money even
on a good bet. If the odds on a bet are 50/50 and the payoff is $2 versus a $1 risk, that is a good bet
even if you lose. The important point is that if you do enough of those trades or bets, eventually
you have to come out ahead.
The third thing we do to reduce risk is diversify. We diversify in two ways. First, we probably trade
more markets worldwide than any other money manager. Second, we don't just use a single best
system. To provide balance, we use lots of different systems ranging from short term to long term.
Some of these systems may not be that good by themselves, but we really don't care; that is not
what they are there for.
The fourth thing Mint does to manage risk is track volatility. When the volatility of a market
becomes so great that it adversely skews the expected return/risk ratio, we will stop trading that
market.
Essentially, our approach has three lights in determining the acceptance of trading signals. When
the light is green, we take all signals. When the light is yellow, we will liquidate an existing
position on a signal, but we will not put on a new position. Finally, when the light is red, we
liquidate existing positions automatically, and we do not take any new positions.
For example, in 1986, when coffee went from $1.30 to $2.80 and back to $1.00, we got out of our
long positions on the way up at $1.70 and didn't trade the market for the rest of the price climb and
subsequent collapse. Now, while we may have lost some additional profits, being out of markets
like that is one of the ways we are able to achieve such rigid risk control.
So one of the key differences between you and other trend-following managers is that you
have developed a way of defining when not to play?
In any situation or game, you can define a positional advantage for any player—even the weakest
one. In trading, you can define three categories of players: the trade, the floor, and the speculator.
The trade has the best product knowledge and the best ways of getting out of positions. For ex-
ample, if they are caught in a bad position in the futures markets, they can offset their risk in the
cash market. The floor has the advantage of speed. You can never be faster than the floor. While
the speculator doesn't have the product knowledge or the speed, he does have the advantage of not
having to play. The speculator can choose to only bet when the odds are in his favor. That is an
important positional advantage.
You mentioned before that you used increased volatility as a signal to stop trading a market.
How many days of past data do you use to determine your volatility filter?
Anywhere from ten to 100 days.
When you say ten to 100, are you trying to be deliberately ambiguous or do you mean you use
different time frames within that range?
We look at different time windows in that range.
90



==================================================
                     PAGE 91                      
==================================================

I fully understand the logic of your 1 percent stop-loss rule. However, my one question is:
Once you are stopped out of a position without the system providing an opposite signal,*
what gets you back into the trade if the market reverses to its original direction? Isn't it
possible that you could get stopped out on a moderate price reaction and then miss a
subsequent major move?
If the market makes a new high, we get back in.
*For example, if a long position is stopped out on a money management rule without a sell signal
actually being generated, the system will still be in a long mode and no buy signal will be
generated, no matter how high prices go. (If, however, a sell signal were generated, the system
would begin monitoring for a buy signal.)
But suppose that the market goes into a wide trading range, might you not get continuously
whipped between being stopped out and reentering the position at new highs?
That happens, but not enough to be a problem.
You have an incredibly strong respect for risk. Were there any personal events in your
trading career that ingrained you with that attitude?
When I first became involved in commodities, I noticed that if you bought pork bellies in
September and sold them before July, you almost always made a profit. So I formed a fund with a
group of friends, and I put on this trade. It worked. I doubled the money. I felt like a genius.
At the time, I had a friend who followed the corn market. I didn't know anything about corn; I only
knew about pork bellies. He talked me into buying the new crop corn and selling the old crop.
Since this was supposed to be a relatively safe trade, in that I was offsetting my long position in one
contract month with a short position in another month, I really loaded up. Shortly thereafter, the
government released a surprising crop estimate. In response, the month I was long went limit-down
and the month I was short went limit-up.
I was in such despair that I remember walking out to the stairway and literally getting down on my
knees and saying out loud, "Dear God, I don't care how much I lose, but please don't let the account
go into a debit." At the time, I was working for a sophisticated international firm, and just as I was
making my providential plea, a Swiss banker came walking down the staircase. To this day, I still
wonder what he must have thought.
Were there any other personal traumatic experiences caused by a failure to heed market
risk?
Not for myself, but throughout my financial career, I have continually witnessed examples of other
people that I have known being ruined by a failure to respect risk. If you don't take a hard look at
risk, it will take you.
When I was a kid and got my first motorcycle, I had an older friend who would always get into
fights. He told me, "Larry, when you are on a motorcycle, never argue with a car. You will lose."
The same lesson applies to trading: If you argue with the market, you will lose.
The Hunt brothers are a perfect example. Somebody once asked me, "How could the Hunts lose?
They were worth billions." Let's say you have a billion dollars, and you buy $20 billion worth of
silver—I am making these numbers up for the sake of the example—you are in exactly the same
risk position as the guy with $1,000 who owns $20,000 worth of silver.
I have a good friend who started from very humble beginnings; his father was a sanitation man.
Anyway, he is a very bright guy and he got into option arbitrage. He was extremely good at it and
made a fortune. I remember visiting him at a palatial estate he bought in England.
Well, he may have been a great arbitrageur, but he turned out to be a bad trader. He developed a
trading system that made money. One day he said to me, "I am not taking the sell signal in gold; it
doesn't look right to me. Besides, almost 50 percent of the signals are wrong anyway." Not only
didn't he take the sell signal, he actually wound up going long. Sure enough, the market went down.
I told him, "Get out!" but he insisted, "The market will come back."
Well, he didn't get out, and he lost the mansion and everything else. Now he lives in a rented box
on a street with a hundred other ticky-tacky houses. To this day, I still remember the name of his
estate: "Beverly." He is still one of my best friends, and his loss of that huge house had an
enormous emotional impact on me. He had it and lost it all! And all because of one trade. The irony

==================================================
                     PAGE 92                      
==================================================

is that if he had followed his system, he would have made a fortune on that trade.
I will tell you another story. I have a cousin who turned $5,000 into $100,000 in the option market.
One day I asked him, "How did you do it?" He answered, "It is very easy. I buy an option and if it
goes up, I stay in, but if it goes down, I don't get out until I am at least even." I told him, "Look, I
trade for a living, and I can tell you that strategy is just not going to work in the long ran." He said,
"Larry, don't worry, it doesn't have to work in the long run, just till I make a million. I know what I
am doing. I just never take a loss." I said, "OK..."
In his next trade he buys $90,000 worth of Merrill Lynch options, only this time, it goes down, and
down, and down. I talk to him about one month later, and he tells me he is in debt for $10,000.1
said, "Wait a minute. You had $100,000 and you bought $90,000 in options. That should still leave
you with $10,000, even after they expired worthless. How could you have a deficit of $10,000?" He
said, "I originally bought the options at $4k. When the price went down to $1,1 figured out that if I
bought another 20,000, all it had to do was go back to $2^ for me to break even. So I went to the
bank and borrowed $10,000."
Respect for risk is not just a matter of trading; it applies to any type of business decision. I once
worked for a firm where the company president, a very nice guy, hired an option trader who was
brilliant, but not stable. One day the option trader disappeared, leaving the firm stuck with a losing
position. The president was not a trader, and he sought my advice. "Larry, what do you think I
should do?" I told him, "Just get out of the position." Instead, he decided to hold on to the trade.
The loss got a little worse, but then the market came back, and he liquidated the position at a small
profit.
After this incident, I told a friend who worked at the same firm, "Bob, we are going to have to find
another job." "Why?" he asked. I answered, "We work for a man who has just found himself in the
middle of a mine field, and what he did was close his eyes and walk through it. He now thinks that
whenever you are in the middle of a mine field, the proper technique is to close your eyes and go
forward. Less than one year later, this same man had to liquidate a huge delta neutral spread
position in options [a balanced position whose value will change very little for small price moves in
either direction]. Instead of just getting out, he decided to get out of the position one leg at a time.
By the time he finished liquidating that position, he had gone through all of the firm's capital.
Besides errors in risk control, why do people lose money trading?
Sometimes, because their trades are based on a personal bias, instead of a statistical approach. For
example, there is a regular panelist on "Wall Street Week" who is about sixty-five or seventy years
old. On the show one day, he said that the lesson his father taught him was, "Bonds are the
cornerstone of your portfolio." Think about that! Since this man first got into the business, he has
seen interest rates go down only once out of every eight у ears. [Bonds go up when interest rates
decline.] Obviously, the name "bonds" means a lot more to him than the reality.
You trade a very wide variety of markets. Do you trade them all the same way?
We don't trade markets, we trade money. Mickey Quenington, who is our marketing director, once
introduced me to a former chief executive of this firm [E. F. Man, the firm to which Hite gave 50
percent ownership in his management company in exchange for financial backing]. This guy was a
tough, old Irishman and he asked me, "How do you differentiate between gold and cocoa in your
trading?" I answered, "They are both a 1 percent bet; they are the same to me." He was outraged.
He practically shouted back at me, "You mean to tell me that you don't see any difference between
gold and cocoa?" I think if it wasn't for the fact that he liked Mickey so much, he would have
thrown me out of his office.
I married a very proper English woman who is always concerned that her family considers me a bit
crass. I was once interviewed by a reporter from the London Times, who asked me what I thought
about the future direction of the London cocoa market. I told him, "Frankly, I don't see markets; I
see risks, rewards, and money." I was the last person quoted in that article. He finished it by saying,
"Mr. Hite doesn't care about the cocoa market, all he cares about is money." My wife read the
article and said, "Great. Now I'll never be able to go home; this will just prove to my family that
they were right about you all along."
I assume that if you trade all markets the same, you probably don't believe in optimization.
92



==================================================
                     PAGE 93                      
==================================================

[Optimization refers to the process of testing many variations of a system for the past and
then selecting the best-performing version for actual trading. The problem with this fine-
tuned approach is that the link between past and future performance is often a very rough
one.]
Absolutely. We have a saying here: "It is incredible how rich you can get by not being perfect." We
are not looking for the optimum method; we are looking for the hardiest method. Anyone can sit
down and devise a perfect system for the past.
Are there any technical indicators that you have found to be overrated?
Overbought/oversold indicators. None of them seem to prove out in testing.
Any types of indicators you consider particularly valuable?
Although I don't really trade off of them, there are two that come to mind. First, if a market doesn't
respond to important news in the way that it should, it is telling you something very important. For
example, when the news of the Iran/Iraq war first came out over the newswire, gold was only able
to move up $1.1 said to myself, "A Middle East war has just broken out and the best the gold
market can do is go up $1; it has to be a great sale." The market broke sharply after that. The
second item is something that Ed Seykota taught me. When a market makes a historic high, it is
telling you something. No matter how many people tell you why the market shouldn't be that high,
or why nothing has changed, the mere fact that the price is at a new high tells you something has
changed.
Any other lessons that you learned from Ed Seykota?
Ed Seykota actually explained his philosophy one day: "You can risk 1 percent of your capital, you
can risk 5 percent, or you can risk 10 percent, but you better realize that the more you risk, the
more volatile the results are going to be." And he was absolutely right.
Besides your partners, who I know were integral in developing your trading systems, were
there any other traders who taught you valuable lessons?
Absolutely. Jack Boyd, who hired me as a broker/analyst. Having read that Handy and Harman had
said in their annual report that silver stocks totaled either three billion or seven billion ounces, I
wrote a report on the silver market in which I said, "According to Handy and Harman, there is
either twice as much silver as some people think or less than half." That report went over very big
with Jack and helped me land the job.
Jack had been putting out trading recommendations for his firm for many years. I found that if you
followed all of his recommendations, you would have made money in every year. Finally, I asked
Jack how he did it. You have to picture that Jack was six foot-four. He said, "Larry, if you want to
know where a market is going, all you have to do is this." He threw his charts on the floor and
jumped up on his desk. He said, "Look at it, it will tell you!"
I assume by that, he meant get a perspective of the big picture.
Right, because I don't know of too many people who get rich by taking small profits. Working with
Boyd was extremely important forme. From the time I met him, I knew that his approach was the
right way to do it. In other words, I knew that if you traded across the board, controlled your risk,
and went with the trend, it just had to work. I could see it absolutely clearly.
Any final words?
I have two basic rales about winning in trading as well as in life: (1) If you don't bet, you can't win.
(2) If you lose all your chips, you can't bet.
There are two basic elements to Hite's trading philosophy. First, contrary to the opinion of many
academics, Hite is firmly convinced that the markets are inefficient. This means that if you can
develop a method that places the odds in your favor (and it doesn't have to be by very much), you
can win. Second, an effective method is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to win. In order to
survive and thrive at trading, you also have to respect market risk. If you don't, sooner or later, it
will get you. Hite controls risk rigorously by applying four basic principles:
1. His system never trades counter to the market trend. There are no exceptions, and he always
follows the system.
93



==================================================
                     PAGE 94                      
==================================================

2. The maximum risk on each trade is limited to 1 percent of total equity.
3. Mint carries diversification to an extreme. First, their system is really a combination of many
different systems, selected not only for their individual performance, but also for their degree of
lack of correlation with other selected systems. Second, Mint trades in an extraordinarily wide
spectrum of markets (nearly sixty in all), encompassing exchanges in the U.S. and five foreign
countries and diverse market groups including stock indexes, interest rates, currencies, raw in-
dustrial goods, and agricultural commodities.
4. Volatility is continually tracked in each market in order to generate signals to liquidate or
temporarily suspend trading in those markets where the risk/reward ratio exceeds well-defined
limits.
One final observation: After merely earning a modest living at some colorful careers (such as,
scriptwriter, actor, rock promoter), Larry Hite succeeded spectacularly in the single endeavor for
which he had the greatest enthusiasm—fund manager. I found this to be a striking example of Ed
Seykota' s comment: "It is a happy circumstance that when nature gives us true burning desires, it
also gives us the means to satisfy them."

Michael Steinhardt-The Concept of Variant Perception
Michael Steinhardt's interest in the stock market dates back to his bar mitzvah, when his father gave
him 200 shares of stock as a present. He recalls hanging out in the local brokerage office as a
teenager, watching the ticker tape along with the old men, while his friends were out playing
stickball. A very bright student, Steinhardt completed his education at an accelerated pace,
graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1960 at the age of
nineteen. Steinhardt headed straight for Wall Street, landing his first job as a research assistant. In
subsequent years, he held positions as a financial journalist and a research analyst. In 1967, having
established a reputation as a talented analyst, Steinhardt and two other partners founded the
investment firm of Steinhardt, Fine and Berkowitz—the predecessor to Steinhardt Partners. (Fine
and Berkowitz left the firm in the late 1970s.)
In the twenty-one years since its inception, Steinhardt's firm has achieved a truly remarkable track
record. During that time, Steinhardt Partners has realized a compounded annual growth rate of over
30 percent (just under 25 percent after subtracting a 20 percent profit incentive fee). In comparison,
the S&P 500 index registered only an 8.9 percent compounded annual growth rate (dividends
included) during the same period. One thousand dollars invested with the firm at its start in 1967
would have grown to over $93,000 by Spring 1988 (after deducting prof it incentive fees). To put
that in perspective, the same $1,000 invested in a basket of S&P stocks would only have grown to
$6,400. Gain is only part of the story; Steinhardt's track record also demonstrates admirable
consistency. Steinhardt Partners has only witnessed two losing years. In both cases, the net loss was
under 2 percent before profit incentive fee adjustments.
Steinhardt's superior performance has been achieved by using a myriad of approaches. He is both a
long-term investor and a short-term trader; he is as comfortable shorting stocks as buying them; he
will shift major chunks of the firm's capital into other investment vehicles, such as treasury
securities, if he feels that is the best investment choice.
To be sure, Steinhardt Partners' track record is not a solo performance. In addition to his
cofounding partners, over the years, the firm has employed numerous traders and analysts.
However, there was never any doubt that Steinhardt was clearly in charge. He reviews the firm's
portfolio several times each day. Although he gives the firm's traders latitude to make their own
judgments, Steinhardt will require a trader to rigorously justify his position if he has qualms about
that position. If he feels strongly enough, Steinhardt will override the trader and liquidate the
position.
Steinhardt's extreme scrutiny and control of the firm's portfolio has given him a reputation of being
a very demanding man to work for— obviously, too demanding for many of the traders who have
left the firm over the years. Keeping in mind that Steinhardt's wraparound desk has been
constructed in the shape of a ship's bow, it is not surprising that one journalist doing a profile
tagged him with the sobriquet, Captain Ahab. However, Steinhardt's tough side is very much
related to his job role—much as in football coaching, toughness is probably a virtue in managing a
group of traders.
I never saw Steinhardt's tough side. The man I interviewed was relaxed, soft spoken, patient, and
good humored. (Of course, our interviews were always conducted outside of market hours.)
Steinhardt possesses a keen sense of humor. He has been known to call friends impersonating an
IRS agent, deliberately mumble fictitious orders to brokers right before the market close, and
double-talk in a Dr. Irwin Corey -like manner when he wishes to pull the leg of an analyst or
reporter who calls him. His conversation is also liberally sprinkled with Yid-dishisms—
"proprietary dreck," for example, is how he refers to newfangled fund products.
What are the major elements of your trading philosophy?
The word "trading" is not the way I think of things. I may be a trader in the sense that my frequency
of transactions is relatively high, but the word "investing" would apply just as much, if not more. In
my mind, trading implies an anticipation of a sale at the time of purchase. For example, if I go long
stock index futures tonight because I expect tomorrow's trade number will be bullish for the
market, and I plan to sell my position tomorrow—that is trading. The bulk of what I do is for a
much longer duration and for more complex reasons. For example, when I went long the debt

==================================================

markets in 1981, I held that position for two and a half years.
Well, for purposes of this book, I would still call what you are doing trading.
How then do you define the difference between trading and investing?
I make two key distinctions. First, a trader will go short as readily as long. In contrast, the
investor—for example, the portfolio manager of a typical mutual fund—will always be long. If he
is uncertain about the market, he may be only 70 percent invested, but he is always long. The
second distinction I make is that a trader is primarily concerned about the direction of the market. Is
the market, or stock, going up or down? The investor is more concerned about picking the best
stocks to invest in. There is no value judgment involved in my distinction between traders and
investors, it is merely a matter of maintaining a certain thematic focus for this book. In any case, on
both counts, I would certainly qualify you as a trader. To get back to my original question: How
would you define your philosophy of trading?
My particular style is a bit different from that of most people. Concept number one is variant
perception. I try to develop perceptions that I believe are at variance with the general market view.
I will play those variant perceptions until I feel they are no longer so.
Could you give me an example of variant perception in the current marketplace?
We have been short Genentech for a year and a half. There was a period of months and months
when we lost a lot of money in that position. But I stayed short because I continued to have a
variant perception about the future of their drug, TPA. [TPA can be injected intravenously to
dissolve blood clots.] It is our perception that, in a year or two, TPA will be a minor drug that will
be supplanted by more effective drugs that also cost substantially less. The thrust of the entire
company has been based on this one drug. If our perception is correct, this company will be earning
20 or 30 cents per share and selling for under $10. The stock is currently at $27 [June 1988], down
from a high of $65. [By late November, Genentech had fallen below $15 and Steinhardt was still
short.] But I think the general perception is still that Genentech is a first class biotechnology
company that will produce many products that are going to revolutionize the industry. As long as
my view is a variant perception, I will stay short.
That is a clear example, but it raises a question. Let's say you go short a stock because of your
variant perception, and the position goes against you. If the fundamentals don't change, the
more it goes against you, the more attractive the short side would appear. Yet from a money
management standpoint, at some point, the position would have to be covered. It seems like
there might be two basic trading principles in conflict here.
There are certain shibboleths that exist in the world of trading, which may or may not be accurate,
but I have not followed them. For example, there is a general view that you shouldn't short a stock
until it has already peaked and started down—that you shouldn't go short until the stock is already
reflecting problems that are evident for all to see. In some sense, I can understand that. Maybe that
is a superficially safer way to short stocks and you can sleep more comfortably using that approach.
However, I have never done it that way. My attitude has always been that to make money in the
markets, you have to be willing to get in the way of danger. I have always tended to short stocks
that were favorites and backed by a great deal of institutional enthusiasm. Generally speaking, I
have tended to short too early and, therefore, have usually started off with losses in my short
positions. If I short a stock and it goes up a lot, it may skew my exposure a bit, but as long as my
variant perception is unchanged, I'll stay short. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
Are you saying that as long as you think the fundamentals, as you perceive them, are
unchanged, you will hang tough no matter how much the position goes against you?
Right. Of course, if it is triple horrible, I might trade around the position to take the pressure down
a little bit. I would say, "OK, this looks awful; I see nothing but buyers. Why don't I join the buyers
and see if I can make some money." In a matter of speaking, I dichotomize myself. I have a
fundamental view, which I believe in my heart, but I try to separate that from the short-term fervor
and intensity I may see in the market. So even though I am short in that type of situation, I might
periodically be a buyer.

                     PAGE 98                      
==================================================

Might you actually go net long during those periods, or does your position just fluctuate
between fully short and flat?
It wouldn't even remotely approach flat, because that type of buying is based on very short-lived
perceptions. I might take 20,30, or 40 percent of the position and trade with it.
If you are very negative and short in a particular stock, but are not necessarily bearish on the
industry, might you sometimes hedge yourself by buying another stock in that group against
your short position?
I have tried that at times, but have generally found it to be unsuccessful. What it tends to do is give
me two problems instead of one. Usually, your knowledge about the second stock on the other side
will tend to be relatively skimpy because you are just grasping at it to use as a hedge. If your
problem is so great that you need to hedge it, why not address the problem directly rather than
taking on a totally separate position? Let's say you are short a paper stock and the paper stocks are
roaring, so you buy another paper stock against it. Maybe your short stock will go up more; maybe
the other stock will go up more. Who knows? If you have made a mistake, deal with the mistake;
don't compound it.
Besides the variant perception concept, what are some of the other elements of your trading
philosophy?
Nothing that is so distinctive. I don'tuse stop-loss orders or such. I don't use any rules about buying
on weakness or strength. I don't look at breakouts or breakdowns. I don't use charts.
You don't use charts at all?
Charts just leave me blank. [He adopts a Jackie Mason-like speech pattern.] I look at the stock. It
has a fantastic chart. The chart has a base like this, and then if it goes up a little bit more, boy it is a
real breakout, blah, blah, blah, blah. They all seem the same to me.
But just from an informational standpoint, don't you use charts as a quick and easy way to
see where a stock has traded over the years?
By watching stocks as closely as I do, I get some sense of price levels, uptrends, ranges, and all
that.
Let's say you know that a stock has gone from $10 to $40, wouldn't it matter to you how it
went from $10 to $40?
It makes no difference to me.
Do you have any trading rules that you could define?
Give me an example of a trading rale.
A common example might be: Before I get into a position, I know exactly where I am getting
out. It doesn't necessarily have to be a risk control rule, it could be—
No, I don't have any rules about stops or objectives. I simply don't think in those terms.
At this point, there is a call on the speakerphone. The caller is giving Steinhardt some late-breaking
news regarding a decision in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry. "The verdict is back. Everyone
was cleared except the Liggett group who had to pay a $400,000 fine and no punitive damages."
Steinhardt replies, "So it was basically a decision slightly in favor of the defendants."
I went short the tobacco stocks about a month ago. My reasoning was that if the plaintiffs won the
case, the stocks would go down a lot, but if the plaintiffs lost, the stocks wouldn't go up too much,
since the tobacco companies had never lost a case and winning another one wouldn't really be
news. That is an example of a variant perception. It will be interesting to see how much I will lose,
because my original theory was that it wouldn't be much. Here it is [reading story headline from
screen], "Liggett Group Found Liable for Contributing to Smoker's Death." You know what, I
won't lose anyway. A phrase like that will scare somebody.
Going back to our discussion, let's say you are short a stock because of your fundamental
analysis and the stock is going against you. How would you know when your analysis is wrong
because you have overlooked some unknown important element?
That situation happens fairly often. You buy or sell a stock and it doesn't act the way you think it
98



==================================================
                     PAGE 99                      
==================================================

should. I go through my portfolio six times a day. There are many stocks in the portfolio that I am
not directly responsible for. For example, someone else is short Time, Inc. They are short because
the magazine business is lousy, and this or that. But the stock is acting really strong and is up 10
percent from where we shorted it. I will go over to the person responsible for the Time Life
position and ask several key questions: When are we going to get something that is going to
surprise the world? When is something going to happen that will ease the feeling that this company
is ripe for a takeover?
In a sense, I am a negative monitor of the portfolio. If there is a problem with a position I will go
through it very regularly. That makes me a very difficult person here, because I only talk to people
when things are lousy or when their stocks are not acting like they should.
If a stock is not acting like it should based on its fundamentals, would that be the type of
market action that would change your thinking?
I try to assume that the guy on the other side of a trade knows as least as much as I do. Let's say I
buy Texaco at $52 and it suddenly goes down to $50. Whoever sold Texaco at $52 had a perception
that was dramatically different from mine. It is incumbent on me to find out what his perception
was.
What if you can't explain it?
The explanation might be superficial or serious, but you can usually get something.
Let's take the situation of the tobacco companies. On balance, the news that came out after
the close sounded bearish. If the tobacco stocks go down only modestly tomorrow and then
come right back, would you cover your position?
I would cover it anyway. I would cover the position on the news. So once the news is out, the game
is over for you. Right. That was the only reason I was short.
OK, that answers the question too simply. Assume you wanted to be short the tobacco stocks
as a longer-term position and the market shrugged off today's news and closed higher
tomorrow. Would you cover then?
It depends on my reasons. If I wanted to be short the tobacco companies because I felt tobacco
consumption was going to decline much more than presently perceived, it wouldn't matter that
much. If the market rallied tomorrow, I would have to take advantage of it and sell some more.
So you wouldn't care if the market didn't react to the news the way it should have, as long as
you felt the main reason for being short was still valid.
Yes, but if the news was terrible and the stocks were up, I would try to understand why. Sometimes
the market has more information and the variant action is really telling you something.
But haven't there been instances where your analysis was completely wrong?
Sure.
And you realized it somewhere down the road?
Yes, and not necessarily so quickly.
At this point, Steinhardt gets a phone call in which his side of the conversation is filled with non
sequiturs and deliberate mumbling. He then explains to me his occasional habit of playing practical
jokes on callers.
For example, I get a call from a broker who I haven't spoken to for a long time. I swoosh some
papers around and then say, "Buy 30,000 shares of ZCU [mumbles another sentence]." Did you
understand what I said?
No [I laugh].
That is exactly right, but it sounded legitimate didn't it? Anyway, he calls me back, and I have my
secretary tell him I'm in the bathroom. He calls back again, frantic because it is five minutes before
the close, and I am still unavailable. Then at 3:58,1 call him back and say, "Haven't you done that
order yet? What's the problem? Just do the damn thing!" Of course, he says, "I didn't catch the
name of the stock." So I tell him [he mumbles another sentence] and hang up before he can say
anything else.

==================================================

Your fund is often labeled as a hedge fund because it trades very differently than a typical
mutual fund. Could you elaborate on the meaning of a hedge fund.
The A.W. Jones Group has been given credit for being the first hedge fund. Originally, the term
referred to a precise concept, which essentially said the following: We in the world of money
management do not have the ability to forecast trends in the stock market, which are functions of a
host of variables that are largely beyond the consistent ability of individuals to anticipate. But, what
we as money managers can do, through careful analysis, is to make accurate judgments as to which
companies are doing well versus those that are not. So, if one balanced long positions in stocks that
were perceived to be relatively strong with short positions in stocks expected to act poorly, the
market risk would be totally eliminated. For example, if you loved Ford and hated General Motors,
and for every dollar long Ford you were short a dollar of General Motors, you might lose on your
shorts, but if your judgment was good, you would come out ahead. So, the original concept of a
hedge fund totally emphasized the ability to pick stocks.
Does anyone still trade that way?
No, today, the term hedge fund is somewhat of a misnomer. The term now refers to a limited
partnership in which the general partner is typically paid on a performance basis, as opposed to
more traditional money managers who are paid on assets managed. Typically, the manager of a
hedge fund has a great deal more flexibility than a traditional money manager, and that is really the
key element. That flexibility could include being able to short stocks as well as buy stocks, use
options, futures, and so on. That is what a hedge fund is in general terms, but the variations on the
theme cover a very wide continuum.
What happened to the original concept of a hedge fund?
The flexibility of the hedge fund structure attracted numerous young, aggressive entrepreneurs in
the 1960s because it allowed them an opportunity to start their own business at an early age in a
way that wasn't otherwise possible. Those were times of great stocks with wonderful stories. There
were quite a number of stocks showing terrific growth.
The people that came into the hedge fund business were not theoretical practitioners of the idea of
hedging, but were more interested in the idea of being their own bosses, and having the flexibility
to be long a lot of stock. Although they also had the flexibility of being short, they didn't use it in
any serious way. The word hedge has a very specific meaning in the English language. In most of
these hedge funds, you could seriously ask, "Where is the hedge?"
So they were hedge funds in name only?
Correct. They wouldn't even call themselves hedge funds; they were embarrassed by the name. The
term had a connotation of being short, and trading the short side had an anti-American ring to it. It
was as if you were rooting for disaster. So they started using the term [he adopts a tone of mock
pomposity] private partnership.
Ironically, today, with the disintegration of the relatively smooth secular trends of the 1950s
and 1960s, the concept of a true hedge fund may make more sense than it did in its early days.
Why aren't there any practitioners of the hedge fund concept in its pure form?
Because it is a very restricting approach. The premise of being a dollar long and a dollar short in
some related entity requires using a lot of dollars ineffectively. How different are Ford and General
Motors going to be? They are both affected by the same macroeconomic factors. If you have to put
up some dollars for the long and some dollars for the short, you may be lucky to realize a 10
percent difference over a period of a year—that is, assuming you are right.
There is a group we are associated with on the West Coast that specializes exclusively in shorting
stocks. The thought has been mentioned that maybe they should neutralize their market exposure
by being long an equal number of dollars in the stock indexes as they are short in individual stocks,
because what they bring to the party is the special ability to pick shorts. That is the closest thing to
this concept I have heard recently, but they don't do it.
How does your own fund fit into the hedge fund concept?
It fits in the sense that shorting is used actively. We always have some shorts. I also spend a good
deal of my time thinking about net market exposure and risk, and planning and adjusting for it. In
100



==================================================
                     PAGE 101                     
==================================================

the twenty-one years that I have been doing this, our overall exposure here has averaged about 40
percent.
You mean 40 percent net long?
Yes. In contrast, I would doubt that the most conservative of typical mutual funds has had an
average exposure of less than 80 percent during the last twenty years.
On average, you have been about 40 percent net long. What range does that encompass?
I remember being 15 or 20 percent net short at one point, and, at another time, being over 100
percent net long.
So you have the flexibility of being net short as well as net long?
Yes. One of the things I would emphasize about our approach is its flexibility to shift market
exposure so as to make it an exceptionally meaningful—sometimes perhaps too meaningful—tool
in our investment management arsenal.
How do you determine your outlook for the general market direction, since that is obviously a
very critical element of your approach?
It is really beyond definition, except to say that there are a host of variables, with some sometimes
more important than others, and they change all the time. Having done it as long as I have gives me
the opportunity to be 51 percent right rather than 50 percent right.
Does that imply that your main profitability comes from stock selection as opposed to net
exposure adjustments for anticipated changes in the broad market direction?
No, I was being a bit facetious. It is more than a 1 percent edge, but it is not a big advantage like
being right 80 percent of the time, or anything approaching that.
Relatively speaking, how important is the bias of the right market direction versus stock
selection as a contributing factor to your overall superior performance?
As I look back on the past twenty-one years, there is no set pattern of successful activity. In some
years, we did particularly well on the strength of a few well-chosen stocks. In other years, we did
exceptionally well because we were on the right side of the market. For example, in 1973-1974,
when the market went down enormously, we were up substantially, largely because we were net
short. There were other periods when the bulk of our money was made in bonds. I think there is a
message in the fact that there is no real pattern: Anyone who thinks he can formulate success in this
racket is deluding himself, because it changes too quickly. As soon as a formula is right for any
length of time, its own success carries the weight of its inevitable failure.
What made you sufficiently confident of lower stock prices to go net short in 1973-1974?
The anticipation of a recession.
Based on what?
I felt that the higher inflation rates of that period would lead to higher interest rates, which, in turn,
would slow down the economy.
Were you negative on the stock market in the period preceding the major 1982 bottom as
well?
Not as strongly. But in 1981 and 1982,1 made an enormous amount of money by having a
leveraged position in treasury notes. Although one couldn't predict the end of the rise of interest
rates timing-wise, it was clear that unless interest rates came down, other areas had to be relatively
unattractive. When you could get 14 percent in long-term treasury securities, in order to be
competitive, stocks had to sell so much lower than they were selling at that it wasn't even worth
focusing on which stocks to buy—although you might focus on the short side. What was unique in
that period was the inevitability of a turn in interest rates in order for anything else to be
worthwhile; it was simply a matter of timing that turn. In contrast to most other periods, this period
had a clear unidirectional message: U.S. Treasury fixed income securities were by far the
quintessential value of the time.
Anyone with any sense of contrarian mentality had to look at interest rates in the early 1980s as
presenting a potentially great opportunity. You knew the Fed would have to ease as soon as
101



==================================================
                     PAGE 102                     
==================================================

business started to run into trouble. In addition, we had already seen an important topping in the
rate of inflation.
So, some of the pieces of the puzzle were already in place?
Yes, and that is as much as you can hope for, because when they are all in place, it is too late.
You mention a contrarian mentality, but that type of thinking could have justified trying to
pick a top at much lower rates.
Absolutely. People think that being a contrarian implies victory. After all, what is a contrarian but
someone that goes against the crowd. It is almost a cliche that the crowd is always wrong—so the
guy who stands against the crowd must always be right. Well, life doesn't work that way. There
were plenty of contrarians who bought bonds when interest rates went to 8 percent for the first
time, and 9 percent, and 10 percent. There was a great deal of money lost by people buying bonds
at what were then all-time high yields.
There is a very important difference between being a theoretical contrarian and dealing with it in
practical terms. In order to win as a contrarian, you need the right timing and you have to put on a
position in the appropriate size. If you do it too small, it's not meaningful; if you do it too big, you
can get wiped out if your timing is slightly off. The process requires courage, commitment, and an
understanding of your own psychology.
I assume that you probably had the market run against you for quite a while in that trade.
Right, it did. It was a very painful period, because as far as most of my investors were concerned, I
was an equity investor. What did I know about bonds? Who was I to contradict Henry Kaufman
who was telling the world that interest rates were going to the moon? Not only was I doing
something that was different than in the past, which always raises the antennas of investors—
particularly those with an institutional mentality—but I was doing it in an enormous size.
Were you leveraged more than 100 percent on your position?
Yes, at one point I had three to four times the firm's capital in five-year maturities. In stocks, you
have a policeman who tells you how much you can speculate: it is called margin requirements. But
in treasuries, you can finance as much as 98 percent of your purchases, depending on maturity, so
there is no real constraint.
How long was the period between when you started buying treasuries and the market bottom
[interest rate peak]?
I started buying in the spring of!981,andl think treasuries bottomed on September 30,1981.
How much did rates move against you in that first half year?
I don't recall, but rates went up enough to be painful, especially given the size of my position.
Up until this time, you had primarily been a stock trader. Here on your first major foray in
treasuries, you started out by incurring substantial losses. Didn't you have periods of self-
doubt?
All the time. The summer of 1981 was the worst experience of my business life. A number of
thoughtful, intelligent investors were really very unhappy with what I was doing—and I wasn't so
sure myself.
Did you ever come close to saying, "Maybe I am wrong," and liquidating, or at least
decreasing, your position?
No, never.
One of your basic principles seems to be that as long as you believe you are fundamentally
right, you will stay with a position. Have there been any exceptions—that is, markets in which
you didn't change your fundamental view, but the loss just got too big?
There have been some situations when I was short and simply didn't have enough courage to hang
in with the full-boat of the position. That was particularly true in 1972, at the height of the "Nifty-
Fifty" phenomenon. With the exception of October 1987, that was probably the worst period in my
investment life. At the time, there was a theory that as long as a company continued to sustain
substantially above-average secular growth, it didn't matter how much you paid for it. Many growth

==================================================

stocks traded at multiples that were just crazy. We went short Polaroid when it was selling at sixty
times earnings, which we thought was absurd; it then went to seventy times earnings. The market
seemed to lose track of reality, and we found ourselves asking, "What is the difference between
forty times earnings and eighty times earnings?" By putting a different number on the secular
growth rate estimate, you could justify almost any multiple That is how people were thinking in
those days.
So you backed off during that period?
At times we did, because we were losing a lot of money.
Did that prove to be the right move, because stocks eventually went to much higher multiples,
or would you have been better off if you had held on?
In hindsight, in almost all cases, I would have been better off sticking it out.
You mentioned that October 1987 was one of the worst market experiences in your career.
Obviously, you had lots of company. But I find it surprising, you being such a contrarian. I
wouldn't have expected you to be heavily long in a year with such bullish euphoria. What
happened?
Actually, in the spring of 1987,1 wrote a letter to my investors stating the reasons why I was
cautious and substantially reducing my exposure in the market. Having done that, I kept thinking
about why the market was trading at a level that was too high by historic standards I came to the
conclusion that the quintessential issue was a unique combination of phenomena occurring in the
American equity markets—a substantial continuous reduction in the amount of equities
outstanding, coinciding with a more liberal attitude toward debt. As long as banks were comfort-
able lending money, the junk bond market was good, and corporate managers saw repurchasing
their shares as the right thing to do, I felt there would be an unusual upward bias to equity prices.
That to me was the single most important reason in the seeming overvaluation of stocks that existed
through most of 1987.
Therefore, the important question was: What was going to change this situation? The answer was a
recession. And whenever that recession would come, its impact would be horrendous because the
government didn't have the flexibility to fight it since they had deviatsd from a countercyclical
fiscal policy during the expansion phase. But during the fall of 1987, not only was the economy not
weakening, it was strengthening—so much so that the Fed tightened.
What I didn't anticipate was that less-than-dramatic events could have as large an impact on the
market as they did. What was the real importance of the Fed tightening? Ordinarily, that might have
created a 100- or 200-point decline in the stock market, but not a 500-point decline. In the light of
history, what was the significance of Treasury Secretary Baker's criticism of Germany? It was
merely a disagreement as to the proper valuation of currencies—hardly a unique event. In
retrospect, what happened to the real world after October 19? Almost nothing. So, in some sense,
you have to conclude that this problem was internal to the market; it wasn't that the market was
forecasting an imminent financial debacle or great recession.
How then do you explain the extreme nature of the October 19 price break?
The problem that led to the October 19 collapse was the combination of relatively modest real
world changes and an inability of the markets' mechanism to deal with the institutional changes that
occurred mostly during the 1980s. The elements of stability—the individual investor and the
specialist system—had been greatly reduced in importance.
Do you believe portfolio insurance exacerbated the decline? [Portfolio insurance is the
systematic sale of stock index futures to reduce the risk exposure in a stock portfolio as prices
decline. See Appendix 1 for more detail.]
That was one of the new elements. On one hand, you had a reduction in the elements of stability.
On the other hand, you had the creations of the 1980s—portfolio insurance, program trading, and
global asset allocation—which tended to exert a unidirectional impact. By that, I mean that
participants in these strategies tend to be buyers and sellers at the same time. The stock market was
not prepared to handle it.

==================================================

Where were you, position wise, coming in on October 19?
I came in very much long exposed—80 to 90 percent—and I increased my exposure during the day.
Why? Were you still bullish?
My increasing exposure was strictly a contrarian trade in the sense that when the markets have an
enormous move, most of the time, it is right to take the view that there is a lot of emotionalism and
extremism in that move. If you can maintain a bit of distance from the emotionalism, you tend to do
well. So my buying that day is what I would have done on any 300-, 400-, or 500-point down day.
Did you stay with your long position?
No, I reduced it throughout the next two months. The magnitude of the decline and the
extraordinary change in confidence that it engendered affected me as well. I thought it was better to
sit back and rethink the situation with a lot of cash rather than try to hang in.
Did you think that your basic premise for being long was no longer valid?
I thought that I had underestimated the impact of the forces that had diminished market stability.
What was your percentage loss during October 1987?
I was down over 20 percent for the month.
As you look back on the October 1987 experience, are there mistakes that you believe you
learned from?
There is a very good investor I speak to frequently who said, "All I bring to the party is twenty-
eight years of mistakes." I really believe he is right. When you make a mistake, there is some
subconscious phenomenon that makes it less likely for you to make that same mistake again. One
of the advantages of trading the way I do—being a long-term investor, short-term trader, individual
stock selector, market timer, sector analyst—is that I have made so many decisions and mistakes
that it has made me wise beyond my years as an investor.
The typical mutual fund adheres to a buy-and-hold approach. Do you think that concept is
basically a flawed strategy?
Yes, although flawed isn't quite the word I would use. I would say it is too limiting a strategy. The
objective of participating in the long-term growth of American equities, willing to suffer through
those periods when equities decline, is fine, but it leaves so much on the table in terms of potential
professional management. It is an incomplete strategy.
Yet, the vast majority of all funds fall into that category.
I guess so, but less than before. More and more people are paying attention to market timing, not
that they are necessarily qualified to do it terribly well, but because they have come to recognize
what a buy-and-hold approach means. When I was a kid, it was common advice to buy a stock, put
it in a vault, and forget about it. You don't hear that sort of concept anymore. We have lost
confidence in the long term.
Do you think the mutual fund industry is going to change?
The mutual fund industry is certainly sensitive enough to the whims of the investing public to find
products that will meet contemporary needs.
How do you handle a losing period?
As is true for so many other questions in this business, there is no pat answer or formula. There is
nothing that can be articulated precisely enough to lead others in a certain direction.
In other words, one losing period may be sufficiently different from another so that, even for
yourself, there may be no general wisdom that applies.
Correct.
How did you get started as a fund trader?
When I first got into this business in the late 1960s, I only had an analytical background. I was an
agricultural equipment and cyclical goods analyst at Loeb Rhoades. My business was started with
two other fellows who were also analysts. As our business grew, trading became more important. I
became the trader for the firm, having had very little trading background.

==================================================

If you had very little experience, why did you become the trader?
I probably wasn't as good an analyst as the other two.
Even in those early years, you did very well as a trader. How do you think you managed that
without benefit of experience?
My father has been a gambler all his life. Although I can't remotely justify it, I feel there is an
element of gambling in this business. Maybe I got that talent from my father.
You have traded the stock market for over twenty years. Have you noticed any significant
changes during that time?
The amount of intellectual power on the trading desks twenty years ago was minimal compared to
today. The institutional traders were typically kids from Brooklyn, who could hardly speak the
language, made a minimum amount of money, and had very little discretion. So when I first started
trading, it was like taking candy from a baby.
I remember once a trader needed to sell 700,000 shares of Penn Central. At the time, the stock was
already in Chapter 11. The last trade was at 7, and the seller didn't bother to check the board. I
bought 700,000 shares at 6'/ . The seller was relieved to sell that amount of stock at less than a
8
dollar under the last trade. Meanwhile, I turned around and sold the 700,000 shares at 61.1 could
have sold three times that amount at that price. I made a half million dollars on that trade, and it
took me all of twelve seconds.
How long did that environment last?
Until the consolidated tape in 1975. Now there is a lot more competition; the people on the trading
desks are much brighter. Another change is that retail buyers and sellers have diminished greatly in
importance. The market has become institutionalized. Individuals buy stock through mutual funds.
Brokerage firms don't sell customers stocks so much as they sell those horrible mutual funds and
other awful things they call "financial products."
Perhaps the most important change is that the world has become much more short term oriented.
All sorts of people who used to be investors are now traders. The institutions now define
themselves as enterprises whose goal is to achieve the highest rate of return, when they used to
define themselves as long-term investors. People's confidence in their ability to predict secular
trends has greatly diminished. In 1967, it would be typical to see a report by a brokerage firm
estimating McDonalds' per share earnings up to the year 2000. Those people thought they could
estimate long-term earnings because companies were growing in a stable and predictable way.
They believed in America and steady growth. Today, stocks don't lend themselves to the same type
of secular analysis.
The implication of secular growth trend analysis not having worked in the 1970s and 1980s relates
to the question of trading. In the 1950s and 1960s, the heroes were the long-term investors; today,
the heroes are the wise guys. There are people like Goldsmith, who lauds the virtues of capitalism.
He talks about "what I did for Goodyear." What did he do for Goodyear? He was in there for seven
months, made eight zillion dollars for himself, and left the management after taking greenmail. He
talks about what he did for Goodyear, because he is uncomfortable and has to somehow associate
himself with the capitalist process. He and these other people have to bitch and moan about
management, but they don't know their ass from their elbow about running companies. With the
breakdown of certain laws, people are allowed to do things they weren't allowed to do before.
What laws are you referring to?
The Justice Department's reinterpretation of takeover laws; the definition of what is and is not
monopolistic.
What would be the most important advice you could give to the layman?
One of the allures of this business is that sometimes the greatest ignoramus can do very well. That
is unfortunate because it creates the impression that you don't necessarily need any professionalism
to do well, and that is a great trap. So the major advice I would give anybody is: Recognize that this
is a very competitive business, and that when you decide to buy or sell a stock, you are competing
with people who have devoted a good portion of their lives to this same endeavor. In many in-
stances, these professionals are on the opposite side of your trades and, on balance, they are going

==================================================
                     PAGE 106                     
==================================================

to beat you.
Is the implicit message that, most of the time, the novice trader would be better off having his
money professionally managed?
The term professionally managed implies a credit I am not sure I would give the average
professional in this business. My point is that you should have a good reason to assume that you are
going to achieve a significantly superior return for investing in stocks. If you can get 9 percent or
10 percent by investing in T-bonds and 7 percent or 8 percent by investing in T-bills, what should
you get in stocks to offset the incremental risk? Probably something much higher. You have to
decide what that number should be, and whether you have a realistic chance of achieving it.
Don't underestimate the difficulty of the game.
Right, and forget the shibboleth that stocks are going to give you a higher rate of return because
they are more risky. That is not true. They are more risky; therefore, you have to be convinced that
you are going to get a higher rate of return in order to play the game. Don't assume that by
investing in some mutual fund, you are going to get a higher rate of return.
Isn't that true, though? Historically, hasn't the stock market significantly beat interest rate
returns?
True, but there is a lot of statistical mumbo jumbo involved. Average return calculations depend
heavily on the starting date. If you start in 1968 or 1972, for example, the numbers look a lot less
appealing.
What are the elements of good trading?
Good trading is a peculiar balance between the conviction to follow your ideas and the flexibility to
recognize when you have made a mistake. You need to believe in something, but at the same time,
you are going to be wrong a considerable number of times. The balance between confidence and
humility is best learned through extensive experience and mistakes. There should be a respect for
the person on the other side of the trade. Always ask yourself: Why does he want to sell? What
does he know that I don't? Finally, you have to be intellectually honest with yourself and others. In
my judgment, all great traders are seekers of truth.
Steinhardt's variant perception is basically a contrarian approach. But you can't be a successful
contrarian by just using sentiment survey numbers or other measures of bullish consensus. The
markets don't pay off that easily. Although sentiment is always very bullish at tops and very bearish
at bottoms, unfortunately, extreme bullish and bearish readings are also characteristic of extended
trends. The trick is not being a contrarian, but being a contrarian at the right time. Such judgments
cannot be made on the basis of simple formulae. The successful contrarian needs to be able to filter
out the true opportunities. Steinhardt's filters are a combination of a keen sense of fundamentals
and market timing.
Flexibility is another essential key to Steinhardt's extremely favorable return/risk performance
characteristics. This flexibility is demonstrated by the equal ease at which he goes short or long, as
well as his willingness to trade markets other than stocks when warranted by his perception of the
fundamentals. "The more things you bring to the table—shorting, hedging, participation in bond
markets, futures market trading, and so on—the better off you are," he says.
One trait I have noticed among a number of the great traders is their willingness and ability to take
on a particularly large position when they perceive a major trading opportunity. The nerve and skill
required to step on the accelerator at the right time is certainly one of the elements that separates
good traders from exceptional traders. Steinhardt's heavy position in treasury notes during 1981 and
1982 is a perfect example of this characteristic.
Conviction is probably an important quality for any trader, but it is essential to the contrarian
trader. Steinhardt has repeatedly demonstrated amazing resolve in maintaining large positions
during difficult times, as long as he was convinced he was still right. Witness his conviction in
staying with his treasury note position during the six-month climax in interest rates in 1981,
remaining immune not only to the market move against him, but also to the psychological pressures
of complaining investors who questioned his sudden transition into treasuries after a career as a
stock trader. Throughout it all, Steinhardt held on, and even built his position, because he remained

==================================================

convinced that he was right. Without his strong sense of conviction, the world probably would
never have heard of Michael Steinhardt.
Steinhardt also stresses that there are no absolute formulae or fixed patterns. The markets are
always changing, and the successful trader needs to adapt to these changes. In Steinhardt's view,
traders who try to find fixed approaches will be doomed to failure sooner or later.

William O'Neil-The Art of Stock Selection
William O'Neil is an unreserved optimist and ebullient fan of the American economic system and
its possibilities. O'Neil says, "Great opportunities occur every year in America. Get yourself
prepared and go for it. You will find that little acorns can grow into giant oaks. Anything is
possible with persistence and hard work. It can be done, and your own determination to succeed is
the most important element."
O'Neil is living proof of his own words: a classic American success story. Born in Oklahoma
during the lean Great Depression years and raised in Texas, he went on to build dual fortunes as
both an immensely profitable investor and a highly successful businessman.
O'Neil began his financial career as a stockbroker for Hayden, Stone and Company in 1958. It was
there that he first began the research that led to the formulation of the key elements of his
investment strategy. O'Neil's trading concepts proved remarkably effective from the start. During
1962-63, by pyramiding the profits in three exceptional back-to-back trades—short Korvette, long
Chrysler, and long Syntex—he managed to parlay an initial $5,000 investment into $200,000.
In 1964, O'Neil used his investment winnings to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and
to form William O'Neil and Co., an institutional research brokerage firm. His firm was a leader in
offering comprehensive computerized stock market information and today is one of the most highly
respected securities research firms in the country. William O'Neil and Co. services more than 500
major institutional accounts and 28,000 individual subscribers to their Daily Graphs charting
service. The firm's data base contains 120 different statistics on each of 7,500 securities.
In what was certainly his boldest endeavor, in 1983, O'Neil launched Investor's Daily in direct
competition with the Wall Street Journal. He financed the newspaper with his own funds, knowing
that it would be many years before he could hope to break even. Skeptics abounded when the paper
began with a press run under 30,000 in 1984, compared to over two million for the Wall Street
Journal. By mid-1988, Investor's Daily's subscribership had expanded to over 110,000, and the
growth in circulation was accelerating. The estimated breakeven point of 200,000 subscribers no
longer seems far-fetched. O'Neil believes Investor's Daily can eventually grow to 800,000 readers.
His unflagging confidence in the paper stems from the fact that Investor's Daily's financial tables
contain statistical information unavailable anywhere else— earnings per share (EPS) rank, relative
strength, and volume percent change. (These measures are discussed in the interview.)
In 1988, O'Neil combined his concepts in the book How to Make Money in Stocks, published by
McGraw-Hill. The book combines clarity and brevity with excellent and very specific trading
advice. It was the best-selling investment book of the year.
O'Neil's various business ventures have not impeded his performance as a virtuoso stock investor.
During the past ten years, O'Neil has averaged over a 40 percent profit annually on his stock
investments. Some of his biggest winners were the Canadian oils during the 1970s and Pic'n'Save
and Price Co. during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Perhaps O'Neil's most famous market calls
were two full-page Wall Street Journal ads heralding imminent major bull markets. The timing of
these ads could hardly have been better: March 1978 and February 1982.
William O'Neil and Company is a no-frills operation. Rarely have I seen a more crowded office
environment. O'Neil, however, does not single himself out for any special privileges. In what must
surely be a rarity among chief executive officers, he shares his office with two other employees.
O'Neil impressed me as being articulate, confident, opinionated, and very bullish on America.
I think it would be fair to describe your stock investment approach as individualistic and
original. Where did you first develop your trading ideas?
I went through the same process that most people do. I subscribed to a few investment letters and
most of them didn't do too well. I found that theories like buying low-priced stocks or stocks with
low price/earnings (P/E) ratios were not very sound.
When did you first find an approach that worked?
Back in 1959,1 did a study of the people that were doing very well in the market. At that time, the
Dreyfus fund was a very small fund, managing only about $15 million. Jack Dreyfus, who managed
the fund, was doubling the results of all of his competitors. So I got copies of their prospectus and
108

                     PAGE 109                     
==================================================

quarterly reports and plotted on charts precisely where they had purchased each of their stocks.
There were over 100 of these securities and when I laid them out on a table, I made my first real
discovery: Not some, not most, but every single stock had been bought when it went to a new high
price.
So the first thing I learned about how to get superior performance is not to buy stocks that are near
their lows, but to buy stocks that are coming out of broad bases and beginning to make new highs
relative to the preceding price base. You are trying to find the beginning of a major move so that
you don't waste six or nine months sitting in a stock that is going nowhere.
I studied the stocks that were big winners in past years and tried to find the characteristics they had
in common before they became major successes. I didn't just limit myself to preconceived notions
like P/E ratios; I examined a lot of variables to develop a model based on how the real world
worked.
Can you describe this model for picking winning stocks?
I use the easy-to-remember acronym CANSLIM. Each letter of this name represents one of the
seven chief characteristics of the all-time great winning stocks during their early developing stages,
just before they made huge advances.
The "C" stands for current earnings per share. The best performing stocks showed a 70 percent
average increase in earnings for the current quarter over the same quarter in the prior year before
they began their major advance. I am continually amazed by how many individual investors, and
even pension fund managers, buy common stocks with unchanged or lower current quarter
earnings. There is absolutely no reason for a stock to go up if the current earnings are poor. If, as
our research demonstrated, the best stocks had large profit increases before they advanced rapidly
in price, why should anybody settle for mediocre earnings? So, our first basic rule in stock selection
is that quarterly earnings per share should be up by at least 20 to 50 percent year to year.
The "A" in our formula stands for annual earnings per share. In our studies, the prior five-year
average annual compounded earnings growth rate of outstanding performing stocks at their early
emerging stage was 24 percent. Ideally, each year's earnings per share should show an increase
over the prior year's earnings.
It is a unique combination of both strong current earnings and high average earnings growth that
creates a superb stock. The EPS rank, which is published in lnvestor's Daily, combines a stock's
percent earnings increase during the past two quarters with the past five-year average percent
earnings and compares that figure to every other stock we cover. An EPS rank of 95 means that a
company's current and five-year historical earnings have outperformed 95 percent of all other
companies.
The "N" in our formula stands for something new. The "new" can be a new product or service, a
change in the industry, or new management. In our research we found that 95 percent of the
greatest winners had something new that fell within these categories. The "new" also refers to a
new high price for the stock. In our seminars we find that 98 percent of investors are unwilling to
buy a stock at a new high. Yet, it is one of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems
too high usually goes higher and what seems too low usually goes lower.
The "S" in the formula stands for shares outstanding. Ninety-five percent of the stocks that
performed best in our studies had less than twenty-five million shares of capitalization during the
period when they had their best performance. The average capitalization of all of these stocks was
11.8 million shares, while the median figure was only 4.6 million. Many institutional investors
handicap themselves by restricting their purchases to only large-capitalization companies. By doing
so, they automatically eliminate some of the best growth companies.
The "L" in our formula stands for leader or laggard. The 500 best-performing stocks during the
1953-1985 period had an average relative strength of 87 before their major price increase actually
began. [The relative strength measures a stock' s price performance during the past twelve months
compared to all other stocks. For example, a relative strength of 80 would mean that the given
stock outperformed 80 percent of all other stocks during the past year.] So, another basic rule in
stock selection is to pick the leading stocks—the ones with the high relative strength values—and
avoid the laggard stocks. I tend to restrict purchases to companies with relative strength ranks
above 80.
109



==================================================
                     PAGE 110                     
==================================================

The "I" in the formula stands for institutional sponsorship. The institutional buyers are by far the
largest source of demand for stocks. Leading stocks usually have institutional backing. However,
although some institutional sponsorship is desired, excessive sponsorship is not, because it would
be a source of large selling if anything went wrong with the company or the market in general. This
is why the most widely owned institutional stocks can be poor performers. By the time a company's
performance is so obvious that almost all institutions own a stock, it is probably too late to buy.
The "M" in our formula stands for market. Three out of four stocks will go in the same direction as
a significant move in the market averages. That is why you need to learn how to interpret price and
volume on a daily basis for signs that the market has topped.
At any given time, less than 2 percent of the stocks in the entire market will fit the CANSLIM
formula. The formula is deliberately restrictive because you want to pick only the very best. If you
were recruiting players for a baseball team, would you pick an entire lineup of .200 hitters, or
would you try to get as many .300 hitters as possible?
Since you use such a restrictive selection process, do you have a high percentage of winning
trades?
I guess over the years, about two-thirds of my stock purchases were actually closed at a profit.
However, I have found that only one or two stocks of every ten I have bought have turned out to be
truly outstanding.
Wouldn't most of the indicators in your CANSLIM formula, such as EPS, pick up a stock
before it goes to new highs? Why not just buy the stock when it is still forming a base instead
of waiting for it to go to a new high?
You don't want to anticipate a breakout from a base because a stock may never break out. You can
buy too soon as well as too late. The idea is to buy when there is the least probability of a loss. If
you buy within the base, the stock will frequently fluctuate 10 or 15 percent in normal trading
action, and it is very easy to get shaken out of the position. But if I buy at exactly the right time, the
stock is usually not going to go down to my maximum 7 percent stop-loss point.
You have stated that the superior stocks have high relative strength figures—80 or higher.
Although high relative strength is good, is there such a thing as it being too high? In other
words, might a relative strength of 99 indicate that the stock is overextended and vulnerable
to a sharp correction?
You have to look at a chart to make that determination. The key point is not how high the relative
strength is, but rather how far the stock is extended beyond its most recent price base. You buy
stocks that have a high relative strength if they are just beginning to emerge from a sound base-
building period. However, I would generally not buy a stock with a high relative strength that is
already more than 10 percent beyond its prior price base.
The "M" in the CANSLIM formula makes sense since few stocks can buck a general bear
market. However, that rule sounds easier in theory than in practice. After all, how do you tell
the difference between a market top and a normal bull market correction?
Top formations in the market averages occur in only one of two ways. First, the average moves up
to a new high, but does so on low volume. This tells you that the demand for stocks is poor at that
point and that the rally is vulnerable. Second, volume surges for several days, but there is very
little, if any, upside price progress as measured by market closes. In this latter case, there may not
be a pickup in volume when the market initially tops, since the distribution has taken place on the
way up.
Another way to determine the direction of the general market is to focus on how the leading stocks
are performing. If the stocks that have been leading the bull market start breaking down, that is a
major sign the market has topped. Another important factor to watch is the Federal Reserve
discount rate. Usually, after the Fed raises the rate two or three times, the market runs into trouble.
The daily advance/decline line is sometimes a useful indicator to watch for signs of a market top.
[The advance/decline line illustrates the difference between the total number of New York Stock
Exchange stocks advancing each day versus the number declining.] Frequently, the advance/decline
line will lag behind the market averages and fail to penetrate prior peaks after the averages reach
110

==================================================

new highs. This indicates that fewer stocks are participating in the market advance.
When you believe that the general market has entered a bearish phase, would you advise
going short rather than merely liquidating longs?
I don't normally advise people to sell short unless they are professional traders. Selling short is
quite tricky. I myself have only made significant profits on the short side of two of the last nine
bear markets.
A stock should never be sold short because its price looks too high. The idea is not to sell short at
the top, but at the right time. Short selling of individual stocks should only be considered after the
general market shows signs of a top. The best chart pattern to short is one in which a stock breaks
out on the upside of its third or fourth base and then fails. The stock should be breaking down
toward the low end of its previous base pattern on increased volume. After the first serious price
break below the base, there will usually be several pullback attempts. The prior base will now
provide an area of overhead supply, as all investors who bought in that zone will be losing money,
and a number of them will be eager to get out near breakeven. Therefore, pullbacks to failed price
bases also provide good timing for short sales.
Does the element of unlimited risk present any special problem in short selling?
No, because I never take unlimited risk. If a short position goes against me, I will be out after the
first 6 or 7 percent loss. Before you sell any stock short, you should decide the price at which you
will cover that short position if a loss occurs.
Besides the CANSLIM formula, which is critical to your stock selection process, risk control
obviously plays an important role in your overall strategy. Can you talk a little bit more
about that element of trading?
My philosophy is that all stocks are bad. There are no good stocks unless they go up in price. If
they go down instead, you have to cut your losses fast. The secret for winning in the stock market
does not include being right all the time. In fact, you should be able to win even if you are right
only half the time. The key is to lose the least amount of money possible when you are wrong. I
make it a rule never to lose more than a maximum of 7 percent on any stock I buy. If a stock drops
7 percent below my purchase price, I will automatically sell it at the market—no second-guessing,
no hesitation.
Some people say, "I can't sell that stock because I'd be taking a loss." If the stock is below the price
you paid for it, selling doesn't give you the loss; you already have it. Letting losses run is the most
serious mistake made by most investors. The public doesn't really understand the philosophy of
cutting losses quickly. If you don't have a rule like cutting a loss at 7 percent, then in bear markets
like 1973-74, you can lose 70 or 80 percent on your holdings. I have seen people go bankrupt in
that type of situation. If you aren't willing to cut your losses short, then you probably should not
buy stocks. Would you drive your car without brakes?
In my book, I repeat a story told by Fred C. Kelly, the author of Why You Win or Lose, that
provides the best example I know of how the typical investor procrastinates when it comes to
making a selling decision. A man has rigged up a turkey trap with a trail of corn leading into a big
box with a hinged door. The man holds a long piece of twine, connected to the door, that he can use
to pull the door shut once enough turkeys have wandered into the box. However, once he shuts the
door, he can't open it again without going back to the box, which would scare away any turkeys
lurking on the outside.
One day, he had a dozen turkeys in his box. Then one walked out, leaving eleven. "I should have
pulled the string when there were twelve inside," he thought, "but maybe if I wait, he will walk
back in." While he was waiting for his twelfth turkey to return, two more turkeys walked out. "I
should have been satisfied with the eleven," he thought. "If just one of them walks back, I will pull
the string." While he was waiting, three more turkeys walked out. Eventually, he was left empty-
handed. His problem was that he couldn't give up the idea that some of the original turkeys would
return. This is the attitude of the typical investor who can't bring himself to sell at a loss. He keeps
expecting the stock to recover. The moral is: To reduce your stock market risk, stop counting
turkeys.

==================================================

OK, you use your CANSLIM methodology for selecting stocks, and your 7 percent rule for
getting out if you are wrong. How do you decide when to liquidate a winning stock position?
First, you should hold a stock as long as it is performing properly. Jesse Livermore said, "It is never
your thinking that makes big money, it's the sitting." Second, you have to realize that you will
never sell the exact top. Therefore, it is ridiculous to kick yourself when a stock goes higher after
you sell. The goal is to make substantial profits on your stocks and not be upset if the price
continues to advance after you get out.
Your writings express disdain for a number of factors that many people consider important,
including P/E ratios, dividends, diversification, and overbought/oversold indicators. Could
you explain what you think is wrong with the conventional wisdom regarding these subjects.
Let's start with P/E ratios.
To say that a stock is undervalued because it is selling at a low P/E ratio is nonsense. In our
research, we found there was a very low correlation between the P/E ratio and the best-performing
stocks. Some of these stocks had P/E ratios of 10 when they started their major advance; others had
P/E ratios of 50. During the thirty-three years in our survey period [1953-1985], the average P/E
ratio for the best-performing stocks at their early emerging stage was 20, compared to an average
P/E ratio of 15 for the Dow Jones Average during the same time. At the end of their expansion
phase, these stocks had an average P/E ratio of approximately 45. This means that if, in the past,
you were not willing to buy stocks with above-average P/Es, you automatically eliminated most of
the best-performing securities.
A common mistake a lot of investors make is to buy a stock solely because the P/E ratio looks
cheap. There is usually a very good reason why a P/E ratio is low. Many years ago, when I was first
beginning to study the market, I bought Northrop at four times earnings and watched in disbelief as
the stock eventually declined to two times earnings.
Another common mistake is selling stocks with high P/E ratios. I still remember in 1962 when an
investor barged into my friend's brokerage office, declaring in a loud voice that Xerox was
drastically overpriced because it was selling at fifty times earnings. He went short at $88. Xerox
eventually went to $1,300, adjusting for stock splits.
Your thoughts on dividends?
There is no correlation between dividends and a stock's performance, hi fact, the more a company
pays in dividends, the weaker their posture because they may have to pay high interest rates to
replace funds paid out in dividends. It is naive to hold stocks that are going down because they pay
dividends. If you are getting a 4 percent dividend and the stock goes down 25 percent, your net
yield is a 21 percent loss.
How about overbought/oversold indicators?
I rarely pay any attention to overbought/oversold indicators. I once hired a well-known professional
who specialized in such technical indicators. At the very point during the 1969 market break when I
was trying to convince portfolio managers to liquidate stocks and move to cash, he was telling them
it was too late to sell because his indicators said the market was very oversold. Once his indicators
were oversold, the market break really accelerated.
The final item on my list of your most prominent conventional wisdom targets is
diversification.
Diversification is a hedge for ignorance. I think you are much better off owning a few stocks and
knowing a great deal about them. By being very selective, you increase your chances of picking
superior performers. You can also watch those stocks much more carefully, which is important in
controlling risk.
How many issues would you advise a typical investor to hold at any one time?
For an investor with $5,000, one or two; $10,000, three or four; $25,000, four or five; $50,000, five
or six; and $100,000 or more, six or seven.
Aside from the subjects we have just discussed, is there anything else you consider a major
public misconception?

==================================================

Most investors think that charts are hocus-pocus. Only about 5 to 10 percent of investors
understand charts. Even a lot of professionals are totally ignorant about charts. Just as a doctor
would be foolish not to use X-rays and EKGs, investors would be foolish not to use charts. Charts
provide valuable information about what is going on that cannot be obtained easily any other way.
They allow you to follow a huge number of different stocks in an organized manner.
Earlier, you talked about using volume as a clue that the market averages were topping. Do
you also use volume as an indicator in trading individual stocks?
The volume in a stock is a measure of supply and demand. When a stock is beginning to move into
new high ground, volume should increase by at least 50 percent over the average daily volume in
recent months. High volume at a key point is an extraordinarily valuable tip-off that a stock is ready
to move.
Volume can also be used in a reverse manner. When prices enter a consolidation after an advance,
volume should dry up very substantially. In other words, there should be very little selling coming
into the market. During a consolidation, declining volume is generally constructive.
How do you handle a losing streak?
If you hit a losing streak, and it is not because what you are doing is wrong, that tells you the whole
market may be going bad. If you have five or six straight losses, you want to pull back to see if it is
time to start moving into cash.
The "M" in your CANSLIM formula emphasizes the importance of being out of the
market—at least on the long side—during major bear phases. Since most mutual funds, by
their very structure, remain heavily invested in stocks throughout both bull and bear
markets, does this imply that you believe mutual funds are a poor investment?
This is going to surprise you. I think mutual funds are an absolutely outstanding way to invest. I
believe that every person should own their own home, own real estate, and have an individual stock
account or own mutual funds. Those are the only ways you can make any substantial income above
your salary. Although I think mutual funds are an excellent investment, the problem is that most
people don't know how to handle them. The key to success in mutual funds is to sit and not to
think. When you buy a fund, you want to be in it for 15 years or more. That is how you will make
the really big money. But in order to do that, you need the courage to sit through three, four, or five
bear markets. The typical diversified growth stock fund will go up 75 to 100 percent in a bull
market, but it will decline by only 20 to 30 percent in a bear market.
So you treat a fund very differently from an individual stock account?
Very, very differently. With an individual stock, you absolutely have to have a stop-loss point,
because you never know how far down the stock is going. I remember selling a $100 stock one
time and it eventually went to $1.1 didn't have any idea it was going down that far, but what would
have happened if I had held on to it? One mistake like that and you can't come back.
In contrast, in a mutual fund, you should sit through the bear markets. Since most funds will be
diversified in 100 or more stocks across the American economy, when stocks recover after a bear
market, these funds will recover as well—they almost have to. Unfortunately, in a bear market,
most people get scared and decide to switch, ruining their long-term holding plan. Actually, when a
good, diversified growth fund is down sharply, you should buy more.
Would it be fair to say that the general public tends to treat funds like they should individual
stocks and stocks like they should funds? By that I mean, they tend to hold on to their losers
in individual stocks, but liquidate their mutual funds when they are down sharply.
Yes, that is exactly right. Because of the emotional element, most of what people do in the market
is wrong.
Along that line, what are the biggest mistakes investors generally make?
In my book I have a chapter on eighteen common mistakes.
The following list of common mistakes is excerpted from O'Neil's book How to Make Money in
Stocks, published by McGraw-Hill in 1988.
1. Most investors never get past the starting gate because they do not use good selection criteria.
113



==================================================
                     PAGE 114                     
==================================================

They do not know what to look for to find a successful stock. Therefore, they buy fourth-rate
"nothing-to-write-home-about" stocks that are not acting particularly well in the marketplace and
are not real market leaders.
2. A good way to ensure miserable results is to buy on the way down in price; a declining stock
seems a real bargain because it's cheaper than it was a few months earlier. For example, an
acquaintance of mine bought International Harvester at $19 in March 1981 because it was down in
price sharply and seemed a great bargain. This was his first investment, and he made the classic
tyro's mistake. He bought a stock near its low for the year. As it turned out, the company was in
serious trouble and was headed, at the time, for possible bankruptcy.
3.An even worse habit is to average down in your buying, rather than up. If you buy a stock at $40
and then buy more at $30 and average out your cost at $35, you are following up your losers and
mistakes by putting good money after bad. This amateur strategy can produce serious losses and
weigh you down with a few big losers.
4.The public loves to buy cheap stocks selling at low prices per share. They incorrectly feel it's
wiser to buy more shares of stock in round lots of 100 or 1,000 shares, and this makes them feel
better, perhaps more important. You would be better off buying 30 or 50 shares of higher-priced,
sounder com panies. You must think in terms of the number of dollars you are investing, not the
number of shares you can buy. Buy the best merchandise available, not the poorest. The appeal of a
$2, $5, or $10 stock seems irresistible. But most stocks selling for $10 or lower are there because
the companies have either been inferior in the past or have had something wrong with them recent-
ly. Stocks are like anything else. You can't buy the best quality at the cheapest price!
It usually costs more in commissions and markups to buy low-priced stocks, and your risk is
greater, since cheap stocks can drop 15 to 20 percent faster than most higher-priced stocks.
Professionals and institutions will not normally buy the $5 and $10 stocks, so you have a much
poorer grade following and support for these low-quality securities. As discussed earlier, institu-
tional sponsorship is one of the ingredients needed to help propel a stock higher in price.
5.First-time speculators want to make a killing in the market. They want too much, too fast, without
doing the necessary study and preparation or acquiring the essential methods and skills. They are
looking for an easy way to make a quick buck without spending any time or effort really learning
what they are doing.
6.Mainstream America delights in buying on tips, rumors, stories, and advisory service
recommendations. In other words, they are willing to risk their hard-earned money on what
someone else says, rather than on knowing for sure what they are doing themselves. Most rumors
are false, and even if a tip is correct, the stock ironically will, in many cases, go down in price.
7.Investors buy second-rate stocks because of dividends or low price/earnings ratios. Dividends are
not as important as earnings per share; in fact, the more a company pays in dividends, the weaker
the company may be because it may have to pay high interest rates to replenish internally needed
funds that were paid out in the form of dividends. An investor can lose the amount of a dividend in
one or two days' fluctuation in the price of the stock. A low P/E, of course, is probably low because
the company's past record is inferior.
8.People buy company names they are familiar with, names they know. Just because you used to
work for General Motors doesn't make General Motors necessarily a good stock to buy. Many of
the best investments will be names you won't know very well but could and should know if you
would do a little studying and research.
9.Most investors are not able to find good information and advice. Many, if they had sound advice,
would not recognize or follow it. The average friend, stockbroker, or advisory service could be a
source of losing advice. It is always the exceedingly small minority of your friends, brokers, or
advisory services that are successful enough in the market themselves that merit your consideration.
Outstanding stockbrokers or advisory services are no more frequent than are outstanding doctors,
lawyers, or baseball players. Only one out of nine baseball players that sign professional contracts
ever make it to the big leagues. And, of course, the majority of ballplayers that graduate from
college are not even good enough to sign a professional contract,
10. Over 98 percent of the masses are afraid to buy a stock that is beginning to go into new high
ground, pricewise. It just seems too high to them. Personal feelings and opinions are far less
114



==================================================
                     PAGE 115                     
==================================================

accurate than markets.
11.The majority of unskilled investors stubbornly hold onto their losses when the losses are small
and reasonable. They could get out cheaply, but being emotionally involved and human, they keep
waiting and hoping until their loss gets much bigger and costs them dearly.
12. In a similar vein, investors cash in small, easy-to-take profits and hold their losers. This tactic is
exactly the opposite of correct investment procedure. Investors will sell a stock with a profit before
they will sell one with a loss.
13.Individual investors worry too much about taxes and commissions. Your key objective should
be to first make a net profit. Excessive worrying about taxes usually leads to unsound investments
in the hope of achieving a tax shelter. At other times in the past, investors lost a good profit by
holding on too long, trying to get a long-term capital gain. Some investors, even erroneously,
convince themselves they can't sell because of taxes—strong ego, weak judgment.
Commission costs of buying or selling stocks, especially through a discount broker, are a relatively
minor factor, compared to more important aspects such as making the right decisions in the first
place and taking action when needed. One of the great advantages of owning stock over real estate
is the substantially lower commission and instant marketability and liquidity. This enables you to
protect yourself quickly at a low cost or to take advantage of highly profitable new trends as they
continually evolve.
14.The multitude speculates in options too much because they think it is a way to get rich quick.
When they buy options, they incorrectly concentrate entirely in shorter-term, lower-priced options
that involve greater volatility and risk rather than in longer-term options. The limited time period
works against short-term option holders. Many options speculators also write what are referred to
as "naked options," which are nothing but taking a great risk for a potentially small reward and,
therefore, a relatively unsound investment procedure.
15.Novice investors like to put price limits on their buy-and-sell orders. They rarely place market
orders. This procedure is poor because the investor is quibbling for eighths and quarters of a point,
rather than emphasizing the more important and larger overall movement. Limit orders eventually
result in your completely missing the market and not getting out of stocks that should be sold to
avoid substantial losses.
16.Some investors have trouble making decisions to buy or sell. In other words, they vacillate and
can't make up their minds. They are unsure because they really don't know what they are doing.
They do not have a plan, a set of principles, or rules to guide them and, therefore, are uncertain of
what they should be doing.
17.Most investors cannot look at stocks objectively. They are always hoping and having favorites,
and they rely on their hopes and personal opinions rather than paying attention to the opinion of the
marketplace, which is more frequently right.
18.Investors are usually influenced by things that are not really crucial, such as stock splits,
increased dividends, news announcements, and brokerage firm or advisory recommendations.
As someone who has spent a lifetime researching stocks and the American economy, do you
have any opinions about the quality of research provided by Wall Street firms?
An article in Financial World found that top-rated analysts generally un-derperformed the S&P
average. One major problem is that 80 percent of brokerage firm research is written on the wrong
companies. Each industry analyst has to turn out his or her quota of reports, even though only a few
industry groups are leaders in each cycle. There is insufficient screening to determine which reports
should actually be written. Another major problem with Wall Street research is that it seldom
provides sell recommendations.
I would assume, given the consistency of your success as a stock investor for over twenty-five
years, that you don't think very much of the random walk theory.
The stock market is neither efficient nor random. It is not efficient because there are too many
poorly conceived opinions; it is not random because strong investor emotions can create trends.
In the most general sense, trading success requires three basic components: an effective trade
selection process, risk control, and discipline to adhere to the first two items. William O'Neil
provides a perfect illustration of the successful trader. He has devised a specific strategy for

selecting stocks (CANSLIM), he has a rigorous risk control rale, and he has the discipline not to
deviate from his selection and risk control strategies. In addition to the specific stock selection
methodology detailed in this chapter, traders and investors should find the advice regarding
common mistakes, listed near the end of the interview, particularly useful.

David Ryan-Stock Investment as a Treasure Hunt
David Ryan does not believe in buying low-priced stocks. But that was not always the case. He
remembers flipping through the Wall Street Journal when he was thirteen years old and finding a
$1 stock. He ran with the paper in hand to his father and asked, "If I go up to my room and get a
dollar, can I buy this stock?" His father told him that it didn't quite work that way. "You have to do
some research about a company before you invest in the stock," he explained.
A few days later, leafing through the Wall Street Journal again, Ryan found an article on Ward
Foods, which made Bit-O-Honey and Chunky candy bars. It seemed like a perfect investment,
since he ate a lot of candy. His father set up an account for him, and he bought ten shares of the
stock. He recalls getting all his friends to buy the candy bars so the company would make more
money and his stock would go up. That was the official start of Ryan's career as a stock investor.
Ryan's interest in the stock market increased as he grew older. By the time he was sixteen years
old, he was subscribing to a weekly chart service and attending investment seminars by William
O'Neil and other market analysts. In college, he read every book on the stock market he could find.
William O'Neil was Ryan's idol. After graduating college in 1982, he decided to try to get a job at
O'Neil's company. He told the receptionist of his interest in O'Neil's work and his willingness to
accept any job, no matter how menial, just to get his foot in the door. He was even willing to work
for free. Ryan was hired, and within four years, his investment success led to his appointment as the
youngest vice-president of the company, with responsibilities as a portfolio manager and as
O'Neil's direct assistant in stock selection for institutional clients.
Ryan achieved a degree of fame in his own regard when he won the 1985 stock division of the U.S.
Investing Championship, a contest ran by former Stanford University Professor Norm Zadeh. His
return that year was a phenomenal 161 percent. As if to demonstrate that his performance was no
one-year fluke, Ryan reentered the contest in 1986, virtually duplicating his previous year's
performance with a 160 percent return second-place finish. In 1987, he won the contest once again
with another triple-digit return year. For the three years as a whole, his compounded return was a
remarkable 1,379 percent.
Although most of the traders I interviewed have a love for trading, none have the unbridled
enthusiasm demonstrated by Ryan. To Ryan, the whole process of stock selection is like a terrific
game—a treasure hunt as he describes it—and he still can't believe he is getting paid to do it.
The offices of the traders I interviewed ranged from the unadorned to the elaborate, but Ryan
clearly had the low end of the spectrum staked out. Instead of an office, plain or otherwise, I was
surprised to find Ryan's workplace to be a cubicle within a noisy, floor-sized room. Ryan didn't
seem to care about the lack of amenities. I suspect that as long as he was supplied with his charts
and computer runs, he would probably be content to work in a hall closet.
Did your original job at William O'Neil & Co. involve any market analysis?
No, but once I was in, I just started studying and studying.
On your own time, I take it
Yes. I would take stuff home every night and on weekends.
What kind of things were you studying?
I would go over our charts. I studied the company's past recommendations. I studied historical
models of great winning stocks to ingrain in my mind what a stock looked like before it made a
major move. I tried to get to the point where I was looking at the exact same things O'Neil did. He
was my role model.
Were you trading at this time?
Yes, I opened a $20,000 account shortly after I started working for the company [1982].
How did you do?
Initially, I ran the account up to about $52,000 by June 1983. Then I gave it all back, including
some of my starting capital. By mid-1984, my account was down to $16,000.
Do you know what you did wrong?
Yes. I sat down and studied every mistake that I had made from June 1983 through the middle of
117



==================================================
                     PAGE 118                     
==================================================

1984. Probably my biggest mistake was that even though we were in a moderate bear market—the
Dow came down from 1,296 to 1,078—I continued to play as aggressively as I had during the bull
market from August 1982 through June 1983.1 also made the mistake of buying stocks that were
overextended. By that I mean I was buying stocks that had already moved 15 to 20 percent above
their price bases. You should only buy stocks that are within a few percent of their base; otherwise,
the risk is too great.
I turned it around by learning from all the mistakes that I had made. In late 1984,1 sold a piece of
real estate I owned and put all the money in a stock account.
Were you confident, despite your poor performance during mid-1983 to mid-1984, because
you felt that you had figured out what you were doing wrong?
Yes, because I had studied very hard and was determined to be disciplined, I thought I was going to
do very well. So in 19851 entered the U.S. Investing Championship. I won the stock division that
year with a 161 percent return, I reentered the contest in subsequent years and substantially
exceeded 100 percent returns in 1986 and 1987 as well. I was doing the exact same thing over and
over again. I was buying stocks when they had all the characteristics I liked.
How are you doing this year [May 1988]?
So far this year, I am down. We are in a different type of market: Stocks aren't moving as quickly
as they have in the last three years. I am playing with a much smaller amount this year, because I
think the potential for making a lot of money is much more limited.
You mentioned earlier that for a while you read virtually every book on the markets you
could find. What reading list would you give to someone starting out who is serious about
becoming a successful stock trader?
Essential reading on top of the list is O'Neil's book, How to Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill,
New York, NY 1988). Another book that is must reading is How I Made Two Million Dollars in the
Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas (Lyle Stuart, Inc., Secaucus, NJ, 1986). A lot of people laugh at
that title, but it is fun reading and you learn a ton. Another book I would recommend is
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre [reputedly about Jesse Livermore].
Livermore himself wrote a very good thin volume, How to Trade in Stocks (Institute for Economic
& Financial Research, Albuquerque, NM, 1986).
Any others?
A good one on what to look for in individual stocks is Super Performance Stocks by Richard Love
(Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1977). The book has a great study on some of the greatest
winners of all time. Another good one on picking stocks is Profile of a Growth Stock by Kermit
Zieg and Susannah H. Zieg (Investor's Intelligence, Larchmont, NY, 1972). I would also
recommend Marty Zweig's book, Winning on Wall Street (Warner Books, Inc., New York, NY,
1986) and Stan Weinstein's Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets (Dow, Jones-Irwin, New
York, NY, 1988), which has some good sections on short selling. Finally, on Elliott Wave analysis,
which I think has some validity, there is Elliott Wave Principle by Frost and Prechter (New Classic
Library, Inc., Gainesville, GA, 1978) and a book called Super Timing by an English fellow named
Beckman (Milestone Publishers, London).
All those books are good, but you learn the most from the market itself. Every time I buy a stock, I
write down the reasons why I bought it [he pulls out a binder containing annotated charts]. Doing
this helps cement in my mind the characteristics of a winning stock. Maybe even more important, it
helps me learn from my mistakes.
What kind of things did you learn by keeping your trader's diary?
Not buying overextended stocks, using О'Neil's criteria for stock selection, and being as disciplined
as possible. The more disciplined you can get, the better you are going to do in the market. The
more you listen to tips and rumors, the more money you're likely to lose.
Has keeping this diary been an important part of your success?
Absolutely.
Can you describe your procedure for selecting stocks?
118



==================================================
                     PAGE 119                     
==================================================

I start out by going through the stock charts and writing down the stocks with strong technical
action. In other words, I write down all the stocks
I want to take a closer look at.
Your company follows 7,000 stocks; you can't possibly look at 7,000 charts on a regular basis.
I don't look through 7,000, but in a week I probably go through about 4,000 charts. So, I see a
majority of the data base. Keep in mind there are probably about 1,500 to 2,000 stocks that trade
under $ 10, and I don't like to look at those anyway.
Is that a good rule: Avoid stocks under $10?
Yes, because they are usually down there for a reason.
Doesn't that knock out a lot of the OTC stocks?
Yes, a lot of the smaller OTC stocks.
But aren't those sometimes the best buys—the stocks that no one is paying any attention to?
Sometimes. But many of those stocks stay down there for years and years. I would rather wait until
they prove themselves by moving up to the $15 to $20 range.
After you have reviewed the charts and written down the stocks that interest you, what do
you look at next to screen your selection?
I look at the five-year earnings growth record and the last two quarters of earnings relative to the
previous year's levels. The quarterly comparisons show you if there is any deceleration in the
earnings growth rate. For example, a 30 percent growth rate over the last five years may look very
impressive, but if in the last two quarters earnings were only up 10 percent and 15 percent, it warns
you that the strong growth period may be over. Of course, those two factors—the five-year
earnings growth record and the earnings during the past two quarters—are combined in our
earnings per share (EPS) rank. [See the O'Neil chapter for a detailed explanation of the EPS.]
What are you looking for in an EPS figure?
As high as possible—at least above 80, and preferably above 90. Actually, a lot of stocks I buy
have an EPS rank of 99.
In my experience, markets usually anticipate. One thing that surprises me about the EPS is
that I would think that the price of the stock would run up well before the earnings growth
starts to be extremely positive.
That is what a lot of people think. They say, "It's too late to buy the stock; the earnings are already
on the table." However, in analyzing hundreds of the biggest winners, we found that, in many
cases, the earnings had been on the table for a while.
What would cause a stock to just sit despite very good earnings?
The broad stock market may be weak and holding back the stock, but once the weight of the market
comes off, these stocks just go right through the roof.
How about if the stock market is OK? What would keep the stock from taking off in that type
of situation?
Perceptions—people might not believe that the earnings are going to continue as strongly as they
had in the past.
What else are you using besides the EPS and the earnings breakdown to screen your stock
selections?
The relative strength is very important. [The relative strength ranks a stock's price change relative
to all other stocks surveyed. See the O'Neil chapter for a detailed definition.]
What are you looking for in relative strength?
At least above 80, and preferably above 90.
Intuitively, I would almost think that—
"It has already gone too far. It can't get any stronger."
Well, not necessarily that it can't get any stronger, but it seems to me that, by definition,
119



==================================================
                     PAGE 120                     
==================================================

every stock has to have a high relative strength when it tops. How do you avoid sometimes
buying the highs, if you are restricting yourself to high relative strength stocks?
I am usually able to avoid that because in my first step of screening the charts, I generally rale out
stocks that are overextended from their base. Very often the stocks with the highest relative
strength continue to outperform the market for months and months. For example, Microsoft had a
relative strength of 97 when it was at $50 a share. It eventually moved to $161.
Are you implying that the higher the relative strength the better?
Yes, I would rather go with a relative strength of 99 than 95. However, once the relative strength
starts falling off, I usually get out of the stock.
So you are not only paying attention to the relative strength value itself, but also the trend of
the relative strength.
Right. If the relative strength starts breaking an uptrend, then I would be very cautious, even if it is
still well above 80.
Am I going in the right order, EPS to relative strength, in terms of how you filter down your
initial stock list?
I would probably place relative strength first, then EPS. Many times the relative strength takes off
before that big earnings report comes out.
Do you also use the relative strength of the industry as a filter in your stock selection?
Yes. Investor's Daily ranks industry groups between 0 and 200.1 usually want the industry group to
be in the top 50.
To continue the screening process, after checking the stock's relative strength, the EPS, and
the industry relative strength, what is your next step?
I check the number of shares outstanding. I am looking for stocks with less than thirty million
shares and preferably only five to ten million shares. Stocks with more than thirty million shares
are more mature; they have already split a few times. It is a case of supply and demand: Because
you have more supply, it takes a lot more money to move those stocks.
What else do you look at?
You want some institutional ownership, because they really power a stock higher, but you don't
want too much sponsorship. I would say 1 percent to 20 percent mutual fund sponsorship is the
ideal range.
Are there any other important elements that go into the stock selection process?
Yes. There should be something new that attracts people to that stock. For example, Reebok had
shoes that were hot. Compaq had a fantastic portable computer. Microsoft was a leader in the
software field.
Doesn't that rule out most companies that have been around for a while?
Yes. You don't want to be playing General Electric because there is usually nothing really hot or
brand new going on. Occasionally, there are exceptions. For example, General Motors has gone
virtually sideways for the last five years, and it looks like they are trying to turn their situation
around.
With General Motors, might the "new" be the recent shift to high styling?
Yes, but in most cases, you are going to find the new in emerging entrepreneurial growth
companies.
I would imagine if you go through 7,000 stocks, there must be quite a large number that meet
your criteria.
On average, there are probably only about seventy stocks that meet the criteria, because it is tough
to meet all the conditions. Then I cut those seventy down to about seven.
How do you cut down from seventy to seven?
I pick those stocks that have all the characteristics plus a great-looking base pattern. I also look at
how the stock has done in the past. For example, has the stock doubled before? A lot of the stocks I
120



==================================================
                     PAGE 121                     
==================================================

buy have already doubled and tripled before I buy them.
You actually prefer to buy a stock that has already doubled as opposed to a stock that is in a
long base?
Yes, because that shows me there is something very unusual going on, and if the situation is that
good, a doubling may just be the beginning. It is probably going to double again. To sum it up, I am
looking for the strongest stocks in the market, in terms of both earnings and the technical picture.
Since you use an extremely rigorous selection process, do you have a high percentage of
winners in your stock picks?
No, only about 50/50, because I cut the losers very quickly. The maximum loss I allow is 7 percent,
and usually I am out of a losing stock a lot quicker. I make my money on the few stocks a year that
double and triple in price. The profits in those trades easily make up for all the small losers.
How long do you typically hold a stock?
I usually hold my big winners for about six to twelve months, stocks that aren't that strong about
three months, and my losers less than two weeks.
Do you pick an objective on the stocks you buy?
No. I usually wait until the stock runs up, builds another base, and then breaks down. That is when
I liquidate.
Do you think people should only use market orders?
In a dull market that is just trading back and forth, you could put in a limit order. But if you really
think the stock is going to make a big move—and that should be the only reason you are buying the
stock to begin with—then there is no reason to haggle over an eighth of a point. Just buy the stock.
The same thing applies to the downside; if you think the stock is going to drop, just sell it.
I learned the lesson about market orders in 1982 when I was trying to buy Textone, which was
trading at $15, for $14%. The next day it jumped llh points, and I couldn't bring myself to buy the
stock at $16k when I could have bought it at $15 a day earlier. That stock eventually went to $45.
One element of your trading style is buying a stock when it makes a new high. Wouldn't the
fundamental screening conditions you use have been in place well before that point?
In some cases, they might have been. But I am trying to buy a stock when you have the most
chance of making money. When a stock is coming off the low end of a base back to the high end,
there will be a lot of people who bought it near the highs and sat with a loss for months. Some of
those people are going to be happy to get out at even, and that creates a lot of overhead resistance.
So, a stock which is at new highs has much more of an open running field?
Right, because no one ahead of you is at a loss and wants to get out at the first opportunity.
Everybody has a profit; everybody is happy.
But the downside of that is if you wait for a breakout to new highs, a lot of times the market
will pull back into the trading range. How do you avoid getting whipsawed in those
situations?
You can tell a lot by the volume. If the volume doubles one day and the stock moves to a new high,
it is telling you a lot of people are interested in the stock and buying it.
So volume becomes very important as a filtering process to avoid getting whipsawed.
Yes. If the stock moves to new high ground, but the volume is only up 10 percent, I would be wary.
Do you buy it the first day the stock breaks out to new highs, or do you wait for it to
consolidate for a few days?
I want to buy it as soon as it goes to new highs.
If you buy a stock at new highs and it then pulls back into the range, at what point do you
decide it was a false breakout? For example, assume a stock that has been trading between
$16 and $20 goes to $21 and you buy it. What do you do if two days later the stock is back to
$19?
If it reenters its base, I have a rule to cut at least 50 percent of the position.
121



==================================================
                     PAGE 122                     
==================================================

If it reenters its base at all? Do you mean even if it is just below the top end of the base, or do
you require some minimum penetration?
No, if it just reenters the base. In some cases, it will break out and come back to the top of the base,
but not reenter. That's fine, and I will stay with the stock. But if the top of the base was $20 and it
breaks back to $193A, I want to sell at least half of the position because the stock didn't keep on
moving. Frequently, when a stock drops back into its base, it goes all the way back down to the
lower end of the base. In the example, if it goes from $21 down to $19X it will often go all the way
back down to $16. Therefore, you want to cut your losses quickly.
From a technical perspective, is the price going back into the base a bearish indicator?
Yes. Stocks should be at a profit the first day you buy them. In fact, having a profit on the first day
is one of the best indicators that you are going to make money on the trade.
Do you use the table in Investor's Daily that lists the stocks with the greatest percentage
increase in volume relative to the past fifty-day average volume levels?
Yes, I use it to help spot stocks that are just about ready to take off.
Are you using it to verify stocks you have already picked out?
Yes. After I have done my weekly screen to select the stocks I am interested in buying, I sometimes
wait for the stock to hit that column as a timing signal.
Can you elaborate on using volume as a trading tool?
When a stock that has been moving up starts consolidating, you want to see volume dry up. You
should see a downtrend in volume. Then when volume starts picking up again, it usually means the
stock is ready to blast off.
So, in the consolidation phase, decreasing volume is good. If you continue to see very high
volume, do you start thinking potential top?
Yes, because that shows that a lot of people are getting out of the stock. You want an increase in
volume when the stock breaks out, but you want a decrease in volume as the stock consolidates.
Any other volume signals you look for?
When the market, or a stock, is bottoming, you want to see increased volume combined with an
absence of further price progress on the downside. For example, if the Dow declines from 2,200 to
2,100, trades down to 2,085 the next day, and then closes higher on increased volume, it
demonstrates support. It suggests that there are a lot of buyers coming in.
The screens you have described in selecting stocks are essentially O'Neil's CANSLIM
methodology. [See the O'Neil chapter for definition.] Did you add any of your own elements
to his approach?
Yes, I learned that most of our greatest winning recommendations started off with prices under
thirty times earnings. О'Nell says the P/E [price/earnings] ratio is not important. I think it is, in that
your success ratio is a lot higher on lower P/E ratio stocks.
But I guess not too low P/E ratios?
When I'm talking about lower P/E ratio stocks, I mean stocks that have a P/E ratio that is between
even and up to two times the S&P 500 P/E ratio. So if the S&P 500 is at fifteen times earnings, you
should try to buy stocks with P/E ratios between 15 and 30. Once you start going much beyond
double the S&P 500 P/E ratio level, your timing has to be more exact. You are bound to make a
few more mistakes on higher P/E ratio stocks.
Do you therefore avoid high P/E ratio stocks?
Yes, in many cases I do. The most profitable situation is when you find a stock with a strong
earnings trend that is trading at a P/E ratio in line with the broad market ratio.
If you avoid high P/E ratio stocks, wouldn't that have prevented you from catching the whole
biomedical group move?
That was a little different because of the fact that the whole group was trading at high P/E ratios.
Does that imply that there should be an exception made for a new industry?

==================================================

Yes, you don't want to be absolutely rigid with these rules.
Has the basic market behavior stayed the same in the 1980s versus the 1970s and the 1960s?
Yes, the same types of stocks work time after time. It hasn't changed at all. We can take one of the
greatest winning stocks from 1960 and line it up with one of the best stocks in 1980 and they are
going to have exactly the same characteristics.
Do you have any thoughts on the subject of short selling?
I need more time to study it and more experience. However, to pick a short, I think you need to flip
all these characteristics we were talking about. Instead of a good growth record, you should look
for a poor five-year growth record and quarterly earnings that are decelerating. The stock should be
losing relative strength, breaking uptrends, and starting to hit new lows.
Do you think that short selling may be a critical element for superior performance if we go
into a long bear market?
Yes, I think it would help. But, Bill O'Neil will tell you that shorting is about three times as hard as
buying stocks. Bill says he has made substantial money in only two of the past nine bear markets.
He thinks the best thing you can do in a bear market is just sit it out.
How do you recognize a bear market before it's too late?
By how well my individual stocks are doing. If, during the bull phase, the leaders start losing, it
indicates that a bear market is developing. If I have five or six stocks in a row that get stopped out,
a caution flag goes up.
What else do you look for to signal a bear market?
Divergence between the Dow and the daily advance/decline line [a graph of the cumulative net
difference between the number of New York Stock Exchange stocks advancing each day versus the
number declining]. The advance/decline tends to top out a few months before the Dow does.
Did that happen in 1987?
The advance/decline topped out during the first quarter of 1987, well before the stock market peak
in August.
Were you looking for a top because of that?
Not at that point, because a lot of the individual stocks were still doing very well. The big clue that
the market was really topping was after the Dow came off its high at 2,746, there was a very feeble,
low-volume rally, and then the market got hit for another 90-point loss. At that juncture, I decided
it was time to move out of the market.
Because the rally was on low volume?
Yes, and the fact that there were very few stocks that participated in the rally; the advance/decline
line did not move as high as it did on the previous rally. Also, in late August, the discount rate was
raised for the first time in three years. I think that really stabbed the market.
You haven't been in the business that long. Do you have the confidence that you will be able
to trade successfully almost every year for a long time?
Yes, because I have established a very defined set of principles that will provide the foundation for
successful trading for years to come. Also, I plan to never stop learning.
Do you feel you are getting better as a trader?
Yes. If you try to learn from every single trade that you make, you are only going to get better and
better as time goes on.
Why are you so much more successful than the typical stock investor?
Because I am doing something that I love to do and find fascinating. After eight or nine hours at
work, I go home and spend more time on the markets. I have the charts delivered to me on
Saturdays, and I go through them for three or four hours on Sunday. I think if you love what you
are doing, you are going to be a lot more successful.
A lot of people who invest use their spare time to study the market and still have only
mediocre, or even losing, results.

That is probably because they have not found a disciplined system for picking stocks. They read an
article and say, "That sounds like a good stock, I'll buy it." Or they buy a stock because their broker
recommends it.
What advice would you give the novice trader?
The single most important advice I can give anybody is: Learn from your mistakes. That is the only
way to become a successful trader.
Any final comments?
The greatest thing about the market is that it is always fun to be looking for that next big winner—
trying to find the stock with all the characteristics that are going to make it have a big move. The
feeling isn't any different now than when I was only trading 500 shares. There is still the same
satisfaction of knowing you found a stock before it made its big move.
You make it sound like a game.
It is. To me it is like a giant treasure hunt. Somewhere in here [he pats the weekly chart book] there
is going to be a big winner, and I am trying to find it.
The conventional wisdom about how to make money in stocks is summarized by the semi-facetious
advice: Buy low and sell high. David Ryan would disagree. His philosophy can be summarized as:
Buy high and sell higher. In fact, Ryan usually will not consider buying any stock selling for less
than $10.
Ryan's success is basically due to using aprecise methodology and applying great discipline to
follow it. As Ryan has clearly demonstrated, a trading methodology doesn't have to be original to
be extremely successful. Ryan readily acknowledges that most of his approach has been learned
directly from the writings and teachings of William O'Neil. With the help of hard work and in-
depth study, he has been able to apply O'Neil's trading philosophy with great effectiveness.
When traders deviate from their own rules, they invariably tend to lose. Ryan is no exception.
During mid-1983 to mid-1984, he witnessed a period of extremely poor performance. He let his
previous trading success go to his head by repeatedly breaking one of his own cardinal rules: Never
buy an overextended stock [a stock that is trading far above its most recent price base]. The 1983-
1984 experience made a lasting impression on Ryan, and he has not repeated that mistake.
Maintaining a trader's diary is an essential element of Ryan's approach. Every time he buys a stock,
Ryan annotates the chart with his reasons for buying the stock. Whenever he liquidates or adds to
an existing position, a new chart is included with updated comments. This approach has helped
Ryan reinforce in his mind the key characteristics of winning stocks. Perhaps, more important,
reviewing his past entries has helped him avoid repeating similar trading mistakes.
Ryan's basic approach, like William O'Neil's approach, is to buy value and strength. He also
believes in focusing on the very best stocks as opposed to diversifying his portfolio. One important
observation Ryan made, which many other traders may find helpful, is that his best trades are
usually winners right from the start. Thus, he has little reservation about getting out of a losing
trade quickly. The maximum he will risk on any trade is a 7 percent price decline. A rigid stop-loss
rule is an essential ingredient to the trading approach of many successful traders.

Marty Schwartz-Champion Trader
I interviewed Marty Schwartz at his office after trading hours. I found him to be very opinionated
and intense about the subject of trading. This intensity occasionally spills over into anger when a
raw nerve is hit (such as program trading). In fact, Schwartz readily admits that he finds anger a
useful trait in trading. None of this "going with the market flow" philosophy for Schwartz. In his
view, the marketplace is an arena and other traders are the adversaries.
I was also struck by Schwartz's dedication to his daily work routine. He was doing his market
analysis when I arrived and continued to run through his calculations during our interview. When I
left that evening, his analysis was still unfinished. Although he appeared very tired, I had no doubt
that he would finish his work that evening. Schwartz has followed his daily work routine
religiously during the past nine years.
Schwartz spent a decade losing money on his trading before he found his stride as a remarkably
successful professional trader. During his earlier years, he was a well-paid securities analyst, who,
as he describes it, was always broke because of market losses. Eventually, he changed his trading
methodology, in the process of transforming himself from a repeated loser to an amazingly
consistent winner. Not only has Schwartz scored enormous percentage gains in every year since he
turned full-time trader in 1979, but he has done so without ever losing more than 3 percent of his
equity on a month-end to month-end basis.
Schwartz trades independently from an office at home. He is proud of the fact that he has no
employees. Solitary traders of this type, no matter how successful, are usually unknown to the
public. Schwartz, however, has attained a degree of fame through repeated entries in the U.S.
Trading Championships, run by Norm Zadeh, a Stanford University professor. His performance in
these contests has been nothing short of astounding. In nine of the ten four-month trading
championships he entered (typically with a starting stake of $400,000), he made more money than
all the other contestants combined. His average return in these nine contests was 210 percent—
nonannualized! (In the one remaining four-month contest he witnessed a near breakeven result.) In
his single entry in a one-year contest, he scored a 781 percent return. Schwartz's entry into these
contests is his way of telling the world that he is the best trader around. In terms of risk/reward
ratios, he may well be.
Please start by telling me about your early days.
How far back do you want me to go?
From whenever you think is appropriate.
Well it is very relevant to go back to my childhood, quite frankly. Should I lay down on the couch?
I grew up in New Haven in a family of modest means. I was very hard working. When I was seven
or eight I would go out with a snow shovel and come back with $10 after a snowstorm.
Even now, I still put in about twelve hours a day. I feel uncomfortable not doing the work; that's
why I am doing it now as you are sitting here. I calculate a lot of mathematical ratios and
oscillators, and I post my own charts. My attitude is that I always want to be better prepared than
someone I'm competing against. The way I prepare myself is by doing my work each night.
As I grew up, I realized that education was my ticket, probably because it was strongly emphasized
in my family. I studied hard and was an honor student in high school.
I was accepted to Amherst College, which was one of the great experiences of my life. When I
went to freshman orientation they said, "Look to your left and right and realize that half of you are
going to be in the top half of the class and half of you are going to be in the bottom half." Most of
those who matriculated there, including myself, were in the top 5 percent of their high school class.
Perceiving that I wasn't going to be at the top of everything was a difficult first realization.
It was the first time in my life I had to struggle. I even had to get a tutor for calculus because I just
wasn't getting the concept. But when I finally got it, when the light bulb clicked on, it was like
looking at a magnificent painting. I really experienced the joy of learning and working hard there.
Before, studying was only a means to an end; now, I found that learning itself was a real joy.
Amherst had a profound influence on me.
After graduating in 1967,1 was accepted to the Columbia Business School. At the time, the
125

==================================================

government had just ended graduate school military deferments. Since I was unhappy at Columbia
and combat in Vietnam didn't appeal to me, I joined a U.S. Marine Corps reserve unit that was
recruiting officers.
You have to be somewhat crazy to be in the Marines; it is a very unusual organization. They push
you to the edge and then rebuild you in their own mold. However, I have developed a great respect
for that bureaucracy, because throughout the Marine Corps history, they've been consistent in their
training procedure. As a second lieutenant you have forty-six lives under your control, so you must
be well skilled. They put you under a lot of pressure. If you couldn't cut the mustard, you didn't get
the bars. We had an attrition rate that I believe approached 50 percent.
I was the only reservist in Officers Candidate School in Quantico at that time. There were 199
regulars who went to Vietnam, but I came home; that was the deal I made when I was recruited. I
was also the only Jewish person there, and they weren't too favorably disposed toward Jews. One
time, the platoon sergeant drew the Star of David on my forehead with a magic marker. I wanted to
knock the crap out of him, but I figured he didn't really know the historic significance of what it
meant. I knew he was just trying to find any kind of pressure point that would make me break. The
hardest thing I had to do was scrub the magic marker off my forehead. That's a bitch [he laughs].
Anyway, I persevered and made it through successfully. I consider that a really fine achievement.
The feeling improves as time passes, and you forget the real pain of the experience.
The rigorous Marine training gave me the confidence to believe that I could perform at levels
beyond my previous expectations. Just as Amherst had strengthened my mind, the Marines
strengthened my body. The two experiences convinced me that I could do almost anything if I
worked hard enough and provided the groundwork for my successful trading. That's not to say it
worked right away, because it didn't.
After getting out of the Marines, I returned to Columbia and held some boring part-time jobs while
I completed my M.B.A. My first full-time job was as a securities analyst at Kuhn Loeb. I
specialized in the health and retail field, and I stayed there for two years. I found that, on Wall
Street, the best way to receive a pay increase was to change jobs. The company you work for never
wants to pay you as much as a company trying to recruit you.
I left for XYZ in 1972.1 want to leave out the firm's name and other particulars for reasons that will
soon become obvious. This proved to be one of the most difficult periods in my life and career.
XYZ had thirty analysts, divided into three subgroups often. Because the research director didn't
want to work, he had one of the senior analysts of each group review the work of the analysts. The
policy was that our research reports would be circulated and critiqued by the other analysts within
the subgroups prior to being sent out.
I had written a bearish report on hospital management stocks, saying that the industry would
eventually go to a utility rate of return. As part of the normal routine, the draft was circulated
among the other analysts, one of whom got drunk one night on a flight home from California and
told a client about my report. He even sent him a copy of the report in progress. What right did he
have to send out my work? The stocks began plummeting prior to the report's release, because the
client started spreading rumors that a negative report was about to be issued.
It was a bitter experience. I had to testify for six hours before the New York Stock Exchange. My
company's counsel told me, "We will represent you, but should our interests diverge at any point,
we will inform you."
At the time, did you know what had happened?
No, I didn't, but I assumed that everything would be all right if I told the truth, which I did. I was
totally exonerated; the exchange realized I had been set up. The drug analyst eventually confessed
because an exchange official found out what happened by piecing it all together. It was a rotten,
bitter experience for me, and I was very sour. I shut the door of my office and stopped working. I
lost the spark, the drive, the desire to succeed.
What were you doing at that time?
I was still doing reports, but I didn't have my heart in it. Besides that whole negative experience, it
was early 1973, and I felt the market was topping out. I had become very interested in technical
analysis. At the time, the advance/decline line had formed a major top many months earlier. I felt
126

                     PAGE 127                     
==================================================

that the market and the stocks I was covering were going to go down. Still, people wanted to know
how many widgets a company was selling and at what price. I lost the spirit to write bullish reports,
because if stock prices are going down, who cares how many widgets are being sold. I was
covering growth stocks, which in those days sold at forty or fifty times earnings. It was all so
ridiculous!
Were you discouraged from writing bearish reports? Also, what ever happened to the bearish
report that was leaked?
Nobody wrote bearish reports on Wall Street at that time. I was allowed to complete the bearish
report on the hospital management industry, but I don't believe they ever intended to publish it. Of
course, after it was leaked, they were forced to rush it to the printer to save their scalps.
What eventually happened?
I lost my job in the bear market and was out of work for four months. That was a very interesting
period, because I believe you learn the most through adversity. I had about $20,000, which in those
days was a lot of money, and I was going to trade. I found a real lunatic who had developed
computer programs for trading commodities. At the time, he had to rent time on a monster machine
to run programs that today you could do on any PC. He was using different moving averages, that
sort of thing. I put some of my money in with him, and I lost most of it—along with my dreams of
glory.
Having dissipated my capital, I decided I had to go back to work. I was in for a shock. Although I
had been totally honest and forthright, I was tainted. "Oh, aren't you the guy who wrote that
report?" It didn't matter that I had been totally ethical and exonerated. People don't want to get
involved with any controversy, even if it wasn't of your own making.
A friend of mine helped me get a job at Edwards & Hanly, which, although it was a retail-oriented
firm, had a group of analysts who became real stars. It was there that I met Bob Zoellner, the
managing partner of the firm. He was a great, great trader. He almost single-handedly kept the firm
afloat in 1974 by shorting stocks and making money in the firm's capital account, while they were
losing money on the operating side. He started his own hedge fund in 1976 and went on to become
an extraordinary success.
I always had a good nose as a securities analyst, and it has stood me in good stead. When I noticed
that the head of research, who never went out to lunch, began going out to lunch regularly, I started
interviewing for another job. So, when the firm went bankrupt in fall 1975, I had another job lined
up at Loeb Rhoades.
In 1976,1 met my wife-to-be and she had a profound effect on me. She made me realize that my
life was not a dress rehearsal; it was the real thing and I had been screwing it up. Although I had
steadily earned good salaries, I was still almost broke because I consistently lost money in the
market.
We got married in March 1978. By that time, I was working at E. F. Hutton. Being married made
going on business trips harder and harder. When you are twenty-five, seeing friends from college in
different cities around the country is very exciting, but when you get in your thirties, it gets real
stale. My wife literally had to push me out the door when I had to go on these trips.
I resented what I called the "tap dances," which made you feel like a piece of meat. You meet with
portfolio managers to give them your views on the stocks you follow, so that they will give
commission business to your firm. On a typical trip, you might have five appointments in Houston,
fly to San Antonio for dinner, and then fly to Dallas later that night to be ready for breakfast the
next morning. I got sick of it.
I wanted to have a family, but I felt that I wasn't able to handle it financially. I had resisted getting
married because I was afraid of being tapped out. But, at that point, I wondered whether it had been
a self-fulfilling prophecy. People seem to know how to handle failure because they can produce it
themselves. It almost becomes a negative cause and effect cycle, whereby they produce it, they
know how to handle it, and they wallow in it.
By mid-1978,1 had been a security analyst for eight years and it had become intolerable. I knew I
had to do something different. I always knew I wanted to work for myself, have no clients, and
answer to no one. That, to me, was the ultimate goal. I had been brooding for years, "Why wasn't I
127

                     PAGE 128                     
==================================================

doing well when I was groomed to be successful?" I decided it was now time to be successful.
When a brokerage firm wants to hire you, they'll give you anything. Once you are there, they are
far less responsive. So, when I was being romanced by Hutton, I asked for a quote machine in my
office. I was the only securities analyst that had a quote machine. During my last year at Hutton, I
started closing the door to my office so that I could watch the market. I talked to my friend Bob
Zoellner several times a day, and he taught me how to analyze market action. For example, when
the market gets good news and goes down, it means the market is very weak; when it gets bad news
and goes up, it means the market is healthy.
During that year, I started taking trial subscriptions to a lot of different newsletters. I consider
myself a synthesizer; I didn't necessarily create a new methodology, but I took a number of
different methodologies and molded them into my own approach.
I found a guy, Terry Laundry, who lived in Nantucket and had an unorthodox approach called the
Magic Т Forecast. He was an МГГ engineering graduate with a math background, and that
appealed to me. His basic theory was that the market spent the same amount of time going up as
going down. Only the amplitude was different.
In my experience, markets come down a lot quicker than they go up. Doesn't that contradict
the theory?
The market movement before it goes down may be a distributive process. I call them M-tops. The
point you use to measure the time element is not the price high, but an oscillator high, which
precedes the price high. That, in fact, is a major cornerstone of his work. The theory had different
properties that I learned, and it has been extremely helpful to me.
For the record, what is the name of Laundry's book?
There is no book. He just extolled his theory through his various newsletters. He also had some
pamphlets. Actually, it was kind of funny. After I mentioned him in a Barren's article, he got a lot
of inquiries for his pamphlets. He is a little eccentric. His response was, "I don't have any copies
available." He should have printed them and made some money.
I developed and synthesized a number of indicators that I used to determine when the market was at
a lower-risk entry point. I focused on determining mathematicalprobabilities. Although
occasionally there are situations where the market goes three standard deviations instead of two,
based on the likelihood that 98 percent of the moves will stop at two standard deviations, I'll take
that bet any day of the week. And, if I am wrong, I am going to use risk control and stop myself out
X dollars away. That is the most critical element.
Anyway, I subscribed to all these letters, developed a methodology, and traded like crazy. By mid-
1979,1 hadrun $5,000 up to $140,000 in just two years.
When did you turn from a loser to a winner?
When I was able to separate my ego needs from making money. When I was able to accept being
wrong. Before, admitting I was wrong was more upsetting than losing the money. I used to try to
will things to happen. I figured it out, therefore it can't be wrong. When I became a winner, I said,
"I figured it out, but if I'm wrong, I'm getting the hell out, because I want to save my money and go
on to the next trade." By living the philosophy that my winners are always in front of me, it is not
so painful to take a loss. If I make a mistake, so what!
Did you make a complete transition from fundamental to technical analysis?
Absolutely. I always laugh at people who say, "I've never met a rich technician." I love that! It is
such an arrogant, nonsensical response. I used fundamentals for nine years and got rich as a
technician.
But you were still doing fundamental analysis as an analyst?
Yes, to earn a salary. But my wife said to me, "Go out on your own. You're thirty-four and you've
always wanted to work for yourself. The worst that can happen is that you '11 go back to doing
what you were doing before."
I always pictured myself as being brave, courageous, and strong, but when it came time to take the
chance, I was scared out of my mind. I had $140,000, of which about $30,000 was tied up in tax
deals and $92,500 was used to pay for a seat on the American Stock Exchange. That left me with

==================================================

about $20,000 when I went on the floor as a market maker. I borrowed $50,000 from my in-laws,
which gave me $70,000 of working capital.
I started off losing in my first two days in the business. I got involved in Mesa Petroleum options
because Zoellner, whom I profoundly respected, thought they were significantly undervalued. I
called him the second day from the floor, "Are you sure you are right?" I must have had a grand
total of ten options. I was down $1,800 and dying. I was petrified because, in my mind, I was down
almost 10 percent, since I didn't consider my in-laws' money part of my own working capital. The
third day, Mesa options started going up and I never looked back.
After the first four months, I was ahead by $100,000. The next year I earned $600,000. After
1981,1 never earned less than seven figures. I remember talking to a good friend of mine in 1979
and saying, "I don't think anybody can make $40,000 a month trading options." Now I can do that
in a day without a problem.
You were doing very well on the floor. Why did you leave?
It was very slow during lunchtime in those years. I used to go to an upstairs office to eat my lunch.
While I was at my desk eating a sandwich, I would do my charts and look for different ideas. I
came to realize that I could see much more sitting at the desk, looking at a machine, than being at a
post, trading an option. On the floor, the specialists chose the symbols they wanted to keep on the
quote machines, because they paid the rent on them. So you always had to run around to find what
you wanted to see. I felt much more comfortable upstairs.
About a year and a half later, after I started earning a lot of money, the floor wasn't big enough.
There was a much bigger arena to play in. Another reason for my move was the fact that, in 1981, a
change in the tax laws made it more lucrative to trade futures than stocks and options.
In my futures trading, I didn't try to make two one year, four the next, eight the next, etc. I didn't
earn significantly more in my futures trading in 1987 than I did in 1982, because I used my profits
to invest in real estate and other things to enhance the quality of my life.
I was broke in the 1970s, and I never wanted to be broke again. My philosophy was that if you
make money every month, nothing bad is going to happen to you. So, you won't be the richest
person. You'll never be the richest person anyway. What difference does it make? I'm proud of my
futures trading, because I took $40,000 and ran it up to about $20 million with never more than a 3
percent drawdown.
Did you continue trading stocks during this period?
Yes, but with a different mentality. I traded stocks from a little longer time horizon. I don't feel the
same pressure when I own 100,000 shares of stock as when I own 100 S&Ps.
Will you trade stocks as readily from the short side as the long side?
No, I find it harder to trade stocks from the short side.
Because of the uptick rule?
No, it is just easier to short the S&P, because you get so much more bang for the buck. Also, I hate
the specialist system; they are always trying to con you to death. I'll give you my view on
specialists: Never in my life have I met a less talented group of people who make a
disproportionately large amount of money relative to their skills. Having the specialist book is the
most extraordinary advantage one could ever ask for. In normal markets, the specialists can always
define their risk. If they have a bid for 20,000 down \ they can buy the stock, knowing they can
always get out'/«lower. So, they are protected. I always tell my friends to have their daughters
marry the son of a specialist.
I can't stand most established institutions. I have a me-against-them mentality, which I believe
helps me be a better, more aggressive trader. It helps as long as I maintain an intellectual bias in my
work and discipline in money management.
What was your experience during the week of the October 19 stock crash?
I came in long. I have thought about it, and I would do the same thing again. Why? Because on
October 16, the market fell 108 points, which, at the time, was the biggest one-day point decline in
the history of the stock exchange. It looked climactic to me, and I thought that was a buying
opportunity. The only problem was that it was a Friday. Usually a down Friday is followed by a

                     PAGE 130                     
==================================================

down Monday.
I don't think Monday would have been nearly as bad as it was, if Treasury Secretary James Baker
had not started verbally bludgeoning the Germans about interest rates over the weekend. He was so
belligerent. Once I heard Baker, I knew I was dead.
So, you knew that you were in trouble over the weekend?
Yes. Also, Marty Zweig, who is a friend of mine, was on "Wall Street Week" on Friday evening,
talking about a possible depression. I called Marty the next day, and he said he thought there was
another 500 points risk in the market. Of course, he didn't know it was going to happen in one day.
What made him so bearish at the time?
I think his monetary indicators were terribly negative. Remember, the bonds were sinking rapidly at
the time.
What happened that Monday? When did you get out?
The high in the S&P on Monday was 269.1 liquidated my long position at 267'/2.1 was real proud
of that because it is very hard to pull the trigger on a loser. I just dumped everything. I think I was
long 40 contracts coming into that day, and I lost $315,000.
One of the most suicidal tilings you can do in trading is to keep adding to a losing position. Had I
done that, I could have lost $5 million that day. It was painful, and I was bleeding, but I honored
my risk points and bit the bullet.
That's another example where my Marine training came into play. They teach you never to freeze
when you are under attack. One of the tactics in the Marine Corps officer's manual is either go
forward or backward. Don't just sit there if you are getting the hell beat out of you. Even retreating
is offensive, because you are still doing something. It is the same thing in the market. The most
important thing is to keep enough powder to make your comeback. I did real well after October 19.
In fact, 1987 was my most profitable year.
You liquidated your long position very well on October 19. Did you think about actually
going short?
I thought about it, but I said to myself, "Now is not the time to worry about making money; it is the
time to worry about keeping what you have made." Whenever there is a really rough period, I try to
play defense, defense, defense. I believe in protecting what you have.
The day of the crash, 1 got out of most of my positions and protected my family. Then at 1:30
P.M., with the Dow down 275 points, I went to my safe deposit box and took my gold out. Half an
hour later, I went to another bank and started writing checks to get my cash out. I started buying
Treasury bills and preparing for the worst. I had never seen anything like what was going on.
You were seriously worried about the banks going under?
Why not? The stories I heard, subsequently, from people on the operations side of the business
would have stopped the hearts of the public if they had known what was going on. The banks
weren't meeting any of the calls at the brokerage firms. On Tuesday morning, we were within hours
of the whole thing totally collapsing. So my caution was well advised.
I think my fear of a depression is related to my father graduating college in 1929. If you talk to
people who got out of college at that time, it is as though a ten-year period is missing from their
lives. There was just nothing substantial going on in this country. That always stuck with me,
because I feared it so much. I think that is one of the reasons why I don't try to increase my
earnings geometrically. On the day of the crash, when I looked at my son in his crib, I thought, I
don't want him ever to ask me, "Dad, why didn't you do everything you could have done?"
When did you start trading again?
Wednesday of that week. It was funny because I started out trading only one or two S&P contracts
at a time. The S&P was trading in full point increments [equivalent to $500 per contract, compared
to $25 for a minimum tick], and I didn't know how to handicap what was going on. From past
experiences, I knew we were in some sort of opportunity period, but they were rewriting the rale
book. My attitude is: Never risk your family's security. I didn't need to make any more money at
that point. On Wednesday, the market got up to an area where I thought it should be shorted. I

==================================================
                     PAGE 131                     
==================================================

ended Wednesday short twelve S&P contracts, which for me was a miniscule position.
That night, Bob Prechter [editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist, a widely followed advisory letter] put
out a negative hotline message. The next morning, the market was under tremendous pressure,
partially because of that recommendation, but mainly because one of the biggest fund managers in
the country was trying to liquidate a monster long position. It has been stated that he lost $800
million during that period.
I called the S&P pit just before the opening that morning, and my clerk said, "Decembers are
offered at 230, offered at 220, offered at 210, trading at 200 even." I yelled, "Cover!" I made a
quarter of a million dollars on twelve contracts! It was one of the most memorable trades of my
life.
What are your thoughts about program trading? [See Appendix 1 for definition.]
I hate it. There used to be a natural ebb and flow in the market, but program trading killed it. Those
firms doing program trading wield extraordinary power to move the market, and the locals have
simply become accomplices. I'm not just paranoid, because I've adjusted to it and been successful.
But I hate it.
Some people say that all this criticism of program trading is a bunch of nonsense.
Well, they are idiots.
No, some of them are very intelligent people.
No, they are idiots. I can prove to any one of them that they are idiots.
How do you prove it?
There is something I would like the regulators to investigate. The market closes near the high or
low of the day much more frequently than it used to. During the last two years, the market has
closed within 2 percent of the high or low of the day about 20 percent of the time. Mathematically,
that type of distribution is impossible by chance.
You talk about program trading as if it is immoral. What is unethical about trading stocks
against futures?
Because the program traders also have the other side of the equation to do. You have the so-called
Chinese wall in investment banking, where they don't want the arbitrageurs and investment bankers
on the same floor for fear they might talk to each other. Well, I would like the SEC to explain to me
how they can allow agency program traders sitting alongside principal traders for the firm's own
account.
Your example introduces an element of frontrunning, which obscures the basic question.
What I am trying to get at is: What is immoral about buying stock and selling futures (or the
reverse trade) because prices in the two markets are out of line?
Because I've seen situations in which a firm has information about a debt/equity swap a day ahead
of time. For example, when the state of New Jersey sold $2 billion worth of stock and moved it into
the bonds, this firm knew about it the day before. Since they knew they were going to be selling $2
billion worth of stock the next day, from 4:00 to 4:15, they sold thousands of futures contracts to
set up the trade. That stinks.
The example you just gave is (a) a case of trading on inside information, (b) frontrunning,
and (c) an outright trade. It is not a program trade. Let me give you an example. Let's say a
trading firm has a computer program that signals when stocks are overpriced or un-
derpriced relative to futures, and they are not doing any customer business—
Let me give you an example first. If these brokerage firms need an 80-cent discount to take off a
customer program, they will take off their own position at a 50-cent discount. They have the edge
and can ran in front of their clients because their transaction costs are lower—they're not paying
commissions to themselves.
I keep trying to separate these things out. Let's take an example where there is no
frontrunning or customer business—just somebody trading their own money, trying to take
out an arbitrage profit. If that is their methodology, why is it any worse than your
131



==================================================
                     PAGE 132                     
==================================================

methodology?
Because it is a dumb game. Anybody who puts on a basket of stocks to earn 80 basis points above
the T-bill yield is an idiot! They are the same idiots I tried to get away from when I left security
analysis. Who the hell needs to earn 80 basis points over Treasury bills? The brokerage firms sell
them this bill of goods because it is a way of creating more order flow, which on Wall Street today
has become the ultimate power.
Are you saying program trading is wrong, even for some entity that is not trading customer
money?
I grew up being a security analyst, analyzing things and buying something for value. Trading stocks
against stock index futures, in and out, serves no useful purpose.
They are buying and selling, and you are buying and selling. What's the difference?
I am trying to earn infinity when I trade.
What makes that style any more right than the style which is trying to arbitrage the market?
I guess it is their constitutional right and they are able to do it, but there are some incredible abuses
as a consequence. I scream at the kids who work for these brokerage firms: "You SOBs have no
integrity, no ethics! You know what will happen? You are going to kill the game." Now they are
swearing at me. When they stopped doing proprietary program trading they said, "Are you happy?
You got your wish!" I said, "No, it is not quite finished yet." I didn't tell them the conclusion, which
comes when they are no longer earning $300,000 or more a year, and they find out what they are
really worth; when they are hitting the bricks and can't get a job for $50,000. Then it will have
come full circle.
Speaking of circles, we seem to be moving in one on this subject. Let's go on. What stands out
as your most dramatic trading experience?
The most gut-wrenching time was in November 1982. I had a much smaller net worth then, and I
took a $600,000 loss in one day.
What happened?
It was Election Day, and the Republicans did much better than expected in the congressional races.
The market ran up 43 points, which at that time was one of the largest point advances in history. I
was short, and like an imbecile, I sold more with the S&P locked at the 500-point limit against me
and less than an hour left in the trading session.
My wife, who was working with me at the time, was out that day. The next day she came into
work, and every ten minutes she would say, "Get smaller, get smaller." I kept taking losses, just
getting out of the position.
Whenever you get hit, you are very upset emotionally. Most traders try to make it back
immediately; they try to play bigger. Whenever you try to get all your losses back at once, you are
most often doomed to fail. That is true in everything—investments, trading, gambling. I learned
from the crap table at Las Vegas to keep only X dollars in my pocket and never to have any credit,
because the worst thing you can do is to send good money after bad. If you can physically remove
yourself from the premises, which is the same thing in futures trading as getting flat, you can see
things in a whole different perspective.
After a devastating loss, I always play very small and try to get black ink, black ink. It's not how
much money I make, but just getting my rhythm and confidence back. I shrink my size totally—to
a fifth or a tenth of the position that I trade normally. And it works. I think I ended up losing only
$57,000 in November 1982, after taking a $600,000 hit on November 4.
Is there any trading mistake that you could isolate as responsible for that Election Day, 1982,
loss?
Adding to shorts when the futures market is already locked-limit against you and the cash market
looks like it is 200 points higher is pretty stupid.
When you look back, do you say, "Why did I do it?"
I think because I had huge gains the month before. I've always had my biggest setbacks after my
biggest victories. I was careless.
132



==================================================
                     PAGE 133                     
==================================================

Do you still make trading mistakes? By that, I mean deviations from trading principles you
consider valid—not losing trades.
You always make trading mistakes. I made one just recently—a terrible mistake. I was short the
S&P and short the bonds, and I got nervous be- cause the bonds moved above their moving
average. However, T-bills had not followed suit. One of my rules is not to have a position when my
moving averages in T-bills and bonds diverge—that is, when one moving average is above the
price and the other below—because interest rates can't move very far until one confirms the
movement of the other. According to my rales, I should have moved my bond position from short
to flat; instead, I reversed from short to long. I paid dearly for that mistake. Whereas, I had lost
only about $20,000 on my original short position, the next day I had a six-figure loss—my largest
loss of the year.
The great thing about being a trader is that you can always do a much better job. No matter how
successful you are, you know how many times you screw up. Most people, in most careers, are
busy trying to cover up their mistakes. As a trader, you are forced to confront your mistakes
because the numbers don't lie.
From time to time, you have alluded to your trading rules. Can you list them?
[Reading from a list and extemporizing] I always check my charts and the moving averages prior to
taking a position. Is the price above or below the moving average? That works better than any tool I
have. I try not to go against the moving averages; it is self-destructive.
Has a stock held above its most recent low, when the market has penetrated its most recent low? If
so, that stock is much healthier than the market. Those are the types of divergences I always look
for.
Before putting on a position always ask, "Do I really want to have this position?"
After a successful period, take a day off as a reward. I've found it difficult to sustain excellent
trading for more than two weeks at a time. I've had periods where I can be profitable for twelve
days in a row, but eventually you just get battle fatigue. So, after a strong run of profits, I try to
play smaller rather than larger. My biggest losses have always followed my largest profits.
This next rale is a major problem for me; I'm always trying not to break it. The rale: Bottom fishing
is one of the most expensive forms of gambling. It's OK to break this rale on occasion if you have
sufficient justification. For example, today, I bought the S&Ps when they were down sharply. Two
weeks ago, I had written down the number 248.45 as the best entry for the S&P. The low today was
248.50. Consequently, I was able to buy into weakness today and make a good deal of money. I had
a plan, I carried it out, and it worked. It doesn't always work. It was risky, but I wasn't pyramiding
wildly into it, and I knew how much I was risking.
That brings me to my next rule: Before taking a position, always know the amount you are willing
to lose. Know your "uncle point" and honor it. I have a pain threshold, and if I reach that point, I
must get out.
When T-bonds and T-bills differ in respect to their individual relationship between price and the
moving average—one above the moving average, the other below—have no position until one
confirms the direction of the other. [Generally speaking, a price above its moving average implies a
price uptrend, while the reverse case implies a price downtrend.]
Then, the last words I have at the bottom of the page are: Work, work, and more work.
Is there anything to add to that list?
The most important thing is money management, money management, money management.
Anybody who is successful will tell you the same thing.
The one area that I am constantly trying to improve on is to let my gains ran. I'm not able to do that
well. I'm always working on it. To my dying day, I'll probably still be working on it.
Is that because you do something wrong?
I just love to take profits. I hear music when the cash register rings. The irony is: How can I be
willing to risk 400 points on the downside and only take 200 points of a 1,000-point move on the
upside?
On the risk side, you have a method, a plan. Have you experimented with trying to use
133



==================================================
                     PAGE 134                     
==================================================

similar discipline on the profit side?
Yes, but I haven't been able to perfect it. I have had varying degrees of success, but it is my greatest
criticism of myself.
Why the difficulty in this area?
I think it all relates to my fears of some cataclysmic event. I'm like W. C. Fields: I have several
bank accounts and a few safe deposit boxes with gold and cash. I'm extremely well diversified. My
thought process is that if I screw up in one place, I'll always have a life preserver someplace else.
Any other rules you can think of?
Yes. If you're ever very nervous about a position overnight, and especially over a weekend, and
you're able to get out at a much better price than you thought possible when the market trades,
you're usually better off staying with the position. For example, the other day I was short the S&P
and got nervous because the bond market was very strong on the night session. The next morning,
the stock market was virtually unchanged. I was so relieved that I could get out without a loss, I
covered my position. That was a mistake. A little later that day, the S&P collapsed. When your
worst fears aren't realized, you probably should increase your position.
What has been your worst drawdown percentage wise?
My records were just evaluated for a money management deal. Over my entire career as a full-time
trader, based on month-end data, my biggest drawdown was 3 percent. I had my worst two months
around the birth of my two children, because I was worried about whether I was going to get the
tennis ball in the right place in Lamaze class.
My philosophy has always been to try to be profitable every single month. I even try to be
profitable every single day. And I've had some extraordinary runs—over 90 percent of my months
have been profitable. I'm particularly proud of the fact that, in virtually every year, I didn't have a
losing month before April. I probably don't make as much money as I could because of that, but I'm
more concerned about controlling the downside.
You start off every year with a clean slate?
That's my philosophy: January 1, I'm poor.
Do you trade smaller in January?
Not necessarily. It is just that my attention is greater.
Do you take your losses more quickly in January?
No, I always take my losses quickly. That is probably the key to my success. You can always put
the trade back on, but if you go flat, you see things differently.
Greater clarity?
Much greater clarity because the pressure you feel when you are in a position that is not working
puts you in a catatonic state.
Getting back to managed money, I wonder, after years of making plenty of money trading on
your own, what possible motive could you have for bothering with managing other people's
money?
I felt that I was getting a little stale, and this presents a whole new challenge. Also, after October
1987,1 realized that downside risk can't be adequately measured. The way to get more personal
leverage is with an outside pool of money.
How much money are you going to be managing?
I don't want to be specific about the amount, but I'm only taking on one or two large pools of
money. I don't want to deal with multiple investors, even though I'm certain I could raise a great
deal more money if I went with a public underwriting.
The more people you have involved, the more potential headaches. For example, when I met a
large fund manager, he asked me how many employees I had. I told him, "None." He told me he
had seventy. When he wants to quit, it will be more difficult because he'll have their lives in his
hands. I don't want that kind of pressure.
You seem rather isolated here. Do you like working alone?
134



==================================================
                     PAGE 135                     
==================================================

It took me several years to be able to accept working alone. I used to go to a downtown office
because a lot of my friends were there. But, as time passed and fewer of those people were still
there, the attraction diminished significantly. Now, I have half a dozen people I talk to on the phone
daily. I've taught my methodologies to a number of them, and they have methodologies of their
own.
Have you ever tried training people to be traders working for you?
I hired four people, but nobody lasted. They all became intimidated. I tried to clone myself and it
didn't work. I taught them all my methodologies, but learning the intellectual side is only part of it.
You can't teach them your stomach.
Why do most traders lose money?
Because they would rather lose money than admit they're wrong. What is the ultimate
rationalization of a trader in a losing position? "I'll get out when I'm even." Why is getting out even
so important? Because it protects the ego. I became a winning trader when I was able to say, "To
hell with my ego, making money is more important."
What do you tell people who seek your advice?
I always try to encourage people that are thinking of going into this business for themselves. I tell
them, "Think that you might become more successful than you ever dreamt, because that's what
happened to me." I have the freedom I always wanted, both financially and structurally. I can go on
vacation at any moment. I live in Westhampton Beach half of the year and in New York the other
half. I have a wonderful lifestyle. My kids think all fathers work at home.
What is the best advice you can give to the ordinary guy trying to become a better trader?
Learn to take losses. The most important thing in making money is not letting your losses get out of
hand. Also, don't increase your position size until you have doubled or tripled your capital. Most
people make the mistake of increasing their bets as soon as they start making money. That is a
quick way to get wiped out.
Marty Schwartz's story should encourage those whose initial attempts at trading have met with
failure. Here is a trader who was unsuccessful over a ten-year period, managing to lose enough
money to keep himself near broke, despite consistently earning good salaries. Yet, Schwartz was
eventually able to turn things around and become one of the world's best traders.
How did he do it? There were two essential elements. First, he found a methodology that worked
for him. Throughout his losing years, Schwartz used fundamental analysis to determine his trades.
It was not until he immersed himself in technical analysis that he became successful. The point here
is not that technical analysis is better than fundamental analysis, but rather that technical analysis
was the methodology that was right for him. Some of the other traders interviewed in this book,
such as James Rogers, have been very successful using fundamental analysis to the complete
exclusion of technical analysis. The key lesson is that each trader must find his or her own best
approach.
The second element behind Schwartz's transition to success was a change in attitude. As he
describes it, he became successful when his desire to win took precedence over his desire to be
right.
Risk control is an essential element of Schwartz's trading style, as attested to by his incredibly low
drawdowns. He achieves this risk control by always knowing his "uncle point" on any trade. No
doubt, his approach of sharply reducing position size after large losses, as well as extended winning
streaks, contributes heavily to his success. The rationale for reducing position size after a
destabilizing loss is apparent.
However, the reason for taking the same action after a winning streak deserves further elaboration.
As Schwartz explains it, he has always experienced his biggest losses after his biggest gains. I
suspect this is true for the majority of traders. Winning streaks lead to complacency, and
complacency leads to sloppy trading.
Most traders cite similar rules (such as discipline and hard work) as the reasons for their success.
Therefore, it is always a treat when a top trader provides a rule that is unique and rings true. I was
fascinated with Schwartz's observation about maintaining a position that you are worried about,
135

when the market action doesn't justify your fears. The implicit concept is that if the market is
letting you off the hook easily on a position for which there was a basis for fear (such as a
fundamental development adverse to the position or a technical breakout in the opposite direction),
there must be strong underlying forces in favor of the direction of the original position.

James B. Rogers, Jr.-Buying Value and Selling Hysteria
Jim Rogers began trading the stock market with a paltry $600 in 1968. In 1973, he formed the
Quantum Fund with partner George Soros. The Quantum Fund proved to be one of the best-
performing hedge funds, and in 1980, having amassed a small fortune, Rogers retired. "Retired" is
the word Rogers uses to describe the management of his personal portfolio, an endeavor that
requires considerable ongoing research. His retirement also includes teaching investment courses at
the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.
I was eager to interview Rogers because of his stellar reputation as one of the shrewdest investors
of our time and because his comments on television financial interview shows and in the print
media always seemed to strike a note of common sense with rare clarity. Since I did not know
Rogers, I sent him a letter requesting an interview, explaining that I was working on a book on
great traders. I included a copy of my previous book on the futures markets, which I inscribed with
a quotation from Voltaire that I deemed particularly appropriate: "Common sense is not so
common."
Rogers called a few days later to thank me for the book and to indicate his willingness to
participate. "However," he cautioned, "I am probably not the person you want to interview. I often
hold positions for many years. Furthermore, I'm probably one of the world's worst traders. I never
get in at the right time." He was referring to the distinction I had made in my letter, indicating that I
was interested in great traders rather than great investors.
As I use the term, a "trader" would be primarily concerned with which direction the stock market
was heading, while an "investor" would concentrate on selecting stocks with the best chance of
outperforming the market overall. In other words, the investor was always long, while the trader
might be long or short. I explained my use of these terms to Rogers and stressed that he was indeed
the type of person I wished to interview.
I arrived at Rogers' home, a baronial, eclectically furnished townhouse, on a fall-like spring
afternoon. The atmosphere seemed more reminiscent of a comfortable English manor than a home
in New York City. In fact, if my only exposure to New York City was that afternoon's conversation
with Rogers in his antique-filled sitting room, with its pleasant views of the Hudson, I would
conclude that New York City was an eminently peaceful place to live. After greeting me, Rogers
immediately stated, "I still think you have the wrong man." Once again, he was referring to the fact
that he did not consider himself to be a trader. This is the note on which the following interview
begins.
As I told you in our phone conversation, I don't consider myself a trader. I remember when I went
to buy German stocks in 1982,1 said to the broker, "I want you to buy me X, Y, and Z stocks." The
broker, who didn't know me, asked, "What do I do next?" I said, "You buy the stocks and send me
the confirmations." He asked, "Do you want me to send you some research?" I said, "Please don't
do that." He asked, "Do you want me to send you opinions?" I said, "No, no, don't." He asked, "Do
you want me to call you with prices?" I said, "No, don't even give me prices, because if you do,
once I see that these stocks have doubled and tripled, I might be tempted to sell them. I plan to own
German stocks for at least three years, because I think you are about to have the biggest bull market
you've had in two or three generations." Needless to say, the broker was dumbfounded; he thought I
was a madman.
Now I don't consider that trading; it was determining that there was about to be a major change in a
market and taking a position. By the way, I got that one right. I bought the German stocks at the
end of 1982 and sold them out in late 1985 and early 1986.
What made you so bullish on Germany at that time?
The bull market had started here in August 1982. More important, Germany had not had any kind
of bull market since the previous all-time high in 1961, twenty-one years earlier. The German
market had crumbled in 1962 and had essentially gone sideways since then. In the meantime, the
German economy had boomed. So there was basic value there.
Whenever I buy or sell something, I always try to make sure I'm not going to lose any money first.
If there is very good value, then I'm probably not going to lose much money even if I'm wrong.
139



==================================================
                     PAGE 140                     
==================================================

But you could have bought that market ten years earlier on the same theory.
That's absolutely right. You could have bought it in 1971 for exactly those reasons and watched
German stocks sit for ten years, while we had a major bull market in the U.S. But this time there
was a catalyst. You always need a catalyst to make big things happen. At the time, the catalyst was
the upcoming German elections. I figured the Socialists were going to be thrown out, and I knew
that the opposition party, the Christian Democrats, had a platform designed to encourage
investment.
My basic assessment was that if the conservative Christian Democrats won the election after having
been out of power for so many years, they were going to make major changes. I also knew that
many German companies were holding back from investing in capital equipment and expansion in
1982 in anticipation of a conservative victory. Therefore, if the conservatives did win, there would
be a real explosion of pent-up capital investment.
Was the election a toss-up at the time?
Not in my mind.
I mean in terms of the polls.
I guess so, because when the conservatives did win, the market exploded flmt same day.
What if they had lost?
I still didn't think I would have lost any meaningful money for the reasons I mentioned before. I
had every anticipation that there was going to be a major change, and that the bull market would
last for two, three, or four years.
It sounds like you have a great deal of conviction when you put on a trade.
Yes, I usually do; otherwise, I don't bother doing it. One of the best rales anybody can learn about
investing is to do nothing, absolutely nothing, unless there is something to do. Most people—not
that I'm better than most people—always have to be playing; they always have to be doing
something. They make a big play and say, "Boy, am I smart, I just tripled my money." Then they
rash out and have to do something else with that money. They can't just sit there and wait for
something new to develop.
Do you always wait for a situation to line up in your favor? Don't you ever say, "I think this
market is probably going to go up, so I'll give it a shot"?
What you just described is a very fast way to the poorhouse. I just wait until there is money lying in
the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up. I do nothing in the meantime. Even
people who lose money in the market say, "I just lost my money, now I have to do something to
make it back." No, you don't. You should sit there until you find something.
Trade as little as possible.
That is why I don't think of myself as a trader. I think of myself as someone who waits for
something to come along. I wait for a situation that is like the proverbial "shooting fish in a barrel."
Are all your trades fundamentally oriented?
Yes. Occasionally, however, the Commodity Research Bureau charts will provide a catalyst.
Sometimes the chart for a market will show an incredible spike either up or down. You will see
hysteria in the charts. When I see hysteria, I usually like to take a look to see if I shouldn't be going
the other way.
Can you think of any examples?
Yes. Two years ago, I went short soybeans after they had gone straight up to $9.60. The reason I
remember it so vividly is because that same evening, I went to dinner with a group of traders, one
of whom was talking about all the reasons why he had bought soybeans. I said, "I really can't tell
you why all the bullish arguments are wrong; all I know is that I'm shorting hysteria."
How do you pick the time to go against the hysteria?
I wait until the market starts moving in gaps.
In the midst of it all, or do you wait for some sign of an end to the move, for example, a
reversal day?
140



==================================================
                     PAGE 141                     
==================================================

No, I don't know about reversal days.
That brings to mind a classic example of hysteria. In late 1979-early 1980, the gold market
witnessed an incredible accelerated advance. Did you go short that market?
Yes, I sold gold at $675.
That was almost $200 too early!
I told you I'm not a good trader. I'm nearly always too early, but it was only about four days before
the top.
I didn't say you were way off timewise, but pricewise it must have been a pretty scary ride.
When you do a trade like that, isn't there a point where you have second thoughts?
Yes, when it goes to $676 [he laughs].
But you stayed with the trade?
Yes, in that case, because it was chaos. It was something that couldn't last. It was the gold market's
dying gasp.
Was that a matter of recognizing the fingerprint of a market in its final blowoff, or was it a
matter of gold being overpriced?
Both. Gold was overpriced, but basically it was—I like your terminology—the "fingerprint" of
hysteria. Just about every time you go against panic, you will be right if you can stick it out.
So when you see panic, do you automatically go against it?
The panic, the hysteria, in and of itself is only a catalyst to make me look to see what is going on. It
doesn't mean I'm going to do anything. In the case of the early 1980 gold market, I had a view of
the world that was bearish for gold. Volcker had just become the Federal Reserve Chairman a few
months earlier and said that we were going to beat inflation. I believed he meant it. I also happened
to be bearish on oil at the time, and I knew that if oil went down, gold would go down as well.
Was that because you thought gold and oil should move together, or because you thought the
rest of the world believed that?
At that time, everybody in the world believed that.
But, did you believe that the relationship was true?
I knew that it was not true.
The reason I asked is that I have always felt that the relationship between gold and oil was a
coincidental correlation.
Yes, that was all it was. For one very short period of time, gold and oil moved together.
Does that mean you will sometimes do a trade based on a relationship you know doesn't
really make any sense, simply because you think that the rest of the world believes it?
Rarely. I usually like to look at what I think is the fact, the truth. The main item then was that I
thought Volcker meant it when he said he was going to break the back of inflation. The fact that oil
was ready to go down anyway was just the kicker.
Actually, the decisive step came in October 1979, when the Fed changed its policy from
controlling interest rates to controlling money supply growth. Yet the gold market apparently
didn't believe it, because it went up for several months after that point. In situations like that,
are the markets too wound up in their hysteria to pay attention to changing fundamentals?
Absolutely. It is ama/ing how sometimes something important will happen, and the market will
keep going despite that. Now, I am experienced enough to know that just because I see something
doesn't mean that everyone sees it. A lot of people are going to keep buying or selling just because
that has been the thing to do.
So, just because the market doesn't respond to some important news, such as the October
1979 change in Fed policy, doesn't mean that it isn't important.
All the better. If the market keeps going the way it shouldn't go, especially if it is a hysterical
blowoff, then you know an opportunity will present itself.
141



==================================================
                     PAGE 142                     
==================================================

Can you think of a more recent example?
Yes, October 1987. October 19 is my birthday, by the way. At the end of 1986 and the beginning of
1987,1 had predicted that we would have one more big move up in the stock market and then
witness the worst bear market since 1937. But I didn't know it was going to happen on my birthday.
It was the best birthday present I ever had.
Did you have any idea that the break could be as large as it was?
When John Train interviewed me in January 1987,1 told him, "Somewhere along the way, the
market is going to go down 300 points in one day." He looked at me as though I were a madman. I
envisioned that the Dow would be around 3,000, and 300 points would only be 10 percent. In 1929,
the market went down 12 percent in one day. Ten percent in one day was not such a big move,
given the kind of markets we were having then. The market had already seen a number of 3,4, and
5 percent days. So I said, "Why can't the market go down 300 points in a day?" Little did I know it
would be 508 points.
Why did you pick 1937 as a comparison in your prediction for a stock market collapse?
Because in 1937, the Dow went down 49 percent in six months. What I was trying to say was that
we were going to have a major, fast, deep, horrible collapse, as opposed to say 1973-1974, when
the market went down 50 percent, but it took two years.
Why did you use 1937 as an analogy as opposed to 1929-1930?
Because 1929-1930 went on to be a major depression. I knew we were going to have a bear market
caused by a major financial collapse. I was not convinced we were going to have a depression. I
was differentiating between a financial and economic collapse.
Why were you expecting a financial collapse?
It was the atmosphere. Money was flooding the world. Every stock market in the world was at an
all-time high. You had all these stories of young guys, three years out of school, making half a
million dollars a year. That is not reality. Whenever you see that in a market, you are near a top. So,
I went into the summer positioned for a collapse.
Were you short stocks or long puts?
I was short stocks and short calls. I don't buy options. Buying options is another fast way to the
poorhouse. Someone did a study for the SEC and discovered that 90 percent of all options expire as
losses. Well, I figured out that if 90 percent of all long option positions lose money, that meant that
90 percent of all short option positions make money. If I want to use options to be bearish, I sell
calls.
When did you cover your positions?
During the week of October 19. If you remember, by that time, everybody thought that the financial
structure of America was over.
Did you cover then because we had hysteria going the other way?
That is exactly right. That week was a textbook case of hysteria. Under those kind of conditions, if
you are still solvent, you have to step in there and go against it. Maybe that was going to be the one
time it was the end of the world, and I would have been wiped out too. But 95 percent of the time
when you go against that kind of hysteria, you are going to make money.
Between October 1987 and January 1988,1 didn't have any shorts. That was one of the few times in
my whole life that I didn't have any shorts. Whether I am bullish or bearish, I always try to have
both long and short positions—just in case I'm wrong. Even in the best of times, there is always
somebody fouling up, and even in the worst of times, there is somebody doing well.
Are you implying that after the collapse, you couldn't find any stocks you wanted to be short?
I thought that if I were right and the world wasn't coming to an end right away, everything was
going to go up—including those stocks that I knew, fundamentally, were coming apart at the
seams. In January [ 1988], I started putting a couple of shorts back on, and even though I am losing
money on one of those shorts, I am happy to do it because I feel more comfortable having the
protection of some short positions.
142



==================================================
                     PAGE 143                     
==================================================

A lot of people blame the October 1987 break on program trading. Do you consider that
scapegoatism?
Absolutely. The people who blame it on that do not understand the market. Politicians and people
who lose money always look for scapegoats. In 1929, they blamed the crash on short sellers and
margin requirements. There were lots of good reasons why the stock market went down. What they
should focus on is why there were sellers on October 19, but no buyers.
I remember why I became even more bearish on the weekend before October 19. The week before,
[Federal Reserve Chairman] Alan Greenspan announced that the balance of trade was getting much
better and things were under control. Two days later, the balance of trade figures came out, and
they were the worst in the history of the world. Right away I said, "This guy is either a fool or a
liar. He doesn't have any idea what is going on." Then on the weekend before October 19, you had
[Treasury Secretary] Baker telling the world we were going to stick it to the Germans by letting the
dollar go, because the Germans weren't loosening monetary and fiscal policy as Baker had
demanded. It looked like the trade wars of the 1930s all over again.
I was in a panic—and I was already short! I called Singapore that Sunday night to add to my shorts.
[Singapore opens earlier than we do.] So all those guys who came in on Monday to sell had very,
very good reasons to sell, and there were no buyers around. There were no buyers, because there
was no reason for people to buy. Even the buyers were scared and bearish that Monday.
Are you saying the crash was caused by Greenspan and Baker?
There were a lot of causes: Greenspan, Baker, the fact that money was tight, the steady worsening
of the balance of trade, and you had a market that had spiked up to 2,700 six weeks earlier. If you
check, you will see that, during 1987, while the S&P and the Dow were going up, the rest of the
market was quietly eroding away. In December 1986,1 shorted the financial stocks, and throughout
1987,1 didn't lose any money, even though the Dow and the S&P were going through the roof.
Were there any times you faded hysteria and lost?
Yes, one of my greatest lessons happened in my early days and taught me about bear markets. In
January 1970, a time when I still bought options, I took all the money I had—which wasn't very
much—and bought puts. In May 1970, the market caved in, and the day the market hit bottom, I
sold my puts. I had tripled my money. I was a genius! "I'm going to be the next Bernard Baruch," I
said to myself.
My plan then was to wait for the market to rally and this time to sell short instead of buying puts so
that I would make money faster. Sure enough the market rallied, and I took everything I had and
went short. Needless to say, two months later, I was completely wiped out because I didn't know
what I was doing.
One of the stocks I had shorted was Memorex. I sold Memorex at 48. In those days, I didn't have
the staying power—psychologically, emotionally, and, most important, financially. I ended up
covering my shorts at 72. Memorex eventually went to about 96 and then went straight down to 2.
I was dead right, absolutely, flat-out, perfectly right to short that stock at 48.1 just ended up getting
completely wiped out. The market didn't care that I was dead right. That is one of the reasons that I
now know about hysteria.
What did you learn from that particular experience?
That the market is going to go higher than I think it can and lower than I think it will. I had a
tendency to think that if I knew something, everybody knew it. I would just read things in the
paper; I didn't have any inside information. What I now know is that they don't know what I know.
Most people don't have the foresight to look six months, one year, or two years out. The Memorex
experience taught me that anything can happen in the stock market, because there are a lot of
people in the market who don't understand what is going on.
Are you looking for a very pronounced bear market beyond what we have already seen?
Yes, eventually I expect the market to break the October 1987 low.
Do you expect a very deep recession as well?
Right now [April 1988], I'm still looking mainly for a financial collapse. However, the politicians
may foul it up and turn it into an economic collapse.
143



==================================================
                     PAGE 144                     
==================================================

Can we get a financial collapse without actually having a very serious recession?
Sure. It has happened lots of times. That is why I used 1937 as an example before. I don't expect
the economy to collapse because as the dollar keeps getting weaker—which is what I expect—
many parts of the American economy will do well—steel, agriculture, textiles, mining.
So even if the stock market falls below the October low, you can still see the economy doing
well?
Absolutely. Unless the politicians foul it up.
By doing what?
Raising taxes, tariffs, protectionism. There are lots of things the politicians can do to foul it up, and
I'm sure they will—they always have. I know we will have a financial crisis. And, if the politicians
get it wrong, we may get an economic collapse as well.
What is going to trigger the financial collapse?
The trade figures will start getting worse again, and this will eventually precipitate another dollar
crisis.
What do you see as the main cause of the trade deficit?
The budget deficit, by and large, causes the trade deficit. You are not going to get rid of the trade
deficit until you get rid of the budget deficit.
Given the magnitude of the deficit problem, is there anything that can be done at this point?
The basic problem in the world today is that America is consuming more than it is saving. You
need to do everything you can to encourage saving and investment: Eliminate taxation of savings,
the capital gains tax, and dual taxation of dividends; bring back the more attractive incentives for
IRAs, Keoghs, and 401Ks. At the same time, you need to do everything you can to discourage
consumption. Change our tax structure to utilize a value added tax, which taxes consumption rather
than saving and investing. Cut government spending dramatically—and there are lots of ways of
doing it without hurting the economy too badly. We would have problems, but the problems would
not be nearly as bad as when they are forced on us. If we don't bite the bullet, then we are going to
have a 1930s-type collapse.
Your answer implies that there are relatively painless ways to cut government spending
"dramatically." Could you provide some specific examples?
I'll give you two examples; I could give you a dozen. The U.S. government spends $5 billion a year
to support the domestic price of sugar so that Americans can pay 22 cents a pound wholesale, when
it is selling for 8 cents a pound in the world market. Five billion dollars! We would be better off if
the government told every sugar grower, "We'll give you $100,000 a year for the rest of your life, a
condominium, and a Porsche if you just get out of the sugar business." We would save billions of
dollars a year, and the whole country would be better off because we would all be paying less for
sugar.
If you really want to save a big number, do you know what our annual balance of trade deficit is?
One hundred and fifty billion dollars. Do you know what it costs us each year to keep American
troops stationed in Europe? One hundred and fifty billion dollars. American troops were sent there
as an army of occupation forty-three years ago! Most people in this country weren't even born
when the decision was made to send our troops to Europe. They are doing nothing there but sitting
around, drinking beer, getting fat, and chasing girls. The GAO has said that we don't have enough
bullets to fight even a thirty-day war in Europe. Yet it costs us $150 billion a year to keep those
guys there. I would submit to you that if we stop spending that $150 billion a year and bring those
troops home, the Europeans would defend themselves. And the kicker is: Do you know who they
would buy their guns from? They would buy their guns from us, because they don't have a very
good defense industry establishment.
But those are very unlikely actions. No politicians are even talking about those solutions.
I understand that. With the present cast of jerks in Washington, it is not going to happen. The
politicians are going to foul things up. They are not going to do what has to be done. They are
going to be more concerned about keeping their votes and winning the next election. That is going
144



==================================================
                     PAGE 145                     
==================================================

to continue until we are forced into solving our problems. Then it is going to be a disaster.
If the politicians don't act, do we eventually face a choice between very high inflation or a
deep recession?
It is going to be an extreme. What I suspect will happen—and I am just speculating, I don't have to
make this decision yet—is that somewhere along the line a recession will develop. Initially, the
politicians will say, "We've got to bite the bullet and suffer through this. This is good for us; it will
help clean out our system." People are going to buy that for a while. Then it is going to start to hurt.
Then it is really going to start to hurt. At that point, the politicians are going to give up, and they
are going to start to inflate their way out of it. But the only way to inflate your way out at that point
is to really print money!
In that scenario, we start off with a recession and end up with very high inflation.
Right, but we could have wild inflation first and then deflation. Another very real possibility is that
we will eventually have exchange controls. Fortunately, I don't have to make my investment
decisions for two or three years forward right now.
What kind of exchange controls?
By exchange controls I mean limitations on capital flows. If you want to go to Europe, you can't
take more than $1,000. You can't ship money out of the country without the government's approval.
What happens to the relative values of currencies in a situation like that?
The dollar disappears. What would bring on exchange controls is the dollar getting weaker and
weaker. The politicians would then try to bring in Draconian exchange controls, which would just
make the situation worse.
When you say disappear, are you talking about the dollar becoming like the Argentine peso?
Why not? Why couldn't it happen? Remember the Civil War expression, "I don't give a damn about
a greenback dollar."
You talk about the collapse of the dollar as if it's an inevitability.
In 1983, we were the largest creditor nation in the world. In 1985, we became a debtor nation for
the first time since 1914. By the end of 1987, our foreign debts were greater than all of the foreign
debts of every nation south of the Rio Grande put together: Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, and all
the rest.
Can I paraphrase the chain of events you imply as follows: Nothing meaningful will be done
to change the budget deficit situation. The continued budget deficit will guarantee that the
trade deficit situation stays bad or even gets worse. That, in turn, guarantees that sooner or
later, the dollar will come under extreme pressure.
Absolutely. That's why I'm not long the dollar.
How does the bond market fit into this scenario?
At some point, foreigners are going to stop putting money into this country because of the
weakening dollar. That means the American public will have to finance the debt. We have only a 3
to 4 percent savings rate. To get the American public to finance that debt, interest rates would have
to be very high. If the Federal Reserve tries to avoid high rates by printing more money, then the
dollar just disappears and the Fed loses control completely. That is the case where you get
hyperinflation and 25 to 30 percent interest rates. Either way, we are going to have high rates. You
might start out with lower rates first if the politicians decide to bite the bullet by having a recession.
But then, they will eventually give up and start printing money.
But, sooner or later, the bond market collapses.
Absolutely. Sooner or later, we repeat the English experience of not having a long-term bond
market. But I don't know when sooner or later is. It could be three years; it could be ten.
How far did British bonds fall in the situation you are referring to?
About 70 percent.
What kind of things do you look at in deciding which scenario will happen first: deflation or
145



==================================================
                     PAGE 146                     
==================================================

inflation?
Money supply, government deficits, trade deficits, inflation figures, the financial markets, and
government policy. I look at all those things for the U.S. and key foreign countries as well. It is one
big, three-dimensional puzzle. However, if you had a three-dimensional puzzle, you could
eventually put it together. But this puzzle is not one in which you can spread out the pieces on a
great big table and put them all together. The picture is always changing. Every day some pieces
get taken away and others get thrown in.
While we are on the topic of scenarios, do you have a long-term outlook for gold?
In 1934, they set the price of gold at $35 an ounce and gold production declined every year
between 1935 and 1980. Production kept going down because there was no incentive to look for
gold. During that whole forty-five-year period, the consumption of gold kept going up, especially
during the 1960s and 1970s, when we had the electronic revolution. Demand got bigger and bigger,
while at the same time, the supply was going down. You would have had a great bull market in
gold in the 1970s, no matter what. Even if inflation was at zero percent, you still would have had a
big bull market in gold during the 1970s, because of supply and demand.
The situation has changed entirely in the 1980s. There is nothing like taking the price of gold from
$35 to $875 to make people go into the gold business. Gold production has gone up every year
since 1980. Just based on known projections for mine openings and expansions, gold production is
scheduled to go up every year until at least 1995. At the same time, there have been major
technological advances in the recovery processes for gold. In short, there is much more gold
available than there used to be, and that trend will continue at least into the mid-1990s.
I own some gold as an insurance policy, but I don't think gold is going to be the great inflation
hedge of the 1990s that it was in the 1970s, because supply and demand is so different. I don't
know what the inflation hedge of the 1990s will be yet, but fortunately, I don't have to decide
today.
The supply/demand picture you are painting for gold is obviously negative. But if you put
that together with a situation in which, using your own words, "the dollar disappears,"
wouldn't such an event swamp the internal supply/demand balance of gold?
Certainly, gold may keep its purchasing power. It may do better, it may do worse, but it's not going
to be the best market.
In other words, gold was yesterday's inflation hedge.
Generals always fight the last war. Portfolio managers always invest in the last bull market. The
idea that gold has always been the great store of value is absurd. There have been many times in
history when gold has lost purchasing power—sometimes for decades.
I should add something else about gold. Remember that three-dimensional puzzle I was talking
about, where there are always pieces being removed and added. Don't forget South Africa in that
puzzle. Gold is more complicated because of the South African situation. I fully expect South
Africa to eventually blow up, because I think that the government has painted itself too far into a
corner. If there were a revolution tomorrow and the blacks took over, the South African whites
would dump all their gold. So the price would actually go down a lot.
In a situation like that, I would think the price of gold would go up sharply, because of the
panic related to disruptions in mine production.
While the revolution is going on, the price will go up, but after that, it will go down. The move
down will completely confuse everybody. They will ask, "Why is the price of gold moving down?"
But you will want to buy after that move down, because the euphoria of the revolution will also
bring chaos.
We have talked about your long-term views for the stock market, bonds, currencies, and gold.
Any thoughts about oil?
Yes, when the recession hits—and I guarantee it will some day—the price of oil is going to go way
down. You can put that in writing; I don't mind saying that. It certainly is going to go under $12.
Whether that is $11 or $7 or $3,1 don't know. [The price of oil was approximately $16 at the time
of this interview.]

==================================================

Given the general scenario you are talking about—the stock market going down, the dollar
going down, etc.—is there anything that the average guy can do to protect himself?
Buy European and Far Eastern currencies; buy Treasury bills; buy farm land.
How did you first get interested in trading?
Investing. I stumbled onto Wall Street. In 1964,1 had just finished college and was going on to
graduate school. I got a summer job through a guy I met, who happened to work for a Wall Street
firm. I didn't know anything about Wall Street at the time. I didn't know the difference between
stocks and bonds. I didn't even know that there was a difference between stocks and bonds. All I
knew about Wall Street was that it was somewhere in New York and something unpleasant had
happened there in 1929.
After that summer, I went to Oxford during 1964-1966. Whereas all the Americans I knew at
Oxford were interested in politics, I was more interested in reading the Financial Times.
Were you trading while you were at Oxford?
Very lightly. I was an odd letter. The money I was investing in the market was my scholarship
money at Oxford. I would get my scholarship money at the beginning of the year and invest as long
as I could.
Not exactly deep pockets.
[He laughs] If I had lost much money in either of those two years
So you actually started making money right off the bat?
Yes, I was making money. That was the bull market of 1964-1965. By the time I left Oxford in the
summer of 1966, the bear market had started, but I had already paid off my bills. I was lucky. If I
had gone to Oxford during 1965-1967,1 probably would have gotten wiped out.
What happened after Oxford?
I was in the army for a couple of years, and since I didn't have any money, I couldn't follow the
market. In 1968, the day I got out of the army, I went to work on Wall Street. I invested everything
I could. My first wife used to say, "We need a TV." I said, "What do we need a TV for? Let's put
the money in the market, and we could have ten TVs." She said, "We need a sofa." I said, "We
could have ten sofas if we just put the money in the market for a little while."
What kind of job did you get on Wall Street?
Junior analyst.
Covering what stocks?
Machine tools and then advertising agencies.
Were you investing in the stocks you were covering?
I invested in anything.
Successfully?
I came into the market on August 1,1968, right at the top. But I still had some money left, and in
January 1970,1 figured out it was going to be a bear market. I don't know how I figured it out. As I
mentioned earlier, I took all the money I had and bought puts. By May, I had tripled my money. In
July, I started shorting stocks, and by September, I was wiped out. Those first two years were great:
I went from being a genius to a fool.
So you were back to ground zero in September 1970. What happened then?
I saved everything I had and put it back into the market. I didn't care about a TV or a sofa. The wife
got rid of me. I was the entrepreneurial spirit personified. Just like those guys who build up great
retail chains, and plow everything back into their stores, I was plowing everything back into the
market.
Were you trading just stocks at this time?
Bonds, stocks, currencies, commodities.
When did you get involved in these different markets?
I traded all of them almost from the very beginning. Bonds and stocks from day one. Currencies
147



==================================================
                     PAGE 148                     
==================================================

fairly early too. When I was at Oxford, I kept as much money in dollars as I could, because I knew
they were going to devalue sterling any day. I knew it was coming, and it did—a year after I left.
Once again, I was a little early. Even then, I had a strong awareness of currencies.
In the late 1960s, I also got involved in commodities by buying gold. In my early years in the
business, I remember interviewing for a job. The fellow asked me, "What do you read in the Wall
Street Journal' I said, "One of the first things I read is the commodity page." The guy was stunned,
because he did too. This was back before commodities were commodities. He offered me a job, and
when I turned him down, he almost strangled me. This job interview was in 1970, and I was al-
ready trading commodities.
Going from ground zero in September 1970, where did you start picking up tradingwise to
build up to your ultimate trading success?
My early losses taught me a lot. Since then—I don't like to say this kind of thing—I have made
very few mistakes. I learned quickly not to do anything unless you know what you are doing. I
learned that it is better to do nothing and wait until you get a concept so right, and a price so right,
that even if you are wrong, it is not going to hurt you.
Did you have a losing year after that point?
No.
How did the Quantum Fund get started?
George Soros was the senior partner, and I was the junior partner. We started off with one senior
partner, one junior partner, and one secretary.
How did you know George Soros?
In 1970, I went to work for him at Amhold and S. Bleichroeder. We left in 1973 because new
brokerage firm regulations did not allow you to get a percentage of the trading profits. We could
have stayed, but we couldn’t' t have managed money. So we had to leave—fortunately. We left and
started our own firm.
What kind of trading did you do for the Quantum Fund? As I understand it, that fund was
managed differently from the typical fund.
We invested in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, everything— long and short—all over the
world.
Did you and George make independent trading decisions?
No. If you broke down the division of labor, he was the trader and I was the analyst.
Did you come up with the idea, for example, shorting the dollar, and did he decide the timing
of when to do it?
Yes, sort of.
What if you disagreed on a market? Usually if we disagreed, we just did nothing. So, you both
had to agree on a trade to do it?
There were no rules. Sometimes we would disagree and do the trade anyway, because one of us felt
more strongly. But that type of scenario rarely came up, since we were usually in agreement, and
once we worked things through, it was pretty clear that the trade was either right or wrong. When
we thought something through, a consensus was formed. I hate to use that word, because consensus
investing is a disaster, but we almost always seemed to come together.
When you were trading leveraged products such as commodities and currencies, how did you
determine what your allocation was?
Until we ran out of money, we were always leveraged to the hilt. When we bought something and
ran out of money, we would look at the portfolio and push out whatever appeared to be the least
attractive item at that point. For example, if you wanted to buy corn and ran out of money, you
either had to stop buying corn or sell something else. It was an amoebic process. You know how
amoebas grow—they grow out this way, then they run into pressure so they grow out the other
way. It was a very amoebic portfolio.

==================================================
                     PAGE 149                     
==================================================

You never evaluated the risk of your positions on an individual basis? So, if you lost money in
one market and had to reduce your portfolio, you might just as easily cut back in another
market?
Right. We would always cut back on what we thought were the least attractive positions in the
portfolio.
Even today, that sounds like a very unconventional fund. Back then, I imagine it was
probably unique in terms of its investment strategy.
It certainly was unique. I still don't know anybody who trades all the markets. By all the markets, I
mean all the currencies, commodities, bonds, and stocks—long and short—alloverthe world. I am
retired now, and I still do all these markets. People say to me, "You're retired? We have a full staff
and can't even keep up with all these markets. What do you mean you are retired? You are short
stocks all over the world!"
I must admit, I find it amusing when you say you are retired.
Now in my retirement, I'm more active than anybody, and people say, "How do you follow all these
things?"
I have the same question.
I don't see how you can invest in American steel without understanding what is going on in
Malaysian palm oil. As I explained before, it is all part of a big, three-dimensional puzzle that is
always changing.
How do you find enough time to spend on all those markets? Just the reading itself seems to
be a monumental chore.
I do not do it nearly as actively as I used to. Over the years, I have spent a great deal of time
pouring a lot of stuff into my head. I have developed a great deal of perspective on many markets.
When I teach, students are always astonished by the range of historical markets that I am familiar
with. I know about these markets because I have pored over many commodity, bond, and stock
books so many times, for so many years. As an example, I knew about the great bull market in
cotton in 1861, when cotton went from \ cent to $1.05.
How do you find out about a market like that?
I start by finding the anomalous years in a long-term historical chart. When I see a picture like the
1861 cotton market, I ask myself, "What caused that? Why did that happen?" Then I try to figure it
out. From that, you learn an enormous amount.
In fact, one of the courses I teach at Columbia, which the kids call "Bulls and Bears," requires each
student to find a major historical market move. It doesn't matter which market, or whether the move
was up or down. My instructions are for them to tell me what one could have known at the time to
see the big move coming. When rubber was at 2 cents everyone said, "How can rubber ever go
up?" Yet it went up twelvefold. Somebody saw it. I always ask them, "What could you have seen at
the time?" I always nail them. They will say, "I knew the market would go up because there was
going to be a war." But I will make them tell me how they could have known at the time that there
was a war coming. The course gives them historical perspective across a broad spectrum of markets
and teaches them how to analyze.
I have lived through or studied hundreds, possibly even thousands, of bull and bear markets. In
every bull market, whether it is IBM or oats, the bulls always seem to come up with reasons why it
must go on, and on, and on. I remember hearing hundreds of times, "We are going to run out of
supply." "This time is going to be different." "Oil has to sell at $100 a barrel." "Oil is not a
commodity [he laughs]." "Gold is different from every other commodity." Well, damn, for 5,000
years it has not been different from every other commodity. There have been some periods when
gold has been very bullish, and other periods when it has gone down for many years. There is
nothing mystical about it. Sure, it has been a store of value, but so has wheat, corn, copper—
everything. All these things have been around for thousands of years. Some are more valuable than
others, but they are all commodities. They always have been, and they always will be.
I guess the 1987 stock market is a prime recent example of the "this time is going to be
149



==================================================
                     PAGE 150                     
==================================================

different" complacency.
Right. There was going to be a shortage of stocks again. In 1968, one of the major Wall Street
houses published a great learned thesis on why there was a shortage of stocks developing, and why
the bull market had to keep going up for years—right at the top. In 1987, you started hearing it all
over again: "There is a shortage of stocks, because everybody is buying in all this stock." At the
bottom of the bear market [he begins a laugh that builds steadily] there is going to be a shortage of
money— I assure you—with a gigantic surplus of stocks.
While editing this chapter, I came across the following item in a Time magazine story about the
incredible bull market on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (August 8, 1988, p. 29). One could hardly ask
for a better current example of "this time is going to be different." The subject of the Japanese stock
market actually comes up slightly later in this interview.
The explosive growth worries some Western financial experts, who fear that the boom could go
bust. If that happened, investors with heavy losses in Tokyo could be forced to pull money out of
other markets, triggering another crash. Japanese stocks are already trading at astronomical prices
in comparison with the profits of the companies that issued the shares, at least by American
standards. On the New York Stock Exchange, such price-earnings ratios run about 15 to 1, while in
Tokyo the multiples are often four times as high. Nippon Telegraph & Telephone trades at 158
times its earnings. "Japanese authorities have allowed a speculative bubble to grow," warns George
Soros, manager of the New York City-based Quantum Fund, "At no time in the past has a bubble of
this magnitude been deflated in an orderly manner."
Such worries are groundless, argue analysts in Tokyo. The Japanese attribute the high price-
earnings ratios in part to accounting rules that allow companies to understate earnings to keep their
taxes lower. Another factor propping up prices is so-called cross-holding of stock. Because many
Japanese companies hold large blocks of other companies' stock, which out of tradition are seldom
traded, fewer shares are available for purchase so their prices rise.
Is there a lot of similarity between different cases of market hysteria?
It's always the same cycle. When a market is very low, there comes a time when some peope buy it
because it has become undervalued. The market starts to go up and more people buy because it is a
fundamentally sound thing to do or because the charts look good. In the next stage, people buy
because it has been the thing to do. My mother calls me up and says, "Buy me XYZ stock." I ask
her, "Why?" "Because the stock has tripled," she answers. Finally, there comes the magical stage:
People are hysterical to buy, because they know that the market is going to go up forever, and
prices exceed any kind of rational, logical economic value.
The whole process then repeats itself on the downside. The market gets tremendously overpriced
and it starts to go down. More people sell because the fundamentals are turning poor. As the
economics deteriorate, more and more people sell. Next, people sell just because it has been the
thing to do. Everybody knows it is going to go to nothing, so they sell. Then the market reaches the
hysteria stage and gets very underpriced. That's when you can buy it for a pop. But for a long-term
investment, you usually have to wait a few years and let the market base.
Talking about extreme bull markets, I recently read that Australia sold a l\ acre plot in Tokyo
for $450 million that they bought for $250,000 twenty-five years ago. Is Japan the tulipmania
of our day? [During 1634-1636, a speculative frenzy in tulips swept Holland, causing such an
enormous rise and collapse in tulip bulb prices that the event is still famous today.]
I guarantee that the Japanese stock market is going to have a major collapse—possibly within the
next year or two. Many of our stocks are going to go down 80 to 90 percent in the bear market. A
lot more of theirs are going to go down 80 to 90 percent.
Is there any way the average U.S. trader can take advantage of that?
Short Japanese stocks, short Japanese indexes, short Japanese calls, buy Japanese puts. A lot of
Japanese stocks trade here and you can just short them. You can short the Japanese index, which
trades in Singapore and Osaka. Most American brokers can do it for you. There are at least five
major Japanese corporations which have options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
Although I think a collapse is coming, you have to be very careful about going short Japan, because
they might change the rales on you at any time.

                     PAGE 151                     
==================================================

I don't know if you remember the Kuwaiti stock market of 1980-1981. In that market, you could
buy stocks with a postdated check. You could buy $ 10 million worth of stocks with a postdated
check; you could buy $100 million worth of stock that way. It didn't matter. Everybody was doing
it. In the end, there was a passport clerk who owned $10 billion worth of stocks! All of it on
postdated checks.
Although that market was a very clear example of hysteria, I didn't short it. I thought about it that
long [he snaps fingers]. The reason I didn't go short was because I knew when the market caved in,
they would create rales so that I would never get my money out. Of course, the market eventually
collapsed. If I had gone short they would have blamed it on me and said I caused the damn thing by
shorting. People were even blaming me for the October crash last year, because I said it was going
to happen. Some people claim I caused oil prices to collapse, because I said the price of oil was
going to go down. I wish I were that influential or powerful.
To get back to Japan, I have a few Japanese shorts, and I'm going to have more. But whatever I do
in Japan, I know when the crisis comes, I don't want to be around near the bottom, because the
Japanese are going to protect themselves. And whatever they do to protect themselves, it ain't going
to be good for Jim Rogers. I guarantee that.
You may not be able to get your money out?
Yes, they could freeze the currency. They could have three different tiers of currency. God knows
what they will do.
Wouldn't you be protected if you were short a Japanese market that traded on an American
exchange like the СВОЕ?
Suppose they create two levels of currencies and the guy on the other side of the trade can't meet
his obligation.
The clearinghouse is responsible.
OK, fine, I'm happy to hear it. That's the best news I've had in a long time. Still, whatever I do, I'm
going to be careful. If the Japanese stock market goes from 30,000 to 24,000 or 20,000 that's fine.
But you better think about getting out of it before the last bit if it goes to 12,000. If you wait that
long, you may get your profits out, but it is going to be very painful.
Why did you leave the Quantum Fund?
I didn't want to do the same thing for the rest of my life. I always wanted to have more than one
career. When I came to New York in 1968,1 was a poor boy from Alabama. By 1979,1 had made
more money than I knew existed in the world. Also, we were getting very big. We had started with
three people, and by 1979, we had fifteen people. They wanted to know when they could go on
vacation, get raises, etc. I wasn't interested in any of that; I was interested in investing. I didn't want
to get bigger.
In September 1979,1 decided it would be my last year. But then, in October, there was a big
collapse in the stock market, which we sailed right through. It was so much fun that I decided to
stay on one more year. I left in 1980.
Was 1980 the start of your "retirement"?
Yes, in 1980,1 just cashed in my chips and retired.
Is that the point you became an independent trader?
The term I really prefer is "unemployed."
Well, you teach at Columbia.
That's unemployed. I did it as a part-time thing starting in 1983 so that I could play squash.
I thought it was the love of teaching.
It has developed into much more. But when I started out, I didn't even want to teach. I just wanted
to learn how to play squash.
You're not being facetious? You actually started teaching so you could play squash?
I'm dead serious. Columbia is right here and the Dean kept pestering me to teach a course. I told
him, "I don't think people should go to business school." I thought that, for many people, business
151



==================================================
                     PAGE 152                     
==================================================

school was a waste of time. I still think so. But one thing I wanted to learn in my retirement was
how to play squash. So I made a deal with the Dean to teach one course per semester for free, in
return for lifetime access to the Columbia gym. He agreed. I thought I got a great deal, but he was
smarter than I was—I'm still teaching.
I take it, at this point, you really enjoy it.
Oh, it's good fun, yes. And Columbia is terrific.
What courses are you teaching?
Security analysis, investment analysis, and the "Bulls and Bears" course we talked about before.
Of the multitude of your trading experiences, do any stand out as particularly dramatic?
Lots. My October 19 birthday present that I talked about earlier was probably the best. August 1982
is another. I put a gigantic part of my net worth into bonds throughout 1981 and 1982, and in
August 1982, they skyrocketed.
Any negative dramatic experiences?
August 1971 was a very exciting time. We were long Japan and short America, and one Sunday
night, Nixon announced that he was taking America off the gold standard. I didn't even know it had
happened. I had been off somewhere on my motorcycle, and I came in Monday morning without
having read the papers. That week the Japanese stock market went down 20 percent, and the U.S.
stock market went up. We were losing heavily on both sides.
Did you have to liquidate your positions right off the bat?
You can't liquidate at a time like that. Who can you sell to in Japan? Who could you buy from in
the U.S.? If you covered your shorts, you made things worse. In a situation like that, you have to
figure out whether you are right or wrong. If there was going to be a major fundamental change
forever, the first loss is the best loss. But if fundamentally you are basically correct, then you do
nothing but sit there and let the market hysteria wash around you.
Did you stay with your positions?
Yes.
So, you really had to ride out a rather treacherous paper loss.
There is no such thing as a paper loss. A paper loss is a very real loss.
What was the analysis that gave you the confidence to stay with your positions?
Our analysis was that this was not the end of the world. America had simply taken a short-term
step, and it was not going to solve our country's long-term problems.
Did that position actually turn out to be OK?
It turned out fine. The Nixon announcement was just another step in the dissolution of the Bretton
Woods Agreement [a 1944 international pact that, among other things, established guidelines for
foreign exchange rate stabilization] and the decline of America. America was rallying in its own
bear market.
So, you saw it as a cosmetic move that wasn't going to change the trend, and you stayed with
your position.
Right.
Is that a general principle: When government measures are implemented to counteract a
trend, you should sell the rally after the government action?
Absolutely. It should be written down as an axiom that you always invest against the central banks.
When the central banks try to prop up a currency, go the other way.
What is the biggest public fallacy regarding market behavior?
That the market is always right. The market is nearly always wrong. I can assure you of that.
What else?
Never, ever, follow conventional wisdom in the market. You have to learn to go counter to the
markets. You have to learn how to think for yourself; to be able to see that the emperor has no
152



==================================================
                     PAGE 153                     
==================================================

clothes. Most people can't do it. Most people want to follow a trend. "The trend is your friend."
Maybe that is valid for a few minutes in Chicago, but for the most part, following what everyone
else is doing is rarely a way to get rich. You may make money that way for a while, but keeping it
is very hard.
But actually, your whole style of trading involves staying with a trend for years. So isn't what
you are saying contradictory?
That kind of trend—a trend that is economically justified—is different. You have to see the
supply/demand balance change early, buy early, and only buy markets that are going to go on for
years. By "trend following," I meant buying a market just because it goes up and selling it just be-
cause it goes down.
What trading rules do you live by?
Look for hysteria to see if you shouldn't go the opposite way, but don't go the opposite way until
you have fully examined the situation. Also, remember that the world is always changing. Be aware
of change. Buy change. You should be willing to buy or sell anything. So many people say, "I
could never buy that kind of stock," "I could never buy utilities," "I could never play commodities."
You should be flexible and alert to investing in anything.
If you were counseling the average investor, what would you tell him?
Don't do anything until you know what you are doing. If you make 50 percent two years in a row
and then lose 50 percent in the third year, you would actually be worse off than if you just put your
money in a money market fund. Wait for something to come along that you know is right. Then
take your profit, put it back in the money market fund, and just wait again. You will come out way
ahead of everybody else.
Are you ever wrong on a major position play? That is, are one of your almost sure shots ever
wrong, or are they so well selected that they just invariably go?
I don't want to make it sound like I don't know how to lose money—because I know how to lose
money better than most people—but there has not been a major mistake in a long time. But you
have to remember that I don't trade that often. It is not as though I'm making three decisions a
month. I may make three decisions a year, or five decisions a year, and I'll stay with them.
How often do you make a trade?
Well, there is a difference between making a trade and deciding to buy bonds in 1981. I've owned
bonds since 1981, but I sell around the position. I make trades, but basically I own them. I went
short the dollar at the end of 1984. Now, I have made a fair amount of trades in currencies since the
end of 1984, but it is basically one trade with a lot of trades around it.
Very few investors or traders are as successful as you have been over time. What makes you
different?
I don't play. I just don't play.
I can understand that. But still, very few people can analyze the same fundamentals you are
looking at and so consistently be correct in assessing all the variables.
Just don't do anything until you know you've got it right. As an example, until you see American
agriculture hit a low, then no matter what happens in the world—unless the world is going to stop
eating—you can't go wrong. American agriculture is now so competitive, and so many marginal
farmers have been washed out, that it has to go up. You just watch American agriculture
deteriorate, deteriorate, deteriorate, and then you buy. You may buy early or late. In my case,
usually a little bit early. But, so what? The worst that happens is you bought it too early. Who
cares?
Is there anything else besides the fact that you are very selective that sets you apart?
I have no boundaries. I am totally flexible. I am open to everything, and I pursue everything. I have
no more compunction about speculating in Singapore dollars or shorting Malaysian palm oil than I
do about buying General Motors.
What happens when you have one scenario for currencies, one for the stock market, one for

==================================================

the bond market, and not everything meshes?
Then I won't do anything. It happens all the time. I don't do anything until all the pieces fit.
What is your opinion about chart reading?
I haven't met a rich technician. Excluding, of course, technicians who sell their technical services
and make a lot of money.
Do you use charts yourself?
Yes, I look at them every week. I use them for knowledge, to see what is going on. I learn a lot
about what is going on in the world by looking at charts.
But you don't ever look at charts and say, "I've seen this type of pattern before and it usually
means the market is topping."
I look at charts to see what has happened.
Not what will happen?
What has happened. If you don't know what has happened, you'll never know what is going to
happen. The charts say to me that there is a runaway bull market. They give me facts, but that's it. I
don't say—what is that term you used earlier, reversal?—there is a reversal here. I don't even know
what a reversal is.
A reversal simply is—
Don't tell me. It might mess up my mind. I don't know about those things, and I don't want to know.
Do the markets behave any differently now because so much money is being managed by
trend-oriented systems?
No. They may not always have been on a computer, but there always have been systems. I
guarantee that you can go back 100 years in the market and not find a single decade where there
hasn't been some kind of system, some kind of new formula developed to play the markets.
So the markets today are basically the same as the markets in the 1970s, 1960s, and 1950s.
The same as the markets in the nineteenth century. The same things make markets go up and down.
They have not changed the rules of supply and demand.
Do you have any goals at this point?
I'm looking for adventure. I'd like to be able to wean myself more and more from the markets.
There are two problems. First, investing is such a wonderful pastime that it is hard to give up. I
haven't changed from when I was twenty-two years old. I always wanted to read and know
everything that was going on and figure out the future. The second problem is what do I do with my
funds if I just stop? If I turn it over to my friendly broker at XYZ, I would be broke in five years,
and then I would have to go back to work.
Any last words?
Good investing is really just common sense. But it is astonishing how few people have common
sense—how many people can look at the exact same scenario, the exact same facts and not see
what is going to happen. Ninety percent of them will focus on the same thing, but the good inves-
tor—or trader, to use your term—will see something else. The ability to get away from
conventional wisdom is not very common.
Jim Rogers' unique approach may be difficult to emulate in its entirety, but many of his trading
principles are of great relevance to all traders. His basic concepts are:
1. Buy value. If you buy value, you will not lose much even if your timing is wrong.
2. Wait for a catalyst. Bottoming markets can go nowhere for very long periods of time. To avoid
tying up your money in a dead market, wait until there is a catalyst to change the market direction.
3. Sell hysteria. This principle is sound, but its application is far from easy. Rogers' methodology
can be paraphrased as follows: Wait for hysteria, examine to see whether the market is wrong, go
against the hysteria if fundamentally validated, be sure you are right, and then hold on tight. The
tricky parts are the last two steps. Very few traders have Rogers' analytical skills and intuitive
insights to wade through the maze of facts and statistics in the "three-dimensional puzzle" of world
154

==================================================

markets and arrive at the correct long-term projections with uncanny high ac
curacy. Without this type of accuracy, the ability to sit tight could be a lethal virtue. And, even if
you can predict long-term economic trends with a sufficient degree of accuracy, there still remains
the problem of being able to sit tight, particularly when the financial steamroller of market hysteria
is running counter to your position.
For example, I doubt many traders would have been able to sell gold at $675, stay short while it
surged to $875 in only four days, and then hold the position through the subsequent long-term
collapse, eventually liquidating at a large profit. Even if you have the steel nerves necessary to
duplicate this feat, you probably lack the financial resources to outstay this type of market or the
same high degree of accuracy in picking your shots. Perhaps this particular concept should come
with a caution label attached: Warning! Any attempts by the unskilled practitioner to apply the
method described herein can lead to financial ruin.
4. Be very selective. Wait for the right trade to come along. Never trade for trading's sake. Have the
patience to sit on your money until the high probability trade sets up exactly right.
5. Be flexible. Biases against certain markets or types of trades limit your field of opportunity. A
trader who says, "I will never go short," has a distinct disadvantage compared to the trader who is
willing to go short as well as long. The trader who is open to examining a broad range of markets
has a distinct advantage over someone who is willing to participate in only one market.
6. Never follow conventional wisdom. Keep this principle in mind and you will be less likely to buy
stocks after the Dow has already moved from 1,000 to 2,600 and everyone is convinced that there
is a shortage of stocks.
7. Know when to hold and when to liquidate a losing position. If you believe the market is going
against you because your original analysis was flawed (such as when you realize you overlooked an
important fundamental factor), then as Rogers states: "The first loss is the best loss." However, if
the market is going against you, but you are convinced your original analysis was right, then sit out
the hysteria. As a cautionary word, this latter condition should be applied only by traders who fully
understand the risks involved.

Mark Weinstein-High-Percentage Trader
After a brief period as a real estate broker, Mark Weinstein became a full-time trader. His start in
trading was so naive that he virtually threw his money away. After that early failure, Weinstein
withdrew to seriously study the markets and earn another trading stake. With the exception of one
disastrous trading experience, Weinstein was a successful trader from that point on. He has
intensively traded a wide variety of markets, including stocks, stock options, stock index futures,
currencies, and commodities. Although he is reluctant to divulge specific details, it is clear that he
has profited handsomely in all these trading arenas.
I met Mark Weinstein through a mutual friend. Although he was very intrigued by the project, his
desire for anonymity made him reluctant to tell his story. He would call me and say, "OK, I will do
it, let's schedule the interview." Then the next day he would call and say, "I changed my mind. I
don't want the publicity." This pattern was repeated several times, with each decision accompanied
by lengthy phone conversations regarding the merits and drawbacks of doing the interview. Finally,
in exasperation, I said, "Mark, we could have done three interviews in the time we have spent
talking about it." That was our last conversation regarding the matter until about two months later
when, impressed by the caliber of traders who had agreed to participate in this book, Weinstein
decided to do the interview.
Weinstein met me at my office one summer evening. Because the building turns off the air-
conditioning after 5:00 P.M., we were forced out into a corner lobby, which, although warm, was at
least less stifling. The interview was conducted over a dinner of deli sandwiches and soda. Through
our phone conversations, I knew Weinstein had a strong tendency to go off in many directions in
any conversation—that's how his mind works, one topic leads him to think of five others and their
various interrelations. Dreading a mammoth editing task, I stressed to Weinstein the need for
remaining focused on the specific questions. I could tell that Weinstein was making an extra effort
to heed this advice. This fact notwithstanding, the interview lasted five hours and yielded a 200-
page transcript.
How did you first get involved in trading?
Back in 1972, when I was a real estate broker, I had a friend who was a commodity broker. He and
I had gone to school together.
Did your friend get you interested in the markets?
It didn't take much to get me interested because my father's hobby was gambling. He was very
good at percentages, and I used to watch him at the crap tables. In a sense, I think being a trader is
in my genes. Also, trading fascinated me because of my mathematics and science background in
college and because I had a commodity broker friend who was into computer strategies.
Do you remember your first trade?
I remember it exactly. I opened up a commodity account with $8,400, and I went long corn based
on a recommendation made by the firm's grain analyst. Three days later, I was out $7,800.
Did your broker friend advise you to follow the analyst's recommendation?
Yes, and he also followed it. What I didn't realize then was that the market had been rising for some
time and was already overbought when I went long. It wasn't even a bad reaction. I just got in on
the move too late. I didn't have enough margin to keep the position going. Also, my guts turned on
me, and I didn't want to put up any more money.
It sounds to me like your friend let you put on a position that was clearly out of line with any
money management principles.
It was one of those get-rich-quick schemes.
Did you know anything about the markets at the time?
Absolutely nothing. If I flipped through a chart book, it looked like a collection of TV test patterns
to me.
Did you have any idea of the risk involved?
I knew that the chances of my winning were very slim because I didn't know what I was doing.
156



==================================================
                     PAGE 157                     
==================================================

Didn't it occur to you that you should learn something before you started?
No, because I was desperate for a change; I didn't like being a real estate broker.
Was the money that you invested a substantial part of your savings at the time?
It was all the money I had.
When did you get enough money to come back into the markets?
It took me approximately six or seven months. I worked seven days a week and rented as many
apartments as I could get my hands on. I also sold a few co-ops. By that time, I had saved up about
$24,000.1 took out $4,000 to live on, and used the remaining $20,000 to open an account.
Did you make any effort to learn anything about the markets in the interim?
Yes. I studied the gold market, learned how to chart, and became familiar with the concept of
overbought and oversold markets. I figured that if I bought a severely oversold market and left
myself enough money for two margin calls, I couldn't lose unless something drastic happened in
the economy. That was my method.
But if you use that approach in a trending market, you are going to get killed.
It worked in that market. I guess ignorance was bliss.
What were your trading results the second time around?
I did well for several years after that and managed to build a small fortune. But a lot of that was due
to luck.
It couldn't have all been luck. What were you doing right when you were making money?
In relation to what I know now, there was very little that I was doing right. I think I just had good
markets. In those days, commodities seemed to follow chart patterns a lot better than they do now.
Very few people knew anything about technical analysis then, so the markets were much more
orderly. I got a break by learning as much as I could about technical analysis at a time when it was
working pretty well.
Did you have a method for controlling risk?
No, and I still don't. I depended on my nervous system and gut reaction. I covered positions when I
did not feel right about them. Sometimes it would be after two days; sometimes after two hours.
Were you spending all day trading?
All day and all night. I was losing friends left and right. I sat in a studio apartment with charts
plastered on every wall. I probably looked like a madman to the friends I had left.
So this was really a full-time endeavor.
Not only an endeavor—it was an obsession! I slept with it; I dreamt about it. Sometimes I would
stay up all night thinking about what I would do the next day. If I didn't need sleep, I would have
done it twenty-four hours a day. At that point, it wasn't the money that was motivating me. I was
hooked on the game: on the challenge of trying to figure out the market.
Did you sometimes wake up with a feeling that you knew the gold market was going higher or
anything like that?
No, it had nothing to do with the direction of the market. It was just an extension of what I was
doing during the day. I would take so much of it to sleep that I ended up exploring unconsciously
what I had been doing consciously that day.
Did you have any goals when you set out?
Well, the great American dream is to make a million dollars, and that was particularly true in those
days. I never really had a materialistic dream until I started vacationing and traveling in Europe.
When was this? How many years after you started trading?
It was in the mid-1970s. I had been trading for about three or four years.
Had you passed the million dollar mark by that point?
Yes, and I had made enough money to be able to relax, start vacationing, and think about things I
wanted to buy. At that point, I was feeling confident enough to know that I could replace the money
157

                     PAGE 158                     
==================================================

I spent with my trading profits. I figured the next logical step was to start appreciating the money I
was making. I saw a castle in the south of France that I wanted. I was particularly impressed that
the castle had a moat around it, and the idea of living there appealed to me. It was on the market for
only $350,000, and I figured it would take about $50,000 a year to keep it up.
That doesn't sound like a lot of money for a castle.
Today it is probably worth $5 million. When I came back to the U.S., I wanted to make the money
to pay for the castle almost immediately. That was a tremendous mistake.
I don't understand. You already had the money to buy the castle; you didn't have to make it.
Even though I had the money, I still looked at it in terms of how much it cost. I know people in this
business who have $17 million in their trading account and won't buy a new car.
So you didn't take your money out of the account to buy the castle.
No, I came back and decided that making the money was going to be my goal.
In other words, your next $350,000 in profits was going to go for the castle.
Exactly.
What happened?
On my next trade, I put on a large long position in soybeans. The market closed up the first day,
and I had about a 25 percent profit on my money. I was planning to get out of the position at the
end of the week. The biggest mistake I made was having a specific target of what I wanted out of
the trade.
The target being determined not by market analysis, but rather by the $350,000 you wanted
to make on the trade. Did you trade differently because you were trying to make money for a
specific purpose?
Yes, I didn't consider the risk and took on too large a position. I was not using any type of rational
judgment. I was being guided by my material desires. The market went up again the next day, but
collapsed suddenly late in the session, locking limit-down.
Did you get stuck with your position at limit-down?
Yes, I couldn't get out. The next day I showed up at the brokerage office and the market opened
offered limit-down. I waited all day to see if it would come off of locked limit-down, but it didn't.
I take it that you would have liquidated your position if you could have.
If the market had traded, I would have sold out at any price.
Do you remember your emotions at the time?
I was in a state of shock and had no decision-making capability left whatsoever. I couldn't fall
asleep, and found myself almost praying the market would somehow trade the next day. On the
third day, I called the office about a half an hour before the opening, and they told me it didn't look
like there was any hope. I didn't even bother going in because I couldn't face the people in the
office. I was certain that they were getting a big thrill out of my situation.
Why is that?
There were a few other professional traders in the office who were never able to make the kind of
money I had been making. When this situation developed, they were almost relieved. It seemed to
justify all those years of their not taking positions like I did. They were really heartless. The only
person who was really upset was my broker, and, frankly, that was probably because he was afraid
of losing the account.
Did the other traders kid you about it?
They over consoled me and then laughed about it behind my back. They wanted to see me come in
and fall apart. That is why I stopped coming to the office.
Do you think they relished your predicament because it made them seem less deficient as
traders?
It went beyond that. I think there are a lot of people in this business who just enjoy watching others
lose money.
158



==================================================
                     PAGE 159                     
==================================================

Once you stopped going into the office, what did you do during the day?
I checked with other brokerage houses, trying to get price quotes.
Why didn't you just call your own broker? I was too embarrassed, and I didn't want to take
the derision. Your own broker was kidding you?
I didn't know what to think of him. I was starting to get paranoid and hostile because nothing could
be done. I went to a competing firm and spoke to their grains analyst. I was looking for someone to
hold my hand. He told me I would be OK, because the fundamentals were still strong and there
would be a tremendous demand for soybeans if the market went down another day. Of course, on
the fourth day, the market locked limit-down again.
How much were you losing each day?
About $ 125 thousand a day. This was at a time when the average annual salary was $15,000.1 was
not born rich, and I couldn't stop thinking of my loss in those terms.
Could you put that loss in perspective relative to your account size?
Before that trade, I had nearly $1.5 million in my trading account. So I was losing nearly 10 percent
of my equity level prior to the trade each day.
I was devastated. I felt like I was wounded in a trench and watching myself bleed to death. The
market went limit-down five days in a row, and I lost over $600,000. On the fifth day, I remember
sitting in a park holding hands with a girl I had picked up, literally crying on her lap. I was
practically in a psychotic state. I thought about getting out of the business altogether. I started to
think that what everybody was telling me was true—maybe it was just luck that I had made money
all those years. I worried that if I continued trading, I could wind up losing it all, and being forced
to go back to some job I didn't like.
Which was more devastating, the large monetary loss, or your feelings about going from
success to failure?
It was the money and the limit situation, and the fact that I couldn't act. My exact thoughts were:
Here I am, a person who thought it was un-American to go short, and what I found out was really
un-American was not being able to get out of a position.
So you felt cheated by not being able to get out?
I definitely felt cheated. To this day, I think there is something wrong with limit price moves.
Are you implying that price limits that were supposedly created to protect the public actually
work against them by preventing people from getting out of their losing positions?
Yes. I think the market should be totally free of restraints.
There is talk about putting limits on stock markets as a way of reducing volatility. Would that
actually be jumping from the frying pan into the fire?
Absolutely. Now, the average investor knows that if he wants to get out, he can at least get out at
some price. Imagine if this guy calls his broker and finds out that he can't even get out of the
market.
In other words, you are saying that those who are expounding the idea of limits are really
going to make matters worse for the small investor.
It is absolute lunacy. It is a law that is being proposed for the benefit of sophisticated institutional
investors.
Your earlier comment implied that, prior to the soybean trade, you always traded the long
side of the markets. Is that right?
Yes. I never went short. I felt it was un-American. After the soybean trade, I realized that the
business I was in was the height of capitalism, and it really made no difference what side of the
market you were on. All I could think about was that the people who were short made money and I
lost money.
How long did the emotional impact of this experience last?
Months. I didn't want to trade commodities anymore. I ripped every chart off my walls. I tore up
everything in my house that had anything to do with commodities.
159



==================================================
                     PAGE 160                     
==================================================

When did you begin trading again?
After a few months, I started trading AMEX stocks, but I found it amazingly slow. I missed the
leverage of the commodity markets. I didn't think I could successfully support myself trading
stocks.
Around that time, I ran into a friend who is a great options trader. I told him about my experiences
and he suggested that I join him. In my first week at his office he told me to buy Teledyne calls
right before expiration because he was sure they were going up. I followed his advice, and the calls
completely collapsed.
How much did you lose?
About $40,000.1 felt extremely hostile, but I didn't want to show it because he never promised me
any results. I was so upset that I walked out of the office and didn't come back for two days. He
tried reaching me during that time, but I didn't return his calls. Finally, he got a message to me
through a mutual friend.
Was he upset that he had given you bad advice?
When I came back to the office, he told me that he had done the exact opposite trade in another
account, and that the trade was mine. So I didn't really lose any money.
That sounds like an awfully odd type of practical joke.
It wasn't a practical joke. He was trying to teach me not to place blind trust in anyone—even him. It
was his way of teaching me the importance of self-reliance in being a good trader.
How did you do after that point?
I did pretty well. My friend was a phenomenal options trader. He knew everything about the market
and I learned a tremendous amount from him.
Did you trade options based on the methodologies he taught you?
Yes, combined with my own technical analysis.
Your friend didn't use technical analysis?
No, he didn't believe in it. He was a tape reader.
Has the fact that you have been extraordinarily successful as a 100 percent technical trader
changed his mind about technical analysis?
Not at all. He thinks technical analysis is just a crutch for me, and the real reason I make money is
experience. There was a point at which we separated for a few years. He came to my office one day
and watched me trade. He embraced me like a father and said, "You finally made it." I told him that
not only had I gained a lot of experience, but I had learned just about everything there was about
technical analysis, including certain things I had created myself. He said, "You never give up, do
you? It has nothing to do with technical analysis. You are trading that way because of experience."
Why did you and your option trading friend eventually separate?
There was a conflict in our trading styles. He was a great trader who was willing to take an
occasional large loss, because he knew he would more than make up for it with large gains and
come out way ahead in the long ran. However, I was uncomfortable trading that way. I preferred
trading for small profits and trying to eradicate losing trades. I wasn't willing to take the same type
of risk. Also, my approach was purely technical, whereas he was basically a tape reader. Anyway,
in 1980,1 decided to go off on my own. We got together again years later.
I know you once entered an options trading contest. Can you tell me about it?
It was originally organized by two traders on the СВОЕ floor. They got 47 traders together, each of
whom put up $5,000 in a winner-take-all contest. Each trader opened a $100,000 account with the
same clearing firm.
How long was the contest for?
Three months.
What were your results?
I turned the $100,000 into over $900,000 without any pyramiding [using profits to increase

==================================================

leverage].
That's a rather phenomenal performance.
Yes, but the markets were very good at that time.
What did you trade when you went out on your own in 1980?
I traded everything. I continued to trade stock options. When stock index futures trading began in
the early 1980s, that became a primary market for me. I also traded the commodity markets. In fact,
during the last two years, my trading has shifted to nearly 90 percent commodities.
Do you remember your first soybean trade after the debacle in the 1970s?
For a long time, I avoided soybeans. But, as I began to find myself trading the commodity markets
effortlessly, I knew deep down that I would eventually get back the money I lost in soybeans. I
never forgot about it.
It sounds like you were looking for revenge.
Yes, exactly. Every time I looked at a commodity chart book, my eyes would edge over to the
soybean chart, then I would quickly flip the page. I watched the market peripherally for years
before doing anything. When soybeans went down to $4.75,1 knew they were near a low, but I
didn't want to buy them until I was sure I couldn't lose on the trade. I was like a Sicilian whose wife
had been murdered ten years earlier, waiting for the perfect moment for revenge. When my
technical analysis convinced me that the market had bottomed for real, I jumped in on the long
side.
Where did you buy the beans?
Around $6.18. [This was shortly before the 1988 drought caused prices to skyrocket.]
Where did you get out?
I got out of some at $7.25, and the rest at $9.92. [The high of the move was $10.46.]
How much did you make on that trade?
Let's just say I made my money back in spades.
The way you talk about it, it sounds like that trade was a great relief for you.
Yes, it was a total catharsis. I realized that there was a reason why I had lost the money in the first
place.
What was the reason?
Because I was inexperienced. I don't believe anyone ever gets wiped out in the market because of
bad luck; there is always some other reason for it. Either you were off when you did the trade, or
you didn't have the experience. There is always a mistake involved.
You mentioned earlier that one of the reasons you split with your former trading partner was
that your own trading style was geared to extremely low risk. Since 1980, what was the worst
percentage drawdown you have experienced?
I lose so infrequently that I don't really keep track of that type of number.
Well, let's put it this way: What was your worst single trading month?
I haven't had any losing months.
You have made money in every single month since 1980! ,
Yes. Of course, I could have made a lot more money if I wasn't so cautious, but that is the way I
trade.
Do you remember your worst losing week?
I haven't had any losing weeks during that time, but I have had some losing days.
That is an incredible statement. How can you be sure that you are not simply forgetting about
a few weeks when you lost money trading?
The reason I am sure is that I remember all my losses. For example, I have had three losing days in
the last two years. Out of the thousands of trades I made during that time, I had 17 losers, but nine
of them were because my quote machine was down, and when that happens I just get out of my

==================================================

position.
Most traders would be happy winning on 50 percent of their trades, and a win ratio of 75
percent would be spectacular, yet you are implying that your win ratio is somewhere in the vicinity
of 99 percent—that is really hard to believe.
You can check with Leigh. I told him about hundreds of my trades during the past few years.
[Leigh Stevens is a mutual friend who introduced me to Weinstein.]
OK reader, I know what you are saying: '"No losing weeks, but I've had some losing days.' Give me
a break." Frankly, I admit Weinstein's statements sound preposterous. I could not verify his claims
by examining account statements because his partners are vigorous in maintaining the
confidentiality of the partnership's trading activity as it is a private trading firm, not open to the
public. In fact, a number of his partners were adamantly opposed to this interview and were nearly
successful in dissuading Weinstein from participating. The only account statement Weinstein was
willing, or able, to show me was his independent entry in the option trading contest, which did
indeed confirm that he multiplied a $ 100,000 account ninefold in three months with 100 percent
winning trades.
Still unsatisfied, I spoke to Leigh, who has known Weinstein for years and has spent many days
watching him trade. I have known Leigh for three years and can confidently describe him as honest,
low-keyed, and levelheaded. Leigh confirmed that of about 100 of Weinstein's trades he had
personally witnessed and several hundred more Weinstein told him about on the phone (right after
he put them on), he could remember only one that was a loser. Even if because of faulty memory (I
mean this literally, not as a euphemism for dishonesty), Weinstein's actual percentage winning rate
is somewhat lower than he implies, I still believe his win/loss ratio is incredibly high.
How can he do it? Weinstein's own response to this query follows, but to put it in perspective, I
thought some further elaboration would be helpful. Weinstein employs his own custom-designed
state-of-the-art computer systems to monitor constantly technical indicators designed to measure
changes in market momentum. Rather than use the standard values for these indicators, Weinstein
uses his own values, which he frequently adjusts for changing market conditions. He combines this
intensive real-time analysis with comprehensive chart analysis incorporating a variety of
methodologies, including cycles, Fibonacci retracements, and Elliott Wave analysis. Finally, add to
this one last essential ingredient: an uncanny sense of market timing. Only when nearly everything
lines up right and he feels the timing is virtually perfect does he put on a trade. He passes up many
trades that he believes have a high probability of working, but for which he lacks the same degree
of near absolute confidence. Because of the combination of a lifetime devotion to studying the
markets, intensive real-time analysis, innate market sense and incredibly rigorous trade selection,
virtually all of Weinstein's trades are at least marginally profitable at some point within twenty
minutes of entry. That is all Weinstein needs to assure a breakeven or better result.
It helps to understand that Weinstein usually plays for quick profits and covers his trades within
hours or even minutes. Even on position trades, Weinstein will usually take some profits quickly to
assure a net profitable outcome. He also trades markets in rotation, quickly shifting his profits from
market to market, always seeking the profit potential with the lowest perceived risk. Finally,
Weinstein enjoys the support of a floor network that often puts him on the right side of the bid-
asked spread.
Weinstein's comments may sound like boasting on the written page, but that belies their tone—
naiveté would be a much closer description. When Weinstein talks about trades, his comments are
peppered with phrases such as, "It's obvious the market is going lower," "This market is so easy." It
is clear he has no conception of how difficult trading is for the rest of us.
How do you explain your ability to win such a high percentage of the time?
Because I have a real fear of the markets. I have found that the greatest traders are the ones who are
most afraid of the markets. My fear of the markets has forced me to hone my timing with great
precision. When I am trading properly, it is like a pool player running racks. If my gut feel of
market conditions is not right, I don't trade. My timing is a combination of experience and my
nervous system. If my nervous system tells me to get out of the position, it is because the market
action triggers something in my knowledge and experience that I have seen before.

==================================================

I also don't lose much on my trades, because I wait for the exact right moment. Most people will
not wait for the environment to tip itself off. They will walk into the forest when it is still dark,
while I wait until it gets light. Although the cheetah is the fastest animal in the world and can catch
any animal on the plains, it will wait until it is absolutely sure it can catch its prey. It may hide in
the bush for a week, waiting for just the right moment. It will wait for a baby antelope, and not just
any baby antelope, but preferably one that is also sick or lame. Only then, when there is no chance
it can lose its prey, does it attack. That, to me, is the epitome of professional trading.
When I trade at home, I often watch the sparrows in my garden. When I feed them bread, they take
just a little piece at a time and fly away. They keep on flying back and forth, taking small bits of
bread. They may have to make a hundred stabs at a piece of bread to get what a pigeon gets at one
time, but that is why a pigeon is a pigeon. You will never be able to shoot a sparrow, it is just too
fast. That is the way I day trade. For example, there are times during the day when I am sure that
the S&P is going up, but I don't try to pick the bottom, and I am out before it tops. I just take the
mid-range where the momentum is greatest. That, to me, is trading like a sparrow eats.
Am I paraphrasing you correctly? The cheetah is your analogy for position trading and the
sparrow is your analogy for day trading. The common denominator is that both animals wait
for can't-lose circumstances.
Exactly.
How do you pick your trades?
I use many different types of technical input: charts, Elliott Wave and Gann analysis, Fibonacci
numbers, cycles, sentiment, moving averages, and various oscillators. People think that technical
analysis is unreliable because they tend to pick the one thing they are comfortable with. The
problem is that no single technical approach works all the time. You have to know when to use
each method.
How do you do that?
It is experience and gut feel. I use all forms of technical analysis, but interpret them through gut
feel. I do not believe in mathematical systems that always approach markets in the same way.
Using myself as the "system," I constantly change the input to achieve the same output—profit!
Is there anything you can single out as the most important element in deciding to put on a
trade?
I am always looking for a market that is losing momentum, and then go the other way.
Having traded both the stock and commodity markets, would you say they behave
differently?
Absolutely. In contrast to the commodity markets, the stock market very rarely gives you the
opportunity to enjoy a meaningful trend.
Why is that?
Because when institutions and specialists sell out, they don't sell out at one price level, they scale
out as the market goes up. Similarly, when they buy, they scale in as the market goes down. This
leads to choppier price action and is the reason why many good commodity traders that I know lose
every time they go into the stock market.
But you win consistently in the stock market, as well. What are you doing differently?
I don't try to figure out where the market is going before the action; I let the market tell me where it
is going. Also, there is such a variety of technical input in the stock market (divergence,
advance/decline, sentiment, put/call ratios, and so on), that you will almost always get a signal
before the market is about to do something.
Is your method of technical analysis therefore different in the stock market than in the
commodity markets?
I look at the individual stocks; they all have their own personalities. For example, IBM and General
Motors will usually rally before a major market bottom and fail to rally before a major market top.
As another example, I have never seen a real good rally without the utilities leading the market.

                     PAGE 164                     
==================================================

The utilities go up when interest rates are expected to come down, and when interest rates come
down, portfolio managers jump into stocks. I have done extremely well trading the indexes,
because before I ever traded index futures, I had become a very experienced trader of stocks and
options.
What do you think is the public's biggest misconception about the markets?
That people who trade the markets gamble. I know floor traders that have made money for twenty
straight years. You can't call that gambling.
Another major misconception is that people always expect the market to react to news. For
example, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the market initially broke very sharply, but then
quickly rebounded to new highs. This price action baffled many people. Investors who sold on the
news only to watch the market reverse blamed the institutions for pushing the market higher. What
they failed to realize is that a market that is fundamentally and technically poised to move higher is
not going to reverse direction because of a news item—even a dramatic one.
Another item I would place under the category of misconceptions is the way the media reports the
reasons for the market being down. They are always saying that the market is down because of
profit taking. I think it would be wonderful if everybody was always taking profits. But, the truth is,
most people lose money, and the reason markets go down is because they take their losses. I know
educated people who watch the news and wonder why the hell they lost money when everyone else
is taking profits. The media owes it to the public to report that the market goes down not only on
profit taking, but on a lot of loss taking as well.
What are the trading rules you live by?
1. Always do your homework.
2. Don't be arrogant. When you get arrogant, you forsake risk control. The best traders are the most
humble.
3. Understand your limitations. Everyone has limitations—even the best traders.
4. Be your own person. Think against the herd, as they must lose in time. Don't trade until an
opportunity presents itself. Knowing when to stay out of the markets is as important as knowing
when to be in them.
5. Your strategy has to be flexible enough to change when the environment changes. The mistake
most people make is they keep the same strategy all the time. They say, "Damn, the market didn't
behave the way I thought it would." Why should it? Life and the markets just don't work that way.
6. Don't get too complacent once you have made profits. The toughest thing in the world is holding
on to profits. That is because once you have attained a goal, you then set a second goal that is
usually the same as the first one: to make more money. Consequently, for many people, attainment
of that second goal is not as rewarding. They may begin to question what they really want from
trading and trigger a self-destruct process in which they wind up losing.
Any final advice you have for the beginning trader?
You have to learn how to lose; it is more important than learning how to win. If you think you are
always going to be a winner, when you lose, you will develop feelings of hostility and end up
blaming the market instead of trying to learn why you lost.
Limit losses quickly. To paraphrase from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, most traders hold on
to their losses too long because they hope the loss will not get larger. They take profits too soon,
because they fear the profit will diminish. Instead, traders should fear a larger loss and hope for a
larger profit.
Weinstein's most traumatic trading experience occurred when he let a material goal interfere with
his trading. This is a common theme that has surfaced in other interviews. It invariably seems to be
a mistake to translate the potential profit or loss of a trade into material terms.
The cornerstone of Weinstein's trading approach is to wait for those trades in which everything
appears to be lined up exactly right, and the odds of winning seem overwhelming. Even though
most of us can never expect to remotely approach Weinstein's confidence in the trades he selects,
the concept of waiting for only those trades one feels most confident about is sound advice that is
echoed by a number of traders in this book.
Although viewing markets as nonrandom over the long run, I have long believed that very short-

term market fluctuations (i.e., intraday price movements) were largely random. Weinstein has
shaken this belief.

Brian Gelber-Broker Turned Trader
Brian Gelber began his career as a broker, managing a major brokerage firm's financial futures
operations on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. After successfully advising institutional
clients, he began trading for his own account. In the early days of T-bond futures trading, Gelber
enjoyed the dual distinction of being one of the most (if not the most) prominent brokers on the
floor and one of the largest local traders.
In January 1986, Gelber expanded his trading to include the direct management of customer
accounts. In addition to his own trading, Gelber supervises a group of traders in both cash and
futures in government securities and othermarkets. He is the president of a group of companies:
Gelber Group, Gelber Management, and Gelber Securities. These companies are involved in
clearing, brokerage, and money management.
Gelber's relaxed personality seemed almost out of place with his profession. Instead of the high
level of intensity expected of someone who trades and supervises trading in multimillion dollar
bond positions daily, I found a man who talks about his work as if he were describing a pleasant
vacation.
Although our meeting took place during trading hours, Gelber did not seem to be overly concerned
with the bond market. In fact, he seemed quite relaxed, despite leaving the trading desk for his
private office to conduct our interview. "I'll probably do better by staying here," he remarked,
obviously reflecting what he perceived to be a low-opportunity market at the time.
In response to a query regarding other traders I was interviewing, I mentioned that one, Tony
Saliba, had made the cover of the current issue of Success magazine. Gelber asked me if I had a
copy. I pulled out the magazine from my attache case and handed it to him. He smiled as he read
the bold headline describing Saliba's experience during the week of the October 19,1987, stock
market crash: "Victory! He Made $4 Million in Seventy-Two Hours." Jokingly, Gelber asked, "I
made $4 million in twenty minutes on that day; how come I'm not on a magazine cover?" It was not
meant to be boastful. It did, however, very specifically summarize a basic truth about great traders:
Many, if not most, maintain relatively low profiles and are therefore virtually unknown to the
public.
How did you get started in this industry?
After graduating from college in 1976,1 backpacked around the country. In Salt Lake City, I
answered an ad for a commodity broker position. I didn't have any idea what it was, but I figured it
was something like a stockbroker. I got my license while working for a guy who was basically
running a boiler room operation.
You really started out on the wrong side of the business.
When I walked in, there was a guy seated at the back end of a penny stock office. He spent his days
on the phone trying to convince people to give him $5,000 or $10,000 to speculate onhis charting
system. It was a real fly-by-night operation.
I was keeping his charts for him, while getting registered. I kept saying to myself, "This guy is
pretty much of a crook." I got my license and quit. Then I bummed around for another few months,
just working temporary jobs to pay the rent.
What kind of jobs?
Unloading railroad cars. Then one day I walked into a Thomson McKin-non office and said, "Hey,
I have a broker's license." The fellow there said he would pay me $800 a month. That was a large
amount of money for me at the time. All I had to do was go in and cold call; any accounts I opened
would be mine.
But you knew virtually nothing at all about markets at that time.
I had read a couple of books, and I knew something about charts—having kept them for the first
fellow I worked for.
What books did you read? There weren't too many around at that time.
The book I learned the most from was Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by Robert D. Edwards
and John Magee (John Magee, Inc., 109 State Street, Boston, MA).
168



==================================================
                     PAGE 169                     
==================================================

What other books would you recommend to people?
The first book we have our traders read is Edwin Lefevre's account of Jesse Livermore,
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator [Reprinted in 1985 from the original 1923 edition by Trader
Press, Inc., Greenville, SC.] I've read it at least a dozen times.
Anyway, around the time that I started at Thomson McKinnon, the Ginnie Mae market was just
coming into its own. Thomson McKinnon had just hired a trading group to run a Ginnie Mae desk.
I told them I was interested in learning more about the Ginnie Mae market.
Why were you attracted to that market?
It was a new market and seemed more manageable than the conventional commodities. I figured
my business would grow more steadily if I focused on that market. Also, I had made a number of
trades in Ginnie Maes. The first trade was a winner, but the following ones were all losers.
It was magnetic; I felt I could make money there, but I kept losing, and that made me want to learn
more about it.
It sounds like you had a minor compulsion to pursue it.
Yes, because I had failed. Anyway, the traders at the Ginnie Mae desk taught me a few things, and
I went out and opened almost every mortgage banker account in Salt Lake.
Did you understand the Ginnie Mae market at that time?
When I first started opening accounts, I didn't understand anything about it.
How then did you sell people on yourself?
I snowballed them at first, but I listened and I learned from the questions they asked me. Initially, I
was confused by what they were doing, and they were equally confused by what I was trying to sell
them.
At least you understood futures as an instrument.
Right. And with that limited knowledge, I bumbled through my first few meetings. Then I really
got pretty good at it.
Were these hedging accounts?
Yes, all pure hedging accounts. By May 1977,1 was making $2,000 a month in commissions. That
was a tremendous amount of money for me.
Was this all in the Ginnie Mae market?
At that point, yes. Previously, I had done some brokerage in other commodity markets such as
wheat, hogs, and pork bellies.
Who were those trades for?
Just accounts I had opened by cold calling—people who really didn't understand that they could
lose, and when they lost, they were always upset.
Were you giving them trading suggestions?
Pretty much.
Using chart analysis?
Believe it or not, more off the research of Thomson McKinnon analysts, and secondarily off my
charts. Newer brokers definitely tend to rely on their firm's research.
Did your customers lose because the research was wrong?
No. They lost because their time horizon was mostly day to day, while the research was longer
term.
So there was a mismatch?
Exactly. I think that is a basic problem between most brokers and their customers. It is almost
impossible to get market information to your customer quickly enough for the customer to act on it.
What you are saying is that even if a broker can actually beat the market trading short term,
he can't translate that to the customer.
Insurmountable odds, because you have two people who have to pull the trigger, and the
169



==================================================
                     PAGE 170                     
==================================================

information changes so quickly.
So, one of the points of advice you would give to speculators is to trade with a longer-term
perspective?
Yes, you have to. , ,
Let's talk about floor trading. I know, at one point, you were both a floor broker and trader
in the T-bond futures market. The question I think a lot of people would ask is: If you receive
a large customer sell order at the same time you're thinking of closing out your own long
position, how do you handle it?
I never scalped, so the idea of being long and having a large customer order move the market
against me 2 or 3 ticks never made any difference. Besides, I had so many customers that they were
often going opposite ways.
OK, that's an easy one. But what if some important news was breaking, and all your
customer orders were going one way against your own position? Did you ever end up trapped
in a position because you had to execute all the customer orders first?
Yes, that happened to me about half a dozen times, and it probably cost me a grand total of a half
million dollars over a number of years. But measured against the amount of money I was making, it
didn't kill me.
That was the cost of doing business?
Right.
It must be a gut-wrenching situation though, knowing you want to get out, but not being able
to act because of a conflict with customer orders.
Usually, you are too busy acting as a broker and thinking, "OK, I have to sell 1,000 lots; how can I
do it best?" Then, when you are done with the order, you might say to yourself, "Oh damn, I'm still
long; I have to get out of this thing."
Is there a built-in disadvantage for a floor trader who also handles customer orders?
Absolutely. As I tell the people I hire, "If you are a broker, you are not a trader; if you are a trader,
you are not a broker."
But you were.
It was a wild time. I was the biggest trader and the biggest broker in the same market. I worked
very long hours and was totally exhausted when I went home. Then I would just get up the next day
and do it again. This went on for three years, and while it was a great experience, I really shouldn't
have done it. You can't be a great broker and a great trader. I did a good job, but it probably took
years off my life.
Are most of the significant size traders on the floor just traders, or do some also handle
customers?
They all are either brokers or traders now. That is the only way to go; there is no doubt about it.
Is that true of most floors, or just the T-bond floor?
Primarily, the T-bond floor. In the S&P and in the New York markets, some of the big brokers are
also big traders.
Given today's increased scrutiny, are people who violate the confidence of dual trading
[handling customer orders and trading one's own account] likely to get caught?
It is still very difficult to create a flawless audit trail in an open outcry market.
Say bonds are trading at 95.00 and the market gets hit with some bearish news. The broker
executes a large amount of orders for customers and his own account, and the market goes
straight from 95.00 to 94.00. His Tills are 94.31, 94.30, 94.29 and all his customers get fills at
94.27 or lower. [Bond prices trade in 32nds.] How does he explain his way out of that one?
He could give his order or his customers' orders to another broker. Or he could fill both orders and
put another broker's number on his own order. There are always ways to get around extra scrutiny.
The smart crooks will always be difficult to catch.

                     PAGE 171                     
==================================================

Is the temptation in dual trading too great?
No. After having been through it, I would say that dual trading is good for efficiency in the
marketplace, but it is too heavy a burden for the individual.
Should the rules be changed to disallow dual trading?
That is a difficult question. What is more important, the efficiency of the market or the integrity of
the individual? There is no doubt in my mind that dual trading adds tremendous liquidity to the
system, and that is probably more important than the fact that a small percentage of dual traders
may cheat. Besides, even if dual trading were banned, the stealers would still find a way to steal.
That is their perception of how to make money in this business.
When did you first get involved in the T-bond market?
hi September 1977,1 moved to Chicago and became a broker on the T-bond floor. I was just
twenty-five and I got lucky. I went to New York in November 1977 and met with eight big-name
companies, seven of whom opened accounts. I was at the right place at the right time.
When did you start trading for your own account on the floor?
In 1979.
Were you tempted to give up your floor brokerage so that you could concentrate on trading?
Actually, it was just the opposite. I had started out as a customer's man, and from 1979 through
1981,1 built a massive customer base. We were a powerful force in the market at that time.
Probably the saddest thing I ever did was to became a trader too. I was a great broker in my
twenties, and if I had parlayed that for ten years, I probably would have ended up where I am now
without enduring all the pains of trading. I consider trading to be an unrewarding, unglamorous
game.
It's odd you say that, because you have been far more successful than most traders.
I guess my point is that as a broker I was at an even higher echelon. I was really good at it, and it
suited my personality.
So, why did you get into trading?
I started trading because some of my customers said, "You know the market so well, why don't you
just trade?" I resisted at first, but after six months of holding out, I started trading. From there it just
evolved.
Do you remember your first trades?
My first trade was a long position, and I made some money. Then I put on a long bond/short Ginnie
Mae spread, which was almost like being long. The market went down, and I lost all the money I
had made, plus $50,000 more. Since I was making about $50,000 per month as a broker, my
attitude was that I basically broke even that month. But I didn't like the feeling at all. So, I cut my
position size down and started trading a little more actively. This happened during the bear market
of 1979. The problem was that I was bullish all the way down.
Why were you bullish?
My customers kept telling me that rates couldn't go much higher.* For example, I was handling the
orders for CitiBank and Citicorp and they were buying all the way down. These were renowned
people saying that they had an opinion and backing it up with deeds.
*Bond prices fall when interest rates rise. This is a basic concept that is sometimes confusing to the
novice. The reason that bond prices decline if rates increase can be explained as follows: If rates
rise, itmeans that all existinglower-yieldinginstruments are less attractive to investors. To induce an
investor to purchase these lower-coupon bonds, their prices must fall sufficiently so that the return
is equivalent to the return on the higher-coupon bond purchased at face value.
What would you do today in the same situation?
Now, I know the characteristics of various institutions. Let's take Citi-Bank. Back then, I was
buying because they were buying. Now, if Citi-Bank was buying, I might conclude that they were
just reallocating their assets or changing the duration of their portfolio. Today, I have little regard
for the views of portfolio managers, because their outlook tends to cover a much longer time
171



==================================================
                     PAGE 172                     
==================================================

perspective than mine. I didn't understand that back then.
So, you don't pay much attention to those types of opinions anymore?
I listen to them in passing. I don't read the Barren's interviews of portfolio managers anymore. It
never did much for me, and I don't think it does much for any trader.
In other words, the problem wasn't the fact that you were listening to other people, but that
you were listening to the wrong people.
I didn't know how to decide which were the right or wrong people. I was a naive kid saying, "Here
is a major account that is buying a lot of stuff; the market should go up."
You really had no strategy, no plan, no system. You were just shooting from the hip.
That's right. Then over time, I started to get a grip on how to make money. As opposed to saying, "I
have an opinion and I want to express it in the market," I started asking, "How do I make money
out of all this?"
What had you learned by that point?
I had learned that an opinion isn't worth that much. It is more important to listen to the market. I
became a reactive trader as opposed to an opinionated trader.
In 1980, one of my customers was Solomon Brothers. At the time, they were bearish on bonds from
65 to 80. If I had listened to my big customers as I had done in 1979,1 would have thrown away
money all over again.
What told you not to listen to your customers then?
The 1979 experience of losing money based on someone else's opinion—a sound opinion by
intelligent people that was just absolutely wrong.
Where were your successes coming from?
I learned how to read the tape and developed good instincts. We were such big players in bonds
back then—we, meaning my customers and myself—that the spots we picked to trade could
virtually stop the market. We were actually creating some of the support and resistance points. It
didn't take that much to do it back then. I think there was a streak of months when I hardly had any
losing days.
Could you have done it without the commercial accounts?
I would hope that I could have done it without them; that it wasn't a self-fulfilling prophecy. But if
it was, fine. I don't know.
When did that streak end?
From a trading standpoint, I never had a losing year until 1986, although I did struggle in 1985
during the mid-stages of the bull market in bonds.
Was your trading success a matter of being able to read the tape?
Yes. I was attentive and had good instincts.
It sounds like you are saying that either you are born to be a good trader or you are not.
Well, to a certain extent, that may be true. My feeling is that you don't have to be, but it helps.
Is it a matter of having a sixth sense about the market?
Yes. Your gut often tells you what to do.
Are people who don't have the natural instincts for trading wasting their time? Or can almost
anybody be successful if he or she works at it hard enough?
Working hard has nothing to do with it. About two weeks ago, a very bright fellow who works
forme said, "This is a very frustrating business. It doesn't matter how hard I work; it has no bearing
on whether I make money or not." You have to know yourself and put that knowledge to work in
the market.
That sounds like a cliche. What do you mean by "know yourself"?
I'll give you an example. I think I'm a good trader, but there is a guy working for me who is better. I
could go out there and beat my head against the desk and try to outdo him, or I can just be myself.
172

==================================================

Let him make whatever he can, and I'll make whatever I can.
This is my view of a year in the life of a trader: Four out of twelve months you are hot. You are so
excited that you can't sleep at night. You can't wait to get to work the next day; you're just rolling.
Two months out of the year, you are cold. You are so cold, you are miserable. You can't sleep at
night. You can't figure out where the next trade is going to come from. The other six months out of
the year, you make and lose, make and lose. You can't sleep, because you are trying to figure out
how you are going to make money.
The net result is that you never sleep, because you are constantly thinking too much about trading.
It is an all-consuming thing. That is why you need to know yourself—to moderate your emotions.
If you don't, then after a big success, you are high as a kite. You are not prepared when just around
the corner, the market suddenly brings you back to earth. Or, in the opposite situation, when you
are consistently losing, you might end up jumping out of a window. Why did I leave the floor?
Again, because I know myself. I need to interact with people and that doesn't happen there.
Being on the floor sounds like a very intense thing to be doing day in, day out. Does it
physically grind you down?
Absolutely. You can see that in the older fellows. When you are in your twenties and thirties, you
can rebound pretty well from the physical and mental stress. As you get older, you don't rebound as
well, and you have to push harder to maintain your performance.
It sounds like professional sports. You get to a certain age and no matter how good you
were—
That's right. It's exactly like that.
Out of every 100 people who go to the floor to become traders, how many will make at least a
million dollars within five years?
Maybe five or less.
How many will end up losing everything they came in with?
At least half.
You have been more successful than most traders. What do you attribute your success to?
The reason I have been so consistent is that I'm a great listener. I probably talk to about twenty-five
traders each day. Most traders don't listen to your opinion; they only want to tell you their opinion.
I am different because I honestly and truly listen to what they say and how they say it. For example,
if one of the major locals calls me up three days in a row when the market has rallied, and he is
asking me what I think, I know that he has been selling and is not sure of his position.
What does that tell you?
If it is in line with what the other traders I talk to are doing, it tells me the market will probably go
higher.
So if you talk to twenty-five people, and twenty of them are nervous about the market going
higher because implicitly they are short, does that tell you that you should be trading on the
long side?
Yes. I know a large number of people in the industry and that is a big plus. I listen to them. I go
with the people who are hot. Sure, I can form my own opinion, but that is not what makes me do
the things I do in the market. Sometimes, Iknow my opinion is right, and I'll go with it. Sometimes,
I know somebody else is hot, and I'll go with their opinion. I'm not picky about how I make my
money. It doesn't matter if my opinion is right or wrong. All that matters is whether I make money.
Doesn't it get confusing when you talk to twenty-five people and fifteen are bullish and ten
are bearish?
Sometimes, but I've been doing this since 1976. I've always been able to read people very well,
even though no one thinks I listen. For example, I have one trader here who is cold as ice right
now. All I have to do is listen to him. Last night, he told me he wanted to be short. I knew that I
was going to be long.
As long as he is cold?

==================================================
                     PAGE 174                     
==================================================

Right, and the one time he gets hot, fine. When the guy is cold, he is cold. You can't say to a trader,
"You're cold, you can't trade." You have to let them run their course.
Is reading other traders a key component of your personal trading right now?
Yes, I'm pliable. I know these people, so I understand how to read them. I don't want to hear what
Jack Schwager says, because I don't know him. I only want to talk to people I know very well.
What other things are important to your trading success?
The realization that when you don't care, you do well, and when you try too hard, you don't do well.
By "trying too hard," do you mean pressing when there is no trade?
Pressing is one of the reasons I'm sitting in here with you for so long during trading hours. The
markets haven't traded well in weeks, and we are proud of ourselves for not having thrown a lot of
money away.
So when the opportunities aren't there, you just lay fairly low?
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not that good at that, but I have gotten better as I've gotten older. I've
learned that lesson over the last couple of years. After Richard Dennis left the floor, he said: "The
first year I left the floor was the most painful experience for me, and I have paid the largest tuition I
ever have." It was the same with me.
What was the motivation for coming off the floor, since you were so successful there?
I felt that the industry had developed to the point where my brokerage skills were no longer needed.
All anyone wanted to know was: "Where's the next tick?" "How can I move size?" The price to be
paid for my particular skills was too low.
You are talking in terms of customer business?
Customer business and trading. The market had gotten so voluminous that my style of swing
trading was worthless. It got to the point where I was just trying to read the next tick instead of the
next 8 ticks.
Why couldn't you play the same game?
The volume was too big; capitalization was too big. I couldn't read the market from the floor.
Because there were too many players?
Exactly. In the early days of T-bond futures trading, the depth was low and you could read when
people were overextended long or short. You couldn't do that anymore.
Did your performance start decreasing; did you see the handwriting on the wall?
In 1985,1 made under a million dollars trading for the first time and I knew something was wrong. I
had always been a very consistent trader, making more money each year. I looked at my results and
found that my profits were smaller, meaning 3 and 4 ticks, and my losses were greater. My first
reaction was to become a much more active pit trader. I found that I was taking on tremendous
positions and the risk/reward was insane. That was when I became convinced that I had to make a
change.
Were you just lucky that you didn't get hit really hard during that period on any particular
trade?
Actually, I did get hit pretty hard a couple of times, but I had some good winners too. The point is
that as I worked harder and harder, I found that all I was doing was running in place. I don't like to
work hard at trading, and here I was just mentally and physically exhausting myself.
If you had been doing as well as in previous years, would you have stayed in the pit?
Yes. The pit is a very stimulating environment. Off the floor, you have to force yourself to be
motivated each day. That was a very difficult transition.
Is it harder to trade off the floor?
Not in the long run. My profitability in 1987 and 1988 has been pretty good.
You mentioned that your first year off the floor was very difficult. Was the main problem
that you were still trying to trade the market as you did on the floor?
174



==================================================
                     PAGE 175                     
==================================================

Yes, that was the number one reason. The second reason was that the transition occurred during the
1986 runaway bull market. I was bound to lose because my style was not based on following
trends.
Is that still true?
No, it has changed. I've gotten better. I can still countertrend trade real well, but I found you can
also make a lot of money trend following.
Do you use trading systems?
No, we are "discretionary traders." We only use technical indicators and systems as trading tools.
One particularly interesting system we have developed is based on quirks related to volatility. Our
belief is that volatility offers clues to trend direction. Although we've found through backtesting
that this system gives you good signals, we do not blindly follow the trades.
For an automated, computerized system, what would you consider good results in terms of
average annual return?
About 40 to 50 percent, with maximum equity drawdowns under 10 percent.
But systems will always have larger maximum drawdowns than that.
That is why we haven't directly traded money on them.
Do you think any system can compete with a good trader?
I haven't seen one yet, although there may be one somewhere.
There are some traders who have the skills, but who don't succeed. What is it that keeps them
from becoming successful?
Most traders who fail have large egos and can't admit that they are wrong. Even those who are
willing to admit that they are wrong early in their career can't admit it later on. Also, some traders
fail because they are too worried about losing.
In other words, successful trading is a matter of trying to avoid losses, but not being afraid of
them.
That is a good way to put it. I'm not afraid to lose. When you start being afraid to lose, you're
finished.
Is the ability to accept losses a characteristic of a winning trader?
Yes. Tom Baldwin is a good example. He only trades the market; he doesn't trade size or equity. By
that I mean, he doesn't say to himself, "I am long 2,000 contracts. Oh my God, that is too many, I
have to sell some." He never looks at it that way. He will sell either when he thinks the market has
gone up too far, or when he thinks that his position is wrong.
In your trading experience, is there one particular trade that stands out as the most
dramatic?
In 1986, when the long bond was being cornered by the Japanese, there was a big, emotional rally
on a Monday morning. I had thought the market was too high at 90.00, and here it was trading over
91.00. So I sold 1,100 contracts scale-up above that level. The market backed down and was
offered 1,000 lots at 91.00. Just as I was thinking that I had this trade nailed, in less than five
minutes the market reversed and soared to 92.00.
I was down $1 million, and the market was only a few ticks away from limit bid. I had never lost so
much money, so fast, and it was because I did things differently than I normally do.
What specifically?
I usually don't trade that big early in the year. I like to make money gradually at first and then play
with the money I have made.
It sounds like part of your money-management philosophy is based on treating each year
independently.
Right. Anyway, I sold a little bit more up at the highs, and from that point on, I was only concerned
with covering. I waited patiently, and the market started coming back down. I ended up losing only
$400,000 for the day, not all that bad considering where I was earlier. But that trade had a big
175



==================================================
                     PAGE 176                     
==================================================

emotional impact on me. I was flabbergasted by the market action. I had forgotten that markets
could run away like that. I couldn't believe how wrong I had been.
What did you mean earlier when you said the Japanese cornered the market?
When the Japanese want to buy something, their big thing is market share. This was the first time
the U.S. got a good feel of how the Japanese buy securities—they buy them all.
Was this the move that drove us to the highs in the bond market?
That's right.
So, apparently, the Japanese weren't as fazed by the yield being so low for all the risk implied
in a long bond position.
I don't think they look at it in terms of yield. Rather, they view things as whether prices are going
up, and if they are, they buy. Every time they would buy, prices would go up, and they would buy
some more.
The bond market has collapsed again since then; did they get out of their position in time?
Sure. Do you know who bought the most at the highs? The U.S. dealers who desperately needed to
cover because they had sold on the way up.
Are the Japanese smart traders then?
No, they just have a style. They are cannonball traders. They go one way, and they all go together.
A friend of mine at one of the Japanese shops told me about a Japanese trader who bought just
about every long bond on the screen. About fifteen minutes later he called back and asked, "Why is
the basis [the price spread between cash T-bonds and T-bond futures] going out?" Naively, the
Japanese trader had noticed that cash prices had gone way up, while futures didn't go up very much.
My friend told him, "Well, you just bought every bond available. Of course, the basis is going to go
out." They didn't really understand the impact of their trading.
The Japanese did much the same thing in the U.S. equity market in 1987 as they did in bonds in
1986. They practically took control of it, buying because prices kept going higher.
Г11 never forgive myself for not buying stocks and selling bonds in 1987. That was going to be my
number one trade in 1987.
Was the reasoning that the bond market had already run way up, while stocks hadn't? Did
you just believe the two markets were out of line valuewise?
That's right. Also, we knew the Japanese were buying the high-capitalization U.S. stocks. Having
already learned their buying style in the bond market, the trade was even more obvious.
Then why didn't you do it?
The spread between the S&P and the T-bond contract was trading between $19,000 and $25,000 on
a one-to-one contract value basis. I went on a four-day vacation, and in just a few days, Japanese
buying in the stock market had pushed the spread to $30,000.
Why didn't you buy the spread before the vacation, since you had the idea?
I was waiting for the spread to break out above its trading range. I wanted to buy it above $26,000.
At a $30,000 spread, I just couldn'tpull the trigger.
What is the key trading rule you live by?
Never add to a loser.
What does the average trader do wrong?
He overtrades and begs for tips.
How do you handle a losing streak?
I instinctively trade smaller and sometimes I just take a break. It is a good habit to wipe the slate
clean and start fresh.
When you are going bad, but still have some good positions on, do you liquidate them as well?
Absolutely. They are bound to turn against you too.
I found the subjects of dual trading and the Japanese impact on the U.S. T-bond market among the
most interesting portions of my conversation with Brian Gelber. These subjects, however, did not
176

                     PAGE 177                     
==================================================

provide any insights into the art of trading. On a more practical note, one of the primary caveats
provided by Gelber concerned the misuse of brokerage research. He noted a tendency for the broker
and client to use longer-term research for short-term trading. This misapplication of information
often leads to trading losses, even when the research is right.
Clearly, flexibility and suppression of ego are key elements of Gelber's success. Referring to hot
traders, he notes, "I'll go with their opinion.... It doesn't matter if I'm right. All that matters is
whether I make money."
Finally, Gelber's reaction to losing streaks is one cited by a number of traders. He advises wiping
the slate clean and starting fresh. Getting out of everything allows the trader to achieve greater
clarity. Liquidated positions, if they still appear attractive, can always be reentered once the trader
has regained his confidence.

Tom Baldwin-The Fearless Pit Trader
The trading pit of an active futures market is an imposing place. Scores of traders push over each
other, while shouting buy and sell orders at the top of their lungs. To the uninitiated, it seems
miraculous that this institutionalized bedlam actually functions efficiently as a process for ex-
ecuting orders. In the frenzied world of futures pits, the T-bond ring, with over 500 traders, stands
out as the unchallenged giant. The pit is so large that one side of the ring often does not know what
is happening on the other side.
By most accounts, Tom Baldwin is the single largest individual trader in the T-bond pit. His trading
size puts him in the same league as the primary institutional players. Single trades as large as 2,000
contracts ($200 million face value T-bonds) are not unusual for him. On a typical day, he may trade
over 20,000 contracts (the equivalent of $2 billion in face value T-bonds). Baldwin is in his early
thirties, having begun trading T-bonds a scant six years ago.
Baldwin's entry into the world of floor trading sounds more like a recipe for failure than success. In
1982, with no prior trading experience, Baldwin left his job as a product manager for a meat-
packing firm to lease a seat on the Chicago Board of Trade. His stake was only $25,000. Out of this
skimpy capital base, he had to pay over $2,000 per month to lease the seat, and at least another
$1,000 per month for living expenses. As if this were not enough, his wife was pregnant at the time.
Obviously, Baldwin is not one to play it safe. His aggressive risk-taking posture is one of the key
elements of his success. He turned a profit from the beginning. He was a millionaire before his first
year was up and has never looked back. Although he declines to discuss the extent of his winnings,
$30 million appears to be a conservative estimate. The true figure could be significantly higher.
I considered an interview with Baldwin essential to this project, because of his prominence as the
most successful floor trader in the world's largest futures market. Baldwin, however, was not eager
to be interviewed. Although he had done some interviews in the past, he had obviously grown
reluctant to do any more. Without Brian Gelber's generous intervention—the two are friends and
admire each other's trading abilities—this interview would never have taken place.
Gelber had warned me that Baldwin could be either abrasive or gracious, but to be prepared for the
former. As an example, Gelber said that Baldwin would probably answer the question of how he
first got involved in trading with the curt response: "I went down to the floor and began trading."
As it turned out, this was very close to the spirit of his answer.
I arrived at Baldwin's office several minutes after the end of the day's trading. Baldwin arrived a
few minutes later. Since he had just moved to new offices and the furniture had not yet been
delivered, the interview was conducted sitting on a window sill.
Baldwin's attitude was neither abrasive nor gracious; aloof might be the best way to describe it. I
had the distinct impression that the minute I hesitated in asking the next question, Baldwin would
be gone. It was St. Patrick's Day, and this impression was intensified each time someone left the
office saying that he or she would meet Baldwin at a local bar. I could sense that Tom was anxious
to join them. I decided to conduct the interview completely impromptu, shooting off a new question
the second he finished answering the prior one. Often his responses were quite short. I felt like a
photographer stalking a rare bird; one false step and the bird would fly off.
I knew that, at some point, I would not be able to think of an immediate follow-up question. This
happened about forty minutes into the interview. I quickly glanced down at my index cards,
searching for a lead. Unfortunately, my eyes focused on a question I had already touched upon, and
though I tried to ask it from a different perspective, it was too late. The game was over. Baldwin
said he had to get going and excused himself.
How did you first get interested in trading?
I had taken some classes in commodities in graduate school. I wanted to trade, but I didn't have the
money to buy a seat. In 1982, 1 found out I could lease a seat, and that's when I began.
Did you always want to trade as a local as opposed to any other type of trading?
Yes.
How did you learn to trade?
One lot at a time. I always had an opinion. All day long I stood there and developed an opinion. As
178



==================================================
                     PAGE 179                     
==================================================

I came to see that my opinion was right, I was reinforced, even if I didn't make the trade. Then
when I traded, I knew from standing there six hours a day, every day, that most of the time I was
right. I would see the same scenarios develop over and over again.
Are you talking about market patterns or traders doing certain things?
Both. Market patterns would occur over and over again, or market players would do the same thing
over and over again, and you just trade it.
What were your first few months like? Were you profitable initial-
I think the most I was ever down was 19 ticks, so I pretty much started out profitably.
Coming to the pits with no background, what was it that gave you enough of an edge to be
right on the market?
I worked hard. I stood there six hours a day, all day, every day.
But you didn't have any experience to fall back on.
You don't need it. You don't need any education at all to do it. The smarter you are, the dumber you
are. The more you know, the worse it is for you.
For your type of trading—that is, scalping—when you put on a trade, what are you looking
for?
To get as much as I can get out of it. I've taken full points or just 1 tick out of a trade. You just
never know. You have to watch the market, get a feel for it, and if you are in the right position, just
go with it.
On average, though, your trades will net out at a few ticks?
Yes. I probably average 4-tick profits on big positions.
I assume your holding time is probably very, very short.
I try to make it short.
Are we talking about minutes?
Yes, or seconds. Just because that is less risk. The object is always: Minimize your risk.
Have you always been a scalp-type trader?
Well, I evolved from a pure scalper to a combination of scalper and speculator.
Right now, what percentage of your trades are position versus scalp?
A small percentage, well below 10 percent.
Basically then, you are still using the same basic trading style yon started out with.
Right.
Do you use any technical input?
Yes. I use charts.
Do you use intraday charts, since you are trading short term?
No. Bar charts covering the past six months.
If you look at the charts and say, "I'm basically bullish," do you primarily scalp from the
long side?
Not necessarily. I would start with an opinion, but if I saw something to change my mind, I would
adjust.
Is the fact that you started off with a chart-influenced trading bias a key element behind your
winning?
Yes.
Were there periods when you were unsuccessful, or did you remain consistent?
Consistent.
Didn't you have any losing months?
Yes, I had one or two.
179



==================================================
                     PAGE 180                     
==================================================

But not two together?
No, never.
What percentage of those who come to trade on the floor are still around after five years,
versus losing their stake and dropping out?
Less than 20 percent. That is really the rale of thumb, and it's probably less than that.
What percentage are successful to the point of making and keeping at Least a couple of
million?
One percent.
In other words, a very small fraction of traders.
Right. It is like any other industry. How many people get to be president of General Motors?
Do you have an opinion about what separates the 1 percent from the other 99 percent?
Yes. It is a lot of hard work, for one. It's perseverance. You have to love to do it. Also, in our
business, you have to have a total disregard for money. You can't trade for money.
Do you mean as long as you like the position, you stay with it? That you can't think, "I'm
losing $1 million on this trade, and with $1 million I could have bought a great house." You
can't translate it into real terms.
Exactly. Most people do.
I guess another way of saying it is you have to have almost no fear.
Right.
Is that a characteristic of winning traders: They have less fear than the losers?
Yes.
Can you size up a new trader on the floor and tell if he is going to make it or not?
Yes.
What kind of things would tip you off that he is a loser?
Most important, losers don't work hard enough. Most people walk in and think there is a 50/50
chance on any trade. They don't think there is anything more to it than that. They don't concentrate.
They don't watch the factors that affect the market. You can see it in their eyes; it is almost as if
there is a wall in front of their face.
By factors, do you mean fundamentals?
No. Paying attention to what other markets are doing, such as the Dow Jones or gold. Watching the
traders in the pit.
Patterns?
Yes.
In other words, they are not paying enough attention. They are standing there trying to pick
a trade here and there, but they are not absorbing everything that is going on.
Right. Also, their expenses are usually way too high. They can't stand there and hack it long
enough to pick it up. Because it is like any job, if you stand there long enough, you have to pick it
up. It is just a matter of how long you can afford to stand there before you do.
Do you really believe that?
Well, the average guy might not be a million-dollar trader, but if he stands there for five years, he
would have to pick it up. It is just like a job. You don't start any job and feel comfortable in the first
six months.
You did.
Yes, but I did start as a one-lot trader. And I wasn't really comfortable, because I had to make
money. I only had $25,000 to my name.
At what point were you confident that you were going to be successful at it?
That is an interesting question. You are never really confident in this business, because you can
180



==================================================
                     PAGE 181                     
==================================================

always be wiped out pretty quickly. The way I trade is: Live by the sword, die by the sword. There
is always the potential that I could get caught with a big position in a fluke move with the market
going the limit against me. On the other hand, there is no doubt in my mind that I could walk into
any market in the world and make money.
What percentage of your days are losers?
One day out often.
Has that percentage changed over time?
That is over a long period of time.
From your perspective, what does the average trader—that is, public trader—do wrong?
They trade too much. They don't pick their spots selectively enough. When they see the market
moving, they want to be in on the action. So, they end up forcing the trade rather than waiting
patiently. Patience is an important trait many people don't have.
Waiting for the right spot?
Right, I bet most people are probably ahead after their first five trades. They think, "This is great,
like free money." But then they forget that the reason they made money on their early trades was
because they waited a long time. They said, "I bet this is a good spot to buy it because I've seen the
market act this way a lot of times." And they made money. But all of a sudden, they are doing a
trade every day.
The next thing that happens is they lose on a few trades, and invariably don't know how to take a
loss. They made money to start, and before they know it, they are even. Now they hesitate. "Where
do I get out?" The minute they hesitate, the market just keeps going. Now they are losing money
and they say, "If I sell it here, I'm going to lose $1,000." They don't like to lose $1,000, when
they're getting paid $500 a week. Now, all of a sudden, they are thinking about the money.
Once you think about the money, you are dead?
Yes. That is what usually happens to the public.
What is your own way of handling losses? Get out. Quickly?
If I can. My point is that I have a lot of patience and I wait. If I know it is a losing trade, I wait for
what I think is the optimum time to bail out. Then I try and reverse.
So, if you realize you don't like the trade anymore, you'll get out, but you'll pick your time?
Right, but I will get out.
Let's say you are doing that on a day when the market is a one-way street. At what point do
you just have to cough it up?
It depends how far it has gone against you. If it's against you a long way, at some point you just
throw it in. Those days happen maybe three or four times a year. You just start bailing out.
But you usually have a feel for when that is the thing to do?
Yes, because it has happened before.
But normally, if you are just a bit behind in a trade, you are better off if you let the market
move a little in your direction and try to sell on strength, or buy on weakness, instead of just
trying to dump it in a hurry?
Right.
Is that a key element to your trading style?
Yes. Never give up on a trade. Many traders who are in a losing trade will just get out because they
were taught that you have to have discipline. Great. Those traders will always be around. But if
they just had some patience and said, "Yes, it is going to be a losing trade, but instead of getting out
here at 7, maybe if I wait and just sweat it out for another minute, I can sell at 10."
Is it a matter of just wanting to get out to stop the pain? And if they were willing to stand the
pain a little longer, they would be better off. Is that a fair way of putting it?
Yes. They give up too quickly. In most cases, if you don't give up, you might be able to turn a five-
yard loss into a two-yard loss.

==================================================

Your trading size has obviously grown quite dramatically since you first got into the business.
Has that made it harder to trade?
Yes, you have to adapt. You need to change your method of buying and selling, because the market
is continually changing in subtle ways.
What changes have you seen in the bond market since you got in?
Well, you can trade bigger size. Now you can usually trade a couple of hundred at each tick. It
doesn't move the market as much.
How about a thousand lots?
It depends on the liquidity at the time. Lots of times you can get out. It is amazing how much
liquidity there is when you want to get out.
On average, if you had to dump a thousand, how much would that move the market?
Depending on the time of day and the liquidity, maybe 1 or 2 ticks.
Not much at all?
No, not much.
Has size been an impediment at all if the liquidity is that good?
Yes, it is harder. Generally, when you get into a big position, the rest of the floor knows about it
because they stood there and watched you. At least they think they know. They all put their hands
down and wait when they think you are wrong. It is natural for a trader to be skeptical.
I would almost think that because you have a long-term record of success, they would more
often coattail you.
Lots of times that is true, and that also makes it harder to get in and out. When you go to offer
them, they are all offering too.
How do you handle those situations?
You have to pick your spot. You have to wait for the big paper order to come in and then go for it.
Does it become like a chess game, where you sometimes want the pit thinking that you are
selling when you are really buying?
Yes, sometimes. But generally, you can't trade big size when you are doing that.
So, frequently, if you are long and want to liquidate, you just wait for the bid to come in?
Right.
What kinds of things do you look for in a chart?
Key points such as the high and low for the week, the halfway backpoint, and consolidation areas.
Do you use charts for short-term or long-term perspective?
Short term.
Short term in your case meaning?
I guess as short as possible. You get in a trade, make money as fast as possible, and minimize your
risk.
I've noticed that a lot of times, bonds will take out one- and two-week highs or lows by a few
ticks and then pull back. The price action almost seems like a trap for the breakout players.
Is that a pattern in the bond market?
Yes. It always has been.
Do you use fundamentals?
Whenever any important fundamental numbers come out, I use them.
Do you use the fundamentals indirectly, that is, by seeing how the market responds to the new
information?
Yes, but also by being the first one to trade off the new fundamental information. I know what I am
going to do if a number comes out one way or the other, and I usually have the opportunity to be
first.

==================================================

You want to get there before the crowd does. Are you normally right on that type of trade?
Yes.
You've done tens of thousands of trades. Does any single trade stand out as particularly
emotional?
The first 100-lot I did. It was a milestone.
What kind of jump was that for you?
You tend to go from one lot to five lots to ten lots to twenty lots to fifty lots.
So, you probably went from 50 to 100? Do you remember that trade?
Yes, it was a much bigger risk. The market was trading at 64.25 and a broker bid 25 for 100 lots.
But he didn't put a size on it, he just bid 25. So I said, "Sold." He thought I was being funny and
said, "I'll buy the 100," knowing I had never traded that big before. So I said, "Well, I'll sell you
100." The market went to 24 offered instantly.
It almost sounds like you did your first 100-lot as a dare?
Well, almost. But I wasn't a very good trader then. I immediately bought ten, then ten more. I was
trying to bid at 23, and the market went to 22 offered. By the time I got out, I had ten different
people in the trade, because I didn't know how to cover 100 lots.
But the trade worked out for you?
Oh yes. Well, actually, the word got out that this small trader had done a 100-lot. So I had to go up
to the office to talk to the clearing firm after the close.
How long had you been trading at that time?
Six months.
That was pretty early on. I assume your capitalization was really inadequate to handle 100
lots?
Right. I had probably made $100,000 by then. Maybe not even that.
Even at $100,000, that wouldn't cover you for much of a move.
Yes, only 1 point. [In bonds, 1 point equals 32 ticks (the smallest price movement).] I told them,
"Look, I just thought it was a great trade at the time, and I'll probably never do it again."
How long was it before you traded 100 lots again?
Two days.
You just never thought about the risk side of it?
No, if a guy bids 25 for 100, and I think that it is a great trade, I just say "Sold."
Is there any element in your mindset as a trader that says: I had better be careful that I'm
always in the game?
That came later.
Are you always in control, or are there days when you have lost control?
There were days when I've lost control.
Any that stand out?
A couple. You have to say that about any day you lose a couple of million dollars.
Were those days one-way street markets?
Yes, one-way streets. Because I'm a market maker, I take the other side of the trend. So, if the
market goes one way for 50 ticks, I can guarantee you I'm going the wrong way, and at some point,
it is going to be a loss.
What was your position at the October 1987 low in bonds?
I was long.
When did you start getting long?
Five points higher.

==================================================

Five full points! You mean 81?
Yes. The day it broke below 77,1 was long thousands of contracts. Other traders were also heavily
long.
That was the day we gapped sharply lower. Who was selling?
The commercials just kept selling.
Did you have second thoughts?
Yes.
Did you think if the market went down to 76, maybe it could go to 70?
No. At that point, you had to say it was all over and done.
Why?
Technical analysis and experience.
Was that an example of your being patient in picking your spot to get out, even when the
initial trade was wrong?
Right.
Do you ever use any trading systems for anything?
No. They wouldn't be there if they weren't wrong.
Do you think trading systems are a losing game? Sure. Why do they exist?
You tell me. Because people aren't confident in their own ability. If you had a really good trading
system, you could make millions. Why would you sell it for $29.95?
Does luck have anything to do with trading?
Trading is like any other job. You work hard, put in the time and effort, and make your own luck. I
was lucky that the first 100-lot I sold was a winner. But why was I lucky? Because I stood there all
day for over six months, developing and honing market feeling. When the opportunity occurred, I
didn't hesitate.
You have to pay your dues to get the luck.
Right.
Are there people on the floor who are not good traders, but are way ahead because they just
happened to do a couple of big trades on the right side of the market? Can anybody really get
by just on luck?
No, not for long. The rule of thumb is if you have lasted a year, you will make it, but it is hard.
Are there traders that you are influenced by because you respect what they are doing?
Oh, yes. They are indicators.
So, that is actually part of your trading approach. For example, if trader X is a good trader,
and he is on a roll, and you are thinking of selling— And he does, then you know you're right.
But if he is buying?
Then you hesitate. Maybe you don't get into the trade.
Are there traders who can't succeed because their ego is too big to ever be influenced?
Yes.
Is part of the success a willingness to not always do your own thing?
Right. You have to adapt to your success. If you make a lot of money, all of a sudden you start to
think you are infallible. You forget the reason you were right was because of all those little factors
that you followed. As soon as you think, "I'm the guy who is going to lead the way," you get
slammed.
So, it really doesn't make a difference whether it is your idea or somebody else's. Winning or
losing is all that counts. Where the idea came from isn't important?
Right.
Do you have to be somewhat of an egomaniac to be a good trader?

Actually, the best traders have no ego. To be a great trader, you have to have a big enough ego only
in the sense that you have confidence in yourself. You cannot let ego get in the way of a trade that
is a loser; you have to swallow your pride and get out.
After you get way ahead, is there a temptation to say, the extra money doesn't mean anything
anymore, maybe I should cash in the chips?
I never thought that way. Obviously, when I started, I needed to make money to support my family,
but I never had a goal to make a million dollars. I said, "Hey, this is great, maybe I can make
$100,000."
You passed that a very long time ago. Do you have any other goals?
No.
You just do what you do because you enjoy it?
Yes. And I hope it lasts.
Baldwin's incredible trading achievements made him an ideal interview candidate for this book.
However, I did not really expect his comments to be pertinent to myself or other off-the-floor
traders. After all, what could a floor trader, whose time horizon is measured in minutes and
seconds, say that was relevant to traders who hold positions for weeks or months?
To my surprise, the interview yielded some relevant insights. Perhaps the most important point
made by Baldwin was his emphasis on not viewing trading in terms of money. To him, money is
only a means of keeping score. By contrast, most traders tend to think of gains and losses in terms
of their monetary implications—a frame of mind that only gets in the way of making trading
decisions.
For example, assume you originally planned to risk up to $5,000 on a trade, and quickly find
yourself down by $2,000. If, at this point, you start to think of the trade in terms of money (for
example, "the extra $3,000 can pay for my vacation"), you might well liquidate the position, even
though you still believed in the trade. It is one thing to get out because you no longer like the
position, but it is quite another matter to liquidate on impulse simply because you have translated
the risk into tangible terms.
Another interesting point made by Baldwin is an unconventional one: Don't get out of a losing
trade too hastily; instead, wait and choose your time. This advice seems to fly in the face of most
trading advice. After all, isn't one of the basic tenets of trading success to cut your losses quickly?
However, I don't think Baldwin's statement contradicts the rule. I believe he is saying that often the
worst time to bail out of a position is during a violent price move against you. Baldwin's point is
that by bearing the pain just a little longer, you may be able to find a more favorable circumstance
for liquidating. Of course, this philosophy should be applied only by disciplined traders: those with
the ability to maintain a risk control strategy.

Tony Saliba-"One-Lot" Triumphs*
Tony Saliba came to the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1978. After a half-year of
clerking, Saliba was ready to try it on his own. He found another trader to back him for $50,000,
and after a favorable start, nearly self-destructed. He pulled back from the brink of disaster by
altering his trading techniques, and has been successful ever since.
Saliba's trading style can be described as trying to do a little better than treading water day in, day
out, while being positioned to take advantage of the rare spectacular trading opportunity. His
fortune has been built largely by exploiting only a handful of such events. Two of these
situations—the Teledyne price explosion and the October 1987 stock market collapse—are
discussed in the interview.
The impressive aspect of Saliba's trading achievements is not the few spectacular gains he has
registered in his career. Rather, it is that these gains have been achieved by using a trading
approach exemplified by incredible risk control. In fact, at one point, Saliba managed to string
together seventy consecutive months of profits exceeding $100,000. Quite a few traders have
become multimillionaires by scoring several big hits. A much smaller number have managed to
hold on to their gains. Only the rare trader can boast both occasional dramatic gains and consistent
trading profits.
*Readers unfamiliar with options may wish to first read Appendix 2 in order to understand the
trading-related reierences in this chapter.
Although the homework required for Saliba's successful trading is extensive, he has nonetheless
managed to diversify into a wide range of other ventures, including real estate investments, a
software company, and a restaurant chain. Overall, his extracurricular business endeavors have
proven only modestly profitable, but they have indulged his appetite for variety.
During the time these interviews were being conducted, Saliba was involved in the most important
business venture of his life: negotiating with a French bank to back him with several hundred
million dollars to form a major trading company. His goal is to discover and train a generation of
successful traders.
Saliba is a likable person who makes you feel like you're one of his best friends within five minutes
of meeting. He is a person who genuinely likes people—and it shows.
On the evening before our scheduled meeting, Saliba had a minor accident, slipping on the marble
floor at the health club in the Chicago Board Options Exchange building. As I showed up at the
scheduled time, his aide told me that Tony would not be in that morning due to the accident. I left a
message. Saliba called later that day, and to spare me the inconvenience of missing my flight that
evening, or making another trip to Chicago, he arranged to meet me several hours later.
We talked at the LaSalle Club bar, which was sufficiently empty to not cause a major distraction.
Initially, I was too intensely focused on directing the interview to pay any attention at all to the
largemovie screen at the front of the bar. Later on, however, as I relaxed, I glanced at the screen as
Saliba was answering one of my questions. I instantly recognized the train scene from the movie
Risky Business in which the sensuous Rebecca DeMornay seduces Tom Cruise.
I have a bad habit of severely overscheduling my appointments, and as Saliba was my third
interview of the day, I was beginning to feel the strain. My first thought was, "Keep your eyes off
the screen, you are having a hard enough time keeping your mind focused as it is." My second
thought was, "It would be incredibly rude not to pay full attention to Tony, especially after he
literally hobbled over to spare me the inconvenience of having to reschedule our interview." My
third thought was, "Thank God I'm the one facing the screen."
What led you to become a trader?
I was a caddy for some grain traders when I was in high school. In college, a friend of mine asked
me if I would like to be a broker. I thought that he meant doing the same thing as the guys I had
caddied for. So, I said, "Yes. Great! Where?" "Indianapolis," he answered. I said, "What exchange
is in Indianapolis?" "None," he said, "you do it on the phone." I had this impression of: "Hello New
York, buy; Chicago, sell." When I got there, I found out I was a salesman.
After a few months, I asked the guys in the office, "Who makes all the money in this business?"
They said you have to be on the floor. Right there I decided to go to the Chicago Board Options

                     PAGE 187                     
==================================================

Exchange. On the floor, I met one of the traders I had caddied for years ago, and he grubstaked me
with $50,000.
Isn't that unusual, giving $50,000 to a kid who used to caddy for you?
It was, except that he was very wealthy and needed to get off the floor because of his high blood
pressure. He owned a seat that he had bought for only $10,000, and just needed the ability to trade
in a customer account. I was going to help him do that.
What made him think you could make it as a trader?
He had heard some rumors around the floor that I was a hotshot clerk, and he basically took a
chance on me.
What happened?
I went from $50,000 to about $75,000 in the first two weeks. I had put on all these volatility
spreads [an option position that will gain if the market becomes more volatile] and they were
getting pumped up.
Did you think, "Boy, this is easy"?
I thought, "This is it!" I mean, I was a genius. But what I was really doing was taking the opposite
side of positions the other brokers were liquidating, letting them out of the market with their profits,
while I was left holding the bag. This was spring 1979 and implied volatilities were very high
because 1978 was a very volatile year. Well, the market went nowhere, and the volatility and
option premiums collapsed. Within six weeks I had lost almost everything. The original $50,000
was down to only about $15,000.1 was feeling suicidal. Do you remember the big DC10 crash at
O'Hare in May 1979, when all those people died? That was when I hit bottom.
Was that a metaphor for your mood?
Yes. I would have exchanged places with one of those people in that plane on that day. I felt that
bad. I thought, "This is it; I've mined my life."
Did you feel guilty because you had lost someone else's money?
Yes, and I felt like a failure.
Had you started out confident?
Initially, I was very confident because before I started trading on my own, I had clerked for a
broker for four months and picked his brain clean.
And now you thought the game was over?
Yes. In June 1979,1 decided that I better find another job. I went to the Levy brothers, who owned
a chain of restaurants that my dad built for them. They said, "Any time you want a job, you can run
one of our restaurants." So, I said, "Hold that line. I am going to give it one more month,"
Did you feel better because you had a cushion?
Yes. I said, "This is great, I've still got fifteen grand in my account."
You had a stop on your life so to speak?
Exactly, exactly. I had a stop on my career. So, I decided to go back and give it one more shot.
Did the fellow who staked you know how much you had lost? Did he ever say anything?
Oh, good question, Jack. He called me every night. I' ve grubstaked many guys since then, and
three or four of them have lost more than fifty grand each. This man was a multimillionaire, and he
acted as if this was the end of the world.
Did he ever ask you for the rest of the money back?
No, he just moaned and groaned. He had become wealthy through inheritance and money he made
in another business. He really didn't know much about option trading. He had bought the seat to
have something to do with his life. He told me, "If you lose $5,000 more, we'll pull the plug." So, I
spent the next few weeks winding down my positions.
During that time, I sought advice from the more experienced brokers on the floor. They said, "You
have to be disciplined and you have to do your homework. If you do those two things, you can
make money down here. You might not get rich, but you can make $300 a day, and at the end of

                     PAGE 188                     
==================================================

the year that's $75,000. You have to look at it that way." It was like a light bulb went on. I realized
that this chipping away approach was what I should be doing, not putting myself at a big risk,
trying to collect a ton of dough.
At the time I was in Teledyne options, which was a very volatile market. So, I switched to Boeing,
which was a very tight, narrow range type of market. I became a spread scalper trying to make a
quarter or an eighth of a point on a trade.
I stuck strictly to my goal of trying to average $300 a day and it was working. This period taught
me to be regimented and disciplined.
То this day, I live by the credo of hard work, homework, and discipline. I teach my guys that.
Anyway, at this same time, I still had the remnants of a big spread position in Teledyne that I was
in the process of liquidating. It was a position that would lose in a rising market. One day after I
had been trading Boeing for about five weeks, Teledyne started moving up sharply. I was not going
to let it get me again. I rushed into the Teledyne pit to take my position off. I was hearing floor
brokers come in with orders, and all of a sudden I found myself responding to them. I was adapting
the same technique I had learned in Boeing to Teledyne, except instead of scalping for an eighth or
a quarter, I was scalping for halves and dollars.
What size were you trading at the time?
I was doing one lot at a time. The guys didn't like me because I was getting in their way. They
wanted to do ten- or twenty-lot orders.
In other words, you were just a nuisance.
Exactly.
How did you get someone to take one lot?
On the options floor, it's first come, first served. If you have 100 to sell and someone bids first for
just one, you have to do his one before you do 99 with the number two guy. The broker could
ignore you if he wants, but if he does, he's breaking the rules.
Were you ignored?
The brokers never did, but the market makers on the floor did.
By brokers, you mean order fillers?
Yes. The floor brokers are the order fillers, and the market makers are the locals who trade for
themselves. On the options exchange, the two are separate.
Were you the only one-lot trader in Teledyne?
For the most part, yes.
Did you take a lot of ribbing?
Oh, did I! They called me "one-lot" for the longest time. The individual who gave me the hardest
time was the best trader in the crowd. He had made millions and was virtually a legend in his own
time. He started leaning on me and ribbing me right from the beginning. He made my life
miserable.
Did your ego get dented by these really successful traders railing you?
Oh, yes. And, it went on for almost a year, day in, day out.
W`re you tempted to pick up your trading a little bit?
I did, but not for that reason. My backer, who had given me such a hard time when I was down,
was the prod. Although he didn't know that much about trading, he did give me one piece of very
useful advice. Once I started turning it around, he told me to increase my size. He said, "Tony, a
banker makes his first loan and he is very careful, but as he gets more comfortable, he makes his
loans bigger. You need to increase your size."
How did the harassment you were taking on the floor finally end?
When they introduced puts in June 1980, the lead trader, who had given me the hardest time, hated
them. He said they were bad for the business and he didn't want to trade them. I seized that
opportunity to really study what puts would mean to us, and I was one of the first market makers to
start trading puts.

==================================================
                     PAGE 189                     
==================================================

Actually, it opens up a whole range of new strategies.
Oh, unbelievable. These other guys were set in their ways, even though they had only been there a
couple of years. Sooner than you might think, this nmnber one trader befriended me and suggested
that we work together. We started working on advanced strategies, getting real creative and
abstract.
Were you working these out on a computer?
No, we did everything by hand. Writing out all these "what-ifs."
Didn't you still have to be guessing right on price and volatility direction?
You would have to guess right on volatility. However, we didn't have to peg market direction,
because we were setting up spreads that had a big edge. For example, one option might be highly
overvalued because it was popular among the member firms.
Eventually, I felt I was doing more of the work, while this top trader in the pit was counting on his
ability to muscle the market. He would also stray from the strategies we had worked out and even
started doing things to try to hurt me. I would say, "What are you doing?" He would just answer, "I
changed my mind."
Finally, I just said, "Forget it, I'm working on my own." I started taking on more size. When
interest rates went through the roof in 1981 and early 1982, my strategies worked really well and I
started making a lot of money. Then in the bull market in 1982,1 had days when I was making
$200,000 a day. The guys in my clearinghouse couldn't believe the sheets; there was just tons of
paper.
What kind of trades were you doing?
I was doing everything. I consider myself a matrix trader. I trade everything on the screen as it
interrelates to everything else. My basic strategy, however, was buying butterflies [a long or short
position at one strike price balanced by an opposite position in higher and lower strike options—for
example, long one IBM 135 call, short two IBM 140 calls, and long one IBM 145 call] and
offsetting that with an explosion position.
By buying butterflies, do you mean you were long the middle or long the wings [that is, the
higher and lower strike price options]?
Long the wings. Your risk is limited, and if the market does not move widely, time decay works in
your favor. [Barring a favorable price move or an increase in volatility, the value of an option
erodes steadily over time. In a relatively flat market, the premium erosion in options with a strike
price near the market price—"middle" in butterfly spread—will be greater than that of options
further removed from the strike price— "wings" in spread.] Of course, I tried to buy the butterflies
as cheap as I could. If I chained enough of them together, my profit zone would be fairly wide.
Then I would do an explosion position in a more distant month.
What do you mean by the term "explosion position"?
That's basically my own term. An explosion position is an option position that has limited risk and
open-ended potential, which will profit from a large price move or an increase in volatility. For
example, a position consisting of long out-of-the-money calls and long out-of-the-money puts
would be an explosion position.
It sounds like the basic unifying feature of the explosion position is that as the market moves,
the delta [the expected price change in the option position given a one-unit change in the price
of the underlying market] increases in your favor. So, you are really betting on volatility.
Exactly.
In effect, this is the opposite of what you do with the butterfly.
Yes. I put on the butterfly in the front month, where time is working for me, and the explosion
position in the mid- or back-month. Then I complement that with scalping to help pay for the time
decay in the explosion position.
In other words, the explosion position is your money bet in case of a big move, while your
scalping is paying the bills, that is, the time decay cost of the explosion position.
Exactly.

                     PAGE 190                     
==================================================

Were you always offsetting one position with another? In other words, were you always delta
neutrafl [An option position in which total equity will remain roughly unchanged for small
price changes in either direction.]
Usually, but once in a while I would take a significant net position.
What was your first really big trade?
Teledyne in 1984. The stock had dropped sharply and I was building up a position in the out-of-the-
money October calls. Well, the stock started inching back up, but these guys from the Pacific Coast
Exchange, where they also list Teledyne, were leaning on my longs. They just kept battering them
on the close every night. Instead of shying away, I stepped up and would buy them. "You want to
sell them at ГА, I'm 1'л bid for fifty." This went on for over ten trading days.
Why were these Pacific Coast traders leaning on the calls?
The stock had gone down from 160 to 138, and then inched its way back up to 150.1 guess they
didn't think it was going to go up anymore. On May 9 at 9:20 they stopped trading in Teledyne
because of news pending. The news comes across the tape: "Teledyne Announces a Stock
Repurchase Program at $200 per Share."
Buying back their own stock?
Yes. The stock was at $155, and I owned the $180 calls. Overnight, I made millions. The stock
eventually went up to $300. The next four to five months were great.
What happened after that?
One of my goals in life was to become a millionaire before I was thirty and retire. Well, I was a
millionaire before I was twenty-five. I had decided to retire when I was thirty. On May 5, 1985, my
thirtieth birthday, I walked off the floor and said good-bye to everybody and that was it. I was
never going to come back to the floor.
How far were you up then?
About $8-9 million.
Did you know what you were going to do?
I didn't really know. I thought I'd stay in the business somehow, but work off the floor.
How long did your retirement last?
About four months.
Were you bored?
Yes. I missed the markets. I missed the excitement.
So, in the beginning, money was the goal, but once you got there it became.
Yes, it became secondary. Maybe if I had a wife and kids, or someone special in my life, I might
not have gone back. But trading was my life. It made me feel like something; it gave me a reason
for being.
I understand one of your best trading periods was the week of the October 1987 stock crash.
Tell me about it.
I was expecting a big move, but I didn't know if it would be up or down. So, I started building the
same type position that I had in Teledyne.
The butterfly spread combined with the explosion position.
Yes.
What was the explosion position in this case?
In this case, it was formed by buying out-of-the-money puts and out-of-the-money calls in the back
months. To counterbalance this position, I had butterfly spreads in the front month, which would
profit from time decay.
What told you the market was going to have a big move?
You could feel it in the wild gyrations that were occurring by late September.
Did you expect the move to be on the downside by that time?

Actually, I thought it was going to be on the upside. At first, I thought we were going to attack the
old highs again.
When did you change your mind?
On Wednesday of the week before the crash, the market fell apart. Thursday, it didn't bounce back,
but kind of churned. Now, if it had rallied on Friday, then I would have been confused. But instead,
the market cracked on Friday. At that point, I was sure we were going down.
Because it was the end of the week?
Yes, and there is a high correlation between the action on a Friday and the follow-through on the
next Moniday—at least on the opening.
Did you have any inkling of the siize of the impending move on the following Monday?
Do you know what I really thought was going to happen Monday? I thought the market would open
lower, go down sharply, and then bounce back to about unchanged. I actually bought out-of-the-
money calls that Friday for protection.
But you said you thought the market was going down?
Yes, but I just wanted to have some insurance. A trader once told me, "Saliba, in stealing second,
you never take your hand off first until your other hand is on second." That's the way I am; I always
have insurance.
Still, you must have been awfully confident that the market was going sharply lower on
Monday morning. According to the cover story in Success magazine [April 1988], it sounds
like you knew the market would collapse. It says you even deliberately chose to go to the
office instead of the floor to avoid being influenced out of your position by all the confusion
on the floor. Isn't that highly unusual for you to go to the office instead of the floor on a
trading day?
Yes, if I'm trading, I'm on the floor. But that article is completely misleading. They wrote it that
way to sell magazines. They make it sound like I planned and plotted to avoid the floor that day.
That's not the story. I was concerned about the positions held by my clearing firm. One guy in
particular had a huge position, which he wasn't closing, and I had to spend a great deal of time on
the phone. Now, that's not as dramatic as the way the magazine wrote it up, but that's what really
happened.
Didn't you also sell your seat that day? You must have been really confident the market was
going down to sell a seat.
I hit that seat before the market opened. I figured if I didn't hit the bid for the seat, someone else
would. Anyway I had seven seats; I just sold one.
Was this the first time you traded a seat? I mean seats aren't exactly a liquid market.
Yes, it was the first time I did it like that: trading the seat round turn in one day. But I have traded
seats before. I trade them depending on my mood in the market. On balance though, I want to be
long seats. I believe in our industry.
But in that circumstance, it did seem like a good trade?
I figured, "Hey, I have a lot of exposure in seats—a few million dollars worth—I better take some
protection." I sold that seat for $452,000 in the morning and bought it back the next afternoon for
$275,000.
How much did you make that Monday?
That has caused me a lot of headaches. I would rather not say.
Obviously, your big money was made in the out-of-the-money puts. What percentage of that
position did you keep as of Monday's close?
About 95 percent.
You kept most of it! But the profits were so huge. Wasn't it tempting to just take it?
The reason I didn't cover was because I felt my long puts hadn't gone up enough. They all went to
parity. The puts that were thirty points in-the-money were trading at $30. In other words, the option

==================================================

premiums consisted almost entirely of intrinsic value; the market wasn't giving them any time value
premium. Given the enormous market volatility, I thought that was crazy.
So, you figured you would wait till the next day.
Yes, and do you know what I did to hedge myself? I bought more insurance at the close on
Monday. I covered hundreds of my short calls.
You were basically buying more volatility.
It was the best thing I could have done. The next day they didn't know what they wanted more of:
Half the world wanted puts, and half the world wanted calls.
But everybody wanted volatility.
That's when the register really started ringing. It was the day that the sun was so close to the earth
that everybody needed zinc ointment, and I was the only guy that had some left.
Let's take the other side of the fence: What did the traders who got buried in October do
wrong?
They took for granted that Monday would be a normal day. They started out long, thinking the
market was just correcting and was due for a bounce. Then they bought on the way down; they
bought every dip.
Did some traders just freeze?
Sure, some did. I have one friend, who is a million-dollar annual earner. On Tuesday morning, I
walk in and say, "Hey, Jack, what do you think? Are you going to get them today?" But he just
stood there. He didn't say a word to me. He looked shell shocked. He just kept going over his
sheets, looking for something to do, but not knowing what to do. So he missed all the opportunity.
Why was the way you responded to the market so different from the way your friend
responded?
He wasn't sure what his position risk was. I always define my risk, and I don't have to worry about
it. I walk into the pit every day with a clean slate, so that I can take advantage of what is going on.
A clean slate sounds like you come in with a flat position every day, but you obviously hold
positions overnight.
I mean that I'm always hedged, and I'm always prepared.
Do you always know the maximum risk in a position that you hold? Do you always know
what your worst case is?
Yes. Now, what could happen? The market sits, it explodes, or something in between. But no
matter what happens, I know my worst case. My loss is always limited.
Why do so many traders who come to the floor end up losing everything?
I think the biggest problem with some traders that come on the floor is that they think they are
bigger than the market. They don't fear the marketplace, and they lose sight of their discipline and
the hard work ethic. Those are the traders who get blown out. But most guys on the floor really
work hard.
What is the biggest misconception the public has about the marketplace?
The idea that the market has to go up for them to make money. You can make money in any kind of
market if you use the right strategies. With futures, options, and the underlying markets, there are
enough tools available to set up a game plan for any situation.
In other words, the public has too much of a bullish bias?
Yes, it is the American way: The market has to go up. The government never said anything about
program trading when we were in a three-year bull market. Once the market started going down, all
of a sudden, program trading became a major concern, and they set up commissions galore.
For the average person, like my mom or dad and their relatives, the biggest misconception is that
they think when the market goes up, you make money, and when it goes down, you lose. People
need to approach it from a more neutral standpoint and say, "I'm going to be a little long in this
category and short in this category, but limit my short-side risk because it is infinite."

==================================================

How do you handle a losing period?
How do you lose money? It is either bad day trading or a losing position. If it's a bad position that
is the problem, then you should just get out of it.
Is that what you do?
Yes. I either liquidate it or neutralize it, because then you are back afloat. When you are in a boat
that springs a leak, you don't drill another hole to let the water out.
What if your trading losses are due to your making bad decisions? What do you do then?
Take a day off. If I get myself all wound up, I like to lay out in the sun and bake for a while and let
all the strenuous stuff go out of my head.
What are the elements of good trading?
Clear thinking, ability to stay focused, and extreme discipline. Discipline is number one: Take a
theory and stick with it. But you also have to be open-minded enough to switch tracks if you feel
that your theory has been proven wrong. You have to be able to say, "My method worked for this
type of market, but we are not in that type of market anymore."
Trading rules you live by.
I scale in and scale out of my positions, so that I can spread out my risk. I don't like to do all of a
large order right up front.
What else?
Always respect the marketplace. Never take anything for granted. Do your homework. Recap the
day. Figure out what you did right and what you did wrong. That is one part of the homework; the
other part is projec-tive. What do I want to happen tomorrow? What happens if the opposite
occurs? What happens if nothing happens? Think through all the "what-ifs." Anticipate and plan,
rather than react.
When you made your first few million, did you sock some of it away to limit your worst case
possibility?
No. My trading strategies were growing and I needed new capital. Then after I made some more, I
started putting money into other investments: real estate, stores, exchange seats, and things like
that. Then when the market crashed I hate to use that term on Monday, October 19,1 realized that I
didn't have a big chunk of cash anywhere, so I took a couple of million dollars out of the flow and
bought T-bills. Then, a few weeks later, I used the money to buy an annuity.
I guess because your trading style is so focused on limiting losses, the first time you felt the
need for a safety net was when the market seemed to be saying that a catastrophe could occur
and have nothing to do with you.
Yes. What happens if you have $10 million in your trading account, but they shut down the game?
How do you set goals?
Until recently, I set goals on a monetary level. First, I wanted to become a millionaire before I was
thirty. I did it before I was twenty-five. Then I decided I wanted to make so much a year, and I did
that. Originally, the goals were all numbers, but the numbers aren't so important anymore. Now, I
want to do some things that are not only profitable, but will also be fun. For example, I'm currently
working on setting up a trading company and a software company. I also want to do the family-type
thing.
How do you judge success?
I used to judge success as being the best in your field, like Bruce Springsteen in rock music. In my
industry, it would have to be dollar-wise. Now, I think it is more quality of life. A lot of people
think I'm a success, but I don't feel like I'm a success. I really don't. I feel like I've made a lot of
money, and I've been successful at this one area in my life. I help the needy, but I don't have that
family fulfillment. How do you judge success? I don't know. All I know is that all the money in the
world isn't the answer.
You thought it was at one time.
Yes I did. And to be honest, money is important because it is influential. See that guy standing over

there? I don't know him from Adam. But say he came over to talk to us. If he made a really bad
first impression on me, I might not have much respect for him. But if you then told me that guy is
worth $50 million, and he made it on his own, that would completely change my opinion of him.
That may not be fair, but that's the way it is.
How does trading affect your personal life?
I'm able to handle it well from a business standpoint, but from a social standpoint it clobbers me. It
doesn't allow me to give the time to women and friends that they require. People like to just sit and
talk sometimes. Unless it is about business, like this with you, I'm out of here.
Are you always that conscious of time?
Yes. Most people aren't. They say, "Well, don't you ever just sit home and watch TV?"
Do you?
Well, I might have the TV on, but my head is always on trading. Last night I came back from a
dinner date at midnight. I was tired and wanted to go to bed, but I was up until 2:00 A.M. figuring
out trades. It's an addiction. I used to be much worse. I got lots of grief from former girlfriends
because I would take my work with me on dates. I don't do that any more, but I'm always still
thinking about trading.
What makes you different?
I think I can do anything, and I'm not afraid of hard work. Right now, for example, I'm working on
a deal with a French bank to put together a trading company. I can't wait until this venture starts up,
so that I can start working with these kids, training them to be traders. I don't know exactly how
much the bank is going to give me, but I could have hundreds of millions to work with. I love that
type of challenge.
It is important to realize that many of the great traders interviewed in this book were not
immediately successful. Saliba's initial trading experience was so disastrous that it brought him to a
near suicidal state of mind. However, what these traders share is a sense of self-confidence and
persistence. In the case of early failure, these traits are enough to lead to eventual success. Besides
allowing him to make a comeback from his early poor start, Saliba's persistence also came into play
at other points in his trading career. For example, many others faced with the type of constant
ridicule that Saliba was subjected to in the Teledyne pit might have abandoned their strategy.
This same Teledyne example also illustrates another important characteristic of the superior trader:
the maintenance of rigid risk control, even in difficult circumstances. It must have been very
tempting for Saliba to trade a larger position size in the Teledyne pit when he was being derided as
"one-lot." Instead, he maintained his discipline and continued to trade small until his capital had
grown sufficiently to allow him to increase his position size.
Working hard and examining many different scenarios so that he is prepared for all contingencies is
a critical element of Saliba's success. By anticipating all the "what-ifs," he can take advantage of
situations such as the October 19 stock slide, instead of being immobilized by such events. For
many people, the concept of a great trader conjures up an image of someone using a shoot-from-
the-hip approach, moving in and out of markets with great agility and a near sixth sense. The reality
is far less glamorous. In the majority of cases, exceptional traders owe their success to hard work
and preparation. In fact, similar to Tony Saliba, many of the very successful traders will do their
"homework" every night, not allowing leisure or other business from interfering with their daily
regimen of market analysis. When they stray from that discipline, it usually ends up costing them
money. In Saliba's own words, referring to a recently missed trade due to his failure to have his
orders in while on a business trip, "It cost me ten grand, and all those little ten grands can add up."

Dr. Van K. Tharp-The Psychology of Trading
Dr. Van K. Tharp is a research psychologist who received his Ph.D. from the University of
Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, in 1975. He has spent his career studying how stress affects
human performance. His strongest interest is in the psychology of winning—especially as winning
applies to the markets. In 1982, Dr. Tharp developed his Investment Psychology Inventory, a test
that measures winning and losing traits. Thousands of investors and speculators—myself
included—have taken this test, which includes a written evaluation and a ten-minute phone
consultation. Dr. Tharp has written five books on successful investing which provide the core of his
investment course. He is a contributing editor for Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities
and has also written numerous articles for other financial publications. Dr. Tharp is a frequent guest
on financial television and radio programs, and has spoken at many investment conferences.
Dr. Tharp currently devotes himself full time to counseling traders from his office in Glendale,
California, and continuing his research on trading success. A recent focus of this research has been
interviewing and studying top traders so that he could create a model for success. His basic theory
is that by teaching the winning traits of the top traders (not specific trading methodologies), he can
dramatically improve the performance of less successful traders and investors. In his most recent
project, he is attempting to turn his most successful clients into "supertraders" by extending his
normal program of two two-day sessions into an ongoing semiannual process.
After I interviewed Dr. Tharp, he asked whether he could do a video tape interview of me as part of
his ongoing research. Since I thought such an interview might be helpful in improving my own
trading performance, I eagerly agreed. The interview lasted for over four hours. Dr. Tharp has a
particularly probing questioning style. After an initial response to a question, he would ask, "What
else?" and repeat this process several times. When I could no longer think of any additional
responses, he would have me shift the direction of my gaze (he later explained this instruction was
intended to facilitate accessing different parts of my brain), and sure enough I would think of
another point I had somehow overlooked. I felt that this interview yielded some important personal
insights. (One of these self-realizations is briefly discussed in the next chapter.)
I would have liked to provide my personal impression of Dr. Tharp's basic course, which includes
five books and four tapes. However, although I reviewed the material briefly as background for this
chapter, the combination of simultaneously working at a full-time job and writing this book did not
leave me with enough time (or energy) to give the course the serious attention it calls for—a
personal project I plan for later. I can, however, attest to the fact that one of the traders interviewed
in this book served as a subject in Dr. Tharp's project on modeling success and was duly impressed
with his intellect and insight into successful trading.
How did you first get interested in the connection between psychology and trading?
My primary research interest after graduate school was how various drugs affect human
performance. After receiving my Ph.D. in psychology, I spent about eight years doing fairly
standard psychological research. For example, I helped standardize the current Field Sobriety Test
Battery that police throughout the country are still using. While I was doing that, I also learned how
to lose money trading options. In fact, I lost money so fast and so consistently that when I finally
got out of the market, I had to conclude that the losses had something to do with me. During that
same time period, I enrolled in a class in prosperity at the local Church of Religious Science. One
of the principles taught in that class is that what happens to you reflects your mindset. I had read a
lot on the psychology of trading, and while I considered most of that information to be "folklore," I
wanted to test it out. I decided to do so by developing my Investment Psychology Inventory, a test
to measure investment strengths and weaknesses, as a creative project for that class. No one in the
class would take it, so I sent it to R. E. McMaster, the editor of a newsletter to which I was
subscribing. McMaster took it and then offered it to his subscribers. Overall, I received close to a
thousand responses and that really roused my interest in this area as a career.
What did you learn in analyzing the responses to your test? Were there any major surprises?
I had several measures of success built into the test, so I could rank the responses according to
"success level." The investment literature suggested ten different areas that might be important. As
196



==================================================
                     PAGE 197                     
==================================================

a result, I designed questions to measure each of those areas. I did a number of statistical analyses
of the data and found a significant correlation between each area and investment success. In
addition, I found that those ten areas could be grouped into three major clusters, which I label the
psychological factor, the management and discipline factor, and the decision-making factor.
Although I've since refined the test, I still use the same three major clusters. In addition, I still keep
the ten original areas, and I've added an extra one—intuition.
What are the eleven areas you measure?
Well, the psychological factor has five areas. These include a well-rounded personal life, a positive
attitude, the motivation to make money, lack of conflict, and responsibility for results. Motivation
to make money is not significantly correlated with success, but I keep it in the test because lack of
such motivation plus high conflict is very significant.
There are three factors in the decision-making area. These include a solid knowledge of technical
factors in the market, an aptitude for making sound decisions without common biases, and the
ability to think independently. Incidentally, knowledge of technical factors has little relationship to
success based on the test scores.
Also, there are three management-discipline factors. One needs risk control and the ability to be
patient, hi addition, I also include intuition in this category. Although I have not found any
relationship between intuition and trading success, I keep the factor in the test because it is in-
teresting to me.
Given those areas, what are the characteristics of the losing trader?
The composite profile of a losing trader would be someone who is highly stressed and has little
protection from stress, has a negative outlook on life and expects the worst, has a lot of conflict in
his/her personality, and blames others when things go wrong. Such a person would not have a set of
rales to guide their behavior and would be more likely to be a crowd follower, hi addition, losing
traders tend to be disorganized and impatient. They want action now. Most losing traders are not as
bad as the composite profile would suggest. They just have part of the losing profile.
You now consult with many traders. How did you get started in that?
After I started using the test regularly, people began to ask me what to do about their particular
problems. Since investment psychology is a rather unique area of study, I found I didn't know how
to respond to many of their questions. As a result, I decided to write a pamphlet on each of the ten
areas—both to learn about the areas myself and to provide investors with a source of help. The first
pamphlet turned into a book. I decided at that point to cover the subject matter in five workbooks
which would constitute a course in the psychology of investing/trading. After I finished the second
workbook, I started training in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). NLP is really a science of
how to duplicate success, and I was able to incorporate a number of those techniques into my
course. The development of the course naturally led to a private consulting service.
Have your ideas and concepts changed from what they were early in your research?
I designed the test to predict who could win and who couldn't. Now, I believe that anyone can win
if they are committed to do so. Primarily, it's just a matter of learning how.
Too many people get stuck by the beliefs they hold, yet they continue to cling to those old beliefs.
My beliefs, in contrast, are constantly evolving, and I think it's because I value them according to
their utility. Thus, I'm willing to admit most of my beliefs are probably wrong. For example, there
may be people who could not be successful in trading even if they were committed to doing so. But
right now, it's most useful for me to believe that anyone can win. When I hold that belief, I am
much more effective at helping people become winners.
Could you provide some specific case examples of people who succeeded or failed in
consultation?
One trader who came to me hadn't been able to trade for over a year. He wanted me to get him
trading before he did the full consultation. As a result, I had him drop by one morning for about
forty-five minutes. I gathered some information and made an educated guess that he had a conflict
problem. He then went through an exercise that took about ten minutes. It took him two weeks to
mentally integrate the results of that exercise, but after that he was trading again. He'd spent a lot of
197



==================================================
                     PAGE 198                     
==================================================

money and done a lot of things to correct the problem and none of it had worked. Yet, it only took a
ten-minute exercise and two weeks of integrating the results to solve his problem.
I tried that with another person who was unable to afford my consulting fee, for whom a simple
exercise of that nature didn't work. His problem had nothing to do with his investing. Although he
was in his late forties, he was still a little boy in that he couldn't accept adult responsibilities. He
still lived with his mother, and his whole lifestyle supported being a child. The only reason he
wanted to trade was to be able to continue that lifestyle. I doubt that I could have helped him
without a major commitment on his part to change his lifestyle, which he was unwilling to give.
Another client made minor adjustments after two days of consulting. He was reluctant to do the
follow-up because he thought it would probably be superfluous. But he eventually decided to do it.
I spent another two days listening to him talk and then we did a simple exercise together. At the end
of that exercise, he was a totally changed person (although it probably took him a week to integrate
the effects of that exercise). He called me two months later and said he had made over $650,000
trading in the markets.
In the case of a trader who uses a nonquantifiable approach (for example, "I buy or sell
whenever I get a feeling about the market's impending direction from the chart patterns"),
how do you distinguish whether trading problems are related to lack of skill or to
psychological impediments to success?
Before I take someone on as a client, I need to know that they have some sort of methodology that
they think works. I determine what evidence they have of that. Can they, for example, convince
me? Have they tested that methodology? Does their testing amount to a hindsight evaluation, or is
it based on actual trading signals that one can follow. I also am convinced that it is difficult to make
money day trading or trading in a short time frame, so I am skeptical about anyone who wants me
to help them day trade successfully.
At the same time, I think that lack of skill is, in itself, a psychological impediment to trading.
People don't develop a systematic approach or don't test their approach because of poor judgment,
lack of goals, internal conflict, etc. So, perhaps the area they need help in is overcoming internal
resistance to developing a systematic approach to the market. If somebody came to me and said that
was the problem they wanted help with, I would have no problem at all accepting that person as a
client.
What are the primary psychological impediments that keep most people from being winning
traders? How can they deal with each of those problems?
What typically happens is that when people approach the markets, they bring their personal
problems with them. The markets are a natural place to act out those problems, but not to solve
them. Most people end up leaving the markets, but a few decide that they need a system to trade
more effectively. Those people who do adopt a systems approach usually just end up transferring
their problems from dealing with the market to dealing with their system of trading.
One of the basic problems that most traders face is dealing with risk. For example, two primary
rales to successful speculative trading are: Cut your losses short and let your profits ran. Most
people cannot deal with those two rales. For example, if making money is important to you—as it
is to most people who play investment games—then you will probably have trouble taking small
losses. As a result, small losses turn into moderate losses, which are even harder to take. Finally,
the moderate losses turn into big losses, which you are forced to take—all because it was so hard to
take a small loss. Similarly, when people have a profit, they want to take it right away. They think,
"I'd better take this now before it gets away." The bigger the profit becomes, the harder it is to resist
the temptation to take it now. The simple truth is that most people are risk-aversive in the realm of
profits—they prefer a sure, smaller gain to a wise gamble for a larger gain—and risk-seeking in the
realm of losses—they prefer an unwise gamble to a sure loss. As a result, most people tend to do
the opposite of what is required for success. They cut their profits short and let their losses run.
If you think of trading as a game and that a mistake is not following the rales of the game, then it
becomes much easier to follow these two rales. You should review your rales at the beginning of
the day and review your trading at the end of the day. If you followed your rales, even if you lost
money, pat yourself on the back. If you didn't follow your rales, then mentally rehearse what you
198



==================================================
                     PAGE 199                     
==================================================

did and give yourself more appropriate choices in the future.
The second majorproblem people have is dealing with stress. Stress really takes two forms: worry
and the biological fight/flight response. Our brains have a limited capacity for processing
information. If your mind is preoccupied with worry, that worry takes up most of the decision
space, and you don't have enough capacity left to perform effectively.
One aspect of the fight/flight response is that it causes people to narrow their focus. They revert to
earlier well-practiced response patterns. For example, a common decision that people make under
stress is not to decide. They do what they did when they were a beginner. They do what their
broker advises. In short, they do anything simple. Simple solutions are rarely correct. When people
are stressed, they also tend to be crowd followers. The behavior of others provides a simple
example to follow. Crowd followers don't have to make decisions, but crowd following is a sure
way to lose money in the markets.
A second important effect of the fight/flight response is that it causes people to expend more
energy. When faced with stressful events, people give more effort to the few alternatives they do
consider. They keep on doing what they were doing—only they do it harder. Putting more energy
into trading decisions does not help you make more money. Instead you will tend to make quick,
irrational choices, which use up some of that excess energy. You probably put more energy into a
losing position by actively resisting closing it out. The result is a bigger loss. In summary, the
fight/flight response will decrease your performance by causing you to narrow your choices and
concentrate more energy on the remaining alternatives.
The solution for dealing with stress is to work on the causes and to develop stress protectors. I
would recommend that people with this problem go into a stress management program. Also, it is
important to understand that many stressful events are such because of the way you perceive them.
Change those perceptions and you will change the event itself. For example, winners typically
differ from losers in their attitude about losses. Most people become anxious about losses, yet
successful speculators have learned that an essential ingredient to winning is to make it OK to lose.
Since most people in our culture are taught that only winning is acceptable, most investors must
change their beliefs about losses to become successful.
The third major problem that people have is dealing with conflict. People have different parts of
themselves, each of which has a positive intention. For example, someone might have a part to
make money, a part to protect him from failure, a part to make him feel good about himself, a part
which looks after the welfare of the family, etc. Now, once you establish these parts, you usually
allow them to operate subconsciously. What happens is the parts continually adopt new behaviors
to cany out their intentions. Sometimes, those new behaviors can produce major conflicts. This
model of conflict is one of my most useful beliefs. I'm not saying that people actually have parts,
but it is very useful in helping people solve their trading problems for me to believe that. You just
have to make them aware of their parts and then conduct a formal negotiation between the parts so
that each part is satisfied. If possible, you also want to integrate the parts so that they join together.
I find the concept of people having different parts in conflict with each other a little difficult
to conceptualize. Could you provide an example?
I worked with a floor trader whose father was fairly successful. His father was not a good model for
him, however, in that he was an alcoholic. As a result, he developed a part to protect himself from
being like his father. He could make about $75,000 per year trading, but if he made any more than
that, this part kicked in to make sure that he would not become too successful. He was the one who
made $650,000 in about two months after we had completed the parts negotiation.
Are you implying that some people actually want to lose on a subconscious level because it
fulfills some other positive intention? How common is that?
Half the traders I work with have problems of this nature. I think it's very common.
So far, you've cited poor risk attitudes, stress, and conflict as impediments to trading success.
Are there any other major problems people have with the markets?
A fourth major problem is that many people allow their emotions to control their trading. In fact,
most trading problems appear to involve emotional control in some manner. I know of at least ten
methods of helping people control their mental states. An easy method that people can adopt right
199



==================================================
                     PAGE 200                     
==================================================

away is simply to control posture, breathing, and muscle tension. If you change those factors, you
will probably find that you change your emotional state.
Finally, the last major problem is making decisions. Although there are many facets to decision-
making problems, what most people do is bring their normal method of making decisions to trading
the markets. For example, think about what you go through in order to buy a new car. You have to
think about the model, make, deal, service, cost, accessories, etc. And it probably takes you a week
or more to evaluate those factors and make a decision. Most people bring that same method of
making decisions to trading and it just doesn't work. It takes too much time. So, the solution is to
adopt a trading system that gives you signals to act. But most people with a trading system continue
to apply their normal method of making decisions to the signals given to them by their trading
system. And, of course, that doesn't work. The best method that I've found of dealing with long,
ineffective decision-making problems is to short circuit them through a process called anchoring.
That process is a little too involved to explain here.
Do you believe that most people can be successful traders if they learn to eliminate negative
emotions?
Well, that assumes that negative emotions are the cause of trading problems. I think they are just a
symptom of the basic problem. In most cases, I don't believe it's even necessary to solve specific
problems to produce success—you simply have to teach people to do things in an effective manner.
The teaching process, however, involves working with how people think, and most trainers do not
emphasize that.
Right now, I consider myself to be an expert modeler. By that, I mean that if someone can do
something well, then I can figure out how they do it and teach those skills to anyone else. I'm
concentrating on modeling trading and investment excellence. So naturally, I believe that I can
teach anyone who is committed to being a successful trader to be one of the best.
Are superior traders better because of keener analytical skills, or because they have better
emotional control?
Better emotional control, but I think that both of those factors are overemphasized.
So what does it take to duplicate successful trading?
There are three primary factors involved in duplicating success—beliefs, mental states, and mental
strategies. If you duplicate the way the best traders use those three factors for every aspect of the
trading task, then you can duplicate their results. As a nontrading example, most martial arts
experts believe that it takes years of practice to break a board with your bare hand. I was able to
observe someone for about fifteen minutes and then break two k-inch pine boards with my hand. I
even showed my son (who was ten at the time) how to do it. That's the power behind modeling.
What happens with most experts is that they are unconsciously competent. They do things well,
which means they do them automatically. For example, most people are unconsciously competent
at driving a car. You don't even think about it when you do it. When someone who is unconsciously
competent tries to explain what he or she is doing to someone else, much of what is important is
left out. Thus, my focus is to discover the missing pieces and help people install those pieces.
Let's talk about the first factor: beliefs. How are beliefs important to trading success?
Let me give you an example from another modeling project. The Army modeled the rifle skills of
the two best sharpshooters in the U.S. They were then able to develop a training class for Army
recruits in which they reduced the training time from four to two days, while increasing the
qualification rate from 80 to 100 percent. In addition, they were able to use the same knowledge to
help the top shooters improve their skills. The information they gathered about shooting beliefs was
particularly revealing.
The two top shooters, for example, believed:
• Shooting well is important for my survival.
• Hunting is fun.
• Mental rehearsal is important to successful performance.
• If I miss a shot, it has something to do with my performance.
200



==================================================
                     PAGE 201                     
==================================================

One of the two top shooters, when they were in competition together, always won. And you
could tell the difference between the two in accordance with their beliefs. For example, the
best shooter believed that it was important to rehearse an entire 1,000-round match the prior
evening, whereas the second best shooter only believed that mental rehearsal was important.
In addition, the best shooter believed that it was important to hit the center of the bull's eye
on each shot (even though you didn't get extra points for that), whereas the second best
shooter believed that it was only important to hit the bull's eye. Can you understand why one
was better than the other just from their beliefs?
Now, contrast the beliefs of top shooters with the beliefs of new recruits coming into the Army.
The latter might believe:
• Guns are evil; they kill people.
• If they shoot this weapon too many times, they might go deaf.
• If they miss the target, it means the gun is misaligned.
I think, just on beliefs alone, you can begin to understand why the top shooters were so much better
than the raw recruits.
Now, let me explain some of my findings in working with top traders. You might find some of
these beliefs confirmed in other interviews in your book. Generally, I find that top traders believe:
• Money is NOT important.
• It is OK to lose in the markets.
• Trading is a game.
• Mental rehearsal is important for success.
• They've won the game before they start.
Although there are a lot more than five critical beliefs, I think these five are among the most
important. Most people approach trading to make a lot of money, and that is one of the primary
reasons they lose. Because money is so important, they have trouble taking losses and letting
profits ran. In contrast, when you think of trading as a game and play by certain rules, then it
becomes much easier to follow those two golden rales.
In addition, because of mental rehearsal and extensive planning, top traders have already gone
through all the trial and error in their mind before they begin. As a result, they know they are going
to win in the long ran, and that makes the little setbacks much easier to deal with.
You mentioned that winners know they've won the game before they start. Although I can
easily see how such confidence would be beneficial for the established winning trader, might
the impact of this trait actually be reversed for the novice trader? For example, in your first
week on skis, confidence about your ability to go down the expert slope might not be such a
great quality. How does the less expert trader distinguish between justified and misplaced
confidence?
The top traders that I've worked with began their careers with an extensive study of the markets.
They developed and refined models of how to trade. They mentally rehearsed what they wanted to
do extensively until they had the belief that they would win. At this point, they had both the
confidence and the commitment necessary to produce success. In addition, they also had the entire
constellation of beliefs I just described. As a result, I believe that there are three major differences
between justified confidence and misplaced confidence. First of all, justified confidence comes
from a constellation of beliefs, such as the one I just described. If a trader has confidence and
nothing else, he is probably in a lot of trouble. Second, justified confidence comes from extensive
testing of some sort of model of trading. If you don't have a model that you have properly tested,
then your confidence is probably misplaced. Third, justified confidence comes with an extensive
commitment to being successful as a trader. Most people who want to be traders are not com-
mitted—they just think they are. There is a poem by W. N. Murray, of the Scottish Himalayan
expedition, that says: "That the moment that one definitely commits oneself, then Providence
moves too."
If you are really committed, then not only are you certain that you are doing the right thing, but
somehow events just seem to occur to help you. If you are really committed to being a trader, then
you probably have an understanding at some level of what I'm talking about. You probably even
understand that those events that help you might be big losses. If you are not committed, on the
201



==================================================
                     PAGE 202                     
==================================================

other hand, then you are probably saying, "I don't understand what Tharp is saying. I'm committed,
but events certainly have not been helping me."
Earlier, you mentioned "mental states" as the second critical factor in modeling success.
Could you explain what you mean by that?
If you ask people to list their trading or investment problems, they are of two types—problems they
don't own and mental state control problems. Problems they don't own consist of blaming the
markets, blaming floor traders or locals, blaming insider trading, blaming their broker, or blaming
their system for what goes wrong. We have a natural tendency to blame something other than
ourselves for what happens. Society promotes it. For example, the recent media coverage of
program trading virtually implies that investors who lost money in the stock market did so because
of this activity, rather than because of any fault of their own. Yet, when you blame something other
than yourself, you can continue to repeat the mistake because it was the result of something beyond
your control.
The best thing an investor can do, when things go wrong, is to determine how he or she produced
those results. Now, I don't mean that you should blame yourself for your mistakes either. I mean
that at some point in time, for any situation, you made a choice that produced those results.
Determine what that choice point was and give yourself other options to take when you encounter a
similar choice point in the future. Change the decision at similar choice points in the future and you
will change the results you get. And by imagining doing so now, you can make it easy to select
those alternatives in the future.
When people own their own problems, they discover that their results usually stem from some sort
of mental state. Common examples are:
• I'm too impatient with the markets.
• I get angry at the markets.
• I'm afraid at the wrong time.
• I'm too optimistic about what will happen.
These are just a few examples of mental state problems. Once you identify a mental state problem,
you can do something about it because this sort of problem is within your control. I've already
mentioned how one can use body posture, breaming, and muscle control to manipulate one's mental
state. To try this out for yourself, go into a shopping mall and notice how other people walk.
Duplicate a dozen or so walks for yourself and notice how your mental state changes with each one.
I'm not saying that controlling your mental state is the magic solution to trading success. It's just
part of the answer. But when you admit that the answer is within yourself, you've come a long way.
The realization that you are responsible for the results you get is the key to successful investing.
Winners know they are responsible for their results; losers think they are not.
Can you give a practical example of how someone can control their mental state?
Well, mental state manipulation is what most people call discipline. I teach people a very simple
procedure that they can use right away. For example, suppose you are at your desk and you become
aware that you are in a mental state that you would like to change. Get up out of the chair. Walk
away about four feet and then look at how you looked in that chair. Notice your posture, your
breathing, your facial expressions. Then imagine how you would look if you had the sort of mental
state you would like. When you can see that clearly, sit down in the chair again and assume the
position that you just imagined. That exercise works for almost any situation as it involves several
important principles—changing your body posture, seeing yourself from a more objective
viewooint, and imagining a more resourceful state.
Please elaborate on mental strategies—the third element you cited earlier as critical to
duplicating success. Could you provide some examples?
To understand strategies, you have to understand how people think. People think in the same
modalities as their five senses, that is, in terms of visual images, sounds, feelings, and for some
people, tastes and smells. Those five modalities are to mental strategies as the alphabet is to a great
novel, or as musical notes are to a great symphony. It's not the elements, but the way in which the
elements are put together. A mental strategy is really the sequence in which you think.
Rather than explain a complex topic in detail, which I think is beyond the scope of this interview,
202



==================================================
                     PAGE 203                     
==================================================

let me give you two examples. First, imagine that you have a trading system that gives you specific
signals. Since most signals are visual, such as a particular chart pattern or certain signals on your
computer, imagine that your system gives you visual signals. Now, try on the following strategy:
• See the signal.
• Recognize that it is familiar.
• Tell yourself what might go wrong if you take it.
• Feel bad about it.
Could you trade effectively using that strategy? Would you even take the signal? Probably not!
What if you used the following strategy?
• See the signal.
• Recognize that it is familiar.
• Feel good about it.
Could you trade from that signal? Probably. So even though the two strategies are quite similar,
they lead to very different results in terms of trading. If you are trading a system, you need a simple
strategy like the last one in order to use it effectively.
Two of the top traders that you used in your research in modeling success have completely
different trading styles. One is very mechanical, while the other uses a much more intuitive
approach. Could you contrast their differences and compare their similarities?
First, let me talk about their similarities, because they are extensive. In fact, when you find
extensive similarities between two excellent traders who seem so different, then you can begin to
assume that those similarities are essential to successful trading. Both traders, for example,
developed models for how the markets work and did extensive research to test those models.
Although their ideas are very different, I think the process of developing and testing some sort of
model is probably very important. In addition, both traders share all the same beliefs that I men-
tioned earlier as common to successful traders. Third, both traders are very aware of their purpose
in life and as a trader. They believe they are part of a "bigger picture" and they just go with the
flow.
The mechanical trader is very logical. He constructs his models visually in his imagination. He is
very precise in his language and thinking. His models tend to focus on his concept of how to trade
successfully and of how the economy works. He does not believe that his models are adequate until
they can be converted into algorithms for the computer that match his own mental processes. As a
result of this belief, he has computerized his models, modifying both his constructed image and his
computer output, until both models match—in his words, "until they both look right." This is a very
slow and laborious process. I think it hinders his decision making on everyday events, and he tends
to agree with me, but it helps him in the long run. When his mental image and the computer model
match, he virtually takes himself out of the trading picture. The computer does everything, so at
that point, decision making is easy for him.
The intuitive trader, in contrast, has developed a model of how he thinks markets operate, rather
than a model of how to trade successfully. He also believes that the markets are constantly evolving
and that it is more important to keep up with changes in the market than to test his models by
developing an algorithm to computerize them. He trades from his expectations of what the markets
will do, which are visualizations. But I think that he tends to convert his visualizations into
feelings. Feelings actually are a mode of thinking, but they are difficult to communicate to others or
to computerize. As a result, he believes that exercises such as computerizing a trading system are a
waste of time. Remember that his main emphasis is to explain how markets work (rather than how
to trade), and he believes that the markets are constantly evolving. As a result, he has difficulty
explaining how he trades to anyone else. He just calls it intuitive. At the same time, he makes day-
to-day decisions easily—a distinct contrast to the mechanical trader who is uncomfortable until he
has proven his work by computerizing it.
What are the most difficult problems to solve?
I think there are only two difficult problems. One is lack of commitment to trading. People are not
going to do what I tell them to do unless they are committed to becoming a good trader, so I don't
see many noncommitted traders. It's only occasionally, when I do a free or reduced-rate
203



==================================================
                     PAGE 204                     
==================================================

consultation, that I see traders with this sort of problem. The man who wanted to remain a little
boy, and was trying to use trading as a means of accomplishing that, was a classic example. I don't
make the mistake of seeing noncommitted traders too often.
The second most difficult situation is the trader who does not own his problems. This person can
continue to repeat his problems because he never gets at the source. Once again, I usually don't see
these people. When people come to me, they realize that they produce their own problems,
although, to some extent, everyone has problems that they don't own—even my clients.
Among the people who come to see me, I think the most difficult type is the compulsive gambler.
Since these people typically crave the action of the markets, they are not likely to want my help
until they are heavily into debt. At that point, I refer them to Gamblers Anonymous or to some local
source forhelp. However, I have had one compulsive trader among my clients. He's now in my
super-trader program. I've simply channeled his compulsiveness from the markets into working on
himself.
I'm not sure that correcting trading problems is always the answer though. For example, one
approach to teaching a class on trading would be to give everyone the fundamentals in the first
session and a simple trading system in the second. You could then spend the remaining sessions
dealing with their problems trading that system. That would probably be a very effective class. On
the other hand, you could conduct the same class by giving them the fundamentals. Then you might
give them the beliefs, mental states, and mental strategies necessary to trade the system. Finally,
you might give them the system. I'm willing to bet that the second method would be more effective
than the first. At least that is the direction I'm heading.
Talk about the origins, concepts, and direction of your super-trader program.
It all began on Christmas Eve one year, when that one trader called and told me that he had made
$650,000 in the two months since I had finished working with him. In a sense, I felt that we had
only started working together. The more I thought about it, the more the question kept popping into
my mind: "What if we pushed this to the limits? What is he capable of accomplishing?" So the idea
of the super-trader program was born from those thoughts. I called him up and suggested the idea to
him. Naturally, he was all for it.
About four of my clients have now graduated to the super-trader program. It simply means that I
continue to work with these people on a regular basis (usually semiarmualry). The idea is to stretch
their performance to the limits. Many people aren't ready for that, but I have enough among my
clients who are. Who knows, in three or four years, I might just have about fifty top traders that I
work with on a continual basis! Incidentally, I find that my best clients now make excellent models
to use to study top traders.
I sometimes have dreams which involve impending market direction. Although these are
rather infrequent, they prove right a high percentage of the time. Is this unusual?
I imagine that it's quite common because people tell me that all the time, especially top traders. For
example, both the mechanical and intuitive super-traders that we talked about earlier expressed that
they had dreams about the market that were amazingly accurate. But most traders say that such
dreams are infrequent enough so that they could not trade on them regularly. This phenomenon
may even occur more frequently than one might imagine—in symbolic form. But most people do
not bother to interpret their dreams, so they miss the symbolic predictions. However, I must admit
that although it interests me, I have not investigated this area very extensively.
I know of lots of people of genius level who claim that some of their creativity comes from their
dreams. Michael Jackson claims he doesn't write his songs—they just come to him. Paul
McCartney said that he heard the song "Yesterday" in a dream. Einstein essentially dreamed the
theory of relativity. I think there are probably a lot of famous examples of this sort. It all boils
down to what intuition really is, but don't ask me to explain it. I don't understand it—YET!
I assume that the reason you have not tried trading again is that you perceive that it would
interfere with your objectivity in dealing with your clients. Yet, given all that you have
learned about successful trading during the past five years, I imagine there must be some
temptation to try it again. How do you handle this conflict? What do you envision as the long-term
resolution?
204



==================================================
                     PAGE 205                     
==================================================

There are two reasons I don't trade. The first is the reason you mentioned about objectivity with
clients. If I'm helping someone trade and I have conflicting positions, then I may not be very
objective about what they are doing. An equally important reason, however, is that I am fully com-
mitted to doing what I am doing. I love helping other people, writing, giving talks, and so on. I'm
very happy doing that. It is also a sixty-hour per week job right now. If I wanted to start trading,
then I would have to devote almost as much time to doing that, at least at the beginning. Why
should I do that and give up what I already know I love doing? Player coaches, in the history of
most sports, usually are not that effective at either coaching or playing.
Your question also assumes that I am committed to trade, and as a result there is a conflict.
Actually, I find that as I get more and more into helping others become successful, I have less and
less interest in trading myself. I'm investing in myself and in my business right now. I constantly
work at improving my skills and knowledge, and that is paying off forme. Why should I dilute that
effort? Perhaps some time in the future, I will decide that I have done everything I can do, or
perhaps I'll want to change what I'm doing, or perhaps I'll just want a break. For example, three to
four years from now I might just be working with fifty or more top quality traders. If that happens,
then maybe I'll also trade. But for the near future, it doesn't seem very likely.

==================================================

The Trade-A Personal Experience
In the course of conducting the interviews for this book, I came to realize that one of my primary
motives for the entire project was a quest for self-discovery. Although I have been a net profitable
trader over the years (substantially multiplying a small initial stake on two separate occasions), I
had a definite sense of failure about my trading. Given the extent of my knowledge and experience
about markets and trading, as well as the fact that on numerous occasions I had correctly
anticipated major price moves, I felt that my winnings were small potatoes compared to what I
should have made.
In one of my trips for this book, on one evening, I was interviewed at length about my trading by
Dr. Van Tharp, and the very next evening, I had a probing conversation about my trading with the
very perceptive Ed Seykota. This back-to-back experience caused me to focus intensely on the
flaws that had prevented me from reaching what I perceived to be my true potential as a trader.
As a result of this self-examination, I came to realize that one of my great errors had been failing to
exploit major price moves that I had correctly anticipated. Invariably, my initial position would be
far too small, given the potential I perceived in such trades. This mistake was then compounded by
a highly premature liquidation of the position. Typically, I would take profits on the first leg of the
price move, with the intention of reentering the position on a correction. The problem was that
subsequent corrections usually fell short of my reentry points and, refusing to chase the market, I
ended up watching the rest of the price move unfold while I was on the sidelines. I vowed to myself
that the next time such a situation would arise, I would make a concentrated effort to come closer to
realizing the true potential of the trade.
I did not have to wait very long. Two weeks later, while on a plane to Chicago to conduct some
further interviews, I was thinking about my review of the price charts the previous evening. I
recalled that I had come away with the distinct impression that precious metal prices were ready to
move higher, even though the foreign currency markets appeared vulnerable to further price
erosion. Suddenly, the trade I should have made became crystal clear. Given my combination of
expectations, a trade of long precious metals and short foreign currencies would be particularly
attractive. (Since these markets normally move in the same direction, the combined position
implied less risk than an outright long position in precious metals.) I made a mental note to
generate some charts on this trade at my first opportunity.
The next morning, I found a quote machine capable of generating price charts and sat down to
evaluate various price relationships. First, I looked at the interrelationships between silver, gold,
and platinum and decided that silver was my preferred buy among the metals. Then I reviewed the
interrelationships between the various foreign currencies and decided that the Swiss franc appeared
to be the weakest currency. Having made these two determinations, I then reviewed charts of the
silver/Swiss franc ratio for various time spectrums, ranging from ten years to one month.
This analysis led me to the conclusion that we were at the brink of a possible multiyear advance of
silver relative to the Swiss franc. Although I had intended not to trade because my traveling
prevented me from paying attention to the markets, the potential of the trade seemed so dynamic
that I had to put on at least a base position. To be done properly, a ratio trade requires
approximately equal dollar positions in each market. I quickly calculated that at the prevailing price
levels, it would require approximately three long silver contracts to balance one short Swiss franc
contract.
I looked at a short-term chart of the silver/Swiss franc price ratio. To my dismay, the price ratio had
already moved sharply in the direction of my intended trade since my realization about it the
previous morning. Even on that morning's opening, the trade could have been implemented at much
more favorable price levels. As I was trying to decide what to do, the silver/Swiss franc ratio
continued to move higher and higher. I decided that I had to act to prevent the possibility of
missing this trade altogether. I immediately called in an order establishing the minimum position of
long three silver contracts and short one Swiss franc contract. No sooner had I placed the order than
the price ratio seemed to reach its peak and began retreating. The ratio pulled back further during
the next two days. As it turned out, I had managed to implement the trade at the exact worst
possible moment in time since the inception of my idea. However, the silver/Swiss franc price ratio
206



==================================================
                     PAGE 207                     
==================================================

quickly recovered, and a few days later I was well ahead.
At this point, I thought about my recent realization regarding my continued failure to adequately
profit from major price moves. I decided to maintain my position and, moreover, selected a reaction
point for doubling up the position. The correction came about a week later and I followed my game
plan. My timing proved good, as the trade once again rebounded in my favor—this time with
double the initial position. Given my account size (approximately $70,000 at the time), the long six
silver/short two Swiss franc position was about twice as large as the one I normally would have
held. My efforts to correct my aforementioned trading flaw seemed to be paying off, as the trade
raced in my favor during the following two weeks. Within a month of putting on the trade, my
account was up over 30 percent.
I now faced a dilemma: On the one hand, my new-found realization suggested that I hang on to the
trade for the long run. On the other hand, one of my other rales is that if you are ever lucky enough
to realize a very large profit on a trade very quickly, take it, because you will usually get an
opportunity to reenter the trade at considerably more favorable levels. The second rale came to
mind when the silver/Swiss franc price ratio began falling.
A cursory examination of the price charts suggested it might be prudent to take at least partial
profits. I should have done more analysis to reach a decision. However, the combination of having
undertaken a new job, while at the same time writing this book, left me with very little time and
energy to focus on other areas—trading included. Instead of doing the necessary work, I made a
snap judgment to stay with the trade.
The trade now moved swiftly against me, and within a week, I had given back a significant portion
of my earlier gains.
Although a week earlier, I had rationalized that my substantial profits would give me enough of a
comfort cushion in the event of a reaction, now that such a reaction had occurred, I found that I had
seriously misjudged my comfort level. Suddenly, I was concerned that I might give back all my
profits, and possibly even ride the trade into a loss. I could not decide whether to blow out of the
trade or stay with it as initially planned.
That night I had a dream. I was talking to a friend of mine, who is a developer of software for the
analysis of futures and options markets, but not a trader. In my dream, he had begun trading. We
were talking about trading and my current dilemma regarding the silver/Swiss franc position.
My friend commented on my predicament, "Everybody gets what they want out of the markets." I
replied, "You sound just like Ed Seykota." This sounded a bit odd to me, since as far as I knew, he
did not even know Seykota. To my surprise, he answered, "I have been talking to Ed Seykota for a
while and I have been winning in my trading ever since."
He had a sheet in front of him, with one of the columns indicating his month-to-month ending
equity. I glanced at the sheet and was astounded to see that the last figure exceeded $18 million. I
exclaimed, "Bert, you have made $18 million in the market! I hope you plan to take a few million
out for safekeeping." "No, I need all the money for trading," he replied. "But that is crazy," I said.
"Take $3 or $4 million out, and that way you will be sure then that no matter what happens, you
will come out way ahead." "I know what I am doing, and as long as I do my homework on the
markets every day, I am not concerned," he replied.
His answer had implied, quite correctly, that I did not diligently do my homework on the markets
every day. His point, although unstated, was quite clear: If I did my work on the markets every day,
I wouldn't have any trouble understanding why he did not need to pull out several million dollars in
profits from his account to feel confident that he would not lose back all his profits in trading.
"You say you don't have enough time each day to do your work on the markets. You are too busy
with your new job and writing your book. Here, letme show you something." He started citing
assumptions regarding the sales of my book, royalties per copy sold, and the total hours I had spent
writing the book. He then scribbled various calculations on a yellow pad. He arrived at a final
figure of $18.50 per hour. "Here," he said, "this is what you are making on your book." The tone of
his voice implied that I was crazy to jeopardize tens of thousands of dollars in my trading for such a
paltry sum. (Actually, the $18.50 estimate is probably wildly overinflated, but remember this was a
dream.)
It was no coincidence that this dream occurred the night after editing the section of the Marty

Schwartz interview dealing with his diligence in doing his daily homework on the markets. I
realized that there are no shortcuts. If you want to be a good trader, you have to do your work on
the markets every day. If there is not enough time, you have to make time. The costs for straying
from this daily discipline, in terms of lost profit opportunities as well as losses, can be very
substantial. The message my subconscious seemed to be crying out was: If you are going to be
serious about trading, you have to reestablish your time priorities.

Postscript-Dreams and Trading
The relationship between dreams and trading is a fascinating subject. Readers may look up
Seykota's and Tharp's comments on this matter. There was another interview in which this topic
was prominently discussed. In that instance, the trader decided to rescind his approval for use of
our conversation in the book. I was somewhat puzzled by his decision, since the chapter was
basically complimentary. "What could you possibly have found so offensive as to back out
completely?" I asked. "Absolutely nothing," he replied. "In fact, you made me sound almost
human." It turned out that he was upset about his inclusion in a recently published book and that he
was adamantly opposed to his appearance in any book. Even the offer of anonymity failed to
change his decision. I did, however, manage to get his permission to use the dream-related portion
of the interview. (The name references in the following conversation have been changed.)
In 1980, the year when corn set its record high, I was long the position limit. One night I had the
following dream. I'm talking to myself and I say, "Hey Jerry, where is corn going to?" "To $4.15."
"Where is corn now?" "$4.07." "You mean you are taking all that risk for an extra eight cents? Are
you crazy?" I woke up in a flash. I knew I had to get out of my entire corn position as soon as the
market opened the next day.
The next morning, the market opened up a little higher, and I started selling. The market moved a
little higher, and I sold more heavily. The market moved up some more. For a minute, I thought the
floor broker had executed my order backwards. He hadn't.
Anyway, a few minutes later, I'm completely out of my position and the phone rings. It's my friend
Carl, another good trader, who had also been long corn. He says, "Jerry, is that you doing all the
selling?" I tell him, "Yes, I just got out of my entire position." "What are you doing?" he shouts. I
say, "Carl, where is corn going to?" "About $4.15-4.20," he replies. "Where is corn now?" I ask
him. I hear an immediate click over the phone. He didn't even waste any time saying good-bye.
And was that the top of the corn market?
It might have gone up another day, but that was just about the high. Once it started falling, I could
never have unloaded a position of my size.
I found this trader's narration of his dream particularly fascinating, since I have occasionally had
similar experiences. Usually, I have found that when you feel strongly enough about a trade (either
getting in or getting out) to dream about it, the message should be heeded. Of course, like anything
else, this does not work all the time, but I believe it places the odds more in your favor.
As I interpret it, the dream is the means by which our subconscious penetrates the barriers we
sometimes erect in accepting the true analysis of a market. For example, if I am bullish and not in a
market, I might rationalize that it is prudent to wait for a reaction before entering the trade—even if
a realistic assessment would suggest that such a development is unlikely. This is because entering
the market at a higher price is a confirmation that, to some extent, I have already failed (that is, by
not buying sooner)—a distasteful acknowledgment. In such a case, a dream that the market was
going to run away on the upside might be the subconscious' way of breaking through mental
impediments.

Final Word
There is no holy grail to trading success. The methodologies employed by the "market wizards"
cover the entire spectrum from purely technical to purely fundamental—and everything in between.
The length of time they typically hold a trade ranges from minutes to years. Although the styles of
the traders are very different, many common denominators were evident:
1. All those interviewed had a driving desire to become successful traders—in many cases,
overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goal.
2. All reflected confidence that they could continue to win over the long run. Almost invariably,
they considered their own trading as the best and safest investment for their money.
3. Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It
is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned.
4. The top traders take their trading very seriously; most devote a substantial amount of their
waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy.
5. Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those
interviewed.
6. In a variety of ways, many of the traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait
for the right trading opportunity to present itself.
7. The importance of acting independent of the crowd was a frequently emphasized point.
8. All the top traders understand that losing is part of the game.
9. They all love what they are doing.

Appendix 1-Program Trading and Portfolio Insurance
One subject that has received widespread publicity in recent years is program trading. Perhaps
never in the history of financial markets has there been more criticism about a trading approach that
was less understood. I would venture a guess that less than one out of ten people opposed to
program trading even know the definition of the term. One source of confusion is that program
trading is used interchangeably to describe both the original activity and as a more general term
encompassing various computer-supported trading strategies (for example, portfolio insurance).
Program trading represents a classic arbitrage activity in which one market is bought against an
equal short sale in a closely related market in order to realize small, near risk-free profits, resulting
from short-lived distortions in the price relationship between such markets. Program traders buy or
sell an actual basket of stocks against an equal dollar value position in stock index futures when
they perceive the actual stocks to be underpriced or overpriced relative to futures. In effect,
program trading tends to keep actual stock and stock index futures prices in line. Insofar as every
program-related sale of actual stocks is offset by a purchase at another time and most program
trades are first initiated as long stock/short futures positions (because of the uptick requirement in
shorting actual stocks), arguments that program trading is responsible for stock market declines are
highly tenuous. Moreover, since the bulk of economic evidence indicates that arbitrage between
related markets tends to reduce volatility, the relationship between increased volatility and program
trading is questionable at best.
Portfolio insurance refers to the systematic sale of stock index futures as the value of a stock
portfolio declines in order to reduce risk exposure. Once reduced, the net long exposure is
increased back toward a full position as the representative stock index price increases. The theory
underlying portfolio insurance presumes that market prices move smoothly. When prices witness
an abrupt, huge move, the results of the strategy may differ substantially from the theory. This
occurred on October 19, 1987, when prices gapped beyond threshold portfolio insurance sell levels,
triggering an avalanche of sell orders which were executed far below the theoretical levels.
Although portfolio insurance may have accelerated the decline on October 19, it could reasonably
be argued that the underlying forces would have resulted in a similar price decline over a greater
span of days in the absence of portfolio insurance. This is a question that can never be answered. (It
is doubtful that program trading, as defined above, played much of a role in the crash of the week
of October 19, since the severely delayed openings of individual stocks, tremendous confusion
related to prevailing price levels, and exchange restrictions regarding the use of the automated
order entry systems severely impeded this activity.)

Appendix 2 - Options—Understanding the Basics*
There are two basic types of options: calls and puts. The purchase of a call option provides the
buyer with the right—but not the obligation— to purchase the underlying item at a specified price,
called the strike or exercise price, at any time up to and including the expiration date. Aput option
provides the buyer with the right—but not the obligation—to sell the underlying item at the strike
price at any time prior to expiration. (Note, therefore, that buying a put is a bearish trade, while
selling a put is a bullish trade.) The price of an option is called a premium. As an example of an
option, an IBM April 130 call gives the purchaser the right to buy 100 shares of IBM at $130 per
share at any time during the life of the option.
The buyer of a call seeks to profit from an anticipated price rise by locking in a specified purchase
price. The call buyer's maximum possible loss will be equal to the dollar amount of the premium
paid for the option. This maximum loss would occur on an option held until expiration if the strike
price was above the prevailing market price. For example, if IBM was trading at $125 when the
130 option expired, the option would expire worthless. If at expiration, the price of the underlying
market was above the strike price, the option would have some value and would hence be
exercised. However, if the difference between the market price and the strike price was less than
the premium paid for the option, the net result of the trade would still be a loss. In order for a call
buyer to realize a net profit, the difference between the market price and the strike price would have
to exceed the premium paid when the call was purchased (after adjusting for commission cost). The
higher the market price, the greater the resulting profit.
The buyer of a put seeks to profit from an anticipated price decline by locking in a sales price. Like
the call buyer, his maximum possible loss is limited to the dollar amount of the premium paid for
the option. In the case of a put held until expiration, the trade would show a net profit if the strike
price exceeded the market price by an amount greater than the premium of the put at purchase
(after adjusting for commission cost).
Whereas the buyer of a call or put has limited risk and unlimited potential gain, the reverse is true
for the seller. The option seller (often called the writer) receives the dollar value of the premium in
return for undertaking the obligation to assume an opposite position at the strike price if an option
is exercised. For example, if a call is exercised, the seller must assume a short position in the
underlying market at the strike price (since by exercising the call, the buyer assumes a long position
at that price).
The seller of a call seeks to profit from an anticipated sideways to modestly declining market. In
such a situation, the premium earned by selling a call provides the most attractive trading
opportunity. However, if the trader expected a large price decline, he would usually be better off
going short the underlying market or buying a put—trades with open-ended profit potential. In a
similar fashion, the seller of a put seeks to profit from an anticipated sideways to modestly rising
market.
Some novices have trouble understanding why a trader would not always prefer the buy side of the
option (call or put, depending on market opinion), since such a trade has unlimited potential and
limited risk. Such confusion reflects the failure to take probability into account. Although the
option seller's theoretical risk is unlimited, the price levels that have the greatest probability of
occurrence (i.e., prices in the vicinity of the market price when the option trade occurs) would
result in a net gain to the option seller. Roughly speaking, the option buyer accepts a large
probability of a small loss in return for a small probability of a large gain, whereas the option seller
accepts a small probability of a large loss in exchange for a large probability of a small gain. In an
efficient market, neither the consistent option buyer nor the consistent option seller should have any
significant advantage over the long run.
The option premium consists of two components: intrinsic value plus time value. The intrinsic
value of a call option is the amount by which the current market price is above the strike price. (The
intrinsic value of a put option is the amount by which the current market price is below the strike
price.) In effect, the intrinsic value is that part of the premium that could be realized if the option
were exercised at the current market price. The intrinsic value serves as a floor price for an option.
Why? Because if the premium were less than the intrinsic value, a trader could buy and exercise the

option and immediately offset the resulting market position, thereby realizing a net gain (assuming
that the trader covers at least transaction costs).
Options that have intrinsic value (i.e., calls with strike prices below the market price and puts with
strike prices above the market price) are said to be in-the-money. Options that have no intrinsic
value are called out-of-the-money options. Options with a strike price closest to the market price are
called at-the-money options.
An out-of-the-money option, which by definition has an intrinsic value equal to zero, will still have
some value because of the possibility that the market price will move beyond the strike price prior
to the expiration date. An in-the-money option will have a value greater than the intrinsic value
because a position in the option will be preferred to a position in the underlying market. Why?
Because both the option and the market position will gain equally in the event of a favorable price
movement, but the option's maximum loss is limited. The portion of the premium that exceeds the
intrinsic value is called the time value.
The three most important factors that influence an option's time value are:
(I) Relationship between the strike and market price—Deeply out-of-the-money options will have
little time value since it is unlikely that the market price will move to the strike price—or beyond—
prior to expiration. Deeply in-the-money options have little time value, because these options offer
positions very similarto the underlying market—both will gain and lose equivalent amounts for all
but an extremely adverse price move. In other words, for a deeply in-the-money option, the fact
that risk is limited is not worth very much, because the strike price is so far from the prevailing
market price.
(2) Time remaining until expiration—The more time remaining until expiration, the greater the
value of the option. This is true because a longer life span increases the probability of the intrinsic
value increasing by any specified amount prior to expiration.
(3) Volatility—Time value will vary directly with the estimated volatility [a measure of the degree
of price variability] of the underlying market for the remaining life span of the option. This
relationship is a result of the fact that greater volatility raises the probability of the intrinsic value
increasing by any specified amount prior to expiration. In other words, the greater the volatility, the
greater the probable price range of the market.
Although volatility is an extremely important factor in the determination of option premium values,
it should be stressed that the future volatility of a market is never precisely known until after the
fact. (In contrast, the time remaining until expiration and the relationship between the current
market price and the strike price can be exactly specified at any juncture.) Thus, volatility must
always be estimated on the basis of historical volatility data. The future volatility estimate implied
by market prices (i.e., option premiums), which may be higher or lower than the historical
volatility, is called the implied volatility.
