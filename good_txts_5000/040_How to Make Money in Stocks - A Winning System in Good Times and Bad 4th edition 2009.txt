(cid:129) INTRODUCTION (cid:129)
You Can Learn and Benefit
from America’s 100 Years
of Super Winners
After the market debacles of 2000 and 2008, most investors now know that they
need to take charge and learn much more about what they’re doing when
they save and invest their hard-earned money. However, many investors
don’t know where to turn, whom to trust, or what they must stop doing if
they are to achieve dramatically superior investment performance.
You don’t have to give your money to a Bernie Madoff, who’ll take it but
won’t tell you exactly what he’s doing with it. Instead, you can and should
read a few good investment books, attend some investment classes, or par-
ticipate in an investment meet-up group so that you can learn how to
invest with real confidence. At the very least, you should learn and under-
stand well the sound principles and proven rules and methods that will
protect and build your investment portfolio over time. Half of all Ameri-
cans save and invest; now it’s time to learn to do it intelligently with criti-
cal knowledge.
When I started investing, I made most of the same mistakes you’ve prob-
ably made. But here’s what I’ve learned:
(cid:129) You should buy stocks when they’re on the way up in price, not on the
way down. And when you buy more, you do it only after the stock has
risen from your purchase price, not after it has fallen below it.
(cid:129) You buy stocks when they’re nearer to their highs for the year, not when
they’ve sunk so low that they look cheap. You buy higher-priced stocks
rather than the lowest-priced stocks.

A WINNING SYSTEM
• You learn to always sell stocks quickly when you have a small loss rather
than waiting and hoping they’ll come back.
• You pay far less attention to a company’s book value, dividends, or PE
ratio—which for the last 100 years have had little predictive value in spot-
ting America’s most successful companies—and focus instead on more
important proven factors such as profit growth, price and volume action,
and whether the company is the number one profit leader in its field with
a superior product.
• You don’t subscribe to a bunch of market newsletters or advisory services,
and you don’t let yourself be influenced by recommendations from ana-
lysts, who, after all, are just expressing personal opinions that can fre-
quently be wrong.
• You also have to acquaint yourself with charts—an invaluable tool most
professionals wouldn’t do without but amateurs tend to dismiss as com-
plicated or irrelevant.
All these vital actions are completely contrary to human nature. In reality,
the stock market is human nature and crowd psychology on daily display,
plus the age-old law of supply and demand at work. Because these factors
have remained the same over time, it is remarkable but true that chart pat-
terns are just the same today as they were 50 years ago or 100 years ago. Few
investors know or understand this. It can be to your inspiring advantage.
In this fourth edition of How to Make Money in Stocks, I’m showing you
right up front, in Chapter 1, 100 annotated color charts of 100 of America’s
greatest winning stocks, covering each decade from the 1880s to the end of
2008—from the Richmond and Danville Railroad in 1885 and Northern
Pacific during the famous corner of the stock in 1901, when it raced from
$115 to $700 in one week, to Apple and Google in our twenty-first century.
There is a lot you can learn from studying these great examples. You’ll see
that there are such things as chart bases that have been repeated year after
year with enormous success. There are 105 examples (among the 100 stocks)
of classic bases that look like cups with handles when viewed from the side.
Some are small, others large, and still others in between.
In addition to cups with handles, we’ve identified eight other distinctively
different, highly successful base patterns that have occurred in cycle after
cycle. Bethlehem Steel in 1915 is our first powerful high, tight flag example
and served as a perfect historical precedent for later high, tight flags such as
Syntex, Rollins, Simmonds Precision, Yahoo!, and Taser. All of these stocks
had huge price moves.
Charts will help you tell the better stocks and general markets from the
weaker, riskier stocks and markets that you must sidestep and avoid alto-

Introduction
gether. That’s why I put all these examples in Chapter 1, with notes marked
on the charts to help you learn a skill that could just change your whole life
and let you live better and smarter.
A good clear picture is worth a thousand words. These 100 examples are
just a sample of what you’ve been missing. We have models of more than
1,000 great stock market winners over the last 100 years. It takes only one or
two to make your year or your future. But you have to get serious and work
at really learning and knowing what you’re doing when you invest. You can
do it if you really want to.
You’ll probably find this a whole new way of looking at America and its
stock market. From the railroad to the auto and the airplane, from the radio
and TV to computers, from jet airliners to space exploration, from massive
discount stores to semiconductors and the Internet, this country has shown
rapid, unceasing growth. Living standards for the great majority of Americans
have improved materially from what they were 100, 50, or even 30 years ago.
Yes, there will always be problems, and everyone likes to criticize. But
America’s innovators, entrepreneurs, and inventors have been a major dri-
ving force behind its unparalleled growth. They have created the new indus-
tries, new technologies, new products, new services, and most of the jobs
from which we all have benefited.
Now it’s up to you to learn how to intelligently take advantage of the
relentless growth opportunities America’s freedom makes possible and that
entrepreneurs keep presenting for everyone during every business cycle.
In the following chapters, you will learn exactly how to pick big winners
in the stock market and nail down the gains they produce. You will also learn
how to substantially reduce your mistakes and losses.
Many people who dabble in stocks either have mediocre results or lose
money because of their lack of knowledge. But no one has to continue to
lose money. You can definitely learn to invest wisely. This book will provide
you with the investment understanding, skills, and methods you need if you
are to become a more successful investor.
I believe that most people in this country and throughout the free world,
whether they are young or old and regardless of their profession, education,
background, or economic position, should learn to save and invest in com-
mon stocks. This book isn’t written for the elite, but for the millions of ordi-
nary guys and gals everywhere who want a chance to be better off
financially. You are never too old or too young to start investing intelligently.
•
YOU CAN START SMALL—If you’re a typical working person or a beginning
investor, you should know that it doesn’t take a lot of money to start. You can
begin with as little as $500 to $1,000 and add to it as you earn and save more

money. I began with the purchase of just five shares of Procter & Gamble
when I was only 21 and fresh out of school.
Mike Webster is one of our in-house managers who also started small. In
fact, Mike sold personal belongings, including his music CD collection, to
raise cash for investing. Prior to managing money for the firm, he had a gain
of over 1,000% in his personal account in 1999, a very unusual year.
Steve Birch, another of our in-house money managers, started managing
money earlier. He took advantage of the roaring bull market of the late 1990s
and protected most of his gains by going mainly to cash in the bear market.
Between 1998 and 2003, he had gained over 1,300%. Both Mike and Steve
have had their rough years, but they’ve learned from their many mistakes,
which we all make, and gone on to achieve significant performance.
You live in a fantastic time of unlimited opportunity, an era of outstand-
ing new ideas, emerging industries, and new frontiers. However, you have to
read the rest of this book to learn how to recognize and take advantage of
these amazing new situations.
The opportunities are out there for everyone. You are now in a continu-
ally changing and, hopefully, improving New America. We lead the world in
high technology, the Internet, medical advancements, computer software,
military capability, and innovative new entrepreneurial companies. The
communist/socialist system and the concept of a centralized “command
economy” are now relegated to the ash heap of history. They did not work.
Our system of freedom and opportunity serves as a model of success for
most countries in the world.
Today it’s not enough for you to just work and earn a salary. To do the
things you want to do, go the places you want to go, and have the things you
want to have in your life, you absolutely must save and invest intelligently.
The income from your investments and the net gains you can make will let
you reach your goals and provide real security. This book can just change
your whole life. No one can hold you back but yourself.
•
SECRET TIP—The first step in learning how to pick big stock market winners
is to examine leaders of the past, like those you’re about to see, to learn the
characteristics of the most successful stocks. From these observations, you
will be able to recognize the types of price patterns these stocks developed
just before their spectacular price advances.
Other key factors you’ll discover include what the quarterly earnings of
these companies were at the time, what the annual earnings histories of
these organizations had been in the prior three years, what amount of trad-

Introduction
ing volume was present, what degree of relative strength there was in the
prices of the stocks before their enormous success, and how many shares of
common stock were outstanding in the capitalization of each company.
You’ll also learn many of the greatest winners had significant new prod-
ucts or new management, and many were tied to strong industry group
moves caused by important changes occurring in an entire industry.
It’s easy to conduct this type of practical, commonsense analysis of all past
successful leaders. I have already completed such a comprehensive study. In
our historical analysis, we selected the greatest winning stocks in the stock
market each year (in terms of percentage increase for the year), spanning
the past 125 years.
We call the study “The Model Book of Greatest Stock Market Winners.”
It’s been expanded recently to cover stocks dating back to the 1880s. It now
analyzes more than 1,000 of the biggest winning companies in recent mar-
ket history in detail, super stocks such as
Texas Instruments, whose price soared from $25 to $250 from January 1958
through May 1960
Xerox, which escalated from $160 to the equivalent of $1,340 between
March 1963 and June 1966
Syntex, which leaped from $100 to $570 in only six months during the last
half of 1963
Dome Petroleum and Prime Computer, which advanced 1,000% and
1,595%, respectively, in the 1978–1980 stock market
Limited Stores, which wildly excited lucky shareowners with a 3,500%
increase between 1982 and 1987
Cisco Systems, which between October 1990 and March 2000 advanced
from a split-adjusted $0.10 to $82
Home Depot and Microsoft both increased more than 20 times during
the 1980s and early 1990s. Home Depot was one of the all-time great per-
formers, jumping 20-fold in less than two years from its initial public offer-
ing in September 1981 and then climbing another 10 times from 1988 to
1992. All of these companies offered exciting new entrepreneurial products
and concepts. In total, we actually have 10 different model books that cover
America’s innovative and highly successful companies.
Would you like to know the common characteristics and rules of success
we discovered from this intensive study of all past stock market leaders?
They’re all covered in the next few chapters and in a simple, easy-to-
remember formula we have named CAN SLIM. Each letter in the words

A WINNING SYSTEM
CAN SLIM stands for one of the seven chief characteristics of these great-
est winning stocks at their early developing stages, just before they made
huge profits for their shareholders and our country (companies and employ-
ees all pay taxes as well as helping to improve our standard of living). Write
this formula down, and repeat it several times so you won’t forget it.
The reason CAN SLIM continues to work cycle after cycle is that it’s
based solely on the reality of how the stock market actually works rather
than on our personal opinion or anyone else’s, including Wall Street’s. Fur-
thermore, human nature at work in the market simply doesn’t change. So
CAN SLIM does not get outmoded as fads, fashions, and economic cycles
come and go. It will beat big egos and personal opinions every time.
You can definitely learn how to pick winners in the stock market, and you
can become part owner of the best companies in the world. So, let’s get
started right now. Here’s a sneak preview of CAN SLIM:
C Current Quarterly Earnings per Share: The Higher, the Better
A Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Significant Growth
N NewProducts,NewManagement,NewHighs:BuyingattheRightTime
S Supply and Demand: Shares Outstanding Plus Big Volume Demand
L Leader or Laggard: Which Is Your Stock?
I Institutional Sponsorship: Follow the Leaders
M Market Direction: How to Determine It

The Greatest Stock-Picking
Secrets
Right up front in this latest revised edition, you’ll see 100 charts of the greatest
winners from 1880 through 2008. Study them carefully. You’ll discover
secret insights into how these companies set the stage for their spectacular
price increases.
Don’t worry if you’re a new investor and don’t understand these charts at
first. After all, every successful investor was a beginner at some point—and
this book will show you how to spot key buying opportunities on the charts,
as well as critical signals that a stock should be sold. To succeed you need to
learn sound, historically proven buy rules plus sell rules.
As you study these charts you’ll see there are specific chart patterns that
are repeated over and over again whether in 1900 or 2000. This will give you
a huge advantage once you learn to recognize these patterns that in effect
tell you when a stock is under professional accumulation.
It is the unique combination of your finding stocks with big increases in
sales, earnings and return on equity plus strong chart patterns revealing
institutional buying that together will materially improve your stock selec-
tion and timing. The best professionals use charts.
You too can learn this valuable skill.
This book is about how America grows and you can too. The American
dream can be yours if you have the drive and desire and make up your mind
to never give up on yourself or America.

How to Read Charts
Like a Pro and Improve
Your Selection and Timing
In the world of medicine, X-rays, MRIs, and brain scans are “pictures” that doctors
study to help them diagnose what’s going on in the human body. EKGs and
ultrasound waves are recorded on paper or shown on TV-like monitors to
illustrate what’s happening to the human heart.
Similarly, maps are plotted and set to scale to help people understand
exactly where they are and how to get to where they want to go. And seismic
data are traced on charts to help geologists study which structures or pat-
terns seem most likely to contain oil.
In almost every field, there are tools available to help people evaluate
current conditions correctly and receive accurate information. The same is
true in investing. Economic indicators are plotted on graphs to assist in their
interpretation. A stock’s price and volume history are recorded on charts to
help investors determine whether the stock is strong, healthy, and under
accumulation or whether it’s weak and behaving abnormally.
Would you allow a doctor to open you up and perform heart surgery if he
had not utilized the critical necessary tools? Of course not. That would be
just plain irresponsible. However, many investors do exactly that when they
buy and sell stocks without first consulting stock charts. Just as doctors
would be irresponsible not to use X-rays, CAT scans, and EKGs on their
patients, investors are just plain foolish if they don’t learn to interpret the
price and volume patterns found on stock charts. If nothing else, charts can
tell you when a stock is not acting right and should be sold.
Individual investors can lose a lot of money if they don’t know how to rec-
ognize when a stock tops and starts into a significant correction or if they
have been depending on someone else who also doesn’t know this.

How to Read Charts Like a Pro and Improve Your Selection and Timing
Chart Reading Basics
Charts record the factual price performance of thousands of stocks. Price
changes are the result of daily supply and demand in the largest auction
marketplace in the world. Investors who train themselves to decode price
movements on charts properly have an enormous advantage over those who
either refuse to learn, just don’t know any better, or are a bit lazy.
Would you fly in a plane without instruments or take a long cross-country
trip in your car without a road map? Charts are your investment road map.
In fact, the distinguished economists Milton and Rose Friedman devoted
the first 28 pages of their excellent book Free to Choose to the power of
market facts and the unique ability of prices to provide important and accu-
rate information to decision makers.
Chart patterns, or “bases,” are simply areas of price correction and con-
solidation after an earlier price advance. Most of them (80% to 90%) are
created and formed as a result of corrections in the general market. The skill
you need to learn in order to analyze these bases is how to diagnose whether
the price and volume movements are normal or abnormal. Do they signal
strength or weakness?
Major advances occur off strong, recognizable price patterns (discussed
later in this chapter). Failures can always be traced to bases that are faulty
or too obvious to the typical investor.
Fortunes are made every year by those who take the time to learn to inter-
pret charts properly. Professionals who don’t make use of charts are confess-
ing their ignorance of highly valuable measurement and timing mechanisms.
To further emphasize this point: I have seen many high-level investment pro-
fessionals ultimately lose their jobs as a result of weak performance.
When this happens, their poor records are often a direct result of not
knowing very much about market action and chart reading. Universities that
teach finance or investment courses and dismiss charts as irrelevant or
unimportant are demonstrating their complete lack of knowledge and
understanding of how the market really works and how the best profession-
als operate.
As an individual investor, you too need to study and benefit from stock
charts. It’s not enough to buy a stock simply because it has good fundamen-
tal characteristics, like strong earnings and sales. In fact, no Investor’s Busi-
ness Daily®reader should ever buy a stock based solely on IBD’s proprietary
SmartSelect®Ratings. A stock’s chart must always be checked to determine
whether the stock is in a proper position to buy, or whether it is the stock of
a sound, leading company but is too far extended in price above a solid bas-
ing area and thus should temporarily be avoided.

A WINNING SYSTEM
As the number of investors in the market has increased over recent years,
simple price and volume charts have become more readily available.
(Investor’s Business Daily subscribers have free access to 10,000 daily and
weekly charts on the Web at investors.com.) Chart books and online chart
services can help you follow hundreds and even thousands of stocks in a
highly organized, time-saving way. Some are more advanced than others,
offering both fundamental and technical data in addition to price and volume
movement. Subscribe to one of the better chart services, and you’ll have at
your fingertips valuable information that is not easily available elsewhere.
History Repeats Itself: Learn to Use Historical Precedents
As mentioned in the introduction, and as shown on the annotated charts of
history’s best winners in Chapter 1, our system for selecting winning stocks
is based on how the market actually operates, not on my or anyone else’s
personal opinions or academic theories. We analyzed the greatest winning
stocks of the past and discovered they all had seven common characteristics,
which can be summarized in the two easy-to-remember words CAN SLIM.
We also discovered there were a number of successful price patterns and
consolidation structures that repeated themselves over and over again. In
the stock market, history repeats itself. This is because human nature does-
n’t change. Neither does the law of supply and demand. Price patterns of
the great stocks of the past can clearly serve as models for your future selec-
tions. There are several price patterns you’ll want to look for when you’re
analyzing a stock for purchase. I’ll also go over some signals to watch out for
that indicate that a price pattern may be faulty and unsound.
The Most Common Chart Pattern: “Cup with Handle”
One of the most important price patterns looks like a cup with a handle when
the outline of the cup is viewed from the side. Cup patterns can last from 7
weeks to as long as 65 weeks, but most of them last for three to six months.
The usual correction from the absolute peak (the top of the cup) to the low
point (the bottom of the cup) of this price pattern varies from around the
12% to 15% range to upwards of 33%. A strong price pattern of any type
should always have a clear and definite price uptrend prior to the beginning
of its base pattern. You should look for at least a 30% increase in price in the
prior uptrend, together with improving relative strength and a very substan-
tial increase in trading volume at some points in the prior uptrend.
In most, but not all, cases, the bottom part of the cup should be rounded
and give the appearance of a “U” rather than a very narrow “V.” This char-

Higggh of handle
pivot
Base length
acteristic allows the stock time to proceed through a needed natural correc-
tion, with two or three final little weak spells around the lows of the cup.
The “U” area is important because it scares out or wears out the remaining
weak holders and takes other speculators’ attention away from the stock. A
more solid foundation of strong owners who are much less apt to sell during
the next advance is thereby established. The accompanying chart from
Daily Graphs Online® shows the daily price and volume movements for
Apple Computer in February 2004.
It’s normal for growth stocks to create cup patterns during intermediate
declines in the general market and to correct 1½ to 2½ times the market
averages. Your best choices are generally stocks with base patterns that
deteriorate the least during an intermediate market decline. Whether
you’re in a bull market or a bear market, stock downturns that exceed 2½
times the market averages are usually too wide and loose and must be
regarded with suspicion. Dozens of former high-tech leaders, such as JDS
Uniphase, formed wide, loose, and deep cup patterns in the second and
third quarters of 2000. These were almost all faulty, failure-prone patterns
signaling that the stocks should have been avoided when they attempted to
break out to new highs.
A very small number of volatile leaders can plunge by as much as 40%
or 50% in a bull market. Chart patterns that correct by more than this
amount during bull markets have a higher rate of failure if they try to
make new price highs and resume their advance. The reason? A down-
swing of over 50% from a peak to a low means that the stock must increase
more than 100% from its low to get back to its old high. Historical
research has shown that stocks that make new price highs after such huge
moves tend to fail 5% to 15% beyond their breakout prices. Stocks that
come straight off the bottom into new highs off cups can be more risky
because they had no pullbacks.

A WINNING SYSTEM
the next 101 weeks. This stock, with its 54% earnings growth rate and its lat-
est quarterly results up 192%, was one of several classic cup-with-handle
stocks that I presented to Fidelity Research & Management in Boston dur-
ing a monthly meeting in early June 1975. Upon seeing such big numbers,
one of the portfolio managers was instantly interested.
As you can see by this example, some patterns that have corrected 50% to
60% or more coming out of an intermediate bull market decline or a major
bear market can succeed. (See the charts for Sea Containers and The Lim-
ited.) In these cases, the percent of decline is a function of the severity of
the general market decline and the tremendous extent of the stock’s prior
price run-up.
Basic Characteristics of a Cup’s Handle Area
The formation of the handle area generally takes more than one or two
weeks and has a downward price drift or “shakeout” (where the price drops
below a prior low point in the handle made a few weeks earlier), usually
near the end of its down-drifting price movement. Volume may dry up
noticeably near the lows in the handle’s price pullback phase. During a bull
market, volume in the majority of cases should not pick up during a correc-
tion in the handle, although there have been some exceptions.
Although cups without handles have a somewhat higher failure rate,
many stocks can advance successfully without forming a handle. Also, some
of the more volatile technology names in 1999 formed handles of only one
or two weeks before they began their major price advances.
When handles do occur, they almost always form in the upper half of the
overall base structure, as measured from the absolute peak of the entire
base to the absolute low of the cup. The handle should also be above the
stock’s 10-week moving average price line. Handles that form in the lower
half of an overall base or completely below the stock’s 10-week line are weak
and failure-prone. Demand up to that point has not been strong enough to
enable the stock to recover more than half its prior decline.
Additionally, handles that consistently wedge up (drift upward along their
price lows or just go straight sideways along their lows rather than drifting
down) have a much higher probability of failing when they break out to new
highs. This upward-wedging behavior along low points in the handle does-
n’t let the stock undergo the needed shakeout or sharp price pullback after
having advanced from the low of the base into the upper half of the pattern.
This high-risk trait tends to occur in third- or fourth-stage bases, in laggard
stock bases, or in very active market leaders that become too widely fol-
lowed and therefore too obvious. You should beware of wedging handles.
A price drop in a proper handle should be contained within 8% to 12%
of its peak during bull markets unless the stock forms a very large cup, as in

the rather unusual case of Sea Containers in 1975. Downturns in handles
that exceed this percentage during bull markets look wide and erratic and
in most cases are improper and risky. However, if you’re in the last shake-
out area of a bear market bottom, the unusual general market weakness
will cause some handle areas to quickly decline around 20% to 30%, but
the price pattern can still be sound if the general market then follows
through on the upside, creating a new major uptrend. (See Chapter 9,
“M = Market Direction.”)
Constructive Patterns Have Tight Price Areas
There should also be at least some tight areas in the price patterns of
stocks under accumulation. On a weekly chart, tightness is defined as
small price variations from high to low for the week, with several consec-
utive weeks’ prices closing unchanged or remarkably near the previous
week’s close. If the base pattern has a wide spread between the week’s
high and low points every week, it’s been constantly in the market’s eye
and frequently will not succeed when it breaks out. However, amateur
chartists typically will not notice the difference, and the stock can run up
5% to 15%, drawing in less-discriminating traders, before it breaks badly
and fails.
Find Pivot Points and Watch “Volume Percent Change”
When a stock forms a proper cup-with-handle chart pattern and then
charges through an upside buy point, which Jesse Livermore referred to as
the “pivot point” or “line of least resistance,” the day’s volume should
increase at least 40% to 50% above normal. During major breakouts, it’s not
uncommon for new market leaders to show volume spikes 200%, 500%, or
1,000% greater than the average daily volume. In almost all cases, it’s pro-
fessional institutional buying that causes the big, above-average volume
increases in the better-priced, better-quality growth-oriented stocks at pivot
breakouts. A full 95 percent of the general public is usually afraid to buy at
such points because it’s scary and it seems risky and rather absurd to buy
stocks at their highest prices.
Your objective isn’t to buy at the cheapest price or near the low, but to
begin buying at exactly the right time, when your chances for success are
greatest. This means that you have to learn to wait for a stock to move up
and trade at your buy point before you make an initial commitment. If you
work and cannot watch the market constantly, small quote devices or quotes
available on cell phones and Web sites will help you stay on top of potential
breakout points.

A WINNING SYSTEM
The winning individual investor waits to buy at these precise pivot points.
This is where the real move generally starts and all the exciting action
begins. If you try to buy before this point, you may be premature. In many
cases the stock will never get to its breakout point, but rather will stall or
actually decrease in price. You want a stock to prove its strength to you
before you invest in it. Also, if you buy at more than 5% to 10% past the pre-
cise buy point, you are buying late and will more than likely get caught in
the next price correction. Your automatic 8% loss-cutting rule (see Chapter
10, “When You Must Sell and Cut Every Loss . . . Without Exception”) will
then force you to sell because the stock was extended in price and didn’t
have enough room to go through a perfectly normal sharp but minor cor-
rection. So don’t get into the bad habit of chasing stocks up too high.
Pivot buy points in correct chart base patterns are not typically based on a
stock’s old high price. Most of them occur at 5% to 10% below the prior peak.
The peak price in the handle area is what determines most buy points, and
this is almost always somewhat below the base’s actual high. This is very
important to remember. If you wait for an actual new high price, you will
often buy too late. Sometimes you can get a slight head start by drawing a
downtrend line from the overall pattern’s absolute peak downward across the
peak where the stock begins building the handle. Then begin your purchase
when the trend line is broken on the upside a few weeks later. However, you
have to be right in your chart and stock analysis to get away with this.
Look for Volume Dry-Ups Near the Lows of a Price Pattern
Nearly all proper bases will show a dramatic drying up of volume for one or
two weeks along the very low of the base pattern and in the low area or few
last weeks of the handle. This means that all of the selling has been
exhausted and there is very little stock coming into the marketplace.
Healthy stocks that are under accumulation almost always show this symp-
tom. The combination of tightness in prices (daily or weekly price closes
being very near each other) and dried-up volume at key points is generally
quite constructive.
Big Volume Clues Are Valuable
Another clue that is valuable to the trained chart specialist is the occurrence
of big daily and weekly volume spikes. Microsoft is an example of an out-
standing stock that flashed heavy accumulation just before a huge run-up.
Weeks of advancing prices on heavy volume, followed in other weeks by
extreme volume dry-ups, are also a very constructive sign. If you use a Daily

Graphs Online chart service in conjunction with the weekly graphs, you’ll be
able to see unusual trading activity that sometimes happens on only one day.
The day Microsoft broke out at its 31½ buy point, its volume was 545%
above average, signaling really important institutional buying. It then had a
13-year bull run from a split-adjusted 10 cents to $53.98. How’s that for a
big percentage move?
Volume is a remarkable subject that is worthy of careful study. It can help
you recognize whether a stock is under accumulation (institutional buying)
or distribution (institutional selling). Once you acquire this skill, you won’t
have to rely on the personal opinions of analysts and supposed experts. Big
volume at certain key points is indispensable.
Volume is your best measure of supply and demand and institutional
sponsorship—two vital ingredients in successful stock analysis. Learn how
to use charts to time your purchases correctly. Making buys at the wrong
time or, worse, buying stocks that are not under accumulation or that have
unsound, faulty price patterns is simply too costly.
The next time you consider buying a stock, check its weekly volume. It’s usu-
ally a constructive sign when the number of weeks that the stock closes up in
price on above-average weekly volume outnumbers the number of weeks that
it closes down in price on above-average volume while still in its chart base.
A Few Normal-Size Cups with Handles
Texas Instruments, Apple, General Cable, and Precision Castparts were all
similar-size patterns in length and depth. Can you recognize the similarity
between Apple and Precision Castparts? As you learn to do this with greater
skill, you will in the future be able to spot many cup with handles just like
these past winners.

A WINNING SYSTEM
The Value of Market Corrections
Since 80% to 90% percent of price patterns are created during periods of
market corrections, you should never get discouraged and give up on the
stock market’s potential during intermediate-term sell-offs or short or pro-
longed bear markets. America always comes back because of its inventors
and entrepreneurs and the total freedom and unlimited opportunity that do
not exist in communist or dictator-controlled countries.
Bear markets can last as little as three, six, or nine months or as long as
two or, in very rare cases, three years. If you follow the sell rules in this book
carefully, you will sell and nail down most of your profits, cut short any
losses, raise significant cash, and move off margin (borrowed money) in the
early stages of each new bear market (see the success stories at the end of
the book).
In fact, Investor’s Business Dailyconducted four surveys in late 2008 that
indicated that about 60% of IBD subscribers used our rules to sell and raise
cash in December 2007 or June 2008 and thereby preserved most of their
capital prior to the more serious decline in late 2008 that resulted from the
subprime loan debacle.
Even if you sell out completely and move to cash, you never want to
throw in the towel on stock investing because bear markets create new bases
in new stocks, some of which could be the next cycle’s 1,000% winners. You
don’t foolishly give up while the greatest opportunities of a lifetime are set-
ting up and may sooner or later be just around the corner.
A bear market is the time to do a postanalysis of your prior decisions. Plot
on daily or weekly charts exactly where you bought and sold all the stocks
you traded in the past year. Study your decisions and write out some new
rules that will let you avoid the mistakes you made in the past cycle. Then
study several of the biggest winners that you missed or mishandled.
Develop some rules to make sure that you buy the real leaders and handle
them right in the next bull market cycle. They will be there, and this is the
time to be watching for them as they begin to form bases. The question is
whether you will be there with a carefully thought-through game plan to
totally capitalize on them.
Other Price Patterns to Look For
How to Spot a “Saucer-with-Handle” Price Pattern
A “saucer with handle” is a price pattern similar to the cup with handle except
that the saucer part tends to stretch out over a longer period of time, making
the pattern shallower. (If the names “cup with handle” and “saucer with han-
dle” sound unusual, consider that for years you have recognized and called

Eckerd in April 1967 was an example of the saucer-with-handle base.
Recognizing a “Double-Bottom” Price Pattern
A “double-bottom” price pattern looks like the letter “W.” This pattern also
doesn’t occur quite as often as the cup with handle, but it still occurs fre-
quently. It is usually important that the second bottom of the W match the
price level (low) of the first bottom or, as in almost all cases, clearly undercut
it by one or two points, thereby creating a shakeout of weaker investors. Fail-

ure to undercut may create a faulty, more failure-prone “almost” double bot-
tom. Double bottoms may also have handles, although this is not essential.
The depth and horizontal length of a double bottom are similar to those
of the cup formation. The pivot buy point in a double bottom is located on
the top right side of the W, where the stock is coming up after the second
leg down. The pivot point should be equal in price to the top of the middle
peak of the W, which should stop somewhere a little below the pattern’s
peak price. If the double bottom has a handle, then the peak price of the
handle determines the pivot buy point. See the accompanying charts for
Dome Petroleum, Price Co. and Cisco Systems for outstanding examples
of double-bottom price patterns found during 1977, 1982, and 1990. Some
later examples are EMC, NVR, and eBay.
For double-bottom patterns, the following symbols apply: A = beginning
of base; B = bottom of first leg; C = middle of W that sets the buy point; D =
bottom of second leg. If the double-bottom pattern has a handle, then E =
top of the handle (sets the buy point) and F = bottom of the handle.

Definition of a “Flat-Base” Price Structure
A flat base is another rewarding price structure. It is usually a second-stage
base that occurs after a stock has advanced 20% or more off a cup with han-
dle, saucer with handle, or double bottom. The flat base moves straight side-
ways in a fairly tight price range for at least five or six weeks, and it does not
correct more than 10% to 15%. Standard Oil of Ohio in May 1979, Smith-
Kline in March 1978, and Dollar General in 1982 are good examples of flat

bases. Pep Boys in March 1981 formed a longer flat base. If you miss a
stock’s initial breakout from a cup with handle, you should keep your eye on
it. In time it may form a flat base and give you a second opportunity to get
on board. Here are a few more recent examples: Surgical Care Affiliates,
CB Richard Ellis, and Deckers Outdoor.
Here’s a New Base We’ve Dubbed a Square Box
After moving up from a cup with handle or double bottom, this formation
typically lasts from four to seven weeks; doesn’t correct too much, usually
only 10% to 15%; and has a square, boxy look. I’ve noted this over recent
years, but finally we’ve studied, measured, and classified it. Here are some
examples: Lorillard, Korvette, Texas Instruments, Home Depot, Dell, and
Taro.

High, Tight Flags Are Rare
A “high, tight flag” price pattern is rare, occurring in no more than a few
stocks during a bull market. It begins with the stock moving generally 100%
to 120% in a very short period of time (four to eight weeks). It then corrects
sideways no more than 10% to 25%, usually in three, four, or five weeks.
This is the strongest of patterns, but it’s also very risky and difficult to inter-
pret correctly. Many stocks can skyrocket 200% or more off this formation. (See
the charts for Bethlehem Steel, May 1915; American Chain & Cable, October
1935; E. L. Bruce, June 1958; Zenith, October 1958; Universal Controls,
November 1958; Certain-teed, January 1961; Syntex, July 1963; Rollins, July
1964; Simmonds Precision, November 1965; Accustaff, January 1995; Emulex,
October 1999; JDS Uniphase, October 1999; Qualcomm, December 1999;
Taser International, November 2003; and Google, September 2004. Each ear-
lier pattern serves as a precedent for each later pattern, so study them carefully.

The E. L. Bruce pattern in the second quarter of 1958, at around $50,
provided a perfect chart pattern precedent for the Certain-teed advance
that occurred in 1961. Certain-teed, in turn, became the chart model that I
used to buy my first super winner, Syntex, in July 1963.
What Is a Base on Top of a Base?
During the latter stages of a bear market, a seemingly negative condition
flags what may be aggressive new leadership in the new bull phase. I call this
unusual case a “base on top of a base.”
What happens is that a powerful stock breaks out of its base and
advances, but is unable to increase a normal 20% to 30% because the gen-
eral market begins another leg down. The stock therefore pulls back in price
and builds a second back-and-forth price consolidation area just on top of its
previous base while the general market averages keep making new lows.
When the bearish phase in the overall market ends, as it always does at
some point, this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en
route to a huge gain. It’s like a spring that is being held down by the pressure
of a heavy object. Once the object (in this case, a bear market) is removed,
the spring is free to do what it wanted to do all along. This is another exam-
ple of why it’s foolhardy to get upset and emotional with the market or lose
your confidence. The next big race could be just a few months away.
Two of our institutional services firm’s best ideas in 1978—M/A-Com and
Boeing—showed base-on-top-of-a-base patterns. One advanced 180%, the
other 950%. Ascend Communications and Oracle were other examples of a
base on top of a base. After breaking out at the bear market bottom of
December 1994, Ascend bolted almost 1,500% in 17 months. Oracle
repeated the same base-on-base pattern in October 1999 and zoomed nearly
300%. Coming out of the Depression in 1934, Coca-Cola did the same thing.

Ascending Bases
Ascending bases, like flat bases, occur midway along a move up after a stock
has broken out of a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base. They have
three pullbacks of from 10% to 20%, with each low point during the sell-off
in price being higher than the preceding one, which is why I call them
ascending bases.
Each of the pullbacks usually occurs because the general market is
declining at that time.
Boeing formed a 13-week ascending base in the second quarter of 1954
and then doubled in price. Redman Industries, a builder of mobile homes,
had an 11-week ascending base in the first quarter of 1968 and proceeded
to increase 500% in just 37 weeks. America Online created the same type of
base in the first quarter of 1999 and resumed what turned out to be a 500%
run-up from the breakout of a 14-week cup with handle in October 1998.
So you see, history does repeat itself. The more historical patterns you
know and come to recognize, the more money you should be able to make
in future markets. (See the chart examples in Chapter 1, and also Simmonds
Precision, Monogram Industries, Redman Industries, America Online, and
Titanium Metals.

Wide-and-Loose Price Structures Are Failure Prone
Wide-and-loose-looking charts usually fail but can tighten up later. New
England Nuclear and Houston Oil & Minerals are two cases of stocks that
tightened up following wide, loose, and erratic price movements. I cite
them because I missed both of them at the time. It’s always wise to review
big winners that you missed to find out why you didn’t recognize them when
they were exactly right and ready to soar.
New England Nuclear formed a wide, loose, and faulty price pattern that
looked like a double bottom from points A, B, C, D, and E. It declined
about 40% from the beginning at point A to point D. That was excessive,
and it took too much time—almost six months—to hit bottom. Note the
additional clue provided by the declining trend of its relative strength line
(RS) throughout the faulty pattern. Buying at point E was wrong. The han-
dle was also too short and did not drift down to create a shakeout. It wedged
up along its low points.
New England Nuclear then formed a second base from points E to F to
G. But if you tried to buy at point G, you were wrong again. It was prema-
ture because the price pattern was still wide and loose. The move from point
E to point F was a prolonged decline, with relative strength deteriorating
badly. The rise straight up from the bottom at point F to the bogus breakout
point G was too fast and erratic, taking only three months. Three months of
improving relative strength versus the prior 17 months of decline weren’t
enough to turn the previous poor trend into a positive one.
The stock then declined from point G to point H to form what appeared
to be a handle area for the possible cup formation from points E to F to G. If
you bought at point I on the breakout attempt, the stock failed again. Reason:
the handle was too loose; it degenerated 20%. However, after failing that

A WINNING SYSTEM
time, the stock at last tightened up its price structure from points I to J to K,
and 15 weeks later, at point K, it broke out of a tight, sound base and nearly
tripled in price afterwards. Note the stock’s strong uptrend and materially
improved relative strength line for 11 months from point K back to point F.
So, there really is a right time and a wrong time to buy a stock, but under-
standing the difference requires some study. There’s no such thing as being
an overnight success in the stock market, and success has nothing to do with
listening to tips from other people or being lucky. You have to study and pre-
pare yourself so that you can become successful on your own with your
investing. So make yourself more knowledgeable. It isn’t easy at first, but it
can be very rewarding. Anyone can learn to do it. You can do it. Believe in
your ability to learn. Unlearn past assumptions that didn’t work.
Here are some faulty wide-and-loose patterns that faked people into buy-
ing during the prolonged bear market that began in March 2000: Veritas

The aforementioned Houston Oil & Minerals is an even more dramatic
example of the handle correction from point F to point G being a wide-and-
loose pattern that later tightened up into a constructive price formation (see the
accompanying chart). A to B to C was extremely wide, loose, and erratic (the
percent decline was too great). B to C was straight up from the bottom without
any pullback in price. Points C and D were false attempts to break out of a faulty
price pattern, and so was point H, which tried to break out of a wide-and-loose
cup with handle. Afterward, a tight nine-week base formed from points H to I
to J. (Note the extreme volume dry-up along the December 1975 lows.)
An alert stockbroker in Hartford, Connecticut, called this structure to my
attention. However, I’d been so conditioned by the two prior years of poor
price patterns and less-than-desirable earnings that my mind was slow to
change when the stock suddenly altered its behavior in only nine weeks. I
was probably also intimidated by the tremendous price increase that had
occurred in Houston Oil in the earlier 1973 bull market. This proves that
opinions and feelings are frequently wrong, but markets rarely are.
It also points out a very important principle: it takes time for all of us to
change opinions that we have built up over a substantial period. In this
instance, even the current quarterly earnings turning up 357% after three
down quarters didn’t change my incorrect bearish view of the stock to a
bullish one. The right buy point was in January 1976.
In August 1994, PeopleSoft repeated the New England Nuclear and Hous-
ton Oil patterns. It failed in its breakout attempt from a wide, loose, wedging-
upward pattern in September 1993. It then failed a second time in its
breakout attempt in March 1994, when its handle area formed in the lower

A WINNING SYSTEM
half of its cup-with-handle pattern. Finally, when the chart pattern and the
general market were right, PeopleSoft skyrocketed starting in August 1994.
In the first week of January 1999, San Diego–based Qualcomm followed
PeopleSoft’s three-phased precedent. In October 1997, Qualcomm charged
into new-high ground straight up from a loose, faulty base with too much of
its base in its lower half. It then built a second faulty base, broke out of a
handle in the lower part, and failed. The third base was the charm: a prop-
erly formed cup with handle that worked in the first week in January 1999.
Qualcomm went straight through the roof from a split-adjusted $7.50 to
$200 in only one year. Maybe you should spend more time studying histori-
cal precedents. What do you think? If you had invested $7,500 in Qual-
comm, a year later it would have been worth $200,000.
Detecting Faulty Price Patterns and Base Structures
Unfortunately, no original or thorough research on price pattern analysis
has been done in the last 78 years. In 1930, Richard Schabacker, a financial
editor of Forbes, wrote a book, Stock Market Theory and Practice. In it he
discussed many patterns, including triangles, coils, and pennants. Our
detailed model building and investigations of price structure over the years
have shown these patterns to be unreliable and risky. They probably worked
in the latter part of the “Roaring ’20s,” when most stocks ran up in a wild,
climactic frenzy. Something similar happened in 1999 and the first quarter
of 2000, when many loose, faulty patterns at first seemed to work, but then
failed. These periods were just like the Dutch tulip bulb craze of the seven-
teenth century, during which rampant speculation caused varieties of tulip
bulbs to skyrocket to astronomical prices and then crash.
Our studies show that, with the exception of high, tight flags, which are
extremely rare and hard to interpret, flat bases of five or six weeks, and the
square box of four to seven weeks, the most reliable base patterns must have
a minimum of seven to eight weeks of price consolidation. Most coils, trian-
gles, and pennants are simply weak foundations without sufficient time or
price correction to become proper bases. One-, two-, and three-week bases
are risky. In almost all cases, they should be avoided.
In 1948, John McGee and Robert D. Edwards wrote Technical Analysis
of Stock Trends, a book that discusses many of the same faulty patterns pre-
sented in Schabacker’s earlier work.
In 1962, William Jiler wrote an easy-to-read book, How Charts Can Help
You in the Stock Market, that explains many of the correct principles behind
technical analysis. However, it too seems to have continued the display and
discussion of certain failure-prone patterns of the pre-Depression era.

A WINNING SYSTEM
Triple bottoms and head-and-shoulders bottoms are patterns that are
widely mentioned in several books on technical analysis. We have found
these to be weaker patterns as well. A head-and-shoulders bottom may suc-
ceed in a few instances, but it has no strong prior uptrend, which is essential
for most powerful market leaders.
When it comes to signifying a top in a stock, however, head-and-shoul-
ders top patterns are among the most reliable. Be careful: if you have only a
little knowledge of charts, you can misinterpret what is a correct head-and-
shoulders top. Many pros don’t interpret the pattern properly. The right
(second) shoulder must be slightly below the left shoulder (see the chart for
Alexander & Alexander).

A triple bottom is a looser, weaker, and less-attractive base pattern than a
double bottom. The reason is that the stock corrects and falls back sharply
to its absolute low three times rather than twice, as with a double bottom, or
once, as in the strong cup with handle. As mentioned earlier, a cup with a
wedging handle is also usually a faulty, failure-prone pattern, as you can see
in the Global Crossing Ltd. chart example. A competent chart reader would
have avoided or sold Global Crossing, which later went bankrupt.
How to Use Relative Price Strength Correctly
Many fundamental securities analysts think that technical analysis means
buying those stocks with the strongest relative price strength. Others think
that technical research refers only to the buying of “high-momentum”
stocks. Both views are incorrect.
It’s not enough to just buy stocks that show the highest relative price
strength on some list of best performers. You should buy stocks that are per-

forming better than the general market just as they are beginning to emerge
from sound base-building periods. The time to sell is when the stock has
advanced rapidly, is extended materially from its base, and is showing
extremely high relative price strength. To recognize the difference, you
have to use daily or weekly charts.
What Is Overhead Supply?
A critically important concept to learn in analyzing price movements is the
principle of overhead supply. Overhead supply is when there are significant
areas of price resistance in a stock as it moves up after experiencing a
downtrend.
These areas of resistance represent prior purchases of a stock and serve
to limit and frustrate its upward movement because the investors who made
these purchases are motivated to sell when the price returns to their entry
point. (See the chart for At Home.) For example, if a stock advances from
$25 to $40, then declines back to $30, most of the people who bought it in
the upper $30s and at $40 will have a loss in the stock unless they were quick
to sell and cut their loss (which most people don’t do). If the stock later
climbs back to the high $30s or $40 area, the investors who had losses can
now get out and break even.
These are the holders who promised themselves: “If I can just get out
even, I will sell.” Human nature doesn’t change. So it’s normal for a number
of these people to sell when they see a chance to get their money back after
having been down a large amount.
Good chartists know how to recognize the price zones that represent
heavy areas of overhead supply. They will never make the fatal mistake of

buying a stock that has a large amount of recent overhead supply. This is a
serious mistake that many analysts who are concerned solely with funda-
mentals sometimes make.
A stock that’s able to fight its way through its overhead supply, however,
may be safer to buy, even though the price is a little higher. It has proved to
have sufficient demand to absorb the supply and move past its level of resis-
tance. Supply areas more than two years old create less resistance. Of
course, a stock that has just broken out into new high ground for the first
time has no overhead supply to contend with, which adds to its appeal.
Excellent Opportunities in Unfamiliar, Newer Stocks
Alert investors should have a way of keeping track of all the new stock issues that
have emerged over the last 10 years. This is important because some of these
newer and younger companies will be among the most stunning performers of
the next year or two. Most of these issues trade on the Nasdaq market.
Some new issues move up a small amount and then retreat to new price
lows during a bear market, making a poor initial impression. But when the
next bull market begins, a few of these forgotten newcomers will sneak back
up unnoticed, form base patterns, and suddenly take off and double or triple
in price if they have earnings and sales that are good and improving.
Most investors miss these outstanding price moves because they occur in
new names that are largely unknown to most people. A charting service can
help you spot these unfamiliar, newer companies, but make sure that your
service follows a large number of stocks (not just one or two thousand).
Successful, young growth stocks tend to enjoy their fastest earnings
growth between their fifth and tenth years in business, so keep an eye on
them during their early growth periods.

How to Read Charts Like a Pro and Improve Your Selection and Timing
To summarize, improve your stock selection and overall portfolio perfor-
mance by learning to read and use charts. They provide a gold mine of infor-
mation. It will take some time and study on your part to become good at
this, but interpreting charts is easier than you think.

A Loud Warning to the Wise about Bear Markets!!!
Let me offer one last bit of judicious guidance. If you are new to the stock mar-
ket or the historically tested and proven strategies outlined in this book, or,
more importantly, if you are reading this book for the first time near the begin-
ning or middle of a bear market, do not expect the presumed buy patterns to
work. Most of them will definitely be defective. You absolutely do not buy break-
outs during a bear market. Most of them will fail.
The price patterns will be too deep, wide, and loose in appearance com-
pared to earlier patterns. They will be third- and fourth-stage bases; have
wedging or loose, sloppy handles; have handles in the lower half of the base;
or show narrow “V” formations moving straight up from the bottom of a base
into new highs, without any handle forming. Some patterns may show laggard
stocks with declining relative strength lines and price patterns with too much
adverse volume activity or every week’s price spread wide.
It isn’t that bases, breakouts, or the method isn’t working anymore; it’s that
the timing and the stocks are simply all wrong. The price and volume patterns
are phony, faulty, and unsound. The general market is turning negative. It is
selling time. Be patient, keep studying, and be 100% prepared. Later, at the
least expected time, when all the news is terrible, winter will ultimately pass
and a great new bull market will suddenly spring to life. The practical tech-
niques and proven disciplines discussed here should work for you for many,
many future economic cycles. So get prepared and do your homework. Create
your own buy and sell rules that you will constantly use.

posting gains of 1,780%, 1,467%, and 557%, respectively?
Or for that matter, what about Google, which started trading at $85 a
share in August 2004 and didn’t stop climbing until it peaked at over $700 in
2007? Or Apple, which had emerged from a perfect cup-with-handle pat-
tern six months earlier at a split-adjusted $12 a share and reached $202 in 45
months?
What key traits, among the hundreds that can move stocks up and down,
did these companies all have in common?
These are not idle questions. The answers unlock the secret to true suc-
cess in the stock market. Our study of all the stock market superstars from
the last century and a quarter found that they did indeed share common
characteristics.
None of these characteristics, however, stood out as boldly as the profits
each big winner reported in the latest quarter or two before its major price
advance. For example:
• Dell’s earnings per share surged 74% and 108% in the two quarters prior
to its price increase from November 1996.
• Cisco posted earnings gains of 150% and 155% in the two quarters end-
ing October 1990, prior to its giant run-up over the next three years.
• America Online’s earnings were up 900% and 283% before its six-month
burst from October 1998.

• Google showed earnings gains of 112% and 123% in the two quarters
before it made its spectacular debut as a public company.
• Apple’s earnings were up 350% in the quarter before it took off, and its
next quarter was up another 300%.
But this isn’t just a recent phenomenon. Explosive earnings have accom-
panied big stock moves throughout the stock market’s great history in Amer-
ica. Studebaker’s earnings were up 296% before it sped from $45 to $190 in
eight months in 1914, and Cuban American Sugar’s earnings soared 1,175%
in 1916, the same year its stock climbed from $35 to $230.
In the summer of 1919, Stutz Motor Car was showing an earnings gain of
70% before the prestigious manufacturer of high-performance sports
cars—you remember the Bearcat, don’t you?—raced from $75 to $385 in
just 40 weeks.
Earnings at U.S. Cast Iron Pipe rose from $1.51 a share at the end of
1922 to $21.92 at the end of 1923, an increase of 1,352%. In late 1923, the
stock traded at $30; by early 1925, it went for $250.
And in March of 1926, du Pont de Nemours showed earnings up 259%
before its stock took off from $41 that July and got to $230 before the 1929
break.
In fact, if you look down a list of the market’s biggest winners year-in and
year-out, you’ll instantly see the relationship between booming profits and
booming stocks.
And you’ll see why our studies have concluded that
The stocks you select should show a major percentage increase in current
quarterly earnings per share (the most recently reported quarter)
when compared to the prior year’s same quarter.
Seek Stocks Showing Huge Current Earnings Increases
In our models of the 600 best-performing stocks from 1952 to 2001, three
out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the lat-
est publicly reported quarter beforethey began their major advances. Those
that did not show solid current quarterly earnings increases did so in the
very next quarter, with an average earnings increase of 90%!
Priceline.com was showing earnings up “only” 34% in the June quarter of
2006, when its stock began a move from $30 to $140. But its earnings accel-
erated, rising 53%, 107%, and 126%, in the quarters that followed.
From 1910 to 1950, most of the very best performers showed earnings
gains ranging from 40% to 400% before their big price moves.

A WINNING SYSTEM
So, if the best stocks had profit increases of this magnitude before they
advanced rapidly in price, why should you settle for anything less? You may
find that only 2% of all stocks listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock
Exchange will show earnings gains of this size. But remember: you’re looking
for stocks that are exceptional, not lackluster. Don’t worry; they’re out there.
As with any search, however, there can be traps and pitfalls along the
way, and you need to know how to avoid them.
The earnings per share (EPS) number you want to focus on is calculated
by dividing a company’s total after-tax profits by the number of common
shares outstanding. This percentage change in EPS is the single most
important element in stock selection today. The greater the percentage
increase, the better.
And yet during the Internet boom of the wild late 1990s, some people
bought stocks based on nothing more than big stories of profits and riches
to come, as most Internet and dot-com companies had shown only deficits
to date. Given that companies such as AOL and Yahoo! were actually show-
ing earnings, risking your hard-earned money in other, unproven stocks was
simply not necessary.
AOL and Yahoo! were the real leaders at that time. When the inevitable
market correction (downturn) hit, lower-grade, more speculative companies
with no earnings rapidly suffered the largest declines. You don’t need that
added risk.
I am continually amazed at how some professional money managers, let
alone individual investors, buy common stocks when the current reported
quarter’s earnings are flat (no change) or down. There is absolutely no good
reason for a stock to go anywhere in a big, sustainable way if its current earn-
ings are poor.
Even profit gains of 5% to 10% are insufficient to fuel a major price
movement in a stock. Besides, a company showing an increase of as little as
8% or 10% is more likely to suddenly report lower or slower earnings the
next quarter.
Unlike some institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks, and
insurance companies, which have billions under management and which
may be restricted by the size of their funds, individual investors have the
luxury of investing in only the very best stocks in each bull cycle. While
some companies with no earnings (like Amazon.com and Priceline.com)
had big moves in their stocks in 1998–1999, most investors in that time
period would have been better off buying stocks like America Online and
Charles Schwab, both of which had strong earnings.
Following the CAN SLIM strategy’s emphasis on earnings ensures that
an investor will always be led to the strongest stocks in any market cycle,

C = Current Big or Accelerating Quarterly Earnings and Sales per Share
regardless of any temporary, highly speculative “bubbles” or euphoria. Of
course, you don’t buy on earnings growth alone. Several other factors, which
we’ll cover in the chapters that follow, are almost as important. It’s just that
EPS is the mostimportant.
Watch Out for Misleading Earnings Reports
Have you ever read a corporation’s quarterly earnings report that went like
this:
We had a terrible first three months. Prospects for our company are turning
down because of inefficiencies at the home office. Our competition just
came out with a better product, which will adversely affect our sales. Fur-
thermore, we are losing our shirt on the new Midwestern operation, which
was a real blunder on management’s part.
No way! Here’s what you see instead:
Greatshakes Corporation reports record sales of $7.2 million versus $6 mil-
lion (+20%) for the quarter ended March 31.
If you’re a Greatshakes stockholder, this sounds like wonderful news. You
certainly aren’t going to be disappointed. After all, you believe that this is a
fine company (if you didn’t, you wouldn’t have invested in it in the first
place), and the report confirms your thinking.
But is this “record-breaking” sales announcement a good report? Let’s sup-
pose the company also had record earnings of $2.10 per share, up 5% from
the $2.00 per share reported for the same quarter a year ago. Is it even better
now? The question you have to ask is, why were sales up 20% but earnings
ahead only 5%? What does this say about the company’s profit margins?
Most investors are impressed with what they read, and companies love to
put their best foot forward in their press releases and TV appearances.
However, even though this company’s sales grew 20% to an all-time high, it
didn’t mean much for the company’s profits. The key question for the win-
ning investor must always be:
How much are the current quarter’s earnings per share up
(in percentage terms) from the same quarter the year before?
Let’s say your company discloses that sales climbed 10% and net income
advanced 12%. Sound good? Not necessarily. You shouldn’t be concerned
with the company’s total net income. You don’t own the whole organization;
you own shares in it. Over the last 12 months, the company might have
issued additional shares or “diluted” the common stock in other ways. So

==================================================

156
A WINNING SYSTEM
while net income may be up 12%, earnings per share—your main focus as
an investor—may have edged up only 5% or 6%.
You must be able to see through slanted presentations. Don’t let the use
of words like salesandnet incomedivert your attention from the truly vital
facts like current quarterly earnings. To further clarify this point:
You should always compare a company’s earnings per share to the same
quarter a year earlier, not to the prior quarter, to avoid any distortion
resulting from seasonality. In other words, you don’t compare the
December quarter’s earnings per share to the prior September quarter’s
earnings per share. Rather, compare the December quarter to the
December quarter of the previous year for a more accurate evaluation.
Omit a Company’s One-Time Extraordinary Gains
The winning investor should avoid the trap of being influenced by nonre-
curring profits. For example, if a computer maker reports earnings for the
last quarter that include nonrecurring profits from activities such as the sale
of real estate, this portion of earnings should be subtracted from the report.
Such earnings represent a one-time event, not the true, ongoing profitabil-
ity of corporate operations. Ignore the earnings that result from such events.
Is it possible that the earnings of New York’s Citigroup bank may have
been propped up at times during the 1990s by nonrecurring sales of com-
mercial real estate prior to the bank’s later leveraged involvement in the
subprime disaster?
Set a Minimum Level for Current Earnings Increases
Whether you’re a new or an experienced investor, I would advise against
buying any stock that doesn’t show earnings per share up at least 18% or
20% in the most recent quarter versus the same quarter the year before. In
our study of the greatest winning companies, we found that they all had this
in common prior to their big price moves. Many successful investors use
25% or 30% as their minimum earnings parameter.
To be even safer, insist that both of the last two quarters show significant
earnings gains. During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to
concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or
more. You have thousands of stocks to choose from. Why not buy the very
best merchandise available?
To further sharpen your stock selection process, look ahead to the next
quarter or two and check the earnings that were reported for those same



==================================================

quarters the previous year. See if the company will be coming up against
unusually large or small earnings achieved a year ago. When the unusual
year-earlier results are not caused by seasonal factors, this step may help you
anticipate a strong or poor earnings report in the coming months.
Also, be sure to check consensus earnings estimates (projections that
combine the earnings estimates of a large group of analysts) for the next sev-
eral quarters—and for the next year or two—to make sure the company is
projected to be on a positive track. Some earnings estimate services even
show an estimated annual earnings growth rate for the next five years for
many companies.
Many individuals and even some institutional investors buy stocks whose
earnings were down in the most recently reported quarter because they like
the company and think that its stock price is “cheap.” Usually they accept
the story that earnings will rebound strongly in the near future. In some
cases this may be true, but in many cases it isn’t. Again, the point is that you
have the choice of investing in thousands of companies, many of which are
actually showing strong operating results. You don’t have to accept promises
of earnings that may never occur.
Requiring that current quarterly earnings be up a hefty amount is just
another smart way for the intelligent investor to reduce the risk of mistakes
in stock selection. But you must also understand that in the late stage of a
bull market, some or even many leaders that have had long runs may top out
even though their earnings are up 100%. This usually fools investors and
analysts alike. It pays to know your market history.
Avoid Big Older Companies with Maintainer Management
In fact, many older American corporations have mediocre management that
continually produces second-rate earnings results. I call these people the
“entrenched maintainers” or “caretaker management.” You want to avoid
these companies until someone has the courage to change the top execu-
tives. Not coincidentally, they are generally the companies that strain to
pump up their current earnings a still-dull 8% or 10%. True growth compa-
nies with outstanding new products or improved management do not have
to inflate their current results.
Look for Accelerating Quarterly Earnings Growth
Our analysis of the most successful stocks also showed that, in almost every
case, earnings growth acceleratedsometime in the 10 quarters before a tow-
ering price move began. In other words, it’s not just increased earnings and



==================================================

==================================================

158
A WINNING SYSTEM
the size of the increase that cause a big move. It’s also that the increase rep-
resents an improvement from the company’s prior rate of earnings growth.
If a company’s earnings have been up 15% a year and suddenly begin spurt-
ing 40% to 50% or more—what Wall Street usually calls “earnings sur-
prises”—this usually creates the conditions for important stock price
improvement.
Other valuable ways to track a stock’s earnings include determining
how many times in recent months analysts have raised their estimates for
the company plus the percentage by which several previous quarterly earn-
ings reports have actually beaten the estimates.
Look for Sales Growth as Well as Earnings Growth
Strong and improving quarterly earnings should always be supported by
sales growth of at least 25% for the latest quarter, or at least an acceleration
in the rate of sales percentage improvement over the last three quarters.
Certain newer issues (initial public offerings) may show sales growth aver-
aging 100% or more in each of the last 8, 10, or 12 quarters. Check all these
stocks out.
Take particular note if the growth of bothsales and earnings has acceler-
ated for the last three quarters. You don’t want to get impatient and sell your
stock if it shows this type of acceleration. Stick to your position.
Some professional investors bought Waste Management at $50 in early
1998 because earnings had jumped three quarters in a row from 24% to
75% and 268%. But sales were up only 5%. Several months later, the stock
collapsed to $15 a share.
This demonstrates that companies can inflate earnings for a few quarters
by reducing costs or spending less on advertising, research and develop-
ment, and other constructive activities. To be sustainable, however, earnings
growth must be supported by higher sales. Such was not the case with Waste
Management.
It also helps improve your batting average if the latest quarter’s after-tax
profit margins for your stock selections are either at or near a new high and
among the very best in the company’s own industry. Yes, you have to do a lit-
tle homework if you want to really improve your results. No pain, no gain.
Two Quarters of Major Earnings Deceleration
Can Be Trouble for Your Stock
Just as it’s important to recognize when quarterly earnings growth is accel-
erating, it’s also important to know when earnings begin to decelerate, or

C = Current Big or Accelerating Quarterly Earnings and Sales per Share
slow down significantly. If a company that has been growing at a quarterly
rate of 50% suddenly reports earnings gains of only 15%, that might spell
trouble, and you may want to avoid that company.
Even the best organizations can have a slow quarter every once in a while.
So before turning negative on a company’s earnings, I prefer to see two con-
secutive quarters of material slowdown. This usually means a decline of
two-thirds or greater from the previous rate—a slowdown from 100% earn-
ings growth to 30%, for example, or from 50% to 15%.
Consult Log-Scale Weekly Graphs
Understanding the principle of earnings acceleration or deceleration is
essential.
Securities analysts who recommend stocks because of the absolute level
of earnings expected for the following year could be looking at the wrong set
of numbers. The fact that a stock earned $5 per share and expects to report
$6 the next year (a “favorable” 20% increase) could be misleading unless
you know the previous trend in the percentage rate of earnings change.
What if earnings were previously up 60%? This partially explains why so few
investors make significant money following the buy and sell recommenda-
tions of securities analysts.
Logarithmic-scale graphs are of great value in analyzing stocks because
they clearly show the acceleration or deceleration in the percentage rate of
quarterly earnings increases. One inch anywhere on the price or earnings
scale represents the same percentage change. This is not true of arithmeti-
cally scaled charts.
On an arithmetically scaled chart, a 100% price increase from $10 to $20
a share shows the same space change as a 50% increase from $20 to $30 a
share. In contrast, a log-scale graph would show the 100% increase as being
twice as large as the 50% increase.
As a do-it-yourself investor, you can take the latest quarterly earnings per
share along with the prior three quarters’ EPS, and plot them on a logarith-
mic-scale graph to get a clear picture of earnings acceleration or decelera-
tion. For the best companies, plotting the most recent 12-month earnings
each quarter should put the earnings per share point close to or already at
new highs.
Check Other Stocks in the Group
For additional validation, check the earnings of other companies in your
stock’s industry group. If you can’t find at least one other impressive stock

displaying strong earnings in the group, chances are you may have selected
the wrong investment.
Where to Find Current Quarterly Earnings Reports
Quarterly corporate earnings statements used to be published in the busi-
ness sections of most local newspapers and financial publications every day.
But many publications are downsizing their business sections these days,
dropping data right and left. As a result, they no longer adequately cover the
most important thing that investors need to know.
This is not true of Investor’s Business Daily. IBD not only continues to
provide detailed earnings coverage, but goes a step further and separates
all new earnings reports into companies with “up” earnings and those
reporting “down” results, so you can easily see who produced excellent
gains and who didn’t.
Chart services such as Daily Graphs®and Daily Graphs Online also show
earnings reported during the week as well as the most recent earnings figures
for every stock they chart. Once you locate the percentage change in earn-
ings per share when compared to the same year-ago quarter, also compare
the percentage change in EPS on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Looking at the
March quarter and then at the June, September, and December quarters will
tell you if a company’s earnings growth is accelerating or decelerating.
You now have the first critical rule for improving your stock selection:
Current quarterly earnings per share should be up a major percentage—
25% to 50% at a minimum—over the same quarter the previous year. The
best companies might show earnings up 100% to 500% or more!
A mediocre 10% or 12% isn’t enough. When you’re picking winning
stocks, it’s the bottom line that counts.

• CHAPTER •
A = Annual Earnings Increases:
Look for Big Growth
Any company can report a good earnings quarter every once in a while. And as
we’ve seen, strong current quarterly earnings are critical to picking most of
the market’s biggest winners. But they’re not enough.
To make sure the latest results aren’t just a flash in the pan, and the com-
pany you’re looking at is of high quality, you must insist on more proof. The
way to do that is by reviewing the company’s annualearnings growth rate.
Look for annual earnings per share that have increased in each of the last
three years. You normally don’t want the second year’s earnings to be down,
even if the results in the following year rebound to the highest level yet. It’s
the combination of strong earnings in the last several quarters plus a record
of solid growth in recent years that creates a superb stock, or at least one
with a higher probability of success during an uptrending general market.
Select Stocks with 25% to 50% and
Higher Annual Earnings Growth Rates
The annual rate of earnings growth for the companies you pick should be
25%, 50%, or even 100% or more. Between 1980 and 2000, the median
annual growth rate of all outstanding stocks in our study at their early
emerging stage was 36%. Three out of four big winners showed at least
some positive annual growth over the three years, and in some cases the five
years, preceding the stocks’ big run-ups.
A typical earnings per share progression for the five years preceding the
stock’s move might be something like $0.70, $1.15, $1.85, $2.65, and $4.00.

A WINNING SYSTEM
In a few cases, you might accept one down year in five as long as the follow-
ing year’s earnings move back to new high ground.
It’s possible a company could earn $4.00 a share one year, $5.00 the next,
$6.00 the next, and then $3.00 a share. If the next annual earnings statement
was, say, $4.00 per share versus the prior year’s $3.00, this would not be a
good report despite the 33% increase over the prior year. The only reason it
might seem positive is that the previous year’s earnings ($3.00 a share) were
so depressed that any improvement would look good. The point is, profits
are recovering slowly and are still well below the company’s peak annual
earnings of $6.00 a share.
The consensus among analysts on what earnings will be for the next year
should also be up—the more, the better. But remember: estimates are per-
sonal opinions, and opinions may be wrong (too high or too low). Actual
reported earnings are facts.
Look for a Big Return on Equity
You should also be aware of two other measurements of profitability and
growth: return on equity and cash flow per share.
Return on equity, or ROE, is calculated by dividing net income by share-
holders’ equity. This shows how efficiently a company uses its money,
thereby helping to separate well-managed firms from those that are poorly
managed. Our studies show that nearly all the greatest growth stocks of the
past 50 years had ROEs of at least 17%. (The really superior growth situa-
tions will sport 25% to 50% ROEs.)
To determine cash flow, add back the amount of depreciation the com-
pany shows to reflect the amount of cash that is being generated internally.
Some growth stocks can also show annual cash flow per share that is at least
20% greater than actual earnings per share.
Check the Stability of a Company’s
Three-Year Earnings Record
Through our research, we’ve determined another factor that has proved
important in selecting growth stocks: the stability and consistency of annual
earnings growth over the past three years. Our stability measurement,
which is expressed on a scale of 1 to 99, is calculated differently from most
statistics. The lower the figure, the more stable the past earnings record.
The figures are calculated by plotting quarterly earnings for the past three
or five years and fitting a trend line around the plotted points to determine
the degree of deviation from the basic growth trend.

A = Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Big Growth
Growth stocks with steady earnings tend to have a stability figure below 20
or 25. Companies with stability ratings over 30 are more cyclical and a little
less dependable in terms of their growth. All other things being equal, you
may want to look for stocks showing a greater degree of sustainability, con-
sistency, and stability in past earnings growth. Some companies that are
growing 25% per year could have a stability rating of 1, 2, or 3. When the
quarterly earnings for several years are plotted on a log-scale chart, the earn-
ings line should be nearly straight, consistently moving up. In most cases
there will be some acceleration in the rate of increase in recent quarters.

Sample earnings stability
Earnings stability numbers are customarily shown right after a company’s
annual growth rate, but most analysts and investment services don’t bother
to make the calculation. We show them in many of our institutional products
as well as in Daily Graphs and Daily Graphs Online, which are designed for
individual investors.
If you restrict your stock selections to ventures with proven growth
records, you will avoid the hundreds of investments with erratic histories or
cyclical recoveries in profits. A few such stocks could “top out” as they
approach the peaks of their prior earnings cycle.
What Is a Normal Stock Market Cycle?
History demonstrates most bull (up) markets last two to four years and are fol-
lowed by a recession or a bear (down) market. Then another bull market starts.
In the beginning phase of a new bull market, growth stocks are usually
the first to lead and make new price highs. These are companies whose
profits have grown quarter to quarter, but whose stocks have been held back
by the poor general market conditions. The combination of a general mar-
ket decline and a stock’s continued profit growth will have compressed the
price/earnings (P/E) ratio to a point where it is attractive to institutional
investors, for whom P/Es are important.

A WINNING SYSTEM
Cyclical stocks in basic industries such as steel, chemicals, paper, rubber,
autos, and machinery usually lag in the new bull market’s early phase.
Young growth stocks will typically dominate for at least two bull market
cycles. Then the emphasis may change to cyclicals, turnarounds, or other
newly improved sectors for a short period.
While three out of four big market winners in the past were growth
stocks, one in four was a cyclical or turnaround situation. In 1982, Chrysler
and Ford were two such spirited turnaround plays. Cyclical and turnaround
opportunities led in the market waves of 1953–1955, 1963–1965, and
1974–1975. Cyclicals including paper, aluminum, autos, chemicals, and
plastics returned to the fore in 1987, and home-building stocks, which are
also cyclical, have led in other periods. Examples of turnaround situations
include IBM in 1994 and Apple in 2003.
Yet even when cyclical stocks are in favor, some pretty dramatic young
growth issues are also available. Cyclical stocks in the United States are often
those in older, less-efficient industries. Some of these companies weren’t
competitive until the demand for steel, copper, chemicals, and oil surged as
a result of the rapid buildup of basic industries in China. That’s why cyclicals
were resurrected aggressively after the 2000 bear market ended in 2003.
They are still cyclical stocks, however, and they may not represent Amer-
ica’s true future. In addition, large, old-line companies in America fre-
quently have the added disadvantage of size: they are simply too large to be
able to innovate and continually renew themselves so that they can compete
with nimble foreign rivals and with America’s young new entrepreneurs.
Rallies in cyclical stocks may tend to be more short-lived and prone to falter
at the first hint of a recession or an earnings slowdown. Should you decide to
buy a turnaround stock, look for annual earnings growth of at least 5% to 10%
and two straight quarters of sharp earnings recovery that lift results for the lat-
est 12 months into or very near new high ground. Check the 12-month earnings
line on a stock chart; the sharper the angle of the earnings upswing, the better.
If the profit upswing is so dramatic that it reaches a new high, one quar-
ter of earnings turnaround will sometimes suffice. Cleveland Cliffs, a sup-
plier of iron ore pellets to the steel industry (and now known as Cliffs
Natural Resources), came from a deficit position to dramatically accelerate
quarterly earnings in 2004 by 64% and then by 241%. With that impetus,
the stock rapidly advanced 170% in the next eight months.
How to Weed Out the Losers in a Group
Insisting on three years of earnings growth will help you quickly weed out
80% of the stocks in any industry group. Growth rates for most stocks in
most groups are lackluster or nonexistent—unlike, for example,

• Xerox, which was growing at a 32% annual rate before its shares soared
700% from March 1963 to June 1966
• Wal-Mart Stores, which consistently created an annual growth rate of
43% before rocketing 11,200% from 1977 to 1990
• Cisco Systems, whose earnings were exploding at a 257% rate in October
1990, and Microsoft, which was growing at a 99% clip in October 1986,
before their enormous advances
• Priceline.com, which from 2004 to 2006 more than doubled its earnings
from 96 cents a share to $2.03, before it tripled in price in the next five
quarters
• Google, which had already expanded its earnings from 55 cents a share in
2002 to $2.51 a share in 2004 before its stock climbed from $200 to $700
by 2007
Keep in mind that an annual growth record doesn’t necessarily make a
company a solid growth stock. In fact, some so-called growth stocks report
substantially slower growth than they did in earlier market periods. Many
growth leaders in one cycle do not repeat in the next cycle.
The stock of a company that has an outstanding three-year growth record
of 30% but whose earnings growth has slowed to 10% or 15% in the last sev-
eral quarters acts like a fully mature growth stock. Older and larger organiza-
tions are usually characterized by slower growth, and many of them should be
avoided. America is continually led and driven by new innovative entrepre-
neurial companies. They, and not our government, create our new industries.
Insist on Both Annual and Current Quarterly
Earnings Being Excellent
A standout stock needs both a sound growth record in recent years and a
strong current earnings record in the last several quarters. It’s the powerful
combination of these two critical factors, rather than one or the other, that
creates a super stock, or at least one that has a higher chance for true success.
The fastest way to find a company with strong and accelerating current
earnings and solid three-year growth is by checking the proprietary Earn-
ings per Share (EPS) Rating provided for every stock listed in Investor’s
Business Daily’s research stock tables.
The EPS Rating measures a company’s two most recent quarters of
earnings growth against the same quarters the year before and examines
its growth rate over the last three years. The results are then compared
with those of all other publicly traded companies and rated on a scale
from 1 to 99, with 99 being best. An EPS Rating of 99 means a company

has outperformed 99% of all other companies in terms of both annual and
recent quarterly earnings performance.
If the stock is newly issued and the company doesn’t have a three-year
earnings record, look for big earnings increases and even bigger sales
growth over the last five or six quarters. One or two quarters of profitability
are often not enough and indicate a less-proven stock that might fall apart
somewhere down the line.
Are Price/Earnings Ratios Really Important?
If you’re like most investors, you’ve probably learned the most important
thing you need to know about a stock is its P/E ratio. Well, prepare yourself
for a bubble-bursting surprise.
For years, analysts have used P/E ratios as their basic measurement tool in
deciding whether a stock is undervalued (has a low P/E) and should be bought,
or is overvalued (has a high P/E) and should be sold. But our ongoing analysis
of the most successful stocks from 1880 to the present shows that, contrary to
most investors’ beliefs, P/E ratios were not a relevant factor in price movement
and have very little to do with whether a stock should be bought or sold.
Much more crucial, we found, was the percentage increase in earnings
per share. To say that a security is “undervalued” because it’s selling at a low
P/E or because it’s in the low end of its historical P/E range can be nonsense.
Primary consideration should be given to whether the rate of change in earnings
is substantially increasing or decreasing.
From 1953 through 1985, the average P/E ratio for the best-performing
stocks at their early emerging stage was 20. (The average P/E of the Dow
Jones Industrials over the same period was 15.) As they advanced, the biggest
winners expanded their P/Es by 125%, to about 45. From 1990 to 1995, the
real leaders began with an average P/E of 36 and expanded into the 80s. But
these were just the averages. Beginning P/Es for most big winners ranged
from 25 to 50, and the P/E expansions varied from 60 to 115. In the market
euphoria of the late 1990s, these valuations increased to even greater levels.
Value buyers missed almost all of these tremendous investments.
Why You Missed Some Fabulous Stocks!
These findings strongly suggest that if you weren’t willing to buy growth
stocks at 25 to 50 times earnings, or even much more, you automatically
eliminated most of the best investments available! You missed Microsoft,
Cisco Systems, Home Depot, America Online, and many, many others dur-
ing their periods of greatest market performance.

A = Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Big Growth
Our studies suggest P/E ratios are an end effect of accelerating earnings
that, in turn, attract big institutional buyers, resulting in strong price per-
formance. P/Es are not a cause of excellent performance. High P/Es, for
example, were found to occur because of bull markets. Low P/Es, with the
exception of those on cyclical stocks, generally occurred because of bear
markets.
In a roaring bull market, don’t overlook a stock just because its P/E seems
too high. It could be the next great winner. And never buy a stock just
because the P/E ratio makes it look like a bargain. There are usually good
reasons why the P/E is low, and there’s no golden rule that prevents a stock
that sells at 8 or 10 times earnings from going even lower and selling at 4 or
5 times earnings.
Many years ago, when I first began to study the market, I bought
Northrop at 4 times earnings and watched in disbelief as the stock declined
to a P/E ratio of 2.
How Price/Earnings Ratios Are Misused
Many Wall Street analysts put a stock on their “buy” list because it’s selling
at the low end of its historical P/E range. They’ll also recommend a stock
when the price starts to drop, thereby lowering the P/E and making it seem
like an even bigger bargain.
In 1998, Gillette and Coca-Cola looked like great buys because they had
sold off several points and their P/Es looked more attractive. In actuality,
the earnings at both companies were showing a material deceleration that
justified a lower valuation. A great deal of P/E analysis is based on personal
opinions and theories that have been handed down through the years by
analysts, academicians, and others, whose track records when it comes to
making money in the market are both questionable and undocumented. In
2008, some Wall Street analysts recommended buying Bank of America all
the way down. There are no safe, sure things in the market. That’s why you
need avoid or sell rules as well as buy rules.
Reliance on P/E ratios often ignores more basic trends. The general mar-
ket, for example, may have topped, in which case all stocks are headed
lower. To say a company is undervalued because at one time it was selling at
22 times earnings and it can now be bought for 15 is ridiculous and some-
what naive.
One way I dosometimes use P/E ratios is to estimate the potential price
objective for a growth stock over the next 6 to 18 months based on its esti-
mated future earnings. I may take the earnings estimate for the next two
years and multiply it by the stock’s P/E ratio at the initial chart base buy

A WINNING SYSTEM
point, then multiply the result by 100% or slightly more. This is the degree
of P/E expansion possible on average if a growth stock has a major price
move. This tells me what a growth stock could potentially sell for during bull
market conditions. However, there are some bull markets and certain
growth stocks that may have little or no P/E expansion.
For example, if Charles Schwab’s stock breaks out of its first base at $43.75
per share (as it did in late 1998) and its P/E ratio at the beginning buy point
is 40, multiply 40 by 130% to see that the P/E ratio could possibly expand to
92 if the stock has a huge price move. Next, multiply the potential P/E ratio
of 92 by the consensus earnings estimate two years out of $1.45 per share.
This tells you what a possible price objective for your growth stock might be.
The Wrong Way to Analyze Companies in an Industry
Another faulty use of P/E ratios, by amateurs and professionals alike, is to
evaluate the stocks in an industry and conclude the one selling at the cheap-
est P/E is always undervalued and therefore the most attractive purchase.
The reality is, the lowest P/E usually belongs to the company with the most
ghastly earnings record.
The simple truth is that at any given time, stocks usually sell near their
current value. The stock that sells at 20 times earnings is at that level for one
set of reasons, and the stock that trades at 15 times earnings is at that level
for another set of reasons. A stock selling at, say, 7 times earnings does so
because its overall record is more deficient than that of a stock with a higher
P/E ratio. Also, keep in mind that cyclical stocks normally have lower P/Es,
and that, even in good periods, they do not show the P/E expansion that
occurs in growth stocks.
You can’t buy a Mercedes for the price of a Chevrolet, and you can’t buy
oceanfront property for the same price you’d pay for land a couple of miles
inland. Everything sells for about what it’s worth at the time based on the
law of supply and demand.
The increased value of great paintings was brought about almost single-
handedly many years ago by a fine-arts dealer named Joseph Duveen. He
would travel to Europe and buy one-of-a-kind paintings by Rembrandt and
others, paying more than the market price. He would then bring them back to
the United States and sell them to Henry Ford and other industrialists of that
era for substantially more than he had paid. In other words, Lord Duveen
bought the one-of-a-kind masterpieces high and sold them much higher.
The point is, anyone can buy a mediocre piece of art for a low price, but
the very best costs more. The very best stocks, like the very best art, usually
command a higher price.

A = Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Big Growth
If a company’s price and P/E ratio change in the near future, it’s because
conditions, events, psychology, and earnings have continued to improve or
started to deteriorate. Eventually, a stock’s P/E will reach a peak, but this
normally occurs when the general market averages are topping out and
starting a significant decline. It could also be a signal the company’s rate of
earnings growth is about to weaken.
It’s true high-P/E stocks will be more volatile, particularly if they’re in the
high-tech area. The price of a high-P/E stock can also temporarily get ahead
of itself, but the same can be said for lower-P/E stocks.
Examples of High P/Es That Were Great Bargains
In situations where small but captivating growth companies have revolu-
tionary new products, what seems like a high P/E ratio can actually be low.
For instance,
• Xerox, which introduced the first dry copier in 1959, sold for 100 times
earnings in 1960—before it advanced 3,300% in price (from a split-
adjusted $5 to $170).
• Syntex, the first company to submit a patent for a birth control pill, sold
for 45 times earnings in July 1963—before it advanced 400%.
• Genentech, a pioneer in the use of genetic information to develop new
wonder drugs and the first biotech company to go public, was initially
priced at 200 times earnings in November 1985. In five months, the new
stock bolted 300%.
• America Online, whose software gave millions access to the revolutionary
new world of the Internet, sold for over 100 times earnings in November
1994 before climbing 14,900% to its peak in December 1999.
• Google’s P/E was in the 50s and 60s from $115 a share in September 2004
until it hit $475 a share in early January 2006.
The fact is, investors with a bias against what they consider to be high
P/Es will miss out on some of the greatest opportunities of this or any other
time. During bull markets, in particular, such a bias could literally cost you
a fortune.
Don’t Sell High-P/E Stocks Short
In June 1962, when the stock market was at rock bottom, a big Beverly Hills
investor barged into the office of a broker friend of mine and shouted that,
at 50 times earnings, Xerox was drastically overpriced. He proceeded to sell

2,000 shares short at $88 (borrowing stock from his broker to sell in hopes
the stock would decline and he could later buy it back cheaper, making
money on the difference in price). Sure enough, the stock took off at once
and ultimately reached a price of $1,300 (before adjusting for splits) with a
P/E ratio that topped 80.
So much for opinions about P/Es being too high! Investors’ personal
opinions are usually wrong; the market is almost always right. So stop fight-
ing and arguing with the market.
Concentrate on stocks with proven records of significant earnings growth
in each of the last three years plus strong recent quarterly improvements.
Don’t accept anything less.

It takes something new to produce a startling advance in the price of a stock. It
can be an important new product or service that sells rapidly and causes
earnings to accelerate faster than previous rates of increase. Or it can be a
change of management that brings new vigor, new ideas, or at least a new
broom to sweep everything clean. New industry conditions—such as supply
shortages, price increases, or the introduction of revolutionary technolo-
gies—can also have a positive effect on most stocks in an industry group.
In our study of the greatest stock market winners, which now spans the
period from 1880 through 2008, we discovered that more than 95% of suc-
cessful stocks with stunning growth in American industry fell into at least
one of these categories. In the late 1800s, there was the new railroad indus-
try connecting every part of our country, electricity, the telephone, and
George Eastman’s camera. Edison created the phonograph, the motion pic-
ture camera, and the lightbulb. Next came the auto, the airplane, and then
the radio. The refrigerator replaced the icebox. Television, the computer, jet
planes, the personal computer, fax machines, the Internet, cell phones . . .
America’s relentless inventors and entrepreneurs never quit. They built and
created America’s amazing growth record with their new products and new
companies. These, in turn, created millions and millions of new jobs and a
higher standard of living for the vast majority of Americans. In spite of
bumps in the road, most Americans are far better off than they or their par-
ents were 30 or 50 years ago.

New Products That Created Super Successes
The way a company can achieve enormous success, thereby enjoying large
gains in its stock price, is by introducing dramatic new products into the
marketplace. I’m not talking about a new formula for dish soap. I’m talking
about products that revolutionize the way we live. Here are just a few of the
thousands of entrepreneurial companies that drove America and, during
their time in the sun, created millions of jobs and a higher standard of living
in the United States than in other areas of the world:
1. Northern Pacific was chartered as the first transcontinental railroad.
Around 1900, its stock rocketed more than 4,000% in just 197 weeks.
2. General Motors began as the Buick Motor Company. In 1913–1914,
GM stock increased 1,368%.
3. RCA, by 1926, had captured the market for commercial radio. Then,
from June 1927, when the stock traded at $50, it advanced on a presplit
basis to $575 before the market collapsed in 1929.
4. After World War II, Rexall’s new Tupperware division helped push the
company’s stock to $50 a share in 1958, from $16.
5. Thiokol came out with new rocket fuels for missiles in 1957–1959, pro-
pelling its shares from $48 to the equivalent of $355.
6. Syntex marketed the oral contraceptive pill in 1963. In six months, the
stock soared from $100 to $550.
7. McDonald’s, with low-priced fast-food franchising, snowballed from
1967 to 1971 to create an 1,100% profit for stockholders.
8. Levitz Furniture’s stock soared 660% in 1970–1971 on the popularity
of the company’s giant warehouse discount-furniture centers.
9. Houston Oil & Gas, with a major new oil field, ran up 968% in 61
weeks in 1972–1973 and picked up another 367% in 1976.
10. Computervision’s stock advanced 1,235% in 1978–1980 with the intro-
duction of its new CAD-CAM factory-automation equipment.
11. Wang Labs’ Class B shares grew 1,350% in 1978–1980 on the develop-
ment of its new word-processing office machines.
12. Price Company’s stock shot up more than 15 times in 1982–1986 with
the opening of a southern California chain of innovative wholesale
warehouse membership stores.
13. Amgen developed two successful new biotech drugs, Epogen and Neu-
pogen, and the stock raced ahead from $60 in 1990 to the equivalent of
$460 in early 1992.

14. Cisco Systems, yet another California company, created routers and
networking equipment that enabled companies to link up geographi-
cally dispersed local area computer networks. The stock rose nearly
2,000% from November 1990 to March 1994. In 10 years—1990 to
2000—it soared an unbelievable 75,000%.
15. International Game Technology surged 1,600% in 1991–1993 with
new microprocessor-based gaming products.
16. Microsoft stock was carried up almost 1,800% from March 1993 to the
end of 1999 as its innovative Windows software products dominated
the personal computer market.
17. PeopleSoft, the number one maker of personnel software, achieved a
20-fold increase in the 31⁄ years starting in August 1994.

18. Dell Computer, the leader and innovator in build-to-order, direct PC
sales, advanced 1,780% from November 1996 to January 1999.
19. EMC, with superior computer memory devices, capitalized on the
ever-increasing need for network storage and raced up 478% in the 15
months starting in January 1998.
20. AOL and Yahoo!, the two top Internet leaders providing consumers
with the new “portals” needed to access the wealth of services and
information on the Internet, both produced 500% gains from the fall of
1998 to their peaks in 1999.
21. Oracle’s database and e-business applications software drove its stock
from $20 to $90 in only 29 weeks, starting in 1999.
22. Charles Schwab, the number one online discount broker, racked up a
414% gain in just six months starting in late 1998, a period that saw a
shift to online trading,
23. Hansen Natural’s “Monster” energy fruit drinks were a hit with the
workout crowd, and its stock bolted 1,219% in only 86 weeks beginning
in late 2004.
24. Google gave the world instant information via the Internet, and its
stock advanced 536% from its initial offering in 2004.
25. Apple and the new iPod music player created a sensation that carried the
company’s stock up 1,580% from a classic cup-with-handle base price
pattern that was easy to spot on February 27, 2004—if you used charts.
And if you missed that last golden opportunity, you had four more classic
base pattern chances to buy Apple: on August 27, 2004; July 15, 2005; Sep-
tember 1, 2006; and April 27, 2007—if you checked a chart book each week.

In the years ahead, hundreds and thousands of new creative leaders just
like these will continue to surface and be available for you to purchase. Peo-
ple from all over the world come to America to capitalize on its freedom and
opportunity. That’s one secret of our success that many countries do not
have. So don’t ever get discouraged and give up on the lifetime opportunity
that the stock market will provide. If you study, save, prepare, and educate
yourself, you too will be able to recognize many of the future big winners as
they appear. You can do it, if you have the necessary drive and determina-
tion. It doesn’t make any difference who you are or where you came from or
your current position in life. It’s all up to you. Do you want to get ahead?
The Stock Market’s “Great Paradox”
There is another fascinating phenomenon we found in the early stage of all
winning stocks. We call it the “Great Paradox.” Before I tell you what it is, I
want you to look at the accompanying graphs of three typical stocks.
Which one looks like the best buy to you, A, B, or C? Which would you
avoid? We’ll give you the answer at the end of this chapter.
The staggering majority of individual investors, whether new or experi-
enced, take delightful comfort in buying stocks that are down substantially
from their peaks, thinking that they’re getting a bargain. Among the hun-
dreds of thousands of individual investors attending my investment lectures
in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, many said that they do not buy stocks
that are making new highs in price.
This bias is not limited to individual investors, however. I have provided
extensive historical precedent research for more than 600 major institu-
tional investors, and I have found that a number of them are also “bottom
buyers.” They, too, feel it’s safer to buy stocks that look like bargains because
they’re either down a lot in price or actually selling near their lows.
Our study of the greatest stock market winners proved that the old adage
“buy low, sell high” was completely wrong. In fact, our study proved the
exact opposite. The hard-to-believe Great Paradox in the stock market is
What seems too high in price and risky to the majority usually goes higher
eventually, and what seems low and cheap usually goes lower.
Are you finding this “high-altitude paradox” a little difficult to act upon?
Let me cite another study we conducted. In this one, we analyzed two
groups of stocks—those that made new highs and those that made new
lows—over many bull market periods. The results were conclusive: stocks
on the new-high list tended to go higher in price, while those on the new-
low list tended to go lower.

A WINNING SYSTEM
Based on our research, a stock on Investor’s Business Daily’s “new price
low” list tends to be a pretty poor prospect and should be avoided. In fact,
decisive investors should sell such stocks long before they ever get near the
new-low list. A stock making the new-high list—especially one making the
list for the first time while trading on big volume during a bull market—
might be a prospect with big potential.
How Does a Stock Go from $50 to $100?
If you can’t bring yourself to buy a stock at a level it has never before
achieved, ask yourself: What does a stock that has traded between $40 and
$50 a share over many months, and is now selling at $50, have to do to dou-
ble in price? Doesn’t it first have to go through $51, then $52, $53, $54, $55,
and so on—all new price highs—before it can reach $100?
As a smart investor, your job is to buy when a stock looks too high to the
majority of conventional investors and sell after it moves substantially higher
and finally begins to look attractive to some of those same investors. If you had
bought Cisco in November of 1990 at the highest price it had ever sold for,
when it had just made a new high and looked scary, you would have enjoyed a
nearly 75,000% increase from that point forward to its peak in the year 2000.
The Correct Time to Begin Buying a Stock
Just because a stock is making a new price high doesn’t necessarily mean
that this is the right time to buy. Using stock charts is an important piece of
the stock selection process. A stock’s historical price movement should be
reviewed carefully, and you should look for stocks that are making new price
highs as they break out of proper, correct bases. (Refer back to Chapter 2 for
more detail on reading charts and identifying chart patterns.) The 100 great
full-page examples in Chapter 1 should have given you a real head start.
These correctly created breakouts are the points at which most really big
price advances begin and the possibility of a significant price move is the
greatest. A sound consolidation, or base-building, period could last from
seven or eight weeks up to 15 months.
As noted in Chapter 2, the perfect time to buy is during a bull market just
as a stock is starting to break out of its price base. (See the America Online
chart on page 178.) If the stock is more than 5% or 10% above the exact buy
point off the base, it should be avoided. Buying it at this level greatly
increases the chance of getting shaken out in the next normal correction or
sharp pullback in price. You can’t just buy the best stocks any old time.
There’s a right time, and then there are all the other times.

Answers to the Market’s Great Paradox
Now that you know the Great Paradox, would you still pick the same stock
you did earlier in the chapter? The right one to buy was Stock A, Syntex
Corp., which is shown on the next page. The arrow pointing to July 1963’s
weekly price movements indicates the buy point. This arrow coincides with
the price and volume activity at the end of the Stock A chart, adjusted for a
3-for-1 split. Syntex enjoyed a major price advance from its July 1963 buy
point. In contrast, Stocks B (Halliburton) and C (Comdata Network) both
declined, as you can see from the charts given on the next page. (The arrows
indicate where the corresponding charts shown earlier left off.)
Search for companies that have developed important new products or
services, or that have benefited from new management or materially
improved industry conditions. Then buy their stocks when they are
emerging from sound, correctly analyzed price consolidation patterns and
are close to, or actually making, new price highs on increased volume.

• CHAPTER •
S = Supply and Demand: Big
Volume Demand at Key Points
The price of almost everything in your daily life is determined by the law of supply
and demand. What you pay for your lettuce, tomatoes, eggs, and beef
depends on how much of each is available and how many people want these
items. Even in former Communist countries, where the difference between
haves and have-nots was theoretically nonexistent, supply and demand held
sway. There, state-owned goods were always in short supply and were often
available only to the privileged class or on the black market to those who
could pay the exorbitant prices.
This basic principle of supply and demand also applies to the stock mar-
ket, where it is more important than the opinions of all the analysts on Wall
Street, no matter what schools they attended, what degrees they earned, or
how high their IQs.
Big or Small Supply of Stock
It’s hard to budge the price of a stock that has 5 billion shares outstanding
because the supply is so large. Producing a rousing rally in these shares
would require a huge volume of buying, or demand. On the other hand, it
takes only a reasonable amount of buying to push up the price of a stock
with 50 million shares outstanding, a relatively smaller supply.
So if you’re choosing between two stocks to buy, one with 5 billion shares
outstanding and the other with 50 million, the smaller one will usually be
the better performer, if other factors are equal. However, since smaller-cap-

italization stocks are less liquid, they can come down as fast as they go up,
sometimes even faster. In other words, with greater opportunity comes sig-
nificant additional risk. But there are definite ways of minimizing your risk,
which will be discussed in Chapters 10 and 11.
The total number of shares outstanding in a company’s capital structure
represents the potential amount of stock available. But market professionals
also look at the “floating supply”— the number of shares that are available
for possible purchase after subtracting stock that is closely held. Companies
in which top management owns a large percentage of the stock (at least 1%
to 3% in a large company, and more in small companies) generally are bet-
ter prospects because the managers have a vested interest in the stock.
There’s another fundamental reason, besides supply and demand, why
companies with a large number of shares outstanding frequently produce
slower results: the companies themselves may be much older and growing
at a slower rate. They are simply too big and sluggish.
In the 1990s, however, bigger-capitalization stocks outperformed small-
cap issues for several years. This was in part related to the size problem
experienced by the mutual fund community. It suddenly found itself awash
in new cash as more and more people bought funds. As a result, larger funds
were forced to buy more bigger-cap stocks. This need to put their new
money to work made it appear that they favored bigger-cap issues. But this
was contrary to the normal supply/demand effect, which favors smaller-cap
stocks with fewer shares available to meet increases in institutional investor
demand.
Big-cap stocks do have some advantages: greater liquidity, generally less
downside volatility, better quality, and in some cases less risk. And the
immense buying power that large funds have these days can make top-notch
big stocks advance nearly as fast as shares of smaller companies.
Pick Entrepreneurial Management Rather than Caretakers
Big companies may seem to have a great deal of power and influence, but
size often begets a lack of imagination and productive efficiency. Large
companies are often run by older and more conservative “caretaker man-
agements” that are less willing to innovate, take risks, and move quickly and
wisely to keep up with rapidly changing times. In most cases, top managers
of large companies don’t own a lot of their company’s stock. This is a serious
deficiency that should be corrected. To the savvy investor, it suggests that
the company’s management and employees don’t have a personal interest in
seeing the company succeed. In some cases, large companies also have mul-
tiple layers of management that separate senior executives from what’s

going on at the customer level. And for companies competing in a capitalist
economy, the ultimate boss is the customer.
Communication of information continues to change at an ever-faster rate.
A company that has a hot new product today will find its sales slipping
within two or three years if it doesn’t continue to bring relevant, superior
new products to market. Most new products, services, and inventions come
from young, hungry, and innovative small- and medium-sized companies
with entrepreneurial management. Not coincidentally, these smaller public
and nonpublic companies grow faster and create somewhere between 80%
and 90% of the new jobs in the United States. Many of them are in the ser-
vice or technology and information industries. This is possibly where the
great future growth of America lies. Microsoft, Cisco Systems, and Oracle
are just a few examples of dynamic small-cap innovators of the 1980s and
1990s that continually grew and eventually became big-cap stocks.
If a mammoth older company creates an important new product, it may
not help the stock materially because the product will probably account for
only a small percentage of the company’s total sales and earnings. The prod-
uct is simply a small drop in a bucket that’s now just too big.
Excessive Stock Splits May Hurt
From time to time, companies make the mistake of splitting their stocks
excessively. This is sometimes done on advice from Wall Street investment
bankers. In my opinion, it’s usually better for a company to split its shares
2-for-1 or 3-for-2 than to split them 3-for-1 or 5-for-1. (When a stock splits
2-for-1, you get two shares for each share you previously held, but the new
shares sell for half the price.) Oversized splits create a substantially larger
supply and may put a company in the more lethargic, big-cap status
sooner.
Incidentally, a stock will usually end up moving higher after its first split
in a new bull market. But before it moves up, it will go through a correction
for a period of weeks.
It may be unwise for a company whose stock has gone up in price for a
year or two to declare an extravagant split near the end of a bull market or
in the early stage of a bear market. Yet this is exactly what many corpora-
tions do.
Generally speaking, these companies feel that lowering the share price
of their stock will attract more buyers. This may be the case with some
smaller buyers, but it also may produce the opposite result—more sell-
ers—especially if it’s the second split within a year or two. Knowledgeable
pros and a few shrewd individual traders will probably use the excitement

generated by the oversized split as an opportunity to sell and take their
profits. In addition, large holders who are thinking of selling might figure it
will be easier to unload their 100,000 shares before a 3-for-1 split than to
sell 300,000 shares afterward. And smart short sellers pick on stocks that
are heavily owned by institutions and are starting to falter after huge price
run-ups.
A stock will often reach a price top around the second or third time it
splits. Our study of the biggest winners found that only 18% of them had
splits in the year preceding their great price advances. Qualcomm topped in
December 1999, just after its 4-for-1 stock split.
Look for Companies Buying Their Own Stock
in the Open Market
In most but not all cases, it’s usually a good sign when a company, especially
a small- to medium-sized growth company that meets the CAN SLIM crite-
ria, buys its own stock in the open market consistently over a period of time.
(A 10% buyback would be considered big.) This reduces the number of
shares and usually implies that the company expects improved sales and
earnings in the future.
As a result of the buyback, the company’s net income will be divided by a
smaller number of shares, thereby increasing earnings per share. And as
already noted, the percentage increase in earnings per share is one of the
principal driving forces behind outstanding stocks.
From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, Tandy, Teledyne, and Metrome-
dia successfully repurchased their own stock, and all three achieved higher
EPS growth and spectacular stock gains. Charles Tandy once told me that
when the market went into a correction, and his stock was down, he would
go to the bank and borrow money to buy back his stock, then repay the loans
after the market recovered. Of course, this was also when his company was
reporting steady growth in earnings.
Tandy’s (split-adjusted) stock increased from $2.75 to $60 in 1983, Metro-
media’s soared from $30 in 1971 to $560 in 1977, and Teledyne zoomed
from $8 in 1971 to $190 in 1984. Teledyne used eight separate buybacks to
shrink its capitalization from 88 million shares to 15 million and increase its
earnings from $0.61 a share to nearly $20.
In 1989 and 1990, International Game Technology announced that it was
buying back 20% of its stock. By September 1993, IGT had advanced more
than 20 times. Another big winner, home builder NVR Inc., had large buy-
backs in 2001. All these were growth companies. I’m not sure that company
buybacks when earnings are not growing are all that sound.

A WINNING SYSTEM
A Low Corporate Debt-to-Equity Ratio Is Generally Better
After you’ve found a stock with a reasonable number of shares, check the
percentage of the company’s total capitalization represented by long-term
debt or bonds. Usually, the lower the debt ratio, the safer and better the
company. The earnings per share of companies with high debt-to-equity
ratios could be clobbered in difficult periods when interest rates are high or
during more severe recessions. These highly leveraged companies are gen-
erally of lower quality and carry substantially higher risk.
The use of extreme leverage of up to 40-to-1 or 50-to-1 was common
among banks, brokers, mortgage lenders, and quasi-government agencies
like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac starting in 1995 and continuing until
2007. These institutions were strongly encouraged by the federal govern-
ment’s actions to invest large amounts of money in subprime loans to lower-
income buyers, which ultimately led to the financial and credit crisis in 2008.
Rule 1 for all competent investors and homeowners is never
ever borrow more than you can pay back. Excessive debt
hurts all people, companies, and governments.
A corporation that’s been reducing its debt as a percentage of equity over
the last two or three years is worth considering. If nothing else, interest
costs will be sharply reduced, helping to generate higher earnings per share.
Another thing to watch for is the presence of convertible bonds in the
capital structure; earnings could be diluted if and when the bonds are con-
verted into shares of common stock.
Evaluating Supply and Demand
The best way to measure a stock’s supply and demand is by watching its daily
trading volume. This is exceptionally important, and it’s why Investor’s Busi-
ness Daily’s stock tables show both a stock’s volume of trading for the day
and the percentage that volume is above or below the stock’s average daily
volume over the last three months. These measurements, plus a proprietary
rating of the degree of recent accumulation or distribution in the stock, are
invaluable pieces of information that are available in no other daily publica-
tion, including the Wall Street Journal.
When a stock pulls back in price, you typically want to see volume dry up
at some point, indicating that there is no further significant selling pressure.
When the stock rallies in price, in most situations you want to see volume
rise, which usually represents buying by institutions, not the public.
When a stock breaks out of a price consolidation area (see Chapter 2 on
chart reading and identifying the price patterns of winning stocks), trading

185
S = Supply and Demand: Big Volume Demand at Key Points
volume should be at least 40% or 50% above normal. In many cases, it will
increase 100% or much more for the day, indicating solid buying of the stock
and the possibility for further increases in price. Using daily and weekly
charts helps you analyze and interpret a stock’s price and volume action.
Monthly charts are also of value.
You should analyze a stock’s base pattern week by week, beginning with
the first week that the stock closes down in a newly formed base and contin-
uing each week until you get to the current week, where you believe it may
break out of the base. You want to judge how much price progress up or
down the stock made during each week and whether it was on increased or
decreased volume from the prior week. You also want to note where the
stock closed within the price spread of each week’s high and low. You both do
a week-by-week check and evaluate the pattern’s overall shape to see if it is a
sound pattern that’s been under accumulation or if it has too many defects.
Remember:Stock of any size capitalization can be bought using the CAN SLIM
system. But small-cap stocks will be substantially more volatile, both on the
upside and on the downside. From time to time, the market will shift its empha-
sis from small to large caps and vice versa. Companies that are buying back their
stock in the open market and that show considerable stock ownership by man-
agement are preferred.

L = Leader or Laggard:
Which Is Your Stock?
People tend to buy stocks that make them feel either good or comfortable. But
in a bull market populated by dynamic leaders that just keep surprising
on the upside, these sentimental favorites often turn out to be the dullest
laggards.
Suppose you want to own a stock in the computer industry. If you buy the
best performer in the group, and your timing is right, you have a crack at
real price appreciation. But if you buy a stock that hasn’t moved much, or
that has even fallen to a price that makes it seem like a bargain and there-
fore safer, chances are that you’ve picked a stock with little potential.
There’s a reason, after all, that it’s at the bottom of the pile.
Don’t just dabble in stocks, buying what you like for whatever reason. Dig
in, do some detective work, and find out what makes some stocks go up
much more than others. You can do it, if you work at it.
Buy Among the Best Two or Three Stocks in a Group
The top one, two, or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbe-
lievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir.
The great computer stocks in the bull market of 1979 and 1980—Wang
Labs, Prime Computer, Datapoint, Rolm, and Tandy—had five-, six-, and
sevenfold advances before they topped and retreated. But the sentimental
favorite, grand old IBM, just sat there, and giants Burroughs, NCR, and
Sperry Rand were just as lifeless. In the bull market of 1981–1983, however,
IBM sprang to life and produced excellent results.

In the retail sector, Home Depot advanced 10 times from 1988 to 1992,
while the laggards in the home-improvement niche, Waban and Hechinger,
dramatically underperformed.
You should buy the really great companies—those that lead their indus-
tries and are number one in their particular fields. All of my best big win-
ners—Syntex in 1963, Pic ‘N’ Save from 1976 to 1983, Price Co. from 1982
to 1985, Franklin Resources from 1985 to 1986, Genentech from 1986 to
1987, Amgen from 1990 to 1991, America Online from 1998 to 1999,
Charles Schwab from 1998 to 1999, Sun Microsystems from 1998 to 1999,
Qualcomm in 1999, eBay from 2002 to 2004, Google from 2004 to 2007,
and Apple from 2004 to 2007—were the number one companies in their
industry space at the time I purchased them.
By number one, I don’t mean the largest company or the one with the
most recognized brand name. I mean the one with the best quarterly and
annual earnings growth, the highest return on equity, the widest profit mar-
gins, the strongest sales growth, and the most dynamic stock-price action.
This type of company will also have a unique and superior product or ser-
vice and be gaining market share from its older, less-innovative competitors.
Avoid Sympathy Stock Moves
Our studies show that very little in the stock market is really new; history
just keeps repeating itself.
When I first bought stock in Syntex, the developer of the birth-control
pill, in July 1963 off a high, tight flag pattern (and it then rapidly shot up
400%), most people wouldn’t touch it. The stock had just made a new price
high at $100 on the American Stock Exchange, and its price plus its P/E
ratio, 45, made it seem too high and scary. No brokerage firms had research
reports on it then, and the only mutual fund that owned it—a Value Line
fund—had sold it the prior quarter when it began moving up. Instead, sev-
eral Wall Street investment firms later recommended G. D. Searle as a
“sympathy play.” Searle had a product similar to Syntex’s, and its stock
looked much cheaper because it hadn’t gone up as much. But its stock failed
to produce the same results. Syntex was the leader; Searle the laggard.
A sympathy play is a stock in the same industry group that is bought in the
hope that the luster of the real leader will rub off on it. But the profits of
such companies usually pale in comparison. The stocks will eventually try to
move up “in sympathy” with the leader, but they never do as well.
In 1970, Levitz Furniture, the leader in the then-new warehouse busi-
ness, became an electrifying market winner. Wickes Corp. copied Levitz,
and many people bought its shares because they were “cheaper,” but Wickes

never performed and ultimately got into financial trouble. Levitz, mean-
while, appreciated 900% before it finally topped.
As steel industry pioneer Andrew Carnegie said in his autobiography:
“The first man gets the oyster; the second, the shell.” Each new business
cycle in America is driven by new innovators, inventors, and entrepreneurs.
If our government really wants to create jobs and not welfare packages,
the most powerful way would be to provide strong tax incentives for the first
two or three years to people who want to start new, small entrepreneurial
businesses. Our data show that in the last 25 years, small businesses in
America were responsible for creating 80% to 90% of all new jobs. This is a
significantly higher percentage than that shown in government data, where
new jobs are not accounted for in a realistic, comprehensive manner.
For example, the Small Business Administration defines a small business
as one with fewer than 500 people. Yes, when Sam Walton started Wal-Mart
and Bill Gates started Microsoft, each company had maybe 30 or 40 people.
A year later they had maybe 75, the next year 120, then 200, then 320, then
501. From that point on, they were no longer considered to be small com-
panies. But over the next 10 or 15 years, one of them created more than a
million jobs and the other 500,000 jobs. Those jobs were all created by a
dynamic entrepreneur who started a brand-new company, and they should
be recognized and counted as such.
We have a huge database on all public companies. In the past 25 years,
big business created no net new jobs. When a big business buys another
company, thereby instantly padding its payrolls, it doesn’t create new jobs.
In fact, it usually consolidates and lays off people in duplicative positions.
Many such companies also downsize over time. Our inefficient, bureau-
cratic government needs to start counting all jobs created by new or small
businesses during their first 15 or 20 years in business.
How to Separate the Leaders from the Laggards:
Using Relative Price Strength
If you own a portfolio of stocks, you must learn to sell the worst performers
first and keep the best a little longer. In other words, always sell your mis-
takes while the loss is still small, and watch your better selections to see if
they progress into your big winners. Human nature being what it is, most
people do it backwards: they hold their losers and sell their winners, a for-
mula that always leads to bigger losses.
How do you tell which stock is better and which is worse? The fastest
and easiest way is by checking its Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating in
Investor’s Business Daily.

L = Leader or Laggard: Which Is Your Stock?
The proprietary RS Rating measures the price performance of a given
stock against the rest of the market for the past 52 weeks. Every stock in
the market is assigned a rating from 1 to 99, with 99 being best. An RS
Rating of 99 means that the stock has outperformed 99% of all other
companies in terms of price performance. A RS of 50 means that half of
all other stocks have done better and half have done worse.
If your stock’s RS Rating is below 70, it is lagging the better-performing
stocks in the overall market. That doesn’t mean that it can’t go up in price.
It just means that if by some chance it does go up, it’ll probably go up less.
From the early 1950s through 2008, the average RS Rating of the best-
performing stocks beforetheir major run-ups was 87. In other words, the
best stocks were already doing better than nearly 9 out of 10 others when
they were starting out on their most explosive advance yet. So the rule for
those who are determined to be big winners in the stock market is: look
for the genuine leaders and avoid laggards and sympathy plays. Don’t buy
stocks with Relative Strength Ratings in the 40s, 50s, or 60s.
The Relative Price Strength Rating is shown each day for all stocks listed
inInvestor’s Business Daily’s stock tables. You can’t find this information in
any other daily business or local newspaper. Updated RS Ratings are also
shown on the Daily Graphs Online charting service.
A stock’s relative strength can also be plotted on a chart. If the RS line has
been sinking for seven months or more, or if the line has an abnormally
sharp decline for four months or more, the stock’s price behavior is highly
questionable, and it should probably be sold.
Pick 80s and 90s That Are in Sound and
Proper Chart Base Patterns
If you want to upgrade your stock selection so that you’re zeroing in on the
leaders, restrict your purchases to companies showing RS Ratings of 80 or
higher. There’s no point in buying a stock that’s straggling behind. Yet that’s
exactly what many investors do—including some who work at America’s
largest investment firms.
I don’t like to buy stocks with Relative Price Strength Ratings less than
80. In fact, the really big moneymakers generally have RS Ratings of 90 or
higher just before they break out of their first or second base structure. The
RS Rating of a potential winning stock should be in the same league as a
pitcher’s fastball. The average big-league fastball is clocked at 86 miles per
hour, and the best pitchers throw “heat” in the 90s.

A WINNING SYSTEM
When you buy a stock, make absolutely sure that it’s coming out of a
sound base or price consolidation area. Also make sure that you buy it at its
exact buy, or pivot, point. As mentioned before, avoid buying stocks that are
extended more than 5% or 10% above the precise initial buy point. This will
keep you from chasing stocks that race up in price too rapidly and makes it
less likely that you will be shaken out during sharp market sell-offs.
The unwillingness of investors to set and follow minimum standards for
stock selection reminds me of doctors years ago who were ignorant of the
need to sterilize their instruments before each operation. They kept killing
off patients until surgeons finally and begrudgingly accepted studies by
researchers Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister. Ignorance rarely pays off in
any walk of life, and it’s no different in the stock market.
Finding New Leaders during Market Corrections
Corrections, or price declines, in the general market can help you recognize
new leaders—if you know what to look for. The more desirable growth
stocks normally correct 1½ to 2½ times the general market averages. In
other words, if the overall market comes down 10%, the better growth
stocks will correct 15% to 25%. However, in a correction during a bull, or
upward-trending, market, the growth stocks that decline the least (percent-
agewise) are usually your best selections. Those that drop the most are nor-
mally the weakest.
Say the general market average suffers an intermediate-term correction
of 10%, and three of your successful growth stocks come off 15%, 25%, and
35%. The two that are off only 15% or 25% are likely to be your best invest-
ments after they recover. A stock that slides 35% to 40% in a general market
decline of 10% could be flashing a warning signal. In most cases, you should
heed it.
Once a general market decline is definitely over, the first stocks that
bounce back to new price highs are almost always your authentic leaders.
These chart breakouts continue week by week for about 13 weeks. The best
ones usually come out in the first three or four weeks. This is the ideal period
to buy stocks . . . you absolutely don’t want to miss it. Be sure to read the
chapter on general market direction carefully to learn how you determine it.
Pros Make Many Mistakes Too
Many professional investment managers make the serious mistake of buying
stocks that have just suffered unusually large price drops. Our studies indi-
cate that this is a surefire way to get yourself in trouble.

L = Leader or Laggard: Which Is Your Stock?
In June 1972, an otherwise capable institutional investor in Maryland
bought Levitz Furniture after its first abnormal price break—a one-week
drop from $60 to around $40. The stock rallied for a few weeks, then rolled
over and broke to $18.
In October 1978, several institutional investors bought Memorex, a lead-
ing supplier of computer peripheral equipment, when it had its first unusual
price break and looked to be a real value. It later plunged.
In September 1981, certain money managers in New York bought Dome
Petroleum on a break from $16 to $12. To them, it seemed cheap, and a
favorable story about the stock was going around Wall Street. Months later,
Dome sold for $1.
Institutional buyers snapped up Lucent Technologies, a Wall Street dar-
ling after it was spun off from AT&T in the mid-1990s, after it broke from
$78 to $50. Later that year, it collapsed to $5.
Also in 2000, many people bought Cisco Systems when it dropped to 50
from its early-year high of 82. The maker of computer networking equipment
had been a huge winner in the 1990s, when it soared 75,000%, so it looked
cheap at $50. It went to $8 and never got back to $50. In 2008, eight years after
those buyers saw value at $50, Cisco was selling for only $17. To do well in the
stock market, you’ve got to stop doing what got you into trouble in the past and
create new and far better rules and methods to guide you in the future.
Suppose Joe Investor missed buying Crocs, the footwear company, at a
split-adjusted $15 as it came out of the perfect cup-with-handle pattern in
September 2006. Suppose he also missed the next cup pattern in April 2007
at 28. Then the stock roars up to $75 by October, with earnings up 100%
every quarter. A month later, however, the stock drops to 47, and Joe sees
his chance to get into this big winner that he missed all the way up and that’s
now at a cheaper price. But the stock just keeps falling, and by January 2009
it’s trading at $1. Buying stocks on the way down is dangerous. You can get
wiped out. So stop this risky bad habit.
How about buying a blue chip, a top-flight bank that’s a leader in its
industry—Bank of America? In December 2006, it was $55 a share, but you
could have gotten it cheaper a year later at $40. Another year later, however,
it had plunged to $6. But you’re still a long-term investor, getting your 4-
cent dividend.
This is why I say don’t buy a supposed good stock on the way down and
why we recommend cutting all losses at 7% or 8%. Any stock can do any-
thing. You must have rules to protect your hard-earned money. We all make
mistakes. You must learn to correct yours without vacillating.
None of the pros or individual investors who owned or bought Cisco,
Crocs, or BofA when they were falling recognized the difference between

normal price declines and highly abnormal big-volume corrections that can
signal potential disaster. But the real problem was they relied on stories
they’d heard and a method of fundamental analysis that equates lower P/E
ratios with “value.” They didn’t heed the market action that could have told
them what was really going on.
Those who listen and learn the difference between normal and abnormal
action are said to have a “good feel for the market.” Those who ignore what
the market says usually pay a heavy price. Anyone who buys stocks on the
way down in price because they look cheap will learn the hard way this is
how you can lose a lot of money.
Look for Abnormal Strength on a Weak Market Day
In the spring of 1967, I remember walking through a broker’s office in New
York on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than
12 points. That was a lot in those days, when the Dow was around 800 com-
pared with 8,000 in 2008. When I looked up at the electronic ticker tape
moving across the wall and showing prices, I saw that Control Data—a pio-
neer in supercomputers—was trading at $62, up 3½ points on heavy vol-
ume. I bought the stock at once. I knew Control Data well, and this was
highly abnormal strength in the face of a weak overall market. The stock
later ran up to $150.
In April 1981, just as the 1981 bear market was getting underway, MCI
Communications, a telecommunications stock trading in the over-the-
counter market, broke out of a price base at $15. It advanced to the equiva-
lent of $90 in 21 months. This was another great example of highly abnormal
strength during a weak market.
Lorillard, the tobacco company, did the same thing in the 1957 bear mar-
ket, Software Toolworks soared in the down market of early 1990, wireless
telecom firm Qualcomm made big progress even during the difficult
midyear market of 1999, and Taro Pharmaceutical late in 2000 bucked the
bear market that had begun that spring. Also in 2000, home builder NVR
took off at $50 and rode steadily lower interest rates up to $360 by March
2003. The new bull market in 2003 uncovered many leaders, including
Apple, Google, Research in Motion, Potash, and several Chinese stocks.
So don’t forget: It seldom pays to invest in laggard stocks, even if they look
tantalizingly cheap. Look for, and confine your purchases to, market leaders. Get
out of your laggard losers if you’re down 8% below the price you paid so that you
won’t risk getting badly hurt.

• CHAPTER •
I = Institutional Sponsorship
It takes big demand to push up prices, and by far the biggest source of demand
for stocks is institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds,
hedge funds, insurance companies, large investment counselors, bank trust
departments, and state, charitable, and educational institutions. These large
investors account for the lion’s share of each day’s market activity.
What Is Institutional Sponsorship?
Institutional sponsorship refers to the shares of any stock owned by such
institutions. For measurement purposes, I have never considered brokerage
research reports or analyst recommendations as institutional sponsorship,
although a few may exert short-term influence on some securities for a few
days. Investment advisory services and market newsletters also aren’t con-
sidered to be institutional or professional sponsorship by this definition
because they lack the concentrated or sustained buying or selling power of
institutional investors.
A winning stock doesn’t need a huge number of institutional owners, but
it should have several at a minimum. Twenty might be a reasonable mini-
mum number in a few rare cases involving small or newer companies,
although most stocks have many, many more. If a stock has no professional
sponsorship, chances are that its performance will be more run-of-the-mill,
as this means that at least some of the more than 10,000 institutional
investors have looked at the stock and passed over it. Even if they’re wrong,
it still takes large buying volume to stimulate an important price increase.

Look for Both Quality and Increasing
Numbers of Buyers
Diligent investors dig down yet another level. They want to know not
only how many institutional sponsors a stock has, whether that number
has steadily increased in recent quarters, and, more importantly,
whether the most recent quarter showed a materially larger increase in
the number of owners. They also want to know who those sponsors are,
as shown by services reporting this information. They look for stocks that
are held by at least one or two of the more savvy portfolio managers who
have the best performance records. This is referred to as analyzing the
quality of sponsorship.
In analyzing the recorded quality of a stock’s institutional sponsorship,
the latest 12 months plus the last three years of the investment performance
of mutual fund sponsors are usually most relevant. A quick and easy way to
get this information is by checking a mutual fund’s 36-Month Performance
Rating in Investor’s Business Daily. An A+ rating indicates that a fund is in
the top 5% in terms of performance. Funds with ratings of B+ or higher are
considered the better performers. Keep in mind that the rating of a good
growth stock mutual fund may be a little lower during a bear market, when
most growth stocks will definitely correct.
Results may change significantly, however, if key portfolio managers leave
one money-management firm and go to another. The leaders in the ratings
of top institutional mutual funds generally rotate and change slowly as the
years go by.
Several financial services publish fund holdings and the investment per-
formance records of various institutions. For example, you can learn the top
25 holdings of each fund plus other data at Morningstar.com. In the past,
mutual funds tended to be more aggressive in the market. More recently,
new “entrepreneurial-type” investment-counseling firms have cropped up
to manage public and institutional money.
Buy Companies That Show Increasing Sponsorship
As mentioned earlier, it’s less crucial to know how many institutions own a
stock than to know whichof the limited number of better-performing insti-
tutions own a stock or have bought it recently. It’s also key to know whether
the total number of sponsors is increasing or decreasing. The main thing to
look for is the recent quarterly trend. It’s always best to buy stocks showing
strong earnings and sales and an increasing number of institutional owners
over several recent quarters.

I = Institutional Sponsorship
Note New Stock Positions Bought in the Last Quarter
A significant new position taken by an institutional investor in the most
recently reported period is generally more relevant than existing positions
that have been held for some time. When a fund establishes a new position,
chances are that it will continue to add to that position and be less likely to
sell it in the near future. Reports on such activities are available about six
weeks after the end of a fund’s three- or six-month period. They are helpful
to those who can identify the wiser picks and who understand correct tim-
ing and proper analysis of daily and weekly charts.
Many investors feel that disclosures of a fund’s new commitments are
published too long after the fact to be of any real value. But these individual
opinions typically aren’t correct.
Institutional trades also tend to show up on some ticker tapes as transac-
tions of from 1,000 to 100,000 shares or more. Institutional buying and selling
can account for up to 70% of the activity in the stocks of most leading compa-
nies. This is the sustained force behind most major price moves. About half of
the institutional buying that shows up on the New York Stock Exchange ticker
tape may be in humdrum stocks. Much of it may also be wrong. But out of the
other half, you may have several truly phenomenal selections.
Your task, then, is to separate intelligent, highly informed institutional
buying from poor, faulty buying. This is hard at first, but it will get easier as
you learn to apply and follow the proven rules, guidelines, and principles
presented in this book.
To get a better sense for what works in the market, it’s important to study
the investment strategies of a well-managed mutual fund. When reviewing
the tables in Investor’s Business Daily, look for growth funds with A, A-, or
B+ ratings during bull markets and then call to obtain a prospectus. From
the prospectus, you’ll learn the investment philosophy and techniques used
by the individual funds as well as the type and caliber of stocks they’ve pur-
chased. For example:
• Fidelity’s Contrafund, managed by Will Danoff, has been the best-per-
forming large, multibillion-dollar fund for a number of years. He scours
the country and international equities to get in early on every new con-
cept or story in a stock.
• Jim Stower’s American Century Heritage and Gift Trust funds use com-
puters to find aggressive stocks with accelerating percentage increases in
recent sales and earnings.
• Ken Heebner’s CGM Focus and CGM Mutual have both had superior
results for many years. His Focus fund concentrates in only 20 stocks.

This makes it more volatile, but Ken likes to make big sector bets that in
most cases have worked very well for him.
• Jeff Vinick was a top-flight manager at Fidelity who left and started what
is regarded as one of the country’s best-performing hedge funds.
• Janus 20, headquartered in Denver, runs a concentrated portfolio of
fewer than 30 growth stocks.
Some funds buy on new highs; others buy around lows and may sell on
new highs.
Is Your Stock “Overowned” by Institutions?
It’s possible for a stock to have too much institutional sponsorship.
Overownedis a term we coined in 1969 to describe stocks in which institu-
tional ownership has become excessive. The danger is that excessive spon-
sorship might translate into large potential selling if something goes wrong
at the company or if a bear market begins.
Janus Funds alone owned more than 250 million shares of Nokia and 100
million shares of America Online, which contributed to an adverse supply/
demand imbalance in 2000 and 2001. WorldCom (in 1999) and JDS Uniphase
and Cisco Systems (in 2000 and 2001) were other examples of overowned
stocks.
Thus, the “Favorite 50” and other widely owned institutional stocks can
be poor, risky prospects. By the time a company’s strong performance is so
obvious that almost all institutions own the stock, it’s probably too late to
climb aboard. The heart is already out of the watermelon.
Look how many institutions thought Citigroup should be a core holding
in the late 1990s and 2000s. At one point during the 2008 bank subprime
loan and credit crisis, the stock of this leading New York City bank got down
to $3.00 and later $1.00. Only two years earlier it was $57. This is why, since
its first edition, How to Make Money in Stockshas always had two detailed
chapters on the subject of when to sell your stock. Most investors have no
rules or plan for when to sell. That is a serious mistake.
The same goes for American International Group. In 2008, AIG had
more than 3,600 institutional owners when it tanked to 50 cents from the
over $100 it had sold for in 2000. The government-sponsored Fannie Mae
collapsed to less than a dollar during the same financial fiasco.
America Online in the summer of 2001 and Cisco Systems in the summer of
2000 were also overowned by more than a thousand institutions. This potential
heavy supply can adversely affect a stock during bear market periods. Many
funds will pile into certain leaders on the way up and pile out on the way down.

An Unassailable Institutional Growth Stock Tops
Some stocks may seem invincible, but the old saying is true: what goes up
must eventually come down. No company is forever immune to manage-
ment problems, economic slowdowns, and changes in market direction.
Savvy investors know that in the stock market, there are few “sacred cows.”
And there are certainly no guarantees.
In June 1974, few people could believe it when William O’Neil + Co. put
Xerox on its institutional avoid or sell list at $115. Until then, Xerox had
been one of the most amazingly successful and widely held institutional
stocks, but our data indicated that it had topped and was headed down. It
was also overowned. Institutional investors went on to make Xerox their
most widely purchased stock for that year. But when the stock tumbled in
price, it showed the true condition of the company at that time.
That episode called attention to our institutional services firm and got us
our first major insurance company account in New York City. The firm had
been buying Xerox in the $80s on the way down until we persuaded it that
it should be selling instead.
We also received a lot of resistance in 1998 when we put Gillette, another
sacred cow, on our avoid list near $60 before it tanked. Enron was removed
from our new ideas list on November 29, 2000, at $72.91, and we stopped
following it. (Six months later it was $45, and six months after that it was
below $5 and headed for bankruptcy.)
Here is a list of some of the technology stocks that were removed from
our New Stock Market Ideas (NSMI) institutional service potential new
ideas list in 2000, when most analysts were incorrectly calling them buys.
The lesson: don’t be swayed by a stock’s broad-based popularity or an ana-
lyst advising investors to buy stocks on the way down in price.
Institutional Sponsorship Means Market Liquidity
Another benefit to you as an individual investor is that institutional sponsor-
ship provides buying support when you want to sell your investment. If
there’s no sponsorship, and you try to sell your stock in a poor market, you
may have problems finding someone to buy it. Daily marketability is one of
the big advantages of owning high-quality stocks in the United States. (Real
estate is far less liquid, and sales commissions and fees are much higher.)
Good institutional sponsorship provides continuous liquidity for you. In a
poor real estate market, there is no guarantee that you can find a willing
buyer when you want to sell. It could take you six months to a year, and you
could sell for a much lower price than you expected.

ber of sponsors, but that none of the sponsors is on my list of the 10 or so
excellent-performing funds, in the majority of cases I will pass over the
stock. Institutional sponsorship is one more important tool to use as you
analyze a stock for purchase.

M = Market Direction:
How You Can Determine It
You can be right about every one of the factors in the last six chapters, but if you’re
wrong about the direction of the general market, and that direction is down,
three out of four of your stocks will plummet along with the market aver-
ages, and you will certainly lose money big time, as many people did in 2000
and again in 2008. Therefore, in your analytical tool kit, you absolutely must
have a proven, reliable method to accurately determine whether you’re in a
bull (uptrending) market or a bear (downtrending) market. Very few
investors or stockbrokers have such an essential tool. Many investors
depend on someone else to help them with their investments. Do these
other advisors or helpers have a sound set of rules to determine when the
general market is starting to get into trouble?
That’s not enough, however. If you’re in a bull market, you need to
know whether it’s in the early stage or a later stage. And more importantly,
you need to know what the market is doing right now. Is it weak and act-
ing badly, or is it merely going through a normal intermediate decline
(typically 8% to 12%)? Is it doing just what it should be, considering the
basic current conditions in the country, or is it acting abnormally strong or
weak? To answer these and other vital questions, you’ll want to learn to
analyze the overall market correctly, and to do that, you must start at the
most logical point.
The market direction method that we discovered and developed many
years ago is such a key element in successful investing that you’ll want to
reread this chapter several times until you understand and can apply it on a
day-to-day basis for the rest of your investment life. If you learn to do this

well, you should never in the future find your investment portfolio down
30% to 50% or more in a bad bear market.
The best way for you to determine the direction of the market is to look
carefully at, follow, interpret, and understand the daily charts of the three or
four major general market averages and what their price and volume
changes are doing on a day-to-day basis. This might sound intimidating at
first, but with patience and practice, you’ll soon be analyzing the market like
a true pro. This is the most important lesson you can learn if you want to
stop losing and start winning. Are you ready to get smarter? Are your future
peace of mind and financial independence worth some extra effort and
determination on your part?
Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t time the market. This is a
giant myth passed on mainly by Wall Street, the media, and those who have
never been able to do it, so they think it’s impossible. We’ve heard from
thousands of readers of this chapter and Investor’s Business Daily’sThe Big
Picturecolumn who have learned how to do it. They took the time to read
the rules and do their homework so that they were prepared and knew
exactly what facts to look for. As a result, they had the foresight and under-
standing to sell stocks and raise cash in March 2000 and from November
2007 to January 2008 and June 2008, protecting much of the gains they
made during 1998 and 1999 and in the strong five-year bull market in stocks
that lasted from March 2003 to June 2008.
The erroneous belief that you can’t time the market—that it’s simply
impossible, that no one can do it—evolved more than 40 years ago after a
few mutual fund managers tried it unsuccessfully. They had to both sell at
exactly the right time and then get back into the market at exactly the right
time. But because of their asset size problems, and because they had no sys-
tem, it took a number of weeks for them to believe the turn and finally reen-
ter the market. They relied on their personal judgments and feelings to
determine when the market finally hit bottom and turned up for real. At the
bottom, the news is all negative. So these managers, being human, hesitated
to act. Their funds therefore lost some relative performance during the fast
turnarounds that frequently happen at market bottoms.
For this reason, and despite the fact that twice in the 1950s, Jack Dreyfus
successfully raised cash in his Dreyfus Fund at the start of a bear market,
top management at most mutual funds imposed rigid rules on money man-
agers that required them to remain fully invested (95% to 100% of assets).
This possibly fits well with the sound concept that mutual funds are truly
long-term investments. Also, because funds are typically widely diversified
(owning a hundred or more stocks spread among many industries), in time
they will always recover when the market recovers. So owning them for 15

What Is the General Market?
Thegeneral marketis a term referring to the most commonly used market
indexes. These broad indexes tell you the approximate strength or weakness
in each day’s overall trading activity and can be one of your earliest indica-
tions of emerging trends. They include
• The Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500. Consisting of 500 companies, this index
is a broader, more modern representation of market action than the Dow.
• The Nasdaq Composite.This has been a somewhat more volatile and rel-
evant index in recent years. The Nasdaq is home to many of the market’s
younger, more innovative, and faster-growing companies that trade via
the Nasdaq network of market makers. It’s a little more weighted toward
the technology sector.
• The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). This index consists of 30
widely traded big-cap stocks. It used to focus primarily on large, cyclical,
industrial issues, but it has broadened a little in recent years to include
companies such as Coca-Cola and Home Depot. It’s a simple but rather
out-of-date average to study because it’s dominated by large, established,
old-line companies that grow more slowly than today’s more entrepre-
neurial concerns. It can also be easily manipulated over short time peri-
ods because it’s limited to only 30 stocks.
• The NYSE Composite. This is a market-value-weighted index of all stocks
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
All these key indexes are shown in Investor’s Business Daily in large,
easy-to-analyze charts that also feature a moving average and an Accumula-
tion/Distribution Rating (ACC/DIS RTG®) for each index. The Accumulation/
Distribution Rating tells you if the index has been getting buying support
recently or is undergoing significant selling. I always try to check these
indexes every day because a key change can occur over just a few weeks, and
you don’t want to be asleep at the switch and not see it. IBD’s “The Big Pic-
ture” column also evaluates these indexes daily to materially help you in
deciphering the market’s current condition and direction.

Why Is Skilled, Careful Market Observation So Important?
A Harvard professor once asked his students to do a special report on fish.
His scholars went to the library, read books about fish, and then wrote their
expositions. But after turning in their papers, the students were shocked
when the professor tore them up and threw them in the wastebasket.
When they asked him what was wrong with the reports, the professor said,
“If you want to learn anything about fish, sit in front of a fishbowl and look at
fish.” He made his students sit and watch fish for hours. Then they rewrote
their assignment solely on their observations of the objects themselves.
Being a student of the market is like being a student in this professor’s class:
if you want to learn about the market, you must observe and study the major
indexes carefully. In doing so, you’ll come to recognize when the daily market
averages are changing at key turning points—such as major market tops and
bottoms—and learn to capitalize on this with real knowledge and confidence.
There’s an important lesson here. To be highly accurate in any pursuit,
you must observe and analyze the objects themselves carefully. If you want
to know about tigers, you need to watch tigers—not the weather, not the
vegetation, and not the other animals on the mountain.
Years ago, when Lou Brock set his mind to breaking baseball’s stolen base
record, he had all the big-league pitchers photographed with high-speed
film from the seats behind first base. Then he studied the film to learn what
part of each pitcher’s body moved first when he threw to first base. The
pitcher was the object that Brock was trying to beat, so it was the pitchers
themselves that he studied in great detail.
In the 2003 Super Bowl, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were able to inter-
cept five Oakland Raider passes by first studying and then concentrating on
the eye movements and body language of Oakland’s quarterback. They
“read” where he was going to throw.
Christopher Columbus didn’t accept the conventional wisdom about the
earth being flat because he himself had observed ships at sea disappearing
over the horizon in a way that told him otherwise. The government uses
wiretaps, spy planes, unmanned drones, and satellite photos to observe and
analyze objects that could threaten our security. That’s how we discovered
Soviet missiles in Cuba.
It’s the same with the stock market. To know which way it’s going, you
must observe and analyze the major general market indexes daily. Don’t
ever, ever ask anyone: “What do you think the market’s going to do?” Learn
to accurately read what the market is actually doing each day as it is doing it.
Recognizing when the market has hit a top or has bottomed out is fre-
quently 50% of the whole complicated investment ball game. It’s also the

key investing skill virtually all investors, whether amateur or professional,
seem to lack. In fact, Wall Street analysts completely missed calling the mar-
ket top in 2000, particularly the tops in every one of the high-technology
leaders. They didn’t do much better in 2008.
We conducted four surveys of IBD subscribers in 2008 and also received
hundreds of letters from subscribers that led us to believe that 60% of IBD
readers sold stock and raised cash in either December 2007 or June 2008
with the help of “The Big Picture” column and by applying and acting on
our rule about five or six distribution days over any four- or five-week
period. They preserved their capital and avoided the brunt of the dramatic
and costly market collapse in the fall of 2008 that resulted from excessive
problems in the market for subprime mortgage real estate loans (which had
been sponsored and strongly encouraged by the government). You may
have seen some of our subscribers’ comments in IBD at the top of a page
space titled “You Can Do It Too.” You’ll learn exactly how to apply IBD’s
general market distribution rules later in this chapter.
The Stages of a Stock Market Cycle
The winning investor should understand how a normal business cycle
unfolds and over what period of time. The investor should pay particular
attention to recent cycles. There’s no guarantee that just because cycles
lasted three or four years in the past, they’ll last that long in the future.
Bull and bear markets don’t end easily. It usually takes two or three tricky
pullbacks up or down to fake out or shake out the few remaining specula-
tors. After everyone who can be run in or run out has thrown in the towel,
there isn’t anyone left to take action in the same market direction. Then the
market will finally turn and begin a whole new trend. Most of this is crowd
psychology constantly at work.
Bear markets usually end while business is still in a downtrend. The rea-
son is that stocks are anticipating, or “discounting,” all economic, political,
and worldwide events many months in advance. The stock market is a lead-
ingeconomic indicator, not a coincidentorlaggingindicator, in our govern-
ment’s series of key economic indicators. The market is exceptionally
perceptive, taking all events and basic conditions into account. It will react
to what is taking place and what it can mean for the nation. The market is
not controlled by Wall Street. Its action is determined by millions of
investors all across the country and thousands of large institutions and is a
consensus conclusion on whether it likes or doesn’t like what it foresees—
such as what our government is doing or about to do and what the conse-
quences could be.

Similarly, bull markets usually top out and turn down before a recession
sets in. For this reason, looking at economic indicators is a poor way to
determine when to buy or sell stocks and is not recommended. Yet, some
investment firms do this very thing.
The predictions of many economists also leave a lot to be desired. A few of
our nation’s presidents have had to learn this lesson the hard way. In early 1983,
for example, just as the economy was in its first few months of recovery, the
head of President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers was concerned that
the capital goods sector was not very strong. This was the first hint that this
advisor might not be as sound as he should be. Had he understood historical
trends, he would have seen that capital goods demand has never been strong
in the early stage of a recovery. This was especially true in the first quarter of
1983, when U.S. plants were operating at a low percentage of capacity.
You should check earlier cycles to learn the sequence of industry-group
moves at various stages of the market cycle. If you do, you’ll see that railroad
equipment, machinery, and other capital goods industries are late movers in
a business or stock market cycle. This knowledge can help you get a fix on
where you are now. When these groups start running up, you know you’re
near the end. In early 2000, computer companies supplying Internet capital
goods and infrastructure were the last-stage movers, along with telecom-
munications equipment suppliers.
Dedicated students of the market who want to learn more about cycles
and the longer-term history of U.S. economic growth may want to write to
Securities Research Company, 27 Wareham Street, #401, Boston, MA
02118, and purchase one of the company’s long-term wall charts. Also, in
2008, Daily Graphs, Inc., created a 1900 to 2008 stock market wall chart
that shows major market and economic events.
Some charts of market averages also include major news events over the
last 12 months. These can be very valuable, especially if you keep and
review back copies. You then have a history of both the market averages and
the events that have influenced their direction. It helps to know, for exam-
ple, how the market has reacted to new faces in the White House, rumors of
war, controls on wages and prices, changes in discount rates, or just loss of
confidence and “panics” in general. The accompanying chart of the S&P
500 Index shows several past cycles with the bear markets shaded.
You Should Study the General Market Indexes Each Day
In bear markets, stocks usually open strong and close weak. In bull markets,
they tend to open weak and close strong. The general market averages need
to be checked every day, since reverses in trends can begin on any given few

days. Relying on these primary indexes is a more direct, practical, and effec-
tive method for analyzing the market’s behavior and determining its direction.
Don’t rely on other, subsidiary indicators because they haven’t been
proven to be effective at timing. Listening to the many market newsletter
writers, technical analysts, or strategists who pore over 30 to 50 different
technical or economic indicators and then tell you what they think the mar-
ket should be doing is generally a very costly waste of time. Investment
newsletters can create doubt and confusion in an investor’s mind. Interest-
ingly enough, history shows that the market tends to go up just when the
news is all bad and these experts are most skeptical and uncertain.
When the general market tops, you must sell to raise at least some cash
and to get off margin (the use of borrowed money) to protect your account.
As an individual investor, you can easily raise cash and get out in one or two
days, and you can likewise reenter later when the market is finally right. If
you don’t sell and raise cash when the general market tops, your diversified
list of former market leaders can decline sharply. Several of them may never
recover to their former levels.
Your best bet is to learn to interpret daily price and volume charts of the
key general market averages. If you do, you can’t get too far off-track, and you
won’t need much else. It doesn’t pay to argue with the market. Experience
teaches that second-guessing the market can be a very expensive mistake.
The Prolonged Two-Year Bear Market of 1973–1974
The combination of the Watergate scandal and hearings and the 1974 oil
embargo by OPEC made 1973–1974 the worst stock market catastrophe up
to that time since the 1929–1933 depression. The Dow corrected 50%, but
the average stock plummeted more than 70%.
This was a big lesson for stockholders and was almost as severe as the
90% correction the average stock showed from 1929 to 1933. However, in
1933, industrial production was only 56% of the 1929 level, and more than
13 million Americans were unemployed. The peak unemployment rate in
the 1930s was 25%. It remained in double digits throughout the entire
decade and was 20% in 1939.
The markets were so demoralized in the prolonged 1973–1974 bear mar-
ket that most members on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange were
afraid the exchange might not survive as a viable institution. This is why it’s
absolutely critical that you study the market averages and learn how to pro-
tect yourself against catastrophic losses, for the sake of your health as well as
your portfolio. You can learn to do this. Anyone can do it, if they get serious
and apply themselves. Is your money important to you?

M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It
A 33% Drop Requires a 50% Rise to Break Even
The importance of knowing the direction of the general market cannot be
overemphasized. If you have a 33% loss in a portfolio of stocks, you need a
50% gain just to get to your breakeven point. If, for example, you’ve allowed
a $10,000 portfolio to drop to $6,666 (a 33% decline), it has to rise $3,333
(or 50%) just to get you back where you started. In the 2007–2008 bear mar-
ket, the S&P 500 fell more than 50%, meaning that a 100% rebound will be
needed for the index to fully recover. And how easy is it for you to make
100%? Maybe it’s time for you to learn what you’re doing, adopt new rules
and methods, and stop doing things that create 50% losses.
You positively must always act to preserve as much as possible of the
profit that you’ve built up during the bull market rather than ride your
investments back down through difficult bear market periods. To do this,
you have to learn historically proven selling rules. (See Chapters 10 and 11
for more on selling rules.)
The Myths about “Long-Term Investing”
and Being Fully Invested
Many investors like to think of, or at least describe, themselves as “long-
term investors.” Their strategy is to stay fully invested through thick and
thin. Most institutions do the same thing. But such an inflexible approach
can have tragic results, particularly for individual investors. Individuals and
institutions alike may get away with standing pat through relatively mild
(25% or less) bear markets, but many bear markets are not mild. Some, such
as 1973–1974, 2000–2002, and 2007–2008, are downright devastating.
The challenge always comes at the beginning, when you start to sense an
impending bear market. In most cases, you cannot project how bad eco-
nomic conditions might become or how long those bad conditions could
linger. The war in Vietnam, inflation, and a tight money supply helped turn
the 1969–1970 correction into a two-year decline of 36.9%. Before that,
bear markets averaged only nine months and took the averages down 26%.
Most stocks fall during a bear market, but not all of them recover. If you
hold on during even a modest bear correction, you can get stuck with dam-
aged merchandise that may never see its former highs. You definitely must
learn to sell and raise at least some cash when the overall environment
changes and your stocks are not working.
Buy-and-hold investors fell in love with Coca-Cola during the 1980s and
1990s. The soft-drink giant chugged higher year after year, rising and falling
with the market. But it stopped working in 1998, as did Gillette, another
favorite of long-term holders. When the market slipped into its mild bear

correction that summer, Coke followed along. Two years later—after some
of the market’s most exciting gains in decades—Coke was still stuck in a
downtrend. In some instances, stocks of this kind may come back. But this
much is certain: Coke investors missed huge advances in 1998 and 1999 in
names such as America Online and Qualcomm.
The buy-and-hold strategy was also disastrous to anyone who held tech-
nology stocks from 2000 through 2002. Many highfliers lost 75% to 90% of
their value, and some may never return to their prior highs. Take a look now
at Time Warner, Corning, Yahoo!, Intel, JDS Uniphase, and EMC, former
market leaders in 1998–2000.
Protecting Yourself from Market Downturns
Napoleon once wrote that never hesitating in battle gave him an advantage
over his opponents, and for many years he was undefeated. In the battle-
field that is the stock market, there are the quick and there are the dead!
After you see the first several definite indications of a market top, don’t
wait around. Sell quickly before real weakness develops. When market
indexes peak and begin major downside reversals, you should act immedi-
ately by putting 25% or more of your portfolio in cash, selling your stocks at
market prices. The use of limit orders (buying or selling at a specific price,
rather than buying or selling at market prices using market orders) is not
recommended. Focus on your ability to get into or out of a stock when you
need to. Quibbling over an eighth- or quarter-point (or their decimal equiv-
alents) could make you miss an opportunity to buy or sell a stock.
Lightning-fast action is even more critical if your stock account is on mar-
gin. If your portfolio is fully margined, with half of the money in your stocks
borrowed from your broker, a 20% decline in the price of your stocks will
cause you to lose 40% of your money. A 50% decline in your stocks could
wipe you out! Never try to ride through a bear market on margin.
In the final analysis, there are really only two things you can do when a
new bear market begins: sell and retreat or go short. When you retreat, you
should stay out until the bear market is over. This usually means five or six
months or more. In the prolonged, problem-ridden 1969–1970 and
1973–1974 periods, however, it meant up to two years. The bear market that
began in March 2000 during the last year of the Clinton administration
lasted longer and was far more severe than normal. Nine out of ten investors
lost a lot of money, particularly in high-tech stocks. It was the end of a
period of many excesses during the late 1990s, a decade when America got
careless and let down its guard. It was the “anything goes” period, with
stocks running wild.

M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It
Selling short can be profitable, but be forewarned: it’s a very difficult and
highly specialized skill that should be attempted only during bear markets.
Few people make money at it. Short selling is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 12.
Using Stop-Loss Orders
If you use stop-loss orders or mentally record a selling price and act upon it,
a market that is starting to top out will mechanically force you, robotlike, out
of many of your stocks. A stop-loss order instructs the specialist in the stock
on the exchange floor that once the stock has dropped to your specified
price, the order becomes a market order, and the stock will be sold out on
the next transaction.
It’s usually better not to enter stop-loss orders. In doing so, you and other
similarly minded investors are showing your hand to market makers, and at
times they might drop the stock to shake out stop-loss orders. Instead,
watch your stocks closely and know ahead of time the exact price at which
you will immediately sell to cut a loss. However, some people travel a lot and
aren’t able to watch their stocks closely, and others have a hard time making
sell decisions and getting out when they are losing. In such cases, stop-loss
orders help compensate for distance and indecisiveness.
If you use a stop-loss order, remember to cancel it if you change your mind
and sell a stock before the order is executed. Otherwise, you could later acci-
dentally sell a stock that you no longer own. Such errors can be costly.
How You Can Learn to Identify Stock Market Tops
To detect a market top, keep a close eye on the daily S&P 500, NYSE Com-
posite, Dow 30, and Nasdaq Composite as they work their way higher. On
one of the days in the uptrend, volume for the market as a whole will
increase from the day before, but the index itself will show stalling action (a
significantly smaller price increase for the day compared with the prior day’s
price increase). I call this “heavy volume without further price progress up.”
The average doesn’t have to close down for the day, but in most instances it
will, making the distribution (selling) as professional investors liquidate
stock must easier to see. The spread from the average’s daily high to its daily
low may in some cases be a little wider than on previous days.
Normal liquidation near the market peak will usually occur on three to
five specific days over a period of four or five weeks. In other words, the
market comes under distribution while it’s advancing! This is one reason so
few people know how to recognize distribution. After four or five days of

==================================================

A WINNING SYSTEM
definite distribution over any span of four or five weeks, the general market
will almost always turn down.
Four days of distribution, if correctly spotted over a two- or three-week
period, are sometimes enough to turn a previously advancing market into a
decline. Sometimes distribution can be spread over six weeks if the market
attempts at some point to rally back to new highs. If you are asleep or
unaware and you miss the topping signals given off by the S&P 500, the
NYSE Composite, the Nasdaq, or the Dow (which is easy to do, since they
sometimes occur on only a few days), you could be wrong about the market
direction and therefore wrong on almost everything you do.
One of the biggest problems is the time it takes to reverse investors’ pos-
itive personal opinions and views. If you always sell and cut your losses 7%
or 8% below your buy points, you may automatically be forced to sell at least
one or two stocks as a correction in the general market starts to develop.
This should get you into a questioning, defensive frame of mind sooner. Fol-
lowing this one simple but powerful rule of ours saved a lot of people big
money in 2000’s devastating decline in technology leaders and in the 2008
subprime loan bear market.
It takes only one of the indexes to give you a valid repeated signal of too
much distribution. You don’t normally need to see several of the major
indexes showing four or five distribution days. Also, if one of the indexes is
down for the day on volume larger than the prior day’s volume, it should
decline more than 0.2% for this to be counted as a distribution day.
After the Initial Decline off the Top,
Track Each Rally Attempt on the Way Down
After the required number of days of increased volume distribution around
the top and the first decline resulting from this, there will be either a poor
rally in the market averages, followed by a rally failure, or a positive and
powerful follow-through day up on price and volume. You should learn in
detail exactly what signals to look for and remain unbiased about the mar-
ket. Let the day-by-day averages tell you what the market has been doing
and is doing. (See “How You Can Spot Stock Market Bottoms” later in this
chapter for a further discussion of market rallies.)
Three Signs the First Rally Attempt May Fail
After the market does top out, it typically will rally feebly and then fail. After
the first day’s rebound, for instance, the second day will open strongly but
suddenly turn down near the end of the session. The abrupt failure of the

market to follow through on its first recovery attempt should probably be
met with further selling on your part.
You’ll know that the initial bounce back is feeble if (1) the index advances
in price on the third, fourth, or fifth rally day, but on volume that is lower than
that of the day before, (2) the average makes little net upward price progress
compared with its progress the day before, or (3) the market average recovers
less than half of the initial drop from its former absolute intraday high. When
you see these weak rallies and failures, further selling is advisable.
How CAN SLIM and IBD Red-Flagged
the March 2000 Nasdaq Top
In October 1999, the market took off on a furious advance. Fears of a Y2K
meltdown on January 1, 2000, had faded. Companies were announcing
strong profits for the third quarter just ended. Both leading tech stocks and
speculative Internet and biotechnology issues racked up huge gains in just
five months. But cracks started to appear in early March 2000.
On March 7, the Nasdaq closed lower on higher volume, the first time it
had done so in more than six weeks. That’s unusual action during a roaring
bull market, but one day of distribution isn’t significant on its own. Still, it
was the first yellow flag and was worth watching carefully.
Three days later, the Nasdaq bolted up more than 85 points to a new high
in the morning. But it reversed in the afternoon and finished the day up only
2 points on heavy volume that was 13% above average. This was the second
warning sign. That churning action (a lot of trading but no real price
progress—a clear sign of distribution) was all the more important because
leading stocks started showing their own symptoms of hitting climax tops—
action that will be discussed in Chapter 11. Just two days later, on March 14,
the market closed down 4% on a large volume increase. This was the third
major warning signal of distribution and one where you should have been
taking some selling action.
The index managed to put together a suspect rally from March 16 to 24,
then stalled again for a fourth distribution day. It soon ran out of steam and
rolled over on heavier volume two days later for a fifth distribution day and
a final, definite confirmation of the March 10 top. The market itself was
telling you to sell, raise cash, and get out of your stocks. All you had to do
was read it right and react, instead of listening to other people’s opinions.
Other people are too frequently wrong and are probably clueless about rec-
ognizing or understanding distribution days.
During the next two weeks, the Nasdaq, along with the S&P 500 and the
Dow, suffered repeated bouts of distribution as the indexes sold off on heav-

ier volume than on the prior day. Astute CAN SLIM investors who had read,
studied, and prepared themselves by knowing exactly what to watch for had
long since taken their profits.

itself when it comes to the stock market; you’ll see this type of action again
and again in the future. So get with it.
How CAN SLIM and IBD Red-Flagged
the 2007 Top in the Market
As mentioned earlier, several surveys showed that approximately 60% of IBD
subscribers sold stock in 2008 before the rapid stock market break occurred.
IBD’s “The Big Picture” column clearly pointed out in its special Market Pulse
box when the market indexes had five distribution days and the outlook had
switched to “Market in correction,” and then the column suggested that it was
time to raise cash. I’m sure most of those people had read and studied this
chapter, including our description of how we retreated from the market in
March 2000. They were finally able to use and apply IBD’s general market
rules to preserve their gains and not have to undergo the severe declines that
can occur when you have no protective rules or methods. And hopefully, those
who didn’t follow the rules will be able to better apply them in the future.
Not too much happens by accident in the market. It requires effort on
your part to learn what you need to know in order to spot every market top.
Here’s what Apple CEO Steve Jobs had to say about effort: “The things I’ve
done in my life have required a lot of years of work before they took off.”
Annotated market topping charts for the period from the 1976 top to the
2007 top are shown a few pages ahead.
Historical Tops for Further Study
Historically, intermediate-term distribution tops (those that are usually fol-
lowed by 8% to 12% declines in the general market averages) occur as they
did during the first week of August 1954. First, there was increased New
York Stock Exchange volume without further upward price progress on the
Dow Jones Industrials. That was followed the next day by heavy volume
without further price progress up and with a wide price spread from high to
low on the Dow. Another such top occurred in the first week of July 1955. It
was characterized by a price climax with a wide price spread from the day’s
low to its high, followed the next day by increased volume with the Dow
closing down in price, and then, three days later, increased NYSE volume
with the Dow again closing down.

If you study the following daily market average graphs of several tops
closely and understand how they came about, you’ll come to recognize the
same indications as you observe future market environments. Each num-
bered day on these charts is a distribution day.
Follow the Leaders for Clues to a Market Top
The second most important indicator of a primary change in market direc-
tion, after the daily averages, is the way leading stocks act. After the market
has advanced for a couple of years, you can be fairly sure that it’s headed for
trouble if most of the individual stock leaders start acting abnormally.
One example of abnormal activity can be seen when leading stocks break
out of third- or fourth-stage chart base formations on the way up. Most of
these base structures will be faulty, with price fluctuations appearing much

wider and looser. A faulty base (wide, loose, and erratic) can best be recog-
nized and analyzed by studying charts of a stock’s daily or weekly price and
volume history.
Another sign of abnormal activity is the “climax” top. Here, a leading
stock will run up more rapidly for two or three weeks in a row, after having
advanced for many months. (See Chapter 11 on selling.)
A few leaders will have their first abnormal price break off the top on
heavy volume but then be unable to rally more than a small amount from
the lows of their correction. Still others will show a serious loss of upward
momentum in their most recent quarterly earnings reports.
Shifts in market direction can also be detected by reviewing the last four
or five stock purchases in your own portfolio. If you haven’t made a dime on
any of them, you could be picking up signs of a new downtrend.
Investors who use charts and understand market action know that very
few leading stocks will be attractive around market tops. There simply aren’t
any stocks coming out of sound, properly formed chart bases. The best mer-
chandise has been bought, played, and well picked over.
Most bases will be wide and loose—a big sign of real danger that you
must learn to understand and obey. All that’s left to show strength at this
stage are laggard stocks. The sight of sluggish or low-priced, lower-quality
laggards strengthening is a signal to the wise market operator the up market
may be near its end. Even turkeys can try to fly in a windstorm.
During the early phase of a bear market, certain leading stocks will seem
to be bucking the trend by holding up in price, creating the impression of
strength, but what you’re seeing is just a postponement of the inevitable.
When they raid the house, they usually get everyone, and eventually all the

A WINNING SYSTEM
leaders will succumb to the selling. This is exactly what happened in the 2000
bear market. Cisco and other high-tech leaders all eventually collapsed in
spite of the many analysts who incorrectly said that they should be bought.
That’s also what happened at the top of the Nasdaq in June and July of
2008. The steels, fertilizers, and oils that had led the 2003–2007 bull market
all rolled over and finally broke down after they appeared to be bucking the
overall market top that actually began with at least five distribution days in
October of 2007. U.S. Steel tanked even though its next two quarterly earn-
ings reports were up over 100%. Potash topped when its current quarter
was up 181% and its next quarter was up 220%. This fooled most analysts,
who were focused on the big earnings that had been reported or were
expected. They had not studied all past historical tops and didn’t realize that
many past leaders had topped when earnings were up 100%. Why did these
stocks finally cave in? They were in a bear market that had begun eight
months earlier, in late 2007.
Market tops, whether intermediate (usually 8% to 12% declines) or pri-
mary bull market peaks, sometimes occur five, six, or seven months after the
last major buy point in leading stocks and in the averages. Thus, top rever-
sals are usually late signals—the last straw before a cave-in. In most cases,
distribution, or selling, has been going on for days or even weeks in individ-
ual market leaders. Use of individual stock selling rules, which we’ll discuss
in Chapters 10 and 11, should already have led you to sell one or two of your
holdings on the way up, just before the market peak.
Other Bear Market Warnings
If the original market leaders begin to falter, and lower-priced, lower-qual-
ity, more-speculative stocks begin to move up, watch out! When the old
dogs begin to bark, the market is on its last feeble leg. Laggards can’t lead
the market higher. Among the telltale signs are the poor-quality stocks that
start to dominate the most-active list on market “up” days. This is simply a
matter of weak leadership trying to command the market. If the best ones
can’t lead, the worst certainly aren’t going to do so for very long.
Many top reversals (when the market closes at the bottom of its trading
range after making a new high that day) have occurred between the third
and the ninth day of a rally after the averages moved into new high ground
off small chart bases (meaning that the time span from the start to the end
of the pattern was really too short). It’s important to note that the conditions
under which the tops occurred were all about the same.
At other times, a topping market will recover for a couple of months and
get back nearly to its old high or even above it before breaking down in

earnest. This occurred in December 1976, January 1981, and January 1984.
There’s an important psychological reason for this: the majority of people in
the market can’t be exactly right at exactly the right time. In 1994, the Nas-
daq didn’t top until weeks after the Dow did. A similar thing happened in
early 2000.
The majority of people in the stock market, including both professional
and individual investors, will be fooled first. It’s all about human psychol-
ogy and emotions. If you were smart enough to sell or sell short in January
1981, the powerful rebound in February and March probably forced you to
cover your short sales at a loss or buy some stocks back during the strong
rally. It was an example of how treacherous the market really can be at
turning points.
Don’t Jump Back In Too Early
I didn’t have much problem recognizing and acting upon the early signs of
the many bear markets from 1962 through 2008. But a few times I made the
mistake of buying back too early. When you make a mistake in the stock
market, the only sound thing to do is to correct it. Don’t fight it. Pride and
ego never pay off; neither does vacillation when losses start to show up.
The typical bear market (and some aren’t typical) usually has three separate
phases, or legs, of decline interrupted by a couple of rallies that last just long
enough to convince investors to begin buying. In 1969 and 1974, a few of
these phony, drawn-out rallies lasted up to 15 weeks. Most don’t last that long.
Many institutional investors love to “bottom fish.” They’ll start buying
stocks off a supposed bottom and help make the rally convincing enough to
draw you in. You’re better off staying on the sidelines in cash until a new bull
market really starts.
How You Can Spot Stock Market Bottoms
Once you’ve recognized a bear market and have scaled back your stock
holdings, the big question is how long you should remain on the sidelines. If
you plunge back into the market too soon, the apparent rally may fade, and
you’ll lose money. But if you hesitate at the brink of the eventual roaring
recovery, opportunities will pass you by. Again, the daily general market
averages provide the best answer by far. Markets are always more reliable
than most investors’ emotions or personal opinions.
At some point in every correction—whether that correction is mild or
severe—the stock market will always attempt to rally. Don’t jump back in
right away. Wait for the market itself to confirm the new uptrend.

A WINNING SYSTEM
A rally attempt begins when a major market average closes higher after a
decline that happened either earlier in the day or during the previous ses-
sion. For example, the Dow plummets 3% in the morning but then recovers
later in the day and closes higher. Or the Dow closes down 2% and then
rebounds the next day. We typically call the session in which the Dow finally
closes higher the first day of the attempted rally, although there have been
some exceptions. For example, the first day of the early October market
bottom in 1998 was actually down on heavy volume, but it closed in the
upper half of that day’s price range. Sit tight and be patient. The first few
days of improvement can’t tell you whether the rally will succeed.
Starting on the fourth day of the attempted rally, look for one of the major
averages to “follow through” with a booming gain on heavier volume than
the day before. This tells you the rally is far more likely to be real. The most
powerful follow-throughs usually occur on the fourth to seventh days of the
rally. The 1998 bottom just mentioned followed through on the fifth day of
the attempted rally. The market was up 2.1%. A follow-through day should
give the feeling of an explosive rally that is strong, decisive, and conclu-
sive—not begrudging and on the fence or barely up 1½%. The market’s vol-
ume for the day should in most cases be above its average daily volume, in
addition to always being higher than the prior day’s trading.
Occasionally, but rarely, a follow-through occurs as early as the third
day of the rally. In such a case, the first, second, and third days must all be
very powerful, with a major average up 1½% to 2% or more each session in
heavy volume.
I used to consider 1% to be the percentage increase for a valid follow-
through day. However, in recent years, as institutional investors have
learned of our system, we’ve moved the requirement up a significant
amount for the Nasdaq and the Dow. By doing this, we are trying to mini-
mize the possibility that professionals will manipulate a few of the 30 stocks
in the Dow Jones average to create false or faulty follow-through days.
There will be cases in which confirmed rallies fail. A few large institutional
investors, armed with their immense buying power, can run up the averages
on a particular day and create the impression of a follow-through. Unless the
smart buyers are getting back on board, however, the rally will implode—
sometimes crashing on heavy volume within the next several days.
However, just because the market corrects the day after a follow-through
doesn’t mean the follow-through was false. When a bear market bottoms, it
frequently pulls back and settles above or near the lows made during the
previous few weeks. It is more constructive when these pullbacks or “tests”
hold at least a little above the absolute intraday lows made recently in the
market averages.

A follow-through signal doesn’t mean you should rush out and buy with
abandon. It just gives you the go-ahead to begin buying high-quality stocks
with strong sales and earnings as they break out of sound price bases, and it
is a vital second confirmation the attempted rally is succeeding.
Remember, no new bull market has ever started without a strong price
and volume follow-through confirmation. It pays to wait and listen to the
market. The following graphs are examples of several bottoms in the stock
market between 1974 and 2003.

The Big Money Is Made in the First Two Years
The really big money is usually made in the first one or two years of a nor-
mal new bull market cycle. It is at this point that you must always recognize,
and fully capitalize upon, the golden opportunities presented.
The rest of the “up” cycle usually consists of back-and-forth movement in
the market averages, followed by a bear market. The year 1965 was one of
the few exceptions, but that strong market in the third year of a new cycle
was caused by the beginning of the Vietnam War.
In the first or second year of a new bull market, there should be a few
intermediate-term declines in the market averages. These usually last a cou-
ple of months, with the market indexes dropping by from 8% to an occa-

sional 12% or 15%. After several sharp downward adjustments of this
nature, and after at least two years of a bull market have passed, heavy vol-
ume without further upside progress in the daily market averages could
indicate the early beginning of the next bear market.
Since the market is governed by supply and demand, you can interpret a
chart of the general market averages about the same way you read the chart
of an individual stock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500
are usually displayed in the better publications. Investor’s Business Daily
displays the Nasdaq Composite, the New York Stock Exchange Composite,
and the S&P 500, with large-size daily price and volume charts stacked one
on top of the other for ease of comparing the three. These charts should
show the high, low, and close of the market averages day by day for at least
six months, together with the daily NYSE and Nasdaq volume in millions of
shares traded.
Incidentally, when I began in the market about 50 years ago, an average
day on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.5 million shares. Today, 1.5 bil-
lion shares are traded on average each day—an incredible 150-fold increase
that clearly demonstrates beyond any question the amazing growth and suc-
cess of our free enterprise, capitalist system. Its unparalleled freedom and
opportunity have consistently attracted millions of ambitious people from
all around the world who have materially increased our productivity and
inventiveness. It has led to an unprecedented increase in our standard of liv-
ing, so that the vast majority of Americans and all areas of our population are
better off than they were before. There are always problems that need to be
recognized and solved. But our system is the most successful in the world,
and it offers remarkable opportunities to grow and advance to those who are
willing to work, train, and educate themselves. The 100 charts in Chapter 1
are only a small sample of big past investment opportunities.
Normal bear markets show three legs of price movement down, but
there’s no rule saying you can’t have four or even five down legs. You have to
evaluate overall conditions and events in the country objectively and let the
market averages tell their own story. And you have to understand what that
story is.
Additional Ways to Identify Key Market Turning Points
Look for Divergence of Key Averages
Several averages should be checked at market turning points to see if there
are significant divergences, meaning that they are moving in different direc-
tions (one up and one down) or that one index is advancing or declining at a
much greater rate than another.

M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It
For example, if the Dow is up 100 and the S&P 500 is up only the equiv-
alent of 20 on the Dow for the day (the S&P 500 being a broader index), it
would indicate the rally is not as broad and strong as it appears. To compare
the change in the S&P 500 to that in the Dow, divide the S&P 500 into the
Dow average and then multiply by the change in the S&P 500.
For example, if the Dow closed at 9,000 and the S&P 500 finished at 900,
the 9,000 Dow would be 10 times the S&P 500. Therefore, if the Dow, on a
particular day, is up 100 points and the S&P 500 is up 5 points, you can mul-
tiply the 5 by 10 and find that the S&P 500 was up only the equivalent of 50
points on the Dow.
The Dow’s new high in January 1984 was accompanied by a divergence in
the indexes: the broader-based, more significant S&P 500 did not hit a new
high. This is the reason most professionals plot the key indexes together—to
make it easier to spot nonconfirmations at key turning points. Institutional
investors periodically run up the 30-stock Dow while they liquidate the
broader Nasdaq or a list of technology stocks under cover of the Dow run-up.
It’s like a big poker game, with players hiding their hands, bluffing, and faking.
Certain Psychological Market Indicators Might at Times Help
Now that trading in put and call options is the get-rich-quick scheme for
many speculators, you can plot and analyze the ratio of calls to puts for
another valuable insight into crowd temperament. Options traders buy calls,
which are options to buy common stock, or puts, which are options to sell
common stock. A call buyer hopes prices will rise; a buyer of put options
wishes prices to fall.
If the volume of call options in a given period of time is greater than the
volume of put options, a logical assumption is that option speculators as a
group are expecting higher prices and are bullish on the market. If the vol-
ume of put options is greater than that of calls, speculators hold a bearish
attitude. When option players buy more puts than calls, the put-to-call ratio
index rises a little above 1.0. Such a reading coincided with general market
bottoms in 1990, 1996, 1998, and April and September 2001, but you can’t
always expect this to occur.
The percentage of investment advisors who are bearish is an interesting
measure of investor sentiment. When bear markets are near the bottom, the
great majority of advisory letters will usually be bearish. Near market tops,
most will be bullish. The majority is usually wrong when it’s most important
to be right. However, you cannot blindly assume that because 65% of invest-
ment advisors were bearish the last time the general market hit bottom, a
major market decline will be over the next time the investment advisors’
index reaches the same point.

A WINNING SYSTEM
The short-interest ratio is the amount of short selling on the New York
Stock Exchange, expressed as a percentage of total NYSE volume. This ratio
can reflect the degree of bearishness shown by speculators in the market.
Along bear market bottoms, you will usually see two or three major peaks
showing sharply increased short selling. There’s no rule governing how high
the index should go, but studying past market bottoms can give you an idea
of what the ratio looked like at key market junctures.
An index that is sometimes used to measure the degree of speculative
activity is the Nasdaq volume as a percentage of NYSE volume. This mea-
sure provided a helpful tip-off of impending trouble during the summer of
1983, when Nasdaq volume increased significantly relative to the Big
Board’s (NYSE). When a trend persists and accelerates, indicating wild,
rampant speculation, you’re close to a general market correction. The vol-
ume of Nasdaq trading has grown larger than that on the NYSE in recent
years because so many new entrepreneurial companies are listed on the
Nasdaq, so this index must be viewed differently now.
Interpret the Overrated Advance-Decline Line
Some technical analysts religiously follow advance-decline (A-D) data. These
technicians take the number of stocks advancing each day versus the number
that are declining, and then plot that ratio on a graph. Advance-decline lines
are far from precise because they frequently veer sharply lower long before a
bull market finally tops. In other words, the market keeps advancing toward
higher ground, but it is being led by fewer but better stocks.
The advance-decline line is simply not as accurate as the key general mar-
ket indexes because analyzing the market’s direction is not a simple total
numbers game. Not all stocks are created equal; it’s better to know where
the real leadership is and how it’s acting than to know how many more
mediocre stocks are advancing and declining.
The NYSE A-D line peaked in April 1998 and trended lower during the
new bull market that broke out six months later in October. The A-D line
continued to fall from October 1999 to March 2000, missing one of the mar-
ket’s most powerful rallies in decades.
An advance-decline line can sometimes be helpful when a clear-cut bear
market attempts a short-term rally. If the A-D line lags the market averages
and can’t rally, it’s giving an internal indication that, despite the strength of
the rally in the Dow or S&P, the broader market remains frail. In such
instances, the rally usually fizzles. In other words, it takes more than just a
few leaders to make a new bull market.
At best, the advance-decline line is a secondary indicator of limited
value. If you hear commentators or TV market strategists extolling its

virtues bullishly or bearishly, they probably haven’t done their homework.
No secondary measurements can be as accurate as the major market
indexes, so you don’t want to get confused and overemphasize the vast
array of other technical measures that most people use, usually with lack-
luster results.
Watch Federal Reserve Board Rate Changes
Among fundamental general market indicators, changes in the Federal
Reserve Board’s discount rate (the interest rate the FRB charges member
banks for loans), the fed funds rate (the interest rate banks with fund
reserves charge for loans to banks without fund reserves), and occasionally
stock margin levels are valuable indicators to watch.
As a rule, interest rates provide the best confirmation of basic economic
conditions, and changes in the discount rate and the fed funds rate are by far
the most reliable. In the past, three successive significant hikes in Fed inter-
est rates have generally marked the beginning of bear markets and impend-
ing recessions.
Bear markets have usually, but not always, ended when the rate was
finally lowered. On the downside, the discount rate increase to 6% in Sep-
tember 1987, just after Alan Greenspan became chairman, led to the severe
market break that October.
Money market indicators mirror general economic activity. At times I
have followed selected government and Federal Reserve Board measure-
ments, including 10 indicators of the supply and demand for money and
indicators of interest-rate levels. History proves that the direction of the
general market, and also that of several industry groups, is often affected by
changes in interest rates because the level of interest rates is usually tied to
tight or easy Fed monetary policy.
For the investor, the simplest and most relevant monetary indicators to fol-
low and understand are the changes in the discount rate and fed funds rate.
With the advent of program trading and various hedging devices, some
funds now hedge portions of their portfolio in an attempt to provide some
downside protection during risky markets. The degree to which these
hedges are successful again depends greatly on skill and timing, but one
possible effect for some managers may be to lessen the pressure to dump
portfolio securities on the market.
Most funds operate with a policy of being widely diversified and fully or
nearly fully invested at all times. This is because most fund managers, given
the great size of today’s funds (billions of dollars), have difficulty getting out
of the market and into cash at the right time and, most importantly, then
getting back into the market fast enough to participate in the initial power-

ful rebound off the ultimate bottom. So they may try to shift their emphasis
to big-cap, semidefensive groups.
The Fed Crushes the 1981 Economy. The bear market and the costly, protracted
recession that began in 1981, for example, came about solely because the
Fed increased the discount rate in rapid succession on September 26,
November 17, and December 5 of 1980. Its fourth increase, on May 8, 1981,
thrust the discount rate to an all-time high of 14%. That finished off the U.S.
economy, our basic industries, and the stock market for the time being.
Fed rate changes, however, should not be your primary market indicator
because the stock market itself is always your best barometer. Our analysis
of market cycles turned up three key market turns that the discount rate did
not help predict.
Independent Fed actions are typically very constructive, as the Fed tries
to counteract overheated excesses or sharp contractions in our economy.
However, its actions and results clearly demonstrate how much our overall
federal government, not our stock markets reacting to all events, can and
does at times significantly influence our economic future, for good or bad.
In fact, the subprime real estate mortgage meltdown and the financial
credit crisis that led to the highly unusual market collapse of 2008 can be eas-
ily traced to moves in 1995 by the then-current administration to substantially
beef up the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977. These actions
required banks to make more higher-risk loans in lower-income areas than
they would otherwise have made. Failure to comply meant stiff penalties, law-
suits, and limits on getting approvals for mergers and branch expansion.
Our government, in effect, encouraged and coerced major banks to lower
their long-proven safe-lending standards. Most of the more than $1 trillion
of new subprime CRA loans had adjustable rates. Many such loans eventu-
ally came to require no documentation of the borrower’s income and in
some cases little or no down payment.
In addition, for the first time, new regulatory rules not only allowed but
encouraged lenders to bundle the new, riskier subprime loans with prime
loans and sell these assumed government-sponsored loan packages to other
institutions and countries that thought they were buying safe AAA bonds.
The first of these bundled loans hit the investment market in 1997. That
action allowed loan originators and big banks to make profits faster and
eliminate future risk and responsibility for many of those lower-quality
loans. It let the banks turn around and make even more CRA-type loans,
then sell them off in packages again, with little future risk or responsibility.
In time, the unintended result was a gigantic government-sponsored
pyramiding mechanism, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac providing the

A WINNING SYSTEM
implied government backing by buying vast quantities of the more risky
subprimes; this led to their facing bankruptcy and needing enormous gov-
ernment bailouts. Freddie and Fannie’s management had also received
huge bonuses and were donors to certain members of Congress, who
repeatedly defended the highly leveraged, extremely risky lending against
any sound reforms.
Bottom line: this was a Big Government program that was started with
absolutely good, worthy social intentions, but with little insight and
absolutely zero foresight that over time resulted in severe damage and enor-
mous unintended consequences that affected almost everything and every-
one, including, sadly, the very lower-income people that this rather inept
government operation was supposed to be helping. It put our whole financial
system in jeopardy. Big Wall Street firms got involved after the rescinding of
the Glass-Steagall Act in 1998, and both political parties, Congress, and the
public all played key parts in creating the great financial fiasco.
The 1962 Stock Market Break. Another notable stock market break occurred in 1962.
In the spring, nothing was wrong with the economy, but the market got
skittish after the government announced an investigation of the stock
market and then got on the steel companies for raising prices. IBM dropped
50%. That fall, after the Cuban missile showdown with the Russians, a new
bull market sprang to life. All of this happened with no change in the
discount rate.
There have also been situations in which the discount rate was lowered
six months after the market bottom was reached. In such cases, you would
be late getting into the game if you waited for the discount rate to drop. In
a few instances, after Fed rate cuts occurred, the markets continued lower
or whipsawed for several months. This also occurred dramatically in 2000
and 2001.
The Hourly Market Index and Volume Changes
At key turning points, an active market operator can watch the market
indexes and volume changes hour by hour and compare them to volume in
the same hour of the day before.
A good time to watch hourly volume figures is during the first attempted
rally following the initial decline off the market peak. You should be able to
see if volume is dull or dries up on the rally. You can also see if the rally starts
to fade late in the day, with volume picking up as it does, a sign that the rally
is weak and will probably fail.
Hourly volume data also come in handy when the market averages reach
an important prior low point and start breaking that “support” area. (A sup-

port area is a previous price level below which investors hope that an index
will not fall.) What you want to know is whether selling picks up dramati-
cally or by just a small amount as the market collapses into new low ground.
If selling picks up dramatically, it represents significant downward pressure
on the market.
After the market has undercut previous lows for a few days, but on only
slightly higher volume, look for either a volume dry-up day or one or two
days of increased volume without the general market index going lower. If
you see this, you may be in a “shakeout” area (when the market pressures
many traders to sell, often at a loss), ready for an upturn after scaring out
weak holders.
Overbought and Oversold: Two Risky Words
The short-term overbought/oversold indicator has an avid following among
some individual technicians and investors. It’s a 10-day moving average of
advances and declines in the market. But be careful. At the start of a new
bull market, the overbought/oversold index can become substantially “over-
bought.” This should notbe taken as a sign to sell stocks.
A big problem with indexes that move counter to the trend is that you
always have the question of how bad things can get before everything finally
turns. Many amateurs follow and believe in overbought/oversold indicators.
Something similar can happen in the early stage or first leg of a major
bear market, when the index can become unusually oversold. This is really
telling you that a bear market may be imminent. The market was “oversold”
all the way down during the brutal market implosion of 2000.
I once hired a well-respected professional who relied on such technical
indicators. During the 1969 market break, at the very point when everything
told me the market was getting into serious trouble, and I was aggressively
trying to get several portfolio managers to liquidate stocks and raise large
amounts of cash, he was telling them that it was too late to sell because his
overbought/oversold indicator said that the market was already very over-
sold. You guessed it: the market then split wide open.
Needless to say, I rarely pay attention to overbought/oversold indicators.
What you learn from years of experience is usually more important than the
opinions and theories of experts using their many different favorite indicators.
Other General Market Indicators
Upside/downside volumeis a short-term index that relates trading volume in
stocks that close up in price for the day to trading volume in stocks that close
down. This index, plotted as a 10-week moving average, may show diver-
gence at some intermediate turning points in the market. For example, after



==================================================

==================================================

232
A WINNING SYSTEM
a 10% to 12% dip, the general market averages may continue to penetrate
into new low ground for a week or two. Yet the upside/downside volume
may suddenly shift and show steadily increasing upside volume, with down-
side volume easing. This switch usually signals an intermediate-term upturn
in the market. But you’ll pick up the same signals if you watch the changes
in the daily Dow, Nasdaq, or S&P 500 and the market volume.
Some services measure the percentage of new money flowing into corpo-
rate pension funds that is invested in common stocks and the percentage
that is invested in cash equivalents or bonds. This opens another window
into institutional investor psychology. However, majority—or crowd—
thinking is seldom right, even when it’s done by professionals. Every year or
two, Wall Street seems to be of one mind, with everyone following each
other like a herd of cattle. Either they all pile in or they all pile out.
An index of “defensive” stocks—more stable and supposedly safer issues,
such as utilities, tobaccos, foods, and soaps—may often show strength after a
couple of years of bull market conditions. This may indicate the “smart
money” is slipping into defensive positions and that a weaker general market
lies ahead. But this doesn’t always work. None of these secondary market
indicators is anywhere near as reliable as the key general market indexes.
Another indicator that is helpful at times in evaluating the stage of a
market cycle is the percentage of stocks in defensive or laggard categories
that are making new price highs. In pre-1983 cycles, some technicians
rationalized their lack of concern with market weakness by citing the num-
ber of stocks that were still making new highs. But analysis of new-high
lists shows that a large percentage of preferred or defensive stocks signals
bear market conditions. Superficial knowledge can hurt you in the stock
market.
To summarize this complex but vitally important chapter: learn to inter-
pret the daily price and volume changes of the general market indexes and
the action of individual market leaders. Once you know how to do this cor-
rectly, you can stop listening to all the costly, uninformed, personal market
opinions of amateurs and professionals alike. As you can see, the key to stay-
ing on top of the stock market is not predicting or knowing what the market is
going to do. It’s knowing and understanding what the market has actually done
in the past several weeks and what it is currently doing now.We don’t want to
give personal opinions or predictions; we carefully observe market supply
and demand as it changes day by day.
One of the great values of this system of interpreting the price and vol-
ume changes in the market averages is not just the ability to better recog-
nize market top and bottom areas, but also the ability to track each rally
attempt when the market is on its way down. In most instances, waiting for

powerful follow-through days keeps you from being drawn prematurely into
rally attempts that ultimately end in failure. In other words, you have rules
that will continue to keep you from getting sucked into phony rallies. This is
how we were able to stay out of the market and in money market funds for
most of 2000 through 2002, preserve the majority of the gains we had made
in 1998 and 1999, and help those who read and followed our many basic
rules. There is a fortune for you in this paragraph.
Part I Review: How to Remember and
Use What You’ve Read So Far
It isn’t enough just to read. You need to remember and apply all of what
you’ve read. The CAN SLIM system will help you remember what you’ve
read so far. Each letter in the CAN SLIM systemstands for one of the seven
basic fundamentals of selecting outstanding stocks. Most successful stocks
have these seven common characteristics at emerging growth stages, so they
are worth committing to memory. Repeat this formula until you can recall
and use it easily:
C = Current Quarterly Earnings per Share. Quarterly earnings per
share must be up at least 18% or 20%, but preferably up 40% to 100% or
200% or more—the higher, the better. They should also be accelerating
at some point in recent quarters. Quarterly sales should also be acceler-
ating or up 25%.
A = Annual Earnings Increases. There must be significant (25% or
more) growth in each of the last three years and a return on equity of 17%
or more (with 25% to 50% preferred). If return on equity is too low, pre-
tax profit margin must be strong.
N = New Products, New Management, New Highs.Look for new prod-
ucts or services, new management, or significant new changes in industry
conditions. And most important, buy stocks as they emerge from sound,
properly formed chart bases and begin to make new highs in price.
S = Supply and Demand—Shares Outstanding plus Big Volume
Demand.Any size capitalization is acceptable in today’s new economy as
long as a company fits all the other CAN SLIM rules. Look for big vol-
ume increases when a stock begins to move out of its basing area.
L = Leader or Laggard.Buy market leaders and avoid laggards. Buy the
number one company in its field or space. Most leaders will have Relative
Price Strength Ratings of 80 to 90 or higher and composite ratings of 90
or more in bull markets.

A WINNING SYSTEM
I = Institutional Sponsorship. Buy stocks with increasing sponsorship
and at least one or two mutual fund owners with top-notch recent per-
formance records. Also look for companies with management ownership.
M = Market Direction. Learn to determine the overall market direction
by accurately interpreting the daily market indexes’ price and volume
movements and the action of individual market leaders. This can deter-
mine whether you win big or lose. You need to stay in gear with the mar-
ket. It doesn’t pay to be out of phase with the market.
Is CAN SLIM Momentum Investing?
I’m not even sure what “momentum investing” is. Some analysts and
reporters who don’t understand anything about how we invest have given
that name to what we talk about and do. They say it’s “buying the stocks that
have gone up the most in price” and that have the strongest relative price
strength. No one in her right mind invests that way. What we do is identify
companies with strong fundamentals—large sales and earnings increases
resulting from unique new products or services—and then buy their stocks
when they emerge from properly formed price consolidation periods and
before they run up dramatically in price during bull markets.
When bear markets are beginning, we want people to protect themselves
and nail down their gains by knowing when to sell and start raising cash. We
are not investment advisors. We do not write and disseminate any research
reports. We do not call or visit companies. We do not make markets in
stocks, deal in derivatives, do underwritings, or arrange mergers. We don’t
manage any public or institutional money.
We are historians, studying and discovering how stocks and markets actu-
ally work and teaching and training people everywhere who want to make
money investing intelligently and realistically. These are ordinary people
from all walks of life, including professionals. We do not give them fish. We
teach them how to fish for their whole future so that they too can capitalize
on the American Dream.
Experts, Education, and Egos
On Wall Street, wise men can be drawn into booby traps just as easily as fools.
From what I’ve seen over many years, the length and quality of one’s education
and the level of one’s IQ have very little to do with making money investing in
the market. The more intelligent people are—particularly men—the more
they think they really know what they’re doing, and the more they may have to
learn the hard way how little they really know about outsmarting the markets.

M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It
We’ve all now witnessed firsthand the severe damage that supposedly
bright, intelligent, and highly educated people in New York and Washing-
ton, D.C., caused this country in 2008. U.S. senators, heads of congressional
committees, political types working for government-sponsored entities such
as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, plus heads of top New York-based bro-
kerage firms, lending banks, and mortgage brokers all thought they knew
what they were doing, with many of them using absurd leverage of 50 to 1
to invest in subprime real estate loans.
They created sophisticated derivatives and insurance programs to justify
such incredible risks. No one group was solely to blame, since both Democ-
rats and Republicans were involved. However, it all began as a well-
intended Big Government program that was accelerated in 1995, 1997, and
1998, when the Glass-Steagall Act was rescinded, and things continued to
escalate out of control.
So maybe it’s time for you to take more control of your investing and
make up your mind that you’re going to learn how to save and invest your
hard-earned money more safely and wisely than Washington and Wall
Street have done since the late 1990s. If you really want to do it, you cer-
tainly can. Anyone can.
The few people I’ve known over the years who’ve been unquestionably
successful investing in America were decisive individuals without huge
egos. The market has a simple way of whittling all excessive pride and
overblown egos down to size. After all, the whole idea is to be completely
objective and recognize what the marketplace is telling you, rather than try-
ing to prove that what you said or did yesterday or six weeks ago was right.
The fastest way to take a bath in the stock market is to try to prove that you
are right and the market is wrong. Humility and common sense provide
essential balance.
Sometimes, listening to quoted and accepted experts can get you into
trouble. In the spring and summer of 1982, a well-known expert insisted
that government borrowing was going to crowd out the private sector and
that interest rates and inflation would soar back to new highs. Things turned
out exactly the opposite: inflation broke and interest rates came crashing
down. Another expert’s bear market call in the summer of 1996 came only
one day before the market bottom.
Week after week during the 2000 bear market, one expert after another
kept saying on CNBC that it was time to buy high-tech stocks—only to
watch the techs continue to plummet further. Many high-profile analysts
and strategists kept telling investors to capitalize on these once-in-a-lifetime
“buying opportunities” on the way down! Buying on the way down can be a
very dangerous pastime.

A WINNING SYSTEM
Conventional wisdom or consensus thinking in the market is seldom
right. I never pay any attention to the parade of experts voicing their per-
sonal opinions on the market in print or on TV. It creates entirely too much
confusion and can cost you a great deal of money. In 2000, some strategists
were telling people to buy the dips (short-term declines in price) because
the cash position of mutual funds had increased greatly and all this money
was sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested. To prove this wrong, all
anyone had to do was look at the General Markets & Sectors page in
Investor’s Business Daily. It showed that while mutual fund cash positions
had indeed risen, they were still significantly below their historical highs
and even below their historical averages.
The only thing that works well is to let the market indexes tell you when
it’s time to enter and exit. Never fight the market—it’s bigger than you are.

When You Must Sell and Cut
Every Loss . . . Without Exception
Now that you’ve learned how and when to buy nothing but the best stocks, it’s
time for you to learn how and when to sell them. You’ve probably heard the
sports cliché: “The best offense is a strong defense.” The funny thing about
clichés is they are usually true: a team that’s all offense and no defense sel-
dom wins the game. In fact, a strong defense can often propel a team to
great heights.
During their heyday, when Branch Rickey was president and general
manager, the Brooklyn Dodgers typically had good pitching. In the game of
baseball, the combination of pitching and fielding represents the defensive
side of a team and probably 70% of the game. It’s almost impossible to win
without them.
The same holds true in the stock market. Unless you have a strong
defense to protect yourself against large losses, you absolutely can’t win big
in the game of investing.
Bernard Baruch’s Secret Market Method of Making Millions
Bernard Baruch, a famous market operator on Wall Street and a trusted
advisor to U.S. presidents, said it best: “If a speculator is correct half of the
time, he is hitting a good average. Even being right 3 or 4 times out of 10
should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly
on the ventures where he has been wrong.”
As you can see, even the most successful investors make many mistakes.
These poor decisions will lead to losses, some of which can become quite

BE SMART FROM THE START
awful if you’re not disciplined and careful. No matter how smart you are,
how high your IQ, how advanced your education, how good your informa-
tion, or how sound your analysis, you’re simply not going to be right all the
time. In fact, you’ll probably be right less than half the time! You positively
must understand and accept that the first rule for the highly successful indi-
vidual investor is . . . always cut short and limit every single loss. To do this
takes never-ending discipline and courage.
Marc Mandell of Winning on Wall Street has been reading Investor’s
Business Dailysince 1987. He likes it for its many moneymaking ideas and
its emphasis on risk-management strategies. “Lose small and win big,” he
believes, “is the holy grail of investing.”
Baruch’s point about cutting losses was driven home to me by an account
that I managed back in 1962. The general market had taken a 29% nose-
dive, and we were right on only one of every three commitments we had
made in this account. Yet at the end of the year, the account was ahead. The
reason was that the average profit on the 33% of decisions that were cor-
rect was more than twice the average of the small losses we took when we
were off-target.
I like to follow a 3-to-1 ratio between where to sell and take profits and
where to cut losses. If you take some 20% to 25% gains, cut your losses at
7% or 8%. If you’re in a bear market like 2008 and you buy any stocks at all,
you might get only a few 10% or 15% gains, so I’d move quickly to cut every
single loss automatically at 3%, with no exceptions.
The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all
the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you’re wrong.
You’ve got to recognize when you may be wrong and sell without hesita-
tion to cut short every one of your losses. It’s your job to get in phase with
the market and not try to get the market to be in phase with you.
How can you tell when you may be wrong? That’s easy: the price of the
stock drops below the price you paid for it! Each point that your favorite
brainchild falls below your cost increases both the chance that you’re wrong
and the price that you’re going to pay for being wrong.
Are Successful People Lucky or Always Right?
People think that in order to be successful, you have to be either lucky or
right most of the time. Not so. Successful people make many mistakes, and
their success is due to hard work, not luck. They just try harder and more
often than the average person. There aren’t many overnight successes; suc-
cess takes time.

When You Must Sell and Cut Every Loss . . . Without Exception
In search of a filament for his electric lamp, Thomas Edison carbonized and
tested 6,000 specimens of bamboo. Three of them worked. Before that, he had
tried thousands of other materials, from cotton thread to chicken feathers.
Babe Ruth worked so hard for his home run record that he also held the
lifetime record for strikeouts. Irving Berlin wrote more than 600 songs, but no
more than 50 were hits. The Beatles were turned down by every record com-
pany in England before they made it big. Michael Jordan was once cut from
his high school basketball team, and Albert Einstein made an F in math. (It
also took him many years to develop and prove his theory of relativity.)
It takes a lot of trial and error before you can nail down substantial gains in
stocks like Brunswick and Great Western Financial when they doubled in
1961, Chrysler and Syntex in 1963, Fairchild Camera and Polaroid in 1965,
Control Data in 1967, Levitz Furniture in 1970–1972, Prime Computer and
Humana in 1977–1981, MCI Communications in 1981–1982, Price Company
in 1982–1983, Microsoft in 1986–1992, Amgen in 1990–1991, International
Game Technology in 1991–1993, Cisco Systems from 1995 to 2000, America
Online and Charles Schwab in 1998–1999, and Qualcomm in 1999. These
stocks dazzled the market with gains ranging from 100% to more than 1,000%.
Over the years, I’ve found that only one or two out of ten stocks that I’ve
bought turned out to be truly outstanding and capable of making this kind
of substantial profits. In other words, to get the one or two stocks that make
big money, you have to look for and buy ten.
Which begs the question, what do you do with the other eight? Do you sit
with them and hope, the way most people do? Or do you sell them and keep
trying until you come up with even bigger successes?
When Does a Loss Become a Loss?
When you say, “I can’t sell my stock because I don’t want to take a loss,” you
assume that what you want has some bearing on the situation. But the stock
doesn’t know who you are, and it couldn’t care less what you hope or want.
Besides, selling doesn’t give you the loss; you already have the loss. If you
think you haven’t incurred a loss until you sell the stock, you’re kidding
yourself. The larger the paper loss, the more real it will become. If you paid
$40 per share for 100 shares of Can’t Miss Chemical, and it’s now worth $28
per share, you have $2,800 worth of stock that cost you $4,000. You have a
$1,200 loss. Whether you convert the stock to cash or hold it, it’s still worth
only $2,800.
Even though you didn’t sell, you took your loss when the stock dropped
in price. You’d be better off selling and going back to a cash position where
you can think far more objectively.

BE SMART FROM THE START
When you’re holding on to a big loss, you’re rarely able to think straight.
You get emotional. You rationalize and say, “It can’t go any lower.” However,
keep in mind that there are many other stocks to choose from where your
chance of recouping your loss could be greater.
Here’s another suggestion that may help you decide whether to sell: pre-
tend that you don’t own the stock and you have $2,800 in the bank. Then ask
yourself, “Do I really want to buy this stock now?” If your answer is no, then
why are you holding onto it?
Always, without Exception, Limit Losses
to 7% or 8% of Your Cost
Individual investors should definitely set firm rules limiting the loss on the
initial capital they have invested in each stock to an absolute maximum of
7% or 8%. Institutional investors who lessen their overall risk by taking large
positions and diversifying broadly are unable to move into and out of stocks
quickly enough to follow such a loss-cutting plan. This is a terrific advantage
that you, the nimble and decisive individual investor, have over the institu-
tions. So use it.
When the late Gerald M. Loeb of E. F. Hutton was writing his last book
on the stock market, he came down to visit me, and I had the pleasure of dis-
cussing this idea with him. In his first work, The Battle for Investment Sur-
vival, Loeb advocated cutting all losses at 10%. I was curious and asked him
if he always followed the 10% loss policy himself. “I would hope,” he
replied, “to be out long before they ever reach 10%.” Loeb made millions in
the market.
Bill Astrop, president of Astrop Advisory Corp. in Atlanta, Georgia, sug-
gests a minor revision of the 10% loss-cutting plan. He thinks that individ-
ual investors should sell half of their position in a stock if it is down 5% from
their cost and the other half once it’s down 10%. This is sound advice.
To preserve your hard-earned money, I think a 7% or 8% loss should be
the limit. The average of all your losses should be less, perhaps 5% or 6%, if
you’re strictly disciplined and fast on your feet. If you can keep the average
of all your mistakes and losses to 5% or 6%, you’ll be like the football team
on which opponents can never move the ball. If you don’t give up many first
downs, how can anyone ever beat you?
Now here’s a valuable secret: if you use charts to time your buys precisely
offsoundbases (price consolidation areas), your stocks will rarely drop 8%
from a correct buy point. So when they do, either you’ve made a mistake in
your selection or a general market decline may be starting. This is a big key
to your future success.

When You Must Sell and Cut Every Loss . . . Without Exception
Barbara James, an IBD subscriber who has attended several of our work-
shops, didn’t know anything about stocks when she started investing after 20
years in the real estate business. She first traded on paper using the IBD
rules. This worked so well that she finally had the confidence to try it with
real money. That was in the late 1990s, when the market seemed to have
only one direction—up. The first stock she bought using the IBD rules was
EMC. When she sold it in 2000, she had a 1,300% gain. She also had a gain
of over 200% in Gap. Ten years after her start, with the profits she made
using IBD, she was able to pay off her house and her car.
And thanks to the 7% rule, Barbara can take advantage of the market
once it improves. Before the market started to correct in the fall of 2007, she
had bought three CAN SLIM stocks—Monolithic Power, China Medical,
and St. Jude Medical. “I bought them all at exactly the right pivot point, and
I got forced out of all three as the market started to correct in July and
August,” she says. “I am happy to lose money when it’s only 7% or 8%. If it
hadn’t been for the sell rules, I would have lost my shirt. And I wouldn’t
have resources for the next bull market.”
Here’s what another IBD subscriber, Herb Mitchell, told us in February
2009: “Over and over again, the buy and sell rules—especially the sell
rules—have been proven to work. It took me a couple of years to finally get
it through my head, but then the results started to show. I spent most of
2008 on the sidelines, and I now get compliments from friends who say that
they lost thousands—50% or more—in their IRA accounts while I had a 5%
gain for the year. I think I should have done better, but you live and learn.”
Also, there’s no rule that says you have to wait until every single loss
reaches 7% to 8% before you take it. On occasion, you’ll sense the general
market index is under distribution (selling) or your stock isn’t acting right
and you are starting off amiss. In such cases, you can cut your loss sooner,
when the stock may be down only one or two points.
Before the market broke wide open in October 1987, for example, there
was ample time to sell and cut losses short. That correction actually began
on August 26. If you’re foolish enough to try bucking the market by buying
stocks in bearish conditions, at least move your absolute loss-cutting point
up to 3% or 4%.
After years of experience with this technique, your average losses should
become less as your stock selection and timing improve and you learn to
make small “follow-up buys” in your best stocks. It takes a lot of time to
learn to make follow-up buys safely when a stock is up, but this method of
money management forces you to move your money from slower-perform-
ing stocks into your stronger ones. I call this force-feeding. (See “My
Revised Profit-and-Loss Plan” in Chapter 11.) You’ll end up selling stocks

BE SMART FROM THE START
that are not yet down 7% or 8% because you are raising money to add to
your best winners during clearly strong bull markets.
Remember: 7% to 8% is your absolute loss limit.You must sell without hes-
itation—no waiting a few days to see what might happen; no hoping that the
stock will rally back; no need to wait for the day’s market close. Nothing but
the fact that you’re down 7% or 8% below your cost should have a bearing
on the situation at this point.
Once you’re significantly ahead and have a good profit, you can afford to
give the stock a good bit more room for normal fluctuations off its price
peak. Do notsell a stock just because it’s off 7% to 8% from its peak price.
It’s important that you definitely understand the difference.
In one case, you probably started off wrong. The stock is not acting the
way you expected it to, and it is down below your purchase price. You’re
starting to lose your hard-earned money, and you may be about to lose a lot
more. In the other case, you have begun correctly. The stock has acted bet-
ter, and you have a significant gain. Now you’re working on a profit, so in a
bull market, you can afford to give the stock more room to fluctuate so that
you don’t get shaken out on a normal 10% to 15% correction.
Don’t chase your stock up too far when you’re buying it, however. The
key is timing your stock purchases exactly at breakout points to minimize
the chance that a stock will drop 8%. (See Chapter 2 for more on using
charts to select stocks.)
All Common Stocks Are Speculative and Risky
There is considerable risk in all common stocks, regardless of their name,
quality, purported blue-chip status, previous performance record, or cur-
rent good earnings. Keep in mind that growth stocks can top at a time when
their earnings are excellent and analysts’ estimates are still rosy.
There are no sure things or safe stocks. Any stock can go down at any time
. . . and you never know how far it can go down.
Every 50% loss began as a 10% or 20% loss. Having the raw courage to
sell and take your loss cheerfully is the only way you can protect yourself
against the possibility of much greater losses. Decision and action should be
instantaneous and simultaneous. To be a big winner, you have to learn to
make decisions. I’ve known at least a dozen educated and otherwise intelli-
gent people who were completely wiped out solely because they would not
sell and cut a loss.
What should you do if a stock gets away from you and the loss becomes
greater than 10%? This can happen to anyone, and it’s an even more critical
sign that the stock positively must be sold. The stock was in more trouble

When You Must Sell and Cut Every Loss . . . Without Exception
than normal, so it fell faster and further than normal. In the market collapse
of 2000, many new investors lost heavily, and some of them lost it all. If they
had just followed the simple sell rule discussed earlier, they would have pro-
tected most of their capital.
In my experience, the stocks that get away from you and produce larger-
than-normal losses are the truly awful selections that absolutely must be sold.
Something is really going wrong with either the stock or the whole market,
and it’s even more urgent that the stock be sold to avoid a later catastrophe.
Keep in mind that if you let a stock drop 50%, you must make 100% on
your next stock just to break even! And how often do you buy stocks that
double? You simply can’t afford to sit with a stock where the loss keeps get-
ting worse.
It is a dangerous fallacy to assume that because a stock goes down, it has
to come back up. Many don’t. Others take years to recover. AT&T hit a high
of $75 in 1964 and took 20 years to come back. Also, when the S&P 500 or
Dow declines 20% to 25% in a bear market, many stocks will plummet 60%
to 75%.
If the S&P dives 52%, as it did in 2008, some stocks can fall 80% to 90%.
Who would have projected that General Motors would sell for $2 a share,
down from $94? The auto industry is important to the United States, but it
will require a serious, top-to-bottom restructuring and will possibly have to
go through bankruptcy if it is to survive and compete effectively in the
highly competitive world market. For 14 years, from 1994 to 2008, GM
stock’s relative price strength line declined steadily. What will GM do in the
future if India or China sells cars in the United States that get 50 miles per
gallon and have a much lower price?
The only way to prevent bad stock market losses is to cut them without
hesitation while they’re still small. Always protect your account so that you
can live to invest successfully another day.
In 2000, many new investors incorrectly believed that all you had to do
was buy high-tech stocks on every dip in price because they would always go
back up and there was easy money to be made. This is an amateur’s strategy,
and it almost always leads to heavy losses. Semiconductor and other tech-
nology stocks are two to three times as volatile and risky as others. So if
you’re in these stocks, moving rapidly to cut short every loss is even more
essential. If your portfolio is in nothing but high-tech stocks, or if you’re
heavily margined in tech stocks, you are asking for serious trouble if you
don’t cut your losses quickly.
You should never invest on margin unless you’re willing to cut all your
losses quickly. Otherwise, you could go belly-up in no time. If you get a mar-
gin call from your broker (when you’re faced with the decision to either sell

BE SMART FROM THE START
stock or add money to your account to cover the lost equity in a falling
stock), don’t throw good money after bad. Sell some stock, and recognize
what the market and your margin clerk are trying to tell you.
Cutting Losses Is Like Buying an Insurance Policy
This policy of limiting losses is similar to paying insurance premiums. You’re
reducing your risk to precisely the level you’re comfortable with. Yes, the
stock you sell will often turn right around and go back up. And yes, this can
be frustrating. But when this happens, don’t conclude that you were wrong
to sell it. That is exceedingly dangerous thinking that will eventually get you
into big trouble.
Think about it this way: If you bought insurance on your car last year and
you didn’t have an accident, was your money wasted? Will you buy the same
insurance this year? Of course you will! Did you take out fire insurance on
your home or your business? If your home or business hasn’t burned down,
are you upset because you feel that you made a bad financial decision? No.
You don’t buy fire insurance because you know your house is going to burn
down. You buy insurance just in case, to protect yourself against the remote
possibility of a serious loss.
It’s exactly the same for the winning investor who cuts all losses quickly.
It’s the only way to protect against the possible or probable chance of a
much larger loss from which it may not be possible to recover.
If you hesitate and allow a loss to increase to 20%, you will need a 25%
gain just to break even. Wait longer until the stock is down 25%, and you’ll
have to make 33% to get even. Wait still longer until the loss is 33%, and
you’ll have to make 50% to get back to the starting gate. The longer you
wait, the more the math works against you, so don’t vacillate. Move imme-
diately to cut out possible bad decisions. Develop the strict discipline to act
and to always follow your selling rules.
Some people have gone so far as to let losing stocks damage their health. In
this situation, it’s best to sell and stop worrying. I know a stockbroker who in
1961 bought Brunswick at $60 on the way down in price. It had been the mar-
ket’s super leader since 1957, increasing more than 20 times. When it
dropped to $50, he bought more, and when it dropped to $40, he added again.
When it dropped to $30, he dropped dead on the golf course.
History and human nature keep repeating themselves in the stock mar-
ket. In the fall of 2000, many investors made the identical mistake: they
bought the prior bull market’s leader, Cisco Systems, on the way down at
$70, $60, $50, and lower, after it had topped at $87. Seven months later it
had sunk to $13, an 80% decline for those who bought at $70. The moral of

When You Must Sell and Cut Every Loss . . . Without Exception
the story is: never argue with the market. Your health and peace of mind are
always more important than any stock.
Small losses are cheap insurance, and they’re the only insurance you can
buy on your investments. Even if a stock moves up after you sell it, as many
surely will, you will have accomplished your critical objective of keeping all
your losses small, and you’ll still have money to try again for a winner in
another stock.
Take Your Losses Quickly and Your Profits Slowly
There’s an old investment saying that the first loss in the market is the small-
est. In my view, the way to make investment decisions is to always (with no
exceptions) take your losses quickly and your profits slowly. Yet most
investors get emotionally confused and take their profits quickly and their
losses slowly.
What is your real risk in any stock you buy when you use the method
we’ve discussed? It’s 8%, no matter what you buy, if you follow this rule reli-
giously. Still, most investors stubbornly ask, “Shouldn’t we sit with stocks
rather than selling and taking a loss?” Or, “How about unusual situations
where some bad news hits suddenly and causes a price decline?” Or, “Does
this loss-cutting procedure apply all the time, or are there exceptions, like
when a company has a good new product?” The answer: there are no excep-
tions. None of these things changes the situation one bit. You must always
protect your hard-earned pool of capital.
Letting your losses run is the most serious mistake that almost all
investors make. You must accept the fact that mistakes in stock selection and
timing are going to be made frequently, even by the most experienced of
professional investors. I’d go so far as to say that if you aren’t willing to cut
short and limit your losses, you probably shouldn’t buy stocks. Would you
drive your car down the street without brakes? If you were a fighter pilot,
would you go into battle without a parachute?
Should You Average Down in Price?
One of the most unprofessional things a stockbroker can do is hesitate or fail
to call customers whose stocks are down in price. That’s when the customer
needs help the most. Shirking this duty in difficult periods shows a lack of
courage under pressure. About the only thing that’s worse is for brokers to
take themselves off the hook by advising customers to “average down” (buy
more of a stock that is already showing a loss). If I were advised to do this,
I’d close my account and look for a smarter broker.

BE SMART FROM THE START
Everyone loves to buy stocks; no one loves to sell them. As long as you
hold a stock, you can still hope it might come back up enough to at least get
you out even. Once you sell, you abandon all hope and accept the cold real-
ity of temporary defeat. Investors are always hoping rather than being real-
istic. Knowing and acting is better than hoping or guessing. The fact that
you want a stock to go up so you can at least get out even has nothing to do
with the action and brutal reality of the market. The market obeys only the
law of supply and demand.
A great trader once noted there are only two emotions in the market:
hope and fear. “The only problem,” he added, “is we hope when we should
fear, and we fear when we should hope.” This is just as true in 2009 as it was
in 1909.
The Turkey Story
Many years ago, I heard a story by Fred C. Kelly, the author of Why You
Win or Lose, that illustrates perfectly how the conventional investor thinks
when the time comes to make a selling decision:
A little boy was walking down the road when he came upon an old man
trying to catch wild turkeys. The man had a turkey trap, a crude device con-
sisting of a big box with the door hinged at the top. This door was kept open
by a prop, to which was tied a piece of twine leading back a hundred feet or
more to the operator. A thin trail of corn scattered along a path lured turkeys
to the box.
Once they were inside, the turkeys found an even more plentiful supply
of corn. When enough turkeys had wandered into the box, the old man
would jerk away the prop and let the door fall shut. Having once shut the
door, he couldn’t open it again without going up to the box, and this would
scare away any turkeys that were lurking outside. The time to pull away the
prop was when as many turkeys as one could reasonably expect were inside.
One day he had a dozen turkeys in his box. Then one sauntered out, leav-
ing 11. “Gosh, I wish I had pulled the string when all 12 were there,” said the
old man. “I’ll wait a minute and maybe the other one will go back.” While he
waited for the twelfth turkey to return, two more walked out on him. “I
should have been satisfied with 11,” the trapper said. “Just as soon as I get
one more back, I’ll pull the string.” Three more walked out, and still the man
waited. Having once had 12 turkeys, he disliked going home with less than 8.
He couldn’t give up the idea that some of the original turkeys would
return. When finally there was only one turkey left in the trap, he said, “I’ll
wait until he walks out or another goes in, and then I’ll quit.” The solitary
turkey went to join the others, and the man returned empty-handed.

When You Must Sell and Cut Every Loss . . . Without Exception
The psychology of normal investors is not much different. They hope
more turkeys will return to the box when they should fear that all the
turkeys could walk out and they’ll be left with nothing.
How the Typical Investor Thinks
If you’re a typical investor, you probably keep records of your transactions.
When you think about selling a stock, you probably look at your records to
see what price you paid for it. If you have a profit, you may sell, but if you
have a loss, you tend to wait. After all, you didn’t invest in the market to lose
money. However, what you should be doing is selling your worst-performing
stock first. Keep your flower patch free of weeds.
You may decide to sell your shares in Myriad Genetics, for example,
because it shows a nice profit, but you’ll keep your General Electric because
it still has a ways to go before it’s back to the price you paid for it. If this is
the way you think, you’re suffering from the “price-paid bias” that afflicts
95% of all investors.
Suppose you bought a stock two years ago at $30, and it’s now worth $34.
Most investors would sell it because they have a profit. But what does the
price you paid two years ago have to do with what the stock is worth now?
And what does it have to do with whether you should hold or sell the stock?
The key is the relative performance of this stock versus others you either
own or could potentially own.
Analyzing Your Activities
To help you avoid the price-paid bias, particularly if you are a longer-term
investor, I suggest you use a different method of analyzing your results. At
the end of each month or quarter, compute the percentage change in the
price of each stock from the last date you did this type of analysis. Now list
your investments in order of their relative price performance since your
previous evaluation period. Let’s say Caterpillar is down 6%, ITT is up 10%,
and General Electric is down 10%. Your list would start with ITT on top,
then Caterpillar, then GE. At the end of the next month or quarter, do the
same thing. After a few reviews, you will easily recognize the stocks that are
not doing well. They’ll be at the bottom of the list; those that did best will be
at or near the top.
This method isn’t foolproof, but it does force you to focus your attention
not on what you paid for your stocks, but on the relative performance of
your investments in the market. It will help you maintain a clearer perspec-
tive. Of course, you have to keep records of your costs for tax reasons, but

250
BE SMART FROM THE START
you should use this more realistic method in the longer-term management
of your portfolio. Doing this more often than once a quarter can only help
you. Eliminating the price-paid bias can be profitable and rewarding.
Any time you make a commitment to a security, you should also deter-
mine the potential profit and possible loss. This is only logical. You wouldn’t
buy a stock if there were a potential profit of 20% and a potential loss of
80%, would you? But if you don’t try to define these factors and operate by
well-thought-out rules, how do you know this isn’t the situation when you
make your stock purchase? Do you have specific selling rules you’ve written
down and follow, or are you flying blind?
I suggest you write down the price at which you expect to sell if you
have a loss (8% or less below your purchase price) along with the expected
profit potential of all the securities you purchase. For instance, you might
consider selling your growth stock when its P/E ratio increases 100% or
more from the time the stock originally began its big move out of its initial
base pattern.
If you write these numbers down, you’ll more easily see when the stock
has reached one of these levels.
It’s bad business to base your sell decisions on your cost and hold stocks
down in price simply because you can’t accept the fact you made an impru-
dent selection and lost money. In fact, you’re making the exact opposite deci-
sions from those you would make if you were running your own business.
The Red Dress Story
Investing in the stock market is really no different from running your
own business. Investing is a business and should be operated as such.
Assume that you own a small store selling women’s clothing. You’ve
bought and stocked women’s dresses in three colors: yellow, green, and
red. The red dresses go quickly, half the green ones sell, and the yellows
don’t sell at all.
What do you do about it? Do you go to your buyer and say, “The red
dresses are all sold out. The yellow ones don’t seem to have any demand, but
I still think they’re good. Besides, yellow is my favorite color, so let’s buy
some more of them anyway”?
Certainly not!
The clever merchandiser who survives in the retail business looks at this
predicament objectively and says, “We sure made a mistake. We’d better get
rid of the yellow dresses. Let’s have a sale. Mark them down 10%. If they
don’t sell at that price, mark them down 20%. Let’s get our money out of
those ‘old dogs’ no one wants, and put it into more of the hot-moving red

dresses that are in demand.” This is common sense in any retail business.
Do you do this with your investments? Why not?
Everyone makes buying errors. The buyers for department stores are
pros, but even they make mistakes. If you do slip up, recognize it, sell, and
go on to the next thing. You don’t have to be correct on all your investment
decisions to make a good net profit.
Now you know the real secret to reducing your risk and selecting the best
stocks: stop counting your turkeys and get rid of your yellow dresses!
Are You a Speculator or an Investor?
There are two often-misunderstood words that are used to describe the
kinds of people who participate in the stock market: speculator and investor.
When you think of the word speculator, you might think of someone who
takes big risks, gambling on the future success of a stock. Conversely, when
you think of the word investor, you might think of someone who approaches
the stock market in a sensible and rational manner. According to these con-
ventional definitions, you may think it’s smarter to be an investor.
Baruch, however, defined speculator as follows: “The word speculator
comes from the Latin ‘speculari,’ which means to spy and observe. A specu-
lator, therefore, is a person who observes and acts before [the future]
occurs.” This is precisely what you should be doing: watching the market
and individual stocks to determine what they’re doing now, and then acting
on that information.
Jesse Livermore, another stock market legend, defined investorthis way:
“Investors are the big gamblers. They make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes
wrong, they lose it all.” After reading this far, you should already know this is
not the proper way to invest. There’s no such thing as a long-term investment
once a stock drops into the loss column and you’re down 8% below your cost.
These definitions are a bit different from those you’ll read in Webster’s
Dictionary, but they are far more accurate. Keep in mind that Baruch and
Livermore at many times made millions of dollars in the stock market. I’m
not sure about lexicographers.
One of my goals is to get you to question many of the faulty investment
ideas, beliefs, and methods that you’ve heard about or used in the past. One
of these is the very notion of what it means to invest. It’s unbelievable how
much erroneous information about the stock market, how it works, and how
to succeed at it is out there. Learn to objectively analyze all the relevant
facts about a stock and about how the market is behaving. Stop listening to
and being influenced by friends, associates, and the continuous array of
experts’ personal opinions on daily TV shows.

BE SMART FROM THE START
For Safety, Why Not Diversify Widely?
Wide diversification is a substitute for lack of knowledge. It sounds good,
and it’s what most people advise. But in a bad bear market, almost all of your
stocks will go down, and you could lose 50% percent or more in some stocks
that will never come back. So diversification is a poor substitute for a sound
defensive plan with rules to protect your account. Also, if you have 20 or 30
stocks and you sell 3 or 4, it won’t help you when you lose heavily on the rest.
“I’m Not Worried; I’m a Long-Term Investor,
and I’m Still Getting My Dividends”
It’s also risky and possibly foolish to say to yourself, “I’m not worried about
my stocks being down because they are good stocks, and I’m still getting my
dividends.” Good stocks bought at the wrong time can go down as much as
poor stocks, and it’s possible they might not be such good stocks in the first
place. It may just be your personal opinion they’re good.
Furthermore, if a stock is down 35% in value, isn’t it rather absurd to say
you’re all right because you are getting a 4% dividend yield? A 35% loss plus
a 4% income gain equals a whopping 31% net loss.
To be a successful investor, you must face facts and stop rationalizing and
hoping. No one emotionally wants to take losses, but to increase your
chances of success in the stock market, you have to do many things you don’t
want to do. Develop precise rules and hard-nosed selling disciplines, and
you’ll gain a major advantage.
Never Lose Your Confidence
There’s one last critical reason for you to take losses before they have a
chance to really hurt you: never lose your courage to make decisions in the
future. If you don’t sell to cut your losses when you begin to get into trou-
ble, you can easily lose the confidence you’ll need to make buy and sell deci-
sions in the future. Or, far worse, you can get so discouraged that you finally
throw in the towel and get out of the market, never realizing what you did
wrong, never correcting your faulty procedures, and giving up all the future
potential the stock market—one of the most outstanding opportunities in
America—has to offer.
Wall Street is human nature on daily display. Buying and selling stocks
properly and making a net profit are always a complicated affair. Human
nature being what it is, 90% of people in the stock market—professionals
and amateurs alike—simply haven’t done much homework. They haven’t

really studied to learn whether what they’re doing is right or wrong. They
haven’t studied in enough detail what makes a successful stock go up and
down. Luck has nothing to do with it, and it’s not a total mystery. And it cer-
tainly isn’t a “random walk” or an efficient market, as some inexperienced
university professors formerly believed.
It takes some work to become really good at stock selection, and still
more to know how and when to sell. Selling a stock correctly is a tougher job
and the one that is least understood by everyone. To do it right, you need a
plan to cut losses and the discipline to do this quickly without wavering.
Forget your ego, swallow your pride, stop trying to argue with the market,
and don’t get emotionally attached to any stock that’s losing you money.
Remember: there are no good stocks; they’re all bad . . . unless they go up
in price. Learn from the 2000 and 2008 experience. Those who followed
our selling rules protected their capital and nailed down gains.
Those who did not have or follow any selling rules got hurt.

• CHAPTER •
When to Sell and Take Your
Worthwhile Profits
This is one of the most vital chapters in this book, covering an essential subject
few investors handle well. So study it very carefully. Common stock is just
like any other merchandise. You, as the merchant, must sell your stock if
you’re to realize a profit, and the best way to sell a stock is when it’s on the
way up, while it’s still advancing and looking strong to everyone else.
This may be contrary to your human nature, because it means selling
when your stock is strong, is up a lot in price, and looks like it could make
even more profit for you. But if you do this, you won’t get caught in the
heartrending 20% to 40% corrections that can hit market leaders and put
downside pressure on your portfolio. You’ll never sell at the exact top, so
don’t kick yourself if a stock goes still higher after you sell.
If you don’t sell early, you’ll be late. The object is to make and
take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or
emotionally carried away as your stock’s advance gets stronger.
Keep in mind the old saying: “Bulls make money and bears make money,
but pigs get slaughtered.”
The basic objective of every account should be to show a net profit. To
retain worthwhile profits, you must sell and take them. The key is knowing
when to do just that.
Bernard Baruch, the financier who built a fortune in the stock market,
said, “Repeatedly, I have sold a stock while it was still rising—and that has
been one reason why I have held on to my fortune. Many a time, I might

have made a good deal more by holding a stock, but I would also have been
caught in the fall when the price of the stock collapsed.”
When asked if there was a technique for making money on the stock
exchange, Nathan Rothschild, the highly successful international banker, said,
“There certainly is. I never buy at the bottom, and I always sell too soon.”
Joe Kennedy, one-time Wall Street speculator and father of former
President John F. Kennedy, believed “only a fool holds out for the top
dollar.” “The object,” he said, “is to get out while a stock is up before it
has a chance to break and turn down.” And Gerald M. Loeb, a highly suc-
cessful financier, stressed “once the price has risen into estimated normal
or overvaluation areas, the amount held should be reduced steadily as
quotations advance.”
What all these Wall Street legends believed was this: you simply must get
out while the getting is good. The secret is to hop off the elevator on one of
the floors on the way up and not ride it back down again.
You Must Develop a Profit-and-Loss Plan
To be a big success in the stock market, you need definite rules and a profit-
and-loss plan. I developed many of the buy and sell rules described in this
book in the early 1960s, when I was a young stockbroker with Hayden,
Stone. These rules helped me buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange
and start my own firm shortly thereafter. When I started out, though, I con-
centrated on developing a set of buy rules that would locate the very best
stocks. But as you’ll see, I had only half of the puzzle figured out.
My buy rules were first developed in January 1960, when I analyzed the
three best-performing mutual funds of the prior two years. The standout
was the then-small Dreyfus Fund, which racked up gains twice as large as
those of many of its competitors.
I sent away for copies of every Dreyfus quarterly report and prospectus
from 1957 to 1959. Then I calculated the average cost of each new stock the
fund had purchased. Next, I got a book of stock charts and marked in red
the average price Dreyfus had paid for its new holdings each quarter.
After looking at more than a hundred new Dreyfus purchases, I made a
stunning discovery: every stock had been bought at the highest price it had
sold for in the past year. In other words, if a stock had bounced between $40
and $50 for many months, Dreyfus bought it as soon as it made a new high
in price and traded between $50 and $51. The stocks had also formed cer-
tain chart price patterns before leaping into new high ground. This gave me
two vitally important clues: buying on new highs was important, and certain
chart patterns spelled big profit potential.

BE SMART FROM THE START
Jack Dreyfus Was a Chartist
Jack Dreyfus was a chartist and a tape reader. He bought all his stocks based
on market action, and only when the price broke to new highs off sound
chart patterns. He was also beating the pants off every competitor who
ignored the real-world facts of market behavior (supply and demand) and
depended only on fundamental, analytical personal opinions.
Jack’s research department in those early, big-performance days con-
sisted of three young Turks who posted the day’s price and volume action of
hundreds of listed stocks to very oversized charts. I saw these charts one day
when I visited Dreyfus’s headquarters in New York.
Shortly thereafter, two small funds run by Fidelity in Boston started
doing the same thing. They, too, produced superior results. One was man-
aged by Ned Johnson, Jr., and the other by Jerry Tsai. Almost all the stocks
that the Dreyfus and Fidelity funds bought also had strong increases in their
quarterly earnings reports.
So the first buy rules I made in 1960 were as follows:
1. Concentrate on listed stocks that sell for more than $20 a share with at
least some institutional acceptance.
2. Insist that the company show increases in earnings per share in each of
the past five years and that the current quarterly earnings are up at least
20%.
3. Buy when the stock is making or about to make a new high in price after
emerging from a sound correction and price consolidation period. This
breakout should be accompanied by a volume increase to at least 50%
above the stock’s average daily volume.
The first stock I bought under my new set of buy rules was Universal
Match in February 1960. It doubled in 16 weeks, but I failed to make much
money because I didn’t have much money to invest. I was just getting
started as a stockbroker, and I didn’t have many customers. I also got ner-
vous and sold it too quickly. Later that year, sticking with my well-defined
game plan, I selected Procter & Gamble, Reynolds Tobacco, and MGM.
They, too, made outstanding price moves, but I still didn’t make much
money because the money I had to invest was limited.
About this time, I was accepted to Harvard Business School’s first Pro-
gram for Management Development (PMD). In what little extra time I had
at Harvard, I read a number of business and investment books in the library.
The best was How to Trade in Stocks, by Jesse Livermore. From this book,
I learned that your objective in the market was not to be right, but to make
big money when you were right.

When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits
Jesse Livermore and Pyramiding
After reading his book, I adopted Livermore’s method of pyramiding, or
averaging up, when a stock advanced after I purchased it. “Averaging up” is
a technique where, after your initial stock purchase, you buy additional
shares of the stock when it moves up in price. This is usually warranted
when the first purchase of a stock is made precisely at a correct pivot, or buy,
point and the price has increased 2% or 3% from the original purchase
price. Essentially, I followed up what was working with additional but
always smaller purchases, allowing me to concentrate my buying when I
seemed to be right. If I was wrong and the stock dropped a certain amount
below my cost, I sold the stock to cut short every loss.
This is very different from how the majority of people invest. Most of
them average down, meaning they buy additional shares as a stock declines
in price in order to lower their cost per share. But why add more of your
hard-earned money to stocks that aren’t working?
Learning by Analysis of My Failures
In the first half of 1961, my rules and plan worked great. Some of the top
winners I bought that year were Great Western Financial, Brunswick, Kerr-
McGee, Crown Cork & Seal, AMF, and Certain-teed. But by summer, all
was not well.
I had bought the right stocks at exactly the right time and I had pyra-
mided with several additional buys, so I had good positions and profits. But
when the stocks finally topped, I held on too long and watched my profits
vanish. If you’ve been investing for a while, I’ll bet you know exactly what
I’m talking about. It’s a problem you must tackle and solve if you want real
results. When you snooze, you lose. It was hard to swallow. I’d been dead
right on my stock selections for more than a year, but I had just broken even.
I was so upset that I spent the last six months of 1961 carefully analyzing
every transaction I had made during the prior year. Much like doctors do
postmortem operations and the Civil Aeronautics Board conducts postcrash
investigations, I took a red pen and marked on charts exactly where each buy
and sell decision was made. Then I overlaid the general market averages.
Eventually my problem became crystal clear: I knew how to select the
best leading stocks, but I had no plan for when to sell them and take profits.
I had been completely clueless, a real dummy. I was so unaware that I had
never even thought about when should a stock be sold and a profit taken.
My stocks went up and then down like yo-yos, and my paper profits were
wiped out.

BE SMART FROM THE START
For example, the way I handled Certain-teed, a building materials com-
pany that made shell homes, was especially poor. I bought the stock in the
low $20s, but during a weak moment in the market, I got scared and sold it
for only a two- or three-point gain. Certain-teed went on to triple in price. I
was in at the right time, but I didn’t recognize what I had and failed to cap-
italize on a phenomenal opportunity.
My analysis of Certain-teed and other such personal failures proved to be
the critical key to my seeing what I had been doing wrong that I had to cor-
rect if I was to get on the right track to future success. Have you ever ana-
lyzed every one of your failures so you can learn from them? Few people do.
What a tragic mistake you’ll make if you don’t look carefully at yourself and
the decisions you’ve made in the stock market that did not work. You get
better only when you learn what you’ve done wrong.
This is the difference between winners and losers, whether in the market
or in life. If you got hurt in the 2000 or 2008 bear market, don’t get discour-
aged and quit. Plot out your mistakes on charts, study them, and write some
additional new rules that, if you follow them, will correct your mistakes and
let you avoid the actions that cost you a lot of time and money. You’ll be that
much closer to fully capitalizing on the next bull market. And in America,
there will be many future bull markets. You’re never a loser until you quit
and give up or start blaming other people, like most politicians do. If you do
what I’ve suggested here, it could just change your whole life.
“There are no secrets to success,” said General Colin Powell, former sec-
retary of state. “It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from
failure.”
My Revised Profit-and-Loss Plan
As a result of my analysis, I discovered that successful stocks, after breaking
out of a proper base, tend to move up 20% to 25%. Then they usually
decline, build new bases, and in some cases resume their advances. With
this new knowledge in mind, I made a rule that I’d buy each stock exactly at
the pivot buy point and have the discipline not to pyramid or add to my posi-
tion at more than 5% past that point. Then I’d sell each stock when it was up
20%, while it was still advancing.
In the case of Certain-teed, however, the stock ran up 20% in just two
weeks. This was the type of super winner I was hoping to find and capital-
ize on the next time around. So, I made an absolutely important exception
to the “sell at +20% rule”: if the stock was so powerful that it vaulted 20%
in only one, two, or three weeks, it had to be held for at least eight weeks.
Then it would be analyzed to see if it should be held for a possible six-

When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits
month long-term capital gain. (Six months was the long-term capital gains
period at that time.) If a stock fell below its purchase price by 8%, I would
sell it and take the loss.
So, here was the revised profit-and-loss plan: take 20% profits when you
have them (except with the most powerful of all stocks) and cut your losses
at a maximum of 8% below your purchase price.
The plan had several big advantages. You could be wrong twice and right
once and still not get into financial trouble. When you were right and you
wanted to follow up with another, somewhat smaller buy in the same stock
a few points higher, you were frequently forced into a decision to sell one of
your more laggard or weakest performers. The money in your slower-per-
forming stock positions was continually force-fed into your best performers.
Over a period of years, I came to almost always make my first follow-up
purchase automatically as soon as my initial buy was up 2% or 2½% in price.
This lessened the chance that I might hesitate and wind up making the addi-
tional buy when the stock was up 5% to 10%.
When you appear to be right, you should always follow up. When a boxer
in the ring finally has an opening and lands a powerful punch, he must
always follow up his advantage . . . if he wants to win.
By selling your laggards and putting the proceeds into your winners, you
are putting your money to far more efficient use. You could make two or
three 20% plays in a good year, and you wouldn’t have to sit through so many
long, unproductive corrections while a stock built a whole new base.
A 20% gain in three to six months is substantially more productive than a
20% gain that takes 12 months to achieve. Two 20% gains compounded in
one year equals a 44% annual rate of return. When you’re more experi-
enced, you can use full margin (buying power in a margin account), and
increase your compounded return to nearly 100%.
How I Discovered the General Market System
Another exceedingly profitable observation I made from analyzing every
one of my money-losing, out-of-ignorance mistakes was that most of my
market-leading stocks that topped had done so because the general market
started into a decline of 10% or more. This conclusion finally led to my dis-
covering and developing our system of interpreting the daily general market
averages’ price and volume chart. It gave us the critical ability to establish
the true trend and major changes of direction in the overall market.
Three months later, by April 1, 1962, following all of my selling rules had
automatically forced me out of every stock. I was 100% in cash, with no idea
the market was headed for a real crash that spring. This is the fascinating

thing: the rules will force you out, but you don’t know how bad it can really
get. You just know it’s going down and you’re out, which sooner or later will
be worth its weight in gold to you. That’s what happened in 2008. Our rules
forced us out, and we had no idea the market was headed for a major break-
down. Most institutional investors were affected because their investment
policy was to be fully invested (95% to 100%).
In early 1962, I had finished reading Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,
by Edwin LeFevre. I was struck by the parallels between the stock market
panic of 1907, which LeFevre discussed in detail, and what seemed to be
happening in April 1962. Since I was 100% in cash and my daily Dow analy-
sis said the market was weak at that point, I began to sell short stocks such
as Certain-teed and Alside (an earlier sympathy play to Certain-teed). For
this, I got into trouble with Hayden, Stone’s home office on Wall Street. The
firm had just recommended Certain-teed as a buy, and here I was going
around telling everyone it was a short sale. Later in the year, I sold Korvette
short at over $40. The profits from both of these short sales were good.
By October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis, I was again in cash. A
day or two after the Soviet Union backed down from President Kennedy’s
wise naval blockade, a rally attempt in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fol-
lowed through, signaling a major upturn according to my new system. I then
bought the first stock of the new bull market, Chrysler, at 585⁄. It had a clas-
8
sic cup-with-handle base.
Throughout 1963, I simply followed my rules to the letter. They worked
so well that the “worst”-performing account I managed that year was up
115%. It was a cash account. Other accounts that used margin were up sev-
eral hundred percent. There were many individual stock losses, but they
were usually small, averaging 5% to 6%. Profits, on the other hand, were
awesome because of the concentrated positions we built by careful, disci-
plined pyramiding when we were right.
Starting with only $4,000 or $5,000 that I had saved from my salary, plus
some borrowed money and the use of full margin, I had three back-to-back
big winners: Korvette on the short side in late 1962, Chrysler on the buy
side, and Syntex, which was bought at $100 per share with the Chrysler
profit in June 1963. After eight weeks, Syntex was up 40%, and I decided to
play this powerful stock out for six months. By the fall of 1963, the profit had
topped $200,000, and I decided to buy a seat on the New York Stock
Exchange. So don’t ever let anyone tell you it can’t be done! You can learn
to invest wisely as long as you’re willing to study all of your mistakes, learn
from them, and write new self-correcting rules. This can be the greatest
opportunity of a lifetime, if you are determined, not easily discouraged, and
willing to work hard and prepare yourself. Anyone can make it happen.

When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits
For me, many long evenings of study led to precise rules, disciplines, and
a plan that finally worked. Luck had nothing to do with it; it was persistence
and hard work. You can’t expect to watch television, drink beer, or party with
your friends every night and still find the answers to something as compli-
cated as the stock market or the U.S. economy.
In America, anyone can do anything by working at it. There are no limits
placed on you. It all depends on your desire and your attitude. It makes no
difference where you’re from, what you look like, or where you went to
school. You can improve your life and your future and capture the American
Dream. And you don’t have to have a lot of money to start.
If you get discouraged at times, don’t ever give up. Go back and put in
some detailed extra effort. It’s always the study and learning time that you
put in afternine to five, Monday through Friday, that ultimately makes the
difference between winning and reaching your goals, and missing out on
truly great opportunities that really can change your whole life.
Two Things to Remember about Selling
Before we examine the key selling rules one by one, keep these two key
points in mind.
First, buying precisely right solves most of your selling problems. If you
buy at exactly the right time off a proper daily or weekly chart base in the
first place, and you do not chase or pyramid a stock when it’s extended in
price more than 5% past a correct pivot buy point, you will be in a position
to sit through most normal corrections. Winning stocks very rarely drop 8%
below a correct pivot buy point. In fact, most big winners don’t close below
their pivot point. Buying as close to the pivot point as possible is therefore
absolutely essential and may let you cut the smaller number of resulting
losses more quickly than 8%. A stock might have to drop only 4% or 5%
before you know something could be wrong.
Second, beware of the big-block selling you might see on a ticker
tape or your PC just after you buy a stock during a bull market. The sell-
ing might be emotional, uninformed, temporary, or not as large (rela-
tive to past volume) as it appears. The best stocks can have sharp
sell-offs for a few days or a week. Consult a weekly basis stock chart for
an overall perspective to avoid getting scared or shaken out in what may
just be a normal pullback. In fact, 40% to 60% of the time, a winning
stock may pull back to its exact buy point or slightly below and try to
shake you out. But it should not be down 8% unless you chased it too
high in price when you bought it. If you’re making too many mistakes
and nothing seems to be working for you, check and make sure you’re

BE SMART FROM THE START
not making a number of your buys 10%, 15%, or 20% above the precise,
correct buy point. Chasing stocks rarely works. You can’t buy when you
get more excited.
Technical Sell Signs
By studying how the greatest stock market winners, as well as the market
itself, all topped, I came up with the following list of factors that occur
when a stock tops and rolls over. Perhaps you’ve noticed that few of the
selling rules involve changes in the fundamentals of a stock. Many big
investors get out of a stock before trouble appears on the income state-
ment. If the smart money is selling, so should you. Individual investors
don’t stand much chance when institutions begin liquidating large posi-
tions. You buy with heavy emphasis on the fundamentals, such as earnings,
sales, profit margins, return on equity, and new products, but many stocks
peak when earnings are up 100% and analysts are projecting continued
growth and higher price targets.
On the same day in 1999 that I sold Charles Schwab stock on a climax
top run-up and an exhaustion gap, one of the largest brokerage firms in
America projected that the stock would go up 50 points more. Virtually all
of my successful stocks were sold on the way up, while they were advanc-
ing and the market was not affected. A bird in the hand is worth two imag-
inary ones in the bush. Therefore, you must frequently sell based on
unusual market action (price and volume movement), not personal opin-
ions from Wall Street. You must wean yourself from listening to personal
opinions. Since I never worked on Wall Street, I never got distracted by
these diversions.
There are many signals to look for when you’re trying to recognize when
a stock could be in a topping process. These include the price movement
surrounding climax tops, adverse volume, and other weak action. A lot of
this will become clearer to you as you continue to study this information and
apply it to your daily decision making. These rules and principles have been
responsible for most of my better decisions in the market, but they can seem
a bit complicated at first. I suggest that you reread Chapter 2 on chart read-
ing, then read these selling rules again.
In fact, most of the IBD subscribers I’ve met at our hundreds of work-
shops who have enjoyed real success with their investments have told me
that they read this entire book two or three times, or even more. You prob-
ably aren’t going to get it all in one reading. Some who have been distracted
by all the outside noise say that they read it periodically to help them get
back on the right track.

Climax Tops
Many leading stocks top in an explosive fashion. They make climax runs—
suddenly advancing at a much faster rate for one or two weeks after an
advance of many months. In addition, they often end in exhaustion gaps—
when a stock’s price opens up on a gap from the prior day’s close, on heavy vol-
ume. These and related bull market climax signals are discussed in detail here.
1. Largest daily price run-up.If a stock’s price is extended—that is, if
it’s had a significant run-up for many months from its buy point off a
sound and proper base—and it closes for the day with a larger price
increase than on any previous up day since the beginning of the whole
move up, watch out! This usually occurs very close to a stock’s peak.
2. Heaviest daily volume.The ultimate top might occur on the heaviest
volume day since the beginning of the advance.
3. Exhaustion gap. If a stock that’s been advancing rapidly is greatly
extended from its original base many months ago (usually at least 18
weeks out of a first- or second-stage base and 12 weeks or more if it’s
out of a later-stage base) and then opens on a gap up in price from the
previous day’s close, the advance is near its peak. For example, a two-
point gap in a stock’s price after a long run-up would occur if it closed
at its high of $50 for the day, then opened the next morning at $52 and
held above $52 during the day. This is called an exhaustion gap.
4. Climax top activity.Sell if a stock’s advance gets so active that it has a
rapid price run-up for two or three weeks on a weekly chart, or for
seven of eight days in a row or eight of ten days on a daily chart. This is
called a climax top. The price spread from the stock’s low to its high for
the week will almost always be greater than that for any prior week
since the beginning of the original move many months ago.
In a few cases, around the top of a climax run, a stock may retrace
the prior week’s large price spread from the prior week’s low to its high
point and close the week up a little, with volume remaining very high.
I call this “railroad tracks” because on a weekly chart, you’ll see two
parallel vertical lines. This is a sign of continued heavy volume distrib-
ution without real additional price progress for the week.
5. Signs of distribution.After a long advance, heavy daily volume with-
out further upside price progress signals distribution. Sell your stock
before unsuspecting buyers are overwhelmed. Also know when savvy
investors are due to have a long-term capital gain.
6. Stock splits.Sell if a stock runs up 25% to 50% for one or two weeks
on a stock split. In a few rare cases, such as Qualcomm at the end of

BE SMART FROM THE START
1999, it could be 100%. Stocks tend to top around excessive stock
splits. If a stock’s price is extended from its base and a stock split is
announced, in many cases the stock could be sold.
7. Increase in consecutive down days.For most stocks, the number of
consecutive down days in price relative to up days in price will proba-
bly increase when the stock starts down from its top. You may see four
or five days down, followed by two or three days up, whereas before
you would have seen four days up and then two or three down.
8. Upper channel line.You should sell if a stock goes through its upper
channel line after a huge run-up. (On a stock chart, channel lines are
somewhat parallel lines drawn by connecting the lows of the price pat-
tern with one straight line and then connecting three high points made
over the past four to five months with another straight line.) Studies
show that stocks that surge above their properly drawnupper channel
lines should be sold.
9. 200-day moving average line. Some stocks may be sold when they
are 70% to 100% or more above their 200-day moving average price
line, although I have rarely used this one.
10. Selling on the way down from the top.If you didn’t sell early while
the stock was still advancing, sell on the way down from the peak. After
the first breakdown, some stocks may pull back up in price once.

Low Volume and Other Weak Action
1. New highs on low volume.Some stocks will make new highs on lower
or poor volume. As the stock goes higher, volume trends lower, suggest-
ing that big investors have lost their appetite for the stock.
2. Closing at or near the day’s price low. Tops can also be seen on a
stock’s daily chart in the form of “arrows” pointing down. That is, for sev-
eral days, the stock will close at or near the low of the daily price range,
fully retracing the day’s advance.
3. Third- or fourth-stage bases.Sell when your stock makes a new high
in price off a third- or fourth-stage base. The third time is seldom a
charm in the market. By then, an advancing stock has become too obvi-
ous, and almost everyone sees it. These late-stage base patterns are often
faulty, appearing wider and looser. As much as 80% of fourth-stage bases
should fail, but you have to be right in determining that this is a fourth-
stage base.
4. Signs of a poor rally. When you see initial heavy selling near the top,
the next recovery will follow through weaker in volume, show poor price
recovery, or last fewer days. Sell on the second or third day of a poor
rally; it may be the last good chance to sell before trend lines and support
areas are broken.
5. Decline from the peak.After a stock declines 8% or so from its peak,
in some cases examination of the previous run-up, the top, and the
decline may help you determine whether the advance is over or whether
a normal 8% to 15% correction is in progress. You may occasionally want
to sell if a decline from the peak exceeds 12% or 15%.

When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits
6. Poor relative strength. Poor relative price strength can be another
reason for selling. Consider selling when a stock’s IBD’s Relative Price
Strength Rating drops below 70.
7. Lone Ranger.Consider selling if there is no confirming price strength
by any other important member of the same industry group.
Breaking Support
Breaking support occurs when stocks close for the week below established
major trend lines.
1. Long-term uptrend line is broken.Sell if a stock closes at the end of
the week below a major long-term uptrend line or breaks a key price
support area on overwhelmingvolume. An uptrend line should connect
at least three intraday or intraweek price lows occurring over a number
of months. Trend lines drawn over too short a time period aren’t valid.
2. Greatest one-day price drop.If a stock has already made an extended
advance and suddenly makes its greatest one-day price drop since the
beginning of the move, consider selling if the move is confirmed by other
signals.
3. Falling price on heavy weekly volume.In some cases, sell if a stock
breaks down on the largest weekly volume in its prior several years.
4. 200-day moving average line turns down. After a prolonged
upswing, if a stock’s 200-day moving average price line turns down, con-
sider selling the stock. Also, sell on new highs if a stock has a weak base
with much of the price work in the lower half of the base or below the
200-day moving average price line.
5. Living below the 10-week moving average. Consider selling if a
stock has a long advance, then closes below its 10-week moving average
and lives below that average for eight or nine consecutive weeks, unable
to rally and close the week above the line.
Other Prime Selling Pointers
1. If you cut all your losses at 7% or 8%, take a few profits when you’re up
20%, 25%, or 30%. Compounding three gains like this could give you an
overall gain of 100% or more. However, don’t sell and take a 25% or 30%
gain in any market leader with institutional support that’s run up 20% in
only one, two, or three weeks from the pivot buy point on a proper base.
Those could be your big leaders and should be held for a potentially
greater profit.

BE SMART FROM THE START
2. If you’re in a bear market, get off margin, raise more cash, and don’t buy
very many stocks. If you do buy, maybe you should take 15% profits and
cut all your losses at 3%.
3. In order to sell, big investors must have buyers to absorb their
stock. Therefore, consider selling if a stock runs up and then good news
or major publicity (a cover article in BusinessWeek, for example) is
released.
4. Sell when there’s a great deal of excitement about a stock and it’s obvious
to everyone that the stock is going higher. By then it’s too late. Jack Drey-
fus said, “Sell when there is an overabundanceof optimism. When every-
one is bubbling over with optimism and running around trying to get
everyone else to buy, they are fully invested. At this point, all they can do
is talk. They can’t push the market up anymore. It takes buying power to
do that.” Buy when you’re scared to death and others are unsure. Wait
until you’re happy and tickled to death to sell.
5. In most cases, sell when the percentage increases in quarterly earnings
slow materially (or by two-thirds from the prior rate of increase) for two
consecutive quarters.
6. Be careful of selling on bad news or rumors; they may be of temporary
influence. Rumors are sometimes started to scare individual investors—
the little fish—out of their holdings.
7. Always learn from all your past selling mistakes. Do your own postanaly-
sis by plotting your past buy and sell points on charts. Study your mis-
takes carefully, and write down additional rules to avoid past mistakes
that caused excessive losses or big missed opportunities. That’s how you
become a savvy investor.
When to Be Patient and Hold a Stock
Closely related to the decision on when to sell is when to sit tight. Here are
some suggestions for doing just that.
Buy growth stocks where you can project a potential price target based on
earnings estimates for the next year or two and possible P/E expansion from
the stock’s original base breakout. Your objective is to buy the best stock
with the best earnings at exactly the right time and to have the patience to
hold it until you have been proven right or wrong.
In a few cases, you may have to allow 13 weeks after your first purchase
before you conclude that a stock that hasn’t moved is a dull, faulty selection.
This, of course, applies only if the stock did not reach your defensive, loss-
cutting sell price first. In a fast-paced market, like the one in 1999, tech
stocks that didn’t move after several weeks while the general market was ral-

When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits
lying could have been sold earlier, and the money moved into other stocks
that were breaking out of sound bases with top fundamentals.
When your hard-earned money is on the line, it’s more important than
ever to pay attention to the general market and check IBD’s “The Big Pic-
ture” column, which analyzes the market averages. In both the 2000 top and
the top in the 2007–2008 market, “The Big Picture” column and our sell
rules got many subscribers out of the market and helped them dodge dev-
astating declines.
If you make new purchases when the market averages are under distrib-
ution, topping, and starting to reverse direction, you’ll have trouble holding
the stocks you’ve bought. (Most breakouts will fail, and most stocks will go
down, so stay in phase with the general market. Don’t argue with a declin-
ing market.)
After a new purchase, draw a defensive sell line in red on a daily or
weekly graph at the precise price level at which you will sell and cut your
loss (8% or less below your buy point). In the first one to two years of a new
bull market, you may want to give stocks this much room on the downside
and hold them until the price touches the sell line before selling.
In some instances, the sell line may be raised but kept below the low of
the first normal correction after your initial purchase. If you raise your loss-
cutting sell point, don’t move it up too close to the current price. This will
keep you from being shaken out during any normal weakness.
You definitely shouldn’t continue to follow a stock up by raising stop-loss
orders because you will be forced out near the low of an inevitable, natural
correction. Once your stock is 15% or more above your purchase price, you
can begin to concentrate on the price where or under what rules you will sell
it on the way up to nail down your profit.
Any stock that rises close to 20% should never be allowed to drop back
into the loss column. If you buy a stock at $50 and it shoots up to $60
(+20%) or more, even if you don’t take the profit when you have it, there’s
no intelligent reason to ever let the stock drop all the way back to $50 or
below and create a loss. You may feel embarrassed, ridiculous, and not too
bright if you buy at $50, watch the stock hit $60, and then sell at $50 to $51.
But you’ve already made the mistake of not taking your profit. Now avoid
making a second mistake by letting it develop into a loss. Remember, one
important objective is to keep all your losses as small as possible.
Also, major advances require time to complete. Don’t take profits during
the first eight weeks of a move unless the stock gets into serious trouble or
is having a two- or three-week “climax” run-up on a stock split in a late-stage
base. Stocks that show a 20% profit in less than eight weeks should be held
through the eight weeks unless they are of poor quality without institutional

BE SMART FROM THE START
sponsorship or strong group action. In many cases, stocks that advance dra-
matically by 20% or more in only one to four weeks are the most powerful
stocks of all—capable of doubling, tripling, or more. If you own one of these
true CAN SLIM market leaders, try to hold it through the first couple of
times it pulls back in price to, or slightly below, its 10-week moving average
price line. Once you have a decent profit, you could also try to hold the stock
through its first short-term correction of 10% to 20%.
When a stock breaks out of a proper base, after its first move up, 80% of
the time it will pull back somewhere between its second and its sixth week
out of the base. Holding for eight weeks, of course, gets you through this
first selling squall and into a resumed uptrend, and you’ll then have a better
profit cushion.
Remember, your objective is not just to be right but to make big money
when you are right. “It never is your thinking that makes big money,” said
Livermore. “It’s the sitting.” Investors who can be right and sit tight are rare.
It takes time for a stock to make a large gain.
The first two years of a new bull market typically provide your best and
safest period, but they require courage, patience, and profitable sitting. If
you really know and understand a company thoroughly and its products
well, you’ll have the crucial additional confidence required to sit tight
through several inevitable but normal corrections. Achieving giant profits in
a stock takes time and patience and following rules.
You’ve just read one of the most valuable chapters in this book. If you
review it several times and adopt a disciplined profit-and-loss plan for your
own investments, it could be worth several thousand times what you paid
for this book. You might even make a point of rereading this chapter once
every year.
You can’t become a big winner in the market until you learn to be a good
seller as well as a good buyer. The readers who followed these historically
proven sell rules during 2000 nailed down most of the substantial gains they
had made in 1998 and 1999. A few serious students made 500% to 1,000%
or more during that fast-moving period. Again in 2008, an even greater per-
centage of IBD readers, although not every one, after much work and study
were able to implement proper selling rules to protect and preserve their
hard-earned capital rather than succumb to the dramatic declines in the
year’s third and fourth quarters.

Money Management: Should You
Diversify, Invest for the Long
Haul, Use Margin, Sell Short, or
Buy Options, IPOs, Tax Shelters,
Nasdaq Stocks, Foreign Stocks,
Bonds, or Other Assets?
Once you have decided to participate in the stock market, you are faced with
more decisions than just which stock to purchase. You have to decide how
you will handle your portfolio, how many stocks you should buy, what types
of actions you will take, and what types of investments are better left alone.
This and the following chapter will introduce you to the many options
and alluring diversions you have at your disposal. Some of them are benefi-
cial and worthy of your attention, but many others are overly risky,
extremely complicated, or unnecessarily distracting and less rewarding.
Regardless, it helps to be informed and to know as much about the invest-
ing business as possible—if for no other reason than to know all the things
you should avoid. I say don’t make it too complicated; keep it simple.
How Many Stocks Should You Really Own?
How many times have you been told, “Don’t put all your eggs in one bas-
ket”? On the surface, this sounds like good advice, but my experience is that
few people do more than one or two things exceedingly well. Those who are
jacks-of-all-trades and masters of none are rarely dramatically successful in

BE SMART FROM THE START
any field, including investing. Did all the esoteric derivatives help or harm
Wall Street pros? Did experimenting with highly abnormal leverage of 50 or
100 to 1 help or hurt them?
Would you go to a dentist who did a little engineering or cabinetmaking
on the side and who, on weekends, wrote music and worked as an auto
mechanic, plumber, and accountant?
This is true of companies as well as people. The best example of diversi-
fication in the corporate world is the conglomerate. Most large conglomer-
ates do not do well. They’re too big, too inefficient, and too spread out over
too many businesses to focus effectively and grow profitably. Whatever hap-
pened to Jimmy Ling and Ling-Temco-Vought or to Gulf+Western Indus-
tries after the conglomerate craze of the late 1960s collapsed? Big business
and big government in America can both become inefficient, make many
mistakes, and create nearly as many big new problems as they hope to solve.
Do you remember when Mobil Oil diversified into the retail business by
acquiring Montgomery Ward, the struggling national department-store
chain, years ago? It never worked. Neither did Sears, Roebuck’s move into
financial services with the purchases of Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker,
or General Motors’s takeover of computer-services giant EDS, or hundreds
of other corporate diversification attempts. How many different businesses
and types of loans was New York’s Citigroup involved in from 2000 to 2008?
The more you diversify, the less you know about any one area. Many
investors overdiversify. The best results are usually achieved through con-
centration, by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and
watching them very carefully. Did broad diversification protect your portfo-
lio in the 2000 break or in 2008? The more stocks you own, the slower you
may be to react and take selling action to raise sufficient cash when a serious
bear market begins, because of a false sense of security. When major market
tops occur, you should sell, get off margin if you use borrowed money, and
raise at least some cash. Otherwise, you’ll give back most of your gains.
The winning investor’s objective should be to have one or two big winners
rather than dozens of very small profits. It’s much better to have a number
of small losses and a few very big profits. Broad diversification is plainly and
simply often a hedge for ignorance. Did all the banks from 1997 to 2007 that
bought packages containing 5,000 widely diversified different real estate
loans that had the implied backing of the government and were labeled
triple A protect and grow their investments?
Most people with $20,000 to $200,000 to invest should consider limiting
themselves to four or five carefully chosen stocks they know and under-
stand. Once you own five stocks and a tempting situation comes along that
you want to buy, you should muster the discipline to sell your least attractive

Money Management
investment. If you have $5,000 to $20,000 to invest, three stocks might be a
reasonable maximum. A $3,000 account could be confined to two equities.
Keep things manageable. The more stocks you own, the harder it is to keep
track of all of them. Even investors with portfolios of more than a million
dollars need not own more than six or seven well-selected securities. If
you’re uncomfortable and nervous with only six or seven, then own ten. But
owning 30 or 40 could be a problem. The big money is made by concentra-
tion, provided you use sound buy and sell rules along with realistic general
market rules. And there certainly is no rule that says that a 50-stock portfo-
lio can’t go down 50% or more.
How to Spread Your Purchases over Time
It’s possible to spread out your purchases over a period of time. This is an
interesting form of diversifying. When I accumulated a position in Amgen in
1990 and 1991, I bought on numerous days. I spread out the buying and
made add-on buys only when there was a significant gain on earlier buys. If
the market price was 20 points over my average cost and a new buy point
occurred off a proper base, I bought more, but I made sure not to run my
average cost up by buying more than a limited or moderate addition.
However, newcomers should be extremely careful in trying this more
risky, highly concentrated approach. You have to learn how to do it right,
and you positively have to sell or cut back if things don’t work as expected.
In a bull market, one way to maneuver your portfolio toward more con-
centrated positions is to follow up your initial buy and make one or two
smaller additional buys in stocks as soon as they have advanced 2% to 3%
above your initial buy. However, don’t allow yourself to keep chasing a stock
once it’s extended too far past a correct buy point. This will also spare you
the frustration of owning a stock that goes a lot higher but isn’t doing your
portfolio much good because you own fewer shares of it than you do of your
other, less-successful issues. At the same time, sell and eliminate stocks that
start to show losses before they become big losses.
Using this follow-up purchasing procedure should keep more of your
money in just a few of your best stock investments. No system is perfect, but
this one is more realistic than a haphazardly diversified portfolio and has a
better chance of achieving important results. Diversification is definitely
sound; just don’t overdo it. Always set a limit on how many stocks you will
own, and stick to your rules. Always keep your set of rules with you—in a
simple notebook, perhaps—when you’re investing. What? You say you’ve
been investing without any specific buy or sell rules? What results has that
produced for you over the last five or ten years?

BE SMART FROM THE START
Should You Invest for the Long Haul?
If you do decide to concentrate, should you invest for the long haul or trade
more frequently? The answer is that the holding period (long or short) is not
the main issue. What’s critical is buying the right stock—the very best
stock—at precisely the right time, then selling it whenever the market or
your various sell rules tell you it’s time to sell. The time between your buy
and your sell could be either short or long. Let your rules and the market
decide which one it is. If you do this, some of your winners will be held for
three months, some for six months, and a few for one, two, or three years or
more. Most of your losers will be held for much shorter periods, normally
between a few weeks and three months. No well-run portfolio should ever,
ever have losses carried for six months or more. Keep your portfolio clean
and in sync with the market. Remember, good gardeners always weed the
flower patch and prune weak stems.
Lessons for Buy-and-Hold Investors Who Don’t Use Charts
I’ve marked up the weekly charts of WorldCom in 1999, Enron in 2001, and
Citigroup, AIG, and General Motors in 2007. They show 10 to 15 specific
signs that these investments should clearly have been sold at that time.
Why you must always use charts…see what happens next.

BE SMART FROM THE START
Actually, if you looked at a longer time period, there were even more sell
signals. For example, Citigroup had dramatically underperformed on a rel-
ative strength basis for the prior three years, from 2004 through 2006, and
its earnings growth during that time slowed from its growth rate throughout
the 1990s. It pays to monitor your investments’ price and volume activity.
That’s how you stop losing and start winning.
Should You Day Trade?
One type of investing that I have always discouraged people from doing is
day trading, where you buy and sell stocks on the same day. Most investors
lose money doing this. The reason is simple: you are dealing predominantly
with minor daily fluctuations that are harder to read than basic trends over a
longer time period. Besides, there’s generally not enough profit potential in
day trading to offset the commissions you generate and the losses that will
inevitably occur. Don’t try to make money so fast. Rome wasn’t built in a day.
There is a new form of day trading that is more like short-term swing
trading (buying a stock on the upswing and selling before an inevitable pull-
back). It involves buying a stock at its exact pivot buy point off a chart (com-
ing out of a base or price consolidation area) and selling it five or so days
later after the breakout. Sometimes pivot points off patterns such as the
cup-with-handle pattern (see Chapter 2) identified on intraday charts of
five-minute intervals can reveal a stock that is breaking out from an intraday
pattern. If this is done with real skill in a positive market, it might work for
some people, but it requires lots of time, study, and experience.
Should You Use Margin?
In the first year or two, while you’re still learning to invest, it’s much safer to
invest on a cash basis. It usually takes most new investors at least two to three
years before they gain enough market experience (by making several bad
decisions, wasting time trying to reinvent the wheel, and experimenting with
unsound beliefs) to be able to make and keep significant profits. Once you
have a few years’ experience, a sound plan, and a strict set of both buy and
sell rules, you might consider buying on margin (using borrowed money
from your brokerage firm in order to purchase more stock). Generally, mar-
gin buying should be done by younger investors who are still working. Their
risk is somewhat less because they have more time to prepare for retirement.
The best time to use margin is generally during the first two years of a
new bull market. Once you recognize a new bear market, you should get off
margin immediately and raise as much cash as possible. You must under-

stand that when the general market declines and your stocks start sinking,
you will lose your initial capital twice as fast if you’re fully margined than you
would if you were invested on a cash basis. This dictates that you absolutely
mustcut all losses quickly and get off margin when a major general market
deterioration begins. If you speculate in small-capitalization or high-tech
stocks fully margined, a 50% correction can cause a total loss. This hap-
pened to some new investors in 2000 and early 2001.
You don’t have to be fully margined all the time. Sometimes you’ll have
large cash reserves and no margin. At other times, you’ll be invested on a
cash basis. At still other points, you’ll be using a small part of your margin
buying power. And in a few instances, when you’re making genuine progress
in a bull market, you may be fully invested on margin. All of this depends on
the current market situation and your level of experience. I’ve always used
margin, and I believe it offers a real advantage to an experienced investor
who knows how to confine his buying to high-quality market leaders and has
the discipline and common sense to always cut his losses short with no
exceptions.
Your margin interest expense, depending on laws that change constantly,
might be tax-deductible. However, in certain periods, margin interest rates
can become so high that the probability of substantial success may be lim-
ited. To buy on margin, you’ll also need to sign a margin agreement with
your broker.
Never Answer a Margin Call
If a stock in your margin account collapses in value to the point where your
stockbroker asks you to either put up money or sell stock, don’t put up
money; think about selling stock. Nine times out of ten, you’ll be better off.
The marketplace is telling you that you’re on the wrong path, you’re getting
hurt, and things aren’t working. So sell and cut back your risk level. Again,
why throw good money after bad? What will you do if you put up good
money and the stock continues to decline and you get more margin calls?
Go broke backing a loser?
Should You Sell Short?
I did some research and wrote a booklet on short selling in 1976. It’s now
out of print, but not much has changed on the subject since then. In 2005,
the booklet was the basis for a book titled How to Make Money Selling
Short. The book was written with Gil Morales, who rewrote, revised, and
updated my earlier work. Short selling is still a topic few investors under-
stand and an endeavor at which even fewer succeed, so consider carefully

whether it’s right for you. More active and seasoned investors might con-
sider limited short selling. But I would want to keep the limit to 10% or 15%
of available money, and most people probably shouldn’t do even that much.
Furthermore, short selling is far more complicated than simply buying
stocks, and most short sellers are run in and lose money.
What is short selling? Think of it as reversing the normal buy and sell
process. In short selling, you sell a stock (instead of buying it)—even though
you don’t own it and therefore must borrow it from your broker—in the
hope that it will go down in price instead of up. If the stock falls in price as
you expect, you can “cover your short position” by buying the stock in the
open market at a lower price and pocket the difference as your profit. You
would sell short if you think the market is going to drop substantially or a
certain stock is ready to cave in. You sell the stock first, hoping to buy it back
later at a lower price.
Sounds easy, right? Wrong. Short selling rarely works out well. Usually the
stock that you sell short, expecting a colossal price decrease, will do the unex-
pected and begin to creep up in price. When it goes up, you lose money.
Effective short selling is usually done at the beginning of a new general
market decline. This means you have to short based on the behavior of the
daily market averages. This, in turn, requires the ability to (1) interpret the
daily Dow, S&P 500, or Nasdaq indexes, as discussed in Chapter 9, and (2)
select stocks that have had tremendous run-ups and have definitely topped
out months earlier. In other words, your timing has to be flawless. You may
be right, but if you’re too early, you can be forced to cover at a loss.
In selling short, you also have to minimize your risk by cutting your losses
at 8%. Otherwise, the sky’s the limit, as your stock could have an unlimited
price increase.
My first rule in short selling: don’t sell short during a bull market. Why
fight the overall tide? But sooner or later you may disregard the advice in this
book, try it for yourself, and find out the same hard way—just as you learn
that “wet paint” signs usually mean what they say. In general, you should save
the short selling for bear markets. Your odds will be a little better.
The second rule is: never sell short a stock with a small number of shares
outstanding. It’s too easy for market makers and professionals to run up a
thinly capitalized stock on you. This is called a “short squeeze” (meaning
you could find yourself with a loss and be forced to cover by buying the
stock back at a higher price), and when you’re in one, it doesn’t feel very
good. It’s safer to short stocks that are trading an average daily volume of 5
to 10 million shares or more.
The two best chart price patterns for selling short are shown on the two
graphs on page 288.

1. The “head-and-shoulders” top. The “right shoulder” of the price pattern
on the stock chart mustbe slightly lower than the left. The correct time
to short is when the third or fourth pullback up in price during the right
shoulder is about over. (Note the four upward pullbacks in the right
shoulder of the Lucent Technologies head-and-shoulders top.) One of
these upward price pullbacks will reach slightly above the peak of a rally
a few weeks back. This serves to run in the premature short sellers. For-
mer big market leaders that have broken badly can have several upward
price pullbacks of 20% to 40% from the stock’s low point in the right
shoulder. The stock’s last run-up should cross over its moving average
line. The right time to short is when the volume picks up as the stock
reverses lower and breaks below its 10-week moving average line on vol-
ume but hasn’t yet broken to new low ground, at which point it is too late
and then becomes too obvious and apparent to most traders. In some,
but not all, cases, either there will be a deceleration in quarterly earnings
growth or earnings will have actually turned down. The stock’s relative
strength line should also be in a clear downtrend for at least 20 weeks up
to 34 weeks. In fact, we found through research on model stocks over 50
years that almost all outstanding short-selling patterns occurred five to
seven months after a formerly huge market leader has clearly topped.
John Wooden, the great UCLA basketball coach, used to tell his play-
ers, “It’s what you learn after you know it all that counts.” Well, one
know-it-all investor wrote and told us that we obviously didn’t know what
we were talking about, that no knowledgeable person would ever sell a
stock short seven months after it had topped. Few people understand
this, and most short sellers lose money because of premature, faulty, or
overly obvious timing. Lucent at point 4 was in its eighth month and fell
89%. Yahoo! was in its eighth month after it had clearly topped, and it
then fell 87%. Big egos in the stock market are very dangerous . . .
because they lead you to think you know what you’re doing. The smarter
you are, the more losses ego can create. Humility and respect for the
market are more valuable traits.
2. Third- or fourth-stage cup-with-handle or other patterns that have defi-
nitely failed after attempted breakouts. The stock should be picking up
trading volume and starting to break down below the “handle” area. (See
Chapter 2 on chart reading and failed breakouts.)
For years, short selling had to be executed on an “uptick” from the previ-
ous trade. An uptick is any trade that is higher than the previous trade by at
least a penny. (It used to be 1⁄ or ¼ point or more up.) Therefore, orders
8
should normally be entered either at the market or at a maximum, with a

limit of $0.25 or so below the last price. A weak stock could trade down a
point or more without having an uptick.
After a careful study, the SEC recently rescinded the uptick rule. It
should and probably will be reinstated at some point, with more than a penny
price increase being required—perhaps a 10- or 20-cent rally. This should
reduce volatility in some equities, especially in bad, panicky markets. The
uptick rule was originally created in early 1937 after the market had broken
seriously in the prior year. Its purpose was to require a 1⁄ or ¼ of 1 point
8
uptick, which would be 12½ or 25 cents, to slow down the uninterrupted
hammering that a stock would be subject to during severe market breaks.
One alternative to selling short is buying put options, which don’t need an
uptick to receive an executed trade. You could also short tracking indexes
like the QQQs (Nasdaq 100), SMHs (semiconductors), or BBHs (biotech).
These also do not require an uptick.

Shorting must be done in a margin account, so check with your broker to
see if you can borrow the stock you want to sell short. Also, if the stock pays
a dividend while you are short, you’ll have to pay the dividend to the person
who owned the stock you borrowed and sold. Lesson: don’t short big divi-
dend-paying stocks.
Short selling is treacherous even for professionals, and only the more able
and daring should give it a try. One last warning: don’t short an advancing
stock just because its price or the P/E ratio seems too high. You could be
taken to the cleaners.
What Are Options, and Should You Invest in Them?
Options are an investment vehicle where you purchase rights (contracts) to
buy (“call”) or sell (“put”) a stock, stock index, or commodity at a specified
price before a specified future time, known as the option expiration date.
Options are very speculative and involve substantially greater risks and price
volatility than common stocks. Therefore, most investors should not buy or
sell options. Winning investors should first learn how to minimize the
investment risks they take, not increase them. After a person has proved
that she is able to make money in common stocks and has sufficient invest-
ment understanding and actual experience, then the limited use of options
could be intelligently considered.
Options are like making “all or nothing” bets. If you buy a three-month
call option on McDonald’s, the premium you pay gives you the right to pur-
chase 100 shares of MCD at a certain price at any time during the next three
months. When you purchase calls, you expect the price of the stock to go up,
so if a stock is currently trading at $120, you might buy a call at $125. If the
stock rises to $150 after three months (and you have not sold your call
option), you can exercise it and pocket the $25 profit less the premium you
paid. Conversely, if three months go by and your stock is down and didn’t
perform as expected, you would not exercise the option; it expires worthless,
and you lose the premium you paid. As you might expect, puts are handled
in a similar manner, except that you’re making a bet that the price of the
stock will decrease instead of increase.
Limiting Your Risk when It Comes to Options
If you do consider options, you should definitely limit the percentage of
your total portfolio committed to them. A prudent limit might be no more
than 10% to 15%. You should also adopt a rule about where you intend to
cut and limit all of your losses. The percentage will naturally have to be
more than 8%, since options are much more volatile than stocks. If an

BE SMART FROM THE START
option fluctuates three times as rapidly as the underlying stock, then per-
haps 20% or 25% might be a possible absolute limit. On the profit side, you
might consider adopting a rule that you’ll take many of your gains when they
hit 50% to 75%.
Some aspects of options present challenges. Buying options whose price
can be significantly influenced by supply and demand changes as a result of
a thin or illiquid market for that particular option is problematic. Also prob-
lematic is the fact that options can be artificially and temporarily overpriced
simply because of a short-lived increase in price volatility in the underlying
stock or the general market.
Buy Only the Best
When I buy options, which is rarely, I prefer to buy them for the most
aggressive and outstanding stocks with the biggest earnings estimates, those
where the premium you have to pay for the option is higher. Once again,
you want options on the best stocks, not the cheapest. The secret to making
money in options doesn’t have much to do with options. You have to analyze
and be right on the selection and timing of the underlying stock. Therefore,
you should apply your CAN SLIM system and select the best possible stock
at the best possible time.
If you do this and you are right, the option will go up along with the stock,
except that the option should move up much faster because of the leverage.
By buying only options on the best stocks, you also minimize slippage
caused by illiquidity. (Slippage is the difference between the price you
wanted to pay and the price you actually paid at the time the order was exe-
cuted. The more liquid the stock, the less slippage you should experience.)
With illiquid (small-capitalization) stocks, the slippage can be more severe,
and this ultimately could cost you money. Buying options on lower-priced,
illiquid stocks is similar to the carnival game where you’re trying to knock
down all the milk bottles. The game may be rigged. Selling your options can
be equally tricky in a thin (small-capitalization) stock.
In a major bear market, you might consider buying put options on certain
individual stocks or on a major stock index like the S&P, along with selling
shares of common stock short. The inability of your broker to borrow a stock
may make selling short more difficult than buying a put. It is generally not
wise to buy puts during a bull market. Why be a fish trying to swim
upstream?
If you think a stock is going up and it’s the right time to buy, then buy it,
or purchase a long-term option and place your order at the market. If it’s
time to sell, sell at the market. Option markets are usually thinner and not
as liquid as the markets for the underlying stock itself.

Many amateur option traders constantly place price limits on their
orders. Once they get into the habit of placing limits, they are forever
changing their price restraints as prices edge away from their limits. It is dif-
ficult to maintain sound judgment and perspective when you are worrying
about changing your limits. In the end, you’ll get some executions after
tremendous excess effort and frustration.
When you finally pick the big winner for the year, the one that will triple
in price, you’ll lose out because you placed your order with a ¼-point limit
below the actual market price. You never make big money in the stock mar-
ket by eighths and quarters.
You could also lose your shirt if your security is in trouble and you fail to
sell and get out because you put a price limit on your sell order. Your objec-
tive is to be right on the big moves, not on the minor fluctuations.
Short-Term Options Are More Risky
If you buy options, you’re better off with longer time periods, say, six
months or so. This will minimize the chance your option will run out of time
before your stock has had a chance to perform. Now that I’ve told you this,
what do you think most investors do? Of course, they buy shorter-term
option—30 to 90 days—because these options are cheaper and move faster
in both directions, up and down!
The problem with short-term options is that you could be right on your
stock, but the general market may slip into an intermediate correction, with
the result that all stocks are down at the end of the short time period. You
will then lose on all your options because of the general market. This is also
why you should spread your option buying and option expiration dates over
several different months.
Keep Option Trading Simple
One thing to keep in mind is that you should always keep your investments
as simple as possible. Don’t let someone talk you into speculating in such
seemingly sophisticated packages as strips, straddles, and spreads.
Astripis a form of conventional option that couples one call and two puts
on the same security at the same exercise price with the same expiration
date. The premium is less than it would be if the options were purchased
separately.
Astraddlecan be either long or short. A long straddle is a long call and a long
put on the same underlying security at the same exercise price and with the
same expiration month. A short straddle is a short call and a short put on the
same security at the same exercise price and with the same expiration month.
Aspreadis a purchase and sale of options with the same expiration dates.

BE SMART FROM THE START
It’s difficult enough to just pick a stock or an option that is going up. If you
confuse the issue and start hedging (being both long and short at the same
time), you could, believe it or not, wind up losing on both sides. For
instance, if a stock goes up, you might be tempted to sell your put early to
minimize the loss, and later find that the stock has turned downward and
you’re losing money on your call. The reverse could also happen. It’s a dan-
gerous psychological game that you should avoid.
Should You Write Options?
Writing options is a completely different story from buying options. I am not
overly impressed with the strategy of writing options on stocks.
A person who writes a call option receives a small fee or premium in
return for giving someone else (the buyer) the right to “call” away and buy
the stock from the writer at a specified price, up to a certain date. In a bull
market, I would rather be a buyer of calls than a writer (seller) of calls. In
bad markets, just stay out or go short.
The writer of calls pockets a small fee and is, in effect, usually locked in
for the time period of the call. What if the stock you own and wrote the call
against gets into trouble and plummets? The small fee won’t cover your loss.
Of course, there are maneuvers the writer can take, such as buying a put to
hedge and cover himself, but then situation gets too complicated and the
writer could get whipsawed back and forth.
What happens if the stock doubles? The writer gets the stock called away,
and for a relatively small fee loses all chance for a major profit. Why take
risks in stocks for only meager gains with no chance for large gains? This is
not the reasoning you will hear from most people, but then again, what most
people are saying and doing in the stock market isn’t usually worth knowing.
Writing “naked calls” is even more foolish, in my opinion. Naked call writ-
ers receive a fee for writing a call on a stock they do not own, so they are
unprotected if the stock moves against them.
It’s possible that large investors who have trouble making decent returns
on their portfolio may find some minor added value in writing short-term
options on stocks that they own and feel are overpriced. However, I am
always somewhat skeptical of new methods of making money that seem so
easy. There are few free lunches in the stock market or in real estate.
Great Opportunities in Nasdaq Stocks
Nasdaq stocks are not traded on a listed stock exchange, but instead are
traded through over-the-counter dealers. The over-the-counter dealer mar-
ket has been enhanced in recent years by a wide range of ECNs (electronic

communication networks), such as Instinet, SelectNet, Redibook, and
Archipelago, which bring buyers and sellers together within each network,
and through which orders can be routed and executed. The Nasdaq is a spe-
cialized field, and in many cases the stocks traded are those of newer, less-
established companies. But now even NYSE firms have large Nasdaq
operations. In addition, reforms during the 1990s have removed any linger-
ing stigma that once dogged the Nasdaq.
There are usually hundreds of intriguing new growth stocks on the Nas-
daq. It’s also the home of some of the biggest companies in the United
States. You should definitely consider buying better-quality Nasdaq stocks
that have institutional sponsorship and fit the CAN SLIM rules.
For maximum flexibility and safety, it’s vital that you maintain mar-
ketability in all your investments, regardless of whether they’re traded on
the NYSE or on the Nasdaq. An institutional-quality common stock with
larger average daily volume is one defense against an unruly market.
Should You Buy Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)?
An initial public offering is a company’s first offering of stock to the public.
I usually don’t recommend that investors purchase IPOs. There are several
reasons for this.
Among the numerous IPOs that occur each year, there are a few out-
standing ones. However, those that are outstanding are going to be in such
hot demand by institutions (who get first crack at them) that if you are able
to buy them at all, you may receive only a tiny allotment. Logic dictates that
if you, as an individual investor, can acquire all the shares you want, they are
possibly not worth having.
The Internet and some discount brokerages have made IPOs more acces-
sible to individual investors, although some brokers place limits on your
ability to sell soon after a company comes public. This is a dangerous posi-
tion to be in, since you may not be able to get out when you want to. You
may recall that during the IPO craze of 1999 and early 2000, there were
some new stocks that rocketed on their first day or two of trading, only to
collapse and never recover.
Many IPOs are deliberately underpriced and therefore shoot up on the
first day of trading, but more than a few could be overpriced and drop.
Because IPOs have no trading history, you can’t be sure whether they’re
overpriced. In most cases, this speculative area should be left to experi-
enced institutional investors who have access to the necessary in-depth
research and who are able to spread their new issue risks among many dif-
ferent equities.

This is not to say that you can’t purchase a new issue after the IPO when
the stock is up in its infancy. Google should have been bought in mid-Sep-
tember 2004, in the fifth week after its new issue, when it made a new high
at 114. The safest time to buy an IPO is on the breakout from its first cor-
rection and base-building area. Once a new issue has been trading in the
market for one, two, or three months or more, you have valuable price and
volume data that you can use to better judge the situation.
Within the broad list of new issues of the previous three months to three
years, there are always standout companies with superior new products and
excellent current and recent quarterly earnings and sales that you should
consider. (Investor’s Business Daily’s “The New America” page explores
most of them. Past articles on a company may be available.) CB Richard
Ellis formed a perfect flat base after its IPO in the summer of 2004 and
then rose 500%.
Experienced investors who understand correct selection and timing tech-
niques should definitely consider buying new issues that show good positive
earnings and exceptional sales growth, and also have formed sound price
bases. They can be a great source of new ideas if they are dealt with in this
fashion. Most big stock winners in recent years had an IPO at some point in
the prior one to eight or ten years. Even so, new issues can be more volatile
and occasionally suffer massive corrections during difficult bear markets.
This usually happens after a period of wild excess in the IPO market, where
any and every offering seems to be a “hot issue.” For example, the new issue
booms that developed in the early 1960s and the beginning of 1983, as well
as that in late 1999 and early 2000, were almost always followed by a bear
market period.
Congress, at this writing in early 2009, should consider lowering the cap-
ital gains tax to create a powerful incentive for thousands of new entrepre-
neurs to start up innovative new companies. Our historical research proved
that 80% of the stocks that had outstanding price performance and job cre-
ation in the 1980s and 1990s had been brought public in the prior eight to
ten years, as mentioned earlier. America now badly needs a renewed flow of
new companies to spark new inventions and new industries . . . and a
stronger economy, millions more jobs, and millions more taxpayers. It has
always paid for Washington to lower capital gains taxes. This will be needed
to reignite the IPO market and the American economy after the economic
collapse that the subprime real estate program and the credit crisis caused
in 2008. I learned many years ago that if rates are raised, many investors will
simply not sell their stock because they don’t want to pay the tax and then
have significantly less money to reinvest. Washington can’t seem to under-
stand this simple fact. Fewer people will sell their stocks, and the govern-

ment will always get less revenue, not more. I’ve had many older, retired
people tell me they will keep their stock until they die so they won’t have to
pay the tax.
What Are Convertible Bonds, and Should You Invest in Them?
A convertible bond is one that you can exchange (convert) for another
investment category, typically common stock, at a predetermined price.
Convertible bonds provide a little higher income to the owner than the
common stock typically does, along with the potential for some possible
profits.
The theory goes that a convertible bond will rise almost as fast as the
common stock rises, but will decline less during downturns. As so often hap-
pens with theories, the reality can be different. There is also a liquidity
question to consider, since convertible bond markets may dry up during
extremely difficult periods.
Sometimes investors are attracted to this medium because they can bor-
row heavily and leverage their commitment (obtain more buying power).
This simply increases your risk. Excessive leverage can be dangerous, as
Wall Street and Washington learned in 2008.
It is for these several reasons that I do not recommend that most
investors buy convertible bonds. I have also never bought a corporate bond.
They are poor inflation hedges, and, ironically, you can also lose a lot of
money in the bond market if you make what ultimately turns out to be a
higher-risk investment in stretching for a higher yield.
Should You Invest in Tax-Free Securities and Tax Shelters?
The typical investor should not use these investment vehicles (IRAs, 401(k)
plans, and Keoghs excepted), the most common of which are municipal
bonds. Overconcern about taxes can confuse and cloud investors’ normally
sound judgment. Common sense should also tell you that if you invest in tax
shelters, there is a much greater chance the IRS may decide to audit your
tax return.
Don’t kid yourself. You can lose money in munis if you buy them at the
wrong time or if the local or state government makes bad management deci-
sions and gets into real financial trouble, which some of them have done in
the past.
People who seek too many tax benefits or tax dodges frequently end up
investing in questionable or risky ventures. The investment decision should
always be considered first, with tax considerations a distant second.

BE SMART FROM THE START
This is America, where anyone who really works at it can become suc-
cessful at saving and investing. Learn how to make a net profit and, when
you do, be happy about it rather than complaining about having to pay taxes
because you made a profit. Would you rather hold on until you have a loss
so you have no tax to pay? Recognize at the start that Uncle Sam will always
be your partner, and he will receive his normal share of your wages and
investment gains.
I have never bought a tax-free security or a tax shelter. This has left me
free to concentrate on finding the best investments possible. When these
investments work out, I pay my taxes just like everybody else. Always
remember . . . the U.S. system of freedom and opportunity is the greatest in
the world. Learn to use, protect, and appreciate it.
Should You Invest in Income Stocks?
Income stocks are stocks that have high and regular dividend yields, providing
taxable income to the owner. These stocks are typically found in supposedly
more conservative industries, such as utilities and banks. Most people should
not buy common stocks for their dividends or income, yet many people do.
People think that income stocks are conservative and that you can just sit
and hold them because you are getting your dividends. Talk to any investor
who lost big on Continental Illinois Bank in 1984 when the stock plunged
from $25 to $2, or on Bank of America when it crashed from $55 to $5 as of
the beginning of 2009, or on the electric utilities caught up in the past with
nuclear power plants. (Ironically, 17 major nationsnow get or for years have
gotten more of their electricity from nuclear power plants than the United
States does. France gets 78% of its electricity from nuclear power.)
Investors also got hurt when electric utilities nosedived in 1994, and the
same was true when certain California utilities collapsed in 2001. In theory,
income stocks should be safer, but don’t be lulled into believing that
they can’t decline sharply. In 1999–2000, AT&T dropped from over $60 to
below $20.
And how about the aforementioned Citigroup, the New York City bank
that so many institutional investors owned? I don’t care how much it paid in
dividends; if you owned Citigroup at $50 and watched it nosedive to $2,
when it was in the process of going bankrupt until the government bailed it
out, you lost an enormous amount of money. Incidentally, even if you do
invest in income stocks, you should use charts. In October of 2007, Citigroup
stock broke wide open on the largest volume month that it ever traded, so
that even an amateur chartist could have recognized this and easily sold it in
the $40s, avoiding a serious loss.

If you do buy income stocks, never strain to buy the highest dividend
yield available. That will typically entail much greater risk and lower quality.
Trying to get an extra 2% or 3% yield can significantly expose your capital to
larger losses. That’s what a lot of Wall Street firms did in the real estate bub-
ble, and look what happened to their investments. A company can also cut
its dividends if its earnings per share are not adequately covering those pay-
outs, leaving you without the income you expected to receive. This too has
happened.
If you need income, my advice is to concentrate on the very best-quality
stocks and simply withdraw 6% of your investments each year for living
expenses. You could sell off a few shares and withdraw 11⁄% per quarter.
2
Higher rates of withdrawal are not usually advisable, since in time they
might lead to some depletion of your principal.
What Are Warrants, and Are They Safe Investments?
Warrants are an investment vehicle that allows you to purchase a specific
amount of stock at a specific price. Sometimes warrants are good for a cer-
tain period of time, but it’s common for them not to have time limits. Many
of them are cheap in price and therefore seem appealing.
However, most investors should shy away from low-priced warrants. This
is another complex, specialized field that sounds fine in concept but that few
investors truly understand. The real question comes down to whether the
common stock is correct to buy. Most investors will be better off if they for-
get the field of warrants.
Should You Invest in Merger Candidates?
Merger candidates can often behave erratically, so I don’t recommend
investing in them. Some merger candidates run up substantially in price on
rumors of a possible sale, only to have the price drop suddenly when a
potential deal falls through or other unforeseen circumstances occur. In
other words, this can be a risky, volatile business, and it should generally be
left to experienced professionals who specialize in this field. It is usually bet-
ter to buy sound companies, based on your basic CAN SLIM evaluation,
than to try to guess whether a company will be sold or merged with another.
Should You Buy Foreign Stocks?
A few foreign stocks have excellent potential if they are bought at the right
time and the right place, but I don’t suggest that people spend too much

time getting substantially invested in them. The potential profit from a for-
eign stock should be a good bit more than that from a standout U.S. com-
pany to justify the potential additional risk. For example, investors in foreign
securities must understand and closely follow the general market of the par-
ticular country involved. Sudden changes in that country’s interest rates,
currency, or government policy could, through one unexpected action,
make your investment less attractive.
It isn’t necessary for you to search out a lot of foreign stocks when there
are more than 10,000 securities to select from in the United States. Many
worthy foreign stocks also trade in the United States, and a number had
excellent success in the past, including Research in Motion, China Mobile,
and America Movil. I owned two of them in the last bull market. All of these
stocks benefited from the worldwide wireless boom, but corrected 60% or
more in the bear market that followed this bull move. There are also some
mutual funds that excel in foreign securities.
As weak as our stock market was in 2008, many foreign markets declined
even more. Baidu, a Chinese stock leader, dropped from $429 to $100. And
the Russian market plummeted straight down from 16,291 to 3,237 once
Putin invaded and intimidated the nation of Georgia.
Avoid Penny Stocks and Low-Priced Securities
The Canadian and Denver markets list many stocks that you can buy for
only a few cents a share. I strongly advise that you avoid gambling in such
cheap merchandise, because everything sells for what it’s worth. You get
what you pay for.
These seemingly cheap securities are unduly speculative and extremely
low in quality. The risk is much higher with them than with better-quality,
higher-priced investments. The opportunity for questionable or unscrupu-
lous promotional practices is also greater with penny stocks. I prefer not to
buy any common stock that sells for below $15 per share, and so should you.
Our extensive historical studies of 125 years of America’s super winners show
that most of them broke out of chart bases between $30 and $50 a share.
What Are Futures, and Should You Invest in Them?
Futures involve buying or selling a specific amount of a commodity, finan-
cial issue, or stock index at a specific price on a specific future date. Most
futures fall into the categories of grains, precious metals, industrial metals,
foods, meats, oils, woods, and fibers (known collectively as commodities);
financial issues; and stock indexes. The financial group includes government

T-bills and bonds, plus foreign currencies. One of the more active stock
indexes traded is the S&P 100, better known by its ticker symbol OEX.
Large commercial concerns, such as Hershey, use the commodity market
for “hedging.” For example, Hershey might lock in a current price by tem-
porarily purchasing cocoa beans in May for December delivery, while
arranging for a deal in the cash market.
It is probably best for most individual investors not to participate in the
futures markets. Commodity futures are extremely volatile and much more
speculative than most common stocks. It is not an arena for the inexperi-
enced or small investor unless you want to gamble or lose money quickly.
However, once an investor has four or five years of experience and has
unquestionably proven her ability to make money in common stocks, if she
is strong of heart, she might consider investing in futures on a limited basis.
With futures, it is even more important that you be able to read and inter-
pret charts. The chart price patterns in commodity prices are similar to
those in individual stocks. Being aware of futures charts can also help stock
investors evaluate changes in basic economic conditions in the country.
There are a relatively small number of futures that you can trade. There-
fore, astute speculators can concentrate their analysis. The rules and termi-
nology of futures trading are different, and the risk is far greater, so investors
should definitely limit the proportion of their investment funds that they
commit to futures. There are worrisome events involved in futures trading,
such as “limit down” days, where a trader is not allowed to sell and cut a loss.
Risk management (i.e., position size and cutting losses quickly) is never more
important than when trading futures. You should also never risk more than
5% of your capital in any one futures position. There is an outside chance of
getting stuck in a position that has a series of limit up or limit down days.
Futures can be treacherous and devastating; you could definitely lose it all.
I have never bought commodity futures. I do not believe you can be a
jack-of-all-trades. Learn just one field as completely as possible. There are
thousands of stocks to choose from.
Should You Buy Gold, Silver, or Diamonds?
As you might surmise, I do not normally recommend investing in metals or
precious stones.
Many of these investments have erratic histories. They were once pro-
moted in an extremely aggressive fashion, with little protection afforded to
the small investor. In addition, the dealer’s profit markup on these invest-
ments may be excessive. Furthermore, these investments do not pay inter-
est or dividends.

There will always be periodic, significant run-ups in gold stocks caused by
fears or panics brought about by potential problems in certain foreign coun-
tries. A few gold companies may also be in their own cycle, like Barrick Gold
was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This type of commodity-oriented trad-
ing can be an emotional and unstable game, so I suggest care and caution.
Small investments in such equities, however, can be timely and reasonable
at certain points.
Should You Invest in Real Estate?
Yes, at the right time and in the right place. I am convinced that most peo-
ple should work toward being able to own a home by building a savings
account and investing in common stocks or a growth-stock mutual fund.
Home ownership has been a goal for most Americans. The ability over the
years to obtain long-term borrowed money with only a small or reasonable
down payment has created the leverage necessary to eventually make real
estate investments possible for most Americans.
Real estate is a popular investment vehicle because it is fairly easy to under-
stand and in certain areas can be highly profitable. About two-thirds of Amer-
ican families currently own their own homes. Time and leverage usually pay
off. However, this is not always the case. People can and do lose money in real
estate under many of the following realistic unfavorable conditions:
1. They make a poor initial selection by buying in an area that is slowly
deteriorating or is not growing, or the area in which they’ve owned prop-
erty for some time deteriorates.
2. They buy at inflated prices after several boom years and just before
severe setbacks in the economy or in the particular geographic area in
which they own real estate. This might occur if there are major industry
layoffs or if an aircraft, auto, or steel plant that is an important mainstay
of a local community closes.
3. They get themselves personally overextended, with real estate payments
and other debts that are beyond their means, or they get into inviting but
unwise variable-rate loans that could create difficult problems later, or
they take out and live off of home equity—borrowing, rather than paying
down their mortgage over time.
4. Their source of income is suddenly reduced by the loss of a job, or by an
increase in rental vacancies should they own rental property.
5. They are hit by fires, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, or other acts of
nature.

People can also be hurt by well-meaning government policies and social
programs that were not soundly thought through before being imple-
mented, promoted, managed, operated, and overseen by the government.
The subprime fiasco from 1995 to 2008 was caused by a good, well-intended
government program that over time got completely out of control, with
totally unexpected consequences that caused many of the very people the
government hoped to help to lose their homes. It also caused huge job
losses as business contracted. In the greater Los Angeles area alone, many
minority owners in San Bernardino, Riverside, and Santa Ana were dramat-
ically hurt by foreclosures.
Basically, no one should ever buy a home unless he can come up with a
down payment of at least 5%, 10%, or 20% on his own and has a relatively
secure job. You need to earn and save toward your home-buying goal. And
avoid variable-rate loans and smooth-talking salespeople who talk you into
buying homes to “flip,” which exposes you to far more risk. And finally, don’t
take out home equity loans that can put your home in a greater risk position.
Also beware of getting into the terrible habit of using credit cards to run up
big debts. That’s a bad habit that will hurt you for years.
You can make money and develop skill by learning about and concentrat-
ing on the correct buying and selling of high-quality growth-oriented equi-
ties rather than scattering your efforts among the myriad high-risk
investment alternatives. As with all investments, do the necessary research
before you make your decision. Remember, there’s no such thing as a risk-
free investment. Don’t let anyone tell you there is. If something sounds too
easy and good to be true, watch out!
To summarize so far, diversification is good, but don’t overdiversify. Concen-
trate on a smaller list of well-selected stocks, and let the market help you deter-
mine how long each of them should be held. Using margin may be okay if you’re
experienced, but it involves significant extra risk. Don’t sell short unless you
know exactly what you’re doing. Be sure to learn to use charts to help with your
selection and timing. Nasdaq is a good market for newer entrepreneurial com-
panies, but options and futures have considerable risk and should be used only
if you’re very experienced, and then they should be limited to a small percentage
of your overall investments. Also be careful when investing in tax shelters and
foreign stocks.
It’s best to keep your investing simple and basic—high-quality, growth-oriented
stocks, mutual funds, or real estate. But each is a specialty, and you need to edu-
cate yourself so that you’re not dependent solely on someone else for sound
advice and investments.

Twenty-One Costly Common
Mistakes Most Investors Make
Knute Rockne, the famous winning Notre Dame football coach, used to say,
“Build up your weaknesses until they become your strong points.” The rea-
son people either lose money or achieve mediocre results in the stock mar-
ket is they simply make too many mistakes. It’s the same in your business,
your life, or your career. You’re held back or have reverses not because of
your strengths, but because of your mistakes or weaknesses that you do not
recognize and correct. Most people just blame somebody else. It is much
easier to have excuses and alibis than it is to examine your own behavior
realistically.
When I first wrote this book, I came across lots of people who were advis-
ing: “Concentrate on your strengths, not your weaknesses.” That sounded
logical and reasonable in many situations. But now, after 50 years of day-to-
day experience in America’s amazing stock market, where every cycle
thrusts forward dozens of brand-new, innovative, entrepreneurial compa-
nies that keep building our nation, I can state this:
By far the greatest mistake that 98% of all investors make is never spend-
ing any real time trying to learn where they made their mistakes in buying
and selling stock and therefore what they must stop doing and start doing in
order to become highly successful. In other words, you must unlearn many
things you thought you knew that ain’t so, stop doing them, and start learn-
ing new and better rules and methods to use in the future.
The difference between successful people in any field and those who are
not so successful is that the successful person will work and do what others
are unwilling to do. Since the early 1960s, I have known or dealt with count-

Twenty-One Costly Common Mistakes Most Investors Make
less individual risk takers, from inexperienced beginners to smart profes-
sionals. What I’ve discovered is that it doesn’t matter whether you’re just
getting started or have many years, even decades, of investing experience.
The fact is, experience is harmful if it continuously reinforces your bad
habits. Success in the market is achieved by avoiding the classic mistakes
most investors, whether public or professional, make.
Events in recent years should tell you it’s time for you to educate yourself,
take charge and learn how to handle and take responsibility for your own
financial future: your 401(k), your mutual funds, and your stock portfolio.
These events include Bernie Madoff’s theft of billions from supposedly
intelligent people through his supersecretive operations, which were never
transparent, as he never told anyone how he was investing their money; the
public’s heavy losses from the topping stock markets of 2000 and 2008; and
the use of excess leverage by Wall Street firms that couldn’t even manage
their own money with prudence and intelligence, forcing them into bank-
ruptcy or shotgun weddings.
You can learn to do this. Many people have learned how to use sound
rules and principles to protect and secure their financial affairs. Here are
the key mistakes you’ll need to avoid once you get serious and want better
investment results:
1. Stubbornly holding onto your losses when they are very small
and reasonable. Most investors could get out cheaply, but because they
are human, their emotions take over. You don’t want to take a loss, so you
wait and you hope, until your loss gets so large it costs you dearly. This is by
far one of the greatest mistakes nearly all investors make; they don’t under-
stand that all common stocks can be highly speculative and can involve large
risks. Without exception, you should cut every single loss short. The rule I
have taught in classes all across the nation for 45 years is to always cut all
your losses immediately when a stock falls 7% or 8% below your purchase
price. Following this simple rule will ensure you will survive another day to
invest and capitalize on the many excellent opportunities in the future.
2. Buying on the way down in price, thus ensuring miserable
results.A declining stock seems like a real bargain because it’s cheaper than
it was a few months earlier. In late 1999, a young woman I know bought
Xerox when it dropped abruptly to a new low at $34 and seemed really
cheap. A year later, it traded at $6. Why try to catch a falling dagger? Many
people did the same thing in 2000, buying Cisco Systems at $50 on the way
down after it had been $82. It never saw $50 again, even in the 2003 to 2007
bull market. In January 2009, you could buy it for $16.
3. Averaging down in price rather than averaging up when buy-
ing. If you buy a stock at $40, then buy more at $30 and average out your



==================================================

==================================================

304
BE SMART FROM THE START
cost at $35, you are following up your losers and throwing good money after
bad. This amateur strategy can produce serious losses and weigh down your
portfolio with a few big losers.
4. Not learning to use charts and being afraid to buy stocks that
are going into new high ground off sound bases.The public generally
thinks that a stock making a new high price seems too high, but personal
feelings and opinions are emotional and far less accurate than the market
itself. The best time to buy a stock during any bull market is when the stock
initially emerges from a price consolidation or sound “basing” area of at least
seven or eight weeks. Get over wanting to buy something cheap on the way
down.
5. Never getting out of the starting gate properly because of poor
selection criteria and not knowing exactly what to look for in a suc-
cessful company. You need to understand what fundamental factors are
crucial and what are simply not that important! Many investors buy fourth-
rate, “nothing-to-write-home-about” stocks that are not acting particularly
well; have questionable earnings, sales growth, and return on equity; and
are not the true market leaders. Others overly concentrate in highly specu-
lative or lower-quality, risky technology securities.
6. Not having specific general market rules to tell when a correc-
tion in the market is beginning or when a market decline is most
likely over and a new uptrend is confirmed.It’s critical that you be able
to recognize market tops and major market turnarounds coming off the bot-
tom if you want to protect your account from excessive giveback of profits
and significant losses. Likewise, you must know when the storm is over and
the market tells you to buy back in and raise your market commitments. You
can’t go by your opinions or feelings. You must have specific rules and fol-
low them religiously.
7. Not following your buy and sell rules, causing you to make an
increased number of mistakes.The soundest rules you create are of no
help if you don’t develop the discipline to make decisions and act according
to your historically proven rules and game plan.
8. Concentrating your effort on what to buy and, once the buy
decision is made, not understanding when or under what conditions
the stock must be sold. Most investors have no rules or plan for selling
stocks, meaning that they are doing only half of the homework necessary to
succeed.
9. Failing to understand the importance of buying high-quality
companies with good institutional sponsorship and the importance
of learning how to use charts to significantly improve selection and
timing.

Twenty-One Costly Common Mistakes Most Investors Make
10. Buying more shares of low-priced stocks rather than fewer
shares of higher-priced stocks. Many people think it’s smarter to buy
round lots of 100 or 1,000 low-priced shares. This makes them feel like
they’re getting a lot more for their money. They’d be better off buying 30 or
50 shares of higher-priced, better-quality, better-performing companies.
Think in terms of dollarswhen you invest, not the number of shares you can
buy. Buy the best merchandise available, not the cheapest.
Many investors can’t resist $2, $5, or $10 stocks, but most stocks selling
for $10 or less are cheap for a reason. They’ve either been deficient in the
past or have something wrong with them now. Stocks are like anything else:
the best quality rarely comes at the cheapest price.
That’s not all. Low-priced stocks may cost more in commissions and
markups. And since they can drop 15% to 20% faster than most higher-
priced issues can, they also carry greater risk. Most professionals and insti-
tutions normally won’t invest in $5 and $10 stocks, so these stocks do not
have a top-notch following. Penny stocks are even worse. As discussed ear-
lier, institutional sponsorship is one of the ingredients needed to help pro-
pel a stock higher in price.
Cheap stocks also have larger spreads in terms of the percentage differ-
ence between the bid and ask price. Compare a $5 stock that trades $5 bid,
$5.25 ask with a $50 stock that trades $50 bid, $50.25 ask. On your $5 stock,
that $0.25 difference is 5% of the bid price. On your $50 stock, that $0.25
difference is a negligible 0.5%. The difference is a factor of 10. As a result,
with low-priced stocks, you tend to have much more ground to make up
from your initial buy point just to break even and overcome the spread.
11. Buying on tips, rumors, split announcements, and other news
events; stories; advisory-service recommendations; or opinions you
hear from other people or from supposed market experts on TV.
Many people are too willing to risk their hard-earned money on the basis of
what someone else says, rather than taking the time to study, learn, and
know for sure what they’re doing. As a result, they risk losing a lot of money.
Most rumors and tips you hear simply aren’t true. Even if they are true, in
many cases the stock concerned will ironically go down, not up as you
assume.
12. Selecting second-rate stocks because of dividends or low
price/earnings ratios. Dividends and P/E ratios aren’t anywhere near as
important as earnings per share growth. In many cases, the more a company
pays in dividends, the weaker it may be. It may have to pay high interest
rates to replenish the funds it is paying out in the form of dividends. Better-
performing companies typically will not pay dividends. Instead, they rein-
vest their capital in research and development (R&D) or other corporate

improvements. Also, keep in mind that you can lose the amount of a divi-
dend in one or two days’ fluctuation in the price of the stock. As for P/E
ratios, a low P/E is probably low because the company’s past record is infe-
rior. Most stocks sell for what they’re worth at any particular time.
13. Wanting to make a quick and easy buck.Wanting too much, too
fast—without doing the necessary preparation, learning the soundest meth-
ods, or acquiring the essential skills and discipline—can be your downfall.
Chances are, you’ll jump into a stock too fast and then be too slow to cut
your losses when you are wrong.
14. Buying old names you’re familiar with.Just because you used to
work for General Motors doesn’t necessarily make it a good stock to buy.
Many of the best investments will be newer names that you won’t know, but
that, with a little research, you could discover and profit from before they
become household names.
15. Not being able to recognize (and follow) good information
and advice. Friends, relatives, certain stockbrokers, and advisory services
can all be sources of bad advice. Only a small minority are successful enough
themselves to merit your consideration. Outstanding stockbrokers or advi-
sory services are no more plentiful than outstanding doctors, lawyers, or
ballplayers. Only one out of nine baseball players who sign professional con-
tracts ever make it to the big leagues. Most of the ballplayers coming out of
college simply are not professional caliber. Many brokerage firms have gone
out of business because they couldn’t manage their own money wisely. In
the 2000 era, some used unbelievable leverage. You never want to make
excessive use of borrowed money.
16. Cashing in small, easy-to-take profits while holding the losers.
In other words, doing exactly the opposite of what you should be doing: cut-
ting your losses short and giving your profits more time.
17. Worrying way too much about taxes and commissions. The
name of the game is to first make a net profit. Excessive worrying about
taxes usually leads to unsound investment decisions in the hope of achieving
a tax shelter. You can also fritter away a good profit by holding on too long in
an attempt to get a long-term capital gain. Some investors convince them-
selves they can’t sell because of taxes, but that’s ego trumping judgment.
The commissions associated with buying and selling stocks, especially
through an online broker, are minor compared with the money to be made
by making the right decisions in the first place and taking action when
needed. The fact that you pay relatively low commissions and you can get
out of your investment much faster are two of the biggest advantages of
owning stock over owning real estate. People can get over their head in real
estate and lose money if they overstep themselves. With instant liquidity in

Twenty-One Costly Common Mistakes Most Investors Make
equities, you can protect yourself quickly at low cost and take advantage of
highly profitable new trends as they emerge.
18. Speculating too heavily in options or futures because you see
them as a way to get rich quick. Some investors also focus mainly on
shorter-term, lower-priced options that involve greater volatility and risk.
The limited time period works against holders of short-term options. Some
people also write “naked options” (selling options on stocks they do not even
own), which amounts to taking greater risk for a potentially small reward.
19. Rarely transacting “at the market,” preferring instead to put
price limits on buy and sell orders.By doing so, investors are quibbling
over eighths and quarters of a point (or their decimal equivalents), rather
than focusing on the stock’s larger and more important movement. With
limit orders, you run the risk of missing the market completely and not get-
ting out of stocks that should be sold to avoid substantial losses.
20. Not being able to make up your mind when a decision needs
to be made. Many investors don’t know whether they should buy, sell, or
hold, and the uncertainty shows that they have no guidelines. Most people
don’t follow a proven plan, a set of strict principles or buy and sell rules, to
correctly guide them.
21. Not looking at stocks objectively.Many people pick favorites and
cross their fingers. Instead of relying on hope and their own opinions, suc-
cessful investors pay attention to the market, which is usually right.
How many of these describe your own past investment beliefs and prac-
tices? Poor principles and methods yield poor results; sound principles and
methods yield sound results.
After all of this, don’t feel discouraged. Just remember what Rockne said:
“Build up your weaknesses until they become your strong points.” It takes
time and a little effort to get it right, but in the end, it’s worth every minute
you spend on it. America offers a never-ending parade of new, outstanding
companies. You can learn to invest with knowledge and confidence to pro-
tect your money and at the same time find and properly handle highly suc-
cessful companies.

• CHAPTER •
More Models of Great
Stock Market Winners
Throughout this book, I’ve shown you and discussed many of the greatest
winning stocks of the past. Now that you’ve been introduced to the CAN SLIM
system of investing, you should know that we actually suggested some of
these same companies to clients through our institutional services firm or
bought them ourselves.
Regardless of your current position in life or your financial standing,
it’s clearly possible for you to make your dreams come true using the
CAN SLIM system. You may have heard or read about the thousands of indi-
viduals who have changed their lives using this book and Investor’s Business
Daily. It really happens, and it can happen to you if you are determined and
have an overpowering desire, no matter how large or small your account . . .
as long as you make up your mind, work at it, and don’t ever let yourself get
discouraged.
This chapter will introduce you to a few early examples of success using
this system. There are many, many others. In addition, it will also introduce
you to more of the great winning stocks since 1952. Study this chapter
closely; you’ll find these patterns repeat over and over again throughout
time. If you learn to recognize them early, you could get in on some future
big profits, even if it takes some time.
Tracing the Growth of a Small Account
In 1961, with $10 from each of my classmates at Harvard’s Program for Man-
agement Development (PMD), we started the first PMD Fund with the grand

total of $850. It was mostly for fun. Each classmate began with one $10 share
in the fund. Marshall Wolf, then with National Newark & Essex Bank, and
later an executive vice president at Midatlantic National Bank, had the thank-
less job of secretary-treasurer, keeping the records, informing the gang, and fil-
ing and paying taxes each year. I got the easy job of managing the money.
It’s an interesting account to study because it proves you can start very
small and still win the game if you stick with sound methods and give your-
self plenty of time. On September 16, 1986 (some 25 years later), after all
prior taxes had been paid and with Marshall having later kept some money
in cash, the account was worth $51,653.34. The profit, in other words, was
more than $50,000, and each share was worth $518. That is nearly a 50-fold
after-tax gain from less than $1,000 invested.
The actual buy and sell records in the accompanying table illustrate in
vivid detail the execution of the basic investment methods we have dis-
cussed up to this point.
Note that while there were about 20 successful transactions through
1964, there were also 20 losing transactions. However, the average profit
was around 20%, while the average loss was about 7%. If losses in Standard
Kollsman, Brunswick, and a few others had not been cut, later severe price
drops would have caused much larger losses. This small cash account con-
centrated in only one or two stocks at a time. Follow-up buys were generally
made if the security moved up in price.
The account made no progress in 1962, a bad market year, but it was
already up 139% by June 6, 1963, beforethe first Syntex buy was made. By the
end of 1963, the gain had swelled to 474% on the original $850 investment.
The year 1964 was lackluster. Worthwhile profits were made in 1965,
1966, and 1967, although nothing like 1963, which was a very unusual year.
I won’t bore you with 20 pages of stock transactions. Let me just say that the
next 10 years showed further progress, despite losses in 1969 and 1974.
Another period of interesting progress started in 1978 with the purchase
of Dome Petroleum. All decisions beginning with Dome are picked up and
shown in the second table.
Dome offers an extremely valuable lesson on why most stocks sooner or
later have to be sold. While it was bought, as you can see, at $77 and sold
near $98, it eventually fell below $2! History repeated itself in 2000 and
2001 when many Internet big winners like CMGI dropped from $165 to $1.
Note also that the account was worn out of Pic ’N’ Save on July 6, 1982, at
$15, but we bought it back at $18 and $19, even though this was a higher
price, and made a large gain by doing so. This is something you will have to
learn to do at some point. If you were wrong in selling, in a number of cases,
you’ll need to buy the stock back at higher prices.

PMD Fund Transactions, 1978–1986
The U.S. Investing Championship
Another engaging example of the CAN SLIM principles being properly
applied is the story of one of our associates, Lee Freestone. Lee participated
in the U.S. Investing Championship in 1991, when he was just 24 years old.
Using the CAN SLIM technique, he came in second for the year, with a
result of 279%. In 1992, he gained a 120% return and again came in second.
Lee was doing what David Ryan, another associate at the time, had done
when he participated in the U.S. Investing Championship in prior years and
won. The U.S. Investing Championship is not some paper transaction derby.
Real money is used, and actual transactions are made in the market. Lee
continued to invest successfully with even larger returns in the late 1990s.
So if it is followed with discipline, the CAN SLIM system has been bat-
tle-tested successfully through thick and thin from 1961 to 2009.

before the point where you want to take buying action.
If you think you’re just looking at a bunch of charts, think again. What you
are seeing are pictures of the price accumulation patterns of the greatest
winning stocks—just before their enormous price moves began. The charts
are presented in five configurations: cup-with-handle pattern, cup-without-
handle pattern, double-bottom pattern, flat-base pattern, and base-on-top-
of-a-base pattern. You need to learn to recognize these patterns.

• CHAPTER •
Picking the Best Market Themes,
Sectors, and Industry Groups
The majority of the leading stocks are usually in leading industries. Studies show
that 37% of a stock’s price movement is directly tied to the performance of
the industry group the stock is in. Another 12% is due to strength in its over-
all sector. Therefore, roughly half of a stock’s move is driven by the strength
of its respective group. Because specific industry groups lead each market
cycle, you can see how worthwhile it is to consider a stock’s industry before
making a purchase.
For the purposes of this discussion, there are three terms we will use: sec-
tor, industry group, and subgroup. A sector is a broad grouping of compa-
nies and industries. These include, for example, basic industries (or
“cyclicals”), consumer goods and services, transportation, finance, and high
technology. An industry groupis a smaller, more specific grouping of com-
panies; there normally are several industry groups within a sector. A sub-
group is even more specific, dividing the industry group into several very
precise subcategories.
For example, if we were to look at Viacom, it could be described as fol-
lows: Sector: Leisure and Entertainment Industry; Group: Media; and Sub-
group: Radio/TV. For clarity and ease of use, industry group and subgroup
names are generally combined, with the result simply being called “industry
groups.” For example, the industry group for Viacom is known as “Media—
Radio/TV.”

Why Track 197 Industry Groups?
Why does IBD divide securities into 197 industry groups rather than, say,
the smaller number of groups used by Standard & Poor’s? It’s simple really.
The stocks within a given sector do not all perform at the same rate. Even if
a sector is outperforming other sectors, there may be segments of that sec-
tor that are performing extremely well and others that are lagging the mar-
ket. It’s important that you be able to recognize what industry group within
the sector is acting the very best, since this knowledge can mean the differ-
ence between superior and mediocre results.
Early in our study of the market, we realized that many of the investment
services available at the time did not adequately dissect the market into
enough industry groups. It was therefore difficult to determine the specific
part of a group where the true leadership was. So we created our own indus-
try groups, breaking down the market into 197 different subcategories and
providing you, the investor, with more accurate and detailed insights into
the makeup of an industry. For example, the medical industry can be
divided into hospital companies, generic drugs, dental, home nursing,
genetics, biotech, and HMOs, plus a few other unique modern areas.
How You Can Decide Which Industry Groups
Are Leading the Market
When analyzing industries, we’ve found that some are so small that signs of
strength in the group may not be relevant. If there are only two small, thinly
traded companies within a subindustry, that’s not enough to consider them
a group. On the other hand, there are industries with too many companies,
such as chemicals and savings and loans. This excessive supply does not add
to these industries’ attractiveness, unless some extremely unusual changes
in industry conditions occur.
The 197 industry groups mentioned earlier can be found each business
day in Investor’s Business Daily. There we rank each subgroup according to
its six-month price performance so that you can easily determine which
industry subgroups are the true leaders. Buyers operating on the “underval-
ued” philosophy love to do their prospecting in the worst-ranked groups.
But analysis has shown that, on average, stocks in the top 50 or 100 groups
perform better than those in the bottom 100. To increase your odds of find-
ing a truly outstanding stock in an outstanding industry, concentrate on the
top 20 groups and avoid the bottom 20.

vices offer an additional, proprietary source of information to help you

Picking the Best Market Themes, Sectors, and Industry Groups
determine whether the stock you’re thinking about owning is in a top-flight
industry group. The Industry Group Relative Strength Rating assigns a let-
ter grade from A+ to E to each publicly traded company we follow, with A+
being best. A rating of A+, A, or A– means the stock’s industry group is in
the top 24% of all industry groups in terms of price performance.
Every day I also quickly check the “New Price Highs” list in IBD. It is
uniquely organized in order of the broad industry sectors with the most indi-
vidual stocks that made new price highs the previous day. You can’t find this
list in other business publications. Just note the top six or so sectors, particu-
larly in bull markets. They usually pick up the majority of the real leaders.
Another way you can find out what industry groups are in or out of favor
is to analyze the performance of a mutual fund family’s industry funds.
Fidelity Investments, one of the nation’s successful mutual fund managers,
has more than 35 industry mutual funds. A glance at their performance pro-
vides yet another excellent perspective on which industry sectors are doing
better. I’ve found it worthwhile to note the two or three Fidelity industry
funds that show the greatest year-to-date performance. This is shown in a
small special table in IBD every business day.
For William O’Neil + Co.’s institutional clients, a weekly Datagraph ser-
vice is provided that arranges the 197 industry groups in order of their
group relative price strength for the past six months. Stocks in the strongest
categories are shown in Volume 1 of the O’Neil Database books, and stocks
in the weaker groups are in Volume 2.
During a time period in which virtually all daily newspapers, including
theWall Street Journal, significantly cut the number of companies they cov-
ered in their main stock tables every business day and/or dramatically
reduced the number of helpful key data items shown daily for each stock,
here’s what Investor’s Business Dailydid.
IBD’s stock tables are now organized in order of performance, from the
strongest down to the weakest of 33 major economic sectors, such as med-
ical, retail, computer software, consumer, telecom, building, energy, Inter-
net, banks, and so on. Each sector combines NYSE and Nasdaq stocks so
you can compare every stock available in each sector to find the best stocks
in the best sectors based on a substantial number of key variables.
IBD now gives you 21 vital time-tested facts on 2,500 leading stocks in its
stock tables each business day . . . far more than most other daily newspa-
pers in America. These 21 facts are
1. An overall composite ranking from 1 to 99, with 99 best.
2. An earnings per share growth rating comparing each company’s last
two quarters and last three years’ growth with those of all other

stocks. A 90 rating means the company has outperformed 90% of all
stocks.
3. A Relative Price Strength rating comparing each stock’s price
change over the last 12 months with those of all other stocks. Bet-
ter firms rate 80 or higher on both EPS and RS.
4. A rating comparing a stock’s sales growth rate, profit margins, and
return on equity to those of all other stocks.
5. A highly accurate proprietary accumulation/distribution rating that
uses a price and volume formula to gauge whether a stock is under
accumulation (buying) or distribution (selling) in the last 13 weeks.
“A” denotes heavy buying; “E” indicates heavy selling.
6 & 7. Volume % change tells you each stock’s precise percentage change
above or below its average daily volume for the past 50 days along
with its total volume for the day.
8 & 9. The current and recent relative performance of each stock’s broad
industry sector.
10–12. Each stock’s 52-week high price, closing price, and change for the
day.
13–21. Price/earnings ratio, dividend yield, if the company repurchased its
stock in the last year, if the stock has options, if company earnings
will be reported in the next four weeks, if the stock was up 1 point
or more or made a new high, if the stock was down 1 point or more
or made a new low, if the stock had an IPO in the last eight years
and has an EPS and RS rating of 80 or higher, and if a recent IBD
story on the company is archived at Investors.com.
Not only does IBD follow more stocks and provide more vital data, but
the table print size is much larger and easier to read.
As of this writing in February 2009, the medical sector is number one.
These ratings will adjust and change as the weeks and months go by and
market conditions, news, and data change. I believe these significant and
relevant data for serious investors, regardless of whether they are new or
experienced, are light-years ahead of the data provided by most of IBD’s
competitors.
Considering some of the seeming disasters coming out of Wall Street and
the big-city banking community in 2008, we believe we are and have been
providing the American public—with our many books like the one you’re
reading, home study courses, more than a thousand seminars and work-
shops nationwide, plus Investor’s Business Daily—a source of relevant,
sound education, help, and guidance in an otherwise complex but key area

that much of the investment community and Washington may not have
always have handled as well.
The Vital Importance of Following Industry Trends
If economic conditions in 1970 told you to look for an improvement in hous-
ing and a big upturn in building, what stocks would you have included in
your definition of the building sector? If you had acquired a list of them,
you’d have found that there were hundreds of companies in that sector at
the time. So how would you narrow down your choices to the stocks that
were performing best? The answer: look at them from the industry group
and subgroup levels.
There were actually 10 industry groups within the building sector for
investors to consider during the 1971 bull market. That meant there were
10 different ways you could have played the building boom. Many institu-
tional investors bought stocks ranging from lumber producer Georgia
Pacific to wallboard leader U.S. Gypsum to building-products giant Arm-
strong Corp. You could have also gone with Masco in the plumbing group, a
home builder like Kaufman & Broad, building-material retailers and whole-
salers like Standard Brands Paint and Scotty’s Home Builders, or mortgage
insurers like MGIC. Then there were manufacturers of mobile homes and
other low-cost housing, suppliers of air-conditioning systems, and makers
and sellers of furniture and carpets.
Do you know where the traditional building stocks were during 1971?
They spent the year in the bottom half of all industry groups, while the
newer building-related subgroups more than tripled!
The mobile home group crossed into the top 100 industry groups on
August 14, 1970, and stayed there until February 12, 1971. The group
returned to the top 100 on May 14, 1971, and then fell into the bottom half
again later the following year, on July 28, 1972. In the prior cycle, mobile
homes were in the top 100 groups in December 1967 and dropped to the
bottom half only in the next bear market.
The price advances of mobile home stocks during these positive periods
were spellbinding. Redman Industries zoomed from a split-adjusted $6 to
$56, and Skyline moved from $24 to what equaled $378 on a presplit basis.
These are the kind of stocks that charts can help you spot if you learn to read
charts and do your homework. We study the historical model of all these
past great leaders and learn from them.
From 1978 to 1981, the computer industry was one of the leading sectors.
However, many money managers at that time thought of the industry as con-
sisting only of IBM, Burroughs, Sperry Rand, Control Data, and the like. But

these were all large mainframe computer manufacturers, and they failed to
perform during that cycle. Why? Because while the computer sector was hot,
older industry groups within it, such as mainframe computers, were not.
Meanwhile, the computer sector’s many new subdivisions performed
unbelievably. During that period, you could have selected new, relatively
unknown stocks from groups such as minicomputers (Prime Computer),
microcomputers (Commodore International), graphics (Computervision),
word processors (Wang Labs), peripherals (Verbatim), software (Cullinane
Database), or time-sharing (Electronic Data Systems). These fresh new
entrepreneurial winners increased five to ten times in price. (That’s the
“New” in CAN SLIM.) No U.S. administration can hold back America’s
inventors and innovators for very long—unless it is really stifling business
and the country.
During 1998 and 1999, the computer sector led again, with 50 to 75 com-
puter-related stocks hitting the number one spot on Investor’s Business
Daily’s new high list almost every day for more than a year. If you were alert
and knew what to look for, it was there to be seen. It was Siebel Systems,
Oracle, and Veritas in the enterprise software group, and Brocade and
Emulex among local network stocks that provided new leadership. The
computer–Internet group boomed with Cisco, Juniper, and BEA Systems;
and EMC and Network Appliance had enormous runs in the memory
group; while the formerly leading personal computer group lagged in 1999.
After their tremendous increases, most of these leaders then topped in 2000
along with the rest of the market.
Many new subgroups have sprung up since then, and many more will
spring up in the future as new technologies are dreamed up and applied. We
are in the computer, worldwide communications, and space age. New
inventions and technologies will spawn thousands of new and superior prod-
ucts and services. We’re benefiting from an endless stream of ingenious off-
shoots from the original mainframe industry, and in the past they came so
fast we had to update the various industry categories in our database more
frequently just to keep up with them.
There is no such thing as “impossible” in America’s free enterprise sys-
tem. Remember, when the computer was first invented, experts thought the
market for it was only two, and one would have to be bought by the govern-
ment. And the head of Digital Equipment later said he didn’t see why any-
one would ever want a computer in her home. When Alexander Graham
Bell invented the telephone, he was struggling and offered a half-interest in
the telephone to the president of Western Union, who replied, “What could
I do with an interesting toy like that?” Walt Disney’s board of directors, his
brother, and his wife didn’t like Walt’s idea to create Disneyland.

Picking the Best Market Themes, Sectors, and Industry Groups
In the bull market from 2003 to 2007, two of the best leaders in 1998 and
1999, America Online and Yahoo!, failed to lead, and new innovators like
Google and Priceline.com moved to the head of the pack. You have to stay
in phase with the new leaders in each new cycle. Here’s a historical fact to
remember: only one of every eight leaders in a bull market reasserts itself as
a leader in the next bull market. The market usually moves on to new lead-
ership, and America keeps growing, with new entrepreneurs offering you,
the investor, new opportunities.
A Look at Industries of the Past and
What’s Coming in the Future
At one time, computer and electronic stocks may outperform. In another
period, retail or defense stocks will stand out. The industry that leads in one
bull market normally won’t come back to lead in the next, although there
have been exceptions. Groups that emerge late in a bull phase are some-
times early enough in their own stage of improvement to weather a bear
market and then resume their advance, assuming leadership when a new
bull market starts.
These were the leading industry groups in each bull market from 1953
through 2007:
1953–1954 Aerospace, aluminum, building, paper, steel
1958 Bowling, electronics, publishing
1959 Vending machines
1960 Food, savings and loans, tobacco
1963 Airlines
1965 Aerospace, color television, semiconductors
1967 Computers, conglomerates, hotels
1968 Mobile homes
1970 Building, coal, oil service, restaurants, retailing
1971 Mobile homes
1973 Gold, silver
1974 Coal
1975 Catalog showrooms, oil
1976 Hospitals, pollution, nursing homes, oil
1978 Electronics, oil, small computers
1979 Oil, oil service, small computers
1980 Small computers
1982 Apparel, autos, building, discount supermarkets, military
electronics, mobile homes, retail apparel, toys

As you might imagine, industries of the future create gigantic opportuni-
ties for everyone. While they occasionally come into favor, industries of the
past offer less dazzling possibilities.
There were a number of major industries, mainly cyclical ones, that were
well past their peaks as of 2000. Many of them, however, came back from a
poor past to stronger demand from 2003 to 2007 as a result of the enormous
demand from China as it copied what the United States did in the early
1900s, when we created and built an industrial world leader.
China, with its long border with Russia, witnessed firsthand the 70-year-
old communist Soviet Union implode and disappear into the ash heap of
history. The Chinese learned from the enormous growth and higher stan-
dard of living created in America that its model had far more potential for
the Chinese people and their country. Most Chinese families want their one
child to get a college education and learn to speak English. Families in India
have many of the same aspirations.
Here is a list of these old-line industries:
1. Steel
2. Copper
3. Aluminum
4. Gold
5. Silver
6. Building materials

Tracking Nasdaq and NYSE Stocks Together Is Key
Groups that emerge as leaders in a new bull market cycle can be found by
observing unusual strength in one or two Nasdaq stocks and relating that
strength to similar power in a listed stock in the same group.
Initial strength in only one listed stock is not sufficient to attract attention
to a category, but confirmation by one or two kindred Nasdaq issues can
quickly steer you to a possible industry recovery. You can see this by looking
at the accompanying charts of home builder Centex’s OTC-traded stock

from March to August of 1970, and of home builder Kaufman & Broad’s
NYSE-listed shares from April to August of the same year:
1. Centex’s relative strength in the prior year was strong, and it made a new
high three months before the stock price did.
2. Earnings accelerated (by 50%) during the June 1970 quarter.
3. The stock was selling near an all-time high at the bottom of a bear market.
4. A strong Centex base coincided with the base in Kaufman & Broad.
In the 2003 bull market, Coach (COH) was a NYSE-listed stock that we
found on our weekly review of charts as it broke out of its base on February
28. It gave another buy point on April 25 when it bounced off its 10-week

begun in earnest after a major market follow-through day in the market
averages, and on April 25 two other leaders in the retail clothing industry—
Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Deckers Outdoor (DECK)— broke out at
the same time as the Coach move. Now there was plenty of evidence, from
one NYSE stock and two Nasdaq issues in the same industry group, of a
powerful new group coming alive for the new bull market that had just
started. This is one more reason IBD’s NYSE and Nasdaq tables are com-
bined and the stocks are shown by industry sectors. You can spot all the
leaders more easily when they’re together in a group.

A Key Stock’s Weakness Can Spill Over to the Group
Grouping and tracking stocks by industry group can also help you get out of
weakening investments faster. If, after a successful run, one or two impor-
tant stocks in a group break seriously, the weakness may sooner or later
“wash over” into the remaining stocks in that field. For example, in Febru-
ary 1973, weakness in some key building stocks suggested that even stal-
warts such as Kaufman & Broad and MGIC were vulnerable, despite the
fact that they were holding up well. At the time, fundamental research firms
were in unanimous agreement on MGIC. They were sure that the mortgage
insurer had earnings gains of 50% locked in for the next two years, and that
the company would continue on its merry course, unaffected by the build-
ing cycle. The fundamental stock analysts were wrong; MGIC later col-
lapsed along with the rest of the deteriorating group.
In the same month, ITT traded between $50 and $60 while every other
stock in the conglomerate group had been in a long decline. The two central
points overlooked by four leading research firms that recommended ITT in
1973 were that the group was very weak and that ITT’s relative strength was
trending lower, even though the stock itself was not.
Oil and Oil Service Stocks Top in 1980–1981
This same “wash-over effect” within groups was also seen in 1980–1981.
After a long advance in oil and oil service stocks, our early warning criteria
caused our institutional services firm to put stocks such as Standard Oil of
Indiana, Schlumberger, Gulf Oil, and Mobil on the “sell/avoid” side, mean-
ing we felt they should be avoided or sold.

Picking the Best Market Themes, Sectors, and Industry Groups
A few months later, data showed that we had turned negative on almost
the entire oil sector, and that we had seen the top in Schlumberger, the most
outstanding of all the oil service companies. Based objectively on all the his-
torical data, you had to conclude that, in time, the weakness would wash
over into the entire oil service industry. Therefore, we also added equities
such as Hughes Tool, Western Co. of North America, Rowan Companies,
Varco International, and NL Industries to the sell/avoid list even though the
stocks were making new price highs and showed escalating quarterly earn-
ings—in some cases by 100% or more.
These moves surprised many experienced professionals on Wall Street
and at large institutions, but we had studied and documented how
groups historically had topped in the past. Our actions were based on
historical facts and sound principles that had worked over decades, not
on analysts’ personal opinions or possibly one-sided information from
company officials.
Our service is totally and completely different from that of all Wall Street
research firms because we do not hire analysts, make buy or sell recom-
mendations, or write any research reports. We use supply-and-demand
charts, facts, and historical precedents that now cover all common stocks
and industries from the 1880s through 2008.
The decision to suggest that clients avoid or sell oil and oil service stocks
from November 1980 to June 1981 was one of our institutional firm’s more
valuable calls at the time. We even told a Houston seminar audience in
October 1980 the entire oil sector had topped. A full 75% of those in atten-
dance owned petroleum stocks. They probably didn’t believe a word we
said. We were not aware at the time, or even in the several months follow-
ing, of any other New York Stock Exchange firm that had taken that same
negative stand across the board on the energy and related drilling and ser-
vice sectors. In fact, the exact opposite occurred. Because of such decisions,
William O’Neil + Co. became a leading provider of historical precedent
ideas to many of the nation’s top institutional investors.
Within a few months, all these stocks began substantial declines. Profes-
sional money managers slowly realized that once the price of oil had topped
and the major oil issues were under liquidation, it would be only a matter of
time before drilling activity would be cut back.
In the July 1982 issue of Institutional Investormagazine, ten energy ana-
lysts at eight of the largest and most respected brokerage firms took a dif-
ferent tack. They advised purchasing these securities because they
appeared cheap and because they had had their first correction from their
price peak. This is just another example of how personal opinions, even if
they come from the highest research places or bright young MBAs from

outstanding Ivy League universities, are quite often wrong when it comes to
making and preserving money in the stock market.
The same situation occurred again in 2008 when we first put Schlum-
berger on the sell/avoid list at $100 on July 3. Schlumberger—the quality
leader in the oil sector—closed below its 10-week moving average every
week as it began its slow, steady topping process along with other oil
stocks. Many institutions, on analysts’ recommendations, bought the oils
too soon on the way down because they seemed such a bargain. Mean-
while, oil itself was midway in the process of collapsing from $147 a barrel
to $35 to $50.
In August 2000, a survey showed many analysts had high-tech stocks as
strong buys. Six months later, in one of the worst markets in many years,
roughly the same proportion of analysts still said tech stocks were strong
buys. Analysts certainly missed with their opinions. Only 1% of them said to
sell tech stocks. Opinions, even by experts, are frequently wrong; markets
rarely are. So learn to read what the market is telling you, and stop listening
to ego and personal opinions. Analysts who don’t understand this are des-
tined to cause some substantial losses for their clients. We measure histori-
cal market facts, not personal opinions.
We do not visit or talk to any companies, have analysts to write research
reports, or have or believe in inside information. Nor are we a quantitative
firm. We tell our institutional subscribers who have teams of fundamental
analysts to have their analysts check with their sources and the companies
concerned to decide which of our rather unusual ideas based on historical
precedent may be sound and right fundamentally and which are possibly
not right. Institutions have always had a prudent personal responsibility for
the stocks they invest in. We make our mistakes too, because the stock mar-
ket is never a certainty. But when we make mistakes, we correct them rather
than sit with them.
The Bowling Boom Tops in 1961
Beginning in 1958 and continuing into 1961, Brunswick’s stock made a huge
move. The stock of AMF, which also made automatic pinspotters for bowl-
ing alleys, gyrated pretty much in unison with Brunswick. After Brunswick
peaked in March 1961, it rallied back to $65 from $50, but for the first time,
AMF did not recover along with it. This was a tip-off that the entire group
had made a long-term top, that the rebound in Brunswick wasn’t going to
last, and that the stock—as great as it had been—should be sold.
One practical, commonsense industry rule is to avoid buying any stock
unless its strength and attractiveness are confirmed by at least one other

important stock in the same group. You can get away without such confir-
mation in a few cases where the company does something truly unique, but
these situations are very few in number. From the late 1980s to the late
1990s, Walt Disney fell into this category: a unique high-quality entertain-
ment company rather than just another filmmaker in the notoriously
unsteady, less-reliable movie group.
Two other valuable concepts turned up as we built historical models in
the stock market. The first we named the “follow-on effect,” and the second,
the “cousin stock theory.”
The “Follow-On Effect”
Sometimes, a major development takes place in one industry and related
industries later reap follow-on benefits. For example, in the late 1960s, the
airline industry underwent a renaissance with the introduction of jet air-
planes, causing airline stocks to soar. A few years later, the increase in air
travel spilled over to the hotel industry, which was more than happy to
expand to meet the rising number of travelers. Beginning in 1967, hotel
stocks enjoyed a tremendous run. Loews and Hilton were especially big
winners. The follow-on effect, in this case, was that increased air travel cre-
ated a shortage of hotel space.
When the price of oil rose in the late 1970s, oil companies began drilling
like mad to supply the suddenly pricey commodity. As a result, higher oil
prices fueled a surge not only in oil stocks in 1979, but also in the stocks of
oil service companies that supplied the industry with exploration equipment
and services.
The roaring success of small- and medium-sized computer manufactur-
ers during the 1978–1981 bull market created follow-on demand for com-
puter services, software, and peripheral products in the market resurgence
of late 1982. As the Internet took off in the mid-1990s, people discovered an
insatiable demand for faster access and greater bandwidth. Soon network-
ing stocks surged, with companies specializing in fiber optics enjoying mas-
sive gains in their share prices.
The “Cousin Stock” Theory
If a group is doing exceptionally well, there may be a supplier company, a
“cousin stock,” that’s also benefiting. As airline demand grew in the mid-
1960s, Boeing was selling a lot of new jets. Every new Boeing jet was outfit-
ted with chemical toilets made by a company called Monogram Industries.
With earnings growth of 200%, Monogram stock had a 1,000% advance.

INVESTING LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
In 1983, Fleetwood Enterprises, a leading manufacturer of recreational
vehicles, was a big winner in the stock market. Textone was a small cousin
stock that supplied vinyl-clad paneling and hollow-core cabinet doors to RV
and mobile home companies.
If you notice a company that’s doing particularly well, research it thor-
oughly. In the process, you may discover a supplier company that’s also
worth investing in.
Basic Conditions Change in an Industry
Most group moves occur because of substantial changes in industry conditions.
In 1953, aluminum and building stocks had a powerful bull market as a
result of pent-up demand for housing in the aftermath of the war. Wallboard
was in such short supply that some builders offered new Cadillacs to gyp-
sum board salespeople for just letting them buy a carload of their product.
In 1965, the onrush of the Vietnam War, which was to cost $20 billion or
more, created solid demand for electronics used in military applications and
defense during the war. Companies such as Fairchild Camera climbed more
than 200% in price.
In the 1990s, discount brokerage firms continued to gain market share
relative to full-service firms as investing became more and more main-
stream. At that time, a historical check proved that Charles Schwab, one of
the most successful discount brokerage firms, had performed as well as
market leader Microsoft during the preceding years—a valuable fact few
people knew then.
Watch for New Trends as They Develop
In our database research, we also pay attention to the areas of the country
where corporations are located. In our ratings of companies as far back as
1971, we assigned extra points for those headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and
other key growth or technology centers, such as California’s Silicon Valley.
Recently, however, California’s high-cost, high-tax business environment
has caused a number of companies to move out of the state to Utah, Ari-
zona, and the Southwest.
Shrewd investors should also be aware of demographic trends. From data
such as the number of people in various age groups, it’s possible to predict
potential growth for certain industries. The surge of women into the work-
place and the gush of baby boomers help explain why stocks like The Lim-
ited, Dress Barn, and other retailers of women’s apparel soared between
1982 and 1986.

==================================================

339
Picking the Best Market Themes, Sectors, and Industry Groups
It also pays to understand the basic nature of key industries. For example,
high-tech stocks are 21⁄ times as volatile as consumer stocks, so if you don’t
2
buy them right, you can suffer larger losses. Or if you concentrate most of
your portfolio in them, they could all come down at the same time. So, be
aware of your risk exposure if you get overconcentrated in the volatile high-
tech sector or any other possibly risky area.
Sometimes Defensive Groups May Flash General Market Clues
It’s also important for investors to know which groups are “defensive” in
nature. If, after a couple of bull market years, you see buying in groups such
as gold, silver, tobacco, food, grocery, and electric and telephone utilities,
you may be approaching a top. Prolonged weakness in the utility average
could also be signaling higher interest rates and a bear market ahead.
The gold group moved into the top half of all 197 industries on February
22, 1973. Anyone who was ferreting out such information at that time got
the first crystal-clear warning of one of the worst market upheavals up to
that point since 1929.
60% or More of Big Winners Are Part of Group Moves
Of the most successful stocks from 1953 through 1993, nearly two out of
three were part of group advances. So remember, the importance of staying
on top of your research and being aware of new group movements cannot
be overestimated.

How I Use IBD to Find
Potential Winning Stocks
Why We Created Investor’s Business Daily
For decades, professional money managers were the only ones who had access
to the in-depth data that are critical to finding winning stocks. In effect, they
had a monopoly on relevant investment information. That’s why I started
Investor’s Business Dailyin April 1984: to bring the needed information to
all investors, small or large, new or experienced.
Known for its investing capabilities as far back as the early 1960s, William
O’Neil + Co. built the first computerized daily stock market database in the
United States to track and compare stock performance. Detailed tracking
uncovered key insights into what produces stock market winners, particu-
larly their characteristics beforethey make a major price move.
Much of this information is now available through Investor’s Business
Daily, which offers everyone—professional and individual investors alike—
a better opportunity to grow and profit from the detailed data. Because our
primary concern is understanding and interpreting the national economy
using our comprehensive database, Investor’s Business Dailyis a vital infor-
mation provider first and a newspaper second.
If you’re serious about becoming a more successful investor, it is posi-
tively within your grasp. If you can commit to studying the time-tested,
historically proven strategies outlined in this book, being disciplined, and
focusing on daily and weekly learning, you’re more than halfway there.
IBD’s proprietary research tools are the other half of the equation. For
many of you, this means familiarizing yourself with data, methods, and

concepts very different from those you’re accustomed to hearing, seeing,
and using.
For example, according to our historical study of all the greatest winning
stocks, if you’d been relying on P/E ratios, you would have missed almost
every major winner for decades. The information in IBD is based on the
characteristics of the most successful companies of all time before their
major price moves. Following these valid model examples of success has
helped me and many others achieve success since the 1960s.
Investor’s Business Daily began in April 1984 with only 15,000 sub-
scribers. In the years prior to our launch, the Wall Street Journal grew
steadily to reach its peak of 2.1 million domestic circulation by our 1984
introduction date. Since that time, Investor’s Business Daily has increased
its market share over many years. In key high-population areas such as
southern California, Florida, and Long Island, New York, IBD has a larger
than normal number of readers. While many of our readers were former
Wall Street Journalsubscribers, there is little current duplication of reader-
ship, since several surveys show that only 16% of IBD subscribers also take
theJournal.
How Investor’s Business Daily Is Different
So what is it exactly that distinguishes IBD from other sources? Let’s take a
closer look.
• IBD makes it easier to search for winning stocks.With more than
10,000 publicly traded stocks to choose from, IBD provides perfor-
mance lists and proven proprietary fundamental and technical ratings
and rankings that help you narrow your choices to only the very best
opportunities.
• It offers quicker, easier, and more accurate and reliable ways to
interpret the general market. The key elements of the day’s trading
action are explained in IBD’s “The Big Picture” column to give you a
sound perspective on the health of the overall market and improve your
timing of buy and sell decisions. In tough markets like 2000–2003 and
2007–2009, this is critical information.
• It provides you valuable investing education and support. IBD’s
entire focus is on solid database research and extensive historical model
building to serve as examples—facts, not personal opinions. There are a
multitude of sources outlined in this chapter that can help you learn and
understand how the market really works, based on years of historical
precedent.

INVESTING LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
A New, Better Way to Find Winning Stocks
At Investor’s Business Daily, we’ve developed an entirely different way to
search for winning stocks. That’s because after more than four decades of
historical research, we know top stocks show definite signs of strength
before they become exceptional winners. That confuses people who prefer
a bargain—the low-priced, unknown stocks they hope will take off and sur-
prise us all. As we’ve said, cheap stocks are cheap for a reason: they have
deficiencies that don’t allow the stock to progress. For a stock to move
higher, it needs earnings growth and strong sales, plus several other factors
that demonstrate it’s emerging as a new leader. If you catch such a stock at
the early stages, you will be able to capitalize on its enormous progress.
Remember, the greatest winners of all time, like Cisco Systems and Home
Depot, began their biggest price moves after they’d gained leadership in earn-
ings, sales growth, and the other factors described in this book. Some of the
critical data you need to start your search can be found in the IBD stock tables.
The unique IBD ratings are a way to spot potential winners before they
take off, so it’s important that you review these ratings daily. IBD’s stock tables
are different from anything you’ll see anywhere else. Proprietary SmartSelect
Corporate Ratings speak volumes about each stock’s performance and how
a stock compares to all the others in our database. The elements in these
ratings, which are numbered 1 through 6 in the accompanying chart, are
explained in detail here.

How I Use IBD to Find Potential Winning Stocks
The IBD SmartSelect®Corporate Ratings
The one line of information in the IBD SmartSelect Corporate Ratings is
much more powerful and meaningful than anything you’ll find in standard
price tables. These ratings, which have been proven to be the most predic-
tive measurements of a stock’s possible future value, will narrow your search
from over 10,000 stocks to the top investment prospects.
You’ll find these ratings are like a condensed statistical summary financial
report that looks at the fundamental strength or weakness of a stock. They
are also a well-rounded evaluation of each company’s general health. Most
importantly, along with daily and/or weekly charts, these ratings will help
you find better stocks. Let’s examine each element.
Earnings per Share Rating Indicates
a Company’s Relative Earnings Growth Rate
Strong earnings growth is essential to a stock’s success and has the greatest
impact on its future price performance. The first absolutely vital component
of the SmartSelectratings is the Earnings per Share (EPS) rating, which is
labeled 1 in the chart.
The EPS rating calculates the growth and stability of each company’s
earnings over the last three years, giving additional weight to the most
recent few quarters. The result is compared with those of all other common
stocks in the price tables and is rated on a scale from 1 to 99, with 99 being
the best.
Example:An EPS rating of 90 means that a company’s bottom-line earn-
ings results over the short and the long term are in the top 10% of the
roughly 10,000 stocks being measured.
This one number gives you the relative earnings performance for publicly
held companies and the possible prospects for their stocks. It’s an objective
measure you can use to compare the audited results of one company to
those of any other; for example, the earnings growth of IBM to that of
Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed, Loews Companies, Wal-Mart, or Apple. Earn-
ings estimates are not used in the calculation because they are personal
opinions, which, as you know, might be wrong and do change.
Since earnings power and earnings growth are the most basic measures of
a company’s success, the EPS rating is invaluable for separating the true
leaders from the poorly managed, deficient, and lackluster companies in
today’s tougher worldwide competition.
The EPS rating is also more meaningful than the widely followed For-
tune 500 lists that rank corporations by company size. Size alone rarely
guarantees innovation, growth, or profitability. Large companies that are

between 50 and 100 years old may have a well-known brand image, but
often they are losing market share to younger, more innovative companies
that have created newer, better products. Consider the decline of some of
our auto companies and their unions, Alcoa, Eastman Kodak, International
Paper, Xerox, CBS, Gannett, and Citigroup.
Relative Price Strength Rating Shows Emerging Price Leaders
Since we’ve learned that the best stocks are superior price performers even
before their major moves, you should look for stocks with price leadership.
The Relative Price Strength (RS) rating shows you which stocks are the best
price performers, measuring a stock’s performance over the previous 12
months. That performance is then compared with the performance of all
other publicly traded companies and given a 1 to 99 rating, with 99 being
best. Look at the column labeled 2 in the chart example.
Example:An RS rating of 85 means the stock’s price movement has out-
performed 85% of all other common stocks in the last year. The greatest
winning stocks since 1952 and even much earlier showed an average RS rat-
ing of 87 when they broke out of their first price consolidation areas (bases).
In other words, the greatest stocks were already outperforming nearly 90%,
or nine out of 10, of all other stocks in the market before they made their
biggest price gains.
Even in poor markets, a Relative Price Strength rating that breaks below
70 can forewarn you of a possible problem situation. On the sell side, how-
ever, we have a ton of sell rules that can lead you to sell most stocks sooner
and more effectively than relying on a deteriorating relative strength line
that is calculated using the past 12 months’ price action. When you compare
these fact-based performance ratings to the old, unscientific methods,
which were typically based on faulty personal opinions, beliefs, academic
theories, stories, promotions, egos, tips, and rumors, it becomes inarguable
that IBD’s unique factual ratings can give you a more clearheaded edge up
in the complex market.
You Need Both Strong EPS and Strong RS Ratings
The implications of both the Earnings per Share rating and the Relative
Price Strength rating are considerable. So far, you’ve been able to deter-
mine the top leaders in earnings and relative price strength. The vast major-
ity of superior stocks will rank 80 or higher on both the EPS and the RS
ratingsbeforetheir major moves. Since one of these is a fundamental mea-
surement and the other is a marketplace valuation, insisting on both num-
bers being strong should, in positive markets, materially improve your
selection process.

How I Use IBD to Find Potential Winning Stocks
Of course, there’s no guarantee that a company’s terrific past or current
record won’t suddenly turn sour in the future. That’s why you must always
use a loss-cutting strategy, such as the sell rules discussed in Chapters 10
and 11. It’s also prudent and essential to check the stock’s daily or weekly
chart to see if it’s in a proper base or if it’s extended in price too far above its
most recent area of consolidation. (For a review of common chart patterns
to watch for, refer back to Chapter 2.)
As previously discussed, models of the best-performing companies over
the last century showed that earnings growth for the last three years and
percent increase in earnings per share for the latest two or three quarters
were the two most common fundamental characteristics.
Having hard data like these available to you naturally begs the question,
why would you ever invest your hard-earned dollars in a sluggish stock that
sports a 30 EPS rating or a 40 RS rating when there are literally thousands
of companies with higher ratings, including hundreds with superlative
numbers?
It’s not that companies with poor ratings can’t perform. It’s just that a
greater percentage of them turn out to be disappointments. Even when a
low-rated company has a decent price move, you’ll find that the better-rated
stocks in the same industry have probably done much better.
In a way, the combination of the EPS rating and the RS rating is similar
to A. C. Nielsen’s viewer ratings for TV shows. Who wants to continue spon-
soring a TV show that gets poor ratings?
Now, pretend for a minute you’re the manager of the New York Yankees.
It’s off-season, and you’re going to pick new players for next year’s team.
Would you trade for, recruit, or sign only .200 hitters? Or would you select
as many .300 hitters as possible? The .300 hitters cost you more money;
their P/Es are higher, and they sell nearer to their price high. It’s true the
.200 hitters are available at a cheaper price, but how many games will you
win with nine players in your lineup averaging .200? When the bases are
loaded in the ninth inning and the score is tied, who would you rather see
step up to the plate: a .200 hitter or a .300 hitter? How often does an estab-
lished .200 hitter blossom into a batting champion?
Selecting and managing a portfolio of stocks is no different from baseball
when it comes to performance. To win consistently and finish first in your
division, you need a roster of the very best players available—those with
proven records of excellence. You won’t do as well in your investing if you
insist on buying poorer performers and “cheaper stocks,” or those with
some positive features but three or four little-noticed defects, in the hope of
“discovering” a winner. Every little detail separates winners from losers.
Hope never works in the market unless you start with a high-quality stock

that’s begun to build steam. It’s the “steam” (earnings, sales, and price and
volume strength) that is the key prerequisite for future growth. Don’t be
fooled by bargain-basement thinking or buy stocks on the way down
because they look cheap. Replace your hopes and fallible personal opinions
with proven, measurable facts.
It’s also interesting to note that these practical, no-nonsense ratings have
helped to wake up corporate board members and put pressure on manage-
ment teams producing second-rate results. A consistently low IBD relative
performance rating should be a serious wake-up call to any top management
team or board of directors.
Strong Sales, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity Are a Big Clue
Cutting costs may boost a company’s earnings for a quarter or two, but pow-
erful, sustained profit increases require healthy sales growth. It’s also impor-
tant to buy companies that make the most of their sales growth. How much
profit do they generate from each dollar of sales? How well do they use their
capital? The Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity (SMR®) rating com-
bines these important fundamental factors and is the fastest way to identify
truly outstanding companies with real sales growth and profitability. These
are factors that are widely followed by the better analysts and portfolio man-
agers. The SMR rating is on an A to E scale, with A and B being the best. In
most cases, you want to avoid stocks with an SMR rating of D or E. See the
column labeled 3 on the chart.
Example:An SMR rating of A puts a stock in the top 20% of companies in
terms of sales growth, profitability, and return on equity. During the brief rally
that followed the Nasdaq’s bear market plunge from March to May 2000, SDL
Inc. shot ahead as a leading performer. The maker of components for fiber-
optic networks broke out to new highs just as the market confirmed a new
uptrend, the most ideal situation for buying a stock. SDL Inc. ran up 112% in
just eight weeks. Among its many strong qualities was an SMR rating of A.
For those of you who may not have always checked your stocks’ return on
equity, it’s important. Here’s a table of past leaders that shows their ROEs.
Accumulation/Distribution—The Influence of Professional Trading on Stocks
Professional investors wield a huge amount of influence over a stock’s price.
Thus, it’s essential that you buy the better stocks that mutual funds are buy-
ing and that you sell or avoid the ones they may be selling on a heavy basis.
Trying to go against this monumental amount of trading will only hurt your
results. A quick, efficient way to keep track of the end result of professional
trading is to use IBD’s Accumulation/Distribution Rating (the column
labeled 4 on the chart), which is based on daily price and volume changes.

INVESTING LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
When a stock receives an A or B rating in Investor’s Business Daily, it
means that the stock is being bought on balance. However, this does not
guarantee that it will go up. The buying activity is being picked up, but
maybe the funds are buying into a questionable position, and what they are
doing could be wrong. In some cases, stocks rated as D should be avoided.
I would not buy a stock with an E rating. Later, however, if and when the
market improves, it could change. C-rated stocks may be OK.
You needn’t feel you’ve missed out on the trading action if you spot heavy
buying or selling. Many funds take weeks or even months to complete their
positions in a stock or rid themselves of those positions, which gives you
time to capitalize on that action. However, be sure to check a daily or weekly
stock chart to see if the stock is in the early, beginning stage of a move or if
it is overextended in price and too risky or late to more safely buy.
Composite Rating: An Overview
The rating in the first column of the IBD stock tables is the SmartSelect
Composite Rating, which combines all four SmartSelectratings into a sum-
mary rating for quick review of overall performance. Look at the column
labeled 5. The SmartSelectComposite Rating formula is simple:
• Because of the impact of earnings and previous price performance on
stock price, double weighting is given to both the Earnings per Share and
the Relative Price Strength ratings. This weighting may change some-
what in the future as we continue to improve our ratings. Normal weight
is given to the Industry Group Relative Strength, SMR, and Accumula-
tion/Distribution ratings.
• The percent off the stock’s 52-week high is also used in the SmartSelect
Composite Rating.
• The results are then compared to the entire database, and a 1 to 99 rating
(with 99 being best) summarizes the five most predictive measurements
we’ve just discussed.
For some stocks, the SmartSelectComposite Rating may be higher than
the four individual SmartSelect ratings. This is because the formula is
weighted and includes the stock’s percent off its 52-week high.
When you review the stock tables, this simple rating gives you an enor-
mous time-saving edge. Work your way down the columns and look for
SmartSelectComposite Ratings of 80 or better to spot the potential strong
opportunities when you are in an uptrending general market.
The next step is to review all four individual SmartSelectratings: EPS, RS,
SMR and Accumulation/Distribution. With a quick scan of the stock tables,
you’re now that much closer to being sure you are selecting better stocks.

How I Use IBD to Find Potential Winning Stocks
Volume Percent Change Tracks the Big Money Flow
Another important measurement IBD created is Volume Percent Change
(see the column labeled 6). Most newspapers and information providers on
TV and the Web provide only a stock’s trading volume for the day, which
doesn’t tell the entire, meaningful story. Based on the volume information
they provide, how would you know whether the volume for all the stocks in
your portfolio and those you’re considering for purchase is normal, abnor-
mally low, or abnormally high?
In order to know this, you’d have to keep in your head or on paper what
the average daily volume is for each stock under review. Instead, you can
rely on IBDto keep track of this key measure of supply and demand for you.
IBDwas the first to provide investors with a Volume Percent Change mea-
sure that monitors what the normal daily trading level for every stock has
been over the most recent 50 trading days. It pays to always have the most
relevant facts, not just a bunch of numbers.
Stocks trade at many different volume levels, and any major change in
volume can give you extremely significant clues. One stock may trade an
average of 10,000 shares a day, while another trades 200,000 shares a day,
and still another trades 5 million shares a day. The key is not how many
shares were traded, but whether a particular day’s volume activity is or is not
unusually above or below average. For example, if a stock with an average
trading volume of 10,000 shares suddenly trades 70,000 shares, while its
price jumps one point, the stock has increased in price on a 600% increase
in volume—generally a positive sign as long as other market and fundamen-
tal measurements are constructive.
If this happens, the Volume Percent Change column will show a +600%,
which quickly alerts you to possible emerging professional interest in the
stock. (In this case, the stock is trading 600% above its normal volume, and
if the price is up substantially all of a sudden; this can be a major tip-off.)
Volume Percent Change is like having a computer in your pocket to care-
fully monitor the changing supply and demand for every single stock.
Where else can you get such preeminently critical data?
Almost all daily newspapers have cut out essential information in their
stock tables. This includes the Wall Street Journal, which no longer even
shows a stock’s trading volume in its daily stock tables.
Volume Percent Change is one of the main reasons so many specialists on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange, professional portfolio managers, top-
producing stockbrokers, and savvy individual investors use and refer to IBD’s
stock tables. There is no better way to track the flow of money into and out of
companies, if you know how to utilize these data. If price is all you look at when
you check your stocks, you’re like a piano player who plays with only one hand,

uses only one finger, has never heard of a chord or foot pedal, or doesn’t read
sheet music, so he never knows when to speed up, get loud, or get softer.
Investor’s Business Daily is more than a newspaper. It’s also a gigantic
radar set that monitors every variable that’s important to the successful
investor. And it lays all the information out for you daily, both in print and
electronically, with the version that’s available on the Internet.
The electronic version lets you have the information sooner—within
hours after the market closes. Investors who like to prepare for the next
trading day find this especially convenient. Others prefer a paper they can
carry with them, make notes on, and use as a valuable guidebook.
How to Use Investor’s Business Daily
Whether she uses the print or the electronic version (or both), each reader
probably has a different way of reading the paper. My preference is to start
with the front page and then proceed page by page to the end.
Front Page Comes First
The first feature I check on the front page is the short, quick market sum-
maries at the top, above the paper’s nameplate. These show price and vol-
ume changes for the S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrials, and the
Nasdaq, plus brief, two-line comments on market highlights. Brief notes on
fixed income, currency, and commodities are also shown.
For example, the comment under NYSE volume reads, “Volume above
average, up from previous day.” In 40 seconds I look at these briefs to make
sure I didn’t miss anything important from the day’s action.
S&P 500INDEX DOW JONES IND. NYSE VOL. (MIL) NASDAQ NASDAQ VOL. (MIL)

explode on upside lead blue chip rally up from previous day chips up for fourth day sinceNov.21 low
“IBD’s Top 10” Stories
The second thing I read on page one is “IBD’s Top 10,” a quick, time-saving
way to stay informed. In briefs of only seven to nine lines each, the ten most
important new stories are summarized. Today, for example, the number two
story tells how same-store sales were down last month at most retail chains,
but Wal-Mart’s were not only up but better than expected. In the number
three spot is, “Senate Nears Vote On Stimulus,” an update on Congress’s
efforts to come up with an economic recovery plan.

==================================================

How I Use IBD to Find Potential Winning Stocks
The Big Picture
The third feature I always check on page A1 is the “The Big Picture” column at
the bottom. It’s a fairly short but excellent summary of market action and key
developments. Inside the column is “Market Pulse,” a valuable box that notes
leaders that were up in volume for the day and those that were down. The pulse
also lets you know whether the market’s in an uptrend or a declining phase.
“The Big Picture” column is one of IBD’s most highly read features. Ded-
icated readers have repeatedly told us it has helped them immeasurably in
dissecting the general market. In fact, more than a thousand have given tes-
timonials on how it has helped them raise cash when the market began get-
ting difficult or determine when it was starting a major uptrend.
Top Stories
Finally, I glance at the headlines on the main two front-page stories. I’m a
headline reader: if a story is on a subject I want to know about, I read it; if
not, I skip it and go to the next page.
The top stories will often show charts or tables. The one I’m looking at
has a table of 15 retailers. It shows sales changes for the month plus same-
store results and estimates for the future. This quickly tells me three com-
panies in the field are doing excellently, but many others aren’t.
To The Point
Page 2 saves a busy executive or investor time. Titled “To The Point,” it pro-
vides some 50 business briefs, arranged by industry sector, and short sum-
maries on the nation, the world, and the economy. I can quickly scan each
headline and read the briefs I’m interested in. There’s also a column called
“Trends and Innovations” that I always try to read to learn about the new
things that keep being invented in today’s society.

In the middle is a feature that’s particularly valuable to the investor: a
half-dozen short stories about companies that reported earnings after the
close and how the market reacted in after-hours trading. This is a fast way to
make sure you didn’t miss anything after the market close.
Leaders & Success
“Leaders & Success” on page A3 is a unique feature that’s been in the paper
since we started. I always read “Wisdom to Live By”—the short two- or
three-line quotes from famous people at the top of the page.
Many people find inspiration on this page. It’s about people who have
been immensely successful: what they did and how they did it, what they
believed in and how they overcame the problems they faced along the way.
10 Secrets To Success
Another element on the page is called IBD’s “10 Secrets To Success.” A lot
of parents teach this to their kids by having them read these little short sto-
ries. The ten secrets start with “How You Think Is Everything: Always Be
Positive. Think Success, Not Failure. Beware of a Negative Environment.”
The second is “Decide upon Your True Dreams and Goals: Write Down
Your Specific Goals and Develop a Plan to Reach Them.” The third is “Take
Action: Goals Are Nothing without Action. Don’t Be Afraid to Get Started.
Just Do It.” The fourth is “Never Stop Learning: Go Back to School or Read
Books. Get Training and Acquire Skills.” And so on, until you get to the last
one, which is “Be Honest and Dependable; Take Responsibility: Otherwise,
Nos. 1–9 Won’t Matter.”
Below the list, one of the 10 secrets is discussed in detail each day. Par-
ents find this is something their children don’t get in school, and they use it
to help them learn the basic principles of how to succeed in life.
Rounding out the “Leaders & Success” page are two profiles of out-
standing people, past and present, and how they succeeded.
Internet and Technology
The next page focuses on “Internet and Technology.” Some investors don’t
spend much time here. But if tech stocks are leading the market, you want
to read this section to be on top of the discussions. We have a bureau in Sil-
icon Valley staffed by experienced reporters who’ve been with us many
years. The page they put together is designed not only for investors, but for
anyone in the tech industry—computer programmers, engineers, systems
people, and others.
We have a subscriber who works at a big outfit the government uses to
research how inventions might be applicable to defense efforts. One of the

firm’s top researchers has found that our writers get their facts straighter
and understand the technologies better than those on most of the business
magazines. We also have CEOs of computer software companies that sub-
scribe to IBD.
Your Weekly Review
There is a feature in the first section called “Your Weekly Review.” It
includes a table of 35 stocks showing strong weekly gains and a chart on
each one. It also includes a story on some of the companies. In a recent
story, Paul Whitfield tells how the stocks of Netflix, Edwards Life Sciences,
Matrix Initiative, and McDonald’s are all acting in a superior way accompa-
nied by interesting news.
Inside Real Estate
The next page I turn to is “Inside Real Estate.” I don’t normally read this,
but somebody who is interested in the real estate market certainly should.
The New America
Next is ”The New America” page, devoted to young, entrepreneurial com-
panies. One company gets extensive treatment each day. At the top of the
page, we sometimes have short briefs under the heading “AfterMarket.”
The one I’m looking at is headlined “Neutral Tandem Soars on Q4
Results.” It notes that “telecom gear maker Neutral Tandem gapped up
11% in more than seven times average volume” and then quotes what ana-

lysts are saying. When these tidbits of unusual activity catch my attention,
I’ll check them out on my computer and view a chart to see how the stock
really looks.
You never know how many ideas you’re going to pick up from reading
IBD. But in each issue, there will be several you’ll want to check out. It
takes no time at all to go to your PC, punch in the symbol that appears in the
paper right alongside the first mention of the company’s name, and check
into the history of the stock, its earnings, and a few other key basics. Some
of the best portfolio managers in the country quickly check out stocks this
way to decide which companies they want to focus on or get more informa-
tion about. It’s a good way to add to your watch list.
Mutual Funds & ETFs
On the first page of the “Mutual Funds & ETFs” section, there are two
information boxes I usually check. They zero in on growth funds with excel-
lent records. The boxes show these funds’ largest holdings in the latest quar-
ter, along with their top new buys and sells. New buys may be of interest.
We also show how the funds have performed relative to the market in each
of the last five years. After you’ve taken the paper for a while, you’ll know
which are the better funds. One way you can judge is by noting their top
positions. If the fund has three or four of the better leaders, I know the
managers really know what they’re doing.
I don’t normally look at our mutual fund tables, but I will frequently
check one or two fund families that I know are outstanding to get a feel of
how they’re doing. We cover far more funds and include more data in our
tables than most daily publications. Many papers have sharply cut the num-

ber of funds they follow. Besides current activity, we include the four-week
percentage change and a 36-month performance ranking for each fund. We
also include the phone number for each fund family.
A couple of tables in the fund section are unique. One shows how big-cap
growth funds are doing compared with small-cap growth funds. The other
compares growth funds to value funds. This is important for you to know in
any market: Are growth stocks leading, or are value stocks? Are big caps
leading, or are small caps? Here you have the answers at a glance. In the
edition I have, growth is leading.
Leading Fund Sectors
You also need to know the broad, overall sectors that are in demand. So, on
Fridays we have two tables showing the top industry and sector funds. On
other days, different fund types are displayed. If you’re interested in what
industries are doing well, you can see here that gold has been doing well in

the last 4-week, 8-week, 12-week, and 16-week periods. The medical field
shows well in the longer, 39-week table.
Issues & Insights
At the back of the first section, you’ll find our editorial pages, titled “Issues &
Insights.” We have an outstanding staff of a half-dozen highly experienced
writers turning out up to six editorials a day. I do not write these. Wes Mann,
our distinguished and talented editor, who has been with IBD from the
beginning, is in charge of this key area and is assisted in the important role it
plays for IBD readers and the nation by Terry Jones, who has also been with
IBD since its start-up 25 years ago. Terry came to us from BusinessWeek. I’ll
normally read two or three of the editorials after checking the headlines and
summary paragraphs to see if I’m interested in the subject.
We also have columns from guest writers plus syndicated columnists “On
the Left” and “On the Right,” so you get different points of view. On the
right, I always respect the work of Thomas Sowell and Victor Davis Hanson.
Both are older, experienced observers with great insight. Sowell, from Stan-
ford’s Hoover Institute, is probably the best economist and historian in
America. He has a new book just out entitled Applied Economics: Thinking
beyond Stage One, one of 42 books he has written. From Washington, we
run columns by conservative Charles Krauthammer and liberal David
Ignatius, who is well informed on international issues.
But the first thing I look at each day in “Issues & Insights” is the cartoon.
We have the best editorial cartoonist in the nation, Michael Ramirez. He
won a Pulitzer Prize for Investor’s Business Dailyin 2008—the second time
he had received this prestigious award.
IBD also has an extensive public polling operation, conducting monthly
surveys on economic confidence, presidential leadership, and major
national issues year-round and daily tracking polls in election years. In 2008,
for the second presidential election in a row, the IBD/TIPP poll not only
came closest to the final margin between Barack Obama and John McCain,
but was right on the money. These feats, tantamount to hitting a bullet with
a bullet, have earned the IBD/TIPP poll, conducted by TechnoMetrica
Market Intelligence, the honor of being America’s most accurate.
Making Money
In the “Making Money” section, starting on page B1, we try to cover the rel-
evant facts, skills, and rules you need if you are to be a successful investor.
We view Investor’s Business Dailyas an educational medium. We don’t tell
people what to buy. We don’t recommend stocks or tout “10 stocks that are
going to go up tomorrow.” We just explain time-tested rules based on mod-

els of successful stocks in all of past history and provide sound techniques
and methods for managing your portfolio wisely.
We also give classes and several levels of paid workshops, from beginning
to very advanced, on investing; in addition, we have a chart school, have sev-
eral books out, including this fourth edition of the one you’re reading, and
offer a home study course. We view our mission as being to teach anyone
who wants to learn how to become a better investor and protect himself so
he doesn’t get hurt in bear markets.
NYSE + Nasdaq Stocks On The Move
The first thing I read on page B1 is the “NYSE + Nasdaq Stocks On The
Move” tables—a feature that’s in no other publication. We have a massive
computer database that each day screens for those stocks that had the great-
est increase in trading volume over and above their average daily volume in
the last three months. This isolates the true demand for securities you
would not otherwise notice. On these lists, you’ll find many new, innovative
companies with names you may not know. But if they appear frequently,
you’d better find out what they’re doing or making. They could be the next
Microsoft or Apple.
In this current issue, Visa is on the NYSE list. It was up 4.6 points on a
volume increase to 239% more than normal for the credit card company.
Visa just reported earnings during a bearish period. There were also a few
medical stocks on the lists.
In addition to price and volume change, the tables show the same com-
pany variables IBD shows in its main stock tables. For example, IBD shows
the Earnings per Share rank of Visa as 99, meaning its earnings growth rate
in the last three years and in recent quarters puts it in the top 1% of all com-
panies in our database. This doesn’t mean the stock’s going to go up. But it
certainly means it has characteristics worth checking if you’re hunting for
entrepreneurial stocks that might outperform in a future better market.
We boldface those names on this list that have Earnings per Share and
Relative Strength ratings of 80 or higher, meaning they’re in the top 20% of
all stocks based on those measurements. The stocks with stronger records
are the ones you want to investigate.
Below the list of stocks that advanced for the day is a list of stocks that
were down in price. They too are ranked by percentage increase in volume.
You can judge the market environment and how well our new government
is doing by how many stocks are on the upside versus how many are on the
downside. In the example shown, the table has eight NYSE stocks on the
upside versus 36 on the downside, meaning there were more stocks that day
with greater-than-normal volume that dropped in price than that increased

in price. This zeroes in on the daily supply and demand for leading securi-
ties. It was a bearish day.
I’ve found this computer screen to be valuable. For it to fail to pick up a
new big leader is almost impossible. But you’ve got to do your own home-
work to understand some of these names you might not know. IBD also tries
to cover these companies in our various columns.
How’s The Market?
Page B2 is titled “How’s The Market?” It is loaded with absolutely crucial
data. We present the four key general market indexes—the NYSE compos-
ite, Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrials—in large, easy-to-read
charts. We stack them one on top of the other so you can compare them and
see which indexes are stronger and if one index diverges from the others at
some point. At this time, we note that while all the indexes were in a nega-
tive trend in January, the Nasdaq was down only 2%, less than the others,
implying it is the leader at this stage in a difficult market.

We also have relative strength lines, moving average lines, and a line just
below the NYSE Composite chart that displays the New York Stock
Exchange advance-decline line, which let’s you quickly see day by day over
the last six months if more stocks on the NYSE were advancing or declining.
There’s even an Accumulation/Distribution measure showing which of the
major indexes has the largest amount of accumulation. At this reading, the
Nasdaq had a “B–,” meaning it has recently enjoyed stronger accumulation
than the others.
B2 is a page I look at every day, and you should too. I want to carefully
check the recent price and critical volume activity of the leading indexes on
a day-by-day basis to see if they’re still in an uptrend and under accumula-
tion or if they’re shifting into a new downtrend and behaving in a highly neg-
ative way. Don’t neglect the daily volume; it’s the key that can tell if you
something is going wrong. If you study and learn to interpret the general
market indexes correctly, which can take some time, you will learn how to
avoid most of the serious declines because the increased distribution always
shows up in the early stages, before the more damaging part of a decline
evolves. This can preserve a good bit more of your money and is something
it’s definitely worth striving to perfect, no matter how much time it may take
you. How much time, after all, did you spend earning the money you now
hope to invest? So is it worth your time to learn how to skillfully preserve
and protect it?
If you learn to read the market and apply IBD’s general market rules,
there’s no excuse for finding that you are down 30%, 40%, or 50% or more
in any bear market. I know most public investors and maybe some readers
of the paper were possibly hurt in the market correction of 2008. But IBD
supplied the rules and information. If readers did their homework and read
the “The Big Picture” column, they should have seen that IBD’s method
picked up the adverse activity in the earlier stages of the emerging bear
market decline that developed in late 2000 and 2008.
You Can and Must Learn to Spot the Following
October 3, 2007, was the first distribution day on the Nasdaq, October 11
was the second, October 15 and 16 were the third and fourth, and October
19 was the fifth. If you saw and read this correctly, you would have sold
something. On October 24 you had a sixth distribution day, and you should
have cut back further. By November 1, you had had seven crucial warnings.
This is how all important market corrections and bear markets begin. If you
missed this and were totally unaware of what was happening, go back and
study all the market-top charts in Chapter 9 until they make sense to you
and you understand what you must look for in the future. Many investors

have discovered they need to take charge, get serious, and learn the basics
of sound, successful investing. You can do far better in the future.
IBD Mutual Fund Index
There is another unique feature on page B2 you can’t find in other daily
publications—the “IBD Mutual Fund Index,” where we pick two dozen
leading growth funds and show their composite performance in a graphic
display. I use this as a supplementary index because it is in a way a giant
advance-decline line of some of the better funds with a combined 1,000 to
2,000 or more stocks owned among the 24 funds. When I’ve seen a classic,
well-formed cup-with-handle pattern in this index, preceded by a strong
prior uptrend to the pattern, the index and the market have almost always
moved up.
IBD’s 197 Industry Sub-Group Rankings
On this jam-packed page, we also have IBD’s “197 Industry Sub-Group
Rankings.” This list shows a composite rating for each sub-group and
each sub-group’s change from the previous day, plus where the group
ranked three and six weeks and seven months ago. The top 20 and bottom
20 sub-groups are circled because they represent the best- and worst-
performing industries.
By now, you should know I am not going to own anything in the bottom
20 because we’ve proven over many years that these industries are going to
be having a lot of trouble. On the other hand, we know that most of the lead-
ing areas of a positive market will show up in the top 20.

The reason we have 197 subgroups is that within every sector, there are
segments that can perform quite differently. Medical genetics is our third-
ranking group. Seven months ago it was fifty-seventh.
All told, we have 10 tables that measure industries from different points
of view. Two small boxes on page B2 that I also check each day give you
another perspective on which industries are leading. One shows the “Top 10
Fidelity Industry Funds Since Jan. 1.”
The second small box shows the groups with the highest percentage of
stocks at new highs. With several different ways to look at market sectors,
you can hardly miss the one or two sectors that turn out to be the real lead-
ers in each new bull market.
Next to those boxes, there’s a list displaying indexes of 28 different mar-
ket sectors and how each performed for the day.
IBD Industry Themes
On page B3, we have another way of keeping track of industries—a daily
column called “IBD Industry Themes.” In every market, there are certain
leading themes. Investors may be buying medical stocks, for example, or
technology stocks. So what are the themes in the current market?
We also have a column on New York and Nasdaq stocks and one for the
long-term investor. Another three columns (on page B5) include “The Base
Reader,” which analyzes various chart patterns, “The Income Investor,” and
“International Leaders,” covering the foreign markets. I don’t read all these

umn is talking about some situation I’m interested in, I’ll read it.
2,500 Leading Stocks (NYSE + Nasdaq Research Tables)
A powerhouse element we’ve added recently is the way we organize and dis-
play our one-of-a-kind stock tables. We call them “Research Tables”
because we have a boatload of data on each company. IBD follows up to
2,500 stocks, combining New York and Nasdaq stocks in one table, whereas
some of our competitors carry only 1,000 stocks and have nothing close to
the critical ratings and data we provide for each company.
Right off the bat, you’ll see that our “2,500 Leading Stocks” tables
starting on page B3 are organized in order of the strongest of 33 broad
economic sectors. Almost everyone else’s tables are organized alphabeti-
cally. For decades, Americans used the stock tables in their local newspa-
per or in one of our financial competitors just to look up where their
stocks closed yesterday: “Was my General Motors up, or was it down?”
While it’s nice to be able to check how your stock did, these days you can
get quotes anywhere on the Web. What we’re doing is making the tables
an advanced research lab to help you discover the next big leading stock
you’ll want to invest in. Here’s what we’re able to do with how wedisplay
the tables.
This particular issue confirms what we saw in other tables: that the “Med-
ical” sector is number one. Then we show every one of the stocks in the
medical field, listed alphabetically. Each has a composite rating, which goes
from 0 to 99, with 99 being the very best. This is an overall rating that con-
siders key individual ratings. (Of course, this current rating could decline if

our government succeeds in its attempt to rewrite all the rules and decide
how it wants to run our entire medical system.)
If you spot a stock that looks interesting, we have given you the stock sym-
bol, and you can go to Investors.com and check out the chart or other vital
facts and figures, using a handy checklist to flesh out what you’ve uncovered
in the tables.
As I scan the tables, I look for stocks that are boldfaced. Here, too, we
boldface anything that’s up one point or more or is making a new high in
price. I’m mainly interested in keeping track of price movements so I don’t
miss anything that might turn out to be a huge new leader. The boldfaced
stocks can be scanned very quickly, and if you’re using charts, you may
already be aware of the patterns of some of the ideas you notice in the
tables. For example, if you go through a number of charts every week, look-
ing for sound patterns with strong fundamentals, and you scan the bold-
faced stocks in the tables daily, you’ll see a bolded stock whose chart you
were impressed with start to move up.
When I spot unusual activity by high-ranked stocks, I tend to write down
the symbol at the top of the B1 page. When I get through scanning the
tables, I may have eight or ten symbols that I’ll check out because they look
interesting based on their price activity and high ratings. You can go right to
Investors.com or Daily Graphs Online and evaluate the chart to see if the
stock is acting right or acting poorly.
So rather than using the tables just to find out how my stocks did yester-
day, I’m using them to screen for potential ideas that might become super
leaders at some point in the future. For any serious investor, this is almost a
necessity if you are going to improve your performance.
“You Can Do It Too”
At the top of page B4, we have something called “You Can Do It Too.”
These are short quotes by investors who have written to tell us they’ve done
well and what their main observations were. I realize there are a number of
people who probably aren’t so successful or who haven’t done their home-
work, didn’t follow rules, or didn’t have any system. Many of these quotes,
however, are inspiring.
It’s interesting that more than 1,000 people have written to tell us that
they’ve finally figured out how to put it all together to achieve outstand-
ing results. I say “finally” because it takes some time and effort to get
truly superior results. There are no free lunches in the stock market. But
once you understand and apply yourself, you could in time become
financially independent. Would that be a worthy goal for you to strive for
and achieve?

“Stocks in the News”
A section that I also check every day is what I call the “mini-charts” in the
“NYSE Stocks in the News” and “Nasdaq Stocks in the News” sections. We
used to show 20 or more charts in this screen, but we’ve now limited it to 10
because we’ve refined and improved the sorting mechanism. And what
we’ve learned is that, once you’re in any future bull market, these two lists
will materially outperform the S&P 500 and any new names on the charts
will be well worth your checking.
If you’re in a bear market, don’t expect these lists to work. Three out of
every four stocks will be going down in such an environment, and growth
situations can have significant corrections. But if you know you’re in an
uptrending market, and this is confirmed by the “The Big Picture” column,
these mini-charts—each of which is packed with 20 key statistics—can be a
source of high-probability new ideas. They won’t all work. But when you’re
in a positive market, you follow up on the ideas that work. Sooner or later, if
you’re patient, a market will develop into a strong bull market. And when
that happens, these are definitely screens you want to check out thoroughly.
If you do your homework, you then have a better chance of materially
improving your performance.
Over time, I’ve found that the first six or seven sectors in our stock
tables will contain most of the new leaders. I’ve also found that just

because some of the sectors in the back half haven’t been leaders recently
doesn’t mean that some of them won’t later possibly become turnarounds.
Lower-ranked and poor-performing sectors in this issue are Computer—
Hardware, Savings & Loans, Apparel, Machinery, Media, Steel, Real
Estate, and Semiconductors.
These rankings can shift over a period of weeks or months. But it pays to
know what’s leading now and which names within each sector have the best
fundamental and market-action variables. That’s where you want to concen-
trate your research.
These tables may take a little time to get used to. But after a few weeks,
you’ll know where your stocks are listed. To make it easier, we also have a
table that lists all of IBD’s 197 subindustries and tells you which of the 33
broad sectors each subindustry belongs to.
One thing that most of us fail to do, but that I would highly encourage you
to do, is read the box (usually on page B7) that explains the various ratings
and measures and how they’re computed and used. By doing this, you will
understand how best to utilize these advanced, very sophisticated tables
that could hold the key to dramatic success or improvement in your future.
Below the how-to-read box is a short list of “do’s and don’ts”—in other
words, what you should be doing to avoid the classic errors people some-
times make when they’re investing without doing their due diligence.
IBD Timesaver Table
The “IBD Timesaver Table” on the same page is a feature many busy peo-
ple like to use because it picks up all the high-ranking stocks that were up or
down in price in a short table that includes volume and some other rankings.
I always check this and take particular note of the “Stocks Down” list. I want
to be aware of the stocks that have been hit hard because this could affect
others in the same industry. If a stock shows up repeatedly on this list, it
could be that it has topped and is headed for more trouble.
I’ve mentioned that we have 10 different ways you can zero in on the
leading groups. We also have little sector charts under the heading “Lead-
ing Market Indexes.” Each has a daily price and volume chart. Hi-tech,
Junior Growth, Leisure, and Consumer Sectors now top the list.
Alongside, we have the “New Highs” list. This list has also been reorga-
nized. We weren’t interested in just showing which stocks made new highs
and which made new lows. We list them in order of the industry sectors that
had the largest number of stocks making new price highs. When you get into
a strong bull market and find that, say, the medical sector continues to lead,
it will probably be among the top one, two, or three sectors with the most
stocks making new highs.

When high technology was leading in the bull market of the 1990s, the
computer sector was number one for a year and a half. Stocks like Cisco and
Dell were constantly on the new-high list. If you knew what you were look-
ing for, and you understood the significance of a stock’s displaying new highs
in a bull market, maybe you too could have participated when these stocks
were going up 10 times or more. There’s a lot you can learn by studying past
markets. We are historians.
In other words, it’s hard notto notice the real action and the real leaders
in the market. They are as obvious as the elephant that jumps into the bath-
tub and splatters water all over the place. When a whole sector is moving,
the sheer volume and broad-based activity cannot be hidden. We saw this in
the energy sector from 2004 to 2007, when virtually all oil and gas stocks
were moving up dramatically.
At some point, all sectors change. And when they do, the 10 different
ways we have to pick up leaders and laggards will point you in a direction
where you can say, “Those stocks are no longer leading the way they did
before.” If you just go on emotions and your attachment to a stock, you can
get into a lot of trouble. You need precise measurements to tell you if this
sector or that security is really behaving properly.

One last thing: earnings are what drive a stock, and the rate of earnings
improvement is more important than the P/E ratio. So, you want to make
sure you check the “Company Earnings Reports” that come out at certain
times during a quarter. You can discover a company that’s suddenly showing
much better earnings than in the past.
It helps to be up on stocks that come through with better-than-expected
earnings—what the Street refers to as “earnings surprises.” What we have
learned to watch for are stocks whose earnings estimates are constantly
being raised and that show an acceleration in their percentage rate of
increase in earnings quarter by quarter. As a mentioned earlier, the bigger
the earnings increase, the better. And we don’t fall into the trap of eliminat-
ing any stock just because it’s P/E ratio looks high.
To wrap up the paper, we cover more futures and options than most pub-
lications. There’s a column on the bond market, several interest-rate charts
and tables, and no fewer than 36 charts on commodities futures.

utes each day or you’re investing full-time, you can develop an effective
routine that fits your schedule using the tools and features found on
Investors.com.
We discussed the ways Investor’s Business Daily starts the research
process with an efficient assessment of the market, industry groups, and
stocks. Here are some additional ways to dig deeper in your research with
IBD’s specially designed screening tools and charts.
If you’re reading this book to hone your investing skills, going through
these tools in the following manner will help you develop an easy daily sys-
tem for reviewing the market, top industries, and, finally, the top stocks.
The IBD Stock Research Tool on the home page of Investors.com is
structured to let you do just that from one central location. As you can see
from the graphic on this tool, you can use it to follow “Market Direction”
and to “Find,” “Evaluate,” and “Track” leading stocks. Following this
approach will help you find the best stocks, will let you know the right time
to buy and sell, and could materially improve your results.
The key is to take some time to become familiar with the investing tools
and features on Investors.com. The CAN SLIM chapters in this book will
help you understand the rationale for IBD’s investing tools, which are pro-
grammed to search for companies with the performance characteristics typ-
ical of emerging stock market winners.
Market Direction
As discussed, three out of four stocks usually follow the overall market
trend, whether it’s up or down. That’s why it’s critical for you to learn to fol-
low, not fight, the market. Within the “Market Direction” tab, you’ll find
links to features that will help you do just that.
Start by taking another look at the “The Big Picture” and “Market Pulse”
to see what stage the market is currently in. You can also click on the
“Indexes” link to view the latest charts for each of the major indexes. The
charts are updated throughout the trading day with a 20-minute delay.
For timely analysis of the market action as it happens, read the “Markets
Update,” featuring nine intraday reports. You’ll find concise insights that
put the day’s events into perspective, plus highlights of leading stocks mak-
ing a big move.
IBD TV: “Market Wrap” Regularly watching the IBD “Market Wrap” video is
another good way to stay on top of the market and improve your analytical
skills at the same time. Available by 6:30 p.m. (EST) each trading day, this
short video uses charts to visually show you how the market and leading
stocks are acting, and what trends and potential buy points to look out for.

How I Use IBD to Find Potential Winning Stocks
Find Stocks
Once you’ve reviewed the current market conditions, use the “Find Stocks”
tab to look for new investing ideas. Here you’ll find a wide range of idea-
generating screens in addition to those in the IBD print edition.
“Stocks on the Move™”—Learn What the Institutions May Be Buying and Selling as It Happens This is the
online version of the IBD print edition feature. As we’ve mentioned earlier,
just looking at typical most-active lists won’t give you the whole picture. You
need to know about the emerging institutional trades that are beginning to
show promise.
These stocks will appear on this radar screen, which is updated continu-
ously throughout the trading day. You can quickly spot the stocks that insti-
tutions may be moving into—or out of—in a major way as it happens.
Remember that institutional buyers who are taking a position in a stock usu-
ally buy in huge quantities, which may create major volume in the stock.
Nearly every winning stock will show this type of activity at the onset of
its price advance. You don’t want to miss this screen if you are searching for
emerging leaders. Remember that not all the stocks shown on this list will
be winners. It’s important to check further to make sure the stock’s chart
looks sound and the ratings show leadership potential. This is a good way to
spot the breakout of a stock as it is happening or shortly thereafter.
Intraday Volume Percent Change—Another Way to Spot Possible Winners A key element of the online
version of “Stocks on the Move” is the intradayvolume percent change. As
we’ve seen, a stock needs support from institutional buying to propel it
further. Volume percentage changes on an intraday basis will tell you—as it
is happening—if a stock is trading above or below its average daily volume
of the last 50 trading days. That’s a sign of institutional buying (or selling)
and a key component of “Stocks on the Move.” You can also get the intraday
volume percent change for any stock you’re looking at on the “Stock
Quotes” page of Investors.com.
“Screen Center” Click on the “Screen Center ” link to pull up the latest “Screen of
the Day.” Each day, there’s a different list that sorts the entire stock database
looking for potentially superior stocks based on important performance criteria.
This is a quick way to find leaders and the better possible ideas in differ-
ent categories. The rotating screens include categories such as “Top Rela-
tive Price Strength Stocks,” “SmartSelectAll Stars,” and “Top Acceleration
in Earnings.”
To access additional stock lists, click on “Screen Center” in the drop-down
menu within the “Stock Research” tab on the Investors.com home page.

You’ll find more possible investing ideas from lists including “CAN SLIM
Select,” “Sector Leaders,” “Tech Leaders,” and “Long-Term Investor.”
Most Active—NYSE and Nasdaq This daily column (also found in the print edition)
highlights breakouts and basing patterns in the best institutional-quality
stocks experiencing unusually heavy trading volume. You’ll also find a
discussion of potential buy points that indicate the best time to make initial
and secondary purchases. This column will also flag potentially negative
action as stocks reach their peaks.
Evaluate Stocks
Next, let’s look at how you can evaluate any stocks you already own or are
thinking of buying. There are many questions that should first be answered:
• Is this the right stock to own? Or are there better ones in its group?
• Is the stock in a leading industry group or a laggard one?
• If you own the stock, have you held it too long?
• If the stock looks fundamentally strong and you want to invest in it, is it
too soon or too late?
• Are we in a bull market or a bear market?
These are just a few questions that need to be answered before you make
your move. Two IBDinvesting tools—“IBDStock Checkup®
” and “IBDCharts”—will help you sort through the stock-picking puzzle.
“IBD Stock Checkup®” “IBD Stock Checkup” evaluates and compares more than
6,000 publicly traded companies and assigns a composite rating and a pass,
neutral, or fail grade to put your ideas in the proper perspective. It’s essentially
a statistical summary report made up of several components, including
• Composite Rating
• Performance Within Group
• Group Leaders
• IBDStock Checklist—with a pass, neutral, or fail grade
•
Red Light, Green Light
For the composite rating and most of the components listed in “IBD Stock
Checkup,” you’ll see a green (pass), yellow (neutral), or red (fail) icon. This is a
quick and easy way to see if your stock passes muster in that particular cate-
gory based on time-tested CAN SLIM criteria.

Composite Rating As we discussed earlier, the composite rating is a quick way to
know whether you should move ahead or not. With the color-coded icons
within the “IBD Stock Checklist” (see point__ in the chart), it’s like a traffic
light that tells you whether to go (green), slow down (yellow), or stop (red)
in your research, and it will guide you toward only the very best companies.
Performance Within Group—Buy the Best Stocks in the Top Groups In the “Performance Within
Group” section, you can see how the stock specifically performs against the
rest of the stocks in its industry group. The rankings are based on IBD
SmartSelectratings. This will help you determine if you’re making the right
choices. It’s easy to be swayed by news or TV tips, but this should give you a
major edge by forcing you to stick to the facts.
Group Leaders—Pointing You toward Real Potential Leadership No matter what you’ve bought or
are thinking about buying, this screen shows you where the real leadership
is. These are the stocks exhibiting the type of performance that might
propel them further in an uptrending general market You can click on each
of the SmartSelectratings to see which stocks in the group rank highest for
that individual rating.
“IBD Stock Checklist” Is Your Stock Rated Pass, Neutral, or Fail? The “IBD Stock Checklist”
gives you a thorough review of the fundamental and technical strength of
each stock, along with a pass, neutral, or fail grade for each category. For
example, at the very top of the stock checklist, you’ll see a green, yellow, or
red icon next to the composite rating. This will help steer you toward the
true market leaders—and away from the laggards.
In the “General Market and Industry Group” section, you’ll also get a
pass, neutral, or fail grade for the general market and for the relevant indus-
try group. Do not buy stocks when the general market flashes a red signal.
IBD Charts Show You the Right Time to Buy or Sell You never want to buy any highly rated
stock in IBD’s tables without first checking a chart, and it pays to regularly
review both daily and weekly charts on any stocks you own. This is a vital
step that will help you spot emerging trends and track a stock’s movement
so you know the exact time to buy or sell. IBD charts are designed to make
it easier and faster for both new and experienced chart readers to get the
real picture. These daily and weekly charts are free when you register on
Investors.com.
For those who are intimidated by charts, think of a stock chart as a “pic-
ture worth a thousand words.” It will tell you some vital things about the
progress (or lack of progress) of any company. In time, you will find your

review is quite automatic. Daily charts can also help you spot possible future
winners. IBDdaily charts include the following:
• Up days in price in blue; down days in red
• Continually updated price and volume data
• EPS and RS ratings
• Relative Price Strength line
• 50- and 200-day moving averages of price
Refer again to Chapter 2 to learn to recognize chart patterns. You may also
want to consult the “IBD University” section of Investors.com for a course
on chart analysis. Also remember that the majority of stocks tend to follow
the overall trend of the market, so be sure to check current market condi-
tions, as discussed earlier, to confirm that your overall timing is correct.
Weekly Charts—Tip-Off to Institutional Trading IBD weekly charts will help you gauge
institutional buying. Since mutual funds typically take days, if not weeks

(and sometimes longer), to build (or unload) their positions, any heavy
volume on the chart may tell you if they’re possibly moving into or out of a
stock in a major way.
Weekly charts include the same information that appears on the daily
charts, with the addition of shares outstanding. These charts span nearly two
years of price and volume movements.
To capture the biggest gains, it’s important that you use both daily and
weekly charts, since they offer different views on a stock. You will get more
exact timing indications from the dailies and the big picture from the weeklies.
Track Stocks
Once you’ve evaluated and purchased a stock, it’s crucial that you track its per-
formance. “Buy and hold” is a dangerous strategy, as allstocks—even those of
well-known, established companies—can be volatile and risky. To be a suc-
cessful investor over the long haul, you need to keep all your losses small and
to know when to sell and take your profits. Chapters 10 and 11 discuss how
you can do that with time-tested sell rules. The “My Stock Lists” feature on
Investors.com will help you stay organized so you can apply them effectively.
“My Stock Lists” With “My Stock Lists,” you can create up to five lists with
up to 50 stocks on each list. To stay organized and save time, you can

create different lists for different purposes. For example, you could
create a “My Portfolio” list for the stocks you own, a list of “Stocks in
Bases” for leading stocks that are currently forming a base, and a “Near
a Buy Point” list for stocks that are approaching a proper buy point. It’s
important that you review and manage your lists regularly, adding and
deleting stocks as needed.
To help you track the performance of your stocks, the “My Biggest Price
Movers” feature automatically alerts you to the stocks on your lists that are
making the biggest price moves, up or down.
“My Stock Lists” also gives you one-click access to “IBD Stock
Checkup,” IBDcharts, and IBDarchives for each stock. Use IBDarchives
to read what IBDhas written about the companies you’re watching; it can
provide valuable insight into the story behind the stock. Use “IBD Stock
Checkup” and IBDcharts to continually evaluate both the stocks you own
and those you’re watching.

Watching the Market
and Reacting to News
Tape Reading Is Emotional
Ticker tape watching or being glued to your PC or watching the market on a TV
channel all day can get dangerously emotional. Sometimes a stock keeps rising
to the point where everyone—including you—is convinced it’s going “straight
through the roof.” That’s when discipline is most needed because the stock is
probably topping. When a stock’s merits are so obvious that it looks fantastic to
everyone, you can be sure almost everyone who can buy it has already done so.
Remember, majority opinion is rarely right in the stock market.
Winners in the stock market need perspective, discipline, and self-con-
trol above all else. Those who continually sit in front of the moving ticker
tape that shows many stocks as they change prices or their PC monitoring
hundreds of stocks changing prices, risk making emotional decisions.
Is the Stock in a Base or Is It Too Extended?
There’s an easy way to keep your head if you’re keeping your eye on the tape
or on your PC.
When you see activity that impresses you, always refer to a weekly chart
to see if the stock is building a base or if it is extended too far past its buy or
pivot point. If it is extended, leave it alone; it’s too late. Chasing stocks, like
crime, doesn’t pay.
If the stock is building a base, then apply the CAN SLIM system. Are cur-
rent earnings up a meaningful amount? Is the three-year earnings record
good? Have you checked all the other CAN SLIM criteria?

Watching the Market and Reacting to News
More than half the stocks that look inviting on the tape will fail the
CAN SLIM test and prove to be deficient, mediocre investments. However,
sooner or later, convincing market action will point you to a golden oppor-
tunity that meets all your criteria for a possible star performer.
Scan Chart Books Weekly
and List Buy Points
Another way to use the tape or market action productively is to review a
comprehensive chart book every week and make a list of stocks that meet
your technical and fundamental selection criteria. Then jot down the buy
point at which you would consider buying each stock. Also note the average
daily volume for each stock on your prospect list so that you can easily ver-
ify any noteworthy increases in volume.
Keep this shopping list with you every day for the next couple of weeks as
you watch the market. In time, one or two of the stocks on your list will
begin to approach your buy point. This is the time to get ready to buy—
when the stock trades at your buy point, you anticipate the day’s volume will
be at least 50% above average and the general market direction is positive.
The more demand there is for a stock at the buy point, the better.
Tape and market watchers expect the pace of activity to slow down
around lunchtime in New York (12 p.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern). They also know
the market frequently shows its true colors in the last hour of the day, either
coming on and closing strong, or suddenly weakening and failing to hold the
gains established earlier in the session.
Don’t Buy on Tips and Rumors
I never buy stocks on tips, rumors, or inside information. Doing so simply
isn’t sound. Of course, tips, rumors, and inside information are what most
people are looking for. However, I should remind you again that what most
people believe and do in the market doesn’t work very well. Beware of
falling into the typical market traps.
Certain advisory services and columns in some business newspapers are
fed by Street gossip, rumors, and tips, along with planted personal opinions
or inside information. These services and columns, in my opinion, are
unprofessional and unsophisticated. There are far sounder and safer meth-
ods of gathering information.
Bernard Baruch stressed the importance of separating the facts of a situ-
ation from tips, “inside dope,” and wishful thinking. One of his rules was to
beware of barbers, beauticians, waiters, or anyone else bearing such gifts.

Watch for Distortion around the End of the Year and in Early January
A certain amount of distortion can occur in optionable stocks around option
expiration dates. There’s also a significant amount of year-end distortion in
stocks during December and sometimes through January and early February.
Year-end is a tricky time for anyone to buy stock, since numerous trades
are based on tax considerations. Many low-grade losers will suddenly seem
strong, while former leaders lie idle or start to correct. In time, this mis-
leading activity dissipates and the true leaders reemerge.
General market sell-offs also occasionally start after the beginning of a
new year, which further adds to the difficulty. Fake-out action can occur
with one big “up” day followed by a big “down” day, only to be followed by
another big “up” day. There are times when I’d rather take a vacation in Jan-
uary. The January effect, where small- and mid-cap stocks get a boost dur-
ing January, can be a misleading and spurious indicator. At best, it “works”
for only a brief period.
It’s important that you stick with your rules and don’t get sidetracked by
questionable, less-reliable indicators, of which there are many.
Interpret and React to Major News
When domestic or foreign news of consequence hits the street, capable
market sleuths are sometimes less concerned with whether the news is good
or bad than they are with analyzing its effect on the market. For example, if
the news appears to be bad but the market yawns, you can feel more posi-
tive. The tape is telling you that the underlying market may be stronger than
many people believe. On the other hand, if highly positive news hits the
market and stocks give ground slightly, the tape analyst might conclude the
underpinnings of the market are weaker than previously believed.
Sometimes the market overreacts to or even counteracts favorable or dis-
appointing news. On Wednesday, November 9, 1983, someone ran a full-
page ad in the Wall Street Journalpredicting rampant inflation and another
1929-type depression. The ad appeared during the middle of an intermedi-
ate correction in the market, but its warnings were so overblown that the
market immediately rebounded and rallied for several days.
There’s also a difference between a market that retreats in the face of
news that’s scary but easy to understand and explain, and one that slumps
noticeably on no apparent news at all.
Experienced market investigators have long memories. They keep records
of past major news events and how the market reacted. The list would include
President Eisenhower’s heart attack, the Cuban missile crisis, the Kennedy

assassination, an outbreak of war, the Arab oil embargo, expectations of gov-
ernment actions such as wage and price controls, 9/11, war in the Mideast
and, more recently, in early September 2008, when subprime real estate news
got worse and the market expected a very liberal president to be elected.
Old News versus New News
After it’s been repeated several times, both good news and bad news
become old news.
Old news will often have the opposite effect on the stock market from
what it had when the news first broke.
This, of course, is the opposite of how propaganda and disinformation
work in totalitarian dictator-controlled countries. There, the more often a lie
or distortion is repeated to the masses, the more it may become accepted as
truth. Here, when news becomes widely known or anticipated, it’s “dis-
counted” by experienced individuals in the marketplace, blunting the effect
of its release—unless, of course, the news keeps getting worse than expected.
To market neophytes, news can be paradoxical and confusing. For exam-
ple, when a company releases a bad quarterly earnings report, its stock may
go up in price when this is reported. When this occurs, it’s often because the
news was known or anticipated ahead of time, and a few professionals may
decide to buy or to cover short sales once all the bad news is finally out. “Buy
on bad news” is what some wily institutions use as a guide. Others believe
they should step in and provide support for their large positions at difficult
times.
Analyzing Our National News Media
How the national news is edited and presented or suppressed dramatically
affects the economy and public confidence. It can also influence public
opinion of the government, elections, our presidents, and our stock market.
Several excellent books have been written on the subject of analyzing our
national news. Humphrey Neill, author of the 1931 classic Tape Reading
and Market Tactics, also wrote The Art of Contrary Opinion. It carefully
examines the way identical news stories are reported quite differently in the
headlines of different newspapers and how that can be misleading to stock
owners and the public. Neill developed contrarian theories based on how
frequently conventional wisdom or consensus opinion expressed in the
national media turns out to be ill-conceived or just plain wrong.
In 1976, media expert Bruce Herschensohn wrote The Gods of Antenna,
which tells how some TV networks manipulate the news to influence public

opinion. Another book on the subject is The Coming Battle for the Media,
written in 1988 by William Rusher.
One of the most outstanding studies on the subject is The Media Elite,
written by Stanley Rothman and Robert Lichter in 1986. Rothman and
Lichter interviewed 240 journalists and top staffers at three major newspa-
pers (the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington
Post), three news magazines (Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World
Report), and the news departments of four TV networks (ABC, CBS, NBC
and PBS). On average, 85% of these top national journalists were found to
be liberal and to have voted the Democratic ticket in national elections in
1964, 1968, 1972 and 1976. Another survey showed only 6% of national
journalists to have voted Republican.
A Freedom Forum poll reinforced The Media Elitewhen it documented
that 89%—9 out of 10—of Washington reporters and bureau chiefs voted
for Clinton in 1992 and 7% voted for the first George Bush.
More recently, Tim Groseclose of UCLA and Stanford and Jeff Milyo of
the University of Chicago published “A Measure of Media Bias.” They
counted the number of times a news outlet quoted certain think tanks and
compared this with the number of times members of Congress cited the
same think tanks when speaking from the floor.
Comparing the citation patterns enabled them to construct an ADA
(Americans for Democratic Action) score for each media outlet. They found
that Fox News Special Report was the only right-of center news outlet in
their sample. The most liberal was CBS Evening Newsfollowed by the New
York Times, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, NBC Nightly News, and
ABC’s World News Tonight.
More surprising was the astonishing degree to which the mainstream
media in these surveys are much more liberal than the general voting public.
In the 1984 presidential election, Mondale vs. Reagan, the ABC, CBS, and
NBC prime-time news programs from Labor Day to Election Day were taped
and dissected by Maura Clancy and Michael Robinson. They focused only on
reports in which spin for or against each candidate was definite. Public Opinion
magazine found Reagan got 7,230 seconds of bad press and only 730 of good,
while Mondale enjoyed 1,330 seconds of good press and 1,050 seconds of bad.
Leading up to Reagan’s reelection run, the Institute for Applied Eco-
nomics surveyed how the network news treated economic news during the
strong recovery in the last half of 1983. It discovered that nearly 95% of the
economic statistics were positive, yet 86% of the networks’ stories were pri-
marily negative.
Emmy Award winner Bernard Goldberg spent nearly 30 years with CBS
News. His book Bias documents in detail how network television has pro-

vided one-sided news with little balance or fairness. This is a book all younger
people in America should read.
Goldberg tells how journalists decide what news they want to cover and
the slant they want to impart. More damaging, they determine what news to
minimize or keep quiet. They take sides and assign labels to people.
MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, a leading media figure, was a speechwriter for
Jimmy Carter and an aide to House Speaker Tip O’Neill. The late Tim
Russert of NBC was a political advisor to New York’s former governor, Mario
Cuomo. ABC’s Jeff Greenfield was a speechwriter for Robert Kennedy,
PBS’s Bill Moyers was Lyndon Johnson’s press secretary, and ABC news
anchor George Stephanopoulos was Clinton’s communications director.
To succeed, both as individual investors and as a nation, we need to learn
to separate facts from the personal political opinions and strong agenda-dri-
ven biases of the majority of the national media. This could be the number
one problem in our country today.
In addition to one-sided bias in the national media, freedom can be jeop-
ardized by either infiltration or propaganda designed to undermine the
nation and its people. This is intended to confuse national issues; pit one
group against another; stir up class envy, fear and hatred; and tear down or
demean certain key people or established institutions.
The most questionable practice of the one-sided media is how they select
which stories and facts to cover and continually promote. Even more impor-
tant are the critically relevant stories and facts they choose not to cover
because those stories or facts don’t support their agenda or the slant they
want the story to have.
In late 2008, public fear that the recession that was then underway might
become like the Great Depression of 1929 and the 1930s escalated, and yet
most Americans weren’t even born then and know little about that period.
Here are three outstanding books about the 1930s and early 1940s every
American should read:
Since Yesterday, The 1930s in America by Frederick Lewis Allen, gives a
good account of what happened during that period. The Life & Death of Nazi
Germany, by Robert Goldston, covers Hitler and the rise of the Nazis from
the late 1920s to the end of World War II in 1945. Masters of Deceitby former
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, covers how communism functions and oper-
ates. A well-informed and aware nation can protect and defend its freedoms.

Roaring 1920s and the Depression era of the 1930s. They are almost exact
duplicates. The Nasdaq was used because it trades more volume now than
the NYSE and represents more entrepreneurial new America companies
that have driven our markets in recent years. The Nasdaq from September
1998 to the wild peak in March 2000 actually soared 2.5 times the Dow’s
1928-29 climax run up. The Nasdaq dot-com bubble was like the tulip bulb
mania of 1636 in Holland. The Nasdaq declined 78% whereas the Dow’s
1929 crash declined 89%.
The reason history repeats in this amazing manner is that the market is
made up of millions of people acting almost 100% on human emotions. It’s
crowd psychology: human hopes, desires, fears, pride and ego behind so
many decisions. Human nature is pretty much the same today as it was in
1929. These two periods happened 70 years apart, about a lifetime. So, few
people today know what happened then. Like now, the banks had excessive
loans, then to farmers, plus stocks were bought on excessive leverage.
Unemployment at the Depression lows in 1932 peaked at 25% but was still
20% in 1939 just before WWII began.
The rally from the 1932 low to the 1936-37 peak lasted the same amount
of time as our Nasdaq recent rally back from the low of 2002 to 2007 . . . and
both fell around 50%.
History is now on the march, but it’s not like 1929, it’s like 1938.
So, what was happening in 1938?

The Nazi party in 1930 won 107 seats in the Reichstag. Hitler became
Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. He already had his storm troopers,
the Hitler youth and other Nazi organizations. Only months later, the
Reichstag gave Hitler all its constitutional powers and by July all other polit-
ical parties were outlawed. Hitler kept saying he was only interested in
peace.
By 1938, Britain and France negotiated with Hitler and tried to appease
him by making concessions. Britain believed they had a peace agreement
with Hitler, “Peace in our time.” The crowds cheered. In Parliament,
Churchill said, “We’ve suffered a defeat.” No one believed him. He was
booed. World War II began in 1939. Germany rolled over France in two
weeks.
Today, Iran is a sponsor of terrorist organizations and will have nuclear
weapons very soon plus the missile ability to deliver them. Have we learned
anything from history in the 1930s? Will we repeat Neville Chamberlain’s
mistaken belief in an agreement on a piece of paper?
I’m including two editorials by Thomas Sowell, whom I mentioned ear-
lier in Chapter 16. His work always shows unexpected facts and wisdom.
Roman Empire Outlasted U.S., But It Too Fell
December 9, 2008
THOMAS SOWELL
Will the horrors unleashed by Islamic terrorists in Mumbai cause any sec-
ond thoughts by those who are so anxious to start weakening the American
security systems currently in place, including government interceptions of
international phone calls and the holding of terrorists at Guantanamo?
Maybe. But never underestimate partisan blindness in Washington or in
the mainstream media where, if the Bush administration did it, then it must
be wrong.
Contrary to some of the more mawkish notions of what a government is
supposed to be, its top job is the protection of the people. Nobody on 9/11
would have thought that we would see nothing comparable again in this
country for seven long years.
Many people seem to have forgotten how, in the wake of 9/11, every great
national event—the World Series, Christmas, New Year’s, the Super Bowl—
was under the shadow of a fear that this was when the terrorists would strike
again.
They didn’t strike again here, even though they have struck in Spain,
Indonesia, England and India, among other places. Does anyone imagine
that this was because they didn’t want to hit America again?

Could this have had anything to do with all the security precautions that
liberals have been complaining about so bitterly, from the interception of
international phone calls to forcing information out of captured terrorists?
Too many people refuse to acknowledge that benefits have costs, even if
that cost means only having no more secrecy when making international
phone calls than you have when sending e-mails, in a world where computer
hackers abound. There are people who refuse to give up anything, even to
save their own lives.
A very shrewd observer of the deterioration of Western societies, British
writer Theodore Dalrymple, said: “This mental flabbiness is decadence, and
at the same time a manifestation of the arrogant assumption that nothing
can destroy us.”
There are growing numbers of things that can destroy us. The Roman
Empire lasted a lot longer than the United States has lasted, and yet it too
was destroyed.
Millions of lives were blighted for centuries thereafter, because the bar-
barians who destroyed Rome were incapable of replacing it with anything at
all comparable. Neither are those who threaten to destroy the United States
today.
The destruction of the United States will not require enough nuclear
bombs to annihilate cities and towns across America. After all, the nuclear
destruction of just two cities was enough to force Japan to surrender—and
the Japanese had far more willingness to fight and die than most Americans
have today.
How many Americans are willing to see New York, Chicago and Los
Angeles all disappear in nuclear mushroom clouds, rather than surrender to
whatever outrageous demands the terrorists make?
Neither Barack Obama nor those with whom he will be surrounded in
Washington show any signs of being serious about forestalling such a terri-
ble choice by taking any action with any realistic chance of preventing a
nuclear Iran.
Once suicidal fanatics have nuclear bombs, that is the point of no return.
We, our children and our grandchildren will live at the mercy of the merci-
less, who have a track record of sadism.
There are no concessions we can make that will buy off hate-filled terror-
ists. What they want—what they must have for their own self-respect, in a
world where they suffer the humiliation of being visibly centuries behind
the West in so many ways—is our being brought down in humiliation,
including self-humiliation.
Even killing us will not be enough, just as killing Jews was not enough for
the Nazis, who first had to subject them to soul-scarring humiliations and
dehumanization in their death camps.
This kind of hatred may not be familiar to most Americans but what hap-
pened on 9/11 should give us a clue—and a warning.

False Solutions and Real Problems
March 17, 2009
THOMAS SOWELL
Someone once said that Senator Hubert Humphrey, liberal icon of an ear-
lier generation, had more solutions than there were problems.
Senator Humphrey was not unique in that respect. In fact, our present
economic crisis has developed out of politicians providing solutions to prob-
lems that did not exist—and, as a result, producing a problem whose exis-
tence is all too real and all too painful.
What was the problem that didn’t exist? It was a national problem of unaf-
fordable housing. The political crusade for affordable housing got into high
gear in the 1990s and led to all kinds of changes in mortgage lending prac-
tices, which in turn led to a housing boom and bust that has left us in the
mess we are now trying to dig out of.
Usually housing affordability is measured in terms of how much of the
average person’s income it takes to cover either apartment rent or a monthly
mortgage payment.
There were certainly places here and there where it took half a family’s
income just to put a roof over their heads. Many such places were in coastal
California but there were a few others, here and there, on the east coast and
elsewhere.
But, vast areas of the country in between—“flyover country” to the east
coast and west coast elites—had housing prices that took no larger share of
the average American’s income than in the decade before the affordable
housing crusade got under way.
Why then a national crusade by Washington politicians over local prob-
lems? Probably as good an answer as any is that “It seemed like a good idea
at the time.” How are we to be kept aware of how compassionate and how
important our elected officials are unless they are busy solving some prob-
lem for us?
The problem of skyrocketing housing prices was all too real in those
places where this problem existed. When you have to live on half your
income because the other half goes for housing, that’s a real downer.
Almost invariably, these severe local problems had local causes—usually
severe local restrictions on building homes. These restrictions had a variety of

politically attractive names, ranging from “open space” laws and “smart
growth” policies to “environmental protection” and “farmland preservation.”
Like most wonderful-sounding political slogans, none of these lofty goals
was discussed in terms of that one four-letter word that people do not use in
polite political society—“cost.”
No one asked how many hundreds of thousands of dollars would be
added to the cost of an average home by “open space” laws, for example. Yet
empirical studies have shown that land-use restrictions added at least a hun-
dred thousand dollars to the average home price in dozens of places around
the country.
In some places, such as coastal California, these restrictions added sev-
eral hundred thousand dollars to the price of the average home.
In other words, where the problem was real, local politicians were the
cause. National politicians then tried to depict this as a national problem
that they would solve.
How would they solve it? By pressuring banks and other lenders to lower
their requirements for making mortgage loans, so that more people could buy
houses. The Department of Housing and Urban Development gave the gov-
ernment-sponsored enterprise Fannie Mae quotas for how many mortgages it
should buy that were made out for people with low to moderate incomes.
Like most political “solutions,” the solution to the affordable housing “prob-
lem” took little or no account of the wider repercussions this would entail.
Various economists and others warned repeatedly that lowered lending
standards meant more risky mortgages. Given the complex relationships
among banks and other financial institutions, including many big Wall Street
firms, if mortgages started defaulting, all the financial dominoes could start
falling.
These warnings were brushed aside. Politicians were too busy solving a
national problem that didn’t exist. In the process, they created very real
problems. Now they are offering even more solutions that will undoubtedly
lead to even bigger problems.

How You Could Make Your
Million Owning Mutual Funds
What Are Mutual Funds?
A mutual fund is a diversified portfolio of stocks managed by a professional
investment company, usually for a small management fee. Investors pur-
chase shares in the fund itself and make or lose money based on the com-
bined profits and losses of the stocks within the fund.
When you purchase a mutual fund, what you’re buying is long-term pro-
fessional management to make decisions for you in the stock market. You
should probably handle a mutual fund differently from the way you handle
individual stocks.
A stock may decline and never come back in price. That’s why you must
always have a loss-cutting policy. In contrast, a well-selected, diversified
domestic growth-stock fund run by an established management organiza-
tion will, in time, always recover from the steep corrections that naturally
occur during bear markets. The reason mutual funds come back is that they
are broadly diversified and generally participate in each recovery cycle in
the U.S. economy.
How to Become a Millionaire the Easy Way
Mutual funds are outstanding investment vehicles if you learn how to use
them correctly. However, many investors don’t understand how to manage
them to their advantage.

INVESTING LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
The first thing to understand is that the big money in mutual funds is
made by owning them through several business cycles (market ups and
downs). This means 10, 15, 20, or 25 years or longer. Sitting tight for that
long requires enormous patience and confidence. It’s like real estate. If
you buy a house, then get nervous and sell out after only three or four
years, you may not make anything. It takes time for your property to
appreciate.
Here’s how I believe you, as a shrewd fund investor, should plan and
invest. Pick a diversified domestic growth fund that performed in the top
quartile of all mutual funds over the last three or five years. It will probably
have an average annual rate of return of about 15% or 20%. The fund
should also have outperformed many other domestic growth-stock funds in
the latest 12 months. You’ll want to consult a reliable source for this infor-
mation. Many investment-related magazines survey fund performance
every quarter. Your stockbroker or library should have special fund perfor-
mance rating services so you can get an unbiased review of the fund you’re
interested in purchasing.
Investor’s Business Daily rates mutual funds based on their 36-month
performance records (on a scale from A+ to E) and also provides other per-
formance percentages based on different time periods. Focus your research
on mutual funds with an A+, A, or A–performance rating in IBD. During a
bear market, growth fund ratings will be somewhat lower. The fund you pick
does not have to be in the top three or four in performance each year to give
you an excellent profit over 10 to 15 years.
You should also reinvest your dividends and capital gains distributions
(profits derived from a mutual fund’s sales of stocks and bonds) to benefit
from compounding over the years.
The Magic of Compounding
The way to make a fortune in mutual funds is through compounding. Com-
pounding occurs when your earnings themselves (the performance gains
plus any dividends and reinvested capital) generate more earnings, allowing
you to put ever-greater sums to work. The more time that goes by, the more
powerful compounding becomes.
In order to get the most benefit from compounding, you’ll need a care-
fully selected growth-stock fund, andyou’ll need to stick with it over time.
For example, if you purchase $10,000 of a diversified domestic growth-stock
fund that averages about 15% a year over a period of 35 years, here is an
approximation of what the result might be, compliments of the magic of
compounding:

How You Could Make Your Million Owning Mutual Funds
First five years: $10,000 might become $20,000
Next five years: $20,000 might become $40,000
Next five years: $40,000 might become $80,000
Next five years: $80,000 might become $160,000
Next five years: $160,000 might become $320,000
Next five years: $320,000 might become $640,000
Next five years: $640,000 might become $1.28 million!
Suppose you also added $2,000 each year and let it compound as well.
Your total could then come to more than $3 million!
Now, how much more do you think you’d have if you also bought a little
extra during every bear market of 6 to 12 months while the fund was tem-
porarily down 30% or more from its peak?
Nothing’s guaranteed in this world, and, yes, there are always taxes. How-
ever, this example is representative of how the better growth funds have
performed over the last 50 years, and what could happen to you if you plan
and invest in mutual funds correctly. Over any 20- to 25-year period, your
growth fund should average two to three times what a savings account
would return. It’s definitely possible.
When Is the Best Time to Buy a Fund?
Anytime is the best time. You’ll never know what the perfect time is, and
waiting will usually result in your paying a higher price. You should focus on
getting started and becoming regular and relentless about building capital
that will compound over the years.
How Many Funds Should You Own?
As time passes, you may discover you’d like to develop an additional long-
term program. If so, do it. In 10 or 15 years, you might have hefty amounts
in two or even three funds. However, don’t overdo it. There’s no reason to
diversify broadly in mutual funds. Individuals with multimillion-dollar port-
folios could spread out somewhat further, allowing them to place sums into
a more diverse group of funds. To do this correctly, you need to make some
attempt to own funds with different management styles. For example, you
could divvy up your money among a value-type growth fund, an aggressive
growth fund, a mid- to large-cap growth fund, a small-cap fund, and so on.
Many fund organizations, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, American

Century, and others, offer families of funds with varied objectives. In most
cases, you have the right to switch to any other fund in the family at a nom-
inal transfer fee. These families can offer you the added flexibility of making
prudent changes many years later.
Are Monthly Investment Plans for You?
Programs that automatically withhold money from your paycheck are usu-
ally sound if you deposit that money in a carefully selected, diversified
domestic growth-stock fund. However, it’s best to also make a larger initial
purchase that will get you on the road to serious compounding all that much
quicker.
Don’t Let the Market Diminish Your Long-Term Resolve
Bear markets can last from six months to, in some rare cases, two or three
years. If you’re going to be a successful long-term investor in mutual funds,
you’ll need the courage and perspective to live through many discouraging
bear markets. Have the vision to build yourself a great long-term growth
program, and stick to it. Each time the economy goes into a recession, and
the newspapers and TV are saying how terrible things are, consider adding
to your fund when it’s 30% or more off its peak. You might go so far as to
borrow a little money to buy more if you feel a bear market has ended. If
you’re patient, the price should be up nicely in two or three years.
Growth funds that invest in more aggressive stocks should go up more
than the general market in bull phases, but they will also decline more in
bear markets. Don’t be alarmed. Instead, try to look ahead several years.
Daylight follows darkness.
You might think that buying mutual funds during periods like the Great
Depression would be a bad idea because it would take you 30 years to break
even. However, on an inflation-adjusted basis, had investors bought at the
exact top of 1929, they would have broken even in just 14 years, based on
the performance of the S&P 500 and the DJIA. Had these investors bought
at the top of the market in 1973, they would have broken even in just 11
years. If, in addition, they had dollar cost averaged throughout these bad
periods (meaning they had purchased additional shares as the price went
down, lowering their overall cost per share), they would have broken even
in half the time.
The 1973 drop in the Nasdaq from the peak of 137 would have been
recovered in 3½ years, and as of February 2009, the Nasdaq average had
recovered from 137 to 1,300. Even during the two worst market periods in

How You Could Make Your Million Owning Mutual Funds
history, growth funds did bounce back, and they did so in less time than
you’d expect. In other words, if you took the absolutely worst period of the
twentieth century, the Great Depression, and you bought at the top of the
market, then dollar cost averaged down, at worst, it would have taken you
seven years to break even, and over the following 21 years, you would have
seen your investment increase approximately eight times. This is compelling
evidence that dollar cost averaging into mutual funds and holding them for
the long haul could be smart investing.
Some people may find this confusing, since we have said that investors
should never dollar cost average down in stocks. The difference is that a
stock can go to zero, while a domestic, widely diversified, professionally
managed mutual fund will find its way back when the market eventually gets
better, often tracking near the performance of benchmarks like the S&P 500
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The super big gains from mutual funds come from compounding over a
span of many years. Funds should be an investment for as long as you live.
They say diamonds are forever. Well, so are your funds. So buy right and
sit tight!
Should You Buy Open- or Closed-End Funds?
“Open-end” funds continually issue new shares when people want to buy
them, and they are the most common type. Shares are normally redeemable
at net asset value whenever the present holders wish to sell.
A “closed-end” fund issues a fixed number of shares. Generally, these
shares are not redeemable at the shareholder’s option. Redemption takes
place through secondary market transactions. Most closed-end fund shares
are listed for trading on exchanges.
Better long-term opportunities are found in open-end funds. Closed-end
funds are subject to the whims and discounts below book value of the auc-
tion marketplace.
Should You Buy Load or No-Load Funds?
The fund you choose can be a “load” fund, where a sales commission is
charged, or a “no-load” fund. Many people prefer no-loads. If you buy a
fund with a sales charge, discounts are offered based on the amount you
invest. Some funds have back-end loads (sales commissions that are charged
when withdrawals are made, designed to discourage withdrawals) that you
may also want to take into consideration when evaluating a fund for pur-
chase. In any event, the commission on a fund is much less than the markup



==================================================
                     PAGE 405                     
==================================================

398
INVESTING LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
you pay to buy insurance, a new car, a suit of clothes, or your groceries. You
may also be able to sign a letter of intent to purchase a specified amount of
the fund, which may allow a lower sales charge to apply to any future pur-
chases made over the following 13 months.
Few people have been successful in trading no-load growth funds aggres-
sively on a timing basis, using moving average lines and services that spe-
cialize in fund switching. Most investors shouldn’t try to trade no-load funds
because it’s easy to make mistakes in the timing of buy and sell points.
Again, get aboard a mutual fund for the long term.
Should You Buy Income Funds?
If you need income, you will find it more advantageous not to buy an
income fund. Instead, you should select the best fund available and set up
a withdrawal plan equal to 1½% per quarter, or 6% per year. Part of the
withdrawal will come from dividend income received and part from your
capital. If you selected the fund correctly, it should generate enough
growth over the years to more than offset annual withdrawals of 6% of your
total investment.
Should You Buy Sector or Index Funds?
Steer away from funds that concentrate in only one industry or area. The
problem with these funds is that sectors go into and out of favor all the time.
Therefore, if you buy a sector fund, you will probably suffer severe losses
when that sector is out of favor or a bear market hits, unless you decide to
sell it if and when you have a worthwhile gain. Most investors don’t sell and
could end up losing money, which is why I recommend not purchasing sec-
tor funds. If you’re going to make a million in mutual funds, your fund’s
investments should be diversified for the long term. Sector funds are gener-
ally not a long-term investment.
If you are conservative, it may be OK for you to pick an index fund, where
the fund’s portfolio closely matches that of a given index, like the S&P 500.
Index funds have outperformed many actively managed funds over the long
run. I tend to prefer growth funds.
Should You Buy Bond or Balanced Funds?
I also don’t think most people should invest in bond or balanced funds.
Stock funds generally outperform bond funds, and when you combine the
two, you’re ultimately just watering down your results. However, someone

==================================================

who is in retirement might want to consider a balanced fund if less volatility
is desired.
Should You Buy Global or International Funds?
These funds might provide some diversification, but limit the percentage of
your total fund investment in this higher-risk sector to 10%. International
funds can, after a period of good performance, suffer years of laggard
results, and investing in foreign governments creates added risk. Histori-
cally, Europe and Japan have underperformed the U.S. market.
The Size Problem of Large Funds
Asset size is a problem for many funds. If a fund has billions of dollars in
assets, it will be more difficult for the fund manager to buy and sell large
positions in a stock. Thus, the fund will be less flexible in retreating from the
market or in acquiring meaningful positions in smaller, better-performing
stocks. For this reason, I’d avoid most of the largest mutual funds. If you
have one of the larger funds that’s done well over the years, and it is still
doing reasonably well despite having grown large, you should probably sit
tight. Remember, the big money is always made over the long haul. Fidelity
Contrafund, run by Will Danoff, has been the best-managed large fund for
a number of years.
Management Fees and Turnover Rates
Some investors spend a lot of time evaluating a fund’s management fees and
portfolio turnover rates, but in most cases, such nitpicking isn’t necessary.
In my experience, some of the best-performing growth funds have higher
turnover rates. (A portfolio turnover rate is the ratio of the dollar value of
buys and sells during a year to the dollar value of the fund’s total assets.)
Average turnover topped 350% in the Fidelity Magellan Fund during its
three biggest performance years. CGM Capital Development Fund, man-
aged by Ken Heebner, was the top-performing fund from 1989 to 1994. In
two of those years, 1990 and 1991, it had turnover rates of 272% and 226%,
respectively. And Heebner’s superior performance even later in CGM
Focus fund was concentrated in 20 stocks that were actively managed.
You can’t be successful and on top of the market without making any
trades. Good fund managers will sell a stock when they think it’s overvalued,
when they are worried about the overall market or a specific group, or when
they find another, more attractive stock to purchase. That’s what you hire a

professional to do. Also, the institutional commission rates that funds pay
are extremely low—only a few cents per share of stock bought or sold. So
don’t be overly concerned about turnover rates. It’s the fund’s overall per-
formance over several years that is key.
The Five Most Common Mistakes Mutual Fund Investors Make
1. Failing to sit tight for at least 10 to 15 years
2. Worrying about a fund’s management fee, its turnover rate, or the divi-
dends it pays
3. Being affected by news in the market when you’re supposed to be invest-
ing for the long term
4. Selling out during bad markets
5. Being impatient and losing confidence too soon
Other Common Mistakes
Typical investors in mutual funds tend to buy the best-performing fund
after it’s had a big year. What they don’t realize is that history virtually dic-
tates that in the next year or two, that fund will probably show much slower
results. If the economy goes into a recession, the results could be poorer
still. Such conditions are usually enough to scare off those with less convic-
tion and those who want to get rich quick.
Some investors switch (usually at the wrong time) to another fund that
someone convinces them is much safer or that has a “hotter” recent perfor-
mance record. Switching may be OK if you have a really bad fund or if
you’re in the wrong type of fund, but too much switching quickly destroys
what must be a long-term commitment to the benefits of compounding.
America’s long-term future has always been a shrewd investment. The
U.S. stock market has been growing since 1790, and the country will con-
tinue to grow in the future, in spite of wars, panics, and deep recessions.
Investing in mutual funds—the right way—is one way to benefit from
America’s growth and to secure your and your family’s long-term, 20-plus-
year financial future.
How to Use IBD to Buy ETFs
To be perfectly honest, I’m not a big fan of exchange-traded funds because
I think you can make more money by focusing on the market leaders. But
because ETFs had become so wildly popular with not only individual

investors but also asset managers, we started covering ETFs in February
2006.
ETFs are basically mutual funds that trade like a stock, but offer trans-
parency, tax efficiency, and lower expanses.
While mutual funds set their prices or net asset value (NAV) once a day,
the prices of ETFs jump and down throughout the day, just like a stock
price. Anything you can do with a stock, you can do with an ETF, such as
selling short and trading options.
ETFs are more tax-friendly than mutual funds because of what happens
under the hood. When market makers need to create or redeem shares, they
round up the underlying stocks and trade them with the provider for new
ETF shares. They do the opposite to redeem ETF shares for the underlying
stocks. No money changes hands because the shares are traded in-kind.
Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are not affected by shareholder redemptions.
If too many investors pull money out of mutual funds, fund managers may
be forced to sell the stocks they hold to raise cash, thereby incurring a tax-
able event. ETFs keep trading to a minimum, so there are few taxable gains.
ETFs charge management fees of anywhere from 0.10% to 0.95%. That’s
considerably smaller than those of mutual funds, which charge 1.02% on
average.1
However, with a good mutual fund, you’re getting a top-notch manager
who makes investment decisions for you. An ETF requires that you pull the
buy and sell triggers.
Don’t kid yourself that the diversification in an ETF will somehow pro-
tect you. Take the SPDR Financial Sector (XLF). In the banking meltdown
in 2008, this ETF plunged 57%.
The SPDR (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, was the first U.S.-listed
ETF. It started trading on the Amex in 1993. The Nasdaq 100, known today
as PowerShares QQQQ Trust (QQQQ), and the Diamonds Trust (DIA),
which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were both launched in the
late 1990s.
Today, there are ETFs tracking not only benchmark indexes, but also
bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives, carbon credits, investment
strategies such as low-P/E stocks, and more. In 2007 and 2008, ETF
launches were what IPOs were to the Internet bubble. Providers floated
ETFs based on esoteric indexes that diced sectors into ridiculous slices such
as Wal-Mart suppliers, spin-offs, companies with patents, those that don’t
do any business with Sudan, and those engaged in “sinful” activities like
gambling, alcohol, and tobacco.

ETFs have changed the way many people trade, although not always for
the better. They offer average investors access to foreign markets such as
India, which limits foreign investors. They also let you trade commodities
and currencies without having to open a separate futures or foreign
exchange trading account. And the advent of inverse ETFs lets those with
accounts that prohibit shorting to put on a short position by buying long.
Since February 2004, ETFs have accounted for from 25% to as much as
44% of the monthly trading volume on the NYSE Arca.
Top-Down Selection
IBD lists the 350 ETFs with the highest 50-day average volume and catego-
rizes them by U.S. Stock Indexes, Sector/Industry, Global, Bonds/Fixed
Income, and Commodities and Currencies. Within each category, they’re
listed by our proprietary Relative Strength rating in descending order.
Ranking ETFs by RS highlights the leaders within each category and helps
you compare them. The tables also list year-to-date return, Accumula-
tion/Distribution rating, dividend yields, the prior day’s closing price, the
price change, and the change in volume versus the daily average.
Aside from reading IBD’s ETF coverage, monitor the “Winners &
Losers” table on the exchange-traded funds page. Every day we list the
leaders and laggards over a given time period, which we rotate daily:
Monday: one-week percentage change
Tuesday: one-month percentage change
Wednesday: three-month percentage change
Thursday: six-month percentage change
Friday: twelve-month percentage change

• CHAPTER •
Improving the Management
of Pension and
Institutional Portfolios
Having managed individual accounts, pension funds, and mutual funds, as well
as having dealt with many top portfolio managers, I have a few observations
about professional money management.
Individual investors need to know as much as they can about institu-
tional money managers. After all, these managers represent the “I” in our
CAN SLIM formula and account for the majority of important price
moves. They also exert far greater influence on prices than specialists, mar-
ket makers, day traders, or advisory services do. I’ve learned from my grand
share of mistakes in the past . . . and that’s how all of us learn and become
wiser about investing. Maybe my hands-on experience with all sides of the
market through many economic cycles will offer some insights. However,
I’ve never worked a day on Wall Street. That’s probably a big plus.
Institutional Investors: An Overview
The mutual fund you own or the pension fund you participate in is quarter-
backed by an institutional money manager. You have a vested interest in
knowing whether those managers are doing a good job, but understanding
how they do their job is also of value.
Today’s markets are dominated by such pros, and most institutional buying
is done with 100% cash rather than by using borrowed money (margin). As a
result, you might have a somewhat sounder foundation for most securities
than you would if speculative margin accounts ruled our stock markets. For
example, in 1929, the public was heavily involved in the market, speculating
403

==================================================

with 10% cash and 90% margin. This is one of the reasons why so many peo-
ple got hurt when the market collapsed . . . they had too much debt.
However, margin debt as a percentage of the market capitalization of
NYSE stocks also reached an extreme level at the end of March 2000.
Banks in 1929 also carried excessive mortgage debt. This time around,
banks had lower-quality mortgage debt. However, this lower-quality debt
was strongly pushed and pursued by our government, something the politi-
cians don’t want to admit as they investigate and try to blame everyone else
rather than take responsibility for their own significant role in creating the
subprime loan financial crisis.
Professional investors usually do not panic as easily as the public can after
prolonged declines. In fact, institutional buying support often comes in
when prices are down. The severe problems the stock market encountered
from 1969 to 1975 had nothing to do with institutional or public investors.
They were the result of economic mistakes and bad policy decisions
made by politicians in Washington, D.C. The stock market is like a giant
mirror that reflects basic conditions, political management (or mismanage-
ment), and the psychology of the country.
Stiff competition among money managers and close scrutiny of their per-
formance records has probably made today’s best institutional investment
managers a little more proficient than they were 40 or 50 years ago.
The First Datagraph Books Evolve into WONDA
One of the first products we developed for institutional investors was the
O’Neil Database Datagraph books, which contain extremely detailed charts
on thousands of publicly traded companies. They were the first of their kind
and represented an innovation in the institutional investment world.
We were able to produce these books at timely weekly intervals, updating
them at the market close every Friday. These comprehensive books were
delivered to institutional money managers over the weekend in time for
Monday’s market open. This quick turnaround (for its time) was achieved
not only because of the equity database we compiled and maintained on a
daily basis, but also because of our high-speed microfilm plotting equip-
ment. When we started out in 1964, this costly computer machinery was so
new no one knew how to get a graph out of it. Once this barrier was cleared,
it was possible to turn out complex, updated graphs through an automated
process, at the rate of one per second.
Today, the technology has advanced so far that we can generate the most
complex stock datagraphs with hardly a second thought, and the O’Neil
Database books have become a mainstay at many of the leading mutual fund

organizations around the globe. Initially, each Datagraph displayed price and
volume information, along with a few technical and fundamental data items.
Today, each Datagraph displays 96 fundamental and 26 technical items, and
these are available for more than 8,000 stocks in 197 proprietary industry
groups. This means an analyst or portfolio manager can quickly compare any
company to any other, either in the same industry or in the entire database.
We still offer the O’Neil Database books, with their 600 pages of Data-
graphs, to our institutional clients as part of our overall institutional invest-
ment business. With the advent of the Internet and highly sophisticated
computer technology, however, these old-technology, hard-copy books are
being replaced by our newest and most innovative flagship service,
WONDA. WONDA stands for William O’Neil Direct Access, and it pro-
vides all our institutional clients with a direct interface to the O’Neil Data-
base. The O’Neil Database now contains more than 3,000 technical and
fundamental data items on more than 8,000 U.S. stocks, and WONDA
allows users to screen and monitor the database using any combination of
these data items.
We originally developed WONDA as an in-house system that we could use
to manage our own money. In the 1990s, after years of real-time use, refine-
ment, and upgrading, the service was rolled out as the newest William O’Neil
+ Co. service, available to the professional and institutional community.
Because WONDA was conceived and created by our in-house portfolio
managers and computer programmers, the service was designed with the
serious institutional money manager in mind. Institutional money managers
must frequently make rapid decisions while under fire during the market
day, and WONDA offers a wide range of features that allows instantaneous
access to and monitoring of crucial stock data and related information as the
market is moving.
Some of our institutional clients who use WONDA say they can “practi-
cally print money” with the system. These clients run the gamut from very
conservative value-type managers to hedge fund managers. Clearly, no com-
puter system can print money, but that type of comment from some of our
biggest and best institutional clients points out the functionality and effec-
tiveness of WONDA.
Interpreting Dome Petroleum’s Datagraph
One of the secrets that you, as a winning individual investor, should never
forget is that you want to buy a stock before its potential is obvious to others.
When numerous research reports show up, it might actually be time to con-
sider selling. If it’s value is obvious to almost everyone, it’s probably too late.

The accompanying Datagraph of Dome Petroleum has been marked up to
highlight a few of the ways we interpret and use this display of fundamanetal
and technical information. We suggested Dome to institutions in November,
1977 at $48. Fund managers didn’t like the idea, so we bought the stock our-
selves. Dome became one of our biggest winners at that time. This and the
following case studies are real-life examples of how it’s actually done.
The Pic ’N’ Save Story
In July 1977, we suggested a stock that no institution would touch: Pic ’N’
Save. Most institutional managers felt the company was entirely too small
because it traded only 500 shares a day, so we began purchasing it several
months later. We had the successful historical computer models of Kmart in
1962, when it traded only 1,000 shares a day, and of Jack Eckerd Drug in
April 1967, when it traded 500 shares a day, so we knew that, based on its
excellent fundamentals and historical precedent, Pic ’N’ Save could become
a real winner.
Precedent was on our side. Both Kmart and Eckerd had become big win-
ners in those early days after they were discovered, and average daily trad-
ing volume increased steadily as a result. The same thing occurred with Pic
’N’ Save. This little, unknown company, headquartered in Carson, Califor-
nia, turned in a steady and remarkable performance for seven or eight years.
In fact, Pic ’N’ Save’s pretax margins, return on equity, annual earnings
growth rate, and debt-to-equity ratio were at that time superior to those of
the other, more widely accepted institutional growth favorites—such as
Wal-Mart Stores—that we had also recommended.
I’ve always believed in finding an outstanding stock and buying it at every
point on the way up. That’s almost what happened with Pic ’N’ Save. We
bought it almost every point or two on the way up for several years. I liked
the company because it provided a way for families of meager means to buy
most of the necessities of life at exceptionally low prices. All told, we bought
Pic ’N’ Save on 285 different days and held it for 7½ years. When we finally
sold it, while it was still advancing, our sale did not affect the market. Our
early purchases showed more than a 10-fold gain.
Radio Shack’s Charles Tandy
We first uncovered Tandy Corp. in 1967, but we were able to convince only
two institutions to buy the stock. Among the reasons given for not buying it
were that it didn’t pay a dividend and that Charles Tandy was just a promoter.
(Qualcomm was another stock that was considered to be too promotional

from 1996 to 1998. We picked it up straight off the weekly chart at the very
end of 1998. It became the leading winner of 1999, advancing 20-fold.)
When I met Tandy in his office in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, my reac-
tion was very positive. He was a brilliant financial man who also happened to
be an outstanding salesman. He had innovative incentives, departmental
financial statements, and highly detailed daily computer reports on sales of
every item in every store by merchandise type, price, and category. His auto-
mated inventory and financial controls were almost unbelievable for that time.
After the stock tripled, Wall Street analysts started to acknowledge its
existence. There were even a few research reports noting Tandy as an
undervalued situation. Isn’t it strange how far some stocks have to go up
before they begin to look cheap to everyone?
The Size Problem in Portfolio Management
Many institutions think their main problem is size. Because they manage
billions of dollars in assets, there never seem to be enough big-capitalization
stocks they can buy or sell easily.
Let’s face it: size is definitely an obstacle. It’s easier to manage $10 million
than $100 million; it’s easier to manage $100 million than $1 billion; and $1
billion is a piece of cake compared to running $10 billion, $20 billion, or $30
billion. The size handicap simply means it’s harder to buy or get rid of a
huge stock holding in a small- or medium-sized company.
However, I believe it’s a mistake for institutions to restrict their invest-
ments solely to large-cap companies. In the first place, there definitely
aren’t always enough outstanding ones to invest in at any given time. Why
buy a slow-performing stock just because you can easily acquire a lot of it?
Why buy a big-cap stock with earnings that are growing only 10% to 12% a
year? If institutions limit themselves to large-cap investments, they could
miss out on the truly powerful growth in the stock market.
From 1981 to 1987, during the Reagan years, more than 3,000 dynamic,
up-and-coming companies incorporated or had initial public offerings of
stock. This was a first, and it was due mainly to several reductions in the cap-
ital gains tax during the early 1980s. Many of these small- to medium-sized
entrepreneurial concerns became enormous future market leaders and
were responsible for driving the unprecedented technology boom and big
expansion of new jobs in the 1980s and 1990s. Most of these names were
small, unknown companies at the time, but you’ll recognize them now as
some of the biggest names and greatest winning companies of that period.
This is just a partial list of the thousands of ingenious innovators that
reignited growth in America until the March 2000 market top.

As mentioned earlier, our government should seriously consider lowering
the capital gains tax again and possibly shortening the time period to six
months to help fuel a new cycle of entrepreneurial start-up companies.
Today’s markets are more liquid than markets of the past, with the vol-
ume of many medium-sized stocks averaging 500,000 to 5,000,000 shares a
day. In addition, there is significant crossing of blocks between institutions,
which also aids liquidity. The institutional manager who handles billions of
dollars would be best advised to broaden his prospects to the 4,000 or more
innovative companies that are available. This is better than restricting his
activities to the same few hundred large, well-known, or legal-list-type com-
panies. At one point, the research department of one of the nation’s largest
banks followed only 600 companies.
A sizable institution would probably be better off owning 500 companies
of all sizes than 100 large, mature, slow-moving companies. However,
mutual funds that concentrate in small-cap big performers have to be more
careful. If they have only a few hundred million to manage, this strategy
might be quite rewarding.
However, if these same funds, through their own success, grow to several
billion dollars, they can’t continue to concentrate solely in fast-moving, more
speculative smaller names. The reason is that these stocks perform well in one
phase and then later top; some of them never come back or lag in perfor-
mance for years. Several Janus and Putnam funds ran into this problem dur-
ing the late 1990s and early 2000s period. Success can breed overconfidence.
Pension funds can address size problems of their own by spreading their
money among several different managers with different investment styles.
Size Is Not the Key Problem
However, size isn’t the number one problem for institutional investors. Fre-
quently, it’s their investment philosophies and methods that keep them from
fully capitalizing on the potential of the market.
Many institutions buy stocks based on their analysts’ opinions about the
supposed value of a company. Others mainly buy stories. Still others follow

economists’ top-down predictions of the broad sectors that ought to do well.
We believe working from the bottom up (concentrating on locating stocks
with winning characteristics) produces better results.
In the past, some institutions used the same standard names for many
years and rarely changed their approved lists. If a list had a hundred widely
accepted names, four or five might be added each year. Many decisions had
to be approved by investment committees. However, market decisions
made by committees are typically poor. To make matters worse, some com-
mittees had members who weren’t experienced money managers. This is
questionable investment policy.
Even today, some institutions’ investment flexibility is hamstrung by anti-
quated rules. Some more conservative institutions, for example, can’t buy
stocks that don’t pay dividends. This seems right out of the Dark Ages, since
many outstanding growth stocks deliberately don’t pay dividends; instead,
they reinvest their profits in the company to continue funding their above-
average growth. Other restrictions mandate that half or more of the portfo-
lio be invested in bonds. Most bond portfolios have produced weak results
over the long term. Also, in the past, some bond portfolios have used mis-
leading accounting that did not value the portfolio at current market prices.
In these situations, portfolio results are reported too infrequently and the
true overall performance is unclear. There is too much emphasis on yield
and not enough on the increase or decrease in the market value of the assets
in the portfolio.
The main problem is that most of these antiquated, institutionally
accepted investment decision processes have a deeply rooted legal basis.
They have become, in a word, “institutionalized.” Many institutions are
forced to adhere to legal concepts such as “due diligence” and “fiduciary
responsibility” when they make investment decisions. In most cases, a trust
department can be held liable for poor or derelict investment decisions, but
the standard for determining whether an investment decision is poor or
derelict has nothing to do with the performance of the investment itself!
If an institution can show that the selection of a stock it decided to invest
in was based on the old “prudent man” rule (meaning the institution acted
as a prudent man or woman would be expected to act when dealing with his
or her own money), that it took into account valuation based on a static view
of a company’s fundamental situation, or that it was part of an overall “asset
allocation” model or some other similar reason arrived at by due diligence,
then the institution can show it exercised its fiduciary responsibility prop-
erly and thus sidestep any liability.
Years ago, institutions had relatively few fund managers to choose from,
but today there are many outstanding professional money-management

teams using a variety of systems. However, many managers can’t buy a
stock that’s not on a preapproved list unless it’s accompanied by a long,
glowing report from one of the institution’s analysts. Since the institutions
already own a substantial number of companies that they insist their ana-
lysts continue to follow and update, it might take an analyst more time to
get interesting new names onto an approved list and reports prepared on
these companies.
Superior performance comes from fresh ideas, not from the same old
overused, stale names or last cycle’s favorites. For example, the super tech
leaders of 1998 and 1999 will probably be replaced by many new consumer-
and defense-sector leaders in the twenty-first century.
Bottom Buyers’ Bliss
Many institutions buy stocks on the way down, but bottom fishing isn’t
always the best way to achieve superior performance. It can place decision
makers in the position of buying stocks that are slowly deteriorating or
whose growth is decelerating.
Other money management organizations use valuation models that restrict
investments to stocks in the lower end of their historical P/E ranges. This
approach works for a number of unusually capable, conservative profession-
als, but over time, it rarely produces truly superior results. Several major Mid-
west banks that use this approach have continually lagged in performance.
Entirely too many analysts have a P/E hang-up. They want to sell a stock
with a P/E that’s up and looks high and buy one when it’s P/E comes off.
Fifty years of models of the most successful stocks show that low or “rea-
sonable” P/Es are not a cause of huge increases in price. Those who were
faithful to low P/Es probably missed almost every major stock market win-
ner of the last half century.
Most of those who concentrate on the undervalued theory of stock selec-
tion may lag today’s better managers. Sometimes these undervalued situa-
tions get more undervalued or lag the market for a long time. In the market
free-fall in late 2008 and early 2009, I noticed several value funds that were
down about as much as some of the growth funds, which is unusual.
Comparing Growth versus Value Results
Over the previous 12 business cycles, it’s been my experience that the very
best money managers during a cycle produced average annual compounded
total returns of 25% to, in a few rare cases, 30%. This small group consisted
of either growth-stock managers or managers whose most successful invest-



==================================================

ments were in growth stocks plus a few big turnaround situations.
The best undervalued-type managers in the same period averaged only
15% to 20%. A few had gains of over 20%, but they were in the minority.
Most individual investors haven’t prepared themselves well enough to aver-
age 25% or more per year, regardless of the method used.
Value funds will do better in down or poor market periods. Their stocks
typically haven’t gone up a large amount during the prior bull market peri-
ods, and so they typically will correct less. Therefore, most people who are
trying to prove the value case will pick a market top as the beginning point
of a 10-or-more-year period during which to compare value with growth
investing. This leads to an unfair comparison in which value investing may
“prove” more successful than growth-stock investing. The reality is that if
you look at the situation fairly, growth-stock investing usually outperforms
value investing over most periods.
Value Line Dumps the Undervalued System
From the 1930s up to the early 1960s, the Value Line service rated the
stocks it followed as undervalued or overvalued. The company’s results were
mediocre until it dumped the system in the 1960s and began rating stocks
based on earnings increases and relative market action. After the switch,
Value Line’s performance improved.
Overweighting and Underweighting Relative to the S&P
Many institutions invest primarily in stocks that are in the S&P 500 and try
to overweight or underweight their positions in certain sectors. This prac-
tice ensures they’ll never do much better or much worse than the S&P 500.
However, an outstanding small-cap or mid-cap growth-stock manager
should potentially be able to average about 1¼ to 1½ times the S&P 500
over a period of several years. The S&P 500 is a tough index for a mutual
fund to materially beat because the S&P is really a managed portfolio that
continues to add newer, better companies and discard laggards. Another
way to outperform the S&P is to buy superior new growth stocks or stocks
that are not in the S&P.
Weaknesses of the Industry Analyst System
Another widely used but expensive and ineffective practice is to hire a
large number of analysts and then divvy up coverage by industry. Some of
this is done for the investment banking side in order to develop and main-

tain client relationships. Thus, at a minimum, analysts have in the past had
split loyalties.
The typical securities research department has an auto analyst, an elec-
tronics analyst, an oil analyst, a retail analyst, a drug analyst, and on and on.
But this setup is not efficient and tends to perpetuate mediocre perfor-
mance. What does an analyst who is assigned two or three out-of-favor
groups do? Recommend the least bad of all the poor stocks she follows?
On the other hand, the analyst who happens to follow the year’s best-per-
forming group may recommend only two or three winners, missing many
others. When the oil stocks boomed in 1979 and 1980, all of them doubled
or tripled. The best shot up five times or more.
The theory behind dividing up research is that this allows a person to be
an expert on a particular industry. In fact, Wall Street firms will go so far as
to hire a chemist from a chemical company to be their chemical analyst and
a Detroit auto specialist to be their automotive analyst. These individuals
may know the nuts and bolts of their industries, but in many cases, they have
little understanding of the general market and what makes leading stocks go
up and down. Maybe this explains why virtually every analyst appearing on
CNBC after September 2000 continued to recommend buying high-tech
stocks as they were on their way to 80% to 90% declines. People lost a lot of
money if they followed this free advice on TV. A similar repeat performance
occurred in 2008, when fundamental analysts recommended buying oils
and banks on their way down because they looked very cheap. They then got
a lot cheaper.
Firms also like to advertise they have more analysts, the largest depart-
ment, or more top-ranked “all-star” analysts. I’d rather have five good ana-
lysts who are generalists than 50, 60, or 70 who are confined to limited
specialties. What are your chances of finding 50 or more analysts who are all
outstanding at making money in the market or coming up with moneymak-
ing ideas?
The shortcomings of Wall Street analysts were never made plainer to
institutional and individual investors than during the 2000 bear market.
While the market continued to sell off in what would at the time become the
worst bear market since 1929 as measured by the percentage decline in the
Nasdaq index, and while many former high-flying tech and Internet stocks
were being decimated, Wall Street analysts continued to issue “buy” or
“strong buy” recommendations on these stocks.
In October 2000, one major Wall Street firm was running full-page ads
calling the market environment at that time “One of the Ten Best Times to
Own Stocks” in history. As we now know, the market continued to plummet
well into 2001 and 2002, making that period one of the worsttimes in his-

tory to own stocks! It was not until many of the tech and Internet high-fly-
ers were down 90% or more from their peaks that these analysts finally
changed their tune—many days late and many dollars short!
A December 31, 2000, New York Timesarticle on analysts’ recommenda-
tions quoted Zacks Investment Research as follows: “Of the 8,000 recom-
mendations made by analysts covering the companies in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Stock Index, only 29 now are sells.” In the same article, Arthur
Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, stated: “The
competition for investing banking business is so keen that analysts’ sell rec-
ommendations on stocks of banking clients are very rare.” A mutual fund
manager quoted by the Timessaid: “What passes for research on Wall Street
today is shocking to me. Instead of providing investors with the kind of
analysis that would have kept them from marching over the cliff, analysts
prodded them forward by inventing new valuation criteria for stocks that
had no basis in reality and no standards of good practice.” Vanity Fairalso
ran an interesting article on the analytical community in August 2001.
Clearly, at no time in the history of the markets has the phrase caveat emp-
tor had more meaning for investors, both institutional and individual alike.
The implementation of SEC Rule FD, governing the fair disclosure of
material company information to both institutional and individual investors,
in 2000 has restricted the ability of major brokerage research analysts to
receive inside information from a company before it is released to the rest
of the Street. This has further reduced any advantage that can be gained by
listening to most Wall Street analysts. We prefer to deal only with facts and
historical models rather than opinions about supposed values. Many
research analysts in 2000 and 2001 had not been in the business for 10 years
or longer and therefore had never experienced the terrible bear markets of
1987, 1974–1975, and 1962.
On still another subject, many large money-management groups proba-
bly deal with entirely too many research firms. For one thing, there aren’t
that many strong research inputs, and dealing with 20 or 30 firms dilutes the
value and impact of the few good ones. Confusion, doubt, and fear created
by conflicting advice at critical junctures can prove to be expensive. It would
be interesting to know how many analysts have been highly successful in
their own investments. This is the ultimate test.
Financial World’s Startling Survey of Top Analysts
A Financial World magazine article dated November 1, 1980, also found
that the analysts selected by Institutional Investormagazine as the best on
Wall Street were overrated and overpaid, and that they materially under-



==================================================

performed the S&P averages. As a group, the “superstar” analysts failed on
two out of three stock picks to match either the market as a whole or their
own industry averages. They also seldom provided sell recommendations,
limiting most of their advice to buys or holds. The Financial World study
confirmed research we performed in the early 1970s. We found that only a
minority of Wall Street recommendations were successful. We also con-
cluded that during a period in which many sell opinions were in order, just
1 in 10 reports made a sell suggestion.
One problem is that a lot of the research on Wall Street is done on the
wrong companies. Every industry analyst has to turn out a certain amount of
product, but only a few industry groups lead a typical market cycle. There’s
insufficient front-end screening or control to determine the superior com-
panies on which research reports should actually be written.
Database Power and Efficiency
On any given day, most institutional money managers receive a stack of
research reports a foot high. Trudging through them in search of a good
stock is usually a waste of time. If they’re lucky, they may spot 1 in 20 that’s
really right to buy.
In contrast, those with access to WONDA can rapidly screen all the com-
panies in our database. If the defense industry pops up as one of the leading
industries, they can call up 84 different corporations whose primary busi-
ness is in that area. The typical institution might look at Boeing, Raytheon,
United Technologies, and two or three other big, well-known names. Since
WONDA provides more than 3,000 technical and fundamental variables on
each of the 84 companies stretching back a number of years, as well as the
ability to display these variables quickly on identical graphic displays, it’s
possible for an institutional money manager to identify in 20 minutes the 5
or 10 companies in the entire group that have outstanding characteristics
and are worthy of more detailed research. It’s a vital time-saver some of
America’s very best money managers relentlessly use.
In other words, there are ways for an institution’s analysts to spend their
time far more productively. Yet few research departments are organized to
take advantage of such advanced and disciplined procedures.
How well has this approach worked? In 1977, we introduced an institu-
tional service called New Stock Market Ideas and Past Leaders to Avoid
(NSMI). Now titled New Leaders and Laggards Review, it is published every
week, and its documented, 30-year long-term performance record is shown
on the accompanying graph. These performance returns were audited and
verified by one of the top independent accounting firms in America.

Performance computations reflect a weekly compounded rate of return. Dividends and commissions were not considered in any computations. All holdings are rebalanced to equal dollar amounts at the beginning of the week.
Percent gains and losses are calculated for all issues that remain on the “LEADER IDEAS” or “LAGGARD IDEAS” at the end of the week.
Performance results do not represent actual trading, and they may not reflect the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on the investment decision-making process if actually managing client money.
The above does not imply comparable future performance. It should be recognized there is substantial speculative risk in most common stocks.

Improving the Management of Pension and Institutional Portfolios
Over the last 30 years, positive selections have outperformed avoidsmore
than 307 to 1, and the positive picks over 30 years outran the S&P 500 stocks
more than 41-fold. The compounding over the 30 years’ time helps make a
superior long-term record like this possible. For the 30 years ended 2008,
stocks listed as stocks to avoid made a teeny 19% gain for the entire 30 years.
Institutions could have dramatically improved their performance just by
staying out of all the stocks on our avoid list. As a service to our institutional
clients, we provide them with computerized quarterly performance reports
for every buy and avoid suggestion made in the New Stock Market Ideas
service. How many competing firms provide the actual percent perfor-
mance of all their ideas over an extended period.
By having a massive amount of factual data on every firm and proven his-
torical precedent chart models over more than 100 years, we’re able to dis-
cover a stock that’s beginning to improve or get in trouble much
earlier—without ever visiting or talking to the company. It may be naïve to
believe companies are always going to tell you when they are beginning to
have problems. By using our own factual data and historical research, we
also discourage any reliance on tips, rumors, and analysts’ personal opinions.
We just don’t need such information. We also do not have investment bank-
ing clients or market-making activities. Nor do we manage money for other
people or hire any research analysts to prepare written research reports. So
those areas of potential bias or underperformance are nonexistent.
The 1982 and 1978 Full-Page Bullish Ads
We usually don’t try to call every short-term or intermediate correction. For
institutional investors, this would be a little foolish and shortsighted. Our
primary focus is on recognizing and acting upon the early stages of each new
bull and bear market. This work includes searching for the market sectors
and groups that should be bought and those that should be avoided.
In early 1982, we placed a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journalstating
that the back of inflation had been broken and the important stocks had
already made their lows. That May, we mailed out two wall charts to our
institutional clients: one of defense electronics stocks, and the other of 20
consumer growth stocks we thought might be attractive for the bull market
ahead. We also made a point of going to New York and Chicago to meet with
several large institutions. In these meetings, we stated our bullish posture
and provided a list of names that could be purchased after these organiza-
tions did their due diligence.
The stance we took was diametrically opposed to the position of most
institutional research firms at that time, as well as to the negative news

flooding out of the national media each day. Most investment firms were
downright bearish. They anticipated another big down leg in the market.
They also projected that interest rates and inflation were going to soar back
to new highs as a result of massive government borrowing that would crowd
the private sector out of the marketplace.
The fear and confusion created by these questionable judgments frightened
large investors so much that they hesitated. As a result, they did not fully capi-
talize on the fact that we had already identified the two leading groups for the
coming bull market. It appeared professional managers had been bombarded
with so much negative “expert” Wall Street input that they found our positive
findings hard to believe. As for us, we invested fully on margin in the summer
of 1982 and enjoyed our best performance ever up to that time. From 1978 to
1991, our account increased 20-fold. From the beginning of 1998 through
2000, our firm’s account, run out of our separate holding company, increased
1,500%. Results such as this remind us it may be an advantage notto be head-
quartered in rumor-filled and emotion-packed Wall Street. I have never
worked one day on Wall Street in my entire time in the investment field.
As a savvy individual investor, you have a gigantic advantage in not having
to listen to 50 different, strongly held opinions. You can see from this exam-
ple that majority opinions seldom work in the market and that stocks seem to
require doubt and disbelief—the proverbial “wall of worry”—to make mean-
ingful progress. The market generally moves to disappoint the majority.
Our first full-page ad in the Wall Street Journalwas placed in March 1978.
It predicted a new bull market in small- to medium-sized growth stocks. We
had written the ad weeks ahead of time and waited to run it until we felt the
time was right. The right time came when the market was making new lows,
which caught investors by surprise. Our only reason for placing the ad was to
document in print exactly what our position was at that juncture, so that insti-
tutional investors could have no question about it later on.
It is at these extremely difficult market turning points that an institutional
firm can be of most value. At such times, many people are either petrified
with fear or carried away with excessive fundamental information.
Our institutional historical precedent firm has more than 500 leading
institutional accounts in the United States and around the world. We were
one of the few firms to tell its accounts they should avoid or sell tech stocks
and raise cash in March, April, and September 2000.
Institutional Investors Are Human
If you don’t think fear and emotion can ride high among professional
investors after a prolonged decline, think again. I remember meeting with

the top three or four money managers of one important bank at the bottom
of the market in 1974. They were as shell-shocked, demoralized, and con-
fused as anyone could possibly be. (They deserved to be: the ordinary stock
in the market at that time was down 75%.) About the same time, I recall vis-
iting with another top manager. He too was thoroughly worn out and, judg-
ing from the peculiar color of his face, suffering from market sickness. Yet
another top fund manager in Boston looked as if he’d been run over by a
train. (Of course, all of this is preferable to 1929, when some people jumped
out of office buildings in response to the devastating market collapse.)
I also recall a high-tech seminar given in 1983 in San Francisco, attended
by 2,000 highly educated analysts and portfolio managers. Everyone was
there, and everyone was ebullient and self-confident, and that marked the
exact top for high-tech stocks.
I also remember a presentation we gave to a bank in another large city. All
its analysts were brought in and sat around an impressive table in the board-
room, but not one analyst or portfolio manager asked any questions during
or after the presentation. It was the strangest situation I’ve ever been in.
Needless to say, this institution consistently performed in the lower quar-
tiles compared to its more alert and venturesome competitors. It’s impor-
tant to communicate and be open to new ideas.
Years ago, one medium-sized bank for which we did consulting work
insisted we give them recommendations only from among the stocks it car-
ried on its limited approved list. After consulting with the bank’s managers
each month for three months and telling them that there was nothing on
their approved list that met our qualifications, we had to honorably part com-
pany. A few months later, we learned that key officials in that trust depart-
ment had been relieved of their jobs as a result of their laggard performance.
We provided product to another Midwest institution, but it was of doubt-
ful value because the institution had a cast-in-concrete belief that any
potential investment had to be screened to see if it passed an undervalued
model. The best investments rarely show up on any undervalued model, and
there’s probably no way this institution will ever produce first-rate results
until it throws out the model. This isn’t easy for large organizations to do. It’s
like asking a Baptist to become a Catholic or vice versa.
Some large money-management organizations with average records tend
to fire the head of the investment department and then look for a replace-
ment who invests pretty much the same way. Naturally, this doesn’t solve the
problem of deficient investment methods and philosophy. Security Pacific
Bank in Los Angeles was an exception to this rule. In July 1981, it made a
change in its top investment management. It brought in an individual with
a completely different approach, a superior investment philosophy, and an

outstanding performance record. The results were dramatic and were
accomplished almost overnight. In 1982, Security Pacific’s Fund G was
ranked number one in the country.
Penny-Wise and Performance-Foolish
Some corporations put too much emphasis on saving management fees, par-
ticularly when they have giant funds to be managed. It’s usually an actuary
who convinces them of the money their pension fund can save by shaving
the fee by 1⁄ of 1%.
8
If corporations have billions of dollars to be managed, it makes sense for
them to increase their fees and incentives so they can hire the best money
managers in the business. The better managers will earn the extra 0.25% or
0.50% ten or twenty times over. The last thing you ever want is cheap advice
in the stock market. If you were going to have open-heart surgery, would
you look for the doctor who’ll charge the absolute least?
How to Select and Measure Money Managers Properly
Here are a few tips for corporations and organizations that want to farm out
their funds to several money managers.
In general, portfolio managers should be given a complete cycle before
their performance is reviewed for the purpose of deciding whether to
change managers. Give them from the peak of one bull market period to
the peak of another cycle or from the trough of one cycle to the trough of
another. This will usually cover a three- or four-year period and will allow
all managers to go through both an up market and a down market. At the
end of this period, the bottom 20% or so of the managers in total overall
performance should be replaced. Thereafter, every year or two, the bottom
5% or 10% of managers over the most recent three- or four-year period
should be dropped. This avoids hasty decisions based on disappointing per-
formance over a few short quarters or a year. Given time, this process will
lead to an outstanding group of proven money managers. Because this is a
sound, longer-term, self-correcting mechanism, it should stay that way.
Then it won’t be necessary to pay as many consultants to recommend
changes in personnel.
In the selection of managers, consideration should be given to their latest
three- to five-year performance statistics as well as to a more recent period.
Diversification among the types, styles, and locations of managers should be
considered. The search should be widespread and not necessarily limited to
one consultant’s narrow, captive universe or stable of managers.

INVESTING LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
The corporate or pension fund client with money to be managed also has
to be careful not to interfere at critical junctures—deciding, for example,
when a greater proportion of the portfolios should be either in stocks or in
bonds or that undervalued stocks should be emphasized.
Cities and counties that have funds to invest must be very careful, because
few of their personnel are highly experienced in the investment field. These
inexperienced people can easily be talked into investing in bonds that are pro-
moted as being safe but that later can cause enormous losses. This happened,
of course, in 2008 with AAA subprime loans in real estate mortgage packages.
Clients can also interfere by directing where commissions should go or
insisting that executions be given to whoever does them most cheaply. The
latter, while a well-meaning attempt to save money, commonly results in
forcing upon a money manager someone who provides either poorer execu-
tions or no research input of real value. This handicap costs the portfolio
money, as it pays ½ point or more (or its decimal equivalents) on trades that
are executed by less experienced people.
Is an Index Fund the Way to Go?
Finally, a word about the indexing of equity portfolios. There’s an assump-
tion that a pension fund’s objective is to match the performance of some
general market index. This theoretically could be a risky conclusion.
If we were to go through another 1929 market collapse, and the general
market indexes were to decline 90% in value, no intelligent trustee could
possibly believe his fund’s objective should be to lose 90% of its value. No
one will be happy just because the fund achieved its target of matching the
index’s disastrous performance.
I saw a small version of this happen in 1974 when I was called in to eval-
uate a fund that had lost exactly 50% of its assets because it was managed by
an organization that specialized in and promoted index funds. People were
very upset, but they were too embarrassed to state their conclusion publicly.
Why should anyone expect the majority of money managers to be any
better at their jobs than the majority of musicians, ballplayers, doctors,
teachers, artists, or carpenters are at theirs? The fact of the matter is that the
typical person in a given field may be slightly subpar. The answer in money
management is the same as in other occupations: to get above-average
results, you have to go out of your way to find the minority of managers who
can beat the market indexes fairly consistently.
Some people will say this is impossible, but that’s simply not true. To say
that all information is already known, that stocks can’t be selected in a way
that outperforms market averages, is nonsense.

Improving the Management of Pension and Institutional Portfolios
Value Line’s rating system since 1965 is ample evidence that stocks can be
selected in a way that materially outperforms the market. Our own top
Datagraph-rated stocks have dramatically outperformed the market.
During a sabbatical at the University of Chicago, Professor Marc Rein-
ganum of the University of Iowa, and later of Southern Methodist Univer-
sity, conducted an independent research study titled “Selecting Superior
Securities.” For his research, he picked nine variables comparable to those
discussed in this book and achieved a 1984–1985 result that was 36.7%
greater than the S&P 500. He’s not alone. We’ve now received more than
1,000 testimonials from investors who also have materially outperformed
the market indexes.
Those who say the stock market is a random walk are sadly misinformed.
There are a number of systems and services that can and do outperform the
market. Unfortunately, there are also too many poorly based opinions, too
many faulty interpretations, and too many destructive emotions that come
into play. Sometimes judgments are just bad or shallow. Sometimes there are
too many complex variables. Sometimes events change too fast to keep up
with, and finally, there are just too many fundamental and technical research
reports recommending mediocre stocks on their way down. That’s why sell
recommendations are few and far between when each bear market begins.
In the future, the indexing of a small part of social security investments
may eventually be possible if rules can be created to keep the government
away from influencing any of the investment decisions. After all, the rather
poor existing social security investments do not even keep up with inflation
over any long-term period of 20 years.
You can see that even the pros need to evaluate what they’re doing and
alter their preconceived methods if they aren’t working. We all make mis-
takes, but the answer is to learn what’s working once you see what’s not. His-
tory will give you solid examples that should guide you in your investing.
Only by careful study and research—and by not accepting conventional wis-
dom—have we uncovered these valuable findings. Use them and profit. You
can make it happen. Study the 100 examples in Chapter 1 carefully so you
will better know what to look for in the future.

• CHAPTER •
Important Rules and
Guidelines to Remember
1. Don’t buy cheap stocks. Buy mainly Nasdaq stocks selling at between
$15 and $300 a share and NYSE stocks selling from $20 to $300 a share.
The majority of super stocks emerge from bases of $30 and up. Avoid
the junk pile below $10.
2. Buy growth stocks where each of the last three years’ annual earnings
per share have been up at least 25% and the next year’s consensus earn-
ings estimate is up 25% or more. Many growth stocks will also have
annual cash flow of 20% or more above EPS.
3. Make sure the last two or three quarters’ earnings per share are up a
huge amount. Look for a minimum of 25% to 30%. In bull markets,
look for EPS up 40% to 500%. (The higher, the better.)
4. See that each of the last three quarters’ sales are accelerating in their
percentage increases or the last quarter’s sales are up at least 25%.
5. Buy stocks with a return on equity of 17% or more. The great compa-
nies will show a return on equity of 25% to 50%.
6. Make sure the recent quarterly after-tax profit margins are improving
and are near the stock’s peak after-tax margins.
7. Most stocks should be in the top six or so broad industry sectors in
IBD’s daily “New Price Highs” list or in the top 10% of IBD’s “197
Industry Sub-Group Rankings.”
8. Don’t buy a stock because of its dividend or its P/E ratio. Buy it because
it’s the number one company in its particular field in terms of earnings
and sales growth, ROE, profit margins, and product superiority.

Important Rules and Guidelines to Remember
9. Buy stocks with a Relative Price Strength rating of 85 or higher in
Investor’s Business Daily’s SmartSelectratings.
10. Any size capitalization will do, but the majority of your stocks should trade
an average daily volume of several hundred thousand shares or more.
11. Learn to read charts and recognize proper bases and exact buy points.
Use daily and weekly charts to materially improve your stock selection
and timing. Long-term monthly charts can help, too. Buy stocks when
they initially break out of sound and proper bases with volume for the
day 50% or more above normal trading volume.
12. Carefully average up, not down, and cut every single loss when it is 7%
or 8% below your purchase price, with absolutely no exceptions.
13. Write out your sell rules that determine when you will sell and nail
down a worthwhile profit in your stock.
14. Make sure that at least one or two better-performing mutual funds have
bought your stock in the last reporting period. You also want your stocks
to have increasing institutional sponsorship over the last several quarters.
15. The company should have an excellent, new, superior product or ser-
vice that is selling well. It should also have a big market for its product
and the opportunity for repeat sales.
16. The general market should be in an uptrend and be favoring either small-
or big-cap companies. (If you don’t know how to interpret the general
market indexes, read IBD’s“The Big Picture” column every day.)
17. Don’t mess around with options, stocks that trade in foreign markets,
bonds, preferred stocks, or commodities. It doesn’t pay to be a “jack-of-all-
trades” or to overdiversify or engage in too much asset allocation. Either
avoid options outright or restrict them to 5% or 10% of your portfolio.
18. The stock should have ownership by top management.
19. Look mainly for “new America” entrepreneurial companies (those with
a new issue within the last eight or ten years) rather than too many lag-
gard, “old America” companies.
20. Forget your pride and your ego; the market doesn’t care what you think
or want. No matter how smart you think you are, the market is always
smarter. A high IQ and a master’s degree are no guarantee of market
success. Your ego could cost you a lot of money. Don’t argue with the
market. Never try to prove you’re right and the market is wrong.
21. ReadInvestor’s Cornerand“The Big Picture”in IBD daily. Learn how
to recognize general market tops and bottoms. Read up on any com-
pany you own or plan to buy; learn its story.

22. Watch for companies that have recently announced they are buying
back 5% to 10% or more of their common stock. Find out if there is
new management in the company and where it came from.
23. Don’t try to buy a stock at the bottom or on the way down in price, and
don’t average down. (If you buy the stock at $40, don’t buy more if it
goes down to $35 or $30.)
Key Reasons People Miss Buying Big Winning Stocks
1. Disbelief, fear, and lack of knowledge. Most big winners are newer
companies (with IPOs in the last eight or ten years). Everyone knows
Sears and General Motors, but most people are simply unaware of or
unfamiliar with the hundreds of new names that come into the market
every year. The new America names are the growth engine of America,
creating innovative new products and services plus most of the new
technology. (A chart service is one easy way to at least be aware of the
basics of price, volume, sales, and earnings trends of all these com-
pelling younger companies.)
2. P/E bias. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the best stocks rarely sell at
low P/Es. Just as the best ballplayers make the highest salaries, the bet-
ter companies sell at better (higher) P/Es. Using P/Es as a selection cri-
terion will prevent you from buying most of the best stocks.
3. Not understanding that the real leaders start their big moves by selling
near or at new price highs, not near new lows or off a good amount
from their highs. Investors like to buy stocks that look cheap because
the stocks are lower than they were a few months ago, so they buy
stocks on the way down. They think they are getting bargains. They
should be buying stocks that are on the way up, just making new price
highs as they break out of a proper base or price consolidation area.
4. Selling too soon, either because they get shaken out or because they are
too quick to take a profit, and psychologically having a hard time buy-
ing back a stock at a higher price if necessary. They also sell too late, let-
ting a small loss turn into a devastating one by not cutting all their losses
at 8%.
One Final Thought
You can definitely become financially independent once you learn to save
and invest properly. My parting advice: have courage, be positive, and don’t
ever give up. Great opportunities occur every year in America. Get yourself

prepared, study, learn, and go for them. What you’ll find is that little acorns

Anyone can do it. You can do it.

Success Stories
Over the course of 25 years and counting, Investor’s Business Dailyhas heard
from countless readers who have experienced life-changing financial suc-
cess because of the CAN SLIM and IBD method. The following is a small
sample of the thousands of success stories we’ve received over the years
from people of all ages and experience levels. It’s a powerful testament to
the fact that with a little hard work, patience, and dedication, anyone can
learn to follow this system to improve their results.
Market Timing
“IBD is a proven and no-nonsense approach to investing. This system has
helped me find the big winners in a market rally, and more importantly, it
has helped me avoid the big losses in a market downturn. This, in turn, has
allowed me to retire in my early fifties, spend more time with my family,
work on my hobbies and interests, and generally lead a very happy life.”
Michael A., Florida, Retired
“I shared IBD’s ‘Big Picture’ recommendation to trim equity holdings and
raise cash in December 2007 with my “smart friends” (attorney and financial
services manager). I reiterated the fact that IBD had had the same market
call in January 2000. While my friends and colleagues were chasing finan-
cials (see falling knife), my wife and I were able to buy quality CAN SLIM
stocks at proper breakpoints. Suffice it to say that my wife and I have had a

great year being in cash for most of 2008. Thanks, IBD! Rest assured, you
may have two more subscribers on the way!!!”
Ken C., California, Financial Advisor
“I’ve been a follower of IBD for around 17 years. A serious follower for the
last four years. In 2007, I achieved a return of +56% in my trading account,
and I broke even in 2008 by staying out of the market for most of the year.
The system has never failed me. The paper’s content, format, and teachings
have only gotten better over the years.”
Eric M., Illinois, Engineer
“I have been a reader of IBD since 2005 and have profited immensely from
it. Also, I have attended more than five IBD workshops from level 1 to level
3, and each has made me a better disciplined investor. The CAN SLIM sys-
tem, a system that works great whether in good times or bad times.”
Rajesh S., Texas, Electrical Engineer
“I’d like to take a moment to thank IBD for the ‘Big Picture’ and the ‘Mar-
ket Outlook.’ I’m a federal employee with a 401(k) plan called the Thrift
Savings Program. We are limited to five basic funds. The government or ‘G’
Fund is invested in government securities and is our safe haven. The ‘C’
Fund is our S&P 500 stock fund, the ‘F’ Fund is our commercial bond fund,
the ‘S’ Fund is our small-cap fund, and finally the ‘I’ fund is our international
fund. By using the ‘Big Picture’ and ‘Market Outlook,’ I was able to follow
the general market trend and move all of my retirement funds out of the
market and into a cash position in the ‘G’ fund. While most of my coworkers
suffered huge losses in the market and the market in general lost over 35%,
my total return for 2008 was up 4%. I simply check the ‘Big Picture’ every
day and move my money either into or out of the market using ‘Market Out-
look’ information. Again, thanks for your hard work.”
Brian D., Florida, Supervisory Special Agent
No Opinions, Only Facts
“In describing IBD, I would say it is without doubt one of the best sources
of information for investors that is available for the money. You don’t get any
‘Wall Street’ spin on the markets from IBD. It gives you the straight stuff. By
that, I mean IBD tells you the truth about the markets, economy, political
events, etc., that affect the markets, whether positive or negative. That is
huge in this climate because there is a lot of ‘Financial Nonsense’ being fed
to investors by too many unreliable sources these days. IBD tells investors
the truth. You can count on it!”

“IBD and Investors.com let you focus on what the market is actually doing
at any given moment, allowing you not to have to listen to all the noisy for-
tune tellers on the tube.”
Norm D., California, Individual Investor
“IBD is a tremendous time-saver. I make it a part of my daily process to read
IBD every business day, even if I do not read anything else. It is a great way
to quickly get a feel for the general market direction, continue to remain
educated, and learn about the secrets of success that keeps me motivated.
Where else can you get that in about 15 minutes a day? It is an extraordinary
publication!”
George M., California, Executive
“To me, Investor’s Business Dailyis an outstanding market analysis resource
because it is based on objective empirical research that cuts through pundit
opinions and personal emotions in buying and selling stock. Its greatest
strength is its direct, clear-thinking presentation of market-relevant news
that leaves often confused approaches of other publications behind.”
Allen A., Connecticut, Ph.D.
CAN SLIM
“Since I started using CAN SLIM and IBD, and now Investors.com, I was
able to make 359% on my original investment! IBD has so many features
that help me find the great stocks. I’m grateful for all the work you do to
help investors.”
Barbara J., California, Individual Investor
“Just studying IBD and CAN SLIM shows that if you really apply yourself
properly, you can succeed. You don’t have to be at the mercy of so-called
experts who really aren’t. I don’t like the intimidation tactics or the pressure
tactics of the money managers. There are no guarantees in investing, but
with IBD and CAN SLIM, the odds are on your side.”
Carol T., Massachusetts, Anesthesiologist
“I have been trading stocks full time since 2003, thanks largely to William
O’Neil’s How to Make Money in Stocks and IBD. I have reread the book
many times and am rereading it again. It is full of different-color marks, as
each time I read it I find something new and useful. I must say, How to Make
Money in Stocks, the IBD subscription, and the online tools are essential to
successful stock trading. Just like people grab their family photo albums
from the house on fire, if I were to pick just one thing to assure my contin-
ued success in stock trading, it would be William O’Neil’s How to Make
Money in Stocks.”

Proven Rules
“Investors Business Daily is a source for useful and accurate information
about how the market works. I have found that following the buy and sell
rules works. If you follow those seemingly simple but at times hard to follow
rules, you will make money.”
Herb M., Michigan, Individual Investor
“It was only when I started properly applying the IBD sell rules that I realized
the power to not only cut losses short, but stay away when conditions are not
good for making money. A day without IBD is a day of missed opportunity.”
Dennis H., Florida, Retired Broker
“I have done well in the market since 2003 by following IBD’s investment
rules. The only time I haven’t done well is when I violated those rules
because I got too big for my britches! When my friends ask me for market
advice, I just recommend a subscription to IBD and tell them to study the
paper every day, learn IBD’s rules for successful trading and stick to them,
and learn to read charts. Thanks to all at IBD and William O’Neil for pub-
lishing a great newspaper, the only paper I read now.”
Edward K., Arizona, Retired Doctor
“William O’Neil taught me the two rules that form the cornerstone of my
investing plan: (1) keep your losses small, and (2) average up, never down.
Those two simple rules have kept me out of a lot of trouble. When I have
strayed from them, it inevitably cost me money. Thank you, Bill, for all you
have done for the average investor.”
Peter M., California, Executive
Investor Education at Its Best
“I have gone to great lengths to learn about investing. I attended business
school as an undergraduate and graduate student, and worked for a retail
brokerage firm and for a small-cap research firm that supported institutional
clients. Even after all this experience, it wasn’t until I read How to Make
Money in Stocksthat I began to understand how to succeed in the market.”
Andrew M, New York, Vice President
“My students were participating in the Stock Market Game and struggling
with losses. Then they started using Investor’s Business Daily. IBD helped
my students reverse big losses and win third place in the Stock Market
Game. IBD has helped motivate my students to get great information in an
easy-to-use format. It’s given them the tools to research and make invest-
ment decisions, and become their own independent investors.”

“I’ve been a subscriber to Investor’s Business Daily since 1991. This is
investor education at its best. I fired my broker two weeks after I got IBD. I
told him I didn’t need him anymore. I trade over 150,000 shares each year.
I used to have no savings, but because of IBD, my net worth is well over 1
million dollars. I run it as a business. I’m just an average guy, I’m not a
genius, but I study a lot and use IBD. That’s how I succeed. It’s more than a
newspaper; it’s a working document.”
George G., Georgia, Pilot Trainer
“Investing in the stock market would be impossible for me without William
O’Neil’s incredible books, Investors Business Daily, and Investors.com. The
new additions to the newspaper are a terrific place to search for potential
buys in top sectors. I also look forward to watching the Daily Stock Analysis
andMarket Wrapvideos every day at Investors.com as part of my ongoing

“My stock life before IBD had no direction. I had no idea there was anything
to learn. Life after IBD opened my eyes, and my mind. I don’t ever expect
to stop learning!”
Marilyn W., Ohio, Retired
“Investing without the IBD is like trying to live without water. The IBD will
give you the proper structure to make informed and assessed decisions
about the general market or a particular stock issue, intelligently. I have
taught the principles of the paper to several hundred of my college students
over the past four years, and they have had fantastic results. They do not
invest without it, and neither do I.”
James D., Florida, College Instructor
“Spend a year learning everything there is to learn in IBD. It’s like getting
your doctorate in investing without going to four schools. It’s the easiest,
quickest way to become a savvy investor, regardless of how much you have
to invest.”

Fred B., New York, Arbitrator
“Since I started using CAN SLIM and IBD, and now Investors.com, I was
able to make 359% on my original investment! IBD has so many features
that help me find the great stocks. I’m grateful for all the work you do to
help investors.”
Kathleen P., California, Individual Investor
“I subscribed to Investor’s Business Dailyfor the first time after I retired. I
started using it for my stock portfolio because I wasn’t happy with my bro-
kers. With them, my portfolio was racking up losses. With IBD’s help, over
time I was able to get my portfolio back in the green with 20% and 30%
gains. I took a portfolio of $400,000 to $700,000 thanks to IBD. I love IBD.

John B., Illinois, Real Estate Broker
“By following IBD’s rules, I have quadrupled my account since May 2003.
IBD has also helped me remain flat this year in a severe bear market. The
best thing is that the rules are very easy to learn and follow, and I have lost
money only when I tried to put my own ‘wrinkles’ on them.”
Edward K., Arizona, Retired Doctor
“Thanks to Investors Business Daily and Mr. O’Neil’s CAN SLIM, my

“Between the dot-com bust and 9/11, my portfolio lost nearly half its value

it did not prevent my loss. I subscribed to Investor’s Business Daily and
found it much more informative on investing. Soon, I found myself reading
IBD rather than the WSJ. It was more to the point and was tailored to indi-

back. Using the knowledge I gained from IBD on reading stock charts and

Kenneth G., Michigan, Utility Planner
“I believe in results: I made my monthly salary in three days using IBD. I’m
a believer! I’ve looked at several investing sources. IBD and Investors.com
are the only ones that made me more money than I spent learning it.”
Kent J., California, Manager
“I sold a business, and after a couple of years with GS money management,
I decided that I must manage my money myself. It wasn’t long before we
realized that IBD is the only daily publication that sincerely wants to help
people make money in the market. That’s why we’re so loyal to the paper.
We don’t look at any other sources of information of any kind because it only
confuses the issue. It’s tough to shut down those media inputs. IBD has been
wonderful for us. It works very well, and every year we’re doing better
because we see the results in the portfolio. In our second year using IBD we
had a 26% gain, and it’s only gone up substantially since there.”
Michael D., California, Retired
“In 2006 I used a number of newly acquired CAN SLIM skills to buy into
Hanson Natural and to pyramid and force-feed my growing position to the
point where I had nearly 80% invested in HANS. Following CAN SLIM
principles, I sold my entire position May 11, 2006, for near perfect timing.
This one trade made my year and enough to cover for lean years the follow-

Tools That Work
“The ‘Big Picture’ keeps me focused on proper interpretation of general
market averages. I also use the IBD 100 for confirmation that stocks I might
be interested in are seen in the same light by the experts at IBD. I like the
entire B section: ‘Stocks on the Move’ shows where the action is; industry
group rankings let me know where to focus research; the stock research
tables grouped by leaders make it easy to see what stocks are leading. I could
keep going. The A section is excellent for keeping up on important news.
The paper is so well organized.”

Oldies but Goodies
The third edition of How to Make Money in Stocks featured IBD readers
who achieved investing results or shared how they learned to use the IBD
and CAN SLIM system. We thought we should reprint a few of these com-
ments in hopes they might provide helpful insights for you.
“Labor Day, 2001
Dear Mr. William O’Neil and Investor’s Business Daily,
As a huge enthusiast of Investor’s Business Daily and all of your written
material, I can’t write enough explaining how much your works have
changed my life.
I first came across How to Make Money in Stocks in the fall of 1997
through reading reviews of it on Amazon.com. I was living and teaching in
Guatemala at the time, and was looking to get involved in investing and the
stock market. Consequently, I ordered How to Make Money in Stocksand a
few other books, but it was your book, based on historical research, that
intrigued me the most. I reasoned that you had seen both great times and
rough times in your over 40 years of trading, while most other books had



==================================================

research based only from the 1990s. In addition to that, you used both tech-
nical and fundamental analysis rather than concentrating on just one
method. The other books I read advocated either one analysis or the other.
I was further convinced that your system of trading was for me when you
wrote how David Ryan and Lee Freestone had won U.S. Investing Champi-
onships using the CAN SLIM system.
What complements How to Make Money in Stocksperfectly is Investor’s
Business Daily. I had clipped out the coupon in the back of your book for a
free two-week subscription to IBD, and when I received the paper for the
first time, the whole system made sense to me. Finding the CAN SLIM
stocks was so much easier to do using IBD, and the paper had so many other
great articles, including Leaders & Success,The New America,Stocks in the
News, and my favorite, Investor’s Corner, that further enhanced my insights
into trading. I immediately subscribed to it, even though $180 was a lot for
me at the time. Then, even though the paper would arrive in Guatemala
three days late each day, I could still use its valuable information for
research.
I read everything I could in the paper and decided to use it in my profes-
sion of teaching. That year, as I was teaching English as a Second Language
in Guatemala, I also taught one class of fifth-grade gifted and talented
students.
I introduced them to IBD, and they ate it up. These students, and my
other students later, especially loved the stock tables because each stock is
graded like they are graded, using 1–99 and A through E or F. Students were
always coming up to me and saying things like, “Look at this one! It’s got a
99, 99, and AAA.” I have even taught my students to look for cups with han-
dles, and they have enjoyed the challenge of that, too.
I moved back to Denver in the summer of 1998 and continued using IBD
both personally and professionally. I had the same success here, with many
of the same student reactions as I did in Guatemala. Then, last year, during
the 2000–2001 school year, I taught a sixth- through eighth-grade after-
school business club. Using IBD, I helped my students participate in the
Denver Post annual stock market competition. One team, a group of two
Ethiopian boys and one boy from the Philippines, all of whom had only been
in America for a year, won second prize in the state! In fact, the only prob-
lem I’ve had using IBD in my classroom is when these students fought over
who got IBD’s “Your Weekend Review” section on Fridays.
As a result of this success utilizing IBD in my classroom, I have a lot of
other ideas for using IBD in education. If you ever think about creating a
curriculum outreach program, I’d love to share them with you. There is so
much in IBD that would be great for schools!
As far as my own investing, I still read IBD daily and subscribe to Daily
Graphs Online. I am more confident now and strongly feel that when this
bear slowly turns itself into a bull, I will be able to find and buy, at the pivot

point, the next Qualcomm, JDSU, or Qlogic. (The pivot point took me about
three years to completely appreciate!) At first, I was the typical beginner
with no discipline. I would cheat on the CAN SLIM rules, simply buying
anywhere and anytime regardless of what the chart showed. I also bought
Internet stocks simply because they were Internet stocks. And I tried many
other methods looking for instant profit and success. All in all, during my
first two years of investing, I “nickeled and dimed” my account to very low
points, dragging my ego down with it.
Finally, I disciplined myself and made a CAN SLIM checklist. I swore
that I wouldn’t violate any of the system’s rules. As a result, my successes
have increased. And even though the market during the last year and a half
has been rough, I did make a few nice trades, such as with Techne, Skech-
ers, International Gaming, and Direct Focus. I have read and reread Chap-
ter 10 [“When to Sell and Take Your Profit”] in How to Make Money in
Stocksabout 20 times so that I can remain focused for the next rally. I’ll be
shooting for the stars like you did from 1962 to 1963.
In conclusion, I would also like to express my appreciation for your love
and respect of America. I have taught and traveled in many countries, and it
is easy to say that America isn’t perfect, but I feel, as you do, that if you work
hard in America, great things will come. My father came to America as a
poor, young immigrant in 1950 and has built up a great mason business, all
through hard work. He always told me that if you work hard and remain pos-
itive, you can achieve anything you want. I feel that you and IBD express this
same sentiment every day. And believe it or not, I bought my father a sub-
scription to IBD for his birthday, and now he loves it, quotes from it, and
reads it every day!
Most importantly, however, I want to thank you for the great work you do
and the great information you print daily. It is greatly appreciated!
Sincerely,”

“Our son financed a trip around the world through his investing. A lot of the
knowledge he gained was learned from IBD. I would describe it as a tool in
your ongoing education on what investing can do for you. New investors
need to understand that education is what will take you forward . . . not a hot
stock tip. . . . IBD gives them that education.”
Michael G., Investor
“I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for making it possible
for me to invest in not only the various markets but the future of my family.
I have found your information to be interesting, easily understood, and,
when used correctly, profitable. The results have been the same for those of
my friends and family who have chosen to read and subscribe to IBD. Your
complete approach to investing is excellent, from mind-set to execution.
Whenever I have been able to successfully apply information/insight you
provide (industry, EPS/RS, chart pattern, etc.), I have traded successfully.
The greater my understanding of your information, the more successful the
trade. I have now been taught the tools to recognize when a trade may not
go as planned, and, most importantly, when to sell. That lesson alone has
been invaluable.”
Marilyn E.
“I saw Bill O’Neil on CNBC in the late 1980s and tracked his market calls,
and he was accurate! An eye-opener! In learning Mr. O’Neil’s CAN SLIM
system, my husband and I have been able to retire early and build the house
of our dreams, and look forward to years of travel in Europe . . . a life we
never dreamed we could achieve before we had IBD in our lives. We have
now happily become accustomed to annual 100% returns in our portfolio in
up markets and appreciate being safely on the sidelines in the bear markets.
