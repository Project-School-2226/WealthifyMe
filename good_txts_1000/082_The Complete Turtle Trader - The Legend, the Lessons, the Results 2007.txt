Preface
“Trading was more teachable than I ever imagined. Even though
I was the only one who thought it was teachable . . . it was teach-
able beyond my wildest imagination.”
Richard Dennis
This is the story of how a group of ragtag students, many with no Wall
Street experience, were trained to be millionaire traders. Think of
Donald Trump’s show The Apprentice, played out in the real world
with real money and real hiring and firing. However, these apprentices
were thrown into the fire and challenged to make money almost im-
mediately, with millions at stake. They weren’t trying to sell ice cream
on the streets of New York City. They were trading stocks, bonds, cur-
rencies, oil, and dozens of other markets to make millions.
This story blows the roof off the conventional Wall Street success
image so carefully crafted in popular culture: prestige, connections,
and no place at the table for the little guy to beat the market (and beat-
ing the market is no small task). Legendary investor Benjamin Graham
always said that analysts and fund managers as a whole could not beat
the market because in a significant sense they were the market. On top
of that, the academic community has argued for decades about effi -
cient markets, once again implying there is no way to beat market
averages.
Yet making big money, beating the market, is doable if you don’t
follow the herd, if you think outside the box. People do have a chance
to win in the market game, but he or she needs the right rules and
attitude to play by. And those right rules and attitude collide head-on
with basic human nature.
This real- life apprentice story would still be buried had I not ran-
domly picked up the July 1994 issue of Financial World magazine,

viii Preface
featuring the article “Wall S treet’s Top Players.” On the cover was
famed money manager George Soros playing chess. Soros had made
$1.1 billion for the year. The article listed the top one hundred paid
players on Wall Street for 1993, where they lived, how much they
made, and in general how they made it. Soros was first. Julian Robert-
son was second, at $500 million. Bruce Kovner was fifth, at $200 mil-
lion. Henry Kravis of KKR was eleventh at $56 million. Famed traders
Louis Bacon and Monroe Trout were on the list, too.
The rankings (and earnings) provided a crystal- clear landscape of
who was making “Master of the Universe” money. Here were, without
a doubt, the top players in the “game.” Unexpectedly, one of them just
happened to be living and working outside Richmond, Virginia, two
hours from my home.
Twenty- fifth on the list was R. Jerry Parker, Jr., of Chesapeake
Capital—and he had just made $35 million. Parker was not yet
forty years old. His brief biography described him as a former pupil of
Richard Dennis (who?) and noted that he was trained to be a “Turtle”
(what?). Parker was described as a then twenty- five- year- old accountant
who had attended Dennis’s school in 1983 to learn his “trend- tracking
system.” The article also said he was a disciple of Martin Zweig (who?),
who just happened to be thirty- third on the highest- paid list that year.
At that moment the name “Dennis” was neither more nor less impor-
tant than “Zweig,” but the implication was that these two men had
made Parker extremely rich.
I studied that list intently, and Parker appeared to be the only one in
the top hundred advertised as having been “trained.” For someone like
myself, looking for ways to try and earn that kind of money, his biogra-
phy was immediate inspiration, even if there were no real specifi cs.
Here was a man who bragged that he was a product of the “Virginia
boondocks,” loved country music, and preferred to keep as far away
from Wall Street as possible. This was no typical moneymaking story—
that much I knew.
The common wisdom that the only way you could find success was
by working in eighty- story steel- and- glass towers in New York, London,
Hong Kong, or Dubai was clearly dead wrong. Jerry Parker’s offi ce
was absolutely in middle of nowhere, thirty miles outside Richmond
in Manakin- Sabot, Virginia. Soon after reading the magazine, I drove

Preface ix
down to see his office, noting its lack of pretense, and sat in the parking
lot thinking, “You have got to be kidding me. This is where he makes
all that money?”
Malcolm Gladwell famously said, “There can be as much value in
the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.” Seeing Parker’s
country office was an electrical impulse for me, permanently dispelling
the importance of location. But I knew nothing else at the time about
Jerry Parker other than what was in that 1994 issue of Financial World.
Were there more of these students? How did they become students?
What were they taught? And who was this man Dennis who had taught
Parker and others?
Richard Dennis was an iconoclast, a wildcatting Chicago trader not
affiliated with a major investment bank or Fortune 500 firm. As the
“locals” were fond of saying on Chicago trading floors, Dennis “bet his
left nut.” In 1983, by the time he was thirty- seven, he’d made hundreds
of millions of dollars out of an initial grubstake of a few hundred. Den-
nis had done it on his own terms in less than fifteen years, with no for-
mal training or guidance from anyone. He took calculated risks
leveraging up huge amounts of money. If he liked a trade, he took all
of it he could get. He lived the markets as a “betting” business.
Dennis figured out how to profit in the real world from an under-
standing of behavioral finance decades before Nobel prizes were
handed out to professors preaching theory. His competitors could never
get a handle on his consistent ability to exploit irrational market behav-
ior throughout all types of markets. His understanding of probabilities
and payoffs was freakish.
Dennis simply marched to a different drum. He eschewed publicity
about his net worth even though the press speculated about it exten-
sively. “I find that kind of gauche,” said Dennis.1 Perhaps he was reti-
cent to focus on his wealth because what he really wanted to prove was
that his earning skills were nothing special. He felt anyone could learn
how to trade if taught properly.
His partner, William Eckhardt, disagreed, and their debate resulted
in an experiment with a group of would- be apprentice traders recruited
during 1983 and 1984 for two trading “classes.” That “Turtle” name? It
was simply the nickname Dennis used for his students. He had been on
a trip to Singapore and visited a turtle- breeding farm. A huge vat of

                     PAGE 12                      
==================================================

x Preface
squirming turtles inspired him to say, “We are going to grow traders just
like they grow turtles in Singapore.”
After Dennis and Eckhardt taught novices like Jerry Parker how to
make millions and the “school” closed, the experiment morphed into
word- of- mouth legend over the years supported by few hard facts.
The National Enquirer version of the story was captured in 1989 by a
Wall Street Journal headline, “Can the skills of successful trading be
learned? Or are they innate, some sort of sixth sense a lucky few are
born with?”
Since the 1980s are long past, many might wonder if the Turtles’
story still has relevance. It has more relevance than ever. The philoso-
phy and rules Dennis taught his students, for example, are similar to
the trading strategy employed by numerous billion- dollar-p lus hedge
funds. True, the typical stock- tip chaser glued daily to CNBC has not
heard this story, but the players on Wall Street, the ones who make the
real money, know.
The inside story has not been told to a wider audience until now
because Richard Dennis is not a household name today, and because
so much has happened on Wall Street since 1983. After the experiment
ended, the characters, both teachers and Turtles, went their separate
ways and an important human experiment fell through the cracks,
even though what took place is as significant today as then.
The effort to get the real story out there started to gain momentum
in 2004, when I was invited to visit Legg Mason’s headquarters in Bal-
timore following the release of my fi rst book, Trend Following. After
lunch, I found myself in a classroom on the top floor with Bill Miller,
the fund manager of the $18 billion Legg Mason Value Trust fund
(LMVTX). Beating the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index for fi fteen
years straight put him in a similar league as Warren Buffett. Miller, like
Dennis, had taken extraordinary calculated risks and more often than
not been proven right.2 On this day he was lecturing a roomful of eager
trainees.
Out of the blue, Miller invited me to the lectern to address his class.
The first questions, however, came straight from Miller and Michael
Mauboussin (Legg Mason’s chief investment strategist). They were,
“Tell us about Richard Dennis and the Turtles.” At that moment, I
realized that if these two Wall Street pros wanted to know more about

Preface xi
Dennis, his experiment, and the Turtles, it was clear a much larger
audience would want to hear the story.
However, as someone not there in 1983, I knew the task of telling
a complete story from an objective vantage, with so many competing
characters and competing agendas, was going to be a serious challenge.
Getting those who lived the experience to talk, coupled with sleuth-
like research to corroborate everything, was the only way to make this
story really come alive. That said, behind the scenes the soap opera of
those Turtles who worked hard to prevent this book’s publication is a
saga in itself.
Still, the biggest problem with a story like this is that most people
don’t want to actually understand how the real pros make big money.
They want the road to riches to be effortless. Look at the collective
public fascination with Jim Cramer—a man who is the polar opposite
of Richard Dennis and Jerry Parker. Cramer is no doubt intelligent, but
tuning into his extremely popular Mad Money TV show is like watch-
ing a traffic accident. There is a live studio audience that hoots and
hollers at Cramer’s fundamentally driven buy signals and wild prop-
smashing antics. In one word: bullshit.
That said, a lot of people, many highly educated, believe that
Cramer’s way is the way to get rich. Instead of employing a statistical
thinking toward market decisions, the general public keeps investing
based on impulsive “feelings,” letting an assortment of emotional bi-
ases rule their lives. In the end, to their detriment, people are always
risk- adverse toward gains, but risk- seeking toward losses. They are
stuck.
The average newbie investor’s method for success is not pretty. He
gets in because his friends are doing it. Then the news media start up
the stories of little guys doing well during a bull market. They all start
to “invest” by picking stocks with “low” prices. As the market roars in
their favor, thoughts of crashes never enter their mind (“With all the
money in there, it could never go down!”). They never see their own
slaughter coming, even though their market bubble is never different
from past ones.
The media tell us that average investors now supposedly understand
the concept of risk, yet worrying about possibilities while ignoring
probabilities is at epidemic levels.3 People gamble away fortunes on

money- losing hunches or double down when logic says to fold. At the
end of a lifetime they are never any closer to learning how to do it right.
But outside of the herd there are the special few, who have the un-
canny knack for knowing when to buy and sell, combined with an un-
canny knack to properly assess risk.4
Richard Dennis mastered that uncanny knack by his early twenties.
Unlike the general public wedded to their “feelings” to make decisions
Dennis used mathematical tools to calculate risk and used it to his ad-
vantage. What he learned and what he taught students never resem-
bled Jim Cramer barking stock tips. More important, Dennis proved
that his ability to make money in the markets was not luck. His stu-
dents, mostly novices, made millions for him and themselves.
What was the real story, and how did the Turtles learn their craft?
What trading rules were they taught, and how can an average trader or
investor use those insights today in his portfolio? What happened to
them after the experiment, in the ensuing years? Finding the answers
to those questions, with and without Dennis and his students’ coopera-
tion, has kept me passionately curious since 1994.
I am not alone in that curiosity. As author Steve Gabriel wrote on
Yahoo! Finance recently, “The experiment has already been done that
shows that we can all learn to trade for a living if we want to. That is
why the ‘Turtles’ matter.” The Turtles are an answer to the age- old
question of nature versus nurture, the living proof of the single most
famous Wall Street school for making money.

Nurture versus Nature
“Give me a dozen healthy infants and my own specific world to
bring them up in, and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random
and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—
doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant, chef and yes, even beggar and
thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities,
vocations, and race of his ancestors.”
John B. Watson,
early twentieth-c entury American psychologist
In the early 1980s, when Chicago’s reigning trader king, Richard Den-
nis, decided to conduct his real- life social experiment, Wall Street was
heating up. The stock market was at the start of a huge bull market.
On the world stage, Iraq had invaded Iran. Lotus Development
had released Lotus 1-2-3, and Microsoft had put their new word pro-
cessing program (“Word”) on the market. President Reagan, much
to the liberally minded Dennis’s chagrin, declared it “The Year of the
Bible.”
In order for Dennis to find his special breed of student guinea
pigs, he circumvented conventional recruitment methods. His fi rm,
C&D Commodities, budgeted $15,000 for classified ads in the Wall
Street Journal, Barron’s, and the International Herald Tribune seeking
trainees during late fall 1983 and 1984. Avid job seekers saw this:
Richard J. Dennis
of C&D Commodities
is accepting applications for the position of
Commodity Futures Trader
to expand his established group of traders.

Mr. Dennis and his associates will train a small
group of applicants in his proprietary trading con­
cepts. Successful candidates will then trade solely
for Mr. Dennis: they will not be allowed to trade fu­
tures for themselves or others. Traders will be paid
a percentage of their trading profits, and will be al­
lowed a small draw. Prior experience in trading will
be considered, but is not necessary. Applicants should
send a brief resume with one sentence giving their
reasons for applying to:
C&D Commodities
141 W. Jackson, Suite 2313
Chicago, IL 60604
Attn: Dale Dellutri
Applications must be received by October 1, 1984.
No telephone calls will be accepted.
Lost in the back pages of national dailies, the ad attracted surpris-
ingly few respondents when you consider what Dennis was offering.
But then, people don’t usually expect the road to riches to be in plain
sight.
The ad invited anyone to join one of C hicago’s most successful trad-
ing firms, making “experience” optional. It was as if the Washington
Redskins had advertised open positions regardless of age, weight, or
football experience.
Perhaps most stunning was that C&D Commodities was going to
teach proprietary trading concepts. This was unheard of at the time
(and still is today), since great moneymaking trading systems were al-
ways kept under lock and key.
Dennis’s recruitment process took place long before the chain-
reaction flow of Craig’s List ads that attract in thousands of résumés
within hours for any job. However, it was 1983, and reaching out to
touch the world with the flick of a blog post was not yet reality.
Potential students who were ultimately hired recall being stunned.
“This can’t be what I think it is” was a common refrain. It was, unbe-

Nurture versus Nature 3
lievably, an invitation to learn at the feet of Chicago’s greatest living
trader and then use his money to trade and take a piece of the profi ts.
One of the greatest educational opportunities of the century garnered
responses ranging from a sentence written on a coconut to the mun-
dane “I think I can make money for you.” Let’s face it, guessing what
would make a wealthy, reclusive, and eccentric trader take notice of
you in order to get to the next step—a face-t o-f ace interview—had no
precedent.
This casting of a wide net was all part of Dennis’s plan to resolve his
decade-l ong nature-v ersus-n urture debate with his partner William
Eckhardt. Dennis believed that his ability to trade was not a natural
gift. He looked at the markets as being like Monopoly. He saw strate-
gies, rules, odds, and numbers as objective and learnable.
In Dennis’s book, everything about the markets was teachable, start-
ing with his very first prerequisite: a proper view of money. He d idn’t
think about money as merely a means to go buy stuff at the mall, the
way most people do. He thought of money as a way to keep score. He
could just as easily have used pebbles to keep count. His emotional at-
tachment to dollars and cents appeared nonexistent.
Dennis would say, in effect, “If I make $5,000, then I can bet more
and potentially make $25,000. And if I make $25,000, I can bet that
again to get to $250,000. Once there, I can bet even more and get to a
million.” He thought in terms of leverage. That was teachable in his
book, as well.
On the other hand, William Eckhardt was solidly rooted in the na-
ture camp (“either y ou’re born with trading skills or y ou’re not”). Den-
nis explained the debate, “My partner Bill has been a friend since high
school. We have had philosophical disagreements about everything
you could imagine. One of these arguments was whether the skills of a
successful trader could be reduced to a set of rules. That was my point
of view. Or whether there was something ineffable, mystical, subjec-
tive, or intuitive that made someone a good trader. This argument had
been going on for a long time, and I guess I was getting a little frus-
trated with idle speculation. Finally, I said, ‘Here is a way we can defi -
nitely resolve this argument. Let’s hire and train people and see what
happens.’ He agreed. It was an intellectual experiment.”1
Even though Eckhardt did not believe traders could be nurtured,

                     PAGE 20                      
==================================================

4 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
he had faith in the underdog. He knew plenty of multimillionaires
who had started trading with inherited wealth and bombed. Eckhardt
saw them lose it all because they didn’t feel the pain when they were
losing: “You’re much better off going into the market on a shoestring,
feeling that you can’t afford to lose. I’d rather bet on somebody starting
out with a few thousand dollars than on somebody who came in with
millions.”2
The ramifications of Dennis and Eckhardt’s intellectual experiment
opened a Pandora’s box of opinions and biases. Measuring and judging
people by their IQ board scores, LSAT, GPA, degrees, or whatever
other metric, is the way most of society operates. Yet if an IQ measure
or test score was the only ticket needed for success, then all smart peo-
ple would be loaded, which is obviously not the case.
Stephen Jay Gould, the late great American paleontologist, evolu-
tionary biologist, and historian of science, was always quick to eschew
society’s misconceptions about intelligence: “We like to think of Amer-
ica as a land with generally egalitarian traditions, a nation conceived in
liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”3
However, Gould saw America slipping toward measures and ratios as a
sole means of predicting life success and was appalled at the increasing
predilection of Americans to use a hereditarian interpretation of IQ as
a limiting tool.4
Dennis, like Gould, was not about to be taken in by a hereditary
interpretation of IQ. His aim was to implant his mental software into
the brains of his students, and then place them into his controlled en-
vironment to see how they would react and perform.
That someone of Dennis’s stature and success would be so deter-
mined to prove nurture over nature that he would teach his proprietary
trading methods to others was extraordinary. Certainly his partner was
surprised that he was willing to put so much of his own money in the
hands of amateurs.
With a dark beard and sideburns and a receding hairline, William
Eckhardt bore an uncanny resemblance to Lenin and cut a sinewy,
energetic figure, the polar opposite of the over- six-f oot-t all rotund Den-
nis. Of the two, he was the true mathematician, with a m aster’s in
mathematics from the University of Chicago and four years of doctoral
research in mathematical logic. But for the purpose of their nature-

==================================================

Nurture versus Nature 5
versus-n urture debate, Eckhardt was the unapologetic biological deter-
minist, certain that his partner was a savant, an introverted genius with
special genetic talents.
Today, there are plenty of people who would still argue against Den-
nis, insisting that “biological determinism,” or the notion that genetics
predicts the physical and behavioral nature of an organism, can’t be
overcome.5 That’s bad news for a potentially successful trader or entre-
preneur in any field who doesn’t have the so- called pedigree or right
IQ score. The irony is that even though Dennis’s experiment proved
otherwise over twenty years ago, success in the markets is still perceived
by many as a virtual IQ caste system.
Skeptics of Dennis’s Turtle experiment have long rolled out barrages
of excuses about how serendipitous answering that little ad was. They
argue it would have been impossible for anyone, except insiders, to
have known that ad was the ticket to cracking Wall Street’s Top 100
paid traders (like Jerry Parker did). How could anyone know that an
ad could potentially bypass what Warren Buffett has affectionately
called “the ovarian lottery” and give a random group of people the
chance to make millions? It’s hard to accept that fact. It’s too much like
a Hollywood script.
It’s a Small World
Richard Dennis wanted a mishmash of personalities, similar to MTV’s
Real World and their diverse casting calls. He selected both far-r ight-
wing conservatives and bleeding-h eart liberals. A high school graduate
and an MBA were picked from the thousand- plus applicants who threw
their hats into the ring. The wild cross-s ection of his final Turtle picks
demonstrated Dennis’s diversity desires.
There were college graduates from the State University of New York
at Buffalo (business), Miami University in Ohio (economics), the New
England Conservatory of Music (piano, music theory), Ferrum Col-
lege in Virginia (accounting), Central Connecticut State University
(marketing), Brown University (geology), the University of Chicago
(Ph.D. in linguistics), Macalester College (history), and the United
States Air Force Academy.
Others Dennis students had recently held jobs at Cushman/Wake-

field (security guard), Caterpillar Tractor (salesperson), Collins Com-
modities (broker), the Ground Round Restaurant (assistant manager),
A.G. Becker (phone clerk), Palomino Club (bartender), and Dungeons
and Dragons (board game designer). One student simply declared his
status as “unemployed.” Earlier job histories of those who made the fi -
nal cut were even more mundane: kitchen worker, teacher, prison
counselor, messenger, accounting assistant, and waiter.
Dennis selected one woman from the ad, a rarity in the 1980s “all
boys” world of Chicago trading. He also selected gay students, whether
he knew their orientation at the time or not. His picks ran the gamut
from mild-m annered, professional academics to regular- guy blue- collar
types, to some with wildly volatile personalities.
There were certain things Dennis was looking for. He wanted stu-
dents who showed a willingness to take calculated risks. Those who
stood out from the herd in some kind of an unconventional way had a
leg up. This wasn’t a normal hiring process in the early 1980s, nor
would it be normal now. Today, MBA types, for example, are geared to
the intellectual rigors of running a company but are reluctant to get
their hands dirty. They are the ones who think IQ and connections are
all they need. They don’t want to do the hard work. They don’t want to
really take a risk.6
Dennis didn’t want those people. He was searching for people who
enjoyed playing games of chance. He was looking for people who could
think in terms of “odds.” Think like a Vegas “handicapper”? You were
more likely to get an interview. None of this was surprising to those
who knew Dennis. Reacting to opportunities that others never saw was
how he marched through life.
With a story like this, it’s not hard to imagine the legend that has
built up over the years. The experiment has inspired a cultlike rever-
ence, often passed along by word of mouth. However, Charles Faulkner,
a modeler of great traders, was instantly struck by the deeper meaning
of Dennis’s experiment. He wondered how Dennis knew, saying, “I
would have sided with Bill’s skepticism. Even if . . . it was teachable, it
certainly should have taken more effort and a much longer time than
Dennis allowed for learning it. The experiment, and more signifi cantly
the results, violated all of my beliefs around effort and merit and re-
ward. If something was that easy to learn, it shouldn’t pay so well and

vice versa. I marveled at the range of thinking, awareness, and infer-
ence, this implied.”
Dennis and Eckhardt taught their students everything they needed
in only two weeks to trade bonds, currencies, corn, oil, stocks, and all
other markets. Their students did not learn to trade from a screaming
mosh pit on the trading floor with wild hand signals, but rather in a
quiet office with no televisions, computers and only a few phones.
Each student received $1 million to trade after his classroom in-
struction. They were to get 15 percent of the profits, while Dennis got
85 percent. No surprise that he would get the lion’s share; it was, after
all, his money.
Dennis was honest about taking the majority of the profits when he
said in November 1983, right before launching the experiment, that
there would be no charity involved. He viewed the experiment as a way
to diversify his portfolio. While he knew his “no experience necessary”
students could be wiped out, he viewed it all as a way to gain more
control of how his millions were being put to use, saying, “I’m tired of
investing in someone else’s condominium in Timbuktu.”7
Replacing condo investment ideas with a group of surrogates was
a smart move. Many of his students went on to make 100 percent
or more per year over four years. That’s monster moneymaking. Even
more important than those successes from the early 1980s is the current
track record of three of the participants. Long after the experiment’s
ending, Eckhardt, along with two of D ennis’s former pupils, Jerry
Parker and Paul Rabar, manage in excess of $3 billion in 2007. They
still trade in a very similar fashion to how they did back in the day.
Beyond Turtles- related successes, there are hundreds of others, trad-
ers of big achievements, who owe a debt of gratitude to Dennis for
sharing his knowledge and experience. Additionally, men considered
to be trading peers of Dennis (not trained by him), men of similar
macro trading backgrounds such as Bruce Kovner, Louis Bacon, and
Paul Tudor Jones, are to this day regularly the highest paid on Wall
Street.
Of course, the $3 billion traded by Dennis’s trading progeny d oesn’t
seem that large when headlines today scream out with stories of new
hedge funds launched with billions out of the gate. When Jon Wood,
formerly of UBS, started his new fund with more than $5 billion and

when Jack R. Meyer, the former investment manager of Harvard Uni-
versity’s assets, raised more than $6 billion for Convexity Capital, the
$3 billion from Dennis’s associates sounds less impressive.8
In fact, some argue that Dennis’s “lack of pedigree” approach has
been passed by. One recent story profiled a twenty- seven- year- old trader
from Goldman Sachs. A “well- bred” product of Massachusetts’s tony
Deerfield Academy and Duke University, he was described as having
all of the ingredients of a grade- A trader. One of his peers gushed. “He’s
smart, competitive, and a hard worker. Keep your eye on this kid.”9
That praise has to be put into perspective. If a trader starts a career
with a prominent investment bank, he becomes valuable by using
Goldman Sachs’s money, offi ces, and connections. The access he has
sitting in the catbird seat at a top bank is a major secret of his success.
Investment banks were simply never the career paths of the great
entrepreneurial traders. That is why Dennis brings hope. Independent-
minded rebel traders, like him, never got to where they were by moving
up bureaucratic ladders. They did not bide their time for twenty years
engaging in office politics. Dennis and his peers were never part of a
Fortune 500 hierarchy. They had one objective: to make absolute-
return money trading the markets on their terms. It was high risk and
high reward.
Dennis’s Turtle experiment proved, all things being equal, that his
students could learn to trade to make millions. However, all things be-
ing equal, after they learned the “right” trading rules to make those
millions, if they did not exhibit, like Boston Red Sox slugger David
Ortiz does in baseball, a “walk- off home run” mentality every day, they
would fail. Great training alone was not enough to win for the long
run. In the end, a persistent drive for winning combined with a healthy
dose of courage would be mandatory for Dennis’s students’ long-t erm
survival.
Before getting into what really happened with the Turtles, who the
winners and losers were and why, it’s crucial to get acquainted with
what made Dennis tick in the first place. Knowing how a regular guy
from the South Side of Chicago made $1 million by the age of twenty-
five in the early 1970s and $200 million by the age of thirty-s even in
the early 1980s is the first step toward understanding why nurture
won out.

Prince of the Pit
“Great investors conceptualize problems differently than other
investors. These investors don’t succeed by accessing better in-
formation; they succeed by using the information differently than
others.”
Michael J. Mauboussin,
chief investment strategist of Legg Mason Capital Management
Nineteen eighty- six was a huge year for Richard Dennis. He made
$80 million (about $147 million in 2007 dollars). That kind of money-
making put him squarely at the center of Wall Street alongside
George Soros, who was making $100 million, and then junk bond
king Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert, who was pulling
in $80 million.1
Profits like those for Dennis came with heartburn. He was down $10
million in a single day that year before bouncing back, a roller- coaster
ride that would have made mere mortals lose serious sleep. Yet Dennis
cockily said that he slept like a baby during all that volatility.2
His moneymaking style was about mammoth home runs and many
smaller strikeouts. If there was a “secret,” he knew that you had to be
able to accept losses both psychologically and physiologically. Still,
1986 was a long time ago, and memories dull when an old pro starts
talking about the benefits of taking “losses.”
During his heyday in the 1970s, 1980s, and mid- 1990s, Dennis was
described in a number of ways by those who knew of him. There was
Dennis the legendary fl oor trader, Dennis the trading system’s trading
guru, Dennis who started funds with investment bank Drexel Burn-
ham, Dennis the philanthropist, Dennis the political activist, and Den-
nis the industry- leading money manager.3 He was a difficult man to
stereotype, and he liked it that way.

“Dennis the gambler” was the only label that offended him, because
he never considered himself a gambler in the Las Vegas sense. He un-
derstood financial Darwinism (read: “odds”) through and through. He
always played the “game” knowing that everyone else was out to beat
him. Financial futures pioneer Richard Sandor put Dennis in perspec-
tive: “The name of the game is survival when the markets are this cha-
otic. From that perspective, he may go down as one of the most
successful speculators in the 20th century.”4
Dennis’s success started long before he launched the Turtle experi-
ment. He grew up in Chicago during the 1950s, a street kid from the
old South Side neighborhoods. There was no privileged childhood
with wealthy parents and well- placed friends. He did not have a silver
spoon or the right connections.
The teenage Dennis was introverted and wore thick glasses and
polyester pants. His first stab at trading, while attending the all- boys’
St. Laurence Prep School in Chicago, was to buy ten shares of a
$3 “phonograph” stock. The company folded. While his fi rst attempt
at trading failed, he was a natural at poker, intuitively understanding
the odds.
His teachers did not forget him. James Sherman, who taught theol-
ogy and European history to Dennis, said that he never would take
anything at face value. Dennis and his friends enjoyed the mental
gymnastics of taking sides in an argument. Sherman added, “If some-
body had said back then that Richard Dennis would become a
very wealthy man as a commodity trader, I probably w ouldn’t have
believed them.” His former teacher would have predicted Dennis to
be in front of the fire, with a sweater and a pipe, expounding on the
cosmos.5
At seventeen, Dennis landed a summer job as a runner ($1.60 an
hour) at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Each day the exchange
floor was mobbed by hundreds of traders fighting and screaming to
place their trades. They were exactly like auctioneers buying and sell-
ing their wares except that they were in a trading pit battling it out.
An indoor game of tackle football would be a good description of the
scene.
Dennis longed to be there, but to trade on the floor you had to be
twenty-o ne. He found a way over that hurdle by talking his father into

trading for him. A blue-c ollar worker for Chicago’s city government,
the father became a proxy guided by his son’s hand signals from the
sidelines.
Despite some trading success in his teens, Dennis headed off to
college at DePaul University, where his passion for philosophy (after
flunking out of an accounting class) from high school days was re-
kindled. He was most taken with British philosophers David Hume
and John Locke, who had a relatively simple way of viewing the world.
“Prove it to me” was their basic perspective.
Hume thought the mind a blank slate (tabula rasa) on which experi-
ence could be written. He believed that since human beings live and
function in the world, they should try to observe how they do so. Dis-
covering the causes of human belief was his key principle.6 Locke,
on the other hand, argued that there were no innate ideas. He asked
the question, “How is the mind furnished?” He wanted to know where
reason and knowledge came from. His answer was one word: “experi-
ence.”
Both Hume and Locke belonged to the school of thought known
as Empiricism. Empiricism is rooted in the notion that knowledge is
derived from experiment, observation, and experience. Little nuggets
of simple common sense from these two eighteenth- century British
philosophers connected with an impressionable college student. They
became his idols.
Dennis was not shy about his leanings, asserting, “I’m an empiricist,
through and through. David Hume and Bertrand Russell. I’m solidly
in the English tradition.” Dennis saw Hume as ruthlessly skeptical.
Hume took on the sacred cows of his generation, and Dennis loved
that attitude.7
It wasn’t only British philosophy that turned Dennis into a skeptic.
Growing up in the late 1960s and early 1970s gave him an anti-
establishment view of the world. He witnessed protesters being beaten
by the Chicago police during the 1968 riots, right next to the venerable
Chicago Board of Trade. It was a turning point in his life:
Trading has taught me not to take the conventional wisdom for
granted. What money I made in trading is testimony to the fact
that the majority is wrong a lot of the time. The vast majority

is wrong even more of the time. I’ve learned that markets, which
are often just mad crowds, are often irrational; when emotionally
overwrought, they’re almost always wrong.8
After graduating from DePaul University he received a fellowship
to Tulane University graduate school, but promptly dropped out and
returned to Chicago within days to start trading full time. Dennis
bought a seat on the MidAmerican Commodity Exchange with money
borrowed from his parents (part of it from a life insurance policy in
his name). He still needed cash to trade, however. His initial war chest
of $100 came from his brother Tom’s earnings delivering pizzas.
This was not a family of market operators. Dennis was always honest
about his father’s “hatred” of the market, explaining, “My grandfather
had lost all his money in the stock market in the Depression. The urge
to speculate kind of skipped a generation.” He knew his father’s per-
spective would never work for him:
You c an’t have a standard attitude about money and do well in
this business. What do I mean by that? Well, my father, for in-
stance, worked for the city of Chicago for 30 years, and he once
had a job shoveling coal. So, just imagine coming from his frame
of reference, and thinking about losing $50 in a few seconds
trading commodities. To him, that means another eight hours
shoveling coal. That’s a standard attitude about money.9
It didn’t take long for his father to recognize Dennis’s unique abil-
ities to make money. By the beginning of 1973, at twenty-f our, Dennis
had made $100,000. Around that time he cockily preached to the
Chicago papers, “I just wanted to be able to get up and say, ‘I once
made $100,000 a year, and I still think you are an ass.’ That rhetoric
may not be wholesome motivation, but I do think it’s part of what
drives me.”10 He was making so much money fast that whatever
the context or content of an interview, it was outdated in weeks or
even days.
A rebel at heart, Dennis cultivated being a character from the outset.
He was fond of saying that he never liked the idea of sharing a birthday

with Richard Nixon—a gentle stab at all those conservative traders sur-
rounding him in the pits on LaSalle Street. He was an anti- establishment
guy making a fortune leveraging the establishment, while wearing
jeans.
Society was splintered during the time Dennis earned his fi rst big
money. Nineteen seventy- four was a difficult year in which to focus.
What with G. Gordon Liddy having been found guilty of Watergate
charges and the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapping Patricia
Hearst, it was a wild time of constant turmoil. To top it off, Richard
Nixon became the first President of the United States to resign from
offi ce.
Current events did not stop Dennis from leveraging a 1974 run- up
in the price of soybeans to a $500,000 profit. By the end of the year, at
age twenty- five, he was a millionaire.11 Even though he downplayed his
success, he couldn’t hide it. When he showed up late one day to the
soybean pit explaining that his beat- up 1967 Chevy had broken down,
other traders gave him flack, knowing full well he could afford a new
car hundreds of times over.
Not only was his persona different, his trading was different. Dennis
read Psychology Today (no government economic or crop reports for
him) to keep his emotions in check and to remind him of how over-
rated intuition was in trading. He took delight in boasting, in contrast
to most traders who got up early to read all they could from weather
reports to daily Department of Agriculture assessments, that he stayed
in bed until the last minute before getting to the exchange just as trad-
ing started.12
At one point during this time, Dennis was in the middle of an in-
terview with a reporter as he went to the bank to make a deposit. He
was depositing a $325,000 check (in 1976, that represented two to
three weeks of work for him). Depositing an amount like that in the
mid-1 970s was not normal. Dennis always got hassled when he tried
to deposit checks that size.13 He was oblivious to the fact that that the
teller was looking at a check that likely would exceed her total career
earnings. Yet Dennis, probably younger than she was, c ouldn’t sign his
name straight.14
As his notoriety continued to grow, national newspapers like the

Chicago Tribune, the New York Times, and Barron’s trumpeted his
youth and success. This was not standard operating procedure in a
tight- lipped world where the big Chicago traders typically kept silent.
Dennis enjoyed and even reveled in his upbringing and the unique
perspective it afforded him:
I grew up in an Irish-C atholic family on the South Side of Chi-
cago. My institutional values were very strong, if somewhat con-
fused. My holy trinity consisted of the Catholic Church, the
Democratic Party, and the Chicago White Sox. I would describe
my early value system as nourishing, if limited. When my father
took me to Hurley’s Tavern, I saw people falling off their bar
stools—about what you’d expect from people who called whiskey
“Irish pop.”15
The Church, baseball, Democratic politics, and Irish drinking
weren’t only an influence on his youth:
How much of my holy trinity informs me as an adult? In the
White Sox I have a deep and abiding faith. In the Democratic
Party I have shallow and fading faith, which is almost never re-
warded. In the church, well . . . I fear 16 years of Catholic educa-
tion left me a skeptic.16
Look at that 1976 New York Times photo of the then twenty- six-
year-o ld multimillionaire, lounging on the couch with his dad seated
to his left, seemingly oblivious to the photographer, and it is easy to
see anti-e stablishment staring into the camera. The photo caption only
reinforced Dennis’s differences: “He drives an old, inexpensive car, he
dresses in cheap knits; his money tends to pile up, unused.”
However, all this press at such a young age left Dennis confronted
by something he probably wasn’t expecting: people with their hands
out, asking for money. “Most of them were very sad,” he recalled.
“One person said, ‘Help me to learn how to trade. I’m in debt.’ Some
people made it sound as if $5,000 or $10,000 were all they needed to
make them happy. Those were the only letters worth answering—to
explain that money won’t really make a difference.”17

==================================================

Prince of the Pit 15
Not many twenty- six- year- olds would have been mature enough to
handle the press using such folksy wisdom. Yet Dennis never let the
swirl around him interfere with what he was doing to make money.
Quite simply, his trading technique was to trade seasonal spreads. In
other words, he wanted to take advantage of seasonal patterns in mar-
kets like soybeans—his initial specialty. Dennis would hold “long”
(bets to profit as the market increased) and “short” (bets to profi t as the
market decreased) positions in futures contracts simultaneously in the
same or related futures markets.
The MidAm Exchange Experience
Once he had his MidAm seat (formerly called the Chicago Open
Board), Dennis was off and running. Initially he had no clue what he
was doing, but he was a fast learner who learned to think like a casino
operator:
When I started out, I had a system called “having no idea whatso-
ever.” For four years, I was just taking edges. If someone was giv-
ing me a quarter cent edge to buy an Oat contract, I didn’t think
he knew anything either. I just knew that I was getting a quarter
cent edge, and at the end of the day, the edges would approxi-
mately equal my profit. Obviously, on an individual basis that
doesn’t have to happen, but over a longer period of time, it will. I
tried to be like the house in the casino. It wasn’t that novel. Peo-
ple at the Board of Trade had been doing it forever. But for the
MidAm, it was kind of revolutionary because no one would un-
derstand that you could balance your risk with a lot of volume.
That’s how I started.18
Dennis went from zero to sixty on the MidAm in record time, and
no one knew how he learned to do what he was doing. He knew that
traders had a tendency to self- destruct. The battle with self was where
he focused his energies: “I think it’s far more important to know
what Freud thinks about death wishes than what Milton Friedman
thinks about defi cit spending.”19 Go down to Wall Street today after
work with the hot- shot traders all earning $500,000 a year at the big

banks and you’ll find very few who talk about Freud being the ticket to
making millions.
However, trading was harder than Dennis let on. The early ups and
downs took a toll on him, but he learned the hard lessons within
months. “You have to have mentally gone through the process of fail-
ure,” he said. “I had a day during which I made every mistake known
to modern man. I took too big risks. I panicked and sold at the bottom
of every break. I had built my net worth up to about $4,000 coming
into that day and I lost about $1,000 in two hours. It took me about
three days to work through that experience emotionally, and I think it
was the best thing that ever happened to me.”20
It was about this time, in 1972–73, that fellow traders Tom Willis
and Robert Moss met Dennis. They would go on to work together for
years as close friends and business associates, with Dennis as their
leader. The star did not wear a polished Armani suit, nor did his bud-
dies. They sported used-c ar-s alesman jackets, with muttonchops and
bad hair, but their appearance disguised calculated gamers looking to
beat the pants off their peers every day of the week.
Willis, like Dennis, was brought up in a working- class family. His
father, who worked first as a milkman and then delivering bread, helped
him buy a seat on the MidAm for $1,000 at age twenty- one. Willis had
never heard of the exchange until he saw an article in the Chicago
Tribune with the headline “Altruistic Grain Trader Successful.” It was
about 221⁄ 2-year- old Richard Dennis.
Willis immediately identified with his p eer’s anti-e stablishment way
of viewing the world. Dennis was not afraid to say that he had voted for
Eugene McCarthy and didn’t think that just because he had radical
ideas he should be driving a cab. Years later, Dennis was even more
direct, saying that “the market was a legal and moral way to make a liv-
ing. Being a trader doesn’t oblige one to be a conservative.”21
Yet Dennis’s political stance was not what first caught Willis’s atten-
tion; it was his attitude about making money in a world where class and
distinction were always barriers to entry. Without a second thought,
Willis hopped in his Jeep and drove to the Fisher Building in the Chi-
cago Loop to check out the exchange. When he arrived at the MidAm
for the first time, his soon-t o- be role model dominated the landscape:
“Rich was in the pit. I knew him by the photo from the Tribune.”

Prince of the Pit 17
Willis started trading with his MidAm seat, but had no immediate
contact with Dennis even though they were the two youngest traders in
the pit. Nearly everybody else was sixty- five to eighty years old, and they
actually had chairs and spittoons in the trading pit. A young Dennis,
towering above a sea of old guys lounging on chairs, must have been a
sight.
Situated only a few blocks from the Chicago Board of Trade, the
MidAm was a bit player at the time. It was small, perhaps fi fteen hun-
dred square feet. While Willis d idn’t know how his start at the MidAm
would unfold (he ended up building a thirty-p lus-y ear trading career),
he was certain Dennis saw a much bigger future.
Even then, big wigs from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME) were coming over in their limos to pick young Dennis’s mind.
Ultimately, Dennis approached Willis most likely because he was
good enough not to go broke and because they were both about the
same age.
Dennis told Willis, “If you’re buying wheat and it’s strong and the
beans are too low and the wheat is fi ve higher, why don’t you sell soy-
beans instead of selling the wheat you bought?” It was a very sophisti-
cated insight. In fact, buying “strength” and selling “weakness” short
still befuddles investors. It is counter- intuitive to buying low and
selling high.
Dennis was already sharing his knowledge with other traders. He
was a natural-b orn teacher. Dennis was teaching the young exchange
members at either his or W illis’s apartment. Willis would buy two hun-
dred pieces of chicken and a barrel of potato salad. There were fi fty or
sixty guys in his one-b edroom apartment with Dennis holding court,
explaining how to trade.
There was a practical need for this. The MidAm was selling new
memberships to all kinds of traders, many with no experience. Dennis
and Willis were teaching “liquidity.” To give the market confi dence in
the viability of the MidAm exchange, there had to be a critical mass of
buyers and sellers. This culture of education was creating a better ex-
change with better traders. And those better traders were starting to
make money. It could all be traced to Dennis.
Craig and Gary Lacrosse, Ira Shyman, John Grace, Wayne Elliott,
Robert Tallian, and David Ware are all Chicago traders who learned

from Dennis. While they may not be household names, they became
hugely successful in part because of the generosity of the young Den-
nis, who felt no compunction about sharing his skills with others.
After the apartment- training sessions everyone would go home, and
they would meet the next day in the pits. During market hours they
would ask Dennis, “Is this what you meant?” and he’d say, “Yeah.” Den-
nis freely gave away his knowledge.
The Chicago Board of Trade
Great experiences and profits aside, it wasn’t long before Dennis
needed a bigger playing field than the minor-l eague MidAm. He was
already plotting how to beat the big boys at the Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT), the world’s largest futures exchange. Once at the CBOT,
his placid demeanor contrasted sharply with the hoarse shouts and wild
gestures of other floor traders, many of whom were millionaire traders
with decades of experience. He was soon beating them at their own
game with a “betting” style that was often so relaxed that his trading
cards would literally slip out of his hand onto the fl oor.
Dennis’s move to the CBOT was historic. Willis could hardly be-
lieve it: “Richard goes to the Board of Trade and knocks the cover off
the ball. They’ve never seen anything like this. I mean this kid takes the
whole pit off. Not because he can or not because he wants to show off,
but corn is up, beans are up two and the corn is down three and they
sell him a million bushels of soybeans up one and a half and the next
thing you know they close up seven and they’re talking about him,
‘Who’s this new kid?’ ” Willis refrained from divulging the names of
old-t imers that Dennis was beating the pants off when he first hit the
CBOT, since many of those losing traders are still around today.
One of Dennis’s students said that their teacher believed his physical
attributes to be behind his pit- trading success: “You ever heard why he
considered himself really successful? He is six feet something and the
size of a freight train. He could see over people and more importantly,
people could see him. People always knew that he was there. He hon-
estly felt that’s why he was successful.”
Dennis’s attributing his height and weight as the reason he was suc-
cessful is not the full story. There was more to becoming a millionaire

by twenty- five than being “six foot something” and three hundred
pounds plus. Even with excess weight, his peers described him as hav-
ing cat- quick reflexes on the trading fl oor.
The Move from the Pit
Trading on the floor, down in the pit, might have been exciting during
this era, but today the Chicago Board of Trade floor is silent. That
doesn’t mean trading is dead today—far from it. Electronic trading out-
dated the old ways faster than anyone ever thought could happen.
However invigorating the trading floor may have been in the 1970s,
the only way for Dennis to expand his trading success was to move
away from it. The Chicago trading floors were designed with multiple
pits and each pit traded a different market. To trade more than
one market, he had to physically move back and forth across the fl oor
to the various pits.
Dennis’s solution allowed him to remain faithful to buying in
strength and selling in weakness. He knew that if his system worked in
soybeans and corn, then it would also work in gold and stocks and all
other markets.
At the same time, he saw Wall Street changing, with new markets
appearing fast and furiously as economies around the world opened and
expanded. Fixed income futures were launched, and by 1975 the Inter-
national Monetary Market (IMM) was allowing anyone to trade curren-
cies the way they did stocks. Dennis knew what this would all mean.
To trade in that bigger world, Dennis moved into an office on the
twenty- third floor of the CBOT, leaving the turmoil of screaming trad-
ers behind. Concurrent with his move, in November 1975, Dennis and
Larry Carroll formed a partnership. Known simply by the first initial of
their last names, C&D Commodities was born.
There is little public information on Larry Carroll (they did meet on
the MidAm floor). And, although D ennis’s “D” came second, theirs
was not a partnership where the decisions and profits were split fi fty-
fifty. Dennis was always the man. Within short order, C&D Commod-
ities became one of the largest independent trading firms in the world.
They quickly rivaled such established institutional investors as Salo-
mon Brothers and the Pillsbury Company.22

However, other traders who had seen him dominate the pits were
shocked when Dennis left the floor. They thought he was crazy. To
compete against the likes of Pillsbury and Salomon Brothers was
considered suicide, because no one thought he could maintain that
floor “edge.” Dennis himself had always said the pit was the safest
place to be.
The transition did almost sink Dennis. When he went off fl oor, he
struggled. In the late 1970s, the markets were getting to him. Tom Wil-
lis saw the struggle and recalled, “He was a little disillusioned, a little
off balance frankly.” Both men went out to a bar to discuss the situa-
tion. Dennis was not throwing in the towel. He looked at Willis and
said, “Tom, I got stuff that’s so good that used off floor in the right
hands it would make $50 million a year.”
In today’s terms, this would be like someone saying he has a way of
trading that’s so good he can make $200 million a year. Or think of
some number that is fifty times more than is rationally achievable by
any normal measure. With anyone else, Willis would have been skep-
tical: “If I didn’t know Rich. I would have said, ‘Gee, he really does
sound a little more off balance than I’m even thinking.’ Saying $50
million in 1979 is a crazy thing to do, but I believed it. And he did it.
If an edge is good or the idea is good, let’s get in front of the screen
and trade them all. If it’s that good, l et’s get in front of the screen and
have 20 people do this. As a matter of fact, it’s very, very consistent to
expanding geometrically the ability to take advantage of this good
idea.”
The goal of trading every market he could and making more money
in the process was reached within a year, just as Dennis had predicted.
Yet making that much more money didn’t change him one bit. His
new office was not marble and glass. The outside hallway to the offi ce
had dingy brown paneling. On his office door was “C&D Commodi-
ties, Richard J. Dennis and Company.” No fl ash. The men’s room for
the floor was next door.
Martin Hare, a nephew of Larry Carroll’s, was sixteen and in high
school when he was working for Dennis. Now an executive with Mer-
rill Lynch in San Diego, he worked in Dennis’s unconventional offi ce
environment from 1982 to 1989. Hare still gets enthusiastic when he
thinks about his after- school job: “I cut out the Wall Street settlement

prices for three summers. My weekly salary at C&D was $120. That
was up from $90 the summer before. The C&D office was royal blue
in color. There was a sleeping room for those that needed to nap, mostly
for Rich, and a refrigerator full of the best beer.”
Dennis may have physically disappeared from the trading fl oor,
but the hermit- like trading wizard hovered over the markets like
Zeus. Everyone knew he was there when a huge order came into the
pits. Traders also knew not to get in front of his orders, or they could
be potentially wiped out. Critics and regulators at times thought he
was too big and moved markets unfairly. Dennis scoffed, “Sour
grapes.”
The criticisms were an excuse for people who had learned to lose.
Dennis had no patience for people targeting his success. “I cringe a
little when I’m identified as a millionaire,” Dennis said after reading
that his $250,000 contribution to Adlai Stevenson was the largest indi-
vidual political gift ever in Illinois. “If somebody just had $100,000, he
wouldn’t be called a thousandaire, and if a pauper gave a dollar, they
wouldn’t say, ‘Pauper gives his last buck.’ ”23
Although he grew wealthier by the day, he still kept an antinuclear
poster hanging in his offi ce and remained outside the chummy atmo-
sphere of the exchanges. He was not prone to travel in the limelight.
“We d on’t have much contact with him,” remarked one Board of Trade
player.24
While his peers collected vintage cars and mansions, Dennis kept
wearing those out-o f-d ate polyester pants hiked over an ever-e xpanding
waist. He exercised by eating cheap hamburgers at noisy grills. Dennis
in a short-s leeved shirt, no tie, religiously pouring over arcane base-
ball statistics from the Baseball Abstract, was a common sight. In
fact, he would eventually buy a piece of the White Sox baseball team.
Once he was an owner, his 1980s attempt to get White Sox manage-
ment to see the benefits of Bill James–style “Moneyball” fell on deaf
ears.
One of his students, Michael Shannon, watched his friends try to
dress him up by moving him from his South Side studio apartment,
and recalled, “Bill Eckhardt and others actually forced him to move
into something that was a little bit more parallel to his station.”
Money for Dennis was just a way to keep score in the game. He was

frank about it: “Trading is a little bit like hitting a ball. If you’re think-
ing what your batting average should be, you’re not concentrating on
the right thing when you bat the ball. Dollars are the batting average of
the trader.”25
This original thinker and big- time baseball fan left a visual image on
everyone. Several confi dantes talked about Dennis’s socks. One of his
students smiled, “You need to make sure he’s wearing a matched pair
of the same color.”
Bradley Rotter, a former West Point graduate and often called
Dennis’s first investor, witnessed his eccentricity: “I was at his house for
a Fourth of July tennis party and Richard Dennis couldn’t be found . . . at
the end of the party he came out of his house wearing a white tennis
shirt, white tennis shorts, and black shoes and black socks. I’ll never
forget that picture.”
Rotter was not mocking Dennis. He respected Dennis’s testicular
fortitude to trade trends no matter what. In baseball, testicular fortitude
means everyone can talk about the game, but if you’re going to get
into the game, you must swing the bat. Dennis swung and swung hard.
No singles. His was Babe Ruth, home- run, swing-f or-t he-f ences-s tyle
moneymaking.
However, the Babe Ruth of trading was near oblivious to the basics
of everyday life. Mail and personal bills were handled by C&D’s back
office because of his inattention. His office would even send over toilet
paper to his apartment. The weight room in his Gold Coast condo was
virtually unused. “I pat the weights once in a while.” said Dennis.26 He
enjoyed using a third of his time to do absolutely nothing.
Another Dennis student, Erle Keefer, went beyond his eccentrici-
ties: “Rich is probably the greatest trigger puller that I personally have
ever known: he has the ability under tremendous pressure to stand
there with his own money and pull the trigger when other people
wilted. And when he was wrong, he could turn on a dime. That’s amaz-
ing—that’s not trading, t hat’s genetic.” The genetic line was debatable;
after all, that was the point of his Turtle experiment.

Political Ambitions
Dennis’s success eventually caused more serious problems. In the mid-
1980s, critics accused him of strong-a rming the market. They blamed
him for too much market volatility. Words like “collusion” were thrown
around. Dennis was not buying it. He said, “One man’s volatility is
another man’s profi t.”27
When Dennis was a guest on a radio show in 1984, a caller assured
him that if he traded long enough, he would give it all back.28
You could feel the anger. Some people simply did not want to hear
about a young guy making millions. Even though everyone knew ex-
changes needed speculators, too many people didn’t want those same
risk- takers to make a profi t. Dennis himself appeared before Congress
as they investigated the “efficiency of the markets”—unable to defi ne
what that phrase meant. His detractors were silenced after government
regulators testifi ed that the total buying and selling by Dennis did not
breach exchange limits.
Soon, Dennis would join the political fight at a whole new level. He
became one of the largest Democratic donors in the country, often fo-
cusing his generosity on standard politicians and assorted underdogs.
From donating millions to battered w omen’s shelters to the decriminal-
ization of marijuana, causes without wide publicity appealed to him
(he would give away 10 percent of his earnings every year). While call-
ing himself a liberal libertarian, he once donated $1,000 to former
Black Panther Bobby Rush.
Dennis did more than just write checks. He became good friends
with Bill Bradley and supported Walter Mondale (1984) and Bruce
Babbitt (1988) for President. He lobbied hard against conservative stal-
wart Robert Bork. There was a rational justification in D ennis’s mind
for his political ideals: “If it’s something everyone hates but you think is
right, those are the important things to do because no one else is going
to do them.”29
However, becoming a successful politician on the basis of support-
ing the have- nots of society was not as easy as trading to make millions.
It wasn’t enough merely to fund his causes; Dennis also wanted to
“work” them, and immediately ran into roadblocks. Politics was not a

zero- sum game, and he got frustrated. “Politicians, at worse, are mind-
less replicas of what their constituents think. People . . . don’t want to
hear painful truths.”30
When invited to participate in the diplomatic dances that made up
Washington politics, he stepped on toes, and seldom refrained from
voicing his opinions. Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker
was once introduced to Dennis. He told Dennis that he d idn’t “like
those casinos you have out there in Chicago.”31
Dennis was well aware that he was being indulged because he was
rich and would be listened to only if he had something signifi cant to
say. Soon after he founded his new 1982 think tank, the Roosevelt
Center for American Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., it began to
fl ounder.
Washington was a tough market no matter how many millions you
had. And now Democrats were frustrating him, too. He said, “My
principal irritation with liberals in general: they d on’t understand how
it can possibly be true that you make the poor richer by making every-
one richer. I don’t understand that they d on’t even consider that pos-
sibility.”32
The problem in a political world was that Dennis couldn’t work the
floors of Congress the way he had the Chicago trading floors. It was one
thing to own one of the six original copies of the U.S. Constitution
(which he did) and an entirely different thing to try to infl uence mod-
ern political leaders. He was impatient.
Ultimately, over time he would become a board member of the
libertarian Cato Institute, serving with such notable peers as John C.
Malone, chairman, Liberty Media Corporation, and Frederick W.
Smith, chairman and CEO, FedEx Corporation. He also joined the
board of the Reason Foundation, another libertarian think tank.
Dennis’s political forays were never easy. One political critic of his
thought Dennis was a bully because he didn’t adjust his thinking to
accommodate others.33 Dennis saw that criticism as coming from a
typical Washington careerist being afraid to rock the boat.
His stance on the decriminalization of narcotics best illustrated
what made him tick. He knew the “drug czar” of the day, Bill Bennett,
would never defeat drug violence with his “just say no” approach.

Dennis thought people should be allowed to do what they wanted to
do, even if they injured themselves, as long as they did not hurt others.
He commented:
The drug war violates the Golden Rule of doing unto others as
you would have them do unto you. None of us is free of vice or
temptation. Does any one of us really want to be jailed for our
moral shortcomings? If our teenaged child is arrested for drug
possession—a distinct possibility, since 54 percent of teenagers
admit trying illicit drugs—do we really want him or her sent to
prison for falling victim to the curiosity of youth?34
Here was a man making millions in the pits by winning as much
money from others as possible, but at the same he was clearly worried
about others well being. He was a mass of contradictions.
Rough Seas
Dennis had some severe down periods before that banner year of
1986. Perhaps his political ambitions had caused a loss of focus. Add-
ing to his responsibility, by this time he had moved beyond trad-
ing only his own money. He was trading for others, and managing
their money was not his strongest suit. He said, “It’s drastically more
work to lose other people’s money. It’s tough. I go home and worry
about it.”35
This was not what his clients wanted to hear. In 1983, when his as-
sets under management peaked at over $25 million, his accounts for
clients hit turbulence. After a 53 percent rise in January, accounts
dropped 33 percent in February and March. That drop was enough to
prompt George Soros to yank the $2 million he had invested with Den-
nis only two months earlier. After a partial rebound in April and May,
Dennis’s funds dived another 50 percent in value. His 1983-era com-
puter that cost $150,000 did little to console nervous clients.
It took many of his investors more than two years to get back to
even with their investment. Most d idn’t stick around, and Dennis
closed down some accounts in 1984. He rebated all management

fees to losing accounts and conceded that trading client money as
aggressively as his own money was not something clients could psy-
chologically handle.36 What did that aggression look like on a month-
by- month basis?

Dennis was famous for those big returns, and that was what his cli-
ents wanted—to become rich like Rich. They got on board knowing
full well the voyage would get rocky, but conveniently forgot that fact
when rough sailing made them seasick. At the first sign of troubled
waters, when they were puking losses, they cut short the voyage and
blamed Dennis. He was learning the hard way about people’s irrational
expectations.
In 2005, Dennis looked back on his troubled times in the fund man-
agement arena:

I think the problem is that a money manager very rarely ever sits
down with the person whose money it is. There’s always a repre-
sentative of a firm of a firm of a firm. When you have customer
money, you generally try to please the people who want “pass-
able,” whereas you might be able to explain it to the ultimate end
user whose money it is that “this might look brutal, but w e’re try-
ing for something spectacular.”37
However, at that time in 1983, Dennis needed a way out of the cus-
tomer rat race. He wanted to divert even more attention to big-p icture
strategies, from philosophizing to an even greater focus on decriminal-
ization of pot to anything but being beholden to impatient and unin-
formed clients.
In many ways his Turtle teaching experiment was his second act,
and he knew it. He said, “You shouldn’t, I suppose, live in your trading
children’s reflective glory, but I am. I think [training the Turtles] is the
single best thing I’ve done in commodities.”38 Yet there was no way he
could have known at the time that the single best thing he would do
would change his life and the history of speculative trading in ways
never imagined.
Glory and legend aside, in 1983, with a clear plate, Dennis’s most
immediate task was to select his Turtle students from the thousands
who responded to his want ad.

The Turtles
“How much of a role does luck play in trading? In the long run,
zero. Absolutely zero. I d on’t think anybody winds up make
money in this business because they started out lucky.”
Richard Dennis
Over the years, almost every time the subject of Dennis’s training ex-
periment (starting in winter 1983) comes up, those people who have
heard of it invariably compare it to the spring 1983 classic movie Trad-
ing Places, staring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. Millions have
seen the movie over the last twenty years, either in the theater or on
television.
The idea for the movie appears to have sprung from Mark Twain’s
1893 short story “The £1,000,000 Bank Note.” Twain’s famous story
speculated on what would happen if a perfectly honest American
visitor was turned loose in London with nothing but a million- pound
bank note in his pocket and no explanation of how it got there.
In Trading Places, ultra- rich commodity brokers, brothers Mor-
timer and Randolph Duke, make a bet that they can turn a blue
blood (Aykroyd, as Louis Winthorpe III) to crime and turn a street
hustler (Murphy, as Billy Ray Valentine) into a successful trader. In
the movie Mortimer, arguing against Hume and Locke, exclaims,
“With his genes, you could put Winthorpe anywhere and he’s going
to come out on top. Breeding . . . same as in race horses. It’s in the
blood.”1
When I was trying to nail down with 100 percent certainty that the
screenplay came before Dennis’s Turtle training experiment, the fi lm’s
screenwriter, Herschel Weingrod, shed some light. He flatly said that
he had never heard of Richard Dennis when his script was completed
in October 1982. He was researching and writing a script in the early

1980s about Chicago trading and didn’t immediately hear of Richard
Dennis? That seemed implausible.
Yet it’s very plausible to assume the movie’s basic premise had an
influence on Dennis’s experiment. I wasn’t alone in that view. Mike
Carr, one of Dennis’s students, often received the same reaction when
the subject of the experiment came up: “Whenever you describe the
program to anybody, they say, ‘Oh it’s like Trading Places,’ and of
course, that’s a logical parallel. I think you’d have to ask Rich and Bill,
but I never viewed it as anything other than coincidental.”
It is easy to see why Carr would say that; Dennis was an empiricist
before the movie was on the drawing board. But at a bare minimum the
movie must have been a catalyst, the trigger for him to take action.
When he was asked whether his training experiment was inspired by
Trading Places, Dennis denied it: “Oh God, no! Actually I think the
movie came after. I certainly hope t hat’s true! I did like that movie
more than I wanted to. We did [the experiment] because everyone be-
lieved in intuition including Bill who is a very logical guy. And I
thought about intuition and about trading and it didn’t seem right.”2
A third student of Dennis’s Mike Shannon, with respect for Dennis
in his voice, disagreed wholeheartedly with Carr: “Let me put it this
way, and bluntly, you bet your ass it had a freaking role in [the experi-
ment]. It absolutely did. Whether he denies it or not, of course it did.”
Despite Dennis’s denial, the parallels seem to be too close to be co-
incidental. Dennis was watching Randolph and Mortimer play out his
debate on the big screen. Randolph was convinced Eddie M urphy’s
character was the product of a poor environment; Mortimer thought
that view was babble.
Unlike the movie, the exact nature of Dennis and Eckhardt’s wager,
if any existed, is not known. However, the movie Trading Places did
gross over $100 million before the training experiment was even on the
drawing board.
Dennis was about to become the new Willy Wonka. He was about to
let people into his “factory,” C&D Commodities, just like Wonka let
kids into his chocolate factory. There were risks for him. His students
might let him down or, worse, steal his secrets. He was undeterred:
“Some people tell you ‘no,’ but I think it [trading] is transferable. It
seemed to me so clear that it is transferable, that there are no mysteries.

If it isn’t a mystery, then I ought to be able to get people to do that. I
don’t want to spend so much time working anymore and also I want to
prove to people that there’s no great mystery to it.”3
Life Is Random . . . Sometimes
People were willing to do just about anything to get Dennis’s attention.
Of all the approaches his students took to get themselves admitted to
his trading school, Jim Melnick’s was the most extreme and inventive.
He was an overweight, working- class guy from Boston who was living
over a saloon in the Chicago suburbs. However, Melnick was deter-
mined to get as close to Dennis as possible. He actually moved to Chi-
cago just because he’d heard about Richard Dennis. He ended up as a
security guard for the Chicago Board of Trade and every morning
would say, “Good morning, Mr. Dennis” as Dennis entered the build-
ing. Then, boom, the ad came out and Melnick got selected.
Dennis, who was loaded with millions and power, took a guy off the
street and gave him the opportunity to start a new life. The story of
Melnick is pure rags-t o-r iches. How did he know that getting that close
to Dennis could lead to something? He didn’t, of course, but he hoped
it would. His self- confidence was prophetic.
Another of Dennis’s students described Jim’s “everyman” qualities:
“He reminded me of a truck driver and like magic became a ‘Turtle’
and he still couldn’t believe why or how . . . as far as where he is today,
I have no clue at all.”
Mike Shannon, a former actor who had left school at the age of six-
teen, made it to Dennis’s door, too. He recalled, “I was working as a
broker, and I was a very bad commodity broker.” Through a bunch of
floor brokers Shannon found out about the ad, but he knew his résumé
was problematic. He had a solution to that: “I made up a phony re-
sume, and I sent it off to Richard Dennis. I used the school of audacity
to get the job.” People get fired or, at the very least, don’t get hired be-
cause of falsifying a résumé, but that was not how it worked with the
eccentric head of C&D Commodities.
On the other hand, Jim DiMaria, a Notre Dame graduate and fam-
ily man straight from the Ozzie and Harriet back lot, was already
on the trading floor working for Dennis when he applied. DiMaria

remembered that every now and again there would be a “1,000 lot”
(jargon for a huge order of one thousand futures contracts) that would
come through on the trading floor. Finally, he said, “Who is this client
with the enormous orders?” He thought he’d heard it was a rich
dentist, which was plausible since doctors often dabbled in trading.
Eventually he put two and two together, realizing that Rich Dennis
was the “rich dentist.”
Dennis, however, was not looking solely for doormen and fl oor trad-
ers. He went after the highly educated, too. Michael Cavallo had a
Harvard MBA. With a mop of brown hair and wire- rimmed glasses, he
was a preppy corporate warrior working in Boston when he caught
wind of the ad that would change his life.
When he saw the ad, Cavallo had already heard of Dennis. He re-
called, “I nearly fell out of my seat when I saw it. He was looking for
starting shortstop. I c ouldn’t believe it. This is sort of a dream job for
me. I immediately responded.”
There was plenty of serendipity as other potential students learned
of the experiment. Former U.S. Air Force pilot Erle K eefer’s path
to Dennis was pure coincidence as well. He was sitting in a New
York City sauna when he picked up a newspaper and spotted the Den-
nis ad.
At that moment the female star of the movie Trading Places, Jamie
Lee Curtis, was sitting in the same sauna with her boyfriend. Keefer
was sitting there reading Barron’s. “I am looking at this ad and I knew
who Rich was. I said, ‘Wow! This guy did it.’ ” Keefer thought there was
little chance he would get accepted.
In the strictly man’s world of commodities trading in the early 1980s,
women did apply. Liz Cheval, the diminutive and fl amboyant Katie
Couric look- alike, was one of them. She must have known that
she would stand out from other applicants by being female. At the time
she was actively considering a career in filmmaking, even though she
was working for a brokerage firm as a day job.4
Cheval’s former boss, Bradley Rotter, knew the offer was a big deal:
“Dennis had already been managing money for me, and I did very
well. Liz came to me and said she was thinking about applying and
asked whether or not she should do it and I said absolutely. It was an
opportunity of a lifetime.”

Jeff Gordon, an attorney and small business owner at the time, just
happened to be thumbing through the newspaper and saw the ad. Gor-
don, five foot eight, a slender man who could have been a former
member of the Revenge of the Nerds cast, knew the opportunity could
be huge: “Everybody wanted to be able to trade, to make money like
Richard Dennis.” Firing off a résumé was a coincidental and fortuitous
life- changing decision that Gordon made in a heartbeat.
Given Dennis’s eccentric personality, it was no shock that Jiri
“George” Svoboda, an immigrant from then communist Czechoslova-
kia and a monster underdog in most people’s eyes, was selected. He
was a master blackjack player beating Las Vegas like a drum long be-
fore Breaking Vegas and 1990’s famed M.I.T. blackjack team.
Dennis also selected Tom Shanks. Handsome, dark- haired, and
smooth with the ladies, Shanks was working as a computer program-
mer for Hull Trading as his day job and beating Vegas at night with his
blackjack skills.
Shanks and Svoboda knew each other from the blackjack under-
ground. When they bumped into each other in Chicago, Svoboda said
to Shanks, “Hey, I’m here for an interview with Richard Dennis. Have
you heard?” Shanks had no clue, but said, “You’ve got to get me an
interview!” They both ended up getting hired that same afternoon.
Erle Keefer knew about their wild backgrounds. He said, “George
ran the Czech team, and Tom was essentially with the Dingo com-
puter in a boot.” Shanks used to say, “I never want to see another Dingo
boot in my life.” He had to learn how to take it apart to put the com-
puter in and was mighty sick of boots after a while. Other inventions
allowed Shanks to be almost dead accurate as to the sequence of cards
as they were dealt.
How could Dennis not hire a guy who had put a computer in a boot
during the 1970s? That effort just screamed, “Do anything to win.”
Mike Carr, on the other hand, had built a name for himself at the
role- playing game firm Dungeons and Dragons, where he developed a
cult following with his “wargaming” authorship. He had also devel-
oped a board game, “Fight In The Skies,” which modeled World War
I–style air combat. He just happened to pick up the Wall Street Journal
for the first time in six months and saw the ad. He called it “Divine
Providence.”

Jerry Parker, who would make the cut, knew the potential life-
changing ramifications of being selected. The unassuming accountant
and evangelical Christian, with a proper side part to his hair, was not
headed down the trading path prior to seeing the C&D ad. He said, “I
was a small town person [from Lynchburg, Virginia] and Richard Den-
nis rescued me from leading a normal life.”5
Before any of the average- Joe pupils were officially “rescued,” as
Parker had so aptly phrased it, they had to continue through the selec-
tion process. After sending in their résumés, applicants who made the
first cut received a letter and a test.
The letter was formal and utilitarian. It reflected none of that Den-
nis “energy and spirit.” In by-t he-b ook attorney-s peak, it said if selected,
Turtles would get 15 percent of the profits as salary after they com-
pleted a short training period and then a short trial trading period.
All potential students were told that they would have to relocate to
Chicago. Prospective students at this stage of the process were asked
for their college entrance exam scores. If they didn’t have those, they
needed to explain why.
There was more. Candidates had to complete a 63-question true–
false test. The true–false questions all appeared to be easy at fi rst glance,
but perhaps tricky on second thought. A cross- section of true-false ques-
tions included:
1. Trade long or short, but not both.
2. Trade the same number of contracts in all markets.
3. If you have $100,000 to risk, you should risk $25,000 on every
trade.
4. When you enter, you should know where to exit if a loss occurs.
5. You can never go broke taking profi ts.
6. The majority of traders are always wrong.
7. Average profits should be about 3 or 4 times average losses.
8. A trader should be willing to let profits turn into losses.
9. A very high percentage of trades should be profi ts.

10. Needing and wanting money are good motivators to good
trading.
11. One’s natural inclinations are good guides to decision making
in trading.
12. Luck is an ingredient in successful trading over the long run.
13. It’s good to follow hunches in trading.
14. Trends are not likely to persist.
15. It’s good to average down when buying.
16. A trader learns more from his losses than his profi ts.
17. Others’ opinions of the market are good to follow.
18. Buying dips and selling rallies is a good strategy.
19. It’s important to take a profit most of the time.
Just as on college entrance exams, there were also essay questions to
answer. On the back of the true–false answer sheet, prospective stu-
dents had to answer these essay questions with one sentence:
1. Name a book or movie you like and why.
2. Name a historical figure you like and why.
3. Why would you like to succeed at this job?
4. Name a risky thing you have done and why.
5. Is there anything else you’d like to add?
Dennis also listed essay questions that asked what good or bad quali-
ties students might have and whether those would help or hurt in trad-
ing. In addition, he wanted to know whether prospective students
would rather be good or lucky. There was seemingly no primer to an-
swer these questions!
The answers to the fourth essay question ranged from a prospective
student who drove an hour to a basketball game without having a ticket



==================================================
                     PAGE 52

to someone who drove around Saudi Arabia for several months with
whiskey in his car trunk—not exactly something you should do in that
part of the world. The person without the basketball ticket was hired,
but the person who took a risk for the sake of risk- taking was not.6
Dale Dellutri, who was Dennis’s programmer at C&D and ended
up as the day- to- day manager of the students, said the hiring strategy
had a “wing- it mentality,” adding, “We were looking for smarts and for
people who had odd ideas. There was some experimental part to it.”7
Dennis, however, was clear about what he was looking for. He
wanted people who had high math aptitude and high ACT (American
College Testing) scores. He wanted people with some interest in com-
puters or market methods. Those who worked to systematize things
had an advantage. Dennis added, “The majority of people we wound
up hiring had some interest in games. They were chess players or
backgammon players, enough so that they would even mention it on
a resume.”8
Math ability was not the sole determinant for hiring by any stretch.
Dennis and Eckhardt knew long- term trading success did not correlate
one-t o-o ne with high IQs. They were trying to assess the applicants’
ability to think in terms of odds—the same kind of thinking needed to
win at blackjack in Las Vegas. And they wanted applicants with the
emotional and psychological makeup to treat money abstractly so they
could focus on how to use it as a tool to make tons more.
More than anything, Dennis was interested in choosing people who
could subsume their egos. None of the chosen few ever would have
wanted to be on the cover of Time magazine (at least, that is, when they
were chosen). He ultimately chose people who he thought had the
ability to accept learning. While they were with Dennis, they had to be
tabulae rasae—blank slates.
It is worth repeating: The selected students were a seriously eclectic
bunch. The group was as culturally, sociologically, sexually, and po-
litically diverse as you could assemble. Walt Disney and his famed
“It’s a Small World” would have been proud of D ennis’s open- arms
approach.

The Interview of Your Life
Those candidates who passed the test were then asked to interview in
person at C&D Commodities’ offices during the Chicago winter. The
process was the same across the board. Dale Dellutri escorted them in
and out of the room, and both Dennis and Eckhardt interviewed every-
one. Interviewees were struck by how informal and, in most cases,
friendly their interviewers were.
Mike Shannon, the candidate with the padded résumé, did some
serious research in advance of his interview. He went down to the Chi-
cago Tribune basement to learn everything he could about Dennis. He
later discovered, “Over 90 percent of the answers to the questions on
the test were in those articles.” Shannon had even researched what
Dennis liked to wear: “I knew that he didn’t like to wear shoes. He
hated suits and all that. I just wore a beat-u p old sport coat, pair of
jeans, and pair of topsiders with no socks.”
It turns out Dennis and Shannon had one thing in common: They
both grew up playing the board game Risk. Shannon said, “I knew he
played when he was a teenager. I think that kind of helped and that
definitely broke the ice.”
For those unfamiliar with Risk, it is a game of world domination,
where the object is to conquer the world. To win, you must attack
and defend—attacking to acquire territory, and defending to keep it
from your opponents. Dennis may have been quirky, but he lived to
win. That was exactly what playing Risk meant: Beat the other guy
and win.
Paul Rabar, another student candidate, just happened to have been
the most experienced trader of all student hires. Rabar had dropped out
of UCLA Medical School. Before that, he was a classically trained pia-
nist. However, before being hired by Richard Dennis, he was trained
and mentored by Chuck Le Beau. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Le
Beau was a regional director for the E. F. Hutton & Co. brokerage on
the West Coast. It was there that he taught Rabar.
In one of those small- world stories, their E. F. Hutton offi ce ended
up handling some brokerage for the infamous Billionaire Boys Club
(BBC) during the early 1980s. The BBC was started by Joe Gamsky
(who later renamed himself Joe Hunt, and became the focus of several

TV movies). Gamsky was trading serious-s ized money across the Chi-
cago Mercantile Exchange from 1980 to 1984, making a big name for
himself. Before he was exposed as a con, Gamsky was getting Dennis-
like attention on the Chicago trading floors and in the press. He, too,
was called a boy wonder.
Le Beau and Rabar, however, did nothing wrong. They were simply
brokers placing trades for an assortment of clients. Still, was it possible
that Dennis was interested in going through the interview process with
Rabar just to see what he may or may not have known about G amsky’s
trading? T hat’s the kind of opposition research of which Dennis was
certainly capable.
Rabar’s interview did evolve into a discussion of the finer points of
trading. At one point Dennis asked a trick question: “What if you get
bounced out of the same ‘long’ trade five times in a row?” Rabar was
cocksure: “If it goes up again, I will buy it again.” Rabar’s knowledge
had a lot to do with his hiring, but he was the exception. Dennis d idn’t
want a room full of Rabars.
Erle Keefer, on the other hand, started talking about British empiri-
cism with Dennis. They were discussing “what is reality?” and quickly
dove into a deep debate about George Berkeley’s book Hylas and Philo-
nous. Keefer later learned that one of the things Dennis was looking for
was the ability to suspend your belief in reality.
Then, quickly, Eckhardt changed the subject from philosophy in
order to test Keefer. He asked, “Do you believe in the central limit
theorem?” Keefer replied, “I believe the central limit theorem is like a
stop clock, which is right twice a day.” He later said, “Little did I realize
the game we were going to play.”
Eckhardt was signaling that their trading strategy relied upon the
idea that if you were tossing dice, a string of 6 sixes in a row happens
more often than people know or expect. In other words, Eckhardt was
saying that they were not mean reversion traders. Mean reversion trad-
ers make bets that markets stay in tight ranges and that if they veer out
of the range, they typically revert to the average or mean. He was saying
in plain terms that markets trend, and those trends come unexpectedly.
Keefer knew it meant that they were not options traders.
Michael Cavallo had a different vantage on the interview. He said it
was the only job interview that he ever truly enjoyed. He didn’t care



==================================================
                     PAGE 55                      
==================================================

The Turtles 39
whether or not he got the job because he had “this great conversation
with people that were incredibly intelligent.” Dennis and Eckhardt
peppered Cavallo with questions. They asked him how much he knew
about markets, on a scale of a zero to one hundred. He recalled, “I
answered, ‘sixty,’ being not just an interview gamesmanship response,
just the kind of response where I thought I was at.”
Later, Dennis liked to tell the story that he had asked that question
of everybody and that Curtis Faith had replied “ninety-n ine” and Liz
Cheval had replied “one.” Dennis always fondly said, “I hired both of
them because that way I figured I had everything that you could know
about commodities.”
There was obviously no way you could second- guess what answers
Dennis was looking for. And let’s face it; The odds were stacked against
potential students if they gave pat “Harvard Business School graduate”
responses. Cavallo knew in the Fortune 500 world that people would
not get a job answering the way Faith and Cheval did. As he com-
mented, “A lot of places would say, ‘Oh well, this guy is too arrogant
and he thinks he knows more than he does and he’s headed for a fall.’
And they might say, ‘ She’s too timid.’ But in fact, certain things that
they liked most other places wouldn’t necessarily like.”
On the other hand, Mike Carr’s answer to Dennis’s question about
what person he admired the most could easily have been interpreted as
politically incorrect. Carr recalled, “I remember Rich asking me, ‘Why
Rommel?’ I was the only one who cited Field Marshal Erwin Rommel,
the famed ‘Desert Fox,’ as the person from history I most admired. De-
spite being a German general during the Second World War, he was
not a Nazi. Most telling of all, he was highly respected by military men
on both sides, as a general and as a man.”
After the interview was over, Mike Cavallo was the only Turtle to
mention that he was on to the clever ploy that the interview didn’t end
after he left the room. After the interview, Dale Dellutri took Cavallo
to the elevator and said, “Well, how did it go?” Cavallo told him how
great he thought the interview was, but he quickly realized that ques-
tion was part of the interview itself: “I said I liked Rich and Bill so
much. Whereas other people might have said, ‘Oh God, they really put
me through the ringer’ or something like that.”
The Dennis brain trust was showing their hand. You had to play

their “game.” The elevator filter must have eliminated students from
the process who otherwise would have made it. That’s brutal. Perhaps,
as they read this, former interviewees who did not make the cut will
realize that when they said something foolish to Dale Dellutri at the
elevator, it was at that point that they were eliminated from the candi-
date pool. No one ever said life was fair.
Mike Cavallo was under no false illusion and knew that obvious
candidates with his type of résumé were not what Dennis had in mind.
He was surprised that he was even in the running. At the end of the day,
Dennis and Eckhardt figured too many Cavallos and Rabars would
have too many bad habits to unlearn.
Those who think a Harvard MBA is the only ticket to business suc-
cess, wake up. Cavallo was the exception, not the rule. Dennis and
Eckhardt clearly believed that hiring all Harvard MBAs would have
been a bust.
All these potential students saw the interview process from different
vantage points. Jeff Gordon thought the selection process came down
to a “games” aptitude: “I didn’t have a résumé at the time so I wrote
him a letter that indicated that I had spent more time playing chess
than attending law school. The funny thing is my girlfriend read the
letter and said, ‘You can’t say that!’ I said, ‘No, that’s not true, Rich
Dennis is a different kind of guy, I think he’ll be looking for people who
are a little bit different.’ ”
During his interview, Gordon was logically assuming that he had a
lot to learn from Dennis and Eckhardt, but they said to him. “Well, you
might actually be disappointed.” Dennis was worth hundreds of mil-
lions at the time, yet he was self- deprecating and humble.
Mike Carr’s previous job for Dungeons and Dragons may have been
the key to convincing the C&D brain trust to hire him because both
Dale Dellutri and William Eckhardt said their sons enjoyed playing
the game and, as Carr commented, “I knew that couldn’t hurt!” That
said, Carr had no real idea of Dennis’s style of trading and fumbled
through parts of the interview. He recalled, “Richard Dennis was re-
nowned as a technical trader, but I wasn’t aware of that at the time.”
During the interview, he had asked Dennis, “Do you trade technically
or fundamentally?” Dennis replied, “We trade technically.” Carr then



==================================================
                     PAGE 57                      
==================================================

The Turtles 41
said, “Is fundamental trading dead?” Dennis sarcastically shot back,
“We hope not.”
Jim DiMaria, the relative insider already working for Dennis as a
broker, knew the importance of his hometown for his trading ambi-
tions: “It’s just part of the fiber of Chicago. If I were from Baltimore or
Los Angeles. I probably would never have done anything like this.”9
But before DiMaria was ever picked for the experiment, he knew he
ultimately wanted to be the person making the trading decisions, not
just someone else’s fl oor broker.10 He had to find a way to get there, and
Dennis’s experiment was it. DiMaria, however, was completely bam-
boozled by the selection process: “For whatever reason I was selected.
I don’t know if anyone knows why they were selected. I’ve heard that
some of the people from Rich’s entourage were selected as a control
group. Like let’s just grab this guy. Like maybe me? I don’t know.”
All the prospective students knew the chance of a lifetime was star-
ing them in the face whether or not they understood exactly what they
were getting into. For example, near the end of her interview, when she
realized she might be making a good impression, Liz Cheval’s knees
went weak: “I couldn’t have gotten through the interview, had I known
[it might work out; it was] like winning the job lottery.”11 She was con-
fident in the interview because she couldn’t believe she had gotten that
far. She knew her worst-c ase scenario if selected was that her résumé
would be enhanced by even a few weeks spent under Dennis’s tutelage.
There was nothing to lose.
All in all, the hiring process was far from headhunter precise. Den-
nis and Eckhardt had no formal training in job recruitment or in devel-
oping questionnaires designed to select those people most able and
ready to learn. It was one thing for them to trade and make fortunes,
but it was a very different thing to execute a “nature versus nurture”
experiment with live human beings.
The Turtle Contract
Once accepted into Dennis’s program, Turtles had to adhere to a strict
confidentiality agreement. It was titled “Synopsis of Contract for Trad-
ing Advisor Trainees” and said in part that each participant would have



==================================================
                     PAGE 58                      
==================================================

42 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
a five-y ear contract, which could be terminated without notice by Den-
nis at any time. There was no assurance of staying in the program, but
the agreement did clearly state students would not be held accountable
for losses that they might generate trading Dennis’s money: “The
trainee will not be obligated to repay advances, which are not covered
by earned performance fees, nor will the trainee be liable for losses due
to adverse trading performance.” And for those students thinking ahead
about how to get-r ich-q uick now that they had D ennis’s “secrets,” the
agreement had no flexibility. During the term of the contract they were
prohibited from trading for their own account and prohibited from
trading for anyone other than Dennis. The agreement went on to
clearly preclude competing against Dennis or disclosing any confi den-
tial or proprietary information the participants might learn. Lastly, at
the end of the agreement all students were prohibited from disclosing
Dennis’s proprietary trading methods for another fi ve years.
For those with a legal background, this agreement could have been
a deal- breaker. That said, no one declined to join the Turtle program
even though there were no real guarantees and many potential restric-
tions on their future activity. Once the agreement was signed, the Tur-
tles headed off to class.
Chicago was a different place when the Turtles entered class in Jan-
uary 1984. Harry Caray was the announcer at Wrigley Field, and Ryne
Sandberg’s rookie year was underway. The Apple Macintosh had just
been introduced, and Hulk Hogan defeated The Iron Sheik for the
World Wrestling Federation Championship. Politically, Dennis would
be very unhappy with Reagan heading toward a landslide defeat of
Mondale.
In the context of that world, the lucky few chosen to learn how to
trade for big money still had to absorb trading rules that would have
made investors like Warren Buffett cringe. There would be no buying
and holding, or buying low and selling high. What they were about to
learn was the antithesis of what was and still is taught in fi nance depart-
ments at the world’s finest universities. Run this story by a college fi -
nance professor today and take note of his reactions.

The Turtles 43
The Classroom
If Dennis had been worth only $100,000 at the time of the experiment,
would the Turtles have listened as intently? No. Dennis knew the Tur-
tles were the “dumb stumps” and that the only reason that they bought
into everything was that he had made $200 million.
If he said, “On Monday, you will buy the S&P 500 stock index when
it’s up exactly 35 ticks no matter what’, all of the Turtles would have
gone over a cliff to follow orders. One Turtle said that when a guy has
made $200 million and he says, ‘You can walk on water’, people are
going to say, ‘Okay I can walk on water.’ You have just crossed that un-
believable emotional hump that we all have in our brains.”
Crossing the “emotional hump,” whether in trading or baseball, is
reaching that point at which you are intellectually and emotionally
challenged and respond by saying, “I can do it.” Between D ennis’s
reputation and the self-c onfidence that came from being chosen from
over a thousand applicants, the Turtles crossed that hump with ease.
The bottom line was that two trading superstars had selected them as
students. Motivation was a given.
That same kind of aura surrounded Jim Leyland, manager of the
2006 pennant-w inning Detroit Tigers baseball team. This was a team
that only a few years prior had lost over a hundred games in one
year—a horrendous record. But now they had a manager, Leyland, in
whom everyone believed. There wasn’t a Detroit Tiger who d idn’t
suddenly feel like he could deliver in the clutch. “If I walk in there
tomorrow and find my name and I’m batting cleanup, I’d expect to
get a hit,” pitcher Todd Jones said. And, of course, pitchers are not
counted on to hit!
The Turtles had the same attitude. The two weeks of training con-
sisted of Dennis and Eckhardt figuratively yelling “jump” and the Tur-
tles responding, “How high?” However, years of legend-b uilding have
made the entire process of the Turtles’ training sound a great deal more
elegant and sophisticated than it really was.
They were put up in the Union League Club in downtown Chi-
cago. Mike Cavallo described it as “sort of one of those old- fashioned
fancy clubs where there were elderly people dozing under their news-
paper.”



==================================================

He was not exaggerating. Tom Willis and I tried to have lunch
there in 2006, but were asked to leave because I was wearing jeans. The
Union League Club remains an old- world bastion for those who made
their market fortunes way back when. With dark wood paneling, worn
Oriental carpets, and leather- upholstered furniture, and staffed by el-
derly union workers moving in slow motion, it is well past its prime.
Clearly, not much had changed at the club since the Turtles walked
in the door. That Richard Dennis should belong to such a club in 1983
was amusing given how anti-e stablishment he was. However, he was
simply being practical, because the club was close to the Chicago
Board of Trade and C&D Commodities’ offi ces.
The Turtles spent their two weeks of training at the Union League
Club as well. They all had to wear a jacket and tie at all times—includ-
ing Dennis. Only half of the more than two dozen students in the train-
ing room were Turtles, if you defined Turtles as those students who
would trade only Dennis’s money. It was H BO’s hit show Entourage
for sure.
Right before training began the Turtles attended a welcoming party,
since Dennis liked to throw lavish cocktail parties during the Christ-
mas holidays. The newcomers got a glimpse of what passed for Dennis’s
Chicago social scene and had the chance to meet each other. But the
party did little to assuage the jitters. The first day of training had many
feeling the stomach clutch of starting grade school all over again. They
walked into the classroom fully unnerved.
Richard Dennis, William Eckhardt, and Dale Dellutri handled the
training the same way they had managed the interview process. It turns
out that the C&D Commodities brain trust had met each other at
St. Laurence Catholic High School. As fate would have it, they became
close friends only because they were seated in alphabetical order.
On the fi rst day of Turtle class you could hear a pin drop. Palpable
excitement was in the air. The possibility of making money like Dennis
had everyone jacked. The first hours consisted of Dellutri discussing
how things would work procedurally and laying out “housekeeping”
matters for people who had never traded.
Dellutri was assigned the role of Turtle “team mom.” He encour-
aged the Turtles to ask questions during class, but few did at the outset.
To everyone’s disappointment, Dennis was not there during that fi rst

class. Instead, it was Eckhardt who launched into the challenge of
“managing risk” as the fi rst topic.
Managing risk was not what new traders would assume as a logical
starting point. That Eckhardt would choose to begin with risk manage-
ment was the first indication that the Turtles were starting an uncon-
ventional journey. Instead of introducing the course with a lecture on
making money, he was laying the foundation for what the students had
to do when they lost money.
Another C&D colleague, Robert Moss, was brought in on several
occasions to discuss order execution. He wanted the class to under-
stand what really was going on in the pit when their orders went in. “I
think Bill and Rich wanted them to have a pretty good understanding
given that some of them had never really been involved in the industry
before,” he said.
Once the students were past the initial jitters there was some give
and take, with questions and discussion. However, the class was primar-
ily a lecture with note- taking. The Turtles with experience quickly real-
ized that Dennis and Eckhardt knew far more than they did. Mike
Cavallo said, “A lot of the stuff that they were talking about I knew, but
I had no idea they weighted some stuff at so much more importance.”
Contrary to popular belief among those familiar with the Turtle ex-
periment, Dennis’s absence that first day of class was not an aberration.
William Eckhardt taught the Turtles a great deal of what they learned
during those two weeks in the classroom (there was only one week of
training the second year).
The irony is that while it was Eckhardt who bet against people being
able to learn how to trade, in the classroom he taught much of “the
meat and potatoes.” It was Dennis who added a succession of trading
war stories and anecdotes.
To those who saw them up close, Dennis had the capacity to make
an observation in an instant that would take someone else weeks of
painstaking math to figure out. Even Eckhardt marveled as Dennis’s
knack to intuitively see “it”: “Look what this means. Look at the deep
axiom in here. It works.” That said, Eckhardt was the mathematical
genius. He was the master of probability. Combining their observations
was the magical mixture.
Mike Shannon saw the importance of their symbiotic relationship:

==================================================

“In fact, a lot of the system development wasn’t Richard Dennis. It was
indeed Bill Eckhardt. They both hatched it up between them and
they’re both certainly responsible for it.”
To many it seemed Eckhardt was along for the ride, appreciating the
Turtle experiment from a psychological point of view, but he defi nitely
wanted his credit for the Turtles after it was over. Today, his regulatory
disclosures emphasize that he “co- developed” the systems “co- taught”
to the Turtles. Without Eckhardt, there would have been no Turtles.
Mike Cavallo thought there was a more important, though subtle,
aspect in their collaboration: “Bill did a lot of the real mathematical
work on developing the systems. I think he didn’t have R ich’s trading
genius, which is why I think in their discussion, he thought the trading
genius was the main part whereas Rich thought the system was the
main part.”
To this day, Eckhardt has had a terrific trading career. He has argu-
ably achieved much greater wealth over the long term than Dennis.
His hedge fund is now near $800 million USD. Yet when Eckhardt and
Dennis first started working together, Dennis was the one who had
made the fortune trading and Eckhardt was the original Turtle learning
from him.
It was clear to Mike Shannon that Dennis had a massive head start
over Eckhardt in terms of wealth and trading experience. He said, “Bill
was more inclined at the time to intellectually pursue the concept of
trading more so than he was in it for serious financial gain.” Over time,
Eckhardt realized that he had to strike a balance between the business
end and the actual trading. Shannon added, “I think Bill probably is
worth more, but once you get over being worth a quarter of a billion
dollars . . .”
Eckhardt always good- naturedly admitted that he had lost the nur-
ture- versus- nature battle, in which he had taken the point of view that
their systems could not be taught to kids off the street: “I assumed that
a trader added something that couldn’t be encapsulated in a mechani-
cal program. I was proven wrong. By and large, [the Turtles] learned to
trade exceedingly well. The answer to the question of whether trading
can be taught has to be an unqualifi ed yes.”12 He also scoffed at the
argument that the Turtles’ success was based on sheer luck: “The prob-

ability of experiencing the kind of success that we have had and con-
tinue to have by chance alone has to be near zero. The systems worked
for us year after year. We taught some of these systems to others, and it
worked for them. They then managed other people’s money, and
it worked again.” He acknowledged the possibility that their achieve-
ment could have been the result of luck, but he saw the probability of
that being infi nitesimally small.13
Nor did Eckhardt buy into the infinite monkey theorem that says out
of the millions of monkeys in the world, one, simply by randomly hit-
ting the keyboard, would eventually produce the collected works of
Shakespeare. To this day, many regularly push the notion that successes
such as Eckhardt and the Turtles were simply the lucky survivors from
the whole monkey population.
Some critics have attempted to explain away the Turtles as a careful
selection of very smart students. Michael Cavallo, after all, could play
five people at once at chess while blindfolded and beat them fast. He
exemplified the fact that brainpower w asn’t lacking in the C&D offi ce.
Eckhardt disagreed, saying that he had not seen much correlation be-
tween good trading and intelligence:
Some outstanding traders are quite intelligent, but a few aren’t.
Many outstandingly intelligent people are horrible traders. Aver-
age intelligence is enough. Beyond that, emotional makeup is
more important. This is not rocket science. However, it’s much
easier to learn what you should do in trading than to do it.14
Eckhardt was saying that, as with anything in life, most people know
what the right thing to do is but fail to do it. Trading is no different.
Dennis’s partner and right- hand man personally learned how hard it
was to do the right thing as an early acolyte of Dennis—just like the
many other young traders in Chicago during the 1970s. His galvaniz-
ing experience with Dennis was on the morning of November 1, 1978.
President Carter was trying to halt a sinking U.S. dollar. It was a lesson
in “emotional fortitude” forever etched in Eckhardt’s memory.
There was a rate hike and intervention in the currency markets—not
good news for Dennis and Eckhardt, who held large long positions in

gold, foreign currencies, and the grains. The markets collapsed on the
open. Gold opened below the $10-an- ounce trading limit, so they could
not exit. Silver, though down sharply, was still trading. The Comex in
New York told them they could still trade it. So they started selling sil-
ver “short,” aiming to profit as it decreased in order to protect them-
selves against further losses from the gold. But they were also concerned
that silver might rally. Decisions had to be made, and fast. There was a
lot at stake.15
Dennis asked Eckhardt calmly, “What should we do?” Eckhardt
panicked and froze at the controls. Dennis shorted silver and seconds
later it was limit down, too (a big winner). Eckhardt enthused, “In my
book that was Rich’s best trade ever because he did it under maximum
duress. If he hadn’t done it, we both would have been bankrupted by
the subsequent slide in gold.”16
One Turtle gushed in awe that Dennis still had the “balls” to execute
that trade “when they were dumb, deaf, and broke”: “They were going
the wrong way and for Dennis to just totally cover and totally reverse
was amazing. He was one of the few people who could pull the trigger
on big numbers and pull the trigger intelligently. There are some peo-
ple that just go nuts and they melt down. Especially when they’re on
the wrong side of the trade and it’s going to send them to the poor
house.”
Many people can trade small amounts day in and day out and not
worry about losing money. But as the size of their trading is increased,
say by 100 percent, their trading decisions become more signifi cant
and problematic. They begin to think about how much t hey’re win-
ning or losing, and it becomes harder to keep a level head about trad-
ing “big.” Emotions rise to the surface, and objectivity becomes harder
and harder to maintain. Disassociating the dollars from the trading was
a huge part of what was instilled in the Turtles.
Robert Moss saw the qualities in Dennis that allowed that silver
trade to happen: “There are some people who can trade one lot or two
lots or a five lot and handle that position and perform not thinking
about the money.” Moss had never seen anybody better. Tom R. Wil-
lis, the son of Tom Willis and close enough to Dennis to consider him
an uncle, said that Dennis simply had a sense of proportion that
was different from the rest of the world’s: “When he perceived that

he had an edge, he would go all into a position with mammoth trad-
ing size.”
Dennis may have been able to pull the trigger, but that disastrous
first year came close to wiping him out. He lost $2 million that fi rst day
of November. It was touch- and- go for a while. The experience forced
Dennis and Eckhardt to reevaluate everything they had learned about
trading. They began to test by computer “every idea or piece of conven-
tional wisdom that had ever passed their way. The successful trader
is the one who codifies, the one who turns things into rules. Every idea
that’s market- worthy must then be tested.”17
Don’t discount this story by saying, “It was $2 million; this is a game
for rich people, not me!” That is the dead wrong view. There will al-
ways be someone with more or less money than someone else. If you
have $100 million and you lose $2 million, that is not a big deal. If you
have $50,000 and you lose $1,000, that is not a big deal. Both losses are
2 percent.
That is not to say losses are easy to accept, but Dennis and Eckhardt
taught the Turtles not to consider their trading in terms of amounts of
money. They wanted them to think of money as a variable, because in
that way, regardless of account size, they could make the correct trad-
ing decisions at all times.
However, first and foremost Dennis and Eckhardt wanted the Tur-
tles to understand that their kind of speculation had virtually no exter-
nal limits. It took place in a limitless environment. They could bet any
amount on any potential market movement at any time, but if the Tur-
tles entered this no- limit environment and didn’t protect their scarce
capital, then sooner or later the probabilities would catch up with
them.18
The lessons they put forward in the classroom solved the dilemma of
“speculation.” Since the markets are a zero- sum game, the Turtles
learned that even a marginally profitable trader must win money from
other market players. By definition, they must use different methods
than everyone else in the game.19
What this means is that only when “good” trades, not necessarily
profitable trades, are consistently made over the long run, the chances
of profitable results increase dramatically. A bad month, a bad quarter,
or even a bad year does not mean much in the grand scheme. The

Turtles learned that the most important thing was to have a sound trad-
ing approach tested in the real world.20
Dennis and Eckhardt had that real world of making money fi gured
out. Their philosophy and rules taught in the Turtle classroom were
the equivalent of a two-w eek seminar on how to fly a plane without ever
getting in the plane.21

The Philosophy
“. . . when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth.”
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes)
Dennis and Eckhardt’s two weeks of training was heavy with the scien-
tific method—the structural foundation of their trading style and the
foundation on which they had based their arguments in high school. It
was the same foundation relied upon by Hume and Locke.
Simply put, the scientific method is a set of techniques for investi-
gating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for cor-
recting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable,
empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning.1 It
involves seven steps:
1. Define the question.
2. Gather information and resources.
3. Form hypothesis.
4. Perform experiment and collect data.
5. Analyze data.
6. Interpret data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting
point for new hypotheses.
7. Publish results.2
This is not the type of discussion you will hear on CNBC or have
with your local broker when he calls with the daily hot tip. Such
pragmatic thinking lacks the sizzle and punch of get-r ich-quick advice.

==================================================

Dennis and Eckhardt were adamant that their students consider them-
selves scientists fi rst and traders second—a testament to their belief in
doing the “right thing.”
The empiricist Dennis knew that plugging along without a solid
philosophical foundation was perilous. He never wanted his research
to be just numbers bouncing around in a computer. There had to be
a theory, and then the numbers could be used to confirm it. He said, “I
think you need the conceptual apparatus to be the first thing you start
with and the last thing you look at.”3
This thinking put Dennis was way ahead of his time. Years later,
the academic Daniel Kahneman would win a Nobel prize for “pros-
pect theory” (behavioral finance), a fancy name for what Dennis was
actually doing for a living and teaching his Turtles. Avoiding the psy-
chological voltage that routinely sank so many other traders was man-
datory for the Turtles.
The techniques that Dennis and Eckhardt taught the Turtles were
different from D ennis’s seasonal spread techniques from his early fl oor
days. The Turtles were trained to be trend-f ollowing traders. In a nut-
shell, that meant that they needed a “trend” to make money. Trend
followers always wait for a market to move; then they follow it. Captur-
ing the majority of a trend, up or down, for profit is the goal.4
The Turtles were trained this way because by 1983, Dennis knew
the things that worked best were “rules”: “The majority of the other
things that didn’t work were judgments. It seemed that the better part
of the whole thing was rules. You c an’t wake up in the morning and
say, ‘I want to have an intuition about a market.’ Y ou’re going to have
way too many judgments.”5
While Dennis knew exactly where the sweet spot was for making
big money, he often fumbled his own trading with too many discre-
tionary judgments. Looking back, he blamed his pit experience, say-
ing, “People trading in the pit are very bad systems traders generally.
They learn different things. They react to the [price] ‘tick’ in your
face.”6
Dennis and Eckhardt did not invent trend following. From the 1950s
into the 1970s, there was one preeminent trend trader with years
of positive performance: Richard Donchian. Donchian was the undis-

==================================================

53
puted father of trend following. He spoke and wrote profusely on the
subject. He influenced Dennis and Eckhardt, and just about every
other technically minded trader with a pulse.
One of Donchian’s students, Barbara Dixon, described trend follow-
ers as making no attempt to forecast the extent of a price move. The
trend follower “disciplines his thoughts into a strict set of conditions
for entering and exiting the market and acts on those rules or his
system to the exclusion of all other market factors. This removes,
hopefully, emotional judgmental influences from individual market
decisions.”7
Trend traders don’t expect to be right every time. In fact, on in-
dividual trades they admit when they are wrong, take their losses,
and move on. However, they do expect to make money over the long
run.8 In 1960, Donchian reduced this philosophy to what he called
his “weekly trading rule.” The rule was brutally utilitarian: “When
the prices moves above the high of two previous calendar weeks
(the optimum number of weeks varies by commodity), cover your
short positions and buy. When the price breaks below the low of the
two previous calendar weeks, liquidate your long position and sell
short.”9
Richard Dennis’s protégé Tom Willis had learned long ago from
Dennis why price, the philosophical underpinning of Donchian’s rule,
was the only true metric to trust. He said, “Everything known is re-
flected in the price. I could never hope to compete with Cargill [today
the world’s second-l argest private corporation, with $70 billion in rev-
enues for 2005], who has soybean agents scouring the globe knowing
everything there is to know about soybeans and funneling the infor-
mation up to their trading headquarters.” Willis has had friends
who made millions trading fundamentally, but they could never know
as much as the big corporations with thousands of employees. And
they always limited themselves to trading only one market. Willis
added, “They don’t know anything about bonds. They d on’t know
anything about the currencies. I d on’t either, but I’ve made a lot of
money trading them. They’re just numbers. Corn is a little different
than bonds, but not different enough that I’d have to trade them dif-
ferently. Some of these guys I read about have a different system for

54
each [market]. That’s absurd. We’re trading mob psychology. We’re
not trading corn, soybeans, or S&P’s. We’re trading numbers.”10
“Trading numbers” was just another Dennis convention to reinforce
abstracting the world in order not to get emotionally distracted. Den-
nis made the Turtles understand price analysis. He did this because at
first he “thought that intelligence was reality and price the appear-
ance, but after a while I saw that price is the reality and intelligence is
the appearance.”11
He was not being purposefully oblique. Dennis’s working assump-
tion was that soybean prices reflected soybean news faster than peo-
ple could get and digest the news. Since his early twenties, he had
known that looking at the news for decision-m aking cues was the
wrong thing to do.
If acting on news, stock tips, and economic reports were the real
key to trading success, then everyone would be rich. Dennis was blunt:
“Abstractions like crop size, unemployment, and inflation are mere
metaphysics to the trader. They don’t help you predict prices, and they
may not even explain past market action.”12
The greatest trader in Chicago had been trading five years before
he ever saw a soybean. He poked fun at the notion that if “something”
was happening in the weather, his trading would somehow change: “If
it’s raining on those soybeans, all that means to me is I should bring an
umbrella.”13
Turtles may have initially heard D ennis’s explanations and assumed
he was just being cute or coy, but in reality he was telling them ex-
actly how to think. He wanted the Turtles to know in their heart of
hearts the downsides of fundamental analysis: “You d on’t get any
profit from fundamental analysis. You get profit from buying and sell-
ing. So why stick with the appearance when you can go right to the
reality of price?”14
How could the Turtles possibly know the balance sheets and as-
sorted other financial metrics of all five hundred companies in the
S&P 500 index? Or how could they know all the fundamentals about
soybeans? They couldn’t. Even if they did, that knowledge would
not have told them when to buy or sell along with how much to buy
or sell.
Dennis knew he had problems if watching TV allowed people to

predict what would happen tomorrow—or predict anything for that
matter. He said, “If the universe is structured like that, I’m in trouble.”15
Fundamental reporting from C NBC’s Maria Bartiromo would have
been called “fluff” by the C&D Commodities teaching team.
Michael Gibbons, a trend-f ollowing trader, put using “news” for
trading decisions in perspective: “I stopped looking at news as some-
thing important in 1978. A good friend of mine was employed as a re-
porter by the largest commodity news service at the time. One day his
major ‘story’ was about sugar and what it was going to do. After I read
his piece, I asked, ‘how do you know all of this?’ I will never forget his
answer; he said, ‘I made it up.’ ”
However, trading à la Dennis was not all highs. Regular small losses
were going to happen as the Turtles traded D ennis’s money. Dennis
knew the role confidence would play. He said, “I suppose I didn’t like
the idea that everyone thought I was all wrong, crazy, or going to fail,
but it didn’t make any substantial difference because I had an idea
what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do it.”16
The Turtles’ core axioms were the same ones practiced by the great
speculators from one hundred years earlier:
“Do not let emotions fluctuate with the up and down of your
capital.”
“Be consistent and even- tempered.”
“Judge yourself not by the outcome, but by your process.”
“Know what you are going to do when the market does what it is
going to do.”
“Every now and then the impossible can and will happen.”
“Know each day what your plan and your contingencies are for the
next day.”
“What can I win and what can I lose? What are probabilities of
either happening?”
However, there was precision behind the familiar- sounding euphe-
misms. From the first day of training, William Eckhardt outlined fi ve

questions that were relevant to what he called an optimal trade. The
Turtles had to be able to answer these questions at all times:
1. What is it the state of the market?
2. What is the volatility of the market?
3. What is the equity being traded?
4. What is the system or the trading orientation?
5. What is the risk aversion of the trader or client?
There was no messing around in Eckhardt’s tone, as he suggested
that these were the only things that had any importance.17
What is it the state of the market? The state of the market simply
means. “What is the price that the market is trading at?” If Microsoft is
trading at 40 a share today, then that is the state of that market.
What is the volatility of the market? Eckhardt taught the Turtles
that they had to know on a daily basis how much any market goes up
and down. If Microsoft on an average trades at 50, but typically
bounces up and down on any given day between 48 and 52, then
Turtles were taught that the volatility of that market was four. They had
their own jargon to describe daily volatilities. They would say that Mi-
crosoft had an “N” of four. More volatile markets generally carried
more risk.
What is the equity being traded? The Turtles had to know how
much money they had at all times, because every rule they would
learn adapted to their given account size at that moment.
What is the system or the trading orientation? Eckhardt in-
structed the Turtles that in advance of the market opening, they had
to have their battle plan set for buying and selling. They couldn’t say,
“Okay, I’ve got $100,000; I’m going to randomly decide to trade
$5,000 of it.” Eckhardt did not want them to wake up and say, “Do I
buy if Google hits 500 or do I sell if Google hits 500?” They were
taught precise rules that would tell them when to buy or sell any
market at any time based on the movement of the price. The Turtles
had two systems: System One (S1) and System Two (S2). These sys-

57
tems governed their entries and exits. S1 essentially said you would
buy or sell short a market if it made a new twenty-d ay high or low.
What is the risk aversion of the trader or client? Risk manage-
ment was not a concept that the Turtles grasped immediately. For ex-
ample, if they had $10,000 in their account, should they bet all
$10,000 on Google stock? No. If Google all of a sudden dropped,
they could lose all $10,000 fast. They had to bet a small amount of the
$10,000, because they didn’t know whether or not a trade was going
to go in their favor. Small betting (for example, 2 percent of $10,000
on initial bets) kept them in the game to play another day, all the while
waiting for a big trend.
Class Discussion
Day after day, Eckhardt would emphasize comparisons. Once he told
the Turtles to consider two traders who have the same equity, the
same system (or trading orientation), and the same risk aversion and
were both facing the same situation in the market. For both traders,
the optimal course of action must be the same. “Whatever is optimal
for one should be optimal for the other,” he would say.18
Now this may sound simple, but human nature causes most people,
when faced with a similar situation, to react differently. They tend to
outthink the situation, figuring there must be some unique value that
they alone can add to make it even better. Dennis and Eckhardt de-
manded that the Turtles respond the same or they were out of the
program (and they did end up cutting people).
In essence Eckhardt was saying, “You are not special. You are not
smarter than the market. So follow the rules. Whoever you are and
however much brains you have, it doesn’t make a hill of beans’ differ-
ence. Because if you’re facing the same issues and if you’ve got the
same constraints, you must follow the rules.” Eckhardt said this in a far
nicer, more professorial and academic way, but that was what he
meant. He did not want his students to wake up and say, “I’m feeling
smart today,” “I’m feeling lucky today,” or “I’m feeling dumb today.”
He taught them to wake up and say, “I’ll do what my rules say to do
today.”

Dennis was clear that it would take stick-t o-itiveness to follow the
rules day to day and do it right: “To follow the good principles and not
let fear, greed and hope interfere with your trading is tough. You’re
swimming upstream against human nature.”19 The Turtles had to have
the confi dence to follow through on all rules and pull the trigger when
they were supposed to. Hesitate and they would be toast in the zero-
sum market game.
This motley crew of novices quickly learned that of the fi ve ques-
tions deemed to be most important by Eckhardt, the first two, about
the market’s state and the market’s volatility, were the objective
pieces of the puzzle. Those were simply facts that everyone could see
plain as day.
Eckhardt was most interested in the last three questions, which ad-
dressed the equity level, the systems, and the risk aversion. They were
subjective questions all grounded in the present. It did not make a dif-
ference what the answers to these three questions were a month ago
or last week. Only “right now” was important.20
Put another way, the Turtles could control only how much money
they had now, how they decided to enter and exit a trade now, and
how much to risk on each trade right now. For example, if Google is
trading at 500 today, Google is trading at 500. That’s a statement of
fact. If Google has a precise volatility (“N”) today of four, t hat’s not a
judgment call.
To reinforce the need for objectivity on issues such as “N” Eckhardt
wanted the Turtles to think in terms of “memory- less trading.” He told
them, “You s houldn’t care about how you got to the current state but
rather about what you should do now. A trader who trades differen-
tially because of swings in confidence is focusing on his or her own
past rather than on current realities.”21
If five years ago you had $100,000 and today you have only
$50,000, you can’t sit around and make decisions based on the hypo-
thetical $100,000 you used to have. You have to base your decisions
on the reality of the $50,000 you have now.
How to handle profits properly is a separation point between
winners and losers. Great traders adjust their trading to the
money they have at any one time.

If crude oil had just traded above $40 for the first time, the Turtles
were not to sit around and kibitz about it. They were to take action if it
hit their S1 or S2 entry or exit signals. Why or how it got to $40 was ir-
relevant. Eckhardt threw out the examples fast and furious.
He started with a commonplace idea that most people are willing
to accept. If you make some profits with your original money, you can
take more risks, because now y ou’re playing with their money. He said,
“It’s certainly a comforting thought. It certainly can’t be as bad to lose
their money as yours. Can’t it? Why should it matter whom the money
used to belong to? What matters is whom it belongs to now (you) and
what to do about it now.”22
For instance, assume you start with a $100,000 account, quickly
making another $100,000. You now have $200,000. Although you
made a profit, you can’t say, “I can now take crazier risks with that
$100,000.”
Why would you view your money as funny money or lucky money?
The Turtles were taught to treat that additional $100,000 as they did
their original $100,000. They had to use the same concern, care, and
discipline. The five questions d idn’t change, even if their account bal-
ances did.
Traders who face the same opportunity must trade the same.
Personal feelings can’t interfere.
Pretend there are two traders, John and Mary. John and Mary are
exactly alike in all respects. They have the same risk aversion and the
same system. There is one small difference between the two: John has
50 percent more money. John then decides to go on vacation and
while he’s away having fun at South Beach, Mary makes 50 percent.
Now they have exactly the same amount of money. How or why they
got to the point of having the same amount of money is not relevant.
The correct course for John is the correct course for Mary.23
Eckhardt did not want the Turtles to say. “I had a period where I
made some money, so now I can do something different.” They had to
take the same steps regardless.
Logically, upon first hearing that Mary had just made 50 percent
more, most people might want to debate Eckhardt’s contention that

they should trade the same way. The rule was designed to keep trad-
ers with a big profi t run- up in their trading account from acting irratio-
nally or breaking a rule. Many people with a big profi t run- up don’t
want to lose those paper gains. They are anxious to take their profi ts
off the table so they can feel secure.
Eckhardt slammed home the point that the security craved by hu-
mans was bad for proper trading: “The distinction between open
trade equity and closed-o ut trading profits is completely vacuous.
How much do you have in open trade equity? How much do you have
in closed- out equity? This is a bookkeeper’s artifact. It has absolutely
no relevance to correct trading.”
While it might have zero relevance, people go the wrong way all
the time. Instead of trading as they should today, based on their
money now and their rules, they trade based on the money they once
had. They are clearly trying to recoup. “How much money you use to
have has no significance. It’s how much money you have now,” im-
plored Eckhardt.24
If the Turtles started with $100,000 but now had $90,000, they still
had to make trading decisions based on what they had now. If the
Turtles were supposed to risk 2 percent of their trading capital, then
they had to risk 2 percent of their current $90,000, not 2 percent of
their original $100,000.
If the Turtles lost money in a market, they had to move on.
Accepting and managing losses are part of their game.
The whole notion of holding on to the past was a big issue for the
team at C&D Commodities. Eckhardt was stern about the mistake los-
ing traders make when they look backward in time. The losing trader is
trying to make money back in the same market and on the same posi-
tion. Eckhardt described it as a “market vendetta.”
Suppose John lost money in Cisco. That market “hurt” him. Instead
of focusing on what the best opportunity might be now, he only wants
his money back in Cisco. All John can think about is his Cisco position,
and in turn his loss just keeps growing. According to Eckhardt, this is
the kind of personal memory mistake that always leads to disaster.25
The Turtles were taught not to fixate on what particular market

made money that month or year or what market lost money. They
learned to be agnostic and accept whatever trending market created
opportunity.
The same principle was seen with “losses.” For example, when the
Turtles were taught that they had to exit with a small loss, because
they don’t know how far it could drop, they got out. What they d idn’t
want to do was look at the initial small loss and say, “I had $100,000 of
Microsoft and now I have $90,000, so I’m going to put another
$10,000 of my money into MSFT because now it’s cheap.”
Dennis said that to add to a losing position was like being the kid
who’s been burned on a hot stove once already but puts his hand back
on the stove just to prove it was the stove that was wrong.26 However,
that said, if after taking a small loss the Turtles got a signal to get into
the market again, they got back in. An example using legendary
hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones best explains the point.
In one of Jones’s best trades, he got an entry signal. He got in. The
trade went against him and he lost 2 percent, forcing him to get out.
All of a sudden, the entry signal came right back as the market moved
in his favor again. He could not debate it. He had to get back in. Then
it went against him again for another 2 percent loss, forcing him to get
out again. He went through this process ten or so times in a row until
he got a position that actually kept trending. That final big trend made
enough money to pay for all those false starts and then some, but to
get there in the first place he had to follow his rules religiously.
The same lesson is seen in sports. Even though Larry Bird was one
of the best basketball three- point shooters ever, he wasn’t perfect.
Let’s say on an average he hit 40 percent of his three- point shots. But
if all of a sudden he went on a streak where he missed fifteen in a row,
what did that mean? Could Bird afford to stop taking three- point
shots? No. That was what Dennis and Eckhardt were teaching.
Another great example of the statistical mindset Dennis and Eck-
hardt were teaching the Turtles can be found in baseball. Assume you
bat .300 for ten years straight. All of a sudden you go 0 for 25. Does
that mean you are no longer a .300 batter? No. It means you still
have to go up to the plate and swing like you’ve always swung, be-
cause that’s the discipline of being a .300 hitter. The Turtles played
the odds for the long haul.

The Turtles were taught not to fixate on when they entered
a market. They were taught to worry about when they will
exit.
Pretend again there are two traders, John and Mary. They are ex-
actly the same except in the amount of trading capital each of them
has. Assume John has 10 percent less money, but enters a trade be-
fore Mary. By the time Mary gets in her trade, they both have the same
amount of money. Eckhardt clarifi ed, “What this means is that once an
initiation is made, it should not matter at all to subsequent decisions
what the initiation price was.” He wanted the Turtles to literally trade
as though they didn’t know what their entry price was.27
Dennis kept bringing his teachings back to losses “The trader who
is averse to losses is in the wrong business.”28 The “secret” was what
he did with the wrong positions, not with the right ones.29 Managing
the losing trades (what Dennis called the “wrong positions”) allowed
traders to wait for the right ones (big trends). This is why the entry
price was only so important.
What Dennis and Eckhardt were teaching was the exact opposite of
Warren B uffett’s buying “value.” The Turtles were supposed to say, “I
want to buy or sell short markets that are in motion, moving up or
down, because markets in motion tend to stay in motion.” If markets
are moving higher, that’s a good thing. If markets are moving lower,
that’s a good thing, too. Dennis and Eckhardt wanted the Turtles to
profit from both.
Dennis was pushing his students go against basic human nature. He
said, “The single hardest thing I have to do to make people under-
stand how I trade is to convince them how wrong I can be about
things, how much of a guess it is. They think that there’s some magic
involved and that it’s not just trial and error.”30
C&D’s trading inspired a great deal of mystification, but in reality
they were a mass merchandiser who sold 90 percent of their products
as loss leaders so they could make a gigantic profit on the remaining
10 percent. Sometimes they had to wait a long time for good things to
happen. Most people can’t psychologically handle the wait.31
Look at this logic from a media company perspective. Like Dennis
and Eckhardt, movie producers and publishing executives know they

will have “losers.” A movie studio will fund ten movies. A book pub-
lisher will fund ten books. In both cases, the producers or publishers
often have no idea which one exactly of the ten is going be successful.
In fact, they might be lucky if one of the ten is successful. Since they
don’t know which one is going be successful, they still have to fund all
ten. If nine of those books aren’t successful, well, the publisher is only
going to print a small batch to begin with—that equals a small loss. If
those movies or books don’t do well, fi ne. They’re done. The compa-
nies cut their losses and get out. However, the movie or book that does
really well, the tenth one, pays for the losses from the nine losers.
The Turtles were taught to think of themselves as the publisher, the
movie studio, or the casino “house.”
Don’t try to predict how long a trend either up or down will
last. It is impossible.
Eckhardt gave the Turtles an example of a market moving rapidly
through the point where they were supposed to buy, but for whatever
reason had missed. Now they are sitting there waiting for a “retrace-
ment.” While they wait for the cheap place to buy, the market keeps
racing higher and higher. Eckhardt said there was “a great temptation
to reason that now it’s too high to buy. If you buy it now y ou’ll have an
initiation price that’s too high. However, it is imperative that you make
this trade. The initiation price simply won’t have the kind of signifi -
cance you suppose it will have after the trade is made.”32
The Turtles were not to wait for a retracement. There was no statisti-
cal justification to think like that. If they were trading soybeans at $8.00
and they went to $9.00, the Turtles were taught to buy them at $9.00
rather than wait for them to retrace to $8.00. They might never retrace
to $8.00.33
How would the Turtles have acted if t hey’d received a buy signal
for Google for the first time at $500? They would buy. Get on board
now was the thinking. Dennis always came back to the scientifi c
method, saying that when you have a position, you put it on for a
reason and y ou’ve got to keep it on until the reason no longer exists:
“You have to have a strategy to trade, know how it works and follow
through on it.”34

There is a flip side to this mentality, however. For example, on
Wednesday, November 22, 2006, Google opened the day at over
$510 a share. Within five days, by Wednesday the 29th, Google was
trading at $483, which means Google had pulled back nearly thirty
points. When it got to $510, could you know it was going to keep
going up or that it was going to go down? You c ouldn’t know either
way. What could you do? All you could do was let the price tell you
what to do.
Eckhardt was teaching math and rules to manage the emotions felt
in the face of uncertainty. He said, “Are you involved in emotional
personal memories as opposed to objective knowledge? What I’m
advising against is letting factors that are personal, emotional and id-
iosyncratic to your own history influence your trading.”35
Measuring volatility was critical for the Turtles. Most people
then and today ignore it in their trading.
The question Dennis and Eckhardt always asked was, “How big
should you trade based on current volatility?” In other words it’s not so
much the current price of a given stock or futures contract that is para-
mount, but rather knowing at all times the market’s volatility.36 For ex-
ample, it’s important to know that Microsoft is at a price level of 40
today, but it’s even more important to know Microsoft’s volatility (“N”)
now so you can buy or sell short the right amount of Microsoft based
on your limited capital.
Near the end of the breakneck training, Dennis and Eckhardt reiter-
ated the obvious to their newly trained Turtles. The successful students
in the class would be the ones who followed the rules and did not de-
viate. They did not want creative geniuses; It must have been ego-
deflating for Turtles once they realized, what Dennis and Eckhardt
were looking for was the equivalent of robots.
Investor Bradley Rotter, who has been called the very fi rst investor
with Dennis, saw their conundrum:
Applaud the genius of Richard Dennis. The program was well put
together. It was focused on discipline. It didn’t matter if a trade
felt good or felt bad, they had to just [do it]. It was a very, a very

simplistic trend following system that had an aggressive matrix to
add to winning positions and subtract from losing positions and

Note: For some readers, chapter 4 will be the only chapter on the
Turtle philosophy and rules worth examining. This book has been de-
signed in such a way that you can continue and dive into the “math”
that makes up the exact Turtle trading rules in chapter 5, while the ca-
sual reader can jump ahead to chapter 6 without skipping a beat.
For those interested in reading chapter 5, the following basic Wall
Street terms from Wikipedia.com should be assumed:
Long: One who has bought futures contracts or owns a cash com-
modity.
Short (noun): One who has sold futures contracts or plans to pur-
chase a cash commodity.
Short (verb): To sell futures contracts or initiate a cash-f orward con-
tract sale without offsetting a particular market position. Short selling
or “shorting” is a way to profit from the decline in price of a security,
such as a stock or a bond. Most investors “go long” on an investment,
hoping that price will rise. To profi t from the stock price going down, a
short seller can borrow a security and sell it, expecting that it will de-
crease in value so that he can buy it back at a lower price and keep the
difference.
Volatility: A measurement of the change in price over a given
period.
Futures contract: A standardized contract, traded on a futures
exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying instrument at a certain
date in the future, at a specified price. The future date is called the
delivery date or final settlement date. The pre-s et price is called the
futures price. The price of the underlying asset on the delivery date is
called the settlement price. The settlement price normally converges
toward the futures price on the delivery date. Both parties of a futures
contract must fulfill the contract on the settlement date. The seller de-
livers the commodity to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-s ettled future, then
cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the

one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settle-
ment date, the holder of a futures position has to offset his position by
either selling a long position or buying back a short position, effec-
tively closing out the futures position and its contract obligations. Fu-
tures contracts, or simply futures, are exchange- traded derivatives.
Market order: A buy or sell order to be executed by the broker im-
mediately at current market prices. As long as there are willing sellers
and buyers, a market order will be fi lled.
Stop order (sometimes known as a stop loss order): The comple-
ment of a limit order. It is an order to buy (or sell) a security once the
price of the security has climbed above (or dropped below) a specifi ed
price, known as the stop price. When the specified price is reached,
the stop order is entered as a market order.
Moving average: In finance, and especially in technical analysis,
one of a family of similar statistical techniques used to analyze time
series data. A moving average series can be calculated for any time
series, but is most often applied to stock prices, returns, or trading
volumes. Moving averages are used to smooth out short-t erm fl uctua-
tions, thus highlighting longer- term trends or cycles.

The Rules
“We have a pretty strict definition of a systematic trader. They
basically follow a set series of rules, established in a computer
program, that tell you when to buy or sell, how many, as well as
when to get out.”
Michael Garfi nkle,
Commodities Corporation
While the rules taught by Dennis and Eckhardt were not meant as a
statistics class, the Turtles did learn some basic statistics including two
“errors”:
A Type I error, also known as an error of the fi rst kind or a false
negative, is the error of rejecting something that should have been
accepted.
A Type II error, also known as an error of the second kind or a false
positive, is the error of accepting something that should have been
rejected.1
If the Turtles made those errors on a regular basis, they would be
finished with mathematical certainty. Said another way, they learned
that it was better to risk taking many small losses than to risk missing
one large profit. The concept of statistical errors was an admission that
acknowledged ignorance could be quite beneficial in trading.2
At the root of Dennis and Eckhardt’s statistical thinking was Occam’s
razor (a principle attributed to the fourteenth-c entury English logician
William of Ockham).3 In more contemporary jargon people express it
as, “Keep it simple, stupid!” For Dennis and Eckhardt’s rules to work,
to have some statistical reliability, they had to be simple.

Expectation:
How Much Does Your Trading Method
Earn in the Long Run?
“What can you expect to earn on each trade on average over the
long run from your investing decisions or your trading rules?” Or, as a
blackjack player would say, “What is your edge?” A first step for the
Turtles was to know their edge.
A good analogy is being a batter at the plate in a baseball game, as
trades and success rates aren’t much different from batters and their
averages. Dennis expanded on this: “The average batter hits maybe
.280 and the average system might be successful 35 percent of the
time.”4
More importantly what kind of hits did you get in hitting .280. Did
you hit singles or home runs? In trading, the higher the expectation,
the more you can earn. A trading system with an expectation of $250
per trade will make you more money than a system with a $100 per
trade expectation (all other things being equal in the long run). The
Turtle rules themselves had a positive expectation per trade because
their winning trades were many multiples larger than their losing
trades. Expectation (or edge, or expected value) is calculated with a
straightforward formula:
E � (PW � AW) � (PL � AL)
Where:
E � Expectation or Edge
PW � Winning Percent
AW � Average Winner
PL � Losing Percent
AL � Average Loser
For example, assume a trading system has 50 percent winning
trades. Now, assume the average winning trade is $500 and the
average losing trade is $350. What is the “edge” for that trading
system?

69
Edge � (PW � AW) � (PL � AL)
Edge � (.50 � 500) � (.50 � 350)
Edge � 250 � 175
Edge � $75 on average per gain per trade
Over time you would expect to earn $75 for each trade placed. For
comparison, another trading system might be only 40 percent accu-
rate with an average winner of $1,000 and an average loser of $350.
How would that system compare to the fi rst one?
E � (PW � AW) � (PL � AL)
E � (.40 � 1,000) � (.60 � 350)
E � 400 � 210
E � $190 on average per gain per trade
The second trading system’s “edge” is 2.5 times that of the fi rst
even though it has a much lower winning percent. In fact, the second
system breaks even with a winning percent of 25.9. The fi rst system
breaks even at 41.1 percent. Clearly, when you hear the media and
talking heads talking about “90 percent winning trades,” that talk is
misleading. Percent accuracy means nothing.
Look at it this way. Think about Las Vegas. A small edge keeps casi-
nos in business. That’s how those monster hotels in Las Vegas and
Macau are paid for—by exploiting the edges. Dennis always wanted
his trading to resemble being the house.
It didn’t necessarily matter how little the Turtles lost on any individ-
ual trade, but they needed to know how much they could lose in their
whole portfolio. Eckhardt was clear: “The important thing is to limit
portfolio risk. The trades will take care of themselves.”5
Trading Your Own Account Tip #1:
You need to calculate your edge for every trading decision
you make, because you can’t make “bets” if you d on’t know
your edge. It’s not about the frequency of how correct you
are; it’s about the magnitude of how correct you are.

Comparing the expected values of various Turtle and Turtle- style

perspective about the importance of expectation:

monthly expectation of buying and holding market indexes. Why? The

erage losing months.
Entries and Exits: “It’s Always Better to Buy Rallies”
Everyone wants to know, “How do you know when to buy?” The Tur-
tles were taught to enter trades via “breakouts.” A breakout occurs
when a market—any market (Cisco, gold, yen, etc.)—“breaks through”
TurtleTraderTheRules

a recent high or low. If a stock or futures contract made a fi fty-fi ve-d ay
breakout to the upside (long), meaning that its current price was the
highest price of the last fi fty-fi ve days, Turtles would buy.
If a stock made a fi fty-fi ve-d ay breakout to the downside, meaning
that its current price was the lowest price of the last fi fty-fi ve days,
Turtles would sell short, aiming to profi t as the market dropped. In iso-
lation there was nothing special about these simple rules for entry.
Philosophically, Turtles wanted to buy a market going up (becoming
more expensive) and wanted to sell short a market dropping in price
(becoming cheaper).
What about the standard Wall Street refrain of “buy low and sell
high”? The Turtles did just the opposite! And unlike most people’s un-
derstanding of the markets, pro or beginner, the Turtles actively aimed
to make money by “shorting” declining markets. They had no bias to
being long or short.
While breakouts were the reason to enter, those breakouts did not
mean a trend would continue by any measure. The idea was to let
price movement lead the way, knowing at any time the price could
change and go in a different direction. If a market went sideways, back
and forth, you could see how and why Turtle price breakouts produced
many small losses while they waited for a price breakout that might
produce the big trend.
No matter what price is the variable that the great traders have
lived and died by for decades. Making trading decisions more compli-
cated than the simple heuristic of “price” has always been problem-
atic. Eckhardt knew it was hard to do much better: “Pure price systems
are close enough to the North Pole that any departure tends to bring
you farther south.”6
Trading Your Own Account Tip #2:
Now that the concept of using price for your decision-m aking
is clear, stop watching TV! Stop looking at fi nancial news.
Start keeping track of the open, high, low, and close of each
market you are tracking. That is the key data you need to
make all of your trading decisions.

Trading Your Own Account Tip #3:
You need to be able to wrap your arms around the concept
of “shorting” a market. Or said another way, you have to
relish the opportunity to make money in a decreasing mar-
ket. Shorting was never unique to the Turtles; they just did it
effectively.
System One and System Two:
The Two Turtle Systems
The Turtles learned two breakout variants or “systems.” System One
(S1) used a four-w eek price breakout for entry and a two-w eek price
breakout in the opposite direction of the entry breakout for an exit. If a
market made a new four- week high, the Turtles would buy. They would
exit if/when it made a two-w eek low. A two-w eek low was a ten- day
breakout—counting trading days only.
While the System One entry rule is straightforward, the Turtles were
taught extra rules to confirm whether or not they should take the four-
week breakout. The extra rules were called “filters,” and they were
designed to increase the odds that when the Turtles took a four- week
breakout signal, it would continue as a potentially big trend.
The fi lter rule: The Turtles ignored the System One four-w eek break-
out signal if the last four- week breakout signal was a winner. Even if
they did not take the last four- week breakout signal, or even if it was
just “theoretically” a winning trade, the Turtles still d idn’t take the Sys-
tem One breakout. However, if the trade before a current four- week
breakout was a 2N loss, they could take the breakout (“N” was simply
their measure of volatility, discussed in the next section).
Additionally, the direction of the System One four-w eek breakout
was irrelevant in terms of the filter rule. If their last trade was a short
losing trade and a new long or short breakout hit, they could take
that breakout and get in.
But this filter rule had a built- in problem. What if the Turtles skipped
the entry breakout (since the last trade was a “winner”) and that
skipped breakout was the beginning of a hugely profitable trend that

roared up or down? Not good to be on the sidelines with a market
taking off!
If the Turtles skipped a System One four-w eek breakout and the
market kept trending, they could and would get back in at the Sys-
tem Two eleven- week breakout (see below). This fail- safe System Two
breakout was how the Turtles kept from missing big trends that were
fi ltered out.
System Two was the Turtles’ longer-t erm trading system. It used an
eleven-week breakout (fi fty-fi ve days) for an entry signal and a four-
week breakout (twenty days) in the opposite direction for an exit.
Trading Your Own Account Tip #4:
The price “breakout” was Turtle jargon to describe a market
that had just made a new high or new low over “x” period.
Do traders use other values beyond twenty and fi fty-fi ve days
for entry? Yes. The selection of these values for your trading
will always be subjective. Test or practice these rules on paper
and/or trading software (such as wealth- lab.com and mechan-
icasoftware.com) so you can see the ups and downs and gain
confidence. The Turtles typically put half of their money
toward each system.
Each Turtle had discretion over which of the two systems, System
One (S1) and System Two (S2), Dennis and Eckhardt gave them to use.
Mike Carr combined S1 and S2, allowing for more entry and exit
points. He was trying to smooth out his trading results.
Jeff Gordon preferred S1, but mixed in S2 for smoother returns.
Gordon, like some other Turtles, traded System Three (S3). He said
the systems were Dennis’s attempt to teach the Turtles that they
should follow his methodology and not venture off the reservation,
so to speak. Gordon added, “It was do anything you want to do, but
don’t lose more than $50,000 doing it. Once you crossed $50,000 and
one dollar, you were out of the Turtle program.”
Dennis called System Three (S3) the dreaded flair account. Erle
Keefer saw why S3 was not taking hold, adding, “You could do

whatever it was and everybody did it to a small degree, but within
about six weeks everybody just canned that account.”
It was canned because the Turtles had already lived emotionally
losing seven out of ten trades. They knew that was the right thing
to do. Keefer minced no words: “That was the only way you were
ever going to hook the real trend. We saw it work. I d on’t know any-
body that’s writing really good books called Counter Trend Trading
to Win.”
Trading Your Own Account Tip #5:
Feel free to experiment on breakout lengths. Do not fi xate
on specific values. The key will be to accept a breakout value
and stick with it consistently. Testing and practice are wise for
confi dence. Trust, but verify.
It is not surprising that over the years some traders—those who
knew the Turtle rules—became obsessed with the specific System One
and System Two entry and exit values as if they were the long- lost Holy
Grail. Traders who fixate like that are looking at the tree instead of
seeing the whole forest. For Turtle trading to work, the simplest of en-
try rules must continue to work. To get into debates about whether
entering on a fi fty-d ay breakout or a fi fty-o ne-day breakout is better
is misguided. In reality, a minor change of a variable in any robust
trading system should not cause significant performance changes. If it
does, you are in trouble.
Jerry Parker uses “robustness” as his guiding precept: “I think it’s
important to stay fairly simple—not a lot of variables. I think the reason
we make money? It’s the simple moving average systems. They need
to continue to do well.”
Parker used the Mount Lucas Management Index to make the point.
It is a trend-f ollowing index based on a fi fty-t wo-week moving average
that goes back to the 1960s. Parker knows that core concept is his
edge:
Two- thirds of that is what drives our profits. Our little filters to get
in early, to get out quicker, volatility filters, if that is how we’re

shape. The core simple moving average or breakout systems
[are key]. I think making our parameters longer term is impor-
tant, but the minute it takes too much thinking and too much
analysis and too much fancy work, it is going to be . . . a very bad
situation.7
The market ‘gurus’ who pretend that a complex approach must be
used to make money miss Parker’s point about keeping it simple. They
want the equivalent of quantum physics for trading rules. That kind
of thinking is mental masturbation, or as trader Ed Seykota calls, it
“math-turbation.”

The market “broke out” to a new four- week high early in 1995.
Then the market moved upward until a two-w eek breakout in the op-
posite direction in late April. The Turtles exited.
A great example of this process was seen early in Liz C heval’s ca-
reer. She bought 350 oil contracts for under $20 a barrel in July 1990
and hung on as prices rose above $40. On October 15, 1990, she
started liquidating at $38 a barrel and completed her liquidation at
just over $30 with an average exit price of $34.80.8
There was no discussion about OPEC, government reports, or other
fundamental factors used in Cheval’s decision- making. It was all about
the price action telling her to enter and exit. It is important to note
that Turtles always exited after the market went against them, thus
having to endure the painful experience of giving back profi ts. You

can’t pick the bottom and you c an’t pick the top, so trying to end up
with the “middle” of a trend was the goal.
Experiencing that trade made Cheval a believer. She said, “I re-

in a few minutes in the silver market in 1987.” That lesson helped her
to hang on when crude oil dropped from $30 to $25.9
Consider another example (chart 5.4), from November 2005 in Nat-
ural Gas Futures. Each dot represents a new fi fty-fi ve-d ay high. The
first breakout happened in mid-J uly 2005. There was no way to know
entering that breakout that a trend would continue higher, but it did,
and the Turtles just followed along making money.
However, that breakout could just as easily have been a loser. In
fact, Turtles could have had a string of losers in a row with multiple
false breakouts. Phil Lu used to say, “When you have a losing trade,
you say to yourself, ‘Hey, it seemed like the right thing to do at that
time.’ ” Exactly, following the rules means there will be losses. Trend-
following trader Larry Hite has long said, “There are four kinds of
bets. There are good bets, bad bets, bets that you win and bets that
you lose.”
Dealing with and handling losses is not easy. Jerry Parker has lived
the struggles of taking losses to win in the long run. He advises:
I used to say we take a small loss, but I think it’s better to take
an optimal loss. You don’t want to take one that’s too large
and yet you don’t want to have your stops so close that
you’re going to get bounced out. [Just] hang on to the trade.
Don’t get too excited. If you’re not making very much money,
that’s fi ne. If you got a little loss, t hat’s fi ne. If you make a decent
profit that turns into a loss, t hat’s fine. Just hold onto it and then
really get aggressive when you’ve been rewarded by a big, huge
profi t.10

“short” breakout occurred in February 2006 and the market contin-
ued to fall before reaching a low in June.
Chart 5.5: Turtle Short Entry and Exit Example Using Eurodollars.
The December 2006 Eurodollars made a new 55-day low, signaling an entry, on
February 20, 2006. The market briefl y moved lower before making a new twenty-
day high on March 16, 2006. Short positions in the market were exited with a loss.
On March 29, 2006, the market made a new low and short positions were rees-
tablished. The market continued making new lows before an exit signal, a new

By overlaying the twenty-d ay breakout exit on the Eurodollar chart,
the full trade can be seen in context. An initial “short” breakout oc-
curred in February, with a twenty-d ay high breakout in mid- March.
That forced an exit. That first breakout resulted in a small loss.
However, the market resumed downward in late March and an-
other breakout signal was hit. Turtles got right back in short again.
The final exit occurred when a clear twenty-d ay breakout high was
made in July. This is seen on the chart by the slightly larger dot. Prof-

its generated on the second trade covered the loss from the fi rst
trade and then some.
That’s the process. The Turtles could not afford to ignore the sec-
ond breakout just because the first breakout resulted in a loss. They
had to get back on the horse. The second breakout was the trade they
were hoping for, and there was no way to predict it.
It was all a waiting game. Erle Keefer described to me their day-t o-
day process in rapid-fi re summation terms: “First, you use channel
breakout theory with a couple of filters. Second, you are going to size
your bet by volatility. Third, you are going to have two hard stops on
every trade. You are going to have the natural liquidation and you are
going to have the firm hard stop. T hat’s what saved everybody. Rich’s
systems inherently said, ‘You got to stay in the game all the time as
you never know when trends are going to hit.’ ”
Random Entries
When a breakout occurred, whether long or short, there was no way to
know what would happen next. Maybe the market would go up for a
short time and then go down, giving a loss. Perhaps the market sud-
denly goes higher, giving a nice profi t.
Eckhardt witnessed many systematic traders spending great deal of
time searching for the “good” places to enter. He cautioned against it:
“It just seems to be part of human nature to focus on the most hopeful
point of the trading cycle. Our research indicated that liquidations are
vastly more important than initiations. If you initiate purely randomly,
you do surprisingly well with a good liquidation criterion.”11
Dennis actually challenged the Turtles to randomly enter the market
and then manage their trades after getting in. That was a real Zen mo-
ment for many Turtles. If they applied appropriate risk management,
they could handle the worst that came down the pike once they were
in any trade.

Risk Management: How Much Do You Bet on Each Trade?
Risk management has many names. You will find it called money man-
agement, bet sizing, or even position sizing. It was the very fi rst con-
cept Eckhardt addressed in class and ultimately the most important.
Turtle risk management starts with the measurement of daily market
volatility. The Turtles were taught to measure volatility in terms of
“daily ranges.” It was nicknamed “N” (also known as the Average True
Range, or ATR). They were taught to take the maximum of the follow-
ing for any market to derive “N”:
1. The distance from today’s high to today’s low
2. The distance from yesterday’s close to today’s high
3. The distance from yesterday’s close to today’s low
If the result is a negative number, it is turned it into an “absolute
value.” In mathematics, the absolute value of a real number is its dis-
tance from zero on a number line. So, for example, 3 is the absolute
value of both 3 and �3.
The maximum value of the three choices is the “true range,” or
technically the absolute distance (either up or down) the market trav-
eled in a given twenty- four- hour period. The Turtles then took a
twenty-day moving average of true ranges. This gave a sample volatil-
ity for the last few weeks for each market traded.
Trading Your Own Account Tip #7:
You can determine the average true range for any stock or
futures contract. Simply take the last fifteen true ranges, add
them up, and divide by 15. Repeat each day, dropping off the
oldest true range. Many software packages will do this auto-
matically.
Eckhardt explained the logic behind “N”: “We found that volatility
is something that can be described as a moving average process. Our

incorporation of a volatility element in our trading—something that
tells us how large our positions should be—has both kept us out of
trouble during the tough times and allowed us to capture large gains
when things are going our way.”12
The Turtles were taught multiple uses of “N,” but first they had to
calculate it. Consider this example of “N” calculation:

If the “N” for corn was 7 cents and the market was up 5.25 cents,
then the market was up three- quarters of an “N.” That’s Turtle jargon.
So “N” is a volatility measurement and a useful rule of thumb to clas-
sify how far a market has trended. Erle Keefer rattled off Turtle jargon:
“When we put a bet on, we never said, ‘I am putting on a $1,000 bet.’
We were taught to think in terms of ‘N.’ ‘I got a one-h alf N on.’ We
were taught that way because for most people, if they start to think,
‘I’ve got $34 million in bonds on,’ then the concept of money gets
into their lizard brain and they start saying, ‘Oh, my God!’ We learned
the correct way to think was, ‘How much did the market move today?’
It didn’t move thirty-o ne ticks in the bonds, it moved one and one-
quarter ‘N.’ ”
The below chart shows “N” plotted below a bar chart of Dell.

dated. Eckhardt updated his volatility estimates every day. He said,
“That’s my routine. Two or three times a year I make an adjustment
intra-day.”13
Once they had a feel for “N,” the Turtles were instructed about
how much to “bet.” They bet a fixed 2 percent of their capital on
hand on each trade. If they had $100,000, they would bet (or risk)
2 percent ($2,000) on each trade. Each 2 percent bet of their equity
was called a “unit.” The “unit” was jargon that they used every day
to measure risk.
They had unit limits on any market sector and unit limits on the total
portfolio. The unit fluctuated so that every day the Turtles knew how
many contracts to have on based on how much money they had in
their trading account at that instant.14
Trading Your Own Account Tip #8:
Take your account (whatever size it is) and multiply by 2 per-
cent. For example, a $100,000 account would risk 2 percent,
or $2,000 per trade. It is always better to bet a small amount
initially on any trade in case you are wrong—which can easily
be greater than 50 percent of the time. While the Turtles
typically used a 2 percent bet, you can reduce your risk and
reduce your return by decreasing that number to, for exam-
ple, 1.5 percent, etc.
The Turtle risk management dictated their stops, their additions to
positions, and their equalization of risk across their portfolios. For ex-
ample, a corn futures contract (a standard corn contract is worth $50
per cent) with an “N” of 7 cents has a risk of $350 (7 cents � $50). If
the Turtles received a corn breakout signal (using a 2N stop), they
would have had a “contract risk” of $350 � 2, or $700.
Assuming a $100,000 account, they would have had an “account
risk” of $2,000 (2% � $100,000). The number of contracts to buy or
sell is determined by taking the 2 percent account risk and dividing it
by the contract risk. That gives 2.67 ($2,000/$700) futures contracts.
Turtles rounded down to the nearest whole number. So when their

breakout signal was hit, they traded two corn contracts for their
$100,000 account.
The rules made a corn unit equal to a gold unit equal to a Coca-
Cola unit. This was how Dennis was able to trade markets as “num-
bers” with no fundamental expertise in any of those markets. It was

Ten-Year Notes $525 $1,050 $2,000 1.0
how the Turtles were able to trade such a wild cross-s ection of unre-
lated markets with only two weeks of training.
However, the Turtles learned another use of “N” beyond a mea-
sure of volatility. It was also used as their primary stop (or exit rule, as
first mentioned with S1 and S2). The Turtles used a 2N stop. This sim-
ply means that their primary stop, or hard stop, was two times the
daily “N.”
For example, if there was a breakout in corn, and assuming a clos-
ing price of $250, Turtles quickly determined their “N” stop. If the “N”
was 7 cents, a 2N stop would have been 14 cents. The stop would
have been 14 cents behind the entry price. An entry at $250 would
have a hard stop at $236 (250 � 14). You would exit if the stop at price
level $236 was “touched.” No second-g uessing. No overthinking. Fol-
low the rules.

Chart 5.9: Chart Showing Soybean Daily Bars with Daily ATR.
Daily price chart of May 2004 Soybean Futures shows a smaller ATR at the begin-
ning of the trend. A smaller ATR allows for more contracts to be traded via Turtle
money-management rules. By the end of the trend, ATR has expanded greatly,
reducing the size of the position you can have on. Source: Price-Data.com.
On the other hand, a small “N” allowed Turtles to trade a larger
position or take on more units. Soybean units purchased in August
(chart 5.9) at the beginning of the breakout were 2.50 times larger
than units that could have been bought at the end of the trend. This
example is a great reminder of the relationship between market vola-
tility and unit size: A low “N” value always means more contracts (or
shares).
Jerry Parker found that his best trends often start with very low vola-
tility at the initial breakout entries. He said, “If the recent volatility is
very low, not $5 in gold, but $2.50 in gold, then w e’re going to throw
in a very large position.”15
Parker’s analysis kept showing that a low “N” measurement at the
time of entry was a good thing. He said, “I can have on a really large
position. And when volatility is low, it usually means that the market

has been dead for a while. Everyone hates the market, has had lots of
losers in a row, tight consolidation. And then as it motors through
those highs, we get on board.”16
Unit Limits
It didn’t matter whether the markets were futures, commodities, cur-
rencies, FOREX, or stocks. One unit of corn, through the Turtle rules,
had now roughly the same risk as one unit of dollars, bonds, sugar, or
any other market in the Turtles’ portfolio.
However, the Turtles could not trade unlimited units. Each unit, after
all, represented 2 percent of their limited and fi nite capital. The Turtles
had unit guidelines to keep them from overtrading. For example, they
were limited to four to five units for any one market traded.
Thus, trading like a Turtle could leave you with a $100,000 portfolio
that might have purchased one bond contract, but a $1 million portfo-
lio might have purchased five. As the bond contracts gained in value,
others would be added.17
Examples of Initial Risk Determination
The following examples show the basic Turtle trading process in action.
1. Assume a trading account of $150,000, risking 1.5 percent on
each trade and seeking to trade Swiss franc futures using a 2N
stop. The Swiss franc has a single “N” dollar value of $800.
$150,000 � 1.50% � $2,250
2N stop � $1,600
The number of contracts to trade on this unit is 1.40, rounded down
to 1.0.
2. Assume a trading account of $25,000, risking 2.0 percent on
each trade and seeking to trade mini corn futures using a 3N
stop. Mini corn has a single “N” dollar value of $70.00.

$25,000 � 2.0% � $500

The number of contracts to trade on this unit is 2.38, rounded down
to 2.0.
The unit rules make good intuitive sense once the light bulb goes
off. However, that light bulb did not turn on immediately. One Turtle
described the learning curve: “When somebody says, ‘N is volatility
and N is your unit size,’ I say, ‘How do I know the difference between
them?’ It’s really like wrapping yourself around a conundrum, but
after a while it was easy. Pretend I am talking to Liz Cheval, ‘I have
got a half unit on and I am three N up’ or ‘I have got a half N unit on
and I am half N positive.’ I totally understand the difference between
them. Don’t even have to think about it. This is burned into your
brain.”
Pyramiding: “Adding to Winners”
Once they understood S1 and S2 entry and exit rules, once they un-
derstood “N” and units, Eckhardt then instructed the Turtles to pile
profits back into winning trades. This maxing out of their big winners
was part of what helped to create the Turtles’ fantastic positive expec-
tancy, or “edge.”
For example, a market bought at a price breakout level of 100
could have additional units added as the market moved through price
levels of 102, 104, and 108. Assume a long breakout entry at 100 with
an “N” value of 5. Assume that you will add another unit each 1N
move. A new unit will be added at 105, 110, etc. Turtles could pyramid
a maximum of 5 units. They set their stops at 1⁄ 2N on the first day of
trading and from that point forward, 2N stops were used. Then, once
the second unit was bought, both stops were brought up to the new
unit’s 2N stop. As new units were added, all stops were brought up to
the stop of the newest unit added.
This process protected open profits, but not to the extent that
it would jeopardize catching a very big trend. This thinking also aimed
to guarantee that profits would be plowed back into those big

With this kind of pyramiding, you could have a $300,000 account
that was long five units containing Canadian dollars, U.S. dollar in-
dexes, the S&P 500 index, unleaded gas, orange juice, yen, Swiss
francs, gold, soybean oil, and cotton. By Turtle trading logic, they
would be net long one unit, or 2 percent of the total portfolio.18
Risk of Ruin:
“Will You Live or Die?”
Aggressive pyramiding of more and more units had a downside. If
no big trend materialized, then those little losses from false break-
outs would eat away even faster at the Turtles’ limited capital. How
did Eckhardt teach the Turtles to handle losing streaks and protect
capital? They cut back their unit sizes dramatically. When markets
turned around, this preventive behavior of reducing units increased
the likelihood of a quick recovery, getting back to making big money
again.
The rules were simple. For every 10 percent in drawdown in their
account, Turtles cut their trading unit risk by 20 percent. For example,
TurtleTraderTheRules



==================================================
                     PAGE 109                     
==================================================

93
if they were trading a 2 percent unit and if an 11 percent draw-
down happened, they would cut their trading size from 2 percent to
1.6 percent (2.0 � 80%). If their trading capital dropped down 22
percent, then they would cut their trading size by another 20 percent
(1.6 � 80%), making each unit 1.28 percent.
When did they increase their unit sizes back to normal? Once their
capital started going back up. Erle Keefer remembered one of his
peers saying, “Oh my God, I am down so much that I have to make
100 percent just to get back to even.” But that Turtle ended up the
year with a nice bonus, because the markets finally started clicking
(and trending). Keefer added, “When the statistics finally all work and
all those markets start moving, those ‘hot wires’ can start pulling you
up pretty fast from a drawdown.”
For example, let’s say you are at $10,000 and you keep losing,
then you win a little, then you lose a little. You are now down to
$7,500. You are probably trading 40 to 50 percent of your original unit
size. All of a sudden everything goes back up to $7,800. It goes up
to $8,000, and you start restoring unit size. The Turtles could be
down eleven months and one week into the year and then in the last
three weeks of the year go from being down 30 or 40 percent to up
150 percent. Look at their month-b y-month data from 1984 to 1988
(see Appendix). When the markets kicked in, it was a wild ride.
By reducing positions when they were losing money, the Turtles
countered the arithmetic progression toward “ruin” effectively.19 Den-
nis and Eckhardt’s logic makes good conceptual sense, even for non-
math novice traders.
Eckhardt did not want the Turtles to worry about linear decreases in
their accounts. The slightest exponential curve from a big trend would
eventually surpass the steepest linear curve they saw while losing. Dis-
cipline, money management, and patience were the only ways it
would work.20
This day- to-day routine, however, was mundane. Every day they
would come in and there would be an envelope with their name on it.
That envelope would have their printouts with their positions. It in-
cluded updated “N” values, too. That’s right, the Turtles did not have
to worry about the basics of calculating “N.” Of course, they learned
TurtleTraderTheRules



==================================================

==================================================

94
the hows and whys of “N” from Eckhardt, but the time-c onsuming
calculations were done for them. The Turtles simply picked up their
envelopes and checked to make sure their positions and orders were
all as they were supposed to be.
Liquidation (Exit) Rule Summaries
There were two basic “stops” or exits to get Turtles out of their trades:
1. The 2N stop.
2. The S1 or S2 breakout exits.
The Turtles were instructed to take whichever stop hit first. For ex-
ample, assume you enter any market. Your 2N stop is quickly hit, and
you exit with a small loss. That’s easy. On the other hand, perhaps you
enter a market and it takes off. A monster trend zooms either up or
down. In that case, your S1 or S2 breakout stop would get you out
with a profi t.
This was stomach- churning. David Cheval lived this process working
with his then wife Liz Cheval. He said, “When we have good profi ts,
then we’re very aggressive with those profi ts. We’ll risk 100 percent of
the profit in a trade if it d oesn’t follow through based on our system.”
The Turtles could have had a 50 percent profit in a market, but their
stop still might be at their predesignated risk of 2 percent. It was pos-
sible for them to lose all of that profit plus the 2 percent.21
Portfolio Selection and
Position Balancing
This philosophy applied to all markets, meaning as long as liquidity
and a selection of quality markets existed (and today there is no short-
age of those) and there is some inherent volatility in that market
(Turtles need movement after all to make money), any market could be
traded like a Turtle.
The Turtles initially traded these markets:

Trading Your Own Account Tip #11:
There is no one set portfolio you can trade. Today, traders
trade Turtle-l ike rules across widely differing portfolios
(stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, etc.). It is a primary
reason traders have differing performances. There is also no
one starting capital number that can be promised as an elixir
for all traders. Some start with small money and get huge.
Some start with big money and don’t make it. You will see in
later chapters the other pieces of the trading puzzle beyond
these rules that separate winners and losers.
However, it was critical to avoid having one of highly correlated
markets. In simple terms, think of correlated markets typically moving
together in lockstep. Too many potentially correlated markets in a
portfolio and the Turtles increased their unit risk.
For example, the Dow Jones Industrials stock index and the S&P
500 stock index are highly correlated. Both move up and down to-
gether. Buying one unit in the Dow and then buying one unit in the
S&P is like having two units in either market alone.
Or, assume both Apple and Dell were in a T urtle’s portfolio. Both
stocks go up and down together like clockwork. Proper Turtle trading
strategy would dictate one unit of Apple. However, if one unit of
Dell was also bought, since these two stocks have high correlation,
this would be essentially trading double the amount of Apple that

should be traded. To trade both stocks was to take twice the risk you
should take.
Look at table 5.17. Notice that both columns in each table have the
same number of markets. They could easily have the same number of
units. However, the “More Risk” table has more markets highly corre-
lated to each other. Corn and soybeans, gold and silver, and the two
note contracts are all highly correlated. Essentially, Turtles would be
trading only four markets. The “Less Risk” table shows a broader
grouping of markets with less correlation. For example, historically the
Japanese yen and crude oil do not move together.
The Turtles were also taught that combining long and short units
into their portfolio offered further diversification. In fact, when they
combined long and short units, Dennis and Eckhardt discovered that
they could actually trade more overall units. This was how they were
able to load up on so many positions. While they appeared overlever-
aged in others’ eyes, Dennis and Eckhardt had the Turtles safely under
risk management (unit) guidelines.
Consider another portfolio example. Assume it is long units in corn,
feeder cattle, gold, and Swiss francs, for a total of four long units. Also,
assume it has short units in British pounds, copper, and sugar, for a
total of three short units.
To calculate the total Turtle unit risk, you would take the smaller
number and divide it by two. Then you would subtract that number
from the larger number. In this example it would be 4 � (3/2), giving
2.5 units of risk. This is how the Turtles added more units without add-
ing more risk.
Why did the Turtles diversify so much? There was no way they could

That was it. Boom. Two weeks of training, at the Union League
Club, was done. With those rules in hand, they entered D ennis’s offi ce
space in the old Insurance Exchange building next to the Chicago
Board of Trade. They took his money and started trading.
However, the Turtles were given one more mandate that super-
seded all the philosophy and rules: Practice. Sure, it might sound cli-
chéd, but it was reality. To put it in perspective, many people see
winners like Tiger Woods and make innumerable excuses about why
he is great and they are not: “He started learning golf as a toddler.”
“He is a natural athlete.” “He earned his titles during a time when golf
was lacking top- notch competition.”
The truth? Woods is great because he has the discipline of practice
ingrained in him. Look at the tape of him on Johnny Carson when he
was three or four years old. Practice, practice, practice—all the time.
Woods is famous for saying, “No matter how good you get you can
always get better and that’s the exciting part.” That mentality is mis-
sion critical for both golf and trading.
Medicine is yet another field where skills develop as a result of re-
petitive training. Research shows time and time again that medical
students are often clumsy at their first tries at performing even such
basic procedures as finding a vein to tap for blood work.23 However,

their process of focusing on repetition and discipline consistently pro-
duces many competent doctors with long and successful careers.24
For the Turtles there was going to be nothing glamorous—just as
with doctors practicing to fi nd a vein. At the end of the day, their train-
ing was surely not what they expected (of course how could they have
really known what to expect?). But they never truly got a “secret”
sauce. As one Turtle put it, “Richard didn’t quite give us the Holy Grail.
There’s no single magic element.” Magic or not, once the Turtles
finished class they immediately went to work. However, before they
started making big money, there were rough patches.

“It’s possible to train people to perform to a certain level in chess,
but if this training does not promote self- education and a philo-
sophical attitude, then the trainees will be little more than per-
forming seals.”
Nigel Davies,
Daily Speculations
How many Turtles were there? The number of Turtles is in dispute.
Dennis and Eckhardt not only included people selected from want
ads in the training room, they also invited an assortment of colleagues
who were already working for them. Other people in the offi ce entou-
rage, who were close enough to pick up the essential concepts of what
they were teaching, ended up exposed to the Turtle rules.
Take, for example, Mark Walsh. Walsh was not an offi cial Turtle,
but someone who has traded like a Turtle for twenty years. With a track
record of better than 20 percent average annual performance, he is
an equal to Turtles who managed money for clients since 1988. Sam
DeNardo, a generally accepted Turtle, didn’t want his defi nition of
the Turtle club violated: “I love Mark Walsh, I’ve known him for a
long time but he wasn’t really a Turtle . . . And I think the Turtles,
the real Turtles, feel strongly about keeping the group true to what the
list was.”
DeNardo also argued against Craig Soderquist as a Turtle even
though the Wall Street Journal had referred to him as one: “Soderquist
was somebody involved in Rich’s life at the time who maybe got a
couple guys’ notes from the meetings.” However, Robert Moss, head
of Richard Dennis’s trading- floor operations in New York from 1984
to 1988, stated without a moment’s hesitation that Soderquist was a
Turtle. Moss’s job was to execute daily for C&D Commodities

thousands of futures contracts across New York trading pits. He would
know.1 Yet Jeff Gordon, a verified Turtle, disagreed with Moss, saying
that the Turtles were only those who traded Dennis’s money.
Clearly, many people, official Turtles or not, learned the methods
simply because they were close to the action in the C&D offices. It was
easy to see that once Dennis and Eckhardt started the training phase of
their experiment, it was similar to the informal seminars Dennis and
Tom Willis had held in the 1970s. Training was open to a much wider
circle than Turtles hired via the ad would have preferred.
The refinements and distinctions as to who was and who was not a
Turtle went right to the heart of what was to become a serious competi-
tion. They might have all been told they were equal, and perhaps they
were initially, but this was no game. Millions of dollars were on the
line.
The Office Environment
Within the offices of C&D Commodities, the Turtles were Dennis’s
pet project. They were viewed as worker bees freeing him up for bigger-
picture political initiatives.2 Robert Moss said that they were “essen-
tially a stable of ‘little Richards,’ no pun intended.”
That stable had very little in personal oversight once they were
trained. Russell Sands, for one, was surprised at the complete lack of
supervision. He noted, “We might have seen Rich, Bill, or Dale once a
week on a Friday afternoon for two hours.” According to Sands, they
would walk in and say, “How did you guys do this week? Anybody have
any questions?” That was it.
If one of the Turtles did not follow the rules, Dennis and Eckhardt,
who reviewed their daily statements, would call up and ask for an
explanation. Sands added, “But aside from that, there was no mentor-
ing; there was no supervision, there was nothing. We were totally on
our own.” It was, “ Here’s the money, keep a journal, write down every
trade you took and why you took it.” The Turtles would become more
famous and successful over time, but in the beginning there was no
fanfare.
The working conditions were Spartan. Dennis provided them with
a large trading offi ce sandwiched between two fl oors in the Insurance

Exchange building. It was furnished with metal desks and chairs. The
most basic amenities, such as a coffee machine or TV, were missing.
There was a bookcase with trading books that hardly anyone ever read.
Eventually a Ping- Pong table was brought in.
The Turtle seating arrangements were reminiscent of grade school.
They were seated two by two, with six- foot-t all dividers between the
cubicles. The informal, no- frills environment was typical of the way
Dennis ran his business and his life. Mr. Anti- Establishment was pass-
ing his attitude down to his students.
This attitude left others in the building wondering what the Turtle
office was up to. After all, they had all kinds of downtime trading as
trend traders. They would go days without trading. On top of that, there
was no dress code. They used to show up to work in the summer in cut-
offs and T-shirts.
A Harvard MBA worked side- by-s ide with a recent high school grad-
uate. A Jehovah’s Witness played Ping-P ong with a blackjack player
from Eastern Europe. Jewish and Christian students were mixed into
one diverse offi ce.
Consider Anthony Bruck, a wiry and fashionable Chicago socialite
and artist. He reminded some of Andy Warhol. He’d come to work
dressed in skin- tight black clothes. Bruck, like Jim Kenney, was a friend
of Dennis before the experiment started.
Erle Keefer loved the wild diversity of what was almost a mini United
Nations: “You had people who didn’t have a college degree, then peo-
ple who had doctorates. Anthony Bruck had a doctorate in linguistics.
Actually, I think that probably helped him to be a good trader because
you had to think about it analytically and conceptually.”
Mike Carr was a terrific demonstration of Dennis’s eclectic hiring
policy. He c ouldn’t spell “future” (as in trading futures), so to speak, in
the beginning. Carr, like other newbie Turtles, had to be shown a chart
and how to read it. He was living proof that you did not need a Harvard
MBA to excel.
Even more unusual was the inclusion of Lucy Wyatt. For years,
people who were aware of the Turtle story have assumed that there
was only one female Turtle, Liz Cheval. But it turns out that there
were two.
Wyatt was a friend of William Eckhardt’s. Jim DiMaria noted:

“While the rest of us were like Turtles and that’s what we were and
that’s what we did, she would kind of come and go. She did actually
have a desk . . . in the room. I guess maybe that’s the Turtle barome-
ter . . . you have a desk in that room.”
Off the record, several Turtles who’d been hired through the screen-
ing process commented that having Dennis employees and friends in
the room trading as Turtles caused strife. One said, “The regular Tur-
tles, so to speak, wondered how in the hell were they ever picked
for this program. The ones not picked via a screening process just didn’t
have the mental horsepower for it.” All one Turtle could remember
about Wyatt was that she was always doing her nails.
Mike Cavallo said that Wyatt had been Eckhardt’s girlfriend. He
noted, “She was in the room with us. So of the people, if you were go-
ing to say who was a Turtle and who w asn’t, she would have been con-
sidered to be the least likely to be called a Turtle.”
Did Wyatt trade? Apparently yes. Many people who hear the Turtle
story make excuses for why they could never fit in. Wyatt made it clear
that anyone could have fit in with the Turtles.
Wildly differing political views did not keep Turtles from fi tting in,
either. Jerry Parker and Richard Dennis, for example, were political
opposites. Mike Shannon painted Parker in extreme terms: “[He was]
about as right-w ing conservative as you can get and we had people in
there who were more liberal than Rich by a long shot.” Shannon got a
kick out of the political diversity crammed into the one- room offi ce.
He said, “Jerry was far right and at the time I was more far left. We
would really lock horns once in a while on certain political and social
issues. He is so far right. It’s just unbelievable. I just never really took
him seriously in that regard.” However, Shannon did take Parker seri-
ously as a trader, saying, “He’s very good. But the funny thing is with all
of that, when it came to the actual trading and discussing the systems
and methodologies, we were all on the same page. No matter what the
political background or social background, we all tried to cooperate as
much as possible.”
These political differences were no small matter. Jeff Gordon
learned this firsthand at a dinner before the 1984 presidential election.
Everyone knew Mondale was Dennis’s guy. Dennis started going
around the table asking everyone who they were voting for. One by

one, they all said, “Mondale.” They were all his guests, and Dennis
was one of the richest guys around. However, when it was G ordon’s
turn he said, “Gary Hart.” Gordon knew he had just upset the trading
king of Chicago.
However, far more important than any political differences were the
commonalities. Mike Cavallo saw all the Turtles as extremely bright,
but viewed the group as an interesting mix of competitive and easygo-
ing people. He believed that the great majority of the Turtles could
have a day filled with total disasters yet still be pleasant.3
In hindsight, it’s hard to know for sure if the Turtles were like what
Cavallo described or if they ultimately became like that as a result of
their unique situation. No one was going to make waves when a rich
guy was giving out millions to a group to trade with an incentive plan
to make their own millions. That kind of opportunity kept mouths
closed.
The Turtles, however, d idn’t immediately realize that they had been
given the “golden goose” for making millions. Since they had to hit
the ground running, they did not have time to test the rules Dennis had
given them. They had to trust Dennis and Eckhardt implicitly.
Erle Keefer, hired in the second Turtle class, was in the minority
with his desire for a “proof of concept.” Like his mentor, Keefer re-
mained skeptical: “You said I learned about the golden goose, but I
didn’t have a computer program, hadn’t seen printouts, hadn’t seen
proof of concept. You know what I mean?”
As time went on, some Turtles did test the rules Dennis gave them.
This effort changed the direction of the Turtle program. Still, initially,
the Turtles executed their trades based on the rules they had been
taught. They were making big money doing so. In fact, all were now
making more money than they ever had in their lives. At that moment,
everyone associated with C&D Commodities was certain that they had
proven nurture trumps nature—even if no one outside of the fi rm knew
this yet.
A Boring Trading Strategy
The Turtles experienced what the term “free time” really meant. There
simply was no trading if a market didn’t move. Not trading when there

was no market movement was, in fact, one of the most important rules
of all. No trending market, no profit. No market moves, no calling
Robert Moss to place trades.
These long periods of doing nothing would be considered useless by
today’s hyperactive crowd, in love with checking stock quotes every
minute. However, the Turtles would have had no need for hot tips from
the likes of Jim Cramer of Mad Money or CNBC’s David Faber’s latest
“breaking” news story.
Today, people gobble up dozens of trading infomercials and nightly
advice from everyone under the sun on what to buy and sell. All of this
was useless to the Turtles. Today’s get- rich- quick crowds have created a
whole culture of traders afraid of missing something. They obsess about
analysis about what the markets have done or are going to do—even if
it has no direct connection to their trading decisions. The Turtles, on
the other hand, were perfectly content to do nothing when the rules
said to do nothing.
The Turtles would come in every day already armed with their war
plans so that they didn’t make bad decisions in the heat of the battle.
Stare at the screen and it’s going to say, “Do something, trade me.” All
top traders today work like hell to develop a trading philosophy. They
convert that philosophy to rules. After that, they stand back and see if
their rules act as expected. If you build a system that gives you an
entry and exit, tells you how much to bet along the way and adjusts to
your current capital and current market volatility at all times, no more
analysis is needed.
The Turtles did not fight this boring state of affairs. However, every-
one handled downtime differently. Jerry Parker, for example, played
electronic baseball until he had figured out all the tricks. Does that
mean Parker was goofing off and not trading properly? No. Far from it.
Parker was always prepared. Self- discipline meant doing nothing until
the time came to do something. Parker knew what role they played in
Dennis’s life when he said that Dennis ran the training “because he
wanted to have a certain chunk of money traded using systematic rules”
while he went on and tried out new techniques.4
But for now, their trading was all about downtime. It was for the
Turtles a deliberate process of following about thirty markets, wait-

ing to do something. They didn’t trade foreign markets at the time;
many of those were yet to be invented. Their basket of markets was
not very active.
The Turtle think tank did have occasional undercurrents and per-
sonal biases, particularly when it came to Liz Cheval. This was Chi-
cago trading in the early 1980s, and some Turtles thought sexism was
an issue. The fact that some Turtles may not have taken Cheval seri-
ously was not easy to deal with. Michael Shannon said, “Between guys
hitting on her and guys shunning her and stuff, it kind of made her
somewhat ambivalent to the whole Turtle process.”
Cheval appreciated the fact that she was getting a great education in
the program, but she may have had some residual animosity toward
other Turtles. Shannon added support: “A lot of people just underesti-
mated her. You have to remember this was the ’80s. How many women
commodity traders did you know at the time?” Even though they were
the Turtles, it clearly did not mean they were all behaving with the
decorum of choirboys.
Jiri Svoboda used his inordinate amount of downtime for other
ventures beyond trading. He was always trying to figure out ways to beat
the house. This, however, was not gambling in the way most people
think of it. His view was all about understanding the odds and making
money.
Svoboda had no problem leaving the office for two or three months
at a time. Other Turtles made sure his trades got placed properly once
Svoboda had worked out all of his if/then contingencies. In turn, he
then spent much of his time in Las Vegas developing systems that could
read cards being dealt at blackjack tables.
This behavior was fine within the parameters of the experiment, be-
cause Dennis himself had created the atmosphere of “get the job done
and I don’t care where you are physically.” By giving Turtles his rules,
his money, his brokers, and his ATRs (the computed daily volatility for
each market, or what they called “N”), Dennis had taken away much
of the day-t o-d ay routine the Turtles would have been experiencing
had they been trading entirely on their own.
The trading day unfolded with the Turtles tracking their group of
markets. If one or more of those markets generated an entry or exit

signal, they picked up the phone, called to the trading floor, and made
the trade. Then they would wait for the market to move one way or the
other before picking up the phone and calling the fl oor again.
The Turtles were on their own Survivor island. They marked all of
their charts and made all their calculations on loose- leaf paper. If they
wanted a Wall Street Journal, they had to buy it. Dennis of course would
have paid, but he was a technical trader, not a fundamental guy. There
was no reason to study the Journal every day.
Think about how many people in 2007 read the Wall Street Journal
daily from start to finish searching for fundamental insights. Consider
how many people scan annual reports or crop reports online. Not the
Turtles.
Everything they did was basic. The Turtles would actually write
down their orders for the next day and make a carbon copy. They would
leave the carbon copy behind, in case they couldn’t make it in the next
day. That way their orders would still be executed properly. Jim Di-
Maria laughed, “People don’t even know what carbon paper is any-
more.”
Beyond the day- to-d ay office idiosyncrasies, the physical locations of
the Turtles would soon change dramatically. For that first year they
were all in the same offi ce, but after that some left. Mike Cavallo was
in the office for one year before he moved home to Boston to continue
working for Dennis long distance. Russell Sands was gone after the fi rst
year, too—he left the program completely.
Their office environment was slowly changing as time went by. Jim
DiMaria said, “At some point, half the people, like Jerry Parker, moved
back to Virginia (his home). So those of us Chicago people who wanted
to stay, we moved to a smaller office. But the dynamic was gone at that
point.”
Early on, when everyone was together in Chicago, there were bond-
ing moments as they labored in the trenches with little outside guid-
ance. They were not expert traders out of the gate—far from it. To
begin with, almost all the Turtles were in their twenties or late teens. It
wasn’t long before the first-y ear class was down 50 percent each on av-
erage six months into the program. If you think some of them were
panicking, you’re right.
Still, out of those early volatile performance swings came personal

anecdotes that put their daily grind into perspective. September 1985,
for example, was a difficult learning moment. The “Group of Seven”
finance ministers made a concerted effort to weaken the U.S. dollar.
Over the weekend they changed their policy on the dollar. All of the
currencies quickly gapped a couple of hundred points higher. Some of
the Turtles were short.
Jeff Gordon, who had exited his positions, remembered that Tom
Shanks was still short. He said, “You have to imagine, here we are,
managing millions of dollars, we come in [Monday], we have these
positions and the market is so much against you. We have large posi-
tions, we’ve just lost a horrendous amount of money, through no fault
of our own.” Gordon was pointing out that Shanks was following
Dennis’s rules and that by following those rules exactly, he had incurred
signifi cant losses.
Even though the Turtles were given precise rules. Dennis’s weak-
ness for discretionary decisions rubbed off on his students. In theory
they all had the same rules for selecting markets to trade, when to enter
and exit, and how much to buy and sell. However, there were ongoing
incidents of exceptions to the rules.
One of those exceptions involved a cocoa trade. Erle Keefer vividly
recalled it: “Cocoa is going out the roof. We generated the whole move
because we were allowed to add on. We had the whole market. The
guys on the floor knew it was R ich’s traders, but they just kept the mar-
ket going. We push it up another ten points and they add on. We are
shoving that through the roof and when our buying dried up, the mar-
ket collapsed. We all got stung hard because honestly we were loaded.
Phil Lu was the only one who didn’t have any cocoa positions.”
During the Turtle program, Dennis had a policy that one day a year
all Turtles would individually go to lunch with him. They got to trade
with Dennis for the day, so to speak. When Phil Lu came back from his
day with Dennis, he thought Dennis was unhappy with him. Dennis
wanted to know what caused Lu not to take the cocoa trade. Lu’s deci-
sion to not take the trade clearly was against how they had been
trained.
Lu had a reason. Each day the Turtles had to write down their con-
tingencies for the day. Lu, who never really had the intense trader drive,
simply had two pieces of paper listing his if/then contingencies, his buy



==================================================
                     PAGE 124                     
==================================================

and sell points, for each market each day, and his second sheet listed
cocoa. It turns out that Lu had a rule that if he had two pages and if a
trade wasn’t on page one, he wouldn’t trade it. Cocoa was on page two
for him.
Dennis said, “Why didn’t you trade cocoa? What told you?” Lu said,
“Oh, I only trade stuff that is on my first page and cocoa wasn’t on my
first page.” Lu thought he saw Dennis’s face fall. After all, Dennis, ever
the curious skeptic, had hoped he was about to learn something new
from one of his students.
Lu’s trading was a great example of the imprecision within the Turtle
world that could and did lead to different levels of performance. It was
the type of incident that showed even though the Turtles were doing
exceedingly well trading, there were reasons for differing performance
numbers.
Dennis’s hiring process loaded the experiment up with real charac-
ters. Perhaps the most colorful background of any Turtle was that of
Mike Shannon.
At one point I asked Shannon if there was anything else to know
about the whole Turtle process. He said bluntly and out of left fi eld,
“You know that I was a criminal, right?” Before explaining himself, he
said his story deserved a disclaimer. First, his transgressions were twenty-
five years ago, and second, he is very anti- drug today. He then explained,
“Probably about two or three years before I joined Richard Dennis, I
was a drug dealer. I used to control about maybe 80 percent of the drug
traffic within the Rush Street nightclub scene in Chicago.”
Other Turtles confirmed his account, but this unusual story kept
unfolding long into the Turtle program. After he had been working for
Dennis for fifteen months or so as a Turtle, Shannon was called to tes-
tify in a federal drug case for the government. Dennis found out and
called him into the office. Shannon thought he was going to be let go
when Dennis reached into his briefcase and pulled out a transcript of
the trial. Dennis was stern: “Now look, I am not going to fire you if you
tell me the truth. Just tell me the truth, what’s going on?” Shannon
gave up the whole story about his drug- dealing past and his current side
gig working for the FBI. Dennis was shaking his head. “Are you done
with them?” Shannon had no clue whether they were done with him.

Shannon was convinced that Dennis was the reason his problems
went away. He said, “I was well into the Turtle program and I was a
little profitable as well. I think if I was a marginal trader he might have
cut me loose.” Shannon said that Dennis’s political connections ended
his nightmare, adding, “So, I have no criminal record.”
Another Turtle said about D ennis’s handling of Shannon, “Rich
grew up around a lot of pretty tough guys, being in the trading business
and everything else. Rich knew that there was always another story. By
his nature Rich is an amazingly forgiving person.”
Throughout the Turtle blowouts, quirky trading decisions, and a fed-
eral narcotics investigation, Dennis treated his people right. On one
occasion he flew the entire C&D entourage to Las Vegas to see the
rock band Blood, Sweat and Tears (he was a 1970s music afi cionado,
after all). Even though he might have led an outwardly frugal life, Den-
nis was generous to everyone he came in contact with.
The Group Dynamic
The Turtles were exposed to ideas with tremendous power, but those
ideas did not come without a price. Human nature was always at play.
It was one thing to practice applying Dennis and Eckhardt’s rules on a
blackboard, but learning how the rules performed in live action was
critical for confi dence.
In this sense, the Turtles’ training had unmistakable parallels with
the U.S. Army Rangers’ training regime. The Rangers work under the
assumption that extraordinary performance can’t come from rehears-
ing under ordinary conditions. Elite troops can be forged only from
extraordinary challenges that force them to draw upon emotional and
physical reserves they never knew they possessed. Trading for Dennis
was the same. The Turtles had been taught how to handle their worst-
case trading scenarios and to feel confident in any trading situation but
it wasn’t easy.5
Gaining confidence, whether Turtle or Ranger, involved a setting.
The Turtles were in an empty office learning their way; the Rangers
were in physical training pit learning theirs. Both groups always had
the eerie feeling that someone was watching over them. In a way the

Turtles and Rangers were both trapped, though voluntarily. They had
signed over their lives to people they didn’t know with the expectation
that those people would subject them to pain.6
Of course, the Turtles did not endure the physical pain of Ranger
School, but they certainly endured psychological pain while they
gained confidence in their ability to trade. Whether intentional or not,
the Turtle office environment fostered a tribelike atmosphere.
And many Turtles saw their group, or tribe, dynamic as crucial while
they were in the womb trading Dennis’s millions. Erle Keefer felt the
psychological need: “The reason we all needed to stay together, espe-
cially in the beginning, was we literally made all our money in a nor-
mal year in about a three- week period. The rest of the year, most people
were down minus 30 percent. And then the markets all clicked in and
we had bullets to fire because of Rich’s money management scheme.
You can go from minus 30 percent down to a plus 150 percent up in
three weeks with no trouble at all.”
Slaving away together as comrades- in-a rms was important because
they were getting the crap kicked out of them on a day- to-d ay basis,
with lots of small losses and very little positive reinforcement. When
the big trend came it was great, but they still had to patiently wait for it
to happen.
Imagine sitting there day after day with a multimillion-d ollar trading
account funded by a guy who is Chicago’s trading royalty. And imagine
that the account appears to be slowly dwindling away, little bit by little
bit, even though you are doing what you are supposed to do. There was
self-d oubt. There was concern. The group dynamic helped the Turtles
alleviate stress and reassure each other that they were all doing the right
thing.
As time passed, though, the Turtles saw D ennis’s system making
huge amounts of money from big trends. They finally had the psycho-
logical assurance of “I know this works in my gut, and you can’t take
that away from me.”
However, even with the tribelike atmosphere, even with the Ranger
parallels, even with learning in their guts what it really meant to trade
like Dennis, as evidence accumulated, it showed that the group process
had ultimately turned out not to be significant. T hat’s because the
“Turtle trading tribe” was ultimately undermined by an unexpected

threat: competition and jealousy. Liz Cheval addressed the rivalry head
on when she declared, “At the end of the day, the numbers are there in
black and white. Either you made money or you didn’t.”7
The Turtles would soon learn that trading for Dennis over the four-
year life of the program was more complicated then the black-a nd-
white world described by Cheval. The Turtle trading experiment was
about to become an experiment inside an experiment, with newly con-
fident Turtles just as quickly burdened with self- doubt.

Who Got What to Trade
“It’s interesting where the truth ultimately ends up. What you read
on the front of the newspaper and what really happens can often
be the difference between black and white.”
Anonymous Turtle in interview
When the Turtles first started working together the atmosphere was
pretty carefree. After all, they had been selected and trained by the trad-
ing king of Chicago. But their complacency was short lived. In just a
few months they became the equivalent of insecure earthlings being
analyzed from afar—just like in an old Twilight Zone episode. The
initial experiment of nature versus nurture was one thing, but now
there was another experiment underway, intentional or not.
Money was mother’s milk in a Turtle’s world. Since without Dennis’s
money to trade, there would be no Turtle program. But soon the Tur-
tles learned that there was little rhyme or reason when it came to how
much money each of them got from Dennis to trade. This was no small
matter; it made the difference between making millions or not. Again,
the movie Trading Places comes to mind, with the scene in which Billy
Ray exclaimed, “The whole thing was an experiment, fool! And you
and me were the guinea pigs! They made a bet over what would hap-
pen to us!”1
Sam DeNardo, a first- year- class Turtle, who received a $1 million
allocation from Dennis but rationalized away the smaller amounts
given to second- year- class Turtles. He thought Dennis figured he didn’t
need to risk as much with the second-y ear class: “He started those guys
up with different amounts. It would have been nice to know at the time
how fast he wanted us to go, how aggressive, or how conservative. I
think that was part of what he was trying to discover.”
The outside world was hearing that the Turtles had it made in the

shade, but behind the scenes Dennis was making unequal allocations
to his students. His action created tension within the ranks, but no one
was about to complain openly. After all, they, were making more money
than they ever had before. Yet being a Turtle was clearly a double-
edged sword.
Jeff Gordon, discerned overall friction before allocations even be-
came an issue. He saw some people in the Turtle program as being
there only because of a previous acquaintance with Dennis, while oth-
ers were hired through the ad. Dennis referred to the people who had
had a connection with him as a “control group.” Gordon said, “They
were just chosen for other reasons.”
Gordon and several other traders thought the people like him (those
who had been hired and screened from the want ads) were superior
traders. Dennis thought there was no difference. This was small pota-
toes to the real office tension to come.
With different amounts of money being allocated, the Turtles started
to earn wildly different amounts. Mike Cavallo, for example, was one
of the early leaders. He described everyone as doing well initially, but
said that then in the spring of 1984 they all got crushed.
At that point, midyear, when the Turtles in the first class were all in
the red, Dennis came in and said that they were all trading well. He
then increased their equity. This made no sense to the Turtles. They
were shocked. They were down big, and Dennis was going to give them
more money?
Cavallo could not believe it: “I might have thought he’d say, ‘Well, I
think the program has been a failure. I’m going to close you down.’
Instead, he increased equity especially for a few of us that he thought
who were trading the best. I was one [along with] Curt [Faith] and How-
ard [Seidler]. I guess we were trading the best at that time.” The word
“best” made little sense when comparing Turtle performance data (see
Appendix). They were all going up and down as a group in general.
Over time, however, the ones who perceived unfairness in the dispa-
rate allocations became frustrated. Erle Keefer said some Turtles spoke
up vociferously about the allocation of money. He recalled, “You’ve got
guys like Curt Faith and Mike Cavallo who go down to minus 50 per-
cent, minus 70 percent and not only are they given a reload, but they’re
given even more money.”

==================================================

Who Got What to Trade 115
They all sat in the classroom together. They all learned the same
rules. They then went to the office together and initially all received
the same amount of money to trade. Almost out of the gate everyone
started to lose, but some of the biggest losers were given even more
money to trade.
Many Turtles thought Dennis was subjectively guessing who was
going to be a great trader, as opposed to letting the actual trading results
dictate greatness. The rub for many was that Dennis and Eckhardt al-
ways argued that trading should be based on true logic. Now some saw
Dennis allocating money in a “losing game” fashion, meaning they
could not understand why he was not using the scientific method in
his trading allocations just the way he had taught the Turtles to do in
their trading.
More and more frustration boiled over at how herky- jerky the alloca-
tion process had become. In 1986, for example, the money manage-
ment business as a whole had a very difficult year. Jeff Gordon was
quick to point out his success: “I produced plus 65 percent that year
without a double- digit drawdown.”
How did Dennis reward Gordon in terms of an allocation for the
next year? Dennis decreased his allocation and his incentive fee. It
seemed to resemble a science experiment: “Add acid to base and note
the reaction.” However, it was Dennis’s game, and he alone had the
right to make the rules.
Gordon was frank about his ultimate difference of opinion with
Dennis and the eventual outcome: “He didn’t like my risk control.
Well, he was the guy making the decisions. Did I appreciate that? No,
because I knew how I had done. On a reward- to-r isk basis I was wiping
everybody else out.” Dennis’s act of lowering Gordon’s incentive fee,
which no matter his allocation meant less profit, was not interpreted
well: “After that I wasn’t terribly enthusiastic about remaining in the
Turtle program. I wasn’t providing Rich what he wanted. I left the pro-
gram in July of 1987.”
But Gordon had a problem, however. Like all Turtles, he had signed
a contract to trade exclusively for Dennis for five years. If he quit the
program, he could not trade for others. Gordon knew what he was up
against. “You didn’t want to get into a lawsuit with somebody who has
$200 million,” he said.

==================================================

Dennis did not care whether Gordon had a “decent” risk-a djusted
return. Dennis wanted big rewards—absolute returns. It is not surpris-
ing that Dennis cut Gordon prematurely. Given D ennis’s strong philo-
sophical underpinnings (“follow my rules”), and given the fact that
Dennis and Gordon had political differences (Gordon supported Hart
in the 1984 presidential race, not Mondale), this appeared to be as
much about butting heads as about making money.
But Gordon was not alone. Echoing similar concerns, Jim DiMaria
addressed allocations as well: “I think the first year [Turtles] were all
given the million-d ollar trading limits to start. Then in the second year,
there were eight of us. I think three were given a million, two were
given $600,000, and three were given $300,000. I was one of the
$300,000 ones, which is fine. It was still a job. I was a little surprised,
but we did get a draw.”
Dennis and Eckhardt matched DiMaria’s prior $18,000 salary, but
the Turtle allocation process was a mystery. DiMaria said, “Everyone
sort of believed in ‘the market is never wrong’ and ‘technical versus
fundamental,’ but then when the money distribution went out, it was
like there was no correlation between who got the money and what the
performance was.”
DiMaria was at the bottom in equity and near the top in perfor-
mance. That type of discrepancy continued throughout the whole pro-
gram. Adding fuel to that fire was the common knowledge that, one
turtle was soon getting twenty times what others got.
It bears repeating: The Turtles all had the same rules and the same
training. At the same time their earnings were based on an incentive
structure tied to their total account value, and some Turtles were trad-
ing millions while some were trading thousands. T hat’s a formula for
internal strife. Conversation after conversation regarding allocations
peeled away the rivalries and ill will below the surface.
As time marched on under Dennis’s roof, it became apparent that the
one Turtle who got the largest allocation of all was purportedly not fol-
lowing D ennis’s rules as taught. Almost every Turtle brought all discus-
sions back to Curtis Faith, who had perhaps half the money in the
program at one point. DiMaria was blunt: “His trading was pretty erratic.
He’d have great months, but he took enormous risks to get there.”
In 1989, the Wall Street Journal described Curtis Faith as “the most

successful Turtle.” The article included a chart showing the perfor-
mance numbers of fourteen Turtles, but conspicuously absent from the
chart were Faith’s performance numbers. Only in the text of the article
was there mention of “trading records” showing that Faith made about
$31.5 million in profits during the Turtle program.2
However, if you look at the big picture this headline was problem-
atic. If Faith was trading the most money, and hence earning the most
from incentive fees, then the Wall Street Journal was in severe error by
saying he was the most “successful” Turtle. To appreciate the imbal-
ance between Faith and the other Turtles, consider an example: Trader
“John” is given $20 million to trade and trader “Mary” is given $20,000
to trade. They both get a 15 percent incentive fee and both produce
plus 50 percent returns. It can’t be said with a straight face that John is
unilaterally more successful.
During research, I found a chat forum posting with what appeared
to be an inside view of the Turtles’ allocations. The post reiterated the
$31.5 million that Faith purportedly made, but also said that the entire
Turtle group “made around $100 million.” This chat forum posting
emphasized that Faith had made 30 percent of the total. It concluded
with faulty logic, “What Jerry Parker made 5 years later trading a much
larger equity base is not relevant.”
That posting conveniently left out the critical fact that Faith was
trading upward of twenty times the equity base of other Turtles. In other
words, Faith made more because he was trading more. But there are no
performance numbers demonstrating that he was the best- performing
Turtle.
However, as long as the risk Faith was taking was within the param-
eters, this was not considered a big deal. DiMaria was quick to correct
that view: “No, not within the parameters. That was sort of the standing
joke. There were parameters and then there were Curtis parameters.
He just got to do whatever he wanted. It’s as if the whole thing was de-
cided on ‘who knows what?’ criteria. Who were going to be the good
traders and who weren’t? And returns be damned. It was totally funda-
mental. It was, ‘Mike Cavallo, he’s like the smartest guy in the pro-
gram. We got to give him a lot of money.’ I was at the other end of the
spectrum. Maybe because I was a control person and they thought I
wasn’t going to be anything.”

Faith saw it differently, saying there was a certain amount of vari-
ability when they were taught the S1 and S2 trading systems. He saw
his subjective choices as key to his success. Faith was also the most
openly competitive in his public statements about his experience. It
could be that when Faith said he wanted to beat everyone in the room,
he was motivated by his lack of a college degree (Jehovah’s witnesses do
not advocate college as part of their religions practice). Or he simply
may have had a healthy “I will show them” chip on his shoulder.
At first blush, DiMaria’s initial comments could have been “sour
grapes.” However, they w eren’t made purely out of self- interest; he saw
other Turtles getting the short end of the allocation stick. He said,
“George Svoboda was an absolute genius and probably had the poten-
tial to be the best trader of all and might be.” However, as the program
went on, many Turtles saw that the correlation between trading success
and the amount of money they were given by Dennis as not very good.
Yet DiMaria added, “I think at the end of the first year I was one of
the top performers, if not the top performer. My bonus was like $10,000
when other people were getting $600,000. I had a kid and all and it was
tough. It was very, very diffi cult.”
Twenty years later, the regret of not being given the opportunity to
trade a larger account for Dennis still comes across in DiMaria’s voice.
There was a touch of Rodney Dangerfield’s “no respect.” However, it is
worth noting that today DiMaria has a continuous month-b y-m onth
track record dating back to 1988. That’s a twenty year track record in
stark contrast to Faith’s lack of performance numbers over the last
20 years.
While many Turtles like DiMaria thought Dennis was playing favor-
ites, Mike Cavallo bluntly disagreed. He thought allocations were all
performance driven. In 1984, Dennis decided that trading grains w asn’t
worth his time anymore. He gave those grain accounts to Howard
Seidler, Faith, and Cavallo to trade.
Talk about even more tension. Everyone in the room knew about
these grain accounts. They all knew they created the potential for trad-
ing much larger, with the chance to earn much more through incen-
tive fees. Cavallo agreed: “I would say, sure there was some jealousy. I
think it’s just human nature. People are in this great job that’s so much
better than anything they’ve ever done, so much fun, and so lucrative,

and who are now making six- figure incomes for the first time, get jeal-
ous of the people making seven- fi gure incomes.”
Although no one knew to the penny what other Turtles were mak-
ing, it was obvious some were trading much more money than others.
Everyone was worth basically the same when the Turtles started. Then,
within eighteen months to two years, a few Turtles were millionaires
and many were not, but all the while everyone was generating very
similar returns. This was tension personifi ed.
Cavallo also saw more than just allocation issues at play. He wit-
nessed some Turtles who were less confident in their trading. There
were Turtles actually imitating other Turtles. He saw a few trying to
piggyback others’ trading orders.
However, in the end, it all kept coming back to allocations. For in-
stance Jerry Parker was not happy about being allocated such a small
amount either. Parker thought he was trading just as well as the Turtles
who were getting the big allocations. The performance numbers sup-
port that. At one point in 1986, Parker was trading $4.2 million for
Dennis. Then, in 1987, he was trading $1.4 million. Parker made plus
124 percent for 1986 and plus 36 percent for 1987.
Erle Keefer said that politics was the reason why Parker received
smaller allocations from Dennis. Keefer said that Parker believed that,
too. He said, “Jeff Gordon and Jerry are the political polar opposites of
Rich. Jerry was about the biggest polar [opposite].”
Dennis was giving positive reinforcement in the form of larger alloca-
tions not only to Turtles who were willing to take bigger risks, but also
apparently to those with whom he had become closer friends. Parker
was a Republican. Obviously, he w asn’t Dennis’s favorite Turtle.
Parker may have been the first Turtle hired, but Dennis was still a
human being. Keefer added, “He still had his favorites. Curt was a fa-
vorite. Mike Cavallo was a favorite. Then you look at some other peo-
ple and you say, ‘Why did they get less money?’ Maybe they just d idn’t
want to pull the trigger on big numbers?”
Parker was by no means the only Turtle whose allocation was cut
back after big performance runs. Many other Turtles with seriously
eye- popping performance had their money under management
slashed. Liz Cheval, Paul Rabar, and Mike Carr all had their alloca-
tions cut.

The fear of not knowing what to expect next was a constant in the
Turtles lives. Turtles would get calls without explanation to increase or
decrease 20 percent of their account size. They scratched their heads,
wondering what was going on. Some Turtles joked that perhaps they
were in a cruel psychological experiment. Others seriously considered
the possibility that they were being filmed like Jim Carrey in the Tru-
man Show.
Mike Cavallo, who viewed the allocation process as a meritocracy,
did end up having some questions, too. He thought Dennis was partly
awarding trading aggressiveness, placing bigger bets with Turtles he
thought were trading better, but even Cavallo could not understand
Dennis’s decision-m aking logic when it came to Faith. He said, “It
seemed like Curt was trading too aggressively and too riskily and yet
was getting rewarded for it. He was making the most, although proba-
bly not on a risk- adjusted basis. So at the time, it was just sort of puz-
zling. I’m not particularly a jealous person, so I wasn’t too worried
about it.”
Cavallo knew Dennis had become very successful as a very young
man by taking big risks. The implication was that Faith was Dennis’s
chosen one. Others said the C&D brain trust were enamored with the
fact that Faith was so young.
It become increasingly apparent that the whole subject of alloca-
tions issues was just an entry into the central sticky issue of the pro-
gram: favoritism. The disparity began almost out of the gate. There was
a heating oil trade only weeks after the Turtles’ initial training in 1984.
The Turtles were supposed to be trading much smaller sizes. They
were supposed to be trading “one lots” or just one futures contract.
Faith apparently traded much larger and made more money than all
of the other Turtles. Cavallo thought Faith had exceeded what they
were allowed to trade, but he also thought an arguably reckless or “go
for the jugular” attitude may have elevated him in Dennis’s eyes.
It kept coming across loud and clear from assorted Turtles: F aith’s
trading didn’t reflect what they’d been taught. Cavallo, the Harvard
MBA, was brutally honest: “It wasn’t at all what we were taught. In fact,
you could say it was slightly counter to what we were taught.” Even
though Cavallo was making millions and was easily considered a top-
grossing Turtle at the time, the fact that Dennis gave more and more

==================================================

Who Got What to Trade 121
money to Faith perplexed him. Cavallo had no ax to grind in talking
about Faith. In fact, years later he served on the board of directors of a
firm Faith had started.
Why was Cavallo concerned about Faith’s style of trading? He wor-
ried that Faith was risking so much that he could ultimately be ruined
(as in mathematical risk of ruin). From that fi rst day of class Eckhardt
had pressed home the point of managing risk, but many Turtles saw it
almost immediately being ignored by one of their own.
DiMaria, who was only eighteen months older than Faith, saw ev-
eryone playing by the rules during the program except Faith. He said,
“That would go to position sizing, markets traded . . . he was the spe-
cial boy wonder. So he could do things that the rest of us c ouldn’t. He
probably doesn’t realize that. Did he have special rules ahead of
the game, or did he change the game and then ask if those new rules
were okay?”
Jeff Gordon was the first to broach Faith’s religion. He said, “Curtis
was a Jehovah’s Witness. A person of faith, a religious person, someone
who you’d think would have morals. I am not saying that Curtis does
not have morals or religious convictions. But when it came to handling
Richard Dennis’s money, Curt could have cared less if he lost it all.
That’s how he conducted himself. The fact of the matter is, in retro-
spect that appears to be what Rich wanted. Rich wanted people who
would be really aggressive.”
The most remembered and controversial trade in the program
was that 1984 heating oil trade. All the Turtles were trading $100,000
in the first month, and Faith made much more money pyramiding
than the others. Dennis loved it. Gordon was shocked: “It was actually
kind of strange because Curtis started getting personal calls from Rich,
and he would come in the morning and say, ‘Hello, well Rich and I
were talking last night and he said, ‘da da da.’ Nobody else was getting
these calls.”
Faith saw the 1984 heating oil trade differently, saying that he bought
three futures contracts per the rules and quickly added the maximum
twelve contracts he was allowed. Heating oil went straight up, and all
of the Turtles had big profi ts.3
But Faith, said he saw something odd in the other Turtles’ trading.
He said he was the only Turtle to have “on” a full position. It was F aith’s

view that every single other Turtle had decided for some reason to not
trade the system as Dennis and Eckhardt had taught them. He won-
dered if they had even been in the same class with him.4
Because this was a very volatile trade, the price of heating oil soon
plummeted. The Turtles began to exit. Faith believed that the right
thing to do was to hold on (and not exit) as heating oil dropped. Soon
it began to rise again, surpassing the previous high. Faith was appar-
ently the only Turtle with all twelve contracts “long.” He said, “We had
all been taught exactly the same thing but my return for January was
three times or more than the best of the other Turtles.”5
Mike Cavallo and Russell Sands both reinforced the point that Faith
had a helping hand that other Turtles did not have. They said Dennis
guided Faith at the liquidation point on this trade. It appeared that
Faith was in a special “no fail” setup to which the other Turtles were
not privy.
Was all of this tension designed by Dennis just to see how other
Turtles would react? Or was Faith getting extra ongoing instruction
because he and Dennis had become friends?
Mike Shannon connected the dots in very human terms: “I think
some of the Turtles had different motivations for doing what they did. I
did it because I just found at the end of the day, I just truly enjoyed the
experience. You take guys like Jim Kenney and Anthony Bruck, I think
their view was a little bit more artistic. Curt Faith, on the other hand,
was driven by his father. His father was a Jehovah’s Witness and he had
to pay a tithing to the church. It was like his dad was a stage mom al-
most . . . [He] would come up and we’d look at this guy and some of
their beliefs are just a little bit off the wall.”
Now, Mike Shannon was no angel, but his words revealed a real-
world picture of the goings-o n in the office. The bottom line: Given
the millions Faith was trading, given the clear allocation discrepancies,
given the clear discontent, this drama over allocations and extra assis-
tance was just as much a part of being a Turtle as the rules they were
taught.
Shannon was sympathetic when he described the situation: “[Cur-
tis] made no secret of it. Look, he wasn’t running around giving us
copies of [Jehovah’s Witness brochures] or anything bizarre like

that . . . He was pretty upfront about it. He would say, ‘The church I
belong to and blah, blah, blah and all that.’ ”
Perhaps Richard Dennis had become a father figure for the young
Faith. Shannon added, “Rich really likes Curt a lot.”
The Performance
The personal and perhaps subjective descriptions of what was taking
place are fascinating, but the bottom line is performance data. Sol
Waksman of Barclays Performance Reporting was the only person I
could find with copies of the Turtles’ month- by- month performance
while they were under Dennis’s umbrella.

Dennis better than the monthly ups and downs of the raw performance

I found the omission odd that Sol Waksman did not have Curtis
Faith’s numbers from inside the Turtle program. Faith said that his
performance numbers were not available because he never constructed
an approved track record for his years trading Dennis’s money, prevent-
ing him from giving his exact Turtle performance numbers.6
However, how was it even possible that Faith could be trading so
much more money than other Turtles? Dennis had a lot of money, but
not an infinite amount. Other Turtles said money was being taken from
their accounts and given to Faith’s account.

Who Got What to Trade 125
Interestingly, once F aith’s account got really big, things apparently
went south. One Turtle saw Faith losing much of his gains in a 1987
silver trade; it was his contention that all of the money Faith had ever
made for Dennis may have been lost on that one trade.
Other Turtles talked about this silver trade, too. One said that Faith
didn’t exactly follow the system because he had “gotten a feel for it.”
When silver finally spiked down from a big run- up, he saw Faith as the
last trader actually trying to exit.
Faith admitted that he was in error. In the EliteTrader.com chat fo-
rum, he said it was his single worst mistake trading: “I was holding
1,200 contracts of Comex Silver, yep the 5,000 ouncers for 6,000,000
ounces for Richard Dennis’s account. This along with 500 contracts of
Comex Gold. Rode it all the way up and almost all the way down ac-
counting for a whopping �65 percent drawdown in the account. The
equity swing on the high- move day for the account from the high to the
low was something ridiculous, like $14 million.”
At the end of the day there was no way to verify the exact amount
Faith lost on that silver trade, and there was no way to verify Faith’s
exact $31.5 million profi t figure while working for Dennis either. In
trying to do so, I talked with reporter Stanley Angrist who wrote that
1989 Wall Street Journal article nearly twenty years ago. He told me
that he had no way to verify Faith’s earnings. He received that $31.5
million number from Faith himself.
While this silver trade may have been one of the fi nal behind- the-
scenes sagas within the Turtle experiment, it certainly wasn’t the last
one. Once the idea of taking too much risk and not following rules was
on the table, it was as though a dam broke. David Cheval, Liz Cheval’s
former husband, saw more than one Turtle in the fi rst year ignore the
rules and take excessive risk. He said, “I also believe that Rich increased
the stake of several traders because they blew out the initial stake—not
necessarily because they were the top traders.”7
Curtis Faith disagreed saying that it wasn’t really possible to blow out
the initial stake. He said that if the Turtles lost 50 percent on a closed
trade basis they would not have money to trade.”8 Fifty percent was not
a cutoff point. Turtles clearly breached that, and the data proves it.
However, when it comes to allocations there will always be a mystery,



==================================================

with assorted inconsistencies as everyone protects their real or per-
ceived reputations twenty years later.
That said, the allocation story had an ending. Sam DeNardo zeroed
back in on allocations as he saw the second- year group of Turtles be-
coming destabilized. They were concentrating a lot on “How come
you got $50,000 where I got $200,000?” or “Why did you get $600,000?”
He saw them worried that they had done something wrong in Dennis’s
eyes. DeNardo even tried to ease tensions by writing Dennis a letter to
warn him that there was destabilization in the Turtle ranks. “They were
fighting amongst each other,” he said.
Keefer also sent a brief letter to Dennis questioning his allocation
formula. He believed that if Dennis had done nothing more than give
an equal allocation to all Turtles, for example $5 million, he would
have made much more money. He said, “I’m quite certain that it didn’t
endear me to Rich a whole lot when I wrote the paper saying, ‘Here’s
how the logic of asset allocation should be in this kind of a game.’ ”
Keefer, who thought Dennis deserved a Nobel prize for his real-
world work in harnessing volatility in his trading models, lamented the
allocations aspect of the program: “You’ve got somebody t hat’s got
an awesome trading system and he’s following really rigidly good proto-
cols about trend trading and then he just literally blows it up on asset
allocation.”
It was DeNardo, however, who got punished for questioning alloca-
tions—he got cut from the program. Dennis interpreted his letter as
trying to make excuses for his losses. DeNardo said he followed the
rules, but not always: “I remembered buying sugar when I should have
been selling it. I just said, heck, ‘I’ll buy some.’ Well, I get called in for
that. ‘You s houldn’t do that. It’s counter trend.’ Well, I never did it
again. Let me tell you, they knew what you were doing.”
The Memo
While Dennis and Eckhardt always knew what the Turtles were
doing, it turned out that the two mentors didn’t always know what
they were doing. During all that downtime of waiting for the markets
to trend, four Turtles from the second class (Tom Shanks, Paul Rabar,
Erle Keefer, and Jiri “George” Svoboda) formed a small group to do



==================================================
                     PAGE 143                     
==================================================

Who Got What to Trade 127
trading research. They wanted to validate their rules instead of just
playing by them.
While the rest of the Turtles may have been reading the sports pages
and playing Ping-P ong, this group spent their time building a systems
testing platform. Doing that took them a year. The results of their re-
search project shook the program. They determined that Dennis had
everyone taking far too much risk.
The Turtles had all been trading according to rules taught by Den-
nis and Eckhardt and were making millions, but the research team,
using original Apple computers, blended the S1 and S2 trading systems
(see chapters 4 and 5) together and found that instead of a worst- case
�50 percent drawdown, they were consistently getting a worst-c ase �80
percent drawdown.
Paul Rabar intuitively figured out the problem occurred when both
systems (S1 and S2) got the entry breakout signal at the same time. At
that moment they were putting on too much risk.
Dale Dellutri had somewhat arrogantly always said to the Turtles, “If
you guys ever invent anything bring it to us.” Dellutri was clear that he
never really expected that to happen, so turning over this new research
was going to be a delicate matter. Dennis and Eckhardt’s attitude was,
“We know this trading cave, and we know it better than anyone else.”
And given the success they had had, why not think that way?
However, the research team had determined the guys in the cave
were off by a factor of 100 percent, and they told Dellutri. Soon after-
ward, Dellutri came out and ordered everyone to reduce their position
sizes by 50 percent going forward.
On the heels of Dellutri’s order came the official memo from Den-
nis dated April 23, 1986. It said:
Real- world drawdowns far in excess of theoretically expected val-
ues have caused us to reassess the linkage between theory and fact
regarding how big to trade. It seems that we have misconstrued
the theoretical data so that you have been trading as much as
twice as big as we thought. The good news is that this has
been true throughout the whole trading program—your profi ts
were doubled, but at the cost of a doubling of the risk. We must
be living right.9

                     PAGE 144                     
==================================================

128 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
Dennis went on to reiterate what Dellutri had already told them:
They would soon have to cut back their trading by 50 percent. He
wanted to turn the Turtles’ risk- taking back to what they expected it to
be when they started the program. While this order did not change the
rules for the Turtles, it meant they would be trading less money now.
Instead of trading a $1 million account, they now traded that account
as if it were a $500,000 account. Essentially, they were just massively
de- leveraged.
Egos must have been bruised when those four Turtles beat Dennis
and Eckhardt at their own game. They had been trading by these rules
for years, teaching them to others, making millions, and then suddenly
their trainees proved the rules were wrong. However, even after the
cutback in their leverage, the Turtles kept performing. This was ten-
sion.
Some Turtles thought there was a certain side of Dennis that felt as
if he had created a bunch of Frankensteins (“My God, I’m competing
against the people I trained!”). To top it off, during this period the
Turtles were actually outperforming Dennis as a group.
Many Turtles thought they were doing better because t hey’d been
taught good habits. Some thought Dennis had kept bad habits from the
days when he was in the pit. Mike Shannon added, “He would not get
angry, but he’d become hyper- critical about the certain execution of
trades that would make sense if you’re standing in the pit, but really
wasn’t as hyper- relevant if you were trading off the floor. He was always
worried about ‘skid’ and we certainly were concerned about it as well.”
But for some reason, not getting great fills on his trades (what the in-
dustry calls “skid”) was an ongoing (and perhaps irrational) bone of
contention for Dennis.
For a man who taught logic and the scientific method to his stu-
dents, it was amazing to hear that he worried too much about arguably
inconsequential issues. He may have been feeling the tension when he
once wondered outloud if he had a fatal pressure point: “I really am a
contrarian at heart, and that’s really probably not good if you’re a me-
chanical trend follower.”10
Bad omen.

Game Over
“If Rich would not have traded against our positions, which I know
he did at times, he’d have made even more money.”
Anonymous Turtle from interview
In early 1988, the big political news was that the Soviet Red Army was
withdrawing from Afghanistan. In the business arena, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. had just completed their then record leveraged buyout
of RJR Nabisco (surpassed only in February 2007 by Blackstone Group’s
purchase of Equity Office). The Turtles had their own current event to
deal with when Dennis suddenly pulled the plug.
It was over. Dennis sent a fax telling the Turtles that the program
had been scuttled. Dennis, who was managing money for clients, too,
had two public funds with Michael Milken’s Drexel Burnham Lam-
bert. They closed down with big losses. The reason for the Turtle pro-
gram shutdown has never been offi cially defined, but Dennis’s
performance numbers painted a sobering picture:
The game changed for Dennis when his losses were 55 percent in
April 1988. Not only was his public fund performance beyond terrible;
his father had recently died. One Turtle attributed the program’s clo-
sure to “family issues.” They were tough times for sure. However, April
was not a terribly tough performance month for the Turtles. They typi-
cally lost 10 to 12 percent each for that month (see Appendix). Their
losses were nowhere near the size of Dennis’s losses.
That said, the shock of having the plug pulled threw the Turtles for
a loop. Jim DiMaria was bewildered at the Turtle program’s abrupt
ending: “All of a sudden it’s over. That’s how fast it was. They came in
Monday morning and said, ‘Friday, we’re done.’ I was like, ‘Oh, better
get a job.’ ” Some argued that his heavy losses forced Dennis out of the
game, but DiMaria said personal trading losses didn’t force his hand.

DiMaria said that it was Dennis’s money, and he just didn’t want to do
it anymore.1 Other Turtles said in no uncertain terms that the program
was ended as a consequence of the Drexel meltdown.
Dennis himself simply declared that he was retiring. He announced
that he would move full time into political causes. He wanted to take
the wind out of what he thought were efforts to make “liberal” a dirty
word. He quickly plunged headlong into libertarianism. To him, liber-
tarian ideals, which stressed individual rights, were a tonic for society.
However, others were not buying his political posturing. They felt the
big trading losses had pushed him into politics.
When it came to discussing his rocky trading for the Drexel funds,
Dennis laid partial blame on his clients. They did not understand
the nature of his trading style and when the drawdowns started, they
lost faith in him. He could never understand why his clients (either
now or back in the early 1980s) lacked his steely resolve. He also won-
dered why Drexel’s administrative people let him down. When they
came to see him he said, “What the hell are you doing?” As a fl oor

trader, Dennis had been down more than 50 percent a few times. He
asked Drexel, “Didn’t anyone tell these people what they were getting
into?”2
Clearly, the marketing people sold only the “good times” to the cli-
ents invested in the Dennis- managed Drexel funds. That said, Dennis
was the trader; he was the one with whom the buck stopped, not the
brokers selling him to the masses. However, the Drexel fund’s troubles
did not immediately discourage the former “Prince of the Pit.” He was
confident even at his worst moment: “What should give investors con-
fidence is the overall record I’ve compiled in my 18-year career.”3 An
eighteen-y ear track records mean little to clients when you lose 55 per-
cent in one month.
Drexel executives have proved perennially unwilling to comment
on the chain of events that led to the unraveling of Dennis’s fund back
in 1988. Former Drexel executive Richard Sandor had a good natured
response to me when I asked if he would comment on what happened;
he said “not in a million years.” Not a surprising reaction from one of
the more prominent names in Chicago trading.
However, Dennis himself was not as reticent, and he addressed his
hard times head on: “I wouldn’t trade a public fund now even if it were
a cure for cancer.”4 He was angry. He felt the risks of trading with him
were fully disclosed in printed materials, and said, “I found out the
hard way, by going through the courts that disclosure documents tend
not to mean anything. The way our court system is structured, you can
make ignorance work to your advantage, by saying, ‘I d idn’t understand
the risks and this shouldn’t have happened.’ ”5
For someone famous for being sanguine about losses, it was surpris-
ing to hear Dennis voice frustration. Many had no sympathy. He was
once the boy wonder. He was the guy w ho’d made hundreds of mil-
lions. He was the guy giving money to politicians to spread his infl u-
ence. His career competitors, those he won money from in the zero- sum
game, were not feeling his pain.
Lawsuits soon followed as his former clients in the Drexel funds ar-
gued that Dennis had deviated from his own rules. Eventually, U.S.
District Judge Milton Pollack agreed to a settlement in which nearly six
thousand investors shared $2.5 million and got half of Dennis’s trading

profits over the next three years. Under the settlement, Dennis and his
firms did not admit any wrongdoing.6
Even in the midst of losing and being understandably angry about
nonstop lawsuits, C hicago’s living legend still managed to wax philo-
sophical about what he was going through: “The sad truth is the legal
system is so porous that even reflections of things gone and settled have
liability that they shouldn’t. If I say one day I had a headache and didn’t
take an aspirin, I guess someone could call me into court for that.”
Dennis believed that at any time, the vast majority of trading results
were determined by uncontrollable factors. He felt that was the case in
this period.7
Uncontrollable? Dennis’s students did not lose 50 percent in April
1988; he did. While followers of Dennis routinely thought his Turtles
were an overly risky group because of his trading record, the Turtles’
trading strategy was not the same strategy their teacher was using. His
losses were not the result of pure trend- following trading, and there is
no way to know exactly what he was doing differently.
Larry Hite, a founding father in the hedge fund industry and some-
one at the beginning of the now multibillion- dollar British- based Man
hedge fund, wasn’t sure what Dennis was doing at the time. He said
that Dennis’s trading did not make sense, since there was no one mar-
ket move that should have caused his losses.
Like Hite, David Cheval appreciated what Dennis had been through
but questioned his decision-m aking at a time when his peers were do-
ing quite well: “The fact that Richard Dennis made a fortune from a
small opening stake is admirable. The issue is whether he followed his
system when he took public money. I believe his drawdowns and vola-
tility were far in excess of those experienced by the Turtles during the
same period. Trust me, I admire what Richard Dennis achieved. How-
ever, I do believe he is human and open to criticism.”8
Mike Shannon, who was there to witness the chaos, was alarmed
along with other Turtles at D ennis’s risk-t aking. Shannon said that the
Turtles always knew what D ennis’s positions were because of position
limits. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had
limits designed to keep any one trader from trading too much of any
one market.
However, there was another reason for the Turtles’ knowledge of



==================================================

==================================================

Game Over 133
Dennis’s trading positions: He was an open book. When Dennis was
trading the Drexel funds, Shannon said the Turtles were allowed to
trade one, possibly two, units of the S&P 500 stock index. Shannon
said Dennis was trading ten or fifteen units of S&Ps. He said the Turtles
couldn’t figure out why Dennis was overtrading when he had stressed
time and time again that overtrading would kill you: “We calculated
one day that his risk was probably one hundred times greater than the
risk we were taking.”
That Dennis was possibly taking risks over and above his Turtles by
a factor of 100 simply made no sense. He knew enough to make his
students do the right thing, but had a difficult time disciplining himself.
Both his achievements and shortcomings were in plain sight.
Amazingly, even though Dennis was losing money on his own trad-
ing decisions, his Turtle trading hedge, in the form of his students’
great performance, was keeping him in the black. How much money
did he make off of the Turtles’ trading over those four years? He did not
blink, in answering, “Tons. I think they grossed $150 million and we
made $110 million. We started out paying them ten percent. Why not?
Why give them a lot—it was our money, we took all the risk.”9
However, while Dennis was bowing out of the game, his Wall Street
fame was about to skyrocket thanks to a new book that featured top
traders ranging from Bruce Kovner to Ed Seykota to Larry Hite to Paul
Tudor Jones.
In the book Market Wizards, author Jack Schwager softened the
blow to Dennis’s tough times by entitling his chapter “A Legend Re-
tires.” Schwager’s Dennis chapter became a cult classic. He may al-
ready have been an underground legend, but this chapter minted the
Dennis legend to a whole new audience right at the rockiest time of his
career.
With his fame greater than ever, Dennis hit the speaking circuit. He
was invited to make appearances at assorted investment conferences.
Not since the 1970s had so many people wanted a piece of him. Now
that everyone had read Market Wizards, they had visions of being se-
lected for the next Turtle class—even if none were scheduled.
Charles Faulkner met Dennis around this time at a Chicago Board
of Trade conference in Chicago. He said, “When I read Dennis was
appearing on a panel moderated by Jack Schwager, I immediately

bought tickets. I had been thinking a lot about what made it hard for
traders to follow their system.”
Faulkner saw Dennis being treated like a rockstar. Would-b e Turtles
mobbed him as he left the stage. Faulkner observed that Dennis was
wary with so many people wanting something from him.
Later that evening Faulkner was introduced briefl y to Dennis.
Faulkner, a close observer of human nature, who would himself be
profiled in the second Market Wizards book, was struck by Dennis’s
appearance: “I was close enough to notice that his face had the look of
someone who was having a tough time of it and generally not taking
care of himself. This got me to wondering about what the non- academic,
not ‘hard work,’ requirements might be for successful trading. For here
was someone whose success was costing him dearly.”
Whether or not Dennis needed a break from the most tumultuous
time of his life, his Turtles had graduated. It was time to see if they
could continue to win at the game without their teacher. This would
be the real life experiment and with no Richard Dennis safety net.

Out on Their Own
“The biggest conspiracy has always been the fact that there is no
conspiracy. N obody’s out to get you. Nobody gives a shit whether
you live or die. There, you feel better now?”
Dennis Miller, comedian
Fame is a drug. It distorts perspective. The movie Trading Places, a fi re-
starter for the Turtle experiment, addresses fame when Eddie Murphy’s
character, Billy Ray Valentine, makes the transition from street hustler
to successful speculator.
Jettisoned into the lap of luxury, he is enjoying the good life, refl ect-
ing on his fortune while smoking a cigar and reading a Wall Street
Journal article about himself. Coleman, his butler, peers at him admir-
ingly and remarks how well he has done in only three weeks. Billy Ray
thinks about it: “Three weeks? Is that all? You know, I can’t even re-
member what I used to do before all this happened to me.” His butler
smiles back and says, “All you needed was a chance.1
The Turtles were also given a chance, but in a heartbeat the security
of trading Dennis’s millions was gone. One minute they were trading
for a moneymaking god and the next minute they were literally on the
Street. As it turns out, some of the Turtles foresaw job insecurity with
Dennis and were preparing their own version of C&D Commodities.
Others were on cruise control, unaware that life under Dennis’s cushy
umbrella was about to end.
Jim DiMaria regretted the ending, saying that he thought all of
the Turtles would have stayed if Dennis had kept the program going.
He said, “I would never have left. Unless they made it that I couldn’t
make money somehow.” Mike Cavallo agreed that it had been one
great gig, but also said that Dennis shut the program down ultimately



==================================================

due to problems he had incurred from the 1987 stock crash. (Dennis’s
April 1988 performance was a big reason, too.)
However, just because Dennis pulled the plug on the Turtle pro-
gram didn’t mean his students were headed back to obscurity. Instead,
they became Wall S treet’s newest rockstars. The phenomenon of
students surpassing their teacher may not have been envisioned when
Dennis created the Turtles, but it is not uncommon in other areas of
life. The ascension of assistant coaches from winning sports teams to
head coach happens all the time. Winning rubs off, and people want
a piece of winners who have associated with even bigger winners.
Clearly, if Dennis had anticipated the Turtles (as a group) would
make hundreds of millions of dollars trading for clients after working
for him, he never would have shut down the program. Yet how could
he have known that once his students were out of school, Turtle-m ania
would hit? Maybe he should have known. Other trend- following trad-
ers were doing well at the time. They were raising millions to trade,
without the snap, crackle, pop of the Turtle story.
In fact the Turtles as a group, along with Michael O’Brien, who had
long raised client money for Dennis to trade, saw an opportunity in the
whole being greater than the sum of its parts. The Turtles were going
to use O’Brien as a broker to set up a Turtle fund. They met to discuss
trading as a group, but could not agree on the split. Egos were on full
display.
Mike Shannon said that since they were probably “the best traders
on the planet at the time,” it all went to the heads of some Turtles.
Some thought they were better than others. However, the Turtles’ per-
formance numbers while working for Dennis did not show great perfor-
mance differences on average.
That said, while most of the Turtles were confused about what to
do next, one of them clearly saw the writing on the wall. Jerry Parker
went back to Virginia to start figuring out a trading business on his
own. One Turtle thought Parker was a “traitor” for going solo so fast
when a Turtle fund idea was on the table. But the name of the game
was survival.
Parker’s desire to go at it alone was the final demise of any effort to
create a single Turtle fund. The collective disappointment could be

heard in one Turtle’s resigned tone: “It never worked out. It should
have; it would have been one of the greatest superfunds in history.”
Quickly, most of the Turtles filed with the government to trade for
clients. Anthony Bruck, Michael Carr, Michael Cavallo, Elizabeth
Cheval, Sam DeNardo, Jim DiMaria, Jeff Gordon, Erle Keefer, Philip
Lu, Stig Ostgaard, Jerry Parker, Brian Proctor, Paul Rabar, Russell
Sands, Howard Seidler, Tom Shanks, Michael Shannon, and Craig
Soderquist all had dreams of running the next C&D Commodities.
Curtis Faith did not continue trading, saying that he was now retired at
twenty-three.
Tu rtles in The Market Wizards
While the idea of a group Turtle fund died a quick death, Turtle fame
on Wall Street began rolling. When Jack Schwager wrote The Market
Wizards (1989) and its follow- up, The New Market Wizards (1992), his
chapters on Richard Dennis and the Turtles made the Turtle experi-
ment accessible to many for the fi rst time.
However, Schwager’s Turtle chapter ended up being about the fact
that the Turtles kept saying, “No comment.” He even titled it “Silence
of the Turtles” because they all refused to talk substance with him.
Nondisclosure agreements were one reason why the Turtles wouldn’t
talk, but another just as significant reason was that they were afraid too
much publicity about their techniques would hurt their returns. Just the
opposite happened. Their protective stance of “no comment” created
an aura of mystery, even if this was unintended. It seemed that everyone
who had heard of the Turtles wanted some of their money managed
by them. The time was right to capitalize on their good fortune.
They all pursued that good fortune in different ways. Paul Rabar said
the key was to get to Wall Street as soon as possible so they knew the
Turtles after Dennis were alive, so to speak. Jerry Parker, however,
stayed far away from Wall Street, heading to Richmond, Virginia, to
explore ventures with Russell Sands. Sands had been trading in Kidder
Peabody’s Richmond office. It was a good place to be, as Kidder had
access to clients interested in traders like Sands and Parker. One Turtle
remarked about Kidder Peabody’s operations there, “It was two guys



==================================================

sitting down there traveling around the world trying to raise Middle
East money to trade. They had office space down there that they had
given to Sands and he had been trading their money.”
Most Turtles, however, were essentially one-m an road shows. For
example, when Paul Rabar first started out, people who wanted to in-
vest with him would ask how he traded. Rabar said that if they wanted
to invest, they could give him their money. Period. No questions asked.
Potential investors would have to meet him at the airport. Some inves-
tors probably walked away from what could be perceived as his arro-
gance, but without a doubt, many were smitten by R abar’s “take it or
leave it” attitude. There is a fine line between confidence and arro-
gance, and Rabar walked it with great success.
Russell Sands and Jerry Parker initially walked that fine line to-
gether. Sands, in a classic small-w orld story, knew Kidder Peabody
broker Kevin Brandt from college at NYU. Parker called Sands to ask
if he would introduce him to some Wall Street people (read: brokers
to help raise money to trade). Since the two guys at Kidder Peabody
in Richmond were Sands’s friends, he quickly introduced Parker.
Sands added, “The guys at Kidder Peabody basically looked at Jerry
when they met him and they looked at me and said, ‘You guys will
make a pretty good team together. If you [set up a firm], we’ll give you
some seed money to get started.’ That’s how Chesapeake Capital got
started.”
Making Dennis’s Rules Less “Risky”
With the skids greased by Jack Schwager and the Wall Street Journal,
all the Turtles should have been able to land on their feet. Yet one of
the decisions each Turtle had to make was whether to trade at the level
of risk they had been taught by Dennis or dial it back to make it more
palatable for clients (go look at the volatility of the Turtle month- by-
month numbers again in the Appendix). They had all just witnessed
Dennis’s Drexel blowup, so theirs was rightful concern.
Jerry Parker, it turns out, was the first Turtle who figured out the
importance of using less leverage to appeal to investors, saying,
“The bigger the trade the greater the returns and the greater the draw-
downs. It’s a double-e dged sword.”2 At the same time, the Turtle ad-



==================================================

==================================================

venture was the learning experience that pushed Parker to reassess
leverage choices:
I lost 60% in one day, although we were still up 140% at the end
of the day. I was probably managing $2 million when the program
ended in 1988. When I started Chesapeake, I was sure it was not
a good idea to lose 60% in one day. So I compromised on my risk,
traded smaller, and tried for 20% a year.3
Using a ton of leverage (even if it was well thought out) was the rea-
son for huge swings in the Turtles’ performance. Parker said, “We were
nuts. And then later in the mid 1980s and 1990s, we said, ‘okay, let’s
make �15%, �20%’ and we raised a billion dollars.’ If you’re going
to raise a lot of money, people will be very happy with �15% or
�20%.”4
Others in the hedge fund industry were on the same page with
Parker’s view on leverage. Paul Tudor Jones (not a Turtle), for example,
does not think he is a different trader today—except for reducing lever-
age. His returns have dropped since the 1980s, but his risk- adjusted
returns are the same as in his early days. He said, “What’s different has
been my own personal appetite for risk and volatility. I think that prob-
ably happens with a lot of people, as they get older. Everything is a
function of leverage, how much of a drawdown are you willing to toler-
ate, how much leverage do you want to put on. When I was younger, I
had much greater drawdowns, much greater drawdown frequency,
much greater leverage.” (Side note: Jones got into trading after reading
an article on Richard Dennis in college; he recalled, “I thought that
Dennis had the greatest job in the world.”)
Parker simply used Dennis’s trading system in a way that was more
appropriate for nervous clients. Not all clients always want the early
Turtle- trading absolute returns, the big home runs. In general, high
returns do not attract as much money from investors as lower-v olatility
trading (which means less return).
Not surprisingly, Parker’s efforts to change how he traded had an
impact on other Turtles. Once big institutional investors looking to
invest with a former Turtle had Parker, they d idn’t really need more
Turtles—that is, unless they offered something different than Parker.



==================================================
                     PAGE 156                     
==================================================

140 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
With Parker covering that piece of many investors’ portfolios, the other
Turtles had to try and push their individual differences. The problem
was that their performance numbers under Dennis showed a near iden-
tical group of traders. Many investors thought the Turtles all sat in a
room and when a green light went off, they all bought Swiss francs.5
For Turtles looking to stand out on their own, this was not a good char-
acterization to be making the rounds.
That did not stop the Turtles from trying to distinguish their trading.
Michael Carr said that he was now prone to lighten up or take a por-
tion of the profi ts.6 But it was more than just their style that the Turtles
wanted to differentiate. Stig Ostgaard, in an effort to gain some dis-
tance from Dennis, said he traded on behalf of a well- known Chicago
commodity trader in the Turtle program.7 In a stark demonstration of
the Turtles’ ambivalence Ostgaard wanted to have Dennis on his ré-
sumé without having to name him.
DiMaria also distanced himself from Dennis, saying that clients did
not want 150 percent returns and double- digit negative months.8 The
challenges for all of the Turtles, in starting their own version of C&D
Commodities, were tough. The industry simply did not want Richard
Dennis–type volatility.9
This is not suprising. The industry is made up of institutional bean
counters managing billions upon billions in pension plans. They don’t
want higher- volatility or higher- return trading. There is no immediate
benefit for them even, if it might be the optimal strategy for their pen-
sioners in the long run. Why? Pension fund managers judge themselves
by targeting benchmarks. They only worry about aggregate measures of
what their peers are doing, which is by and large trading “long” only.
With that mandate, Turtle returns are useless.
Even if it was arguably a bad long-t erm move to cater to clients’
desires for less leverage, there was only so much Turtles could do. If
a client says, “I want this” and Turtles say, “I w on’t trade that way, it
hurts compounding,” they will not have that client. It was a classic
Catch- 22.
Parker got it. He was quite willing to compromise the original rules,
which was after all was making him super- rich in the early 1990s. But
while, the idea of lowering returns by reducing leverage in the hope of



==================================================
                     PAGE 157                     
==================================================

Out on Their Own 141
reducing drawdown may have been a winning move for Parker, it w asn’t
for all the Turtles.
In fact, it may have contributed to their downfall. The very nature of
what the Turtles had been taught revolved around taking large calcu-
lated risks. Reducing the risk level quickly reduced the size of potential
returns. In the trading business, big returns are critical. The basics of
compounding are always at play. If Turtles were cutting their appetite
for risk in year one, they left little or no cushion if their next y ear’s per-
formance bombed.10
However, many of Parker’s Turtle compatriots were not ready to give
up the original high- risk style they were taught. Those Turtles never
stopped seeing the benefits to the home- run approach Dennis had
taught them.
Sticking to Their Knitting
Unlike Parker and Rabar, Tom Shanks did not pull back from the orig-
inal aggressive Turtle rules. From his then home office overlooking the
Sonoma Valley in California, he was blunt: “There are individual in-
vestors who seek high returns and are willing to accept the risk entailed
in achieving them.”11
However, most investors did not want S hanks’s Turtles style even
though he would eventually knock the cover off the ball. Other Turtles
saw Shanks as Mickey Mantle. “He will hit the ball out of the park. It’s
just you have to stay with him. Unfortunately, money is being con-
trolled by people who don’t know the business. They couldn’t trade
their way out of a paper bag if their life depended on it.”
This criticism of people ignoring high- return traders was spot on,
but being right does not mean Shanks was on the way to being Parker
wealthy. One Turtle could not figure out how an investment with
Shanks could not be a small percentage of everyone’s portfolio, saying,
“If you . . . saw gold go from $350 an ounce to $600 an ounce, you
want to be with Tom, because . . . you’re going to make a lot more
money with someone like him.”
This was the original Turtle trading mentality, but it goes straight
against people’s natural inclinations. Of course, Dennis had taught the



==================================================
                     PAGE 158                     
==================================================

142 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
Turtles that natural inclinations are almost always wrong when it comes
to making the right market decisions.12
Shanks did his best to differentiate himself from other Turtles by
declaring at one point that his trading had shifted to 75 percent system-
atic and 25 percent discretionary.13 For some investors, the idea that a
mechanical “black box” trading system, with trades placed from code
executed inside a computer, is foreign. Shanks used the word “discre-
tion” to allay those fears. He wanted to show that he added value to his
trading system beyond the hard and fast rules. However, Shanks’s use of
discretion almost sank his firm in the mid- 1990s before he recovered,
acknowledging the mistake.
He was not the only Turtle to stick with Dennis’s high-r isk, high-
return style. Liz Cheval was clear: “I felt that people who invested
based on my track record deserved the same trading program that pro-
duced those results.”14 She added, “Volatility is what creates the high
returns investors want from the market in the first place. As always,
when assuming risk, investors should look for commensurate rewards.
And high rewards don’t come without high volatility.”15 Cheval openly
admitted that she adjusted the size of her trading positions using
Dennis’s model for volatility.16
With the passing of years, and with the time to reflect on the wisdom
of Parker’s less leveraged approach versus Shanks and Cheval’s high-
octane approach, the market of nervous institutional investors made a
choice. It liked Parker’s choice and frowned on any allegiance to the
original Turtle style.
Highly Correlated Traders
However they positioned themselves, whether as less or more risky than
their mentor, the Turtles as individuals were the same traders in the
eyes of Wall Street insiders. Their trading performance was highly cor-
related, which meant there was a historical tendency for their perfor-
mance to move in tandem.17 Numerous correlation comparisons
showed the Turtles trading the same way.18
However, it was Tom Shanks’s opinion that the Turtles had evolved
and developed systems very different from those taught under Dennis.
He said, “Independent evolution suggests that the dissimilarities in

trading between Turtles are always increasing.”19 Shanks’s opinion
seemed designed to camouflage the fact that the Turtles were all really
competitors.20
This spin did not convince old pros on Wall Street. Virginia Parker
(unrelated to Jerry Parker), a fund management consultant, saw no
mystery in the Turtles, as well she knew that they are all driven by sys-
tematic, momentum- based, trend- following models.21
Mark Goodman, president of Kenmar Asset Allocation, a fi rm that
invested with the likes of the Turtles, said what none of them wanted to
hear: “If you were to put all trend- following models side by side, you
would probably find that most made their profits and incurred losses in
the same markets. You are not going to find that EMC [Liz Cheval]
made it in one market, while Rabar made it in another. They were all
looking at the same charts and obtaining the same perception of op-
portunity.”22
Whether dealing with initial fame, trading as a less or more risky
Turtle, or battling correlation perceptions or negative associations with
Dennis, the pressure was on. If there were potentially jealousies inside
the program, imagine the feelings of rivalry building up now with the
Jerry Parkers of the world fast approaching a net worth of over $100
million in the early to mid- 1990s.
Perhaps the Turtle story would have ended right there. They had all
been part of a grand experiment. They all learned to trade well while
under Dennis. It had been a good ride. But here is where Turtles sepa-
rated. Beyond the rules, they still needed something else for long- term
trading success.

Dennis Comes Back to the Game
“He was the toughest son of a bitch I ever knew. He taught me
that trading is very competitive and you have to be able to handle
getting your butt kicked. No matter how you cut it, there are
enormous emotional ups and downs involved.”
Paul Tudor Jones,
hedge fund manager, on his mentor Eli Tullis
Whether the Turtles became big winners or losers, the excitement of
their fame and money had their former teacher wanting a piece of the
early 1990s money pouring into hedge funds. The Turtles’ success was
100 percent because of him, but now his students were ahead. To trade
or not to trade was Dennis’s internal debate as he pondered reentry into
a now more crowded field to compete against his apprentices.1
However, the early to mid- 1990s was a tough time for Dennis. He
was still unhappy about a class action suit brought against him after
the Drexel fund debacle. Plaintiffs chasing him through the courts
concluded he was “financially strapped” and “debt-r idden.”2 Dennis
poverty- stricken? Doubtful. Was Dennis envious of his students’ suc-
cess? He essentially said so.
Jeff Gordon attempted to get into Dennis’s head: “Rich thought he
could out- trade his own methodology. How in the world could a meth-
odology that you created with your own knowledge out- trade you?”
Yet Gordon, like so many others who were acquainted with Dennis’s
1988 “retirement” and shutdown of the Turtle program, was not sym-
pathetic. He was perplexed. He kept wondering about what could have
been: “Let’s just say, you taught a bunch of beginners to play chess,
then you start playing them and they all start [beating] you. How would
you feel? If Richard Dennis had hung up his cleats and just allowed the
Turtle program to manage all that money he got from Drexel, they

might have $10 billion now. He could be sitting on easy street. We will
never know how many hundreds of millions and perhaps how many
billions of dollars he might have left on the table because he disbanded
the Turtle group.”
Dennis must have felt that he had left money on the table, too, be-
cause in 1994, along with his brother Tom, he launched a new fi rm
called Dennis Trading Group. No fanfare; just an unlisted phone num-
ber and suite number on the door to protect anonymity.
This was not the mammoth operation of C&D in the 1980s (one
hundred employees, fifty to one hundred customers, and $8 million in
fixed costs), but Dennis still had loyal supporters. “He is a lifelong stu-
dent of the markets and a brilliant individual. Anything he does is worth
paying close attention to,” said Sol Waksman of Barclay Trading Group,
a consulting firm that tracks fund performance.3
While he had taken to calling himself a “researcher” now instead of
a “trader,” one of the questions Dennis was asked most frequently was,
“Why are you doing this? Why step back into the fire again?” Dennis
gave all kinds of answers from philanthropy to politics, but when
pressed, he came back to his famous students: “I kept picking up the
trade journals and seeing how much money they were managing. I
thought, ‘I know I’m at least as good as some of these people.’ So I de-
cided to give it another try.”4
Still, there were reservations about this comeback. Vic Lespinasse, a
floor analyst at the Chicago Board of Trade, saw the pros and cons: “He
still has a very good reputation, although it has been tarnished some-
what by the Drexel episode. He’s going to have to establish a track re-
cord again, but I don’t see why he shouldn’t do that. I think he’s a
superstar.”5
When Dennis was asked to compare his new firm’s trading strategy
to the Turtles, he sounded less confident than in years past: “The peo-
ple I trained [Turtles] are succeeding on the ideas they learned from
me. People might be interested in getting some updated ideas. If yester-
day’s motto was that the trend is our friend, today it might be that the
trend is a harsh mistress.”6
Just as the Turtles were trying to overcome identity issues on Wall
Street and Dennis was staging his comeback, Turtle Russell Sands
threw everyone a curve ball.

Russell Sands
Russell Sands lasted one year as a Turtle before leaving for reasons that
aren’t completely clear. While he said that he resigned, other Turtles
said he was “let go.” However, that detail was minor in view of Sands’s
true Turtle legacy: selling Dennis’s famous rules.
The selling of Dennis’s rules followed shortly after Sands’s departure
from Chesapeake Capital (the firm he’d created with Jerry Parker).
Sands was always honest about why Parker carried more weight in their
former firm (“he had the longer and more valid track record”), but at
the same time tension was brewing.
For a while they had a close relationship. Every day they were at
each other’s house. However, Parker soon bought Sands out. What was
Sands’s version of the buyout? “Jerry got greedy.” In all fairness, many
hard-w orking people who make millions are called greedy. Sands could
have just as easily been called jealous.
Sands had an explanation for why trading had not gone his way
after parting with Parker: “Paul Saunders and Kevin Brandt [Kidder
Peabody/James River Capital Principles] came to me and said, ‘Rus-
sell, why don’t you start your own company? We’ll give you some
money and let Jerry have Chesapeake.’ I said fine. This was right after
the first Gulf War, when there had been some huge moves in the oil
markets.”
Kidder Peabody gave Sands money to trade, but the markets did not
produce good trends over the next six to nine months. Sands said his
trading performance went down to around 25 percent. His clients all
ran for the doors. He sounded boxed in explaining his predicament:
“Now, I’m basically out of business and don’t know what to do next.”
In August 1992, a few days after Hurricane Andrew had rocked south
Florida, Sands rocked the Turtles’ carefully crafted secrecy. The Chi-
cago Tribune blasted the story:
A disciple of Richard J. Dennis, the world- famous Chicago fu-
tures trader, is offering to reveal the master’s trading secrets to the
public for the first time . . . promising to tell all at seminars across
the country, including one this weekend in Chicago, for an ad-
mission fee of $2,500 a person.7

==================================================

Maybe Sands selling Dennis’s rules would have been no big deal in
a normal situation, but the secrecy in the Turtles’ world was intense.
Mike Shannon laughed at the situation in hindsight: “If we were hav-
ing this interview and it was 1986 or 1987, we wouldn’t be talking. We
were very guarded about the whole thing and we were intensely proud
of what we were back in the day. We felt that there was something
really incredibly special going on, that we were part of a special and
experimental project. The secrecy alone was just off the charts. We
weren’t allowed to discuss it according to Richard or anybody that
worked for him.”
However, Jim DiMaria downplayed the need for even signing an
agreement: “It was pretty obvious to me that this stuff should be kept
secret . . . the stuff we were taught was their stuff. I was lucky enough
that they shared it with me. I didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone
else.”
DiMaria’s response was typical of how most Turtles felt toward Den-
nis. After all, the Turtle experiment was all about making big- time
money, and sharing rules for making millions made no sense. So not
knowing what the impact of S ands’s actions would be, the other Turtles
attempted to minimize the importance of Dennis’s rules. They wanted
the world to know that the rules alone w eren’t the secret to riches (true
point).
As a counterstrike, Sands argued that it was a good business opportu-
nity: “I d idn’t do anything illegal. I d idn’t even do anything immoral. I
tell people, ‘Whatever I say is what Richard Dennis said twenty years
ago.’ I give him all the credit in the world for it. I didn’t come up with
these ideas. I’m just passing it on. That’s the way it is.”
Fifteen years before he was the arguable billionaire he is today, Jerry
Parker reacted with outrage against his former partner: “I don’t think
Russell has anything to say that’s worth $2,500.”8 Given that Sands and
Parker had been co- workers and friends at one time, his comment was
a ninety- five- mile- per- hour fastball at Sands’s head.
Liz Cheval then played the “Sands only learned so much” card, say-
ing that it took her about two years to fully grasp and then use Dennis’s
rules.9 Other Turtles said that since Sands was terminated from the
program after one year, he did not get the “real” system.10

Right. Parker and Sands had worked in the same house every day. At
that time, Sands knew what Parker knew about the Turtle trading rules.
Both shared the same basic knowledge back then. The “doing” part,
the reason Parker is huge today, is a whole other story.
Sam DeNardo pulled back the curtain on Sands: “I think he [Sands]
was talking to people outside the room about what he was doing. That
got him in a lot of trouble. I heard it with my own ears. There was some
talk that he was talking to either his mother or somebody about differ-
ent trades. The word got back to Rich. And I don’t know if it was that
or his performance that got him cut from the program. He ultimately
got cut.” Multiple Turtles gave the same basic story.
Sands said he was not fi red, but chose to resign. He said, “I’m sure
some of them say I quit. I’m sure some of them say I was fi red. I’m
sure some of them say I had a big mouth and said things I shouldn’t
have said.”
On the other hand the leaflet for S ands’s 1992 seminars said he’d
co-m anaged funds with Parker. Parker, said in most cases that Sands
merely placed orders at his direction. He thought S ands’s prime mo-
tivation for selling the rules was to raise money and get back into
trading.11
Parker thought S ands’s actions violated Dennis’s training not in a
legal way, but in a moral and ethical one. He said of Dennis, “How
could we repay him for giving us all this knowledge?”12 Parker added,
“Rich always said that you can’t pay attention to books, articles or pa-
pers. If it was worth knowing, the people would keep it for themselves
and trade.”13
In the end, maybe Sands had simply embarrassed his Turtle peers so
much that they felt they had to respond. The promotional language
Sands and his marketing people used to sell the Turtle rules promised:
“The Most Powerful, Valuable and Profitable Trading Method Ev-
er . . . Now Revealed in a New Trading Course for Just a Small, No-
Risk Investment!” Sands’s ads screamed about “A Very Affordable Low,
Low Price! 15 straight years of Profi table Trading!”
Playing right into the attacks against him, Sands’s marketing pitched,
“Listen, there are a lot of people very upset that Russell is sharing these
secrets, especially at such a low price. The other original Turtles and



==================================================

their phenomenally successful mentor do not want these priceless se-
crets revealed. At any price!” It was like a 2007 late- night infomercial
from Wizetrade, 4x Made Easy, or INVESTools.
Eventually, DeNardo offered a more sympathetic interpretation of
Sands’s teaching: “Everybody else is sort of mad at him for letting the
system out of the bag. What else was he supposed to do? Drive a cab?”
Erle Keefer gave another reason for the secrecy at any cost: “Honestly,
I don’t think we were that sophisticated. I just think there was . . . alle-
giance to Rich.”
Dennis’s own take on the selling of rules was tight- lipped. He made
it clear, however, that a few Turtles had failed: “There were one or two
[Turtles] who will remain nameless. The majority was exemplary.”14
He may have been diplomatic, but his longtime friend and fellow
trader Tom Willis, who was and is no fan of Sands, was not: “I’ve always
thought that Rich exemplifies the Christian attitude and behavior
more than most Christians I know. He probably doesn’t hold a grudge
against Russell.”
Dennis Retires Again
Soon after the Sands dustup, Dennis staged another remarkable come-
back. It would take him through most of the 1990s. While Dennis did
not reveal his exact trading systems to the public, his performance data
had earmarks of trend- following trading. After returning in 1994, his
compounded annual rate of return was approximately plus 63 percent
through September 1998. For two years in a row, 1995 (108.9%) and
1996 (112.7%), Dennis had triple- digit returns.15
He was still the same high-r isk, high-r eward trader he had always
been. It was his ticket to the Hall of Fame and his Achilles’ heel rolled
into one. However, this was now the time of Bill Clinton and the dot-
com bubble. It was hard to get noticed even with his great perfor-
mance.
On top of that, many investors were gun- shy about another Dennis
comeback. In an effort to allay client fears, he assured everyone that
his infamous discretion, his inability to not personally interfere with his
own rules, had been eliminated. He said the computer was his new
friend: “Given what the computer can do today—compared with what



==================================================
                     PAGE 167                     
==================================================

Dennis Comes Back to the Game 151
it could do only a few years ago, I just can’t see how any human could
possibly compete on a level field with a well- designed computerized
set of systems.”16
The term “computer” as a marketing hook was old news. In some
ways, Dennis was a technophobe in the middle of the Internet revolu-
tion (he always said he could not program). Maybe the over- sixty crowd
bought in, but no one else on Wall Street breathed a huge sigh of relief
just because he’d used the word “computer.”17
Worse yet, D ennis’s critics thought that his strict mechanical trading
formula was just a marketing ploy. Dennis rebutted them by saying he
had put in checks and balances. He struck a confident tone: “At the
end of the day, a trader has to go with what works. I know that me-
chanical systems work best, and therefore I am quite comfortable that
our strategies will continue to be successful.”18
There was a difference in Dennis’s trading strategy this time around:
He was religiously applying that same discipline he had taught his stu-
dents. For example, he was right there in August of 1998 making big
money during one of the most historic months on Wall Street. He, like
all trend followers, made a fortune in August. “Between the ruble, Yelt-
sin, and the deep blue sea, it’s been pretty crazy,” said Dennis with a
hint of glee. He was up 13.5 percent in August 1998, giving him a year-
to- date return of about 45 percent.19
Other traders were sinking like stones in the zero- sum market game
at the same moment Dennis was flying high. Wall S treet’s darling,
Long Term Capital Management’s (LTCM), for example, imploded at
the same time. LTCM lost billions. Chief Executive John W. Meri-
wether, the legendary former Salomon Brothers bond trader, said in a
letter to investors at the time, “August (1998) was very painful for all of
us.”20 LTCM and its two Nobel laureates, Robert H. Merton and My-
ron S. Scholes, padded the pockets of Dennis and other trend- following
traders, including the Turtles.
It was a high point for Dennis’s trading return, because within a few
years of that historic zero- sum win, he was out of the game again. On
September 29, 2000, Dennis Trading Group ceased trading and liqui-
dated customer accounts. Burt Kozloff, an investor in Dennis’s current
fund, laid out the painful truth: “Dennis Trading Group was �50%
down in June but then made a slight recovery in July. But we fi nally



==================================================
                     PAGE 168

broke through the �50% mark to �52%. You still can trade and try to
recover when you’re down 50%, but you run the risk of falling to �60%
or �70%, and there’s no turning back from there.”21
While it was no solace for Richard Dennis, the moment when cli-
ents pulled funds from him in the fall of 2000 was a bottom for trend-
following traders. In the following twelve months, returns for many of
his trading peers zoomed up 100 percent or more in performance.
Dennis’s clients had panicked at the bottom and paid dearly.
Dennis was once again out of public money management. Mean-
while, his conservative Republican student Jerry Parker was rising even
farther to the top in both the trading and political worlds. His story
would take the Turtles and their philosophy to a whole new level.

Seizing Opportunity
“A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan
next week.”
General George S. Patton
Imagine driving to Manakin- Sabot, outside of Richmond, Virginia, to
see Jerry Parker’s office in 1994. The last thing you would have antici-
pated was an unassuming colonial- style brick and wood building that
looked as though it might house a local insurance company or real-
estate office. It was situated in a field along a country road. Describing
my feeling, upon seeing it, as thunderstruck would be an understate-
ment.
Actually entering Parker’s office was like walking into the old, musty
office of your neighborhood attorney who at seventy was about to retire.
The front- office staff was friendly, unpretentious, and informal.
In contrast to that original office, Parker’s new office (opened in
1995, approximately ten miles away) has a far more gracious feeling of
Southern gentility and success. From the entrance, two staircases spiral
up each side of the room to a top landing area. However, today visitors
can no longer stroll in unannounced. Smoked- glass windows, video
cameras, and a request for identification are not surprising precautions
in today’s security- conscious society.
What remains true to Parker’s down- to-e arth character is that his
current office is located across from a 1960s- style strip mall that in-
cludes a salon, Mary Lou and Co: Hair, Nails & Wigs. Soccer moms
park in the Chesapeake Capital parking lot to pick up their children at
the church- run preschool next door. A Turtle is making a fortune in
suburban Richmond, and no one is paying attention.
Moreover, one would never guess the financial disparity between
Parker and other Turtles from the furnishings of his private office. It is



==================================================

nondescript, almost utilitarian except for a small turtle on his desk. Yet
the gap between him and his former partner Sands is arguably now a
billion dollars in net worth. The reasons for that are arguably more
important to understand than the rules originally taught the Turtles.
The bottom line is that Jerry Parker, Liz Cheval, Tom Shanks, How-
ard Seidler, Jim DiMaria, Paul Rabar, and their teacher Bill Eckhardt
had entrepreneurial skills beyond trading Dennis’s rules. They had
something extra. The people who excel in any field are people who
realize that the moment is to be seized, that there are opportunities at
every turn. They’re more alive to the moment.1
Did Dennis think that in the long run all of his students would be
alive to the moment? Back in 1986, long before the Turtles were out on
their own, he was asked how he would have reacted to his ad. He re-
sponded, “I guess I would’ve applied. I have no doubt that for the people
who got the job it was the best job that has ever come along for them.
Obviously, not all 14 are going to be the greatest traders who ever lived,
but I think there are two or three who could be really excellent.”2
R. Jerry Parker, Jr., became excellent. A graduate of Ferrum College
and the University of Virginia, he is a devoted Christian and family
man, who along with his wife home- schooled their three children.
Even though he is comparatively straight- laced, Parker still makes
time to kick back and enjoy life, especially sports. He made sure he
got good seats at Chicago Bulls games when they were winning cham-
pionships with Michael Jordan. Today, he still cheers on his University
of Virginia Cavaliers basketball team at the new John Paul Jones arena
in Charlottesville.
Parker was certainly not considered the success he is today while
working for Dennis. He ended his first year trading as a Turtle down
10 percent before regrouping to have three stellar years. But keep in
mind that he did not make the most money while working for Dennis,
in large part due to Dennis’s allotment of allocations, not his perfor-
mance. Parker may have had some regrets about the way his mentor
parceled out money, but those years under Dennis were central to his
development.
The confidence he gained while trading for Dennis was his biggest
lesson: “The most important experience that led me to utilize a techni-
cal approach was the amount of success that I experienced trading Rich’s



==================================================
                     PAGE 171                     
==================================================

Seizing Opportunity 155
system.”3 What was the critical experience he gained under Dennis? “It’s
important to live with someone who says, ‘It’s okay to lose money.’ ”
Tom Shanks agreed wholeheartedly with Parker about the need for
a mentor: “By far, the structure of what I do is based on Richard’s sys-
tems, and certainly, philosophically, everything I do in terms of trading
is based on what I learned from Richard.”4
Parker and Dennis are still political opposites. Today, Parker is one
of the most influential backers of Republican candidates in the state of
Virginia. He has contributed over $500,000 to mostly conservative can-
didates since 1995. While he has ruled out a run for political offi ce so
far, his wealth and political power put him on the short list of potential
Virginia governors.
Aspects of Parker’s politics have universal appeal. He has said, “When
there is a tax increase and the result is a surplus, the taxpayers should
receive their money back. Just as when you pay too much for some-
thing in a store, you get your change back.”5
Bottom line, Parker’s earnings from 1988 through 2006 are the clear-
est demonstration yet that the story of the Turtles is relevant today. Us-
ing his publicly available disclosures and the size of his fund, and
assuming a standard fee structure, the best educated guess of Parker’s
net worth is approximately $770 million.

That number assumes no reinvesting for twenty years. If 10 percent
growth is assumed and compounded annually, Parker’s net worth could
be as high as $1.75 billion.
What Separated Parker from Other Turtles?
“You had to be really smart to be hired by Dennis.” It might be comfort-
ing to think that intelligence alone accounted for the Turtles’ trading
success, but that would be an excuse. That said, many of the Turtles
were brilliant. So there is no intention here to slight their individual
brainpower.
However, a high IQ is hardly the key to success in life, or Enron’s
hundreds of MBAs from the top schools in the country might have
prevented its demise.6 Intelligence ensures absolutely nothing in the
long run; success requires something more.
As it turns out, most CEOs at the biggest corporations didn’t attend
Ivy League schools. They went to state universities, big and small, or to
lesser-k nown private colleges. Most people, would guess that the per-
centage of CEOs bearing Ivy League undergraduate degrees is far
higher than the actual figure of only 10 percent.7 So what, beyond pure
intelligence, enabled Parker’s twenty years of great performance?
The Maginot line, between those Turtles who achieved huge trad-
ing success after working for Dennis and those who failed at trading,
came down to an understanding and application of entrepreneurial
skills. The Turtles had to have trading rules, but without entrepreneur-
ial savvy they were doomed. Nancy Upton and Don Sexton, professors
at Baylor University who have long studied entrepreneurs, pinpointed
traits possessed by Parker and other entrepreneurs:
1. Nonconformists—lower need to conform indicating self -
reliance.
2. Emotionally aloof—not necessarily cold to others, but can be
oblivious.
3. Sky divers—lower concern for physical harm, but does change
with age.

==================================================

Seizing Opportunity 157
4. Risk takers—more comfortable taking it.
5. Socially adroit—more persuasive.
6. Autonomous—higher need for independence.
7. Change seekers—like novel approaches. This is different than
99% of all other people.
8. Energetic—higher need and / or ability to work longer.
9. Self- sufficient—don’t need as much sympathy or reassurance,
but they still need to form networks so self-s ufficiency need not
be taken to extremes.8
We shouldn’t underestimate those nine factors. Dennis turned on
the lights and supplied the brokers, the money, and the system. With
Dennis out of the picture, the Turtles had to answer for themselves as
to whether or not they had the ability and the desire to succeed on their
own. Their dilemma, whether they knew it or not at the time, could be
solved by how well they applied only those nine traits.
Jerry Parker applied the nine traits out of the gate, which some Tur-
tles proved unable or unwilling to do. Parker always had the self-
confidence to believe that one day his earnings could rival those of
Dennis. Other Turtles, when seeing firsthand Dennis earn $80 million
in 1986, may have thought, “That could never be me.” A few confessed
that they just felt lucky to be a Turtle, and when describing their peers
some used words like “timid” or “gun shy.”
No one ever described Parker like that. Although he didn’t say so
directly, he was referencing those nine characteristics of an entre-
preneur when he spoke about what it really takes to be a success. He
said, “We’re not really interested in people who are experts at the
French stock markets or German bond markets. It d oesn’t take a
huge monster infrastructure—not Harvard MBAs and people from
Goldman Sachs.”
Loren Pope, author of Colleges that Change Lives, a book extolling
the virtues of small liberal- arts colleges, appreciated the deeper mean-
ing in Parker’s wisdom: “The Ivies and other A- league schools have a



==================================================

lot of prestige because they’re supposed to open doors and lead to suc-
cessful careers. But parents who expect the Ivies to ensure their kids’
success are going to be disappointed. The old- boy network i sn’t much
good in an economy like this. It’s competence that counts.”9
Competence is not easy to acquire. Parker saw life as a Turtle as
pretty easy by comparison to his solo operation. He recalled, “Trading
for Rich, you got in at 7 a.m. and at 2 p.m. you watched the Cubs
game.” But once he became a money manager for clients he had to
raise money, hire people, do research, track his performance, and
trade. “The degree to which you are successful will be partly because
of your buys and sells. But you’re also running a business: hiring, mak-
ing sure you have good accounting and legal and marketing systems in
place.”10
Parker’s business acumen came from many sources beyond Dennis.
His favorite book, for example, is Selling the Invisible, a modern- day
marketing bible. But Parker always brought it back to his training un-
der Dennis: “An honest, humble mentor is the best thing going. Learn
from other people. Do the right thing every day, focus on what you’re
doing, and let the cards fall where they may.”11
After the Turtle program ended, Jim DiMaria had no doubts about
the cards falling right for Parker: “Jerry wanted to raise a lot of money.
He said it from day one.”
Decide What You Really Want
Following the Market Wizards books, many Turtles were content to
bask in their fame without making the true effort needed to build a
solid business. Parker’s goal was not to be on the front cover of maga-
zines (although he did once appear on the cover of Financial Trader in
1994, leaning against the white picket fence surrounding his suburban
Richmond estate). No, what he wanted was “Master of the Universe”
profi ts.
Jonathan Craven was the second person hired at Chesapeake Capi-
tal. Today, Craven runs his own trading firm with $20 million under
management. He never forgot Parker’s core principles. Parker said,
“You have to have faith in two things.” When Craven asked, “What’s
that?” Parker said, “God and your system.” Craven added, “You have to

Seizing Opportunity 159
have faith that your system works. Otherwise, you would get one hour
of sleep a night.”
What was Craven getting at? Many people think the Jerry Parkers of
the world have systems or rules that limit them to certain markets.
Upon learning of a trader like Parker, they naively assume he trades
only commodities. The reality is that Parker applies D ennis’s philoso-
phy to all markets. He seeks to apply Dennis’s original principles glob-
ally in markets all around the world. He doesn’t care what market:
Chinese porcelain, gold, silver, markets that exist, markets that don’t
exist today, and markets that others are making lots of money in that he
is not trading.12
Craven learned that philosophy of diversity while under P arker’s
tutelage. The number of markets they traded was always in fl ux: “We
could have sixty-fi ve markets or we could have thirty.” Craven was
once asked, “Are you always in the market? What’s the maximum
number of positions you could have on at any one time?” Craven re-
sponded. “It all depends. If the markets are going sideways, theoreti-
cally zero. The markets are trending up or down? I could have sixty- fi ve
positions.”
Unfortunately, what Parker does to make money in all those markets
is often confused with jargon terms like “managed futures” and “com-
modity trading advisor.” Both are government terms for hedge funds. In
many cases traders have been guilty of compounding the confusion, as
Parker was quick to admit:
I think another mistake we made was defining ourselves as “man-
aged futures,” where we immediately limit our universe. Is our
expertise in that, or is our expertise in systematic trend following,
or model development? Maybe we trend follow with Chinese
porcelain. Maybe we trend follow with gold and silver, or stock
futures, or whatever the client needs . . . We need to look at the
investment world globally and communicate our expertise of sys-
tematic trading.13
Communicating his expertise has always been a challenge. People
with trading philosophies that run counter to Parker’s have actively
spun the word “commodity” as something negative. It can’t be said

==================================================

enough, Turtle trend- following is a strategy. These traders trade fi nan-
cial instruments across the globe, ranging from stocks to currencies to
energies to wheat to gold to bonds to commodities.
Even though Parker has had a great run, he is still fighting the kind
of uphill battle that sunk many of his Turtle peers. He knows that peo-
ple look at systematic and computerized trading with too much skepti-
cism. He said, “I think we’ve mis- communicated to our clients what
our expertise really is. Our methods will work on lots of different mar-
kets. The ones that are hot today and the ones that are not hot today.”14
He could have been William Eckhardt in the Turtles’ classroom in
1984: There was no change in the message.
The Problem with Fundamentals
Like many top hedge-f und players today, Parker gives back to his com-
munity. He donated $500,000 to the University of Virginia for the
“Chesapeake Capital Trading Room.” It was designed as “a real- world,
highly sophisticated trading atmosphere.” Bob Webb, who is the Direc-
tor of The McIntire Center for Financial Innovation at UVA, graciously
gave a tour of the facility. With numerous trading desks and large quote
screens on the walls, you appreciate where every dollar of Parker’s do-
nation went.
Webb, who is a finance professor at UVA, sees the Chesapeake Cap-
ital Trading Room as “the ideal environment to illustrate real-t ime
events in financial markets. Students are able to examine the fi nancial
markets’ reaction to news events. Working there allows them to look at
recent changes and explore what factors promoted the changes.” Webb
says that “students get their feet wet right away. T hey’re able to make
predictions, based on real events, from the first day of class. They can
then look at factors that later cause prices to change, and that helps
them to make better decisions.”15
One business student unaware of Parker and the original Turtle
training environment, that office with cube dividers and no TVs, ex-
citedly described the new Chesapeake Capital trading room: “It’s
fantastic to be able to use the software to look up information about
any company. You can get balance sheets, income statements, ratios,

growth patterns—just about anything.”16 The irony, of course, is that
Parker would never use “just about anything” to make his trading
decisions.
The contradictions between Parker and these statements by a UVA
professor and student are not intentional. Webb, an accomplished pro-
fessor simply teaches a philosophy that sharply contrasts with Parker’s.

students enjoying the Chesapeake Room at UVA miss understanding
Parker’s trading style?
Over his career, Parker has repeatedly gone out of his way to educate
everyone that technical traders need no particular expertise in the
markets they trade, saying, “They do not need to be an authority on
meteorological phenomena, geopolitical occurrences or the economic
impact of specific worldwide events on a particular market.”18 Parker
often borders on exasperation as he fights to get that message across: “If
the alternative is massive diversification stocks only, buy and hold, or
listen to some analyst with a fundamental point of view. Well, you see
what that’s got us.”19 That logic can be hard for people to accept. Inves-
tors want big money potential along with a sophisticated story that
makes sense fundamentally.
And even if investors understand P arker’s Turtle style enough to
invest, they don’t want to watch their account equity going up and
down. Even P arker’s clients focus constantly on monthly rates of re-
turn. They hold him to a high standard, with admonitions like “ Don’t
give back my monthly profit,” “I am concerned with all of this monthly
data,” and “ You’re behind this month versus last month.” Parker said
flatly, “It is crazy.”
He added, “I think that risk from initial capital, losing 10%, that’s a
serious thing. If I’m up 50%, now I’m up 40%, that’s a whole different
thing. But not to clients! Not to the ratios. So we’re screwing around
with our profitability when we’re playing with the m arket’s money, and
trying to fi ne tune the performance table so we don’t have what looks
like a risky investment, even though it’s risky. But a much different risk
than the risk on initial capital. So I think it’s ridiculous.”20
Dressing up his performance to make it more palatable to nervous
clients is not something Parker likes:
No matter how well we do, I’m always being met with people who
are telling me, “doesn’t matter how much money you make or
how well you do, I just don’t like your style. I don’t like the style
that relies upon price only. I d on’t like commodities. And it’s
hocus- pocus.” When we’re down 20%, my gracious, [they think]
we’re on our way out of business. I’ve actually had people calling
me on the telephone, [when] maybe we’re down �12% and they’d

                     PAGE 179

Seizing Opportunity 163
say, “ You’re never going to come back. You’re never going to make
money. Forget it.” But if NASDAQ’s down �40%, that’s a pretty
good buying opportunity.21
The odd truth about fundamental traders is that behind closed
doors, they often trade very similarly to Parker. In public they might
talk about the NASDAQ down 40 percent as a good buying opportu-
nity, a value play, but for their actual trading they look for trends.
Parker saw this contradiction firsthand when he was purchasing
quantitative information from Ned Davis (a well- known analyst on
Wall Street). Parker was getting faxes every day, and he would compare
Davis’s analysis to his own positions. Parker, the trained skeptic, said to
the staff at D avis’s office, “It looks like a lot of times, almost all the time,
my positions are same as yours.” They told Parker, “That’s true because
even with all of our good analysis, if we don’t put a trend following
component in it, it doesn’t do very well.”22
That said, the most successful Turtle d oesn’t sugar- coat his style of
trading. He addresses the drawbacks head on. When he compares his
philosophy to a form of government, he sounds like a down- to-e arth
Sunday school preacher:
Trend following is like a democracy. Sometimes it doesn’t look so
good, but it’s better than anything else out there. Are we going to
rely on buy and hold? Buy and hope, that’s what I call it. Are we
going to double up when we lose money? The world is too big to
analyze. The fundamentals are too large. We need to aggressively,
unrepentantly sell trend following and describe it as it is: a system
of risk controls that gets in the right markets at the right times and
limits the disaster scenarios.23
Hedge Fund Blowups
In Jerry Parker’s world, the unexpected eventually happens. If you think
the world is tidy, get ready for the hurricane to blow you away. For
example, if there’s a good side to the 2006 implosion of the Amaranth
hedge fund (to the tune of $6 billion), it’s the embarrassment suffered
by the state and city pension funds that invested in it. And in



==================================================
                     PAGE 180                     
==================================================

164 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
Amaranth’s case, its name (a mythical flower that never fades) may
have held a hidden meaning. The secondary meaning: a pigweed.24
And “pigweed” all started with “mean reversion.” This term, with its
academic overtone, may make some people cringe, but understanding
its ramifications lies at the heart of why hedge funds Amaranth and
Long Term Capital Management went belly- up.
What is mean reversion? Over the long haul, market prices have a
tendency to “revert to the mean.” That is, studies have conclusively
shown that when stock prices (or any price, for that matter) get overex-
tended to the upside (or to the downside), they eventually fall back in
line with averages. However, stock prices do not exactly snap back into
place overnight. They can remain overvalued or undervalued for ex-
tended periods of time.25
That extended period of time is the sandbar that sinks ships. People
who bet on markets’ behaving in an orderly fashion (arbitrage) are pan-
ning for f ool’s gold. Parker and the other Turtles learned a long time
ago from Dennis that the hard thing to do is the right thing to do:
Mean reversion works almost all of the time. Then it stops and
you’re kind of out of business. The market is always reverting to
the mean except when it doesn’t. Who wants a system like we
have, “40% winners, losing money almost all the time, always in
a draw down, making money on about 10% of your trades, the rest
of them are sort of break even to losers, infrequent profi ts”? I
much prefer the mean reversion where I have 55% winners, 1%
or 2% returns per month. “I’m always right!” I’m always getting
positive feedback. Then, maybe in 8 years, you’re kind of out of
business, because when it doesn’t revert to the mean, your phi-
losophy loses.26
Hearing Parker’s Southern cadence as he preaches about mean re-
version hits home. Consider an example that makes his point: L et’s say
an investor gives a trader money because his two- year track record
shows he made 2 percent every month with no down months. Six years
later, that same fund blows up and that investor’s retirement is gone
because the strategy was predicated on mean reversion. It is human

nature to believe in mean reversion, but as Parker says, “it just is a fatal
strategy of trading the markets.”27
“Fatal” is the kind of word that grabs you by the throat. “Most of the
time” is not a good enough bet. The bottom line: Those hundred- year
floods that give mean- reversion traders solace really occur every two or
three years—and they can and do wipe out fortunes.
James River Capital
Back in the summer of 1994, the sign outside Parker’s offi ces in
Manakin- Sabot, Virginia, listed two firm names: Chesapeake Capital
and James River Capital. Since James River Capital smacked of State
of Virginia geography, it could have been anything. It turns out that
it was actually the new name for the firm that had risen from the ashes
of Kidder Peabody’s managed futures division.
Jonathan Craven saw how critical James River Capital was to Chesa-
peake Capital’s start. He said, “I met Jerry through somebody I knew at
James River Capital. Those guys introduced me to Jerry and I got hired
in March of 1990. We were renting space from James River for a long
time.” Investor Bradley Rotter added, “Jerry Parker did a very wise thing
early on in his career. He associated himself with Paul Saunders and
Kevin Brandt.” What Parker did was wise for good reason. Brokerage
firms were the perfect partners to sell the Turtles to the public as some-
thing sexy.
On the other hand, Erle Keefer thought Parker’s success had an ele-
ment of rolling the dice: “You would have never picked who, when
they left the Turtle program, would be phenomenal or not phenome-
nal I think it was a crapshoot.”
“Crapshoot” is not quite accurate, but Keefer saw an element of
randomness in Parker’s stratospheric rise: “What if it was another time
in history that was for the so-t o- speak ‘gambler,’ then it would be Tom
Shanks who would be trading a billion dollars and Jerry Parker would
be trading $250 million. I know a couple of other Turtles who d idn’t
want to trade public money. They wanted to drive a race car rather
than an aircraft carrier.” Keefer saw other Turtles who could have
had Parker’s level of success. He said, “If Paul Rabar would have



==================================================
                     PAGE 182                     
==================================================

166 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
got with those guys at Kidder Peabody rather than Jerry, Paul Rabar
would be the one that you’re writing about as trading a billion or two
billion dollars.”
However, Keefer was not slighting Parker: “Jerry was at the right
place at the right time and what he did is he did not impede himself. I
say that in the most positive of ways. Too many of us are presented with
an opportunity in life and we hesitate.” Exactly. At the end of the day,
Parker had to swing and hit the ball hard to win the game. He had to
make it happen. Parker whipped the bat through the strike zone with
ferocity.
However, don’t expect to see Parker on CNBC explaining how to
make money on unpredictable disasters. D on’t expect to see him on
Fox News debating politics with Hannity and Colmes. You have a
much better chance of meeting Parker at the local Richmond, Vir-
ginia, area Starbucks. The lesson: Be alert when buying your next
morning coffee. You just might meet a good trader to handle your re-
tirement money or the needed benefactor for your political run.

“I ran out of gas. I had a flat tire. I didn’t have enough money for
cab fare. My tux d idn’t come back from the cleaners. An old

Jake Blues,

Understanding why some Turtles were swallowed up in the pressure
cooker of ego and expectations while others went on to great success
reveals what is necessary to achieve long- term success. Liz Cheval was
blunt: “The most interesting thing about the Turtle program was ob-
serving who succeeded and who did not.”1 Cheval never expanded
publicly about which Turtles fell into which category, but the evidence
about which Turtles she was referring to was becoming clear.
Dennis himself acknowledged in a 2005 interview, “You could make
the case on reflection that it d idn’t make much difference who we
picked. The people who could sustain trading after the Turtle program
did so pretty much according to their abilities. While they were sort of
under our control, it didn’t make much difference how intrinsically
smart they were.”2
In fact, when referring to intrinsic intelligence, Dennis makes the
point that executing a well- designed trading system does not require,
intellect as a key factor: “Good traders apply every ounce of intelli-
gence they have into the creation of their systems, but then they’re
dumbbells in following them. You’ve got to have a schizoid approach.
Work like hell to make it good, and then ignore it like y ou’re a brick
wall. President Bush would be a great trader if he had a system.”3
Others offered a far different view. David Cheval, a peripheral player

in the Turtle story, and Curtis Faith didn’t buy the “anyone can do it”
premise from the man who actually proved it.4 Faith said: “You can
certainly teach trading and trading concepts. You can teach someone
to be a successful trader. There were marked differences in the perfor-
mance of the group. So some people couldn’t apply or learn trading.
Some took several years to catch on. I do believe that legends are born
not made. Decent traders can be made however. So I’m in the nature
and the nurture camp.”5
The Turtle story does not straddle the debate. Dennis proved con-
clusively that nurture trumped nature. However once the Turtles were
out of his program and out into the real world, many tried to capitalize
on their fame in an assortment of different ways. Their behavior pro-
vided fascinating insights about what not to do if making big money
making is your goal.
It turns out that Russell Sands was not the only Turtle to dispense
Dennis’s rules. Curtis Faith, referring to himself as an “original Turtle,”
started a website in April 2003 that at first promised to give the Turtles’
rules away free, provided those who found them useful sent a donation
to charity “in honor of Richard Dennis, Bill Eckhardt and the original
Turtles.”
Faith, without naming him directly, criticized Sands for profi ting off
the Turtle system: “. . . it always bothered me that some were making
money off the work of Richard Dennis and Bill Eckhardt without their
consent.”6
That said there is no evidence that Dennis had anything to do with
giving away his rules for charity. When asked about the rules being of-
fered free online, he sounded resigned: “Once I was walking down
Michigan Avenue and I heard somebody talking about it. It was pretty
clear that they were looking at the stuff and that they thought it some-
how had my blessing. What can I do?”7
But Faith’s charity soon turned capitalistic. In 2006, the website he
created switched gears, no longer asking for a charitable donation. The
website now charged $29.95 for Dennis’s rules. Faith and his fi rm
were doing what he had criticized Sands for. Additionally, while he had
criticized Sands for not trading profitably, there was absolutely no evi-
dence Faith was trading successfully either.
When explaining his career ups and downs, Faith referred back to

the money he made sixteen years before as a Turtle: “You’re prob-
ably thinking, ‘What happened to those millions?’ More than half
went to taxes, about a quarter went to charity and helping my father
out, and the rest went to start various businesses.” He said the biggest
chunk, $2 million, was invested into a software company.8
Faith explained in online chat rooms how this software fi rm (which
later became the focus of an SEC investigation) went bankrupt. He
blamed the firm’s implosion on a newly hired CEO. At the time
there were personal issues at play, too: “I went through a divorce and
gave pretty much all of the non- risk assets to my ex. I still loved her,
and we parted on good terms so I gave her the house, porshe [sic], etc.
Long and short of it is that I don’t have as much as I once did. I’m not
complaining as I’m still better off than most.”9
But different characterizations regarding Faith’s purported 2003
stock- trading losses, a disgruntled employee, and his personal solvency
were making the rounds in cyberspace. Faith commented on rumors of
his money woes in 2004: “I am not broke. I have had several periods in
the last several years where I was very, very low on cash, but that’s not
the same thing as being broke. Even if I had been broke, I’m not sure
it matters as I’m selling software, not advice on how not to ever go
broke.”10
Shortly thereafter, Faith launched his first trading effort since leav-
ing Dennis in 1988. Hedge World Daily ran with a headline describing
Faith’s and broker Yuri Plyam’s new Acceleration Mercury 4X LP
hedge fund. The new fund’s strategy was going to rely on three time
frames: a one- to two- day holding period, another holding period of ten
to fifty days, and a third for months to years.11
The pitch? Faith had taken a fifteen-y ear break from the trading
business and decided to get back into trading in order to take advantage
of breakthroughs in trading technology. He explained why clients
should be excited at the prospects of him managing their money: “Trad-
ers used to have to sit in front of the screen all day, but t hat’s no longer
necessary to trade successfully.”12 (It’s worth noting that Turtles trading
for Dennis never sat in front of a screen.)
Faith struck a confident tone in a chat room about coming out of
retirement to form new trading pools.13 Clearly, raising money for Ac-
celeration Capital without F aith’s name and his Turtle association

would have been difficult. Dennis and the word “Turtle” were lead
résumé points in the firm’s disclosure documents (and in assorted news
accounts).
While the ambitious Faith spoke of quickly raising a $100 million
fund, Acceleration Capital was started with less than $1 million of cli-
ent money—an extremely small amount for a hedge fund. The fund
traded for a short period, accrued significant losses, and was shut
down.
Unfortunately, the shutdown was not only due to bad performance.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a government regula-
tory arm similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission, started
investigating the fund.
An employee of Castle Trading (Castle and Acceleration were in the
same office) named Toby Wayne Denniston was embezzling customer
monies from Acceleration Capital. From November 2004 through Au-
gust 2005, this employee misappropriated $190,883 from the Acceler-
ation’s customer account. He was forging checks and concealing his
theft by altering the firm’s bank and trading account statements.14 Den-
niston bought a new BMW and took several trips with his stolen loot.
He was ultimately fined $250,000 in an August 2006 order.
Then a January 16, 2007 government order from a related investiga-
tion found Acceleration Capital responsible for Denniston’s actions.
The firm was barred from managing money for clients permanently
and fined $218,000. Yuri Plyam was also fined and prohibited from
acting as a commodity pool operator (hedge fund term) for three years.
The CFTC’s investigation (as of June 2007) is still ongoing, consisting
of an unreleased collection of 869 depositions, 694 pages of fi nancial
records, and 200 pages of trading records.
Faith should have been one of the biggest traders of the last twenty
years, but he was clearly missing that something Jerry Parker had. Au-
thor Jack Schwager, seeing the struggles of some Turtles, reeled in the
legend his Market Wizards books had created. He told me, “I don’t
think it was as much of a miracle as it has been popularized. My feeling
is that there is no magic here and perhaps no really great talents other
than the original founders.”
Schwager may have a point with Turtles such as Faith and others
who never traded to great success after the Turtle program ended.

However, twenty- year performance track records established by at least
six other Turtles and William Eckhardt are without a doubt impres-
sive.
At the end of the day, the Turtles could have all the trading rules in
the world, but if some were lazy or poor businessmen, if they lacked
motivation or the ability to follow through, their failure at trading—or
indeed at any entrepreneurial endeavor—was not a surprise.
But the success or failure of some of the original Turtles does not tell
us conclusively whether Dennis’s trading wisdom is truly transferable.
The Turtle story arguably remains little more than a fascinating corner
of investing history, but one without larger implications for the rest of
us. The key test is whether the Turtles themselves were capable of pass-
ing on the investing knowledge t hey’d learned, that t hey’d applied so
successfully while working for Dennis.
Fortunately, there is at least one person who provides inspirational
evidence of the true transferability of Dennis’s trading wisdom. He is
rock-s olid proof that a hard-w orking guy with no direct connection to
Dennis and Eckhardt could learn to make big money trading—all out
of a sleepy small town in the Texas panhandle. If the applicability of
Dennis’s original experiment to wider society has ever been doubted,
skeptics will need another excuse to explain away this second- generation
Turtle’s success. His name is Salem Abraham.

not an MBA, so I didn’t know I was broke.”
T. Boone Pickens
That second- generation Turtles exist is arguably the most important
part of the Turtle story. Ultimately, these “Turtles” present an even
more convincing argument supporting nurture over nature than does
the success of the original Turtles. They prove that (possibly) anyone
can be a Turtle today.
Second- generation Turtles include Mark J. Walsh, Jonathan Cra-
ven, John D. Fornengo (originally taught by Eckhardt in 1989), and
Salem Abraham, four traders among hundreds of trend followers who
all learned Turtle- style trend following secondhand. In turn, they built
trading businesses that in many instances far exceeded those of the
original Turtle traders.
When Walsh talks about his trading, it’s like hearing Dennis and
Eckhardt all over again, discussing strength and weakness: “If beans
are up 10 cents and corn is down five cents, we buy beans. Some
people think to buy corn because it’s going to catch up with beans.
We take the opposite. We’d rather buy the commodity t hat’s strongest
and sell the one that’s weakest.”1 Walsh saw Dennis as “generous with
his knowledge of the markets. He gave us a solid foundation on which
to build a program.”2
Two other second-g eneration Turtles are Robert Marcellus and Scot
Henry, who run the Richmond Group Fund. Little is publicly known
of their organization except that Henry once worked for Jerry Parker
and Kidder Peabody (James River Capital). Coincidentally, their home
base is in Manakin Sabot, Virginia, near Jerry Parker’s.
There are many ways to analyze successful entrepreneurial traders,

but “winning” is the starting point. Behind all the talk about teamwork
and balance, people still judge trading success by an individual’s abil-
ity to win big money. True competitors have a remarkable immunity
to failure. It’s simply not a factor that takes them out of the game even
when it happens. They have a single-m indedness and zealous disre-
gard for obstacles. They have indefatigable optimism. Winners pursue
the prize because they are sure they can get it. They’re less afraid of
striking out than of not taking every possible turn at bat that comes
their way.3
Many of the original Turtles simply did not think that way. Dennis
taught his original Turtles only part of what made him successful.
There was no way he could teach them the inner drive that had pro-
pelled him from the South Side of Chicago to becoming “Prince of the
Pit.” Dennis was forced by necessity to learn the hard way, just like so
many second- generation Turtles.
Of all of the second- generation Turtles, one stands out. When Sa-
lem Abraham started trading he had no prior experience with Dennis
and Eckhardt, no group of like- minded Turtle traders with whom to
share experiences. He hadn’t worked for Goldman Sachs or for any
other hedge fund. Yet it didn’t matter one iota.
With his pleasant demeanor, thick brown hair, and compact phy-
sique, Salem Abraham looks younger than his forty years. He could
be mistaken for one of his ranch hands, but his Texas drawl and
friendly manner mask a steely entrepreneurial drive that goes back
generations.
How far away was Abraham from a Wall Street pedigree? He comes
from a family of Christian Lebanese immigrants who settled in rural
Canadian, Texas, in 1913. His grandfather, Malouf “Oofi e” Abraham,
sold ready-t o-w ear clothing out of a suitcase along the railroad before
opening a retail store.
Before Abraham was headed down the path to becoming a trader, he
attended Notre Dame and planned to marry his childhood sweetheart,
Ruth Ann. He was going to start a mail- order business. While he did
marry Ruth Ann and while he still lives in Canadian, Texas, it is not the
story of his mail-o rder career that makes people take notice. It is his
twenty- year trading performance:

I first interviewed Salem Abraham face- to-f ace in his office in 2005.
His world offers instant culture shock. Canadian, Texas, is the epitome
of small-t own America, but with a big twist. Abraham’s success has al-
lowed him to endow his tiny town with amenities unusual in commu-
nities several times its size.
Canadian’s Main Street (with one stoplight) now has the Cattle Ex-
change steakhouse and a restored movie theater with a digital sound
system. Abraham has spent millions to create this oasis. How was he
able to do it?
Meeting a Turtle
Salem Abraham would never have pursued trading if not for a chance
meeting with Jerry Parker. It was the spring of 1987. He was at Notre
Dame with one semester left, determined to graduate in three and a
half years in order to start his mail- order business. Then he attended a
family wedding where he met Parker, and his life changed.
Abraham was making casual conversation with Parker (whose wife
and Abraham shared mutual first cousins), with no expectation of a

life-c hanging moment at hand. He asked Parker what he did for a liv-
ing. Parker said, “We figure out the odds and t here’s certain patterns
that we look for. Then we manage our risk and when these patterns
happen, you put on certain trades.” Abraham incredulously followed
up, “The odds are in your favor? You’re sure of that?”
When Abraham heard the Turtle story for the first time, he was
floored. He recalled, “Jerry told me about Richard Dennis and told me
about these guys that he hired to train to trade. He told me that every-
body’s making money and how much money they’ve made each year.”
Abraham, who’d already decided he wanted “to make a living in a little
town in Texas,” quickly said to himself, “This can work from Canadian.
It’s right up my alley.”
At that moment he saw an opportunity, just as his grandfather had
decades before when the railroad was being built. He had never before
heard of the Turtles or Richard Dennis, yet he took stock of P arker’s
career, and without knowing the specifics, immediately shifted his
goals in life to pursue trading. No more mail- order business.
Luckily for Abraham, Parker said that if he ever wanted to visit Rich-
mond he would show him some things to point him in the right direc-
tion. Abraham called the next week. It never occurred to Abraham that
Parker might have been making polite social conversation, never
dreaming that Abraham would take him up on the offer.
The thought that he might have been imposing on Parker simply did
not occur to Abraham, who later described his mindset at the time: “I
think you’re kind of young and dumb and you just say, ‘He made the
offer and that means he really means it.’ ” When Abraham called, all he
could hear was, “Well, ah.” At that moment Abraham knew Parker was
just trying to be nice to the new relative. But Parker finally said, “Sure,
come on out.”
Abraham knew the immediate import of Parker living in Richmond
and trading out of his home office for his own plans to build a career in
tiny Canadian. That bit of knowledge told him that all he needed was
a telephone line to potentially be the next Jerry Parker. The self-
confidence to instantly switch gears from mail- order business ideas to a
trading career was the first sign of a true entrepreneur in action. Abra-
ham was also very fortunate to have grown up in a family of entrepre-
neurs who would take a chance on his seemingly crazy trading idea.

Those who immediately interpret this to mean Abraham got a free
family gift may want to reconsider. It was his responsibility to use his
very limited capital wisely. So not surprisingly, he saw “risk manage-
ment” as the big lesson during their first meeting at P arker’s offi ce.
Abraham recalled, “Jerry was clearly aware that there were things that
were proprietary he couldn’t tell me.” But he said to Abraham, “Look,
this trend- following works, and here’s some ideas you ought to think
about,” and then gave him some risk management concepts to think
about. Reflecting on Parker’s generosity Abraham, said, “I certainly
would never be in the position I’m in without his early help. I would
never be where I am now.”
At the time Abraham knew nothing about trading. He had no experi-
ence, but he started researching after meeting Parker at his offi ce. Back
at Notre Dame, he then read everything he could about Richard Den-
nis and trend followers. He said, “If you want to be successful at some-
thing, well, you want to identify who’s been successful and what are
they doing.”
During his last semester at Notre Dame, Abraham touted the suc-
cess of Dennis to deaf ears. His professors weren’t interested. They said
Richard Dennis was “lucky.” It’s not surprising that professors were
skeptical, since Abraham was preaching a gospel that went squarely
against the notion of effi cient markets—the backbone of generally ac-
cepted fi nancial truth.
Nor was Abraham the only convert to new success following a con-
versation with Jerry Parker. Off the record, another trader also spoke to
me about Parker’s generosity with trading advice. Parker had helped
him navigate the waters of setting up his trading fi rm many years ago.
That trader is worth close to $100 million today.
Taking the Plunge
Once Abraham had Parker’s initial mentoring, he started researching
trend-f ollowing trading rules by hand. It was messy. He was marking
charts, noting his risk rules and then just keeping tabs every day. “If I
would have bought here, sold here, bought here, sold here.”
He went to his grandfather with a portfolio of twenty- one markets
that he had tested over an eight- month period, and said, “Look, if I had



==================================================

started with a million dollars, it’d be worth $1.6 million at the end of
eight months.” He was excited to show all the stuff he had been work-
ing on. Abraham’s grandfather, who at that time was seventy- two, had
seen lots of Texas deals. He was skeptical of his grandson’s new ven-
ture.
His grandfather’s skepticism would be hard to overcome and Abra-
ham had to have been pretty tough to take the withering sarcasm that
followed. His grandfather said, “What are we going to do? I guess we
just package this up and send it to Chicago. They cut us some check,
right, dumb-a ss? You may think y ou’re a smart kid coming out of Notre
Dame, but these guys in Chicago, they’re going to chew you up and
spit you out. Of all the ways to lose money, why in the hell did you have
to pick the very fastest way?”
Not about to be dismissed, Abraham explained the wisdom behind
his trading philosophy. He said he was going to use good risk manage-
ment, explaining, “Just because you have a Lamborghini, you d on’t
have to go 160 miles an hour. I’m never going past 30 and I’m going to
control risk.”
It was obvious where Abraham had inherited his confi dence and
entrepreneurial zeal. More than just hard business truths had been
passed down from generation to generation. Abraham had also been
given a moral business compass. His grandfather used to say that if you
screw one person, you’re done and you are out of business. He wanted
his grandsons to always keep their word, number one. But he also
wanted them to go above and beyond what’s fair, saying, “Make sure,
even though that’s not the deal.” The legendary investor Boone Pick-
ens, a longtime family friend, saw heredity playing a role in Abraham’s
drive. He had known the family for fifty years and saw them make a
great contribution to the Texas panhandle.4
Luckily for Abraham, he had grown up around entrepreneurial risk-
taking and even participated in some family business deals. He learned
the most from the potential deals that went awry. On one oil and gas
deal that he learned about from his grandfather, he decided that he
would talk to the representative at Shell Oil. Abraham thought they
would sell a piece of land to him.
His grandfather knew it was going nowhere, saying, “No way. They’ve
had this for thirty years, forty years we’ve all talked to them. They won’t

do anything with anybody.” Abraham was not deterred, and said, “This
guy at Shell Oil, he’s new there. I think he’ll do something.”
His grandfather responded with some attitude: “Tell you what, if you
get that deal done, I will kiss your butt out there in the middle of the
intersection under that stoplight right there.” Abraham replied to his
grandfather, “Pucker up, old man, because it’s going happen.” The
deal never happened.
However, it was that same entrepreneurial fearlessness that Abra-
ham used to launch his trading career that last semester at Notre Dame.
It demanded burning the candle at both ends. He was trading twenty-
one markets and taking a grueling twenty- one semester hours. He was
cramming, and all of his classes had to be scheduled in the afternoon.
He would wake up at 7 a.m. and trade from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. Then he
would put his stops in and go to class. After class he would check to see
if his stops had been hit.
The fall of 1987 was no ordinary time, especially for a brand- new
trader experiencing historic market volatility. During the last part of
September and the first part of October, the interest rates started going
straight down. Abraham had come home for fall break on October 19,
1987. He recalled, “The Friday before fall break I made a lot of money.
My $50,000 was $66,000 as of Friday. I’m going home and I’m feeling
great.” Then, Monday morning, the stock market tanked.
These were big events. Things were going haywire. Abraham wor-
ried about his positions in Eurodollars. He called up his broker and
said, “So where are Eurodollars?” His broker replied, “They’re up
250.’ ” Abraham shot back, “Two fifty, what do you mean, 25?” His
broker said, “No, 250.’ ” Abraham wanted to know if it was as bad as
what he was thinking. He immediately knew that that move was in the
neighborhood of 10+ standard deviations away from where Eurodollars
normally traded.
His $66,000 had dropped to $33,000. But by the end of the day, he
considered it all a great lesson. He had learned the signifi cance of
hanging in there to play another day. He felt that to survive at this point
in his trading career, with his own money on the line, and not blow
out, was “okay.” He recalled, “The one lesson I was clear on: always
know the thing that they say can never happen, can happen.”
Abraham took a short break after the 1987 October crash. He was

out of the markets for a week or so and then got back in. He traded dur-
ing November and a little bit of December and then shut down for the
year. His account had bounced back to $45,000 from that $33,000 low.
He took $1,600 out of his account and went to Jim’s Guns, Gold, and
Diamonds to buy an engagement ring to propose to his now wife.
Commodities Corporation
Starting in 1988 Abraham wanted to trade full time, but he still had to
prove himself to his grandfather. He told his grandfather, “I want to do
this on the side. I know w e’re not that busy. Will you let me do this on
the side?” He had $45,000, and his older brother Eddie agreed to put
up $15,000. His younger brother Jason put in $10,000 to get the “Abra-
ham brother fund” up to $70,000. He wanted his grandfather to put in
$30,000 so he would have an even $100,000 trading account.
His grandfather was willing to play ball, but true to Abraham family
ethos there would be a deal. He announced, “Okay, here’s the deal. I’ll
put up $30,000. But if we get down to $50,000, we throw that quote
machine out the window and we stop all this trading nonsense.”
For a man in his early twenties, Salem Abraham was taking on some
serious risk and pressure. And as is often the case, just when he was out
of the gate with his $100,000 account for his new trading firm, the bot-
tom dropped out.
The first two weeks of May 1988 were horrible markets. Abraham
was downstairs in his office when his grandfather stuck his head in one
morning and said, “Where are we today?” Abraham replied, “Sixty-
eight thousand dollars.” In sarcastic glee, his grandfather said, “Just a
matter of time,” and he walked out the door.
Time never happened. The grain market drought of 1988 hit and
Abraham was long soybeans, corn, and wheat. The markets just ex-
ploded the second half of May and into June. He was very well posi-
tioned and rocked along to serious profi t.
How could Abraham have been certain that bigger things were
around the corner with the kind of volatility he had seen in his fi rst
eight months of trading? Plenty of people would have quit, chalking it
up to a failed business venture. In spite of the ups and downs, once he’d
shown his grandfather that he was on to a profitable angle, the senior

Abraham came on board in a big way. His grandfather walked in the
door one day with a “Dean Witter Principal Guarantee Fund 2” bro-
chure and threw it on his grandson’s desk, declaring, “Hey, you did
better than these guys did.”
Commodities Corporation was the manager of the Dean Witter
fund, and they were in the process of raising $100 million and allocat-
ing it among eight to ten traders. Commodities Corporation had quite
a history. They were a prominent Princeton, New Jersey–based trading
incubator (now part of Goldman Sachs following a late- 1990s buyout).
They were responsible for the early funding (and in some instances
training) of hedge fund greats such as Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon,
Ed Seykota, Bruce Kovner, and Michael Marcus.
Abraham did not know all that history at the time. He just picked up
the phone and called Commodities Corporation. He got Elaine
Crocker on the phone late in the day. Crocker, who now runs Louis
Bacon’s Moore Capital and today may be the most powerful woman in
the hedge fund industry, said she would send some information. Abra-
ham doubted Crocker was taking him seriously, because he had only a
one- year track record.
But eventually Commodities Corporation got back in touch with
him, announcing that they were going to be in Houston and inviting
him to meet with them. He jumped at the opportunity and flew to the
Houston airport to meet Crocker and Michael Garfi nkel.
Abraham had just celebrated his twenty- third birthday before the
meeting. Garfinkel did most of the talking. Crocker sat back and
watched the discussion. Garfinkel said, “Wow, last month was a tough
month. What happened?” Abraham pointed out that during the cur-
rent month he was up 40 percent.
Crocker started laughing. Not seeing the humor in his response,
Abraham asked. “What’s so funny about up 40 percent?” Garfi nkel,
sensing a disconnect, wanted to know what kind of returns Abraham
was shooting for. Abraham gave the Turtle-l ike answer of 100 percent a
year. And just like many of the original Turtles were told after leaving
Dennis, Crocker wanted Abraham to back off his riskier “shoot for the
moon” approach. She and Garfinkel made the same observation Jerry
Parker and others had heard: “If you make 30 percent a year, people
will beat a path to your door. You need to back off on the leverage.”

==================================================

182 TheCompleteTurtleTrader
Commodities Corporation still wanted to see a ten- year simulation
of Abraham’s system—something he did not have. Their request forced
Abraham to learn programming to quickly test his trading system. The
pressure was on. It started Abraham down the path of developing a
whole new research and programming skill set. It was just one of the
many ways he was setting himself apart from the original Turtles.
There was one more consideration in the deal. Commodities Cor-
poration wanted to invest Abraham’s minimum account size. Since he
had no minimum, he settled on $200,000, rightfully surmising that
Commodities Corporation would pony up to a reasonable number. He
was right, and they became his first big client.
For a young man with no trading pedigree and no hedge fund expe-
rience, this investment was admission to the major leagues. Commodi-
ties Corporation invested the next $7 to $8 million in his firm as well.
That initial $30,000 investment from his grandfather? It’s worth $1.3
million today.
However, even with all that moneymaking success, Abraham was
still just a young guy, and his experiences with the establishment ques-
tioning his credibility were similar to those of the young Richard Den-
nis. Reminiscent of Dennis’s trip to the bank to cash the $250,000
check was Abraham trying to rent a car at age twenty- five, with no
luck since they had recently raised the minimum age requirement. He
was managing $15 million, but the Hertz counter was not budging on
renting to him. Salem, after attempting to negotiate, tried some atti-
tude: “Do you know that I have people who entrust $15 million with
me, and I can buy and sell whatever I want to with this $15 million?
You w on’t loan me a car? A $15,000, $20,000 car for the day?” The lady
at the counter was looking him up and down thinking, “Yeah, right,
I’m not believing you, punk.” Salem added, “I had to call Joe’s Rent- a-
Wreck.”
Dennis and Eckhardt Training
Even people who are knowledgeable about the Turtles do not know
about an obscure third Turtle class after the 1983 and 1984 original
ones on which the Turtle legend was built. Abraham actually received
personal instruction from Dennis and Eckhardt several years after his



==================================================
                     PAGE 199                     
==================================================

Second-Generation Turtles 183
trading firm was launched. In the early 1990s, Commodities Corpora-
tion asked Dennis and Eckhardt to hold a third Turtle class for their
stable of traders. Commodities Corporation was giving them money to
trade, and part of the deal was that they had to hold a seminar. The
seminar was supposed to simulate the Turtle trader experience, except
instead of two weeks, it was held over four days.
While Abraham was already trading by Turtle- style trend- following
trading rules, and while he found much of the training to reinforce
what he already knew (“What I got out of it was a lot of risk manage-
ment ideas, position sizing ideas, and system analysis ideas.”), the class-
room experience with thirty students from Commodities Corporation
was a memorable part of his education.
However, Abraham saw his learning process as a step- by- step jour-
ney, not just a lucky leap: “It’s like climbing a mountain. Which step
was the most important? Every step is needed to get to the top of the
mountain. Each individual step is not that much.” This makes him far
more the “average guy” than Parker, Rabar, or any of the other original
Turtles, who had four years of Dennis covering the overhead costs.
The seminar opened Abraham’s eyes though. He was very impressed
by William Eckhardt. All of the students had also been given an ad-
vance copy of Eckhardt’s interview in the New Market Wizards. Abra-
ham added, “I went into that meeting thinking, ‘Oh yeah, Richard
Dennis, he’s the guy and Eckhardt is the sidekick’ kind of deal.” Just as
the original Turtles had learned during their training, Abraham discov-
ered that he was wrong: “However when I got through, I really appreci-
ated the math and the objective data. The statistics of this works, this
doesn’t work. It’s all odds. I actually got more useful information from
Eckhardt. But of course Richard Dennis is clearly a brilliant trader.”
Dennis would basically tell the class, “The system is a nice thing to
guide you, but it’s okay to set the system aside.” Eckhardt was saying
something a little different: “These are the odds; it’s all a math game.”
Nothing had changed about the two teachers since the original Turtle
experiment.
Eckhardt challenged the Commodities Corporation traders with a
series of questions. There were ten questions the traders had to answer
within a range. The goal was to get nine of the ten correct. Eckhardt
asked, “What does a 747 plane weigh?” The answer could be as big a

range as the traders wanted it to be, but the goal was to be 90 percent
certain that they were right. It tested their confidence and their ability
to estimate. Everyone missed four or five questions. Eckhardt said that
the majority of people missed about 45 percent of the questions be-
cause they were overconfident in their ability to estimate reality.
Trend trading thrives on that overconfidence. Abraham made this
point using the recent surge in the price of oil over the last few years:
“What you see in trend following is people’s mistaken mindset of what’s
a high price and what’s a low price. It all has to do with a very limited
set of experiences. People make assumptions for a small sample size.
To think that crude oil could go from $20 to $70, you say, ‘that’s nuts.’
To buy crude oil at $55? That’s a hard bet to do when it’s never been to
$56. Never in the history of the world has it been to $56 and you say, ‘It
hit $55 today, I’m buying it.’ ”
Can you imagine buying a market that is making an all-t ime high,
without any knowledge that it will keep going up or come crashing
back down? Abraham put the focus where it really counts: “I care
about the statistics.” He gave me an example. Pretend a physicist walks
in with a coin and says, “This coin will always come up 50–50 heads
or tails.” A statistician, however, walks in and says, “Yes, but I fl ipped
it one million times and 65 percent of the time it came up heads.”
The Harvard-t rained physicist says, “That is impossible; it’s a 50–50
coin.”
Abraham asked, “Who do you believe?” He had many college pro-
fessors with plenty of good reasons why that coin should not be coming
up heads 65 percent of the time, but at some point you have to say, “I
don’t know why this coin is coming up 65 percent heads, but I’m will-
ing to bet after a million flips that the 65 percent rate will hold true
even when on the face of it, it shouldn’t.” Abraham added, “Just be-
cause I don’t understand it doesn’t mean I’m not going to bet on it.”
Ultimately, Abraham was saying the same thing that Tom Willis had
said years before, which was to just trade the “numbers.” The empiri-
cist in Abraham was driving at the concept of the unexpected big event;
the nexus of his trading profits derived from trading “price.” Is the world
due for another large unexpected event that will give him a chance to
profi t? He did not blink: “Yes, but it will be one that we’ve never seen
before. It’s always a different one.”

Boil the Ocean
Abraham might not be in Wall Street’s top ten in terms of earnings yet.
He might not be managing a billion-d ollar fund at this moment in his
life, but he has done exceedingly well. Sitting in his offi ce, fi lled with
evidence of his eclectic interests ranging from oil and gas leasing proj-
ects to the restoration of antique books and papers, he has made a life
for himself that includes family, friends, and a company of like- minded
people drawn from his local community.
His hiring practices come very close to mimicking D ennis’s original
Turtle hiring process. No one at Abraham’s firm has an Ivy League
degree. Most employees have backgrounds working at the area’s feed-
lots or natural gas–drilling companies. For example, Abraham hired
Geoff Dockray as a clerk from one of those very feedlots. Dockray ap-
preciated the opportunity to work in Abraham’s office. He said, “This
beats shoveling manure at 6 a.m. in the morning. The fi nancial mar-
kets are complicated but they’re not as relentless as dealing with live-
stock all the time.”5
Maybe it is that down- to- earth perspective gleaned from living in
handshake country that gives Abraham a clear perspective. Sitting in
the Cattle Exchange steakhouse located in the historic Moody Build-
ing, which he owns and where he has his office, he had no doubts that
it is his entrepreneurial tenacity: “I think they [the winning Turtles]
have a self- confidence or charisma to run a business. There’s a drive to
go out and do it. Then there is a drive to want to do it. Some people
[the losing Turtles] will just say, ‘Oh, hey, I made some money. T hat’s
all I need.’ ”
However, if you are going to boil the ocean (in other words, if you
are going to use all means and options available to get something done),
especially if it is a very competitive and lucrative endeavor, there will
be ups and downs. Salem A braham’s experience has been no different.
Twice during his trading career, clients left after down or fl at perfor-
mance periods. He regrouped and made new equity highs each time.
During trying times, he handled curve balls in his career by working on
other ideas to make money. He always focused on his trading, but he
also cast a wider net and caught other kinds of fi sh.
As with trading, not everything works out. One project was a water

deal that he almost cut with billionaire T. Boone Pickens ( “Couldn’t
agree on the price”). Pickens and Abraham’s ranches are right next to
each other in the Texas panhandle (even though they are separated by
forty miles, their ranches touch) and they have become friends over the
years; Pickens was not shy about praising Abraham’s entrepreneurial
guts when I talked to him in his Dallas offi ce.
There were other deals that turned out to be big winners. Abraham
was humble about them: “I sold water rights to the city of Amarillo. I
invested $1.5 million and I got $9 million out. I said to myself, ‘That’s
a cool idea.’ Then I did the Chicago Mercantile Exchange deal [CME
Initial Public Offering]. I put $1.5 million in, and got about $13 mil-
lion out. You recognize opportunities where you see them.”
This kind of thinking and risk- taking is how to make your fi rst mil-
lion by age twenty-fi ve—which Abraham did. Still, it’s not enough to
simply spot opportunities. The confidence to act on them is manda-
tory. You need a killer instinct. When faced with real life and death,
even with chickens and pigs, it is never easy to pull the trigger or snap
a chicken’s neck, even for dinner. You have to be able to pull the trigger
when there is blood on Wall Street, especially if the blood is yours.6
Jerry Parker could not have known Salem Abraham would have the
prerequisite killer instinct when they first met. Parker was probably
thinking, “Okay, this young guy has got a rough idea of what I do. I’ve
given him some pointers. If he’s serious, he’s going to figure it all out
and ‘just do it,’ but I will be surprised if he hangs around.”
Unlike the original Turtles who won the job lottery—who were
given the exact winning rules and allowed to practice on Richard
Dennis’s dime, all in the womblike atmosphere of C&D Commodi-
ties—Abraham was on his own from the get-g o. He is tougher for it.
There is far more to learn from the attitude and actions of this second-
generation Turtle than from any one original Turtle.

“Are Turtles grown, or can be they taught? Do they have a magic
sixth sense or something? The jury is in, isn’t it? They’d be better
off having the knowledge implanted than relying on a sixth sense.
I think I could take a kid who wasn’t my son and say, ‘Do this, I’ll
pay you $50,000 a year, or you’re fired if you d on’t exactly follow
it.’ He’d beat me every day, every week, every month and every
year.”1
Tom Willis
The Turtle story breaks down into two parts. Part one takes place
during the experiment, when the Turtles are on the relatively level
playing field designed by Richard Dennis. His experiment proves nur-
ture trumps nature. Part two takes place after the experiment, when the
Turtles have to face the real world as individuals and human nature
reenters the picture.
While the experiment itself is what made headlines, some people
familiar with the Turtle story recognized the greater significance of part
two, the experiment’s aftermath as Turtles attempt to carry on solo.
Larry Hite called me late on a Friday afternoon after we’d had lunch
near his Park Avenue office. Hite, who founded Mint Capital and was
instrumental in the early successes of the multibillion- dollar Man Fi-
nancial hedge fund, had more feedback for me about my Turtle book
(i.e., the one you’re reading now).
“I have been thinking about this new book. . . .” He laid it out: “The
people who are very good and long-l asting are tough. If life goes against
them, they stick to their game. There is a certain amount of mental
toughness to have clarity. Toughness is just the ability to roll with the
punches. They don’t get disappointed by losses. Some people when
they lose, they don’t get back up. Think about the Turtles who failed at

trading. What did the failures have in common? Maybe the ones who
failed just gave up. They were not tough.”
Dennis demanded that the Turtles be mentally tough as long as
they worked for him, but once he pulled the plug they had to face
head on what Dennis was not providing them. Hite saw it. He brought
up the memo (see chapter 7) sent out by Dennis telling the Turtles to
cut back their leverage by 50 percent. He observed that Dennis had
made an error, ignored any knock against his ego, acknowledged the
mistake, and fixed it. That was “an act of mental toughness” in H ite’s
book.
But Dennis did not select his students for strength of character and
drive to win, nor did he train them on the fine art of mental toughness.
On that level playing field where he covered the overhead, every-
one appeared mentally tough. However, it turned out that only Turtles
like Jerry Parker, Paul Rabar, and a few others, and later, Salem Abra-
ham, actually shared the same drive and entrepreneurial spirit that
Dennis had.
Think about the annual drafts of professional sports teams. They
demonstrate this same inability to screen candidates for mental tough-
ness. For example, every year college stars get drafted with much fan-
fare. Every year at least one significant stud, one “ can’t miss” prospect,
fails. Look how many thousands of great college players never make it
to the NFL, NBA, or Major League Baseball. Something separates pre-
tenders from contenders. Innate talent alone is never enough.
The same is true when it comes to making money. Take, for exam-
ple, the top ten earners in the hedge fund industry for 2005:
1. James Simons, Renaissance Technologies Corp.: $1.5 billion
2. T. Boone Pickens, Jr., BP Capital Management: $1.4 billion
3. George Soros, Soros Fund Management: $840 million
4. Steven Cohen, SAC Capital Advisors: $550 million
5. Paul Tudor Jones II, Tudor Investment Corp.: $500 million
6. Edward Lampert, ESL Investments: $425 million
7. Bruce Kovner, Caxton Associates: $400 million

8. David Tepper, Appaloosa Management: $400 million
9. David Shaw, DE Shaw & Co.: $340 million
10. Stephen Mandel, Jr., Lone Pine Capital: $275 million
Those men got to the top ten by more than rules alone. While not
everyone can make Wall Street’s top ten (and many of those top ten are
trend- type traders), the story of the Turtles is compelling proof that it is
possible to learn the steps top earners took and replicate their process.
The greater challenge, the real “secret,” comes in following the foot-
steps of those trading entrepreneurs in part two of the story. All of the
winners role- model that extra drive—call it self- confi dence, toughness,
or entrepreneurial passion—that proves it is possible to surmount those
biases inherent in human nature that hold the majority of people
back.
To cultivate that extra drive, however, requires deliberate practice.
Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger (Warren Buffet’s number two
man) has lived it; he has said, “In my whole life, I have known no wise
people over a broad subject matter area who didn’t read all the time—
none, zero.”2 Most people do not want the real work that comes with
real success.
Look at Eddie Lampert, too (number six on the top ten). His nurture
process had him reverse- engineering Warren B uffett’s thought pro-
cess. He said, “Putting myself in his shoes at that time, could I under-
stand why he made the investments? That was part of my learning
process.”3Second-g eneration Turtles did the same thing when it came
to Dennis.
Further, consider the similarities between the skills of a surgeon and
those of a trader. Great surgeons are the ones who are conscientious,
industrious, and boneheaded enough to keep practicing day and night
for years on end.4 Once again, nurture over nature.
The bottom line is that the market doesn’t care about you person-
ally. It d oesn’t care about your gender, culture, religion, or race. It’s
one of the last frontiers where low barriers to entry allow anyone to bet
his cash and take a whack at making big money. In the end, traders like
Jerry Parker, Salem Abraham, and Richard Dennis are playing a legiti-
mate game that anyone can play.

And you don’t have to have been lucky enough to answer a Richard
Dennis want ad in 1983 to be a successful trader. Salem Abraham only
needed to know that Dennis and his philosophy existed; from that point
on, he would figure it out. That is the reason why Abraham is so impor-
tant to the story. He embodies the stubborn determination and entre-
preneurial guts played out over the four decades since Dennis fi rst
entered the Chicago pits.
However, the best affirmation of this story’s enduring legacy came
from Richard Sandor (a legendary figure in his own right, often viewed
as a founding father of the financial futures markets) when we shared a
few moments at Chicago O’Hare baggage claim in fall 2006. Sandor
spoke directly to practicing, winning, and never giving up. Smiling
broadly, he said with a glow of admiration and respect as we parted
ways, “You do know that Richard Dennis is trading again?”
That simple comment said it all. It solidified my belief that we all
have the opportunity to build upon our inborn gifts. Ultimately, the
path that led a regular Chicago guy to the top, that led him to teach a
handful of beginners to win big and make millions like him and in
many ways inspired a generation of Wall Street titans from up close
and afar, is a path we can all take.

“It’s not the uniqueness of the idea that’s the key. It’s the unique-
ness of your ability to implement it.”

Salem Abraham, Second- generation Turtle
In 2006, Shaun Jordan (with Abraham Trading) organized a two- day
visit for me to Canadian, Texas—Salem Abraham’s home and offi ce
location. During the visit, Abraham put William Eckhardt’s utility the-
ory of risk in perspective with an example.
Assume a coin-fl ipping game. You have $10 million to your name.
For the game, you get to bet $10 million per flip. With this coin you
have a 90 percent chance of winning another $10 million, but you
have a 10 percent chance of losing $10 million—all of your money.
Can you really afford to bet it all, even if the odds are in your favor? No.
Abraham clarified: “As an odds guy I go ‘ That’s a great bet.’ I will take
the bet. But, wait a minute. If the upside is $10 million, the downside
is $10 million . . . I’ve seen guys around here in Texas oil and gas busi-
nesses and they go broke. They’re great oil and gas guys, but they bet
the ranch too many times and lost it.”
Anthony Bruck, Turtle Class of 1983
There is no public information about Anthony Bruck except that he is
a board member of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. He is apparently
still associated with C&D Commodities. However, it is not clear if
C&D Commodities is still an active business or if it just a collegial as-
sociation between Dennis and Bruck.

and has ridden more than 40,000 miles.
Michael Cavallo, Turtle Class of 1983
Michael Cavallo continued to answer want ads after his work with
Dennis ended. By answering one such ad, Cavallo eventually became
the United States Chess Federation executive director. He is also a for-
mer New York City Junior Chess champion, with a then ranking of
2,142. He at one time reached the level of “master.”
Cavallo has also established and funded The Cavallo Foundation,

Jim DiMaria, Turtle Class of 1984
Jim DiMaria likes the way things have worked out over the last twenty-
five years. Would he have liked to make more money? Sure. However,
there are always trade- offs. He clearly sees those: “Because of the fl exi-
bility of trading, if you use technology right, we picked up and moved
to France for three years with the kids. So it was great for the family.
The kids are native French speakers. We traveled all over the place. We
loved it. I think I traded from twenty- three different countries.”
Of all the Turtles, DiMaria did the best job of explaining why blow-
ups happen in the hedge fund world. He saw the root of the problem

with “allocators,” the investors with the money who allocate it across a
wide grouping of traders: “The biggest single problem with these allo-
cators is they completely confuse volatility and standard deviation with
‘risk.’ The two are completely noncorrelated. They want Amaranth,
Long Term Capital Management, and III [name of a hedge fund that
blew up] and that’s going to work 95 percent of the time, but when it
doesn’t, they’re broke.”
William Eckhardt, Turtle Teacher and
Partner of Richard Dennis
The teacher of the Turtles today manages roughly $1 billion for clients.
Beyond his trading, he has remained engaged in his own philosophical
pursuits. In 1993, Eckhardt’s article “Probability Theory and the
Doomsday Argument” was published in the philosophical journal
Mind. His follow-u p article, “A Shooting- Room View of Doomsday,”
was published in the Journal of Philosophy. Both articles made argu-
ments skeptical of the Doomsday Argument as formulated by John Les-
lie.2 The Doomsday Argument (DA) is a probabilistic argument that
claims to predict the future lifetime of the human race given only an
estimate of the total number of humans born so far.3
Interestingly, in January 2001, Eckhardt Trading Company took
over the employment of a number of people previously employed by
C&D Commodities. The world of those associated with the Turtles
remains small and close- knit.

placed first at the Northern California Regional Chess Championship
in 2005.
Gordon provides some food for thought about the dreaded “risk”
that everyone must cope with at one time or another: “People’s attitude
about risk was a very important aspect of being a trader. Can that be
taught? Well, it can be taught intellectually. Can it be taught so that it
is in the gut? I am not so sure about that. I am not saying no, but I am
saying that it is hard. If you ever try to change some of your basic atti-
tude towards basic things like risk, there are people who are more com-
fortable with risk than others. It comes from upbringing. It comes from
attitude, life experiences, and being rewarded or being burned from
taking risk in the past.”
Erle Keefer, Turtle Class of 1984
Erle Keefer was the oldest Turtle hired. He was about the same age as
Dennis, thirty- seven years old, when he started out as a Turtle. Describ-
ing himself physically he chuckled, “I’m a miniature Rich.”
He also may have had the most diverse work experience prior to his
Turtle time. He was a founding member of the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, serving on the original membership and
rules board. He received his undergraduate degree from the U.S. Air
Force Academy and flew Air Rescue “Jolly Greens” in Vietnam.
Military service was instrumental in his development. He said,
“Combat forces you to be 100 percent ‘in the now.’ It changes your
DNA forever.”
Philip Lu, Turtle Class of 1984
In 2006, an interview was attempted with Philip Lu, now working as a
college teacher at Edgewood College in Wisconsin. He threw a curve
ball. Lu declined to be interviewed because he believed his confi den-
tiality agreement with Richard Dennis (which expired in the early
1990s) was still in force.

Jerry Parker, Turtle Class of 1983
Years ago, at my first meeting with Jerry Parker, before the allotted time
was up, I was quick enough (or dumb enough) to capitalize on the op-
portunity by asking him to confirm who won the Barings Bank sweep-
stakes when it imploded. He confirmed the winner. That was the type
of confirmation that allowed me to write my fi rst book, Trend Follow-
ing. Today, Parker continues on as hands- down the most successful
Turtle. He still works out of his suburban Richmond, Virginia, offi ce.
Paul Rabar, Turtle Class of 1984
Paul Rabar, the second most successful Turtle managing money for
clients, theorized as to why some Turtles were more successful than
others: “Perhaps some of the others have preferred to focus less on busi-
ness management.”4
Rabar actually ran his own version of the Richard Dennis’s original
1983 want ad in the New York Times for new hires. And a recent online
search produced not the old ad, but a 2006 one from the Times. Whin-
ers making excuses that they were never afforded a foot in the door in
their lifetime, should look harder.
Tom Shanks, Turtle Class of 1984
Tom Shanks appears to have had the most fun as a Turtle. One of his
Turtle peers recalled a Las Vegas Turtle reunion years back when
Shanks showed up with a well- known sitcom actress on his arm.
Bradley Rotter saw up close the adventurous side of Shanks: “I re-
member he bought a jet helicopter, and was learning to fly it and
wanted to take me out on one of his maiden missions. He said we were
going to fly underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. I said as a matter of
principle, I try not to fl y with traders at the wheel.” Rotter turned seri-
ous in the next breath. “He is one of the finest individuals that I have
ever met. He has unquestionable discipline.”
Shanks is proudest of his first client. That investor put in $300,000
in 1988. Despite redemptions of more than $1 million, the client’s ac-
count has grown, without further additions, to over $18 million.5

Michael Shannon, Turtle Class of 1984
Michael Shannon’s career after the Turtles brought him into contact
with some of Wall Street’s biggest names. He worked on a fund with
legendary T-bond trader Thomas Baldwin (profi led in Market Wizards)
and later worked with Dr. Kaveh Alamouti (who would later run money
for Louis Bacon). Today, he enjoys a quiet life outside the United
States.
Jiri “George” Svoboda, Turtle Class of 1984
Jiri “George” Svoboda is a Turtle mystery. While he did initially regis-
ter with the National Futures Association (a government- sanctioned
regulatory body) to trade money for clients in 1988, the association
never actually granted him final registration, presumably because of
his 1988 felony convictions for producing false identifi cation docu-
ments and making a false statement in an application for a passport, as
well as his failure to disclose such felony convictions to the NFA.
Why a fake passport? As an accomplished card counter, Svoboda
was presumably searching for a way to play blackjack abroad and get
his winnings back into the States anonymously. This circumspect his-
tory aside, several of his peers had great praise for Svoboda; one even
said, “He’s a very practical person. He’s an extremely ethical and hon-
est person who lives in a very black and shades- of-g ray world.” And one
Turtle, who declined to be interviewed on the record, was a big fan of
Svoboda’s: “His performance is probably the best of all of the Turtles
since 1988.”
The Turtle grapevine did say that Svoboda has, over the years, pro-
vided advice to major Las Vegas casino owners on how to stop cheaters.
Beyond that, Svoboda remains an enigma—which is probably just how
he likes it.

Jerry Parker was not the only Turtle to assemble a continuous track re-
