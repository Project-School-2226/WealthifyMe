Richard W. Schabacker's great work, Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits, is a worthy
addition to any technical analyst's personal library or any market library. His "pioneering
research" represents one of the finest works ever produced on technical analysis, and this book
remains an example of the highest order of analytical quality and incisive trading wisdom.
Originally devised as a practical course for investors, it is as alive, vital and instructional today TTeecchhnniiccaall
as the day it was written. It paved the way for Robert Edwards and John Magee's best-selling
Technical Analysis of Stock Trends – a debt which is acknowledged in their foreword: 'Part One
is based in large part on the pioneer researches and writings of the late Richard Schabacker.'
AAnnaallyyssiiss
Schabacker presents technical analysis as a totally organized subject and comprehensively lays
out the various important patterns, formations, trends, support and resistance areas, and
associated supporting technical detail. He presents factors that can be confidently relied on, and aanndd
gives equal attention to the blemishes and weaknesses that can upset the best of analytical
forecasts. Factors which investors would do well to absorb and apply when undertaking the
fascinating game of price, time and volume analysis.

Richard Schabacker achieved his financial fame in the 1920s and 1930s. First as Financial Editor
of Forbes and later as Editor of The Annalist, a weekend section of the New York Times. During

this time he also authored three books. To many in the markets, who know of him, he is known
as "the father of technical analysis".

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Richard W. Schabacker
Richard W. Schabacker achieved his financial fame in the 1920s and 1930s first as
Financial Editor of Forbesand later as editor of the Annalist, a weekend section of the
New York Times. During this time he also authored three books: Stock Market Theory
and Practice, 1930; Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits, 1932; and Stock Market
Profits, 1934.
ABOUT THE SERIES EDITOR
Donald Mack
If any phrase describes the editor of the Traders’ Masterclass series, which is dedi-
cated solely to bringing back to traders and investors everywhere many of the great
and rare Technical Analysis classics from the past, that phrase would be “a perpet-
ual student of the market”. Students in high school or college eventually graduate.
Not so students of speculative markets. The study and the work is never finished,
especially when there is an enduring interest in Technical Analysis. The editor’s
interest grew by leaps and bounds when in the late 1970s and the 1980s he estab-
lished in Los Angeles the only bookstore in the USA that dealt exclusively in stock
and commodity books; those that were in print at the time and those that were out
of print. Current books were generally unchallenging and of various degrees of
quality. Many out-of-print books were also of varying degrees of quality, but so
many fascinating rare works from the 1920s to the 1950s, of great creativity and mar-
velous technical analytics and application came his way, that a life long appreciation
of their quality grew.
Almost needless to say, more attention was focused on the old books than on the
new, for he found those old books that made up the great classics were superior to
the new in so many ways. While operating the bookstore, there was a natural inflow
and outflow of many thousands of books and from those thousands of books a per-
sonal library and collection numbering a good 5,500 plus individual titles was put
together. A little of the knowledge contained in these great market classics rubbed
off on the editor (actually more than a little) and he trusts that it will also rub off on
the many market students of today and tomorrow as they also come in contact with
the superb Technical Analysis classics that will come their way through this Series.

Editor’s note
Because of the poor quality reproduction of the original charts it was found
necessary to re-draw each one. The vertical price bars on each chart were faithfully
reproduced as closely as possible to the original bars, in terms of size and date. The
horizontal bars (the Closing Price bars) proved troublesome and the decision was
made to insert them only when the author made specific reference to their position.
With there being no other references in the text concerning the other horizontal bars
on the charts, the closing price indications were superfluous and could be, and were,
safely omitted.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
“Part One is based in large part on the pioneer researches and writings of the late Richard W.
Schabacker. Students of his Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits (the latest revision of
which – now out of print – was made in 1937 by the present writer and Albert L. Kimball) will
find in the pages of this section much that is familiar and except for the illustrations, only a
little that is really novel”
From the Foreword to Technical Analysis of Stock Trends
by Robert D. Edwards and John Magee, 1948
To American technical analysts past, present, and future, the year 1948 stands out as
one of the brightest of beacons, bringing the solid foundations of modern Technical
Analysis. For it was this year that saw the publication of Technical Analysis of Stock
Trends, written by Messrs Edwards and Magee, which was the pivotal work in
launching Technical Analysis at a time that was to prove ready for it. Without a
doubt a great debt of gratitude has to be bestowed on the two authors and their
timely book which has sold some 800,000 plus copies and in later years has earned
for itself the accolade of “the bible of Technical Analysis.” A check with most dedi-
cated technical analysts who have learned their craft since 1948 would confirm their
personal debt to this work, which was responsible for introducing them to Techni-
cal Analysis or expanding their technical education.
But how did all of this come about? Technical Analysis certainly did not have a
long history of acceptance in the 1940s and before by the established investment fra-
ternity in New York, London, Paris and elsewhere. Without a doubt it was easier to
keep to long held beliefs that this form of analysis, utilizing charts of share price
action, was more akin to mumbo-jumbo than to the accepted seemingly logical
approach built around the respectable tools of Fundamental Analysis. To value a
company it was enough to analyze its accounts, work out its p/e ratio, be aware of
its research developments, weigh up its reported sales figures, estimate future
prospects, etc., thus arriving at a basis to value the company in terms of its share
price. Comparing that with the technical analyst’s toolbox containing charts, hori-
zontal, vertical, angular and squiggly lines, fanciful looking patterns, pictured for-
mations, plus indicators, oscillators and the like, logical investment thinking easily
came to the conclusion that Technical Analysis was a pseudo-scientific approach
that basically relied on price, time, and volume numbers, and paid little or no atten-
tion to the company itself. In comparison, accepted serious investment analysis con-
centrated on the company’s important fundamentals, for it was considered that in

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
these lay the only real basis for valuing a company’s share price in the trading mar-
kets, which to fundamental analysts is what investing is about.
Looking back now, it is easy to see that the post-World War II period investment
scene was ripe for new thinking not contrary to, but in addition to, the established
fundamental approach that relied heavily on the work that flowed out of the large
brokerage firms’ research departments to their customers. Filling that vacuum
knowingly or unknowingly, Messrs Edwards and Magee produced their timely and
technically definitive book which not only gave organized form and shape to the
field of Technical Analysis, but also gave rise to new analytical thought that the post-
war age could substantially make use of as an efficient methodology for investment
timing and selection. In the years prior to the publication of their influential Techni-
cal Analysis of Stock Trends, it should not go unnoticed, however, that many books
were published that can certainly be described as outstanding technical works
encompassing many phases of this analytical technology and thinking. A good
number of these books and courses were as original and as technically advanced as
anything on the subject of Technical Analysis that has been published since; great
technical thinking is just that whether it is expressed in 1920, 1940, 1997 or at any
other time. Such is the case with this book by Schabacker, for it, like many of the
great works of the past, is a worthy addition to any technical analyst’s personal
library or any market library. It is our belief that such great classics with their time-
less analytical knowledge should never be allowed to disappear from the technical
scene, if possible. It is to this end that Pitman Publishing, publishers of this Master
Class Series, will be making many of these very rare works available again with an
increasing number of additions to this series of great classical writings from the
“Golden Age of Technical Analysis,” that very productive period between 1922 and
1957.
Returning to the post-World War II period, it would appear the investment world
was open to that one vital analytical work turning up to give this recovery period a
boost. History has shown that Edwards and Magee were the boost-givers. Delving
into their book we find it is divided into two main parts; Part One forms the bulk of
the book and contains the main subject matter which is the descriptions contributed
by Mr Edwards in his coverage on reversal, consolidation, and continuation pat-
terns, trends, trend line action, support and resistance levels, and other areas of tech-
nical price action. The shorter Part Two by Mr Magee concentrates on the practical
applications of what to do in the markets and when. While Part Two includes much
in the way of general investment and trading knowledge that has been covered in
many books before and since, it is Part One that made the difference in 1948. In Part
One both private investors and professional analysts were presented with a com-
pendium of chart patterns, formations, and technical action. If they had studied con-
scientiously and applied the knowledge extensively, they would have had some

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
excellent tools at hand to analyze skillfully any chart that they scrutinized in the
light of the tenets of Technical Analysis.
As fine and comprehensive as the Edwards and Magee work is, a careful reading
of the introduction and similar statements on the book’s cover reveals their debt to
Mr Schabacker. Their candor and honesty is to be admired for they freely state that
they did not develop or create the many facets of Technical Analysis which they
were passing on to a new generation. What their excellent work did accomplish was
to save for posterity the vital creative and developmental work of their guiding light
who had passed away some ten years earlier, and in so doing they educated many
thousands in this new-to-them art of chart analysis. This takes us to a name now
unknown to almost all Technical Analysis devotees and cognoscenti around the
globe, the mentor of Edwards and Magee, Richard W. Schabacker. For it was from
Schabacker’s “pioneering research,” as pointed out by Edwards, that the monu-
mental concepts and ideas which emerged in this book Technical Analysis and Stock
Market Profits: A Course in Forecastingcame, and have proven to be the foundation of
modern Technical Analysis. It is certainly this writer’s opinion that this Course by
Schabacker represents the finest work ever produced on conventional Technical
Analysis. The qualifying word “conventional” is inserted because it must be used in
comparison to the work of William D. Gann who was equally as great, but more in
terms of the “unconventional” technical approach with which he is associated.
It seems almost unbelievable that such remarkable writings could have remained
unknown to the investment public for so long. Other than Edwards in his introduc-
tion to Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, we know of no other reference to it. Market
students should be aware of how this happened, as it is a too familiar story that
equally applies to a great number of other superb technical works that also remain
almost unknown today; an unwelcome fate that leaves the Technical Analysis fra-
ternity much the poorer. However, before going into the historical reasons and
developments that resulted in the dearth of classical Technical Analysis writings
that has haunted the field for many years, it would be well to take a closer look at
this classical work by Schabacker which remains an example of the highest order of
analytical quality and incisive technical thought, and should serve as an ideal to
technical students everywhere.
The Schabacker stock market story centers around the time of his financial edi-
torship activities with Forbes Magazine and later as editor for the Annalist weekly
publication that accompanied the New York Times. In 1930 Mr Schabacker wrote his
first book Stock Market Theory and Practice, a task that then firmly established his
investment literary credentials. It was an odd book in its own way. For a start it was
quite a thick book, some 800 plus pages long. Two-thirds of these pages were
involved with describing such pedantic subjects as to the functions of stockbrokers
in the market place, the paths the buy and sells orders take to reach the various

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
exchanges, details about these many exchanges, how orders are handled when they
come in and so on. Certainly these are not very exciting subjects, and for us today,
even less exciting, as the computer has changed many of the mechanical aspects of
buying and selling that the brokerage offices and exchanges used to rely on to
accomplish their tasks. It is the remaining third of the book that was destined to
greatly heighten our interest. For it is here that the author for the first time in mem-
ory presented Technical Analysis as a totally organized subject wherein he compre-
hensively laid out the various important patterns, formations, trends, support and
resistance areas, and associated supporting technical detail.
Just two years later, in 1932, came the publication of the first edition of this work.
We can only surmise why the author felt he had to publish a second work of a sim-
ilar nature to the one he had written two years earlier. We have to think that while
he must have felt the earlier book with its 250-plus pages devoted to technical sub-
jects gave good coverage of what he wanted to say, he had come to the conclusion
that there was a great deal more he could expound on to advance Technical Analy-
sis as a serious analytical approach in investment thinking, a more comprehensive
presentation worthy of the subject. The end result was this Course and masterpiece
that we now can say was well in keeping with his later recognition as “the father of
modern Technical Analysis.” Nevertheless, most technical analysts today still
remain unaware of Mr Schabacker’s place in the order of things or his contributions
to what is now the most popular form of investment analysis, Technical Analysis.
However, with this re-publishing of Schabacker’s finest writings, it is hoped an
awakening appreciation will sweep the cobwebs of anonymity away from this
extremely important contributor to our world of analytical thought and application.
For any trader or investor, from the rankest beginner to the most experienced
institutional fund manager, the most critical point that lies at the heart of any invest-
ment position they hold is when they find they have to ask themselves as the trend
evolves whether that position is at a peak with a possible reversal in the offing or, as
the case may be, at a bottom and a possible reversal in that price movement.
Depending on whether they are taking a long-term, a more intermediate-term, or a
short-term view (and they are all relative in respect to time), that change of trend
could make a vital difference to a profit gained or a loss sustained for that position.
This would also hold true for any buying decision or short sale decision being con-
sidered as the price action goes through its upside/downside contortions. For this
reason Mr Schabacker chose to make Reversal Patterns the area he would give the
greatest emphasis and attention to in the Course, and in so doing stressed the impor-
tance of this knowledge in the education of technical students, who see themselves
as intertwined in the dynamics of the marketplace. (In truth we who see ourselves
as students of the market know we are destined to attend Analysis University for as
long we are market-oriented. With the potential pool of knowledge that is there to

be explored, and our time on this planet so relatively limited, there can never be an
end to our learning experience. The only possible graduation ceremony we can
expect from our University has to be when we graduate to those Great Stock and
Commodity Markets in the Sky.)
In surveying the broad range of Reversal Patterns to be covered in the Course, the
initial formation the Author chose and the obvious one to feature was the one that
most exemplified reversal indications, the Head and Shoulders Formation and the
many variations of its basic construction. His first description centers on its ideal-
ized construction (as is the case when initially describing patterns and formations to
be seen on the charts. That they have to be “generally” described can be taken for
granted, as any description is normally started with an idealized version first. How-
ever, this must of necessity be tempered with the student’s realization that as in
nature, so is it in the reality of any patterned price movement, nothing repeats itself
“exactly.”) Following this introduction to the price formation or action that he is pre-
senting as he typically does throughout the Course, he presents those factors that
can be confidently relied on, and gives equal attention to the blemishes, the weak-
nesses, and numerous things that can upset the best of analytical forecasts. Certainly
the thinking here was not to make analysis difficult (it always is anyway), but really
to prepare the student’s analytical thinking to see that price is always moving into
the unknown as is its nature, challenging the student’s mind to be more acutely
tuned into looking at other important things that can also give clues to the resultant
move out of the pattern that has been noted. One of the most important things that
the author especially stresses is the paying of close attention to the Volume factor
(too often ignored even by experienced technical analysts, as it is admittedly very
difficult to get a handle on) as to whether it is increasing, decreasing, or standing still
in relation to the rising and falling price movements at the time. In keeping with his
instructive pattern descriptions of the Head and Shoulders, Schabacker similarly
covers the other Reversal Formations to be found described in the text, the Round-
ing Turn, the Symmetrical, Right-angle, Descending, Ascending, and Inverted Tri-
angles, Broadening Tops, Diamond Formations, Rectangles, Island Reversals, and
the others. Lest it might be thought that all these pattern descriptions are straight-
forward there is no lack of attention paid to the possibly troublesome deviation
details in the appearance of each formation’s structure.
Following the descriptive details in the chapters on the Reversal Formations, the
next series of patterns demanding attention are the Continuation Formations. When
they live up to their name, which is fairly often, these portray resting places along
the trend where they gather strength to continue upwards or downwards as the
prior trend dictates if it remains intact. They are generally also very recognizable, for
in the patterns found in this group their names are closely related to their shapes like
the Flag, the Pennant, the Rectangle, and again various shapes of Triangles. Since

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
Continuation Formations occasionally turn into Reversal Formations, they can at
times be the bane of the chart analyst; however, in any action in the marketplace at
any time, the market is going to do what the market is going to do and it does not
pay to fight it. Or as has been wisely said before, markets will do whatever they have
to do to prove the majority of participants wrong most of the time. Again, the author
puts in all his descriptions those fine points that the trader/investor would do well
to absorb and apply for the kind of help he or she needs when undertaking the fas-
cinating game of price, time and volume analysis.
With the same thorough attention given to the many facets of the Reversal and
Continuation Formations, the following chapters are replete with descriptions of
other technical action on the Break-away, Continuation, Common, and Exhaustion
Gaps, the Horn Formation, the Zig-zag Movement, the Trend, Trendlines, Channels,
Support and Resistance Lines and Levels, and several others. Additionally in Mr
Schabacker’s eyes Volume of sales was vitally associated with much of the action on
the charts (something that many modern technical writers treat much too broadly,
and even more importantly, too lightly.) Adding to his many references throughout
the book to Volume, to give this subject the attention the marketplace demands he
devotes a separate section solely to it, to emphasize its importance in price action
analysis. Another tool that technical analysts have in their armory is the means, at
times, to apply measuring rules to estimate the next probable move in price terms,
definitely rules that should not go unlearned. One problem that seems to plague
technicians over and over again is False Moves and Shake-outs, where it becomes
very difficult at times to distinguish what appears to be from what actually is,
actions guaranteed to see capital lost time after time. Again, Mr Schabacker’s cover-
age of what can be very scary moves when they turn up is masterly and worthy of
the great technical mind as he explores the subject; even to the extent that he points
out the “bright side of False Moves.”
But should this work really be ranked among the greatest stock and commodity
market technical literature ever, especially as it was written 70 years ago? Have we
not made tremendous advancements in Technical Analysis, especially with com-
puter technology, that surely dwarfs the knowledge of these so-called “great market
minds” of the past? The answer is a resounding “No” in this writer’s opinion and in
the minds of many other students of the market too. Basically markets have not
changed and the people who make up these markets have not changed one iota
either. Share and commodity prices still move either up, down or sideways in their
own ways. Charts from today could be mixed with charts from any time in the past,
and were all name and time indications removed, no one would be able to say which
were which. People today are no different from people of yesterday in their hopes,
their fears, their aspirations, their psychological make-ups and any other way one
wishes to look at them. For this series editor William D. Gann, on the basis of the

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
knowledge he has passed down to us, was and still is the finest analytical mind that
has ever been produced in speculative markets anywhere. Ever since his passing in
1955 efforts have been made to denigrate his name and his accomplishments (cer-
tainly an easy thing to do when his detractors only have the ability to take in the sur-
face meanings of his writings, totally lacking the realization of the depth of meaning
underneath these same writings). He did not make it easy for those who choose to
delve into his work, something he could not do and would not do.
There can be no running away from the realization that the primary purpose of
stock and commodity markets, whether they are those of yesterday, today or tomor-
row, is solely buying and selling. Anyone who excelled in their analytics and their
trading in markets past with whatever tools and approaches they successfully used
in their time, they would be equally at home trading and investing today; buying
and selling in speculative markets hasn’t changed one bit making time immaterial.
So it is with the Schabacker Course here. It is as alive, vital, and instructional today
as the day it was written and will be for the foreseeable future. Yet, for practically all
this time it has remained almost totally unknown, except for the short reference to it
in Edwards and Magee. And, this reference was easily passed over, since copies
of the Schabacker work were so rare. The question that always arises is how could
such an important and exceptional work as this one remain so unknown in a field
that attracts a great deal of studying and experimenting, where self-education is
basically the only learning process. A field where those who are serious students
are aware that they have only to look at the works of W. D. Gann, R. N. Elliott,
R. D. Wyckoff, and others from the past for technique and application that is as cur-
rent as anything available in the Technical Analysis field. The answer to this partic-
ular question lies in the physical printing methods available at the time of
publication.
For an explanation we have to look at the tough times of the 1930s in the USA
when financial conditions were difficult. Market books were still printed and
bought, even if in smaller numbers than in the preceding “Roaring Twenties,” and
at prices that reflected the troubled business climate of the time. In the investment
publishing field there was a relatively small market with lucrative prospects that
could be tapped, and where opportunity arose, many authors were prepared to offer
material that a number of traders and investors would buy. This area of opportunity
lay in producing worthy works that promised finer trading systems, methodologies,
analytical thought, and increased forecasting potential, the study of which would
help the reader to reap larger profits in the trading and investment markets. To
attract this business, authors produced large technical courses which they sold
directly to the ultimate purchaser at a premium price, sending one chapter at a fixed
price for a specified time period, say one chapter a month for $25 per chapter, until
the whole course had been received. An embossed cover was usually sent with the

last chapter, and the course was complete. The recipient usually had the opportunity
to direct questions later to the author on the course material.
The full title of this book by Mr Schabacker is Technical Analysis and Stock Market
Profits: A Course in Forecasting. We can be certain from the title that it was a course,
and that the author intended to publish and distribute it as mentioned previously.
Obviously, the number of courses that would be sold, especially in the light of the
high premium charged, was going to be relatively small. There was also a physical
reason that limited the numbers printed and sold; the printing method that had to
be used. Before the photocopier became a reality, the normal method of reproducing
text on paper, where printing press production was not economical, was by means
of the mimeograph process (known by other names in countries outside the USA.)
Here a specially treated plate containing the typewritten text was placed around a
large metal cylinder which in turn was rotated by hand or motor to produce a
printed page. The printed pages would then be collated into chapters and the chap-
ters sent out to the purchasing students. The one problem that arose in the printing
process was with the plate containing the typewritten text because the pressure on
this plate eventually broke down the letters of the text. This meant that rarely could
more than about 1,000 copies be printed from any plate and still be legible.
We know that there were two editions of this Schabacker Course, one in 1932 and
the other in 1937 (which is this book); and at approximately 1,000 copies each, it is
not hard to see that, with time taking its toll on these original editions over the past
years, only a relative handful have survived. Even in 1948 when Edwards and
Magee produced their fine book, knowledge of the original Schabacker Course must
have been fading. That there were special reasons and conditions which limited its
numbers can be appreciated, and, in turn, it is easy to see why, in the light of a
knowledge of the times and the special market this Course was distributed to, it was
almost inevitable that the odds were not good that it would survive the years. While
the survival of this Technical Analysis masterpiece could have been in doubt, with
this publication we have to feel that its depth of knowledge on its chosen subject, its
clarity of expression in describing random, undulating price movements, and its
evident excellence of intricate technical evolutionary revelation make the effort to
bring it back to the analytical community worth it. If the coming years lead to a uni-
versal acceptance of just how superb this Course is in its field of specialization, then
we will truly be able to say that there is a new “bible of Technical Analysis” –
Richard W. Schabacker’s Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION
The preparation of this Course in twelve lessons, or studies, on the technical
approach to successful trading in stocks, comes in answer to a definite and insistent
demand from many students for assistance in stock chart work and market analysis.
Some of these students are new to the game, beginners who wish seriously to pre-
pare themselves for an active market career, or who want to study it thoroughly
before deciding to enter it actively. Another large group is made up of those who
have had more or less experience in the market, trading on either their own
“hunches” or the advice and tips of others, and have come to realize that a great deal
of money can be made in the market but not by hit-or-miss methods, and certainly
not by following blindly the lead of others.
A third group consists of experienced and often very successful traders and
investors who know the importance of correctly evaluating the technical side of the
market in order to time their operations for maximum profits.
And, finally, there are always those individuals who are seeking an easy key, a
magic formula that will take them to riches without effort.
For the class last named this Course is definitely not intended. There is no “magic
key” to stock market profits. The founder of the Schabacker methods of technical
forecasting in his many years of research, with the facilities of large financial and
investigative organizations, tested literally hundreds of “systems” and formulas –
not only on paper but in actual market operations – and found no dependable short
cuts, no systems that can take the place of careful, constant application of the prin-
ciples of technical analysis.
(It may well be said at this point, however, that research along promising lines has
never stopped and never will. This science is not static, though the fundamental law
of supply and demand which it seeks to interpret can never be repealed. This Course
today incorporates several amplifications and refinements which have come
through the “acid test” since it was first organized.)
So, to the hopeful seeker for an easy answer, we can say only this: You will get out
of this study only what you are willing to put into it and continue to put into it for
as long as you trade in the security markets.
But the earnest student of the science need have no misgivings. Every effort has
been made – with reasonable success, we believe – to make each point and each
method taught herein clear to understand and thoroughly practicable. Complicating
and, in some cases, highly publicized theories which exhaustive tests have shown to
offer results not commensurate with the time and expense their practice entails,

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION
have been avoided. Instead, the effort has been to explore and to teach the basic prin-
ciples and the methods which any man can apply in his spare time, and without the
necessity of paying to others a continuing toll for statistical or advisory services.
In brief, this Course is organized to serve the average man who can devote only
an hour or so a day, and perhaps only a few hundred dollars, to his market oper-
ations, as well as the professional full-time trader.
Also, it has been our endeavor to make the student independent in thought. For
it is unquestionably true that no man has ever, over any period of time, made and
kept stock market profits unless he has developed the qualities of independent judg-
ment and action. This course of study is designed to enable you to see the opportu-
nities for yourself, to decide the questions of “what” and “when” for yourself, and
then to act with confidence.
The average man of intelligence who brings sober study and application to his
market analyses can – as we have ample proof – find dependable profits in the stock
market, year in and year out, through bear markets as well as bull. He will not suf-
fer the crippling losses that came to thousands, incredibly enough, even in the wild
bull market of 1928–29. And he will discover the interesting truth that trading in
stocks is the one and only business activity in which money can be made just as well
in times of general business decline as during boom periods.

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
Definition of a Stock Chart
There is perhaps no better way to begin a discussion of stock charts than to agree on
a definition for them. A stock chart is a pictorial record of the trading history of any
stock or group of stocks. This is a perfectly simple definition of our subject yet it is
general enough to cover all of the many charts, pictures and formations which we
shall discuss in subsequent pages.
A stock chart may conceivably be so simple a thing as the picture of the closing
price of one stock issue on the last trading day of each year for only five or ten years.
The picture would not mean a great deal, yet technically it would fit into our defin-
ition. It would be a pictorial record of the trading history of this stock. It would be a
stock chart. It would differ only in degree from the most complete, most detailed
and painstaking stock chart that we might construct.
An ‘‘Advanced Course’’
For the purposes of this study it will be necessary to assume that the reader is quite
familiar with stocks, with securities in general, with the theory and practice of open-
market trading and with all of the myriad technical details covered by our term
‘‘trading history.” To this extent our present study is somewhat of an ‘‘advanced
course’’ in stock market operation, and it is only fair to suggest that fundamentals of
the market be studied and mastered before undertaking to benefit from this course.1
Beyond this introductory generalization, however, it shall be our constant and
continued aim to be as certain as possible that our thought is made clear by sim-
plicity of language, by constant stressing of important points, by myriad examples
and even by possibly tiresome repetition. And it will perhaps be necessary to
request the forbearance and indulgence of our ‘‘brighter pupils’’ or more experi-
enced readers if they find us apparently verging on ‘‘complete recall’’ in order to be
certain of full understanding.
As an example of this possible fault we are constrained to return for a few
moments to a more detailed examination of our introductory definition of stock
charts. The stock chart is a pictorial representation of any stock’s trading history. In
the study of stock charts we are not primarily interested in anything but actual trad-

NY. (Referring to this particular work is not possible, as it has long been out of print. With the passage of
time many market fundamentals have totally changed. Any reader needing information on the opera-
tions and fundamentals of current markets will certainly find this available in the many books that cover
these subjects today.)

ing – that is, the record or result of the orderly buying and selling of any issue in the
course of actual trading on any open market.
Pure Technical Action
We are not interested, for example, in the company behind the stock which we are
studying. We do not care, for our immediate purpose, whether the corporation man-
ufactures mousetraps, tin cans, locomotives or aluminum toothpicks. We are not
particular as to whether it is an industrial, a railroad, a utility or a what-not. Techni-
cally the company behind the stock might even be in receivership, with its plant shut
down entirely and making nothing at all. For our primary purpose of charting that
stock it would make no difference, so long as the stock itself continued to enjoy fairly
active trading in some orderly and well regulated open market security exchange.
The reader must not get the impression that such fundamental factors are unim-
portant in trading, in analysis, in forecasting. They most decidedly are and they
most decidedly should be taken into serious consideration when studying any stock
or any stock chart for practical purposes. We merely assert that the stock chart itself
has nothing to do with such fundamental factors. It concerns itself solely with the
stock’s actual record in open-market trading.
Fundamentals Reflected in Technical Action
In the record of such trading all of these many and varied fundamental factors are
brought to bear, are evaluated and automatically weighted and recorded in net bal-
ance on the stock chart.
The trading in any stock is largely the result of the influence these fundamental
factors have had on each buyer and seller of each share of stock. The stock chart is a
pictorial record of such trading, so that it, in itself, is a reflection of all those other
factors and, from a purely technical standpoint, need therefore concern itself no fur-
ther with such fundamental considerations.
Stocks Eligible for Charting
And, incidentally, since a stock chart is merely a record of trading, it follows that any
stock is eligible for charting which enjoys a trading market. Any stock, and for that
matter any article or service, which is bought and sold for a publicly listed price, can
be charted. For practical purposes, we shall see later that in order to be a valuable
subject for study a stock should have a free and open market, and an active market,
but the fact remains that any traded stock can be pictorialized in a stock chart.
And in like manner, according to our definition, a stock chart may be constructed

==================================================

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
for more-than one stock at a time. Any number of stocks may be included in a sin-
gle stock chart though the clearest results are obtained by averaging all of the com-
ponent stocks or figures into one series and thus making the chart into a composite
picture which looks like the record of trading in merely one stock, but, in reality, is
the composite result of trading in a great many stocks combined. Such composite
charts on groups of stocks are called ‘‘averages.”
Proceeding further with our definition of a stock chart we note that it is primarily
a pictorial record. A stock chart then is a picture. One of the most simple and easily
understandable advantages of a stock chart is that it presents a picture at any desired
instant of stock history which has covered many months or years and which, in the
absence of the chart, it would take many hours, or even weeks, of diligent research
to produce.
The Pictorial Aspect of Charts
Since the stock chart is a history of trading it finds its primary basis of construction
in actual trading, and in the units of such trading. The most common and accepted
trading place in stocks is the New York Stock Exchange. The results of trading on
that exchange are primarily recorded in brokerage offices throughout the country
through the medium of the stock ticker. But for many apparent and practical reasons
the majority of people interested in such trading are not able to be in personal atten-
dance to watch the trading record unfold itself in a brokerage office from 10 to 3
o’clock each day.2 The newspapers and other periodicals and services bridge this
gap by reporting daily the results of such trading. Any person interested in the stock
market, therefore, may save approximately five hours a day by examining merely
the total results of the day’s trading.
Just as the newspapers save time and energy by summarizing stock trading each
day, so the stock chart goes further in its service by saving days, weeks, months and
years for the interested student. If he wishes to review the past year of trading his-
tory for any stock without reference to a chart, he must go back over the newspapers
for more than 300 days or, at best, his own records summarizing those 300 days of
trading. But if he takes advantage of the services offered by the stock chart he may
save all this time and effort. At a glance he may have before him the complete record
of the past year’s daily trading in any particular stock.
Charts as the ‘‘Complete Memory’’
Even if there were no saving of time and effort, stock charts still retain their greatest

advantage, however, which is one of complete memory. If the individual were satis-
fied to spend his precious hours poring over the written or printed record of the past
year’s trading in any stock, as presumed above, he would still be under a terrific
handicap of trying to remember the characteristics of February trading while look-
ing at the record for October. Unless he had an almost supernatural memory he
would have to be constantly referring from one period of time to another in order to
make any complete order or analysis out of his research.
But if he uses a chart of this stock, how much simpler is his task. Here is the pic-
ture, before his eyes in black and white, permanent, accurate, compact – the very pic-
ture which, without the chart, he would be trying hazily to recollect or construct in
mental imagery.
The stock chart’s chief value, therefore, grows out of its being a pictorial record of
trading history. Because it is a picture the stock chart makes the past history of any
issue an open book, simple, easy to read, easy to study. Its use brings advantages
similar in practical result to the telescope, the X-ray, the electric eye and other mod-
ern devices which save so much time and energy in fundamentals and details that
they make possible the transference of such energy into the more productive chan-
nels of study and research.
Technical Chart Action – the New Science
And this thought brings us naturally to by far the greatest practical advantage of the
stock chart. Because it makes the groundwork of fundamental co-ordination of facts
so easy, so simple, so readily grasped, it leads naturally into a more detailed study
of the phenomena which it pictorializes; the actual results of the trading history pre-
sented, the patterns, the rules, the characteristics of behavior. In short, it leads to a
new science, the science of technical chart action.
Technical market action is that aspect of analysis which is based upon phenomena
arising out of the market itself, to the exclusion of fundamental and all other factors.
In fact, technical action may also be explained as merely the antithesis of the funda-
mental considerations. The fundamental aspect of market analysis lays special stress
upon such factors as the corporation behind the stock, its business, its prospects, its
past, present and future earnings, its balance sheet, its financial strength, the quality
of its management and so on. Fundamental factors include the dividend rate of the
stock in question, its capitalization, its yield, its distribution and countless other fac-
tors which may have direct or indirect bearing upon the intrinsic worth of the stock,
upon its theoretical price, upon what the individual may think it should sell for, or
upon the true value of the issue in question.
Such fundamental factors are highly important and must be taken into careful
consideration by the investor or trader. But they are not the technical factors which

==================================================

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
we are about to study. The technical factors are what might be termed the residuum
of the total sum of all aspects bearing upon the probable market value of the stock,
after the more apparent and fundamental factors are eliminated.
Technical vs. Fundamental Factors
When we have finished our fundamental analysis of earnings, financial strength and
all the rest, there is still something left to be considered with regard to the future
price at which any particular stock may sell. That final consideration has to do with
technical market action.
Realizing the presence and the importance of this ‘‘other factor’’ makes it more
simple to analyze it. We have defined technical action as the phenomena arising out
of the market itself. That market is nothing more than a group of buyers pitted
against a group of sellers. And it stands clearly to reason that in any open market if
there were more sellers than buyers, or more shares of stock for sale than for pur-
chase, then the quotations or prices for that stock would decline.
Ours not to reason why there was more stock offered than the demand could sus-
tain. Ours merely to detect the technical fact that there were more sellers than buy-
ers. That was the important point, for it meant the stock was going down, all
fundamental factors to the contrary notwithstanding.
Such considerations form the basis for our statement at the beginning of this chap-
ter that stock charts, and thus also technical action, take no consideration of funda-
mental factors like earnings, management, balance sheets and so forth, in their
primary analysis. We shall see later that fundamentals are highly important adjuncts
to the study of technical action and are, in many cases, more important for the long
pull than are the temporary technical aspects. But in our introduction to the subject
and for our basic understanding of stock charts we must realize that in themselves
they completely ignore fundamentals. In fact they completely ignore everything
except technical market action, the balance between buyers and sellers, the balance
between supply and demand for any stock or group of stocks; in short the phenom-
ena arising out of actual trading, per se, in a free and open market.
Reasons for Contrary Technical Action
Perhaps it is too mysterious and suggestive of legerdemain to intimate that we need
not question why a stock suddenly declines on weak technical action just when its
fundamental aspects appear the strongest. There are many possible reasons, but
they arise, like the technical action itself, primarily out of the market.
Speculators may have bought the stock months ago in anticipation of the devel-
opment of these favorable fundamentals, and as they appear the speculators sell out

and take their profits. Perhaps a group of powerful insiders, or officials of the com-
pany, have loaded up too heavily with the stock. Perhaps they realize that the fun-
damental situation is not as strong as the news makes it appear. There are any
number of reasons why the technical position may be the opposite of the funda-
mental position.
The important point is that when they are at variance, the technical position wins
out, since it is closer to the market, and the open
market is what makes stock prices move. At least
The technical position is
the technical position wins out immediately, even if
the factor which is going
only temporarily, and the technical position is there-
to influence prices up or
fore more important than the fundamental position
down in the future
for the short-swing trader or speculator who is look-
ing for his profit from the current price movement
of the stock and is not, like the investor, buying to put away for the ‘‘long pull.”
Although through the medium of stock charts we can get a better judgment on the
technical position of the market at the moment, that technical position is constantly
changing and is subject to very rapid and substantial swings from very strong to
very weak in a few days or even, at rare intervals, in a few hours. It takes practically
no time at all for a huge lot of buying or selling to come into the market and such
events are reflected in technical action and lend themselves to chart analysis.
The fact is, however, that technical action does not generally change so rapidly
and, having determined whether the technical position is strong or weak, we are a
little ahead of the game already, because the technical position is the factor which is
going to influence prices either up or down not yesterday, or even now, but in the
future, even though it be only the immediate future.
Technical positions do not generally change rapidly unless fundamentals receive
a terrific impulse which is so strong as to overcome the ‘‘status quo’’ between sup-
ply and demand. In the general run of affairs a strong technical position will take
days, weeks or months to build itself up, will have its strong effect for months, and
then will take additional days, weeks or months finally to exhaust itself and switch
to the opposite state of weak technical position. During all this gradual change, mar-
ket profits are available through proper analysis of the technical situation.
Summary of the Technical Approach
To summarize our introductory discussion, it is not enough to know the fundamen-
tal position of stocks. We must also know their technical position. For the short
range, technical considerations are even more important than fundamental statis-
tics, but ‘‘the compleat angler’’ will know both. Fundamental considerations are
easy for the average student. Technical aspects are not so easy or so certain but they

are reduced to somewhat of a science by the study of stock charts.
Through the medium of stock charts we may arrive at a better understanding of
the phenomena which attend the gradual but constantly shifting balance of power
between supply and demand in the stock market.
The Introductory Warning
The following lessons are devoted to such a study but in a spirit of broadminded-
ness and conservatism which it is highly important that the reader should share. If
there is one generalization about the whole subject of stock charts which we may
suggest at the very introduction of our study, it is the definite caution that the reader
be skeptical of any apparently sure thing. This may sound like a poor anticlimax
with which to open such a study but we do so with well-weighed forethought.
We are most definitely a firm believer in the usefulness of stock charts and their
high value in delineating the technical position of individual stocks and the general
market. Stock charts are, in our opinion, the most important single aid in forecasting
future price movements and we constantly stand on the reiterated premise that they
are an absolute necessity for successful stock trading.
Beware of Early Presumption
But it is this very faith in the efficiency of stock charts that leads to an introductory
warning against over confidence and mistrust. There is nothing like the thrill that
comes to the beginner when he once commences to
master the rudimentary principles of chart reading
and sees his first few forecast analyses turn out cor- Stock charts are most

involved in a disastrous quagmire of heavy losses
and, what is perhaps more important, in a hopeless state of indecision, mistrust,
skepticism, and bitter disappointment.

maiden success – whose cupidity was so sharpened by the early realization of the
basic value in technical analysis that they rushed headlong into the pitfalls of chart
reading and chart trading without displaying enough patience and forbearance to
complete their study and perfect their knowledge of basic principles.
The reader may be certain that all of the principles educed in the following study
of stock charts and technical action are considered valuable or important, or they
would not have been included. But the reader may also be just as certain that none
of those principles are guaranteed to be 100 per cent infallible. We have been able to
find, though sometimes with difficulty, exceptions to practically every formation, to
practically every rule. Furthermore, we know of no practical rule of stock charts or
stock trading which may not, under certain conditions and at certain times, have
such exceptions.
By no means the least important aspect of successful chart reading and chart trad-
ing, therefore, is the early detection of such exceptional cases, the almost intuitive,
subconscious suspicion of certain formations and, above all, the ability to avoid or
limit loss on such exceptional situations.
We have endeavored to suggest methods for attaining this happy state but, in the
last analysis, it comes generally from long study, from long experience and from
long foresight; and the greatest of these is the attitude which we are attempting to
foster in these paragraphs, that of a healthy skepticism toward all rules, a scholarly
spirit of conservatism and humility in the face of a great and valuable science and a
conservative habit of action in all practical market trading.
Newspapers which Publish Charts
Public and professional interest in stock charts has increased so rapidly in recent
years that the demand has led to a growing supply of sources from which stock
charts may be purchased ready made. Even some of the newspapers have begun to
publish individual stock charts, either in continuous series or merely from time to
time. Regular publication of stock charts in the newspapers is still confined gener-
ally, however, to the printing of ‘‘average charts,’’ or charts showing the pictorial his-
tory of leading stock groups, rather than individual issues.
Among the New York daily newspapers which publish average charts regularly
are the New York Daily Investment News and the Wall Street Journal.3 The Wall Street
Journalpublishes daily an up-to-date record of its own averages of 30 railroad issues,

mission of market data and chart representations make the type of information referred to in the text easy
to gather. Special note should be made that a number of organizations provide excellent weekly chart
books for stocks and commodities that many technical analysts find as essential today as in the 1930s.

30 industrials, 20 utilities and 40 bonds, in separate charts, and is the most valuable
daily publication for the perusal of charts already made.
The New York Daily Investment Newspublishes the long-range daily chart record of
a well-known average of 90 stocks. Most of these average charts also carry the daily
volume of sales on the New York Stock Exchange.
The New York Herald Tribunepublishes every morning the picture up to the previ-
ous day’s closing of its own highly respected average of 100 stocks. The New York
Timesalso prints every morning a chart of the Timesaverage of 50 stocks. The New
York Sun, among the evening papers, carries in its final editions a chart of its own
average of 50 stocks. And most of the other metropolitan newspapers of conserva-
tive appeal publish from time to time charts on a variety of financial and business
trends as well as stocks.
Magazines which Publish Charts
Magazines have been a little slower in keeping abreast of public interest in stock
charts but there are a number which carry regular charts on market averages. The
Magazine of Wall Street, published bi-weekly, is perhaps the best-known and carries
not only its own average chart, in which the prices of 295 common stocks are aver-
aged, but a variety of other financial charts as well. Forbes Magazinepublishes regu-
larly a long-term chart of weekly ranges on the New York Times, or Annalist, average,
showing for the past four or five years the course of the three Timesseries, the groups
including 25 industrials, 25 rails and the 50 industrials and rails combined in a
single index.
The Annalist, published weekly by the New York Times, shows these same averages
for a shorter space of time and also carries a very interesting series of comparative
charts showing averages of groups of the leading stocks in practically every impor-
tant field of industry. Barron’s, published weekly by Dow, Jones & Company, offers
approximately the same charts which the Wall Street Journal, published by the same
company, gives daily.
The New York Stock Exchange Bulletin, published monthly and sent free on appli-
cation, contains a great valuable fund of statistical information as well as many
charts on a great variety of financial and stock trends.
Services Selling Daily Charts
Such average charts are useful in gauging the trend of the general market but for the
sincere student who wants to make real progress in chart analysis for himself it is
mandatory to have at hand charts on individual stock issues, for they are the fun-
damental basis of all stock chart science.

STUDY I
The pioneer and probably best known publisher of ready-made stock charts is
Graphic Market Statistics, Inc., 11 Stone Street, New York City (estab. 1919). This
firm offers up-to-date daily or weekly (81/2″ ×11 ″) charts of all stocks listed on the
New York Curb or Stock Exchanges – daily back history being available from 1926,
or date of listing, and weekly from 1929.
This concern also publishes at regular intervals, in loose-leaf book form, a ‘‘Mas-
ter Unit’’ of over 500 daily, weekly and monthly charts (1924 to date) on 100 active
individual stocks and the better known market averages. For the student who
wishes to follow a fewer number of stocks, a similar record (‘‘set’’) is also available
in either of two groups of 50 active stocks each.
Although daily, weekly and monthly charts are, when considered together, very
valuable tools in the study of technical action, those who prefer may obtain separate
single books of daily, weekly or monthly charts on either of two standard lists of 50
stocks each.
Graphic Market Statistics, Inc. also designs and constructs to order security and
commodity charts of any size, type or period.
Ready-made Charts
Such services offering ready-made charts probably find their greatest subscription
demand from banks, brokerage houses and other financial organizations, though
the demand from individual subscribers has increased in recent years. There is no
objection to the student of stock charts subscribing to such services; in fact, we
advise it as the easiest and quickest way to get a group of one’s own stock charts
started.
A supply of these ready-made charts can get the student off to a running start for
they give him immediately the background of past action necessary for the proper
analysis of the current picture as it develops. From then on, however, we advise the
student to construct his own charts. He may continue to purchase ready-made
charts if he chooses, perhaps as a means of keeping in touch with the weekly or
monthly picture on a larger number of stocks than he can conveniently chart for
himself each day, but to rely entirely on ready-made charts encourages a superficial
attitude toward the entire subject. The method is too easy. This may sound like the
philosophy of an enemy of progress but the statement is true, nevertheless.
Advantages of Making Your Own Charts
Purely from a psychological standpoint, the student who gets a new set of charts
already made up for him periodically is almost certain to view them from a less
important angle than the man who is under absolute necessity of making them up
– 12–

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
for himself every day. Unless he is unusually gifted with determination and single-
ness of purpose the former is going to find himself pressed for time some morning
or some evening and either skim over them without study, or put them away with-
out looking at them at all. He may return to his conscientious study tomorrow but
then again he may not, and the first day of flagging interest makes the next one that
much easier.
But the man who makes up his own charts is in an entirely different psychologi-
cal position. He may be tempted to neglect his work on them for one day but he will
soon find that it is too difficult to ‘‘catch up’’ and he will make it a regular rule and
habit of his life to post up his (possibly ‘‘cursed’’) stock charts every single day.
Closer Personal Contact
Beside this psychological aspect, however, there is a much more practical advantage
to keeping up one’s own charts. That advantage emanates from keeping in constant
touch with each one of them every day. The man who has his charts before him
ready-made is quite likely to skip over all but a few of his temporary favorites and
thus fail to notice the development of important profitable signals in the remainder
of his series.
Not so with the student who keeps his own charts. He is forced by the rigor of his
undertaking to bestow a certain amount of time on each individual chart of his series
each day whether he happens to be especially interested in them all or not. Through
this forced, but none the less certain, closeness of contact with each single chart the
student who makes his own is much more likely to shift his study and watchful
attention to different charts in his series as each in turn develops more definite and
profitable pictures through the course of time.
Number of Charts Necessary
The first step for the student who is going to keep his own charts is to decide on the
number he wants to keep and the individual issues which will compose his port-
folio. For the average beginner who is not yet certain that he wants to give much
time and effort to his study, a group of perhaps 15 or 20 individual charts should be
sufficient for temporary trial. For the average trader who knows he is deeply inter-
ested in chart study and technical action a list of 50 to 100 individual charts is not too
many.
After a few months of experience, when the matter of keeping the series up to date
has become something of a routine matter, the student will be surprised with the
rapid progress he can make. Once in full swing he should not need much over 45
seconds per chart. He should be able to fill in a day’s trading history on 10 charts in

say 8 minutes, 50 charts in 40 minutes, 100 charts in 80 minutes and so on. If he is
blessed with either a wife, a secretary or a devoted what-not who can read the nec-
essary figures off to him from the daily papers, the time required can be more than
cut in half.
Selecting the Stocks
In selecting the individual issues to be charted, personal interest will naturally play
some part and the student’s ‘‘favorites’’ may be included. Other things being equal,
however, the most active and important stocks, like the ‘‘market leaders’’ lend them-
selves more suitably to chart study because they are most active, generally fluctuate
in more normal patterns, are more likely to be under almost constant ‘‘street’’ inter-
est, and usually show more clearly the trend of the general market.
It is also well to select stocks which have at least a fair-sized number of shares out-
standing. This makes for greater public interest, a more ready market, higher activ-
ity and generally clearer technical pictures.
The best results are gained in every way by setting aside one particular period of
time each day to make up one’s charts, preferably either before the market opens in
the morning or after it closes in the evening. The evening is better as a rule because
more time can then be given to leisurely study of the formations, the proper program
decided upon and, if actively trading, the brokerage orders may be sent in that
evening by mail.
Whatever the time decided upon, however, it is important for ultimate success that
the same time be adhered to steadfastly and by rule. There are so many reasons, so
many alibis, that can insinuate themselves into the time set apart for making up
charts that the program is almost hopeless unless it be made a matter of ironclad rule.
Chart Paper
The next step in starting one’s own portfolio of charts is to secure the proper and
necessary paper. There is room for a good deal of latitude in personal taste with
regard to this subject. Many chart students have their own pet types and makes of
chart paper and swear by none other. Most of the professional, services and chart
makers use a loose-leaf binder with paper measuring about 24′′ × 12′′, but the
average individual should find smaller sizes quite satisfactory, say the standard
81/2′′×11′′.
The smaller size has certain important advantages over the larger size because it
takes up less room, leaves less unused white space, can more easily be carried about
in a briefcase and can be more easily removed from the portfolio for individual han-
dling and study.

==================================================

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
The chief advantage claimed for the larger size paper is that new sheets are not
needed so often but, while this is true, there is also some advantage to the shorter
sheets which run out more quickly. When this happens the price scale can be moved
up or down on the new sheet so that the stock price range is not so likely to run off
the sheet before its completion with respect to time. And, for that reason also, it is
practicable to use on the smaller sheets a larger price scale which renders more con-
spicuous the technical patterns as they develop.
In any case, it is possible to put too much stress upon the correct type of paper.
This is a minor matter for just about any kind of paper will give satisfactory results
once the student becomes accustomed to using it and reading his own charts.
Co-ordinate Scales
About the only requisite for chart paper is that it must be ruled both horizontally
and vertically; i.e., what is generally termed co-ordinate paper. Up to the point of
confusion, the more lines in each direction the better. Some styles of co-ordinate
paper have a dated vertical line for each day of the year. This simplifies keeping
track of dates but it also distorts the picture at times, for it means that a space must
be left for regular and special holidays when there is no trading in the stock market.
Plain, standard, unlettered co-ordinate paper with rulings or ‘‘screen’’ of about 20
lines to the inch, both vertical and horizontal, is obtainable in most large stationery
stores and will serve perfectly well for all ordinary purposes. In our own work we
have found Keuffel & Esser’s No. 358-17 most practical of the special sheets pre-
pared for charting security prices; this comes in the standard 81/2′′ × 11′′ size,
punched for insertion in a ring binder, and has its horizontal scale divided in sixths
to represent the six days of the normal business week, and the vertical scale in
eighths to conform with the standard eighth of a point price differential in trading.
Their No. 358-17L has the same scaling but measures 11′′ × 161/2′′. The Keuffel
& Esser Company publishes a variety of other styles of chart paper and binders to
fit which the student may buy from them direct if he wishes, and which are
described in their catalog of co-ordinate papers obtainable on request from their
own stores in New York or Chicago, or from their general office at Hoboken, New
Jersey.
The Codex Book Company, Inc. of Norwood, Mass. also prints a large variety of
types and sizes of co-ordinate paper, making a specialty of stock chart sheets.
Constructing the Scale
Having obtained the proper co-ordinate paper and decided upon the individual

==================================================

STUDY I
stocks which it is desired to chart, the next step is to construct, the scale. The hori-
zontal lines on the paper are used to measure the price and volume, so that the actual
scales for these factors will be on the vertical lines, preferably at the left hand mar-
gin.
The price scale may be altered in many ways and will depend chiefly on the size
and ruling of the paper and on the extent of the stock’s normal range. If, for exam-
ple, we are using a sheet of ordinary co-ordinate paper with 20 lines each way to the
inch, and 10 inches high vertically, every inch, or every twentieth line, will generally
be found printed in heavier ink to serve as a guide. For the average stock selling
under 100 every heavy, inch, or twentieth, line on the vertical scale may be a unit of
five full points in the price of the stock. Thus each single line will be one-quarter of
a full point and the smaller fractional eighths of a point, will fall half way between
two lines.
When commencing a new chart it is well to glance back over the price range for
the past year and take the average price, say 65, as the price-mark for a heavy hori-
zontal line near the middle of the page on the vertical scale. The next heavy, twenti-
eth, or inch, line above will be 70, and the one below the first entry of 65 will be 60
and so on, as the vertical price scale is filled on the left-hand margin.
If the stock’s average range has been very large and its normal fluctuations are
wide then a larger price scale is in order. Each heavy, twentieth, or inch, line may be
marked to represent 10 points or even 20 points, making each horizontal line across
the sheet count for either a half point, or a full point, respectively. In such case it will
be more difficult to plot the fractions of a point but this detail of exactitude is not so
necessary for a satisfactory picture when the price swings are so large.
The same general principles apply if you are using a special stock chart paper such
as the K. & E. 358-17. For most stocks of average price range each heavy (eighth) line
on the vertical scale may be marked to represent a full point in the price and each
light line will then represent one-eighth of a point. For stocks with a wider swing or
higher price, such as American Can, AT & T. etc., each heavy line may represent two
points, and the fine lines one-quarter of a point; and for very low-priced stocks with
small swings, each heavy line may be marked to represent only half a point.
Plotting the Price Data
Having established the suitable price scale in the left-hand margin, the price-plot-
ting is simple. The daily paper furnishes the necessary data – high, low, close and
volume of sales. Plot the high, plot the low, and join the two points with a vertical
line to give the day’s range. The closing price is an important part of any complete
daily stock chart; it is noted by a short, fine, horizontal line, extending across the ver-
tical range line, just far enough to be noted.

                     PAGE 39                      
==================================================

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
Both opening and closing prices may, of course, be plotted if desired but we con-
sider practical only the plotting of closing prices. It is seldom that opening prices
show material change from the previous close and they are not nearly so important
as the closing or ‘‘last’’ price.
Moreover, we feel that what advantage is gained by including the first or opening
price is more than lost by the tendency toward confusion in trying to include too
much and thus impairing the basic picture. If both the opening and closing are plot-
ted then the opening price is noted by a horizontal mark to the left of the day’s range
and the closing price by a similar mark to the right of the range line.
Volume of Sales
Volume of sales is another important detail of the complete daily stock chart, and is
plotted by a vertical line somewhat similar to the price range from a fixed base line.
Take any horizontal, heavy line near the top or the bottom of the chart and let it rep-
resent zero, marking it on the vertical scale line at the left-hand margin, low enough
or high enough not to interfere, for the present, with the price picture.
If volume of sales is normally low for the stock let each heavy line above the zero
line represent 20,000 shares traded per day in that particular issue. If volume is nor-
mally heavy, or likely to become so, let each heavy line represent 100,000 shares of
volume. Plot the volume line by a vertical line, on the same vertical co-ordinate line
as the price range for the same day, extending the volume line upward from the zero
mark to the point on the volume scale representing the total volume of trading for
that day.
It is more satisfactory to try to keep the volume scale at the bottom of the chart.
This entails placing the price scale high enough so that the days of high volume will
not run up into the price range. If they threaten to do so, on abnormally heavy trad-
ing days, the chartist runs them up as high as practical and then simply breaks the
vertical line with small dots at its top, to show that the exact volume scale is being
temporarily disregarded, and then writes the actual volume of total sales above the
dotted line in small figures. This may conceivably become confusing if continued for
several days so only the figure for whole thousands of shares is written in, and noted
as small as possible.
Shifting the Volume Chart
If, however, the price range of the stock has declined for several months and has
dropped so low on the chart that it interferes with even only normal volume at the
bottom of the sheet, then the logical procedure is to take the liberty of lifting the
entire volume scale and moving it from the bottom of the chart to the top, so that it

now appears far above the price range instead of below it.
This, of course, breaks the continuity of the volume portion of the chart but it is a
liberty which the student may take when he is keeping his own charts, rather than
cutting off the sheet at the difficult point and starting a new one with the price scale
high enough not to conflict with the volume. It is a sort of emergency move for use
only in special periods of abnormal activity or rapid price movement.
In any case, such a move does not seriously impair the efficacy of the picture, since
it is an easy matter to compare the two portions of the volume chart, with the base
line at the bottom of the sheet for the first period of time covered, and the later por-
tion at the top of the sheet. When moving the volume chart to the upper portion of
the chart it is advisable, of course, still to place the zero, or base, line for volume low
enough so that it will not habitually tend to run off the top of the sheet.
The Time Scale
The scale at the bottom of the chart is the date scale and marks, for future reference,
the continuous passage of time over which the chart extends. It is a simple affair, for
each vertical line counts as one day of trading. In commencing the chart on a new
stock the first day of price range and volume is properly dated. The practical type of
chart paper will have its vertical lines so close together that it would be confusing to
try to enter the date of each successive day. The student may decide upon his own
system. He may enter the date only on Saturdays, or Mondays, or at any interval so
long as he maintains the regularity of that interval throughout the time duration of
the entire chart.
Holidays on the Time Scale
Many stock charts skip one day’s vertical line for holidays on the New York Stock
Exchange, or even for Sundays, but we do not approve of such practice. From a the-
oretical, as well as a practical standpoint, it seems highly logical to completely
ignore days on which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, no matter for what
reason, unless, of course, the closing should be extended over a long period of time,
as at the opening of the World War in 1914, or the bank holidays in March, 1933.
So long as there is no opportunity for free and open trading in any stock or in the
general market it appears illogical to leave a blank vertical line where the range and
volume record should naturally appear. If such blanks are left it tends to distort the
true pictorial record of trading which is the basis for chart reading and analysis of
technical action.
To make our meaning perfectly clear let us assume, that, for any reason whatever,
the New York Stock Exchange decided to suspend trading on Tuesday and Wednes-

day of a certain week. In such case, no empty spaces on the vertical lines would be
left on the chart. The range for Thursday would follow on the very next vertical line
after Monday.
Monday’s trading picture, in the normal sequence, always follows immediately
after Saturday’s, without any space left for the Sunday holiday. This theory is the
chief objection to yearly co-ordinate paper on which there is a line, dated, for each
day of the entire year. Of course, this objection applies to some extent also to special
stock chart papers which provide a time scale divided in sixths, but these sheets at
least omit Sundays.
On the other hand, however, it seems quite logical to leave vacant vertical lines on
days when the stock exchange is open as usual but when no transactions are
recorded in the individual stock being charted. This is an entirely different matter,
for in such a case there was ample opportunity to trade, and the fact that no trades
were made is an integral part of the trading history and should thus be included in
the chart picture.
In such cases we may adopt the simple expedient of leaving the vertical range line
blank but inserting a small x, or zero, slightly below the base line on the volume
scale to show that that day has been recorded but the volume of sales was zero.
Some chartists include a dotted vertical line on the price range scale in such a case,
showing the closing bid and asked price, but, in our opinion, this merely clouds the
chart picture and serves no very adequate purpose.
Charting Ex-Dividend and Other Information
There are a few other devices which are used to denote special change which seems
logically a part of the trading history of any stock. When an issue goes ex-dividend
it would be manifestly unfair and confusing not to note that fact. In such case a small
x is placed just above the high of the price range for the ex-dividend day. When a
stock goes ex-rights or ex-stock dividend a similar device (XR or XS) is used.
Helpful Notes on ‘‘Fundamentals’’ May Be Added
Many students find it helpful also to note in the margins of each chart certain sig-
nificant fundamental facts that relate to the particular stock charted. By including
up-to-date factual comment right on the face of each chart this data automatically
comes before the student daily and the need is obviated for reassembling this infor-
mation every time that technical implications become critical.
Probably the facts most frequently found useful when entered on chart margins
include comparative period earnings, dividend rate, dividend meeting date, capi-
talization, number of shares outstanding, funded debt, large bank or RFC loans,

dividend arrears, ratio of quick assets to liabilities, etc.
Anticipated levels of resistance to advance or decline (the subject of resistance lev-
els is taken up later on in the Course), once ascertained from a study of back history,
may be checked against the price scale, and your own symbols may be used to rep-
resent their varying degrees of importance. Also brief notes on news items of inter-
est may be added – but, of course, in such a manner as not to obscure the present or
future technical pattern.
Starting a New Sheet
When the chart reaches the end of one sheet of paper a new sheet is prepared with
the proper scale. It is important not to change the scale when starting a new sheet,
unless the old one has become utterly impractical, for changing the scale changes all
aspects of the picture and infinitely reduces the pictorial value of the new sheet in
relation to the old one.
Shifting the price scale up or down on the left-hand vertical margin, without
changing the scale itself, however, is not only allowable but advisable. For instance,
if the lowest horizontal line on the old sheet was a price of 40 and the price of the
charted stock has declined to 46 at the end of the first sheet then the price scale on
the next sheet should be lowered so that the lowest horizontal line would be perhaps
20 instead of 40. This automatically raises the position of the price range on the new
sheet and places it nearer the middle of the paper where it is not only more easily
read but is not so likely to drop off the sheet in charting of the subsequent move-
ment. And vice-versa in the case of a rapid upward movement which has brought
the price range too close to the top of the sheet.
In what the chart maker always hopes will be very rare cases the price range may
go up or down so rapidly that it runs off the current chart paper before it has con-
sumed the time capacity of the entire sheet. In such cases start a new sheet with the
price scale raised or lowered to bring the range again near the middle of the new
sheet. The old sheet may then be cut off on the last vertical range line so that it can
be moved over to join onto the next sheet of the chart whenever reference is desired
with the preceding movement.
In some cases you may discover that your stock moves off the sheet, either up or
down, too rapidly because you have made your price scale too large. When this
error becomes apparent there is nothing to do but start a new chart with a smaller
price scale; that is, allowing less vertical space to a full point of price change. More-
over, since it is difficult to compare two charts on which the price scale differs, you
will find it advisable as a rule to re-draw your first chart to the revised scale. This
should not happen very often, and you will soon learn to set your price scale to
accord with the normal price range or ‘‘swing’’ habits of any stock you start to chart.

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
All sheets of a chart series on the same stock should be carefully numbered at the
top of each sheet. The name of the stock, or its ticker symbol, may be placed in any
convenient available position, being careful, for later reference, that it appears on
each sheet of the series.
Chart work may be done with pen and ink, but we have found it easier, quicker
and fully as satisfactory to use pencil – preferably a No. 2 or medium soft lead to
give a fairly heavy black line. Trend lines, patterns, and other notes which are not an
integral portion of the chart itself, are subject to revision and should be easily
erasable in light pencil marks; for this we suggest a No. 3 pencil, sharply pointed.
Time Range Necessary
In order to be of practical service in studying formations and technical action a daily
stock chart must cover at least several weeks, and preferably several months. The
longer the period of time covered the more complete is the pictorial record and the
more satisfactory and valuable the chart in practical study and analysis.
Even though daily charts are necessary for gauging the very nearby minor trend,
from recent price action formations, we can construct charts covering practically any
period of time that we may choose, such as weekly, monthly or even yearly. Note the
daily, weekly and monthly charts of American Can that clarify this lesson (Figs. I.1,
I.2, I.3).
Although weekly charts require less frequent entry and provide a more compact
record they do not give as close a picture of immediate nearby movements as do
daily charts. The principle value of weekly charts lies in the student’s ability to more
readily judge the longer range trends and formations and assist greatly in deter-
mining the approximate limits of important trading areas where strong buying or
selling may be anticipated.
Monthly charts afford a condensed picture of the long Bull or Bear market swings,
of years’ duration, and show the important reversals of these same major trends.
These monthly charts, although by themselves of limited aid in short term trading,
do afford helpful long term perspective. Of all these types we believe the daily and
weekly charts to be the most profitable tools for technical students.
Thus far we have been speaking almost entirely of charts on individual issues but
we have previously seen that charts may be constructed on groups of issues as well
or even on the entire market – in fact on almost any conceivable object which is
traded in at changing prices in a free and open market.

STUDY I
to year, we find three well defined movements, all in progress at the same time.
These are the broad Major movements of bull and bear market proportions, the
Intermediate decline and rally movements that occur within the larger major
swings; and the Minor day to day, and occasionally week to week, fluctuations that
go to make up all Intermediate movements.
Major Movements
These are the long term continuous (bull or bear market) price trends that extend
over a period of years and which are the primary concern of long term investors for
income, having large capital resources and abounding patience. These trends
change their course most infrequently seeming to follow closely the cycles of busi-
ness. They are apparently more influenced by fundamental economic laws than by
those supply and demand factors with which we are most particularly concerned in
this study.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average chart (Frontispiece) clearly depicts 13 of these
Bull and Bear market swings from 1897 to date – six completed cycles and the start
of a seventh which, at the date of this writing, has not been completed. Note the
characteristic low volume periods from which bull markets habitually have their
origin – the ensuing ‘‘mark-up’’ and the warnings of extraordinarily heavy volume,
without proportionate price gains, that signal the final stages of these rises. See how
bear markets generally start down from bull market peaks with at first a sharp
increase of volume and price movement, and then are followed by declining activ-
ity until the pressure of offerings has run its course and the foundation is laid for a
new Bull movement.
Note the long base that preceded the tremendous bull market from 1924 to 1929,
the severity of the bear market that followed into 1932, and the latest bull swing
recovery from the latter lows to current date. How clearly this chart reveals the
absolute necessity of being on the ‘‘right’’ side of the market and the utter foolish-
ness of believing that ‘‘stocks can be put away and forgotten.”
Intermediate Movements
Within each major bull and bear market there are many lesser swings – ‘‘intermedi-
ate’’ speculative movements – that generally occur several times within the period
of a year. These afford excellent profit opportunities for the ‘‘technically’’ informed
trader – far greater in the aggregate than are possible for the long term investor hold-
ing commitments throughout Major movements.
Very much the same characteristics of price and volume action are found in Inter-
mediate movements as are noted in the larger Major swings of which these Inter-

mediate movements are but component parts. However, because of the more fre-
quent reversals and shorter duration and extent of Intermediate price movements,
one to profit repeatedly thereby must employ forecasting methods affording a far
finer degree of accuracy than when judging the long Major trend; and it is here that
thorough understanding and skillful application of the laws of technical analysis
pay largest returns.
Minor Movements
All of those component short term movements that go to make up each Intermedi-
ate swing are referred to as Minor trend or Immedi-
ate movements – be they a matter of weeks, days,
hours or minutes. However only the most nimble in This chart reveals the

tionate to the limited extent of these Minor move-
ment possibilities and do not warrant the wear and
tear on a layman’s nerves and the increased element of capital risk. Minor price
movements, nevertheless, do lend themselves to technical analysis and give,
thereby, early clue to the direction of price trend from areas of uncertainty, indicate
the start of new intermediate swings, and are most helpful guides to the timing of
one’s market operations.
Major Trends Shown on Monthly Charts
The three principal classifications of stock price movements, as described above,
may be seen as they occur in an individual stock on the monthly, weekly and daily
charts of American Can (Figs I.1, I.2, I.3). The monthly chart (Fig I.1) covers the
period from 1924 to mid-1937, and depicts a major upward or ‘‘bull’’ movement
from 1924 to late 1929, a major downward or ‘‘bear’’ movement from late 1929 to
mid-1932, and then another major ‘‘bull’’ movement from mid-1932 to late 1935. The
downward movement from late 1935 to mid-1937 may be regarded as a major
‘‘bear’’ movement, or as an abnormally extended Intermediate ‘‘correction’’ in the
Major ‘‘bull’’ market which started in 1932. Only the future can tell as this is written
which of these designations is correct in theory, since the first movement of prices in
a new major trend is often indistinguishable from an important Intermediate reverse
movement within the old major trend. However, from the point of view of the
practical trader the theoretical designation is not important; if he learns to

TECHNICAL APPROACH TO STOCK TRADING
recognize the Intermediate turning points, if he is able to buy when an Intermediate
upward movement starts and sell when it reverses into an Intermediate downward
movement, his profits will be safe regardless of the Major trend.
Intermediate Trends Shown by Weekly Chart
Figure I.2 shows the price range of American Can for each week from July, 1934
through June, 1937. Six Intermediate movements appear during this period – up
from June, 1934 to October, 1935; down to February, 1936; up to July, 1936; down to
August, 1936; up to November, 1936; and down to June, 1937. Each of these price
movements (with the possible exception of the limited upward move from August
to November, 1936) offered the informed trader a good ‘‘swing’’.
The forecasting of intermediate movements, such as those pictured on this weekly
chart of American Can, will be our principal study in this Course since they provide
us with the safest and most dependable profits. But, in order to forecast such moves,
it is necessary to follow and interpret the minor fluctuations of price as they swing
up and down within the path of the Intermediate trends; and for the study of these
Minor movements we must turn to the daily charts.
Importance of Minor Movement Study
Figure I.3 shows the daily price range (and volume) of American Can for the months
from April through September, 1936. Comparing
this with the weekly chart we see that it covers the
latter part of the intermediate upward movement Charts make it easier for
that started in February, all of the ‘‘correction’’ that us to analyze correctly
took place in August (an Intermediate movement in the technical position of
the direction opposite to the apparent Major trend is a stock.
frequently called a Corrective movement), and the
first part of the Intermediate up-trend that ran out in
November, 1936. Within this 6 months of daily price action we can find at least 20
minor movements, each running from a few days to a few weeks.
The minor movements, it will be seen, were mostly of too limited extent (in per-
centage price change) and ran their course too quickly to permit us to trade on them
with profit. They served, however, to build the foundations and patterns, or give the
signals, which made it possible to detect changes in the intermediate trend of ‘‘Can’’
stock.
The next six studies of this Course are devoted to the analysis and interpretation
of the minor movements which signal changes in the Intermediate and Major trends.
For the present all we need to fix in mind is the normal habit of stock prices to move

simultaneously in these three trends, and the fact that the minor movements are of
prime importance because changes which occur within them forecast the changes in
Intermediate trends on which it is profitable to trade.
Technical Analysis, is in fact, in a very broad sense, a study of the habitual price
movements and volume action of stocks, and the significance of any changes in
these habits, or departures from the current habit or trend. Such habits and such
changes from the accustomed action are most easily detected, studied and inter-
preted through the medium of charts. In fact, it would be extremely difficult to
understand and analyze them properly without recourse to a complete charted
record. That is the reason why this Course is based on the use of charts – not because
there is any magic in the charts themselves but because the charts make it easier for
us to analyze correctly the technical position of a stock and forecast its probable
future price trend.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
Summary of Chart Advantages
In our introductory lesson we observed some of the advantages of stock charts as set
apart from the tedious study of figures gleaned from newspapers, in reviewing the
trading history of any stock and approaching a study of its technical action. We
found that the stock chart not only saves time and offers complete memory but that,
through its easy coordination of the trading history, it makes the recorded picture so
simple as to permit of delving much deeper into the science of technical action.
And in reference to technical action we noted that it was composed of elements
beyond those of fundamental analysis but yet which have a decided bearing on any
full and complete study of forecasting future price movements, with special relation
to conditions arising primarily from market trading in itself.
When we become quite familiar with stock charts we shall find ourselves looking
for various pictures and patterns formed by our charts, but if we are to be complete
masters of our study and get the fullest benefits from our own analysis it is impor-
tant that we do not entirely lose sight of the fundamental basis for the formation of
those pictures and patterns.
That fundamental basis is in actual stock market trading, and actual stock market
trading is the result of individual actions by many thousands of people, based in
turn upon their own hopes, fears, anticipations, knowledge or lack of knowledge,
necessities and plans. It is the danger of losing sight of this human element in stock
charts that we must guard against, and since this human element is basic it may be
wise to fit it into the foundations of our study at the very outset.
Public vs. the Insiders
By and large, there are two classes of stock market traders who have the greatest
influence upon prices. They are the public and the insiders.1 Both are rather large
and general terms and neither is all-embracing but they should serve our purposes
of explanation.
The public portion of the trading element is made up of all those individuals
throughout the entire world who buy and sell stocks in the open market either for
investment or speculation, but in a rather casual, amateurish and comparatively
small way.
The inside portion of the trading element is made up of those individuals, groups
or associations who are professionals at the task, and who make the buying and sell-
ing of stocks for profit their important or only business.
1 Insider trading and stock manipulation today are much more difficult than the insider trading described
here and carried on in the years before the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

                     PAGE 54                      
==================================================

STUDY II
From such definitions it is not difficult to see why the insiders are generally more
successful in their market campaigns than are the public. They are in the minority
with respect to numbers but they are much better organized and equipped. Their
potential capital is probably a good deal smaller than the potential capital of the total
public trading element, yet their smaller capital is a hundred-fold more potent in its
purpose because it is professionally organized, is directed in specialized fields of
campaign and put to its greatest use by a compact, individual management with one
definite aim in view.
That one definite aim of the compact and powerful inside party is confined to rais-
ing or lowering the price of one specific issue, a group of issues or even the entire
market but, in the final analysis, it is directed fundamentally toward making a profit
for the inside party. This must be done in one of two ways. The insiders must buy
stocks from the public and sell them back to the public at higher prices, or they must
sell stocks to the public and buy them back at lower prices.
Why the Public Usually Loses
If the insiders are able to do this with fair regularity then it stands also fairly appar-
ent to reason that the opposite element in market trading, the public, is going to lose
the money that the insiders make through their profitable operations. In other
words, the public is the ‘‘goat’’. Many authorities and market writers will take
exception to such a bald and sweeping statement. They have done so in the past, but
the logic of our argument still holds.
It holds further when we consider that the inside element is in this business from
a professional angle. This is their livelihood, their income. They must make a com-
fortable margin of average profit or they would no longer stay in that business. The
unsuccessful insiders therefore drop out, but the successful ones remain to make up
the group which takes its major living by buying and selling stocks to the public for
a fairly consistent profit.
Though we are convinced that this is the theoretical case, still we would not have
the reader assume a fatalistic attitude toward such a situation. That is largely the
purpose of this group of studies. In the first place, the insider does not always make
a profit. He makes mistakes too, but they are in the minority.
In the second place, and conversely, the public does not always lose. In the third
place, the statement is a wide and general one that when the insider profits, the pub-
lic loses. In countless situations and campaigns both may profit.
And finally, our previous definition of the insider and the public is necessarily also
a general one. There is no clear-cut dividing line between the two groups. The man
who runs a grocery store in Keokuk might conceivably place himself in the theoret-
ical ranks of the inside element, by extraordinary ability, and reap handsome prof-

its, comparatively just as large as the real insider, even though he is not accepted,
strictly speaking, in the definition. He would be our idea of the model student who
thoroughly digests this and other studies on successful stock market trading and
who therefore, in greater measure than the rest of the public class, makes it his busi-
ness to profit from stock trading.
How to Become an Insider
We are fully conscious that representatives of both of these general trading classes
may read and profit from this course, but its effort is directed more toward aiding
the ambitious student in the public class to approach the ability, the technique and
the profits of the true insider.
There are two chief methods of accomplishing such a purpose. The first is to study
conditions and analyze them along the lines pursued by the insider, who must of
necessity be an expert at technical action. The sec-
ond is to discover what the insider is doing in the

are the result of
The first method is to analyze probable future

operations of the public trading element. The sec-
selling.
ond is to analyze the probable future operations of
the inside element. The technical market student is
therefore somewhat between these two classes and, it may be hoped, at an advan-
tage over both.
In many cases it is impossible to differentiate between the technical signals
accounted for by public operations or inside activity, but in such cases it is generally
also unnecessary. If our chart studies of technical action show us, for instance, that
much more powerful buying than selling is going on in a stock we need not worry,
for the immediate future, about whether the buying is coming from the public or
from the inside element. It would be more likely to justify our complete faith if it
came from the inside element but the important thing is that it is present and must
be considered the chief forecasting element in our analysis.
So public buying and selling has a most decided effect upon our technical picture,
but we must now also realize that the strongest and most important indications are
the result of organized buying or selling for a real campaign by the inside interest.
We must keep the activities, past, present and future, of both classes in mind, but we
shall find activities of the more professional element our most reliable and, fortu-
nately, our most frequent guide.

STUDY II
The Professional Group
The best known and most important element in the past in our group of professional
insiders is the ‘‘pool’’.2We shall not weary the reader with a detailed explanation of
what a pool is and how it operates; old style ‘‘pools’’ have presumably been out-
lawed by the SEC. The fact remains, however, that professional groups do still oper-
ate in the market and do create the same old technical situations. We may define a
professional group as an organization of the inside element banded together for a
campaign in any stock or group of stocks. That campaign consists in engineering
portions of a complete cycle which, in turn, consists of four parts – accumulation,
mark-up, distribution and mark-down.
A bull group accumulates, marks up and distributes. A bear group distributes,
marks down and accumulates. The former makes a profit by buying stocks from the
public, advancing their market price, and reselling them to the public. The latter
profits by selling stocks to the public, depressing the price and buying the same
stocks back again from the public.
The public, of course, is by no means always the same set of individuals but it is
the same general class of individuals. Furthermore, we must not be understood to
mean that a bull group is dishonest or unfair in advancing or depressing the price of
its favored issue. On the contrary, if the group has made its analysis correctly the
stock will move in the right direction largely of its own accord. Suffice it now to say
merely that the stock chart helps us to detect such professional operations and to
‘‘get aboard’’ on the right side of the market, through observation of recurring pat-
terns and their subsequent results.
Charts Detecting Professional Operations
The stock chart is constantly giving us a picture of all trading history. It is not always
an intelligible picture. In fact, the formations which are replete with forecasting sig-
nificance, develop rather infrequently; but they are highly important when they do
appear. They are important because the science of chart reading is devoted to study-
ing certain standard pictures which help us to forecast future price movement
through their successive appearance and the unanimity with which certain future
price movements follow such standard patterns.
After we have observed the usual habits of such successively appearing patterns
2 Today the activities of numerous groups of interested parties operating in various stocks along the lines
described in the text are no longer referred to as ‘‘Pools’’. These days ‘‘Sponsorship’’ describes wide-
spread operations on stock exchanges everywhere that are not all that far removed from connections with
the old pools. The old saying still holds that ‘‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’’.

or pictures we may come to give them technical names. We may find some pictures
which generally forecast a reversal of previous price movement and others which
mean merely a continuation of the previous movement. According to their relative
position with respect to the past movement we may say that they indicate accumu-
lation, distribution, mark-up or mark-down, and we
may thus act accordingly, to take advantage in our

interested in certain stocks who always use the same
campaign tactics. Other patterns can hardly be
explained at all, except by the use of some rather vague and involved theories. But
if we find such patterns valuable in forecasting the future price movement of a stock
we need not worry too much about what causes the patterns or their subsequent
habitual movement. It is enough, for our practical trading purposes, to recognize the
pattern and know its probable future significance.
Establishing the Patterns
The following lessons offer as complete a picture as possible of the more important
patterns, rules and practices, connected with this field.
The science of chart reading, however, is not as easy as the mere memorizing of
certain patterns and pictures and recalling what they generally forecast. Any gen-
eral stock chart is a combination of countless different patterns and its accurate
analysis depends upon constant study, long experience and knowledge of all the
fine points, both technical and fundamental, and, above all, the ability to weigh
opposing indications against each other, to appraise the entire picture in the light of
its most minute and composite details as well as in the recognition of any certain and
memorized formula.
Turns Are Most Important
The most important general element of analysis, it will easily be seen, is the judging
of important changes in trend, or turning points, in the price movement of a stock.
In detail, this will be the greatest part of our future study, but it is not too early to call
attention at this time to a few generalizations about the analysis of such reversals.
It is unusual for the price movement of any stock or the general market to remain
stationary for long intervals. Prices are usually going places and doing things. They
are either going down or up, and are in process of pursuing a trend – generally an

STUDY II
irregular trend, but a trend none the less. Once a major trend is established it must
be assumed, and quite logically, that such trend will continue until it is reversed.
That is a simple statement but it calls attention to the importance of gauging general
turning points in chart analysis. And we shall have more to say later concerning the
error of bucking such a major trend once it is established.
Suffice it now to say that trends are the important practical money-making aspect
of stock chart trading. They should be followed until a reversal is fairly defined.
That, of course, is the rub. Detecting reversal formations is not easy, for there are
many minor reversals which mislead the amateur and even the experienced student.
In the main, however, there are a few general observations which may assist. A
major trend seldom reverses itself suddenly or without warning. Once a trend is
established it takes considerable time and power to turn it. Signals of reversal are
generally given, therefore, for some time previous to the actual turn.
The most important signal is the beginning of minor reversals, the slowing up of
the previous movement, perhaps a gradual rounding off of that movement. After
the final extreme price of the previous trend has been established it must be tested
by subsequent movements. If such movements tend to depart in the opposite direc-
tion of the previous trend then the proof grows gradually clearer that a definite
reversal has taken place.
Importance of Volume
But the price range is not the only tool we have for judging such turns. There are, of
course, countless minor indications to the practiced student but the most easily
apparent, and valuable one, next to the course of actual price range, is the increase
in volume, or the activity of trading.
We shall have considerably more to say about volume throughout our entire
study, and especially in Study VIII, which is devoted to a detailed study of volume
action on reversals. A logical explanation of why volume of sales is important on
reversals, however, seems properly in order at the beginning of our studies.
Our charts and our study of technical action go back, as always, to their founda-
tions in actual open-market trading and the balance of buying and selling. We have
seen that when buying is stronger or heavier than selling the price tends to advance,
and vice versa. So while a stock is in a declining major trend the balance of supply
and demand is slightly on the supply, or selling, side. Until there is a change in the
technical situation this will continue to be the case.
Why Volume Increases on Reversals
But what is it logical to expect when our awaited change in the technical situation

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
does take place? Naturally, the change will be increased buying power. More and
better buying will be the most logical thing that will tend to reverse this technical
down trend. Gradually the buying will become more active and will slowly return
to a more equal balance with the selling. Finally, if the buying continues to improve,
it will exceed the selling and slowly move the balance of power from the selling to
the buying side and the major price trend is reversed.
But how can volume be affected by such a change? After all there must be a seller
for every buyer. This is quite true, but we must consider that there is a certain
amount of momentum to the major trend. Selling may conceivably ‘‘dry up’’ and
result in a change of the balance without increased volume. But generally, the sell-
ing has sufficient momentum to keep it in steady supply until our friends, the pub-
lic, begin to realize that the selling was unwise. They realize it long after the trend
has been reversed. We are attempting to realize it before the public does.
Volume Needed to Overcome Momentum
Granted then that in most cases the selling will continue in fairly stable volume
while the turn is being made, it is going to take a greater amount of buying to turn
the major trend than had been normal while the trend was downward. There are still
just as many shares sold as are bought but it takes more of both to stem and reverse
the momentum of the downward trend. Thus on major turns our index of sales vol-
ume will almost show an increase from the previous normal.
If the reader does not immediately visualize the logic of this tabloid explanation
he need not worry about the matter just now. This particular explanation for high
volume on reversals is not important from a practical standpoint, is admittedly far
from a complete explanation, and will be discussed more fully in our later studies.
In fact, if this were the sole explanation then we could not expect volume to
increase very greatly on reversals and the change might be so slight as to make our
consideration of the phenomenon unimportant. We have given this explanation first
because it seems the most basic and automatic one, but there are plenty of others,
perhaps more important and more easily understandable.
One of these additional causes for the common tendency for volume to increase is
simply because the previous move has begun to meet resistance. Insiders with large
blocks of stock to sell or buy must go slowly for fear of forcing prices down or up
too rapidly. But when they see the stock absorbing such selling or buying more eas-
ily, their first and natural tendency is to increase the speed of their operations, com-
pleting them sooner, raising volume of sales and leading to reversal, provided, as
assumed, that the new buying or selling power continues its own campaign.
Somewhat the same observations apply to professional operations or other artifi-
cial manipulation. The best way for an inside group to buy stock easily is to put it

STUDY II
down first, selling a lot of it, perhaps employing matched or wash sales (outlawed
under the SEC, but … ?) to raise volume and attract trading attention, and then sud-
denly to reverse into buying activity and buy up all the stock which its previous
campaign of discouragement has brought into the market. It is easy to see how such
artificial manipulation would raise volume of sales on the turn, or reversal.
In Study VIII we shall note a type of exception where high volume comes after the
turn instead of before it. This exception to the rule occurs most frequently when a
bear trend is reversed into a bull trend, but almost never on the reversal from a bull
to a bear market.
The One-Day Reversal
Our volume rule holds generally, however, and leads to what we shall name a one-
day reversal. It describes what many call a turnover day, a volume shake-out, or a
climax. If the market has been declining steadily on steady volume there may sud-
denly appear one day of exceptionally high volume, with price weakness in the
morning and strength in the afternoon, and with the close not far from the best price
and at the opposite end of the range line from the extreme low.
The logical assumption is that the one-day reversal was engineered for the pur-
pose of obtaining stock. They sell recklessly in the morning and catch many stop-
loss orders on the way down. Also the sharp decline and high volume of activity call
attention to the stock and many unwary traders sell it in anticipation of much lower
prices.
Just when this weakness and heavy selling is at its height, they reverse their tac-
tics and buy all the stock there is for sale. They find much more for sale on the way
up in the afternoon than on the way down in the morning for many watchers have
put their selling orders in just above the market, thinking the rally is only a short one.
The day ends with the price back up near the highest, ready to continue the move
upward tomorrow or within a few days, and the insiders have accumulated a nice
line of stock for their campaign. High volume is the natural accompaniment of such
a movement.
Examples of One-Day Reversal
The one-day reversal occurs at the top of a movement, indicating a change to a
downward trend, just as it does at the bottom, and with the same implications. In
either case it may be defined as a day of high volume with prices moving early in
the day in the same direction as the previous general trend and farther than previ-
ous levels, then turning back during the latter part of the day and closing at or near
the end of the day’s price range opposite its opening thrust.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
We can find several examples of the one-day reversal in the charts accompanying
this study. Note the following.
Fig II.2 – A one-day bottom reversal on May 14.
Fig II.3 – An excellent example of a one-day bottom reversal on February 5, and a
one-day top reversal on February 25 though less typical since the volume
did not run as high as on the preceding day.
Fig II.5 – A one-day bottom reversal on April 23.
It should be noted that the one-day reversal in itself is not a forecasting signal to be
given undue weight in practical trading. For one thing, not all one-day reversals
lead at once to rapid, worthwhile moves in the new trend; days and weeks may
elapse before the reverse move really gets under way.
However, as a phenomenon occurring frequently within other patterns or forma-
tions that are indicative of impending turns, it gives an important clue to probable
trends, and is most useful as a warning to watch closely the chart in which it may
have appeared to see what patterns may follow and to be ready for the move when
it comes.
Comparative Volume on ‘‘Tops’’ and ‘‘Bottoms’’
We have been discussing the general rule of high volume accompanying changes in
price trends, mentioning incidentally the one-day reversal as a phenomenon fre-
quently appearing at these times. It remains to be noted that volume is a relative
matter; i.e., when we speak of high volume we mean a volume of transactions
greater than has been prevailing for some time previously. It is particularly impor-
tant to bear this relativity in mind when comparing the volume which usually
accompanies and signals a ‘‘top’’ or change from an upward to a downward price
trend, with the volume accompanying a bottom. Each is normally characterized by
high volume; i.e., higher volume than has been prevailing, but the high volume at
tops is almost always much greater than the high volume at bottoms.
The prime cause for this difference between volume at tops and bottoms is
undoubtedly the fact that the public becomes interested and actively engaged to a
far greater extent in an upward or bull movement so that more pressure of volume
is required to overcome and reverse this optimistic public participation than is
required to stem the relatively uninteresting and inactive markets at the end of a
downward movement.
Price and Volume Must Be Considered Together
The point of our recent discussion is that both the price picture and the volume

picture are important in themselves but that for complete and efficient working
analysis of technical formations both price and volume must be considered in com-
bination.

tum. The reader will discover that high volume is

full well how often a stock or the general market
does quite the opposite of what the public expects
and should expect it to do. This is merely a point of insider psychology. The public
is generally wrong in its forecast because it would be difficult for anyone to make
money in the market if prices always did the obvious thing.
The insider is in business to make money, but he cannot make money by follow-
ing the crowd and doing the obvious thing. He makes money by dealing on the
opposite side from the public.
Volume Showing Insiders Crossing the Public
So it is not illogical to expect that technical action can be a great friend in detecting
when the insider is crossing the crowd and preparing to reverse the obvious move-
ment. In October of 1931, for instance, the general market turned from a major
decline into an intermediate recovery. At about that time Woolworth declared an
extra dividend and there was very bullish enthusiasm in the press and brokerage
gossip about the split-up of its British subsidiary.
There appeared no reason for any further bear market in a stock seemingly so well
placed as this one. The public bought avidly. It advanced from 45 to 55 in a few days.
But just about when the best news was coming out the stock began to hesitate. Vol-
ume of sales was terrific but the price barely advanced for several successive days.
The reader is right. It was inside distribution. The public was buying, but the stock
was not going up as fast as it should under such conditions. Why? Because the insid-
ers were selling tons of it. The stock barely got above 55 around the end of October
and before the close of the year it was back down to 35.
Another example of how high volume bears out a turn when prices cross public
psychology may be recalled when Lorillard suddenly resumed dividends around
the first of December, 1931. The stock rose only two points on the day of the
announcement and could get no further. The volume was tremendous, with nearly
40,000 shares traded in a single day, compared with a normal average of less than
10,000 shares a day. In the following week the stock not only lost those two points of

gain but was back down near its extreme low once more.
Again on about November 3rd, 1931, the general market was faced with a most
melancholy situation. RKO had just gone into receivership and was dragging Radio
down with it. Wabash had just gone into receivership and it looked as though a
number of the other weakened roads would go within the next couple days. In fact,
two or three names were mentioned about the street which were about to announce
default. The railroad wage controversy had just taken a disappointing turn. Every-
thing looked exceedingly bad for the stock market. Naturally, the public sold. What
happened?
The market dropped fairly swiftly in early trading but only went down about one
full point from the previous close on the accredited averages. From then on there
was a slow but steady recovery, and the market closed with a net gain of nearly three
points. Technically, it was a one-day reversal. Volume of sales was heavier than it
had been for many days but yet it was not terribly high. The important point for the
student was that the public must have sold heavily on the bearish news, and yet
prices went up. The only logical conclusion was that the insiders were buying heav-
ily in spite of the bad news. In just four days the market had touched a new high for
two months past and showed a further gain of over 12 full points on the major aver-
ages from the day when the powerful support and accumulation showed itself in
technical action.
Introductory Review
We have thus built, it may be hoped, some further foundation of introduction for our
study of stock charts and technical action. We have tried to show why technical
action is highly important and how the charts can help us in studying it. We have
noted in particular the value in detecting early signs of reversal in any major or long-
continued trend. We have seen that it is important to analyze the development of
such reversals in advance of public recognition. We have seen that such reversals
often result from operation of powerful inside factors and we have attempted to dis-
cover some logical explanations of why technical action often warns us that the mar-
ket is not going to do the obvious.
Finally, we have found that volume is quite as important as price movement in
making up our complete picture of the trading record, and we have noted that we
may find individual patterns and pictures which recur not infrequently and which
give us a reliable clue to probable future action from which we may reap practical
trading profit. We may now go on to a more detailed study of the most frequent and
dependable of such technical chart formations.

STUDY II
Major vs. Minor Reversals
In taking up a study of the more important chart patterns, or formations, it is logical
to begin with the pictures which generally indicate a reversal of the previous trend,
for we have already noted the rather apparent importance of such turning move-
ments. From a practical trading standpoint, they warn us to switch our short-term
speculative operations from the side of the previous main trend to the side of the
newly developed or reversed trend.
Reversals, of course, often occur when the long-term or major trend does not truly
reverse itself. This is somewhat of a technicality, however, since the intermediate
reversals may be quite worth playing. The longer the time taken for the chart to form
the picture of any formation the stronger is the forecasting significance of that pat-
tern and the longer will be the ensuing move. The length, size and strength of our
formation, then, gives a good idea of whether it is going to be a major reversal or a
minor one, and thus whether it is worth switching for.
Description of Head and Shoulders
Our first important formation which usually signals a reversal in trend is the Head
and Shoulders pattern. It consists roughly of a sharp point in the direction of the pre-
vious trend, followed a little later by another sharp thrust carrying prices beyond the
level of the first, and then another movement in the same direction as the two pre-
ceding ones, but going only about as far as the first movement noted, and therefore
not as far as the second.
The furthest turning point of this third sharp movement is the last objective of the
previous trend in the former direction, and is followed by gradual development of
the new trend in the opposite direction from the third small turn and in the direction
of the reversed, or new trend.
The formation is equally applicable in either direc-
tion, as is the case with most of our chart pictures. If

reversal and is termed the Head and Shoulders bot-
tom.
Its terminology is more easily traced by reference to the Head and Shoulders
top. The first extreme level of the three we have mentioned is called the left shoul-
der, the second, which goes a little higher, forms the head, and the third or last,

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
extreme level, equal in height with the left shoulder, is called the right shoulder and
completes the pattern, similar in anatomical formation to the figure of human head
and shoulders.
The Head and Shoulders bottom takes its name as the reverse of the Head and
Shoulders top, being the same picture merely turned upside down, though the pic-
torial relation to the human figure is that of a somewhat unusual posture. The Head
and Shoulders bottom picture is sometimes termed the pendant bottom, since it also
resembles somewhat the shape of a pendant and this terminology for the bottom
picture is a bit more logical for this particular reversal.
Chart Examples of the Head and Shoulders Top
If the mental picture of the Head and Shoulders formation is not yet quite clear to
the reader a few specific chart examples should make it so. A nearly perfect Head
and Shoulders pattern appears plain to see in the chart of Republic Steel at its bull
market peak in 1929 (Fig. II.1). Considering for the moment only the larger and more
conspicuous picture, the upthrust of prices to point B in the last week of August
formed the first or left shoulder of the pattern. The small recession from that point
to point C established the left side or base of the ‘‘neck’’. From here another strong
upward movement carried prices in the third week of September to F where a rever-
sal day occurred and the pattern of the price range culminated in a head. From this
point prices dropped off sharply to point I, locating the right neck line, then up to J
to make the right shoulder. At this point a reversal day again appears and prices
then drop off rapidly in the new downward trend – a major trend which continued
for about three years.
When we introduced this pattern we referred to it as ‘‘nearly perfect’’. In a perfect
Head and Shoulders formation the price levels attained by the right and left shoul-
ders, and the levels of the two sides of the neck should be approximately the same,
which is not the case here. Nevertheless Fig II.1 shows an excellent and a typical
Head and Shoulders. The size of the pattern, requiring two months for its comple-
tion and ranging through points in price, indicated a reversal in trend of major
importance.
Typical Volume in Head and Shoulders
The volume action during the formation of the Head and Shoulders in Republic
Steel was also typical. Note the high volume accompanying the formation of the left
shoulder, the somewhat higher volume at the head, but only slightly increased vol-
ume on the right shoulder. This is the typical volume picture to be looked for on the
Head and Shoulders formation, but it should be noted here that the relative volume

on the two shoulders and the head does not always follow this typical formula; vol-
ume on the right shoulder may, for example, be greater than on the left and, infre-
quently, greater than on the head. In general, however, increased volume
accompanies the formation of both shoulders and the head which, of course, is to be
expected from the operation of our general rule previously discussed of high vol-
ume on reversals.
We shall revert to the implication of the formation of the neck line at different lev-
els, and discuss other interesting points appearing in Fig. II.1 later on. Let us turn
first to another example of a Head and Shoulders top in which the pattern is not
quite so obvious to the beginner but in which shoulder and neck levels conform
more closely to the ideal picture.
‘‘Breaking the Neck’’
In the chart of Western Union for the first six months
of 1934 (Fig II.2), we have a left shoulder formed by

head, and the almost horizontal neck base area
BDFH – all conform with the ideal pattern, and
point to an eventual price drop of substantial proportions. In this chart the volume
that accompanied the formation of the left shoulder exceeded for one day the vol-
ume at the head, which is often the case; while the volume on the right shoulder
increased only slightly over the days preceding it.
We may proceed now to a consideration of the neck line which might be called the
vital point in the Head and Shoulders pattern. Note first that it is the retreat of prices
from the right shoulder at I to and below the line established by the base of the left
shoulder and the retreat from the head which completes the Head and Shoulders
picture. When the market reacted from point I on February 17 we might have been
justified in suspecting that a Head and Shoulders reversal was in process of form-
ing; in fact, a bold and well-financed trader might even have hazarded the selling of
Western Union stock at this stage; but, conceivably, the reaction from I might have
stopped at the 61 level and than turned up again. If that had happened we should
not have had a Head and Shoulders, and our too bold trader might have had to take
a small loss or, at least, wait for some time for his suspicions to be borne out and his
trade to show a profit.
Our important signal of a genuine Head and Shoulders reversal is, therefore, the
breaking of the neck line which in the case we are now studying took place on Feb-
ruary 23 when the market closed at 591/2, below the outer neck line B-H. Note here

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
the increase of volume, conspicuous when compared with the volume on the
days which preceded, which accompanied the breaking of the neck. This confirmed
the signal given by the closing of the day’s market below the neck line and is typi-
cal of the true Head and Shoulders formation, in which the neck line is nearly hori-
zontal.
Varying Width of Shoulders
Before proceeding to a more definite and practical conclusion of the point brought
up in the last paragraph, let us turn for the moment to some examples of the Head
and Shoulders pattern in which other variations occur – variations that we may
expect to appear quite frequently and must learn to recognize and interpret. In the
chart of US Industrial Alcohol for the first half of 1931 (Fig II.3), we have a right
shoulder (at F) which took considerably longer to form than did the left shoulder.
the rally from E to F gave us a neck line C-E which was broken on March 12 but the
volume of sales was very light, failing to confirm decisively the breaking of the trend
and indicating that buying power was not yet exhausted. The rally from G gave us
another neck line across C-G; this was broken with decisive volume on March 19,
and our reversal picture was complete.
In passing, note the fairly typical volume action in this chart, including the one-
day reversal on March 10.
Now turn to Fig. II.4, showing the action of Borden during the first six months of
1931. In this case we have the reverse of the picture presented in Fig II.3 in that the
left shoulder is heavier and took longer to form than the right shoulder. The neck
line B-D was decisively broken with volume on April 15.
Comparing these two charts, Industrial Alcohol and Borden, we may now
attempt to explain the reasons for the differing width of shoulders. Where the left
shoulder is wider, as in the case of the Borden pattern, large holders of the stock have
evidently been ready to take their profits in the neighborhood of 73–74 and distrib-
ution has been nearly completed while there was still considerable buying power.
Consequently, after the final thrust, the floating supply had fallen largely into the
weaker ‘‘public’’ hands; the subsequent rally to the right shoulder at E was very nar-
row and weak. In the case of Industrial Alcohol, strong holders were not yet ready
to distribute their stock when prices attained the peak of the left shoulder at B. The
public was still buying. At D distribution began in earnest and continued until the
strong buying interest in the stock was finally exhausted at H and prices dropped off
precipitately from then on.
This explanation is admittedly reduced to the simplest terms and does not take
into account any number of other factors which may have contributed to the rever-
sal in trend, but we must bear in mind that we need not, after all, concern ourselves

STUDY II
too much with the ‘‘whys’’. So long as the market runs true to form we need not care
why it does so.
The Time to Act
We may return now to the point brought up when we called attention to the break-
ing of the neck line on page 47. We have seen how the Head and Shoulders pattern
is completed when this vital line is broken, how the break away is typically con-
firmed by increased volume. Obviously, and without any further explanations being
required, the time to put in an order to sell the stock is as soon as the neck line is deci-
sively broken. Depending on the size of the pattern, its range and the length of time
it consumes in forming, the resulting movement in the reverse trend will be of
greater or less extent before an important recovery occurs. A clear Head and Shoul-
ders is followed normally by a worthwhile movement and offers the watchful stu-
dent an opportunity for considerable profit or, if he is already ‘‘long’’ of the stock, an
imperative signal to take his profits and stand aside.
In all of the examples we have shown, except Republic Steel (Fig II.1), and in the
great majority of clearly recognizable Head and Shoulders formations, the signal to
sell, evidenced by the breaking of the neck with increased volume, comes before the
downward movement has gathered momentum and allows ample time for prof-
itable action. Let us now study Fig II.1 more thoroughly.
Warning in Drooping Shoulder
In highly excited markets, with the public deeply involved, such as those that
occurred at the end of the bull movement in 1929, a new technical situation often
develops very rapidly and the reverse trend gets under way with startling speed.
A ‘‘drooping’’ neck line on a Head and Shoulders top is usually indicative of
rapidly developing technical weakness. Such a drooping line is, of course, produced
when prices drop down from the head to a lower level than the neck base previously
formed between the left shoulder and the head, exemplified in the action of Repub-
lic Steel (Fig II.1) when the bottom at I formed below the bottom at C. This is defi-
nitely a warning, and a warning which is not cancelled by a high right shoulder
following it. In the case of our Republic Steel chart, the fact that the rally from I to J
carried prices higher than the left shoulder at B, did not change the bearish implica-
tions of the picture. This rally might conceivably have carried even higher, higher
than the head at F, and still produced an important reversal pattern, as we shall see
later on in Study IV when we take up the Broadening Top formation.
On the other hand, the neck-base line remains the critical line in the pattern. Until

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
it is broken decisively the Head and Shoulders formation has not been completed
and a reversal signal has not been given. In the case of our Republic Steel example
the neck-base line (a line extended across C and I not shown in our illustration) was
not penetrated until Saturday, October 19, when the price dropped to 106 and closed
at 111.
Fortunately, there are often to be found in these fast developing Head and Shoul-
ders tops with drooping neck lines other critical lines and technical indicators which
give us a reliable reversal signal before the neck line is finally penetrated. It would
lead to confusion to enter here into a discussion of all the other formations and crit-
ical lines which may appear within a Head and Shoulders reversal: they will come
up in more logical sequence later on in our Course.
Patterns within Patterns
There is one minor pattern or formation in Fig. II.1, however, which is logically a part
of this Head and Shoulders study. So far we have considered only the large, conspic-
uous pattern which did not begin to suggest itself until the right neck base had been
formed at I, or possibly not until the reversal day at J. But closer inspection will dis-
cover that we had already formed a smaller and very bearish Head and Shoulders at
D, E, F, G, H. This pattern was not strong enough, perhaps, to have convinced us that
the long major uptrend had been broken; it might have forecast only a minor or inter-
mediate reaction; but it did sound a warning of technical weakness, putting us on the
alert for further developments. And it did, of course, honestly forecast an intermedi-
ate reaction for that is what we would term the movement from F to I.
At this point it may be well to refer to the other lines and notations drawn upon
the charts accompanying this lesson, which the student has doubtless noticed. These
have to do with other formations and significant price actions which will be taken
up later on in the Course, and referred back to in due time.
Action on Ascending Neck Lines
In stressing the point, exemplified by Fig II.1 that the Head and Shoulders Top with
a drooping or descending neckline shows weakness and forecasts rapid price action,
we do not want to convey the impression that the other type, where the neck base
forms on the right at a higher level than on the left, is not also bearish. All Head and
Shoulders Tops are bearish in their implications. The point to note about the ascend-
ing neck line, as illustrated in the chart of Borden, is that the ensuing downward
movement does not get under way so rapidly and that the profit possibilities are all
the greater because the ‘‘sell’’ signal comes in time to catch the full extent of the
decline. Head and Shoulders patterns with an ascending neck line present, as a rule,

STUDY II
the most distinct signals and, if prompt action is taken, the greatest potential profits.
An increase in volume on the breaking of the neck line is more to be depended
upon in the ascending neck line formations than in the case of the drooping necks.
With the latter types, the break may come on comparatively very little increase in
activity, and then the volume picks up rapidly as the movement gets under way. In
brief, the formation with the descending neck line is by far the more ‘‘tricky’’ and
demands greater agility on the part of the trader to make it pay maximum returns.
Advantages of Charting Several Stocks
Our discussion of drooping shoulders, and the greater agility they demand of a
trader, brings up one of the important advantages of keeping charts constantly on a
number of different stocks.
The Head and Shoulders formation is most frequently encountered in quickly rec-
ognizable form at the tops of major and strong intermediate upward movements.
That is why we find so many fine examples of this pattern at the 1929 tops and at the
tops which followed the big upward surge of stock prices in the first half of 1933.
But, as we all know, not all stocks make their tops at the same time; some ‘‘top out’’
weeks (in the case of intermediate moves) or months (in the case of major reversals)
before others reach their peaks. When the student sees that some of the issues he is
charting have made Head and Shoulders patterns (or other reversal patterns which
we shall take up later) he should begin to expect the same performance from others
which his charts may indicate are still in an upward trend.
Speaking very generally, Head and Shoulders Tops with the ascending type of
neck line are most apt to be found in stocks which are making their tops ahead of the
market as a whole and before general liquidation has begun. Stocks which top out
later, when the whole market has become weakened, are more apt to show descend-
ing neck lines and more precipitate declines.
Therefore, the student who charts a goodly number of stocks and sees that several
of them have reversed their trends, is forewarned of probable reversals in his other
charts and is ready to act quickly and decisively as these reversals develop.
Head and Shoulders Bottoms
Up to now we have been discussing the Head and Shoulders pattern primarily as a
top, forecasting a reversal from an upward to a downward price trend. But we men-
tioned the fact that the Head and Shoulders is equally valid as a reversal formation
at the bottom of a declining price trend, being sometimes called in this position a
pendant bottom.
Before proceeding to a closer examination of some typical Head and Shoulders

==================================================

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
Bottoms, we may make some general comparisons. In our preliminary study of the
significance of volumes at reversals in the market we mentioned the fact that activ-
ity in stocks as expressed in volume of sales is characteristically less after a period of
declining prices than after a bull movement. This is particularly notable at the end
of a major bear market – as in 1932–1933; the public generally has lost interest in
stocks and trading is largely in the hands of professionals and those who enter the
market through necessity. (Of course, the public, so-called, is never entirely out of
the market.) This general rule of lower volume at bottoms than at tops is reflected in
the typical Head and Shoulders Bottom picture. Since activity is at a lower ebb, the
patterns are apt to be somewhat smaller or take longer to form, and the higher vol-
ume which we have learned to expect at the culmination of the head and the shoul-
ders (as well as on the day when the neck line is broken) is apt to be less
conspicuous. Also, for the same reason of less activity, the upward move in the new
trend is frequently slower in getting under way. That means, in many cases, that
more demands will be made upon our patience when we act upon Head and Shoul-
ders bottom formation than is the case when we trade on a top.
In fact, by its very nature, being built up as it is by fairly wide fluctuations in the
price level, good Head and Shoulders patterns appear less frequently at bottoms
than at tops. Nevertheless, they do appear, and are just as important and reliable in
the one position as the other.
Examples of Head and Shoulders Bottom Reversals
Figure II.5, shows the action of Woolworth through the first six months of 1936.
Readers who have followed this stock will recall the long slow decline which pre-
ceded the period pictured in this chart as well as its subsequent fairly rapid rise to
63 by the middle of October. Note first the large pattern formed by the left shoulder
at A, the head at D, and the right shoulder at H – a nearly perfect formation and one
of such size and strength as to forecast a considerable move. The neck line B-G was
broken on June 9 with a sharp increase in volume. The volume on the two shoulders
and the head was not conspicuously greater than during the intervals between, but
this as we have already noted is quite apt to be the case on bottom reversals.
Note in this chart (Woolworth) also, that we had another Head and Shoulders for-
mation at C-D-F, smaller and less distinct but certainly valid. We were warranted in
buying the stock when the neck (dotted line through E) was broken on May 13. The
reaction, which came after the upward move to point G, might have tried our
patience; it is, however, quite often the case that a reaction brings prices back to the
level of the neck base before the true major movement gets under way. Conservative
traders would doubtless prefer to wait for the completion of the larger and more
positive formation before buying.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
Typical Variations in Head and Shoulders Bottoms
We have referred in our discussion of Head and Shoulders Top Reversals to the wide
variations in height and width of shoulders which are to be expected. These same
varieties occur in bottom reversals. Figure II.6, for example, shows Head and Shoul-
ders pattern with descending neck line, B-D, which reversed the downward trend in
Montgomery Ward in October 1933. Figure II.7 illustrates a pattern with a wide left
shoulder and narrow right shoulder which formed at the same time in the reversal
of Du Pont.
In the case of Montgomery Ward the neck line was broken at F on November 7
with a significant increase in volume. The movement of prices in the new up-trend
did not extend very far before meeting resistance and nearly two months of indeci-
sive price action ensued before the upward push got under way in earnest.
In the case of Du Pont, the narrower right shoulder was indicative of a more rapid
get-away. The neck line B-D was barely ‘‘dented’’ at F but, although the volume indi-
cations were encouraging, prices on this day (November 3) came back and closed
just within the pattern. The more decisive and final breakthrough came on Novem-
ber 7 with high volume, and prices closed the day more than a full point above the
vital line, indicating definitely that demand had finally overcome supply.
Flat Shoulders
In our first explanation of the Head and Shoulders formation we described the three
parts as being sharp movements in the direction of the preceding trend. This is the
clearest way of explaining the picture to the novice but it is not always accurate.
There are always three stages, as described, but very often they are not sharp thrusts
so much as they are merely flat or gently sloping levels beyond which the price
movement is unable to penetrate.
This is particularly true of the shoulders which may be either pointed, rounded,
flat or sloping. The point to note is simply that the stock is trying to continue its pre-
vious main movement but is restrained from doing so on successive occasions by the
development of technical power or pressure in the opposite direction, which we
shall later discuss as support and resistance.
The head itself may also be rather flat instead of sharp, but this is the exception
rather than the rule; the final thrust frequently takes the form of a one-day reversal
on high volume, as described earlier in the present study.
Several good examples of such sharp thrusts are to be found on the charts accom-
panying this study.

STUDY II
Tops Must Follow Advances
This is a point which will seem quite simple and apparent to the practiced chart stu-
dent but our experience with beginners leads us to stress it here. Many ‘‘freshmen’’3
are so eager when they discover a common chart picture that they neglect to analyze
it in its proper relations with the major movement.
Let it be remembered, therefore, that a top reversal formation can come only after
a previous rise, and a bottom reversal only after an appreciable decline. This applies,
of course, to all reversal formations as well as to the Head and Shoulders pattern.
Thus, an apparent Head and Shoulders pattern occurring in a period during
which prices for some time have had no definite up
or down trend but have been moving ‘‘sidewise’’,
Close inspection of any

trend; such patterns are not to be taken as indicating
a reversal in trend. In fact, they frequently develop
into continuation patterns, which we shall study and learn to recognize later, and
which forecast a resumption or continuation of the same trend.
Uncompleted Head and Shoulders Patterns
Another common freshman error is to ‘‘jump the gun’’ on what has the appearance
of becoming a Head and Shoulders pattern without waiting for a decisive penetra-
tion of the neck-base line. The temptation is admittedly great, especially when the
familiar formation shows signs of developing at a time when a reversal of trend
might reasonably be expected.
Figure II.8 shows a pattern which had every appearance of becoming a Head and
Shoulders bottom in May and early June, 1937. If you will cover that portion of the

STUDY II
a number of such formations which looked at the time as though they might become
Head and Shoulders reversals but which were never completed.
Wait for Clear Confirmation
The beginner in this interpretive science may find our frequent reverting to counsels
of caution somewhat disconcerting. It is admittedly trying to the inexperienced
trader to see where he may have lost a point or more of potential profit by waiting
and abiding by certain rules of conservatism. In actual practice, however, over the
long pull, the student will find that he sacrifices little or nothing in profits and fre-
quently saves himself from nerve-wracking if not actually dangerous false moves by
avoiding premature action. It is a matter of common knowledge in ‘‘the street’’ that
the trader who tries to buy at the very bottoms and sell for the last eighth of a point
at the tops loses more opportunities than his occasional lucky hits can ever recom-
pense.
In our study of the Head and Shoulders formation we have stressed the fact that
the pattern is not completed, and the forecast of a reversal of trend is not to be con-
sidered as established until the neck base line has been broken decisively. And we
have called attention to the fact that this decisive breaking is usually, though not
invariably, confirmed on our charts by an appreciable pick-up in volume. Caution
and experience have led to our recommendation of certain further rules to be fol-
lowed, by the beginner at least, in determining when to act upon the implications of
his charts. In general, it is wise to wait until prices have closed at least a full point
beyond the vital line in the case of a stock selling between, say, 50 and 100, that is
fairly stable in its market movements. In the case of a stock that is prone to violent
and erratic fluctuation this margin of safety may well be doubled. With lower priced
stocks of stable habits the margin may be reduced to half a point, and with stocks
selling over 100 it should be correspondingly increased.
This rule of caution is introduced at this point in our Course chiefly for the sake
of those bold and impatient students who may recognize their own proclivity to
rash action and the consequent need of arbitrary restraints.
Patterns in Weekly and Monthly Charts
Before closing our discussion of the common Head and Shoulders reversal, we may
find it interesting to examine its occurrence in long-term charts. Study Fig. II.9 which
shows Head and Shoulders formations which appeared in a weekly chart of Atchi-
son during 1934 and 1935, and a fine example which developed in the reversal of the
long-term down trend in 1932 on a monthly chart of Allied Chemical.
Aside from their purely academic interest to the technical student, their occur-

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
rence is useful to the long-term trader or investor as confirmation of the change in
the long cycle. Also, their appearance, and the accuracy of their forecast, in weekly
and monthly charts is additional evidence of their reliability. Moreover, they serve
occasionally to guard the practical trader from taking a relatively unprofitable posi-
tion in a stock against its major trend.
Finally, they may call to our attention a strong long-term movement in a certain
stock which we can then turn to account in our study of the daily chart. We shall be
encouraged to watch the daily chart for profitable buying or selling points, as the
case may be, in the direction of the major movement, and we shall not be so readily
discouraged by false moves against the trend our weekly chart has predicted.
Reliability of the Head and Shoulders
In completing our observation of the Head and Shoulders formation it may be
repeated that this pattern is not only the most frequent, popular and well-known of
the reversal formation series, but that it is deservedly so, because it is the most
important and the most reliable in actual practice. It is not infallible any more than
the other forms we shall discuss. They are all subject to exception to which we shall
refer later, but it still holds that disappointments in the Head and Shoulders forma-
tion are comparatively few.
The reader may test this, as well as other formations, constantly as he continues
his perusal of this Course, for the charts which will appear in later studies, while
they are inserted primarily for exemplification of other technical patterns, have also
been selected for their value as vehicles of review and many of them contain good
Head and Shoulders reversals.
Measuring Extent of Movement
We have stated early in this study the general proposition that the size and duration
of the formation may give us some idea of the extent of the movement to follow.
Such suggestions of measuring and timing formulae always fascinate the beginner
and frequently lead him into loss and confusion, or at best divert him from more reli-
able and profitable considerations.
It is only fair to state in the plainest terms before we proceed any farther in this
Course, that we have never found a reliable time factor or timing formula, and we
have examined and tested hundreds. That security prices move in cycles is undeni-
ably true, but a very brief study of the long-term chart (frontispiece) shows that the
cyclical periods vary in duration too widely to permit of any but the very broadest
generalizations with respect to time – certainly too widely to permit us to buy or sell

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS
with profit on such deductions. And this variance in time as between intermediate
rallies and reactions is even greater – and still more noticeable in the case of indi-
vidual stocks in which we have to do our trading. In brief, there are the best of rea-
sons for believing that a timing formula that can be converted to a profit in
intermediate or short-term trading, will never be discovered.
However, there are measuring inferences (in terms of prices) to be drawn from cer-
tain technical patterns. One such in connection with the Head and Shoulders forma-
tion we shall mention briefly here, with the promise that its possible uses will be
taken up later on in this Course, and with the urgent recommendation that the stu-
dent simply note it for the present, check it on his charts, but not attempt to make use
of it in actual trading until we have given it that later more detailed examination.
This measuring formula has to do with the probable level at which prices will
meet their first important resistance to further movement after breaking out of a
Head and Shoulders pattern. If we measure the vertical distance on the price scale
from the tip of the head to the neck base line, and then measure off this same dis-
tance vertically in the same direction from the point where the neck line is finally
broken, the point thus determined frequently falls on or very near the price level at
which the first important reaction or congestion occurs. This reaction or congestion
may be brief or long-continued before the newly established trend is resumed. There
are many exceptional cases and the measuring is, at best, only approximate.
The most important and reliable deduction to be made from the Head and Shoul-
ders formation is that our stock has reversed its trend and that the new trend will
continue at least long enough to permit worth-while profits to be taken.
Logic of Chart Patterns
It is only natural that technical students should ask for a logical explanation of why
certain definite chart formations forecast reversal of the previous movement, and
the Head and Shoulders pattern has been one of the favorite subjects for such ques-
tions.
We have previously noted that there are various such formations whose efficacy
in the matter of forecasting is well demonstrated, but for which the logical explana-
tions are rather indefinite and vague. We have always taken the attitude that it is
much more important to discover and establish the practical uses of such formations
than to explain why they act as they do, but, in most cases, a little thought will fur-
nish the clue to the underlying explanation of the individual phenomena.
Such explanations, almost without exception, take us back to our fundamental
basis of technical action – the human element of trading, the relative balance
between buying and selling, as well as, indirectly perhaps, to unprovable but prob-
able personally directed campaigns by insiders.

STUDY II
We have already noted that most reversals are accomplished gradually, by the
slow overcoming of excessive buying power by growing selling pressure, or the
slow overcoming of previously excessive selling pressure by the growth in strength
of buying.
Logic of Head and Shoulders Reversal
In the case of the Head and Shoulders formation the reversal is still slow and round-
ing but not quite so apparently thus as are other reversals where the turn is made in
a more regular fashion. This differentiation in the case of the Head and Shoulders
pattern is probably accounted for by the more rapid movement, the sharper swings,
of certain stocks at certain times, indicating that they are more definitely in the pop-
ular eye or, perhaps, that they are under the influence of professional manipulation.
The entire picture is composed simply of three particular points in the rapid
movement of an active stock where the momentum of the preceding trend is met
and stemmed by the rising tide of technical strength tending toward reversal of that
previous movement.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
The Gradual Reversal
In our first study of technical action and the shifting balance between buying and
selling power in the market, we noted that changes in technical condition do not
generally take place overnight but are usually spread out over a considerable period
of time. Gradually a previous major trend is reversed by the growing superiority of
buying over selling power, or vice versa, and we usually have plenty of time to
watch this turn in the balance of power on our charts.
In the immediately preceding study we also had occasion to note that our Head
and Shoulders formation, the first and most important of the reversal patterns, is
simply a specific and rather sharply integrated style of this gradual turning move-
ment which signifies a change in technical position and therefore in the main trend.
Our second type of reversal formation, the Common or Rounding Turn, is a much
more natural example of this change in the balance between buying and selling
power. In fact, it is the simplest and most easily understandable of all the many chart
formations which forecast probable reversal of the previous movement.
Definition of the Common Turn
The Common Turn is simply the gradual and fairly symmetrical change in direction
of the preceding major trend and is very directly the result of a gradual shift in the
balance of power between buying and selling. If, for example, the buying has been
stronger than the selling for some time past, we now know that the result will have
been a general upward trend in the price of our stock or stocks, as indicated by our
pictorial chart record of the trading history.
So long, therefore, as the buyers of the stock remain more anxious, more numer-
ous, more aggressive, more powerful, than the sellers, that preceding upward trend
will continue. Now, however, suppose that the selling grows a little stronger, while
the buying either weakens slightly or remains stationary at its previous strength.
This slight change in the technical balance will be indicated by a slowing up of the
previous advance.
As the selling increases in relative power it will finally become equal to the buy-
ing power and the result is a theoretically equal balance between the two, with the
result that the market level moves neither up nor down, but remains for a time quite
stationary.
Now assume that the new development continues and the selling grows still more
powerful with respect to the buying, until it is finally stronger. Now the balance is
moving the other way. There are now more sellers than buyers and the result will be
a gradual decline in the price of the market quotations for the stock. If this change in

==================================================

STUDY III
the balance of power is fairly steady and continues to its logical conclusion, we can
see, even without the aid of a chart, that our picture of the price movement for that
stock would be one of a long advancing trend slowly beginning to round off, hold-
ing in stationary suspense for a time, and then commencing a retreat, reversing the
previous upward movement into a new downward trend.
The technical chart picture thus resulting would be our Common Turn, or Round-
ing Top, the second of our reversal patterns. In truth, it is nothing more or less than
a chart picture of the gradual shifting of the balance of technical power from the buy-
ing to the selling side, or vice versa, to indicate a reversal of the technical position
and therefore a reversal of the preceding trend. The picture is also known as the
‘‘bowl’’ formation, since it resembles such a receptacle, the common up turn in nor-
mal position, the down turn in position of an inverted bowl.
Chart Example of the Rounding Top
The formation is such a simple one that it probably needs little further explanation
or example, but we may pause to glance at the Rounding Top, or common down
turn, shown in Fig III.1, the chart for United States Steel in March and April of 1930.
The general trend had been upward since the panic low of 150 in November, 1929.
Finally, came the last steep ascent from under 185 to above 195 at the close of March,
1930. Several one-day reversals on high volume, or turn-over days, may be noted in
the formation, but the pattern is a clear one showing the gradual accretion in
strength of selling over buying power, the final victory for selling and the resulting
reversal in the technical position of the stock and the major trend.
As usual, the picture here of the Common Turn is merely one of a rounding off of
the previous movement as the reversal develops into the new and opposite trend.
The similarity of the Rounding Turn to other reversal patterns, notably the Head and
Shoulders picture, is readily apparent. They are all pictures of this technical phe-
nomenon of a change in the balance between buying and selling power, only in the
Common Turn the change is more gradual, more steady, more symmetrical, than the
sharp moves and points of the Head and Shoulders pattern. Even in our accompa-
nying picture of the Rounding Top, in Steel, the reader may note the similarity to a
Head and Shoulders Top.
The dividing line between the two formations is sometimes difficult of detection
and it is often merely a matter of personal judgment
whether the chart reader will label such a formation

equally powerful and equally definite in their implications of a more or less perma-
nent reversal of the previous trend.
Just as this rounding top in Steel might easily have been a Head and Shoulders top
if the potential head and shoulders had been a little sharper and better defined
instead of blending symmetrically into the gradual turning picture, so we may
glance back at Fig II. 4, and notice how the formation in general might be construed
as somewhat of a Rounding Top, though its sharper points place it actually in a class
with the Head and Shoulders top.
We may find many additional examples throughout the charts in this Course of
the Rounding Top. The averages themselves present a very satisfactory one in April
of 1930 which ended the post-panic recovery and reversed the main trend of stock
prices back into the long bear market movement.
Chart Patterns in the Averages
In passing we may also note how and why the average, or index, charts often give
very good chart pictures. They are made up of many individual stocks so they give
us a composite picture of all the various patterns under way in the individual issues
which go to make up the average chart. When enough of these individual issues are
forming definite pictures, the composite picture in the averages is quite likely to pro-
duce a pattern of similar import, and when such a formation appears in the average
chart its power and importance are multiplied many times over for it shows an
unescapable unanimity of action.
For example, if many individual issues were to make strong Head and Shoulders
formations at exactly the same time, the average chart would, obviously, show a
similar Head and Shoulders. However, since the many different stocks do not, as a
rule, make their ‘‘peaks and valleys’’ on precisely the same days, the average chart
is apt to show a less specialized and distinct pattern. We should, for this reason,
expect the averages to show Common or Rounding Turns more often than do the
charts of individual issues at times of important reversals, and this is in fact the case.
We have just noted the Rounding Top in Steel during April of 1930. Now we find
that the averages themselves also presented the same picture at the same time. The
natural inference is that other representative stocks,
in addition to Steel, were forming their reversal pat-

formation’s appearance to the general averages
themselves. The technical top formation was therefore a very strong and important
one, befitting its subsequently revealed position as the formation which turned the

long and strong recovery following the 1929 panic back into the much longer bear
market which followed.
The Rounding Bottom
The Rounding Bottom or Common Upward Turn is, of course, the reverse of the
Common Down Turn, being simply the latter turned upside down, and with the
opposite implications, forecasting an advance instead of a decline. The Rounding
Bottom is the chart picture resulting from the gradual accretion of buying strength,
finally to overcome the preceding balance of selling pressure and lead to reversal of
the technical position from weak to strong, and reversal of the previous down trend
into one of advancing prices.
Rounding Bottoms are somewhat more common than Rounding Tops for reasons
which we shall discuss under the heading of volume but, before proceeding to that
point, we may first examine two charts which depict this formation in its simplest
and most typical aspect. Figure III.2 shows the rounding off and reversal of the long
bear market downtrend in Case in 1932. Prices had been declining for nearly three
years with alternating rallies and reactions in swings that tended to become nar-
rower and narrower until finally in May of 1932 the trend began to flatten out. On
June 10 there was a burst of buying, due perhaps to impatient inside accumulation,
which drove prices up 10 points in two days. Thereafter prices sagged back roughly
into line with the lifting trend already noticeable at the bottom, and then worked up
with volume increasing rapidly as the curve accelerated.
Figure III.3 shows a Rounding Bottom which reversed an intermediate reaction in
Goodrich, turning it into a new upward movement from 7 in October, 1935 to 21 in
February, 1936. In this chart, as in Case, we see a brief spurt of activity at the bottom
which broke the regular curve for a few days but did not appreciably distort or con-
fuse the typical ‘‘bowl’’ picture and again, as in the preceding chart, we note volume
picking up rapidly as the upturn developed.
(Formation A-B-C appearing on Goodrich chart will be discussed in Study VI.)
Volume on Rounding Turns
We mentioned above that Common Rounding Turns occur more frequently at bot-
toms than at tops. This naturally follows our experience with volume which we have
noted is apt to be high at the culmination of bull movements and to dwindle away
in long declines. The Common or Rounding Turn in its simple form is a picture of a
very gradual and regular change in technical balance. This gradual and regular
change, obviously, would be thrown into irregularities by any sudden, sharp

increases in activity. This is the reason why simple Rounding Turns are found less
often at the active peaks, than at the dull bottoms.
Volume Increase on Common Turns
If the student will refer again to the charts of Rounding Turns we have been dis-
cussing, he will note that, in every case, volume picks up rapidly as the curve swings
past ‘‘dead center’’ and around into the new trend.
This noticeable increase in activity is an almost

formation that gives us our signal to buy or sell, as
the case may be.
The student of this course will find that many of the charts of other reversal for-
mations to follow, as well as several of the Head and Shoulders patterns in the pre-
ceding study, partake somewhat of the nature of Common Turns. This is particularly
true of the Head and Shoulders formations in which the reversal is accomplished
without wide fluctuations or sharp thrusts. Refer, for example, to the chart of Bor-
den, Fig. II. 4. In any case, whenever either construction is possible, it will be found,
as usual, that both constructions lead to the same conclusion or forecast.
So simple is the Rounding, or Common, Turn formation that we need spend no
further time in its study. It is probably the most logical and most easily compre-
hended formation in chart reversals. It is fallible just as are all chart formations, but
it is sufficiently definite in its forecasting implications to give it a high place in our
technical studies.
The Triangle or Coil
The third of our most important reversal formations is generally known as the Tri-
angle, or Coil, because of its similarity in appearance to those descriptive appela-
tions. We prefer and shall use the term triangle, because it seems to us to be more
descriptive of the pictorial pattern and because it makes easier the description and
classification of its varieties, but various authorities use the term ‘‘coil’’ because it
gives the suggestion of a spring being wound up tighter, as the formation comes to
its apex, until it is finally released and breaks out of the receding formation with a
pent-up, or wound-up, force.
As usual, the picture of the Triangle is formed by the action of the price range on
our chart. In its basic form which we will take up first, it has the appearance of an
equilateral triangle lying on its right side, with its base a perpendicular line at the
left side of the formation, and its median line a horizontal one extending to the right.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
Its apex is also formed to the right, therefore, and the entire triangle points in that
direction, to the future chart formation instead of the past. We shall refer to this basic
form hereafter as the Symmetrical Triangle.
Thus the basic formation is the result first of comparatively wide swings of the
price range on the chart, with a subsequent gradual and symmetrical narrowing
down of such swings to bring the price range into smaller and smaller proportions
until the apex is reached at a point where the daily ranges for the stock are abnor-
mally small and the volume, therefore, naturally also at a low ebb, as interest and
trading in the stock diminish.
Actually, of course, this basic pattern is never perfect and is commonly broken up
by irregularities. Much latitude, must, therefore, be taken in the interpretation of the
triangular pattern but the general picture is one of the most common and important
of chart patterns.
Triangle Unreliable as a Reversal
Since we are studying, in this section, cardinal reversal formations, this current
study will be confined to a consideration of the Triangle as a form of reversal, but it
is only fair, and, indeed, quite important, that we realize immediately that the Tri-
angle is by no means always indicative of a reversal in technical position. In fact, the
Triangle appears more often as an intermediate or continuation formation than a
reversal formation, and we shall study it again under the former connotation in
Study VI.
For the time being, it is sufficient if we realize that the Triangle can be either a con-
tinuation or a reversal pattern. That is the chief reason why it is not so important a
reversal formation as is the Head and Shoulders picture. We rank it second in impor-
tance to that formation because the Head and Shoulders pattern is practically
always indicative of reversal while the Triangle, though found more often, must be
content with second place because it is not as definite or as reliable in its implica-
tions.
This disadvantage of the Triangle as an example of the reversal type of formation
is a practical one because there is no sure way of telling during its formation whether
a Triangle will be intermediate or a reversal. Of course, the chart student must
always watch carefully the direction and character of the subsequent movement,
after the completion of any formation, to be certain that he has made a correct analy-
sis and that the pattern noted is a genuine one but, in the case of other chart pictures,
he is almost always able to form a definite advance opinion of what the next move
shouldbe from the character and style of the pattern itself, before it reaches comple-
tion.
In the case of the Triangle, we know of no certain rule whereby the student may

==================================================

STUDY III
satisfy himself that the triangular formation is going to be intermediate or a reversal
until the subsequent movement has broken away from the apex of the Triangle.
Compared with our other reverse formations, therefore, the Triangle does not give
as early a forecast suggestion.
The Break-away Move
From our description of the Triangle itself, it stands to reason, that, as the price range
and activity gradually narrow down to form the point or apex, a critical period
approaches when the abnormally small range must give way to a wider and more
definite movement.
The beginning of this subsequent movement, following the apex of the triangle, is
called the break-away, and it generally indicates the direction of the large, profitable
price movement to follow the formation. In some cases, the apex will be followed by
what is known as a false move, in a short and temporary shift of the price in the
opposite direction from the later and true major movement. Such false moves will
be discussed at greater length in Study IX. They are comparatively infrequent, but
when they do occur they interpose still another disadvantage in the triangle forma-
tion.
We would not give the reader the impression that we scorn or distrust the Trian-
gle. On the contrary, we consider it a very important and very useful chart forma-
tion. We are merely trying to give a clear and complete view of the drawbacks of this
pattern, particularly as an indication of reversal, which are somewhat greater than
in other technical pictures.
Denotes Continuation More Often than Reversal
It is only fair to state again that, while the Triangle is both common and important
as a form of reversal, still it is more common and more important as a continuation
formation. In other words, other things being equal,
the Triangle denotes continuation of the previous

from the pattern itself, whether it is going to turn
out to be a continuation or a reversal. This statement
is qualified by the paragraph above, for it follows naturally that it should generally
be assumed a Triangle in process of formation is going to be a continuation, or inter-
mediate formation, until the contrary is proved to be the case.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
Aids to Advance Judgment
Another helpful consideration is the pattern of the whole movement preceding the
beginning of the Triangle’s formation. If the preceding move has been long and
begins to show other signs of possible exhaustion, then the chances are more favor-
able that the Triangle will signal a reversal. If the previous major trend has been a
short one, however, and other indications suggest continuation of the trend then the
chances are naturally better that it will really turn out to be such a continuation,
rather than the rarer form of reversal.
Analysis of other and more fundamental factors is also frequently important, and
helpful, in connection with the chart analysis of the Symmetrical Triangle. Here the
technical picture by itself fails to give the usual definite forecasting signals; the Sym-
metrical Triangle simply emphasizes the indication that somewhere near the apex it
is forming there is going to be a very wide, rapid and worthwhile movement in the
price of this particular stock. Which way? We are obliged to look elsewhere or await
the break-out to answer this question.
We have pointed out one possible guide but, in the main, the most helpful indica-
tions in such a case are generally those dealing with fundamentals, or at least with
aspects not immediately present in the technical formation itself. How are earnings?
What are the future prospects? What surprise news is possible on this stock? What
is the future for general business? Is the technical position of other stocks, and of the
general market itself, strong or weak? Such pertinent questions, while not all fun-
damental by any means, often give the correct answer to our technical problem as to
whether a Symmetrical Triangle in process of formation is going to turn out to be a
real reversal of technical trend, or merely a continuation formation (a temporary halt
or congestion leading to a strong resumption of the previous trend).
Examples of Triangular Reversal
We have felt it necessary first to bring out the drawbacks in this introduction to the
Triangle formation, but we may now take up our more immediate interest, the study
of the Triangle, not in general, but as a clear-cut reversal of the previous major move-
ment.
When a Triangle reverses the movement from up to down it is called, quite logi-
cally, a Triangular Top; when it reverses the previous trend from down to up then it
is called a Triangular Bottom.
Figure III.4 shows a good example of the Symmetrical Triangle as a reversal,
occurring in Auburn at the ‘‘April Tops’’ of 1936. The student will have no difficulty
in seeing the triangular picture suggested by this chart even without the aid of the

STUDY III
boundary lines that have been drawn on it from points A and B respectively to the
apex at C. Point A is at the peak of the intermediate bull movement which took
Auburn to 541/4on March 5; point B is the bottom of the minor reaction which pre-
ceded this final upthrust of prices. Up to these points the Auburn chart had shown
for some time previous a picture of constantly higher tops and higher bottoms on
each minor swing of the price range. Now, however, although the bottoms continue
to hold within a slightly upward trend, the minor rallies become progressively
weaker, with the result that the price range narrows appreciably, converging into the
apex at C. During this same period of narrowing price range, note that the volume
of transactions tends to ‘‘dry up’’ each week’s volume appreciably less as the apex
of our price formation is approached.
But, as we have remarked in our general introduction to the Triangle pattern, we
had no way of knowing from this chart alone in which direction prices would even-
tually break out. If we were following a number of charts, however, we should have
seen that many of them were developing at this same time formations indicative of
reversal, so we should have had reason to be slightly suspicious of our Auburn Tri-
angle.
Break-out Confirmed by Volume
Our suspicions were at least partly confirmed on April 11 when prices broke
through our boundary line on the down side and the volume (making allowance for
the fact that this was a Saturday with only two hours of trading1) showed a definite
increase. The market closed, however, with the last transaction of the day practically
back to our pattern – certainly not a decisive break-away, and possibly, so far as we
could tell then, only a false move (which we shall discuss later). But Monday told
the story. The volume exceeded any day for two weeks back and prices broke away
definitely, closing over 3 points below our pattern. Time to sell Auburn!
We have stressed the volume action in our study of Fig. III.4 because it is typical
of the Triangle formation, whether reversal or continuation. The shrinkage of vol-
ume as the pattern works towards its apex is always quite apparent though not nec-
essarily at a regular rate from day to day. Distinctly higher volume when prices
break out of the pattern is always to be expected, and any slight break on dull vol-
ume may well be regarded with suspicion. The genuine break-out, into the new
trend (or rapid resumption of the old trend), is almost invariably confirmed
promptly by noticeably greater volume. The student will note that the rule of vol-
ume on the definite break out of formation is the same in the case of the Triangle as
in the other patterns previously studied, and it may be further noted here that this

general rule – that volume picks up noticeably with the break of prices into a new
trend or out of a congestion – holds with practically every important technical pat-
tern.
Apex Not Always Reached
One more point may well be discussed before we drop our study of Fig. III.4 lest it
cause confusion in the student’s mental picture of the Triangle.
It is not necessary that prices shrink into the
absolute apex of the pattern before they break-out
into the new movement. As a matter of fact, they Volume picks up

range is converging and a triangular pattern form-
ing, we must draw our boundary lines, tentatively
at least, and be on the watch for their being broken with an accompanying volume
signal. In very active stocks, leaders with a large floating supply and a big public fol-
lowing, the break may be expected to come well ahead of the apex. In relatively inac-
tive stocks, on the other hand – those which normally attract public attention only
in periods of rapid mark-up or mark-down – volume and price range may dwindle
almost to nothing, right into our theoretical apex, before breaking out.
Break-out may Come Quickly
No special significance attaches to either an early or late break out of a Symmetrical
Triangle Reversal, the forecast in either case being the same. However, the Triangle
in which the price range converges far into the apex does call for a more critical
examination of any out-of-bounds movement that may appear. The price range in
the apex becomes so small that a very slight change in price, effected perhaps by just
a few transactions, may pierce our theoretical boundary lines and yet not constitute
a genuine break-out signal. The longer and narrower the formation, the greater the
necessity for awaiting a decisive break-out, closing well out of the pattern and con-
firmed by a good increase in volume, before placing a ‘‘buy’’ or ‘‘sell’’ order in the
stock.

had made a very impressive intermediate rally and then turned again into the long
bear trend. The top of this movement formed a pattern which illustrates very well
the point we made on page 70 when we stated how certain formations may be clas-
sified in more than one way but will, nevertheless, indicate the same forecast.
The top formation on this chart may be construed, for example, as either a Sym-
metrical Triangle or a Head and Shoulders Top. Some chart students will see the for-
mation developing as a Head and Shoulders (with Head at D and Shoulders at A
and E) while others will see more readily the triangular suggestion of the price trend
converging within the lines A-C and B-C. Either construction is perfectly valid and,
as noted above, both have the same significance. It happens in this case that the
boundary line B-C of the Triangle is also the neck-base line of the Head and Shoul-
ders pattern. This line was broken with high volume on August 8.
Strict Construction of Boundary Lines
In drawing the boundary lines for the Triangle A-B-C we have disregarded the one-
day peak at D, a latitude which, we have noted on page 75 it is sometimes necessary
to take in construing the triangular formations. A very strict technician might object
to this as a violation of one of the rules of this science which states that pattern lines
should always be projected across the outer limits and never through any portion of
the price range. And, generally speaking, we agree and would caution the student
against taking such liberties with his chart until he has had considerable experience.
In this case, the triangular pattern is quite evident to the eye and the line A-E-C does
bound the outer limits of the important congestion.
Early Break-out Reliable
This Houston chart illustrates also a typical break-out early in the development of
the Triangle, less than half way, in fact, from the start of the pattern to the theoreti-
cal apex at C. Such early break-outs, as we have noted above, are almost invariably
genuine and call for prompt trading action – in this case, selling.
A sale of Houston shares following this break-out signal would, presumably, have
been executed at a price around 75, and then we should have had a period during
which our forecast apparently refused to come true. But note that prices in the ensu-
ing rally did not go above the level of break-out, and that the downward implication
of our reversal formation was eventually borne out, bringing a very substantial
profit to the technical trader with the courage of his convictions. This rally failing to
return to the level of the break-out, or to the neck-base line of the Head and Shoul-
ders pattern, is a frequent occurrence which will be taken up later on in this course
in the study of resistances and the placing of stop-loss orders.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
Still another feature of our Houston chart is the large Triangle A-G-F. Strictly
speaking, this partakes more of the nature of a Right-Angle Triangle than a Sym-
metrical Triangle. We will take up the significance of the Right-Angle Triangles fur-
ther on in this study. In the meantime, it will suffice to state that this larger pattern
gave an even stronger forecast of an approaching decline of major proportions. The
break-out accompanied by high volume on September 22 is decisive and typical.
Triangles on Weekly and Monthly Charts
Figure III.6 shows Triangle Reversal formations we may expect to find in long-range
charts – one in a weekly chart of Standard Oil of New Jersey and the other in a
monthly chart of Public Service of New Jersey. These have the same uses for the stu-
dent as have the long range Head and Shoulders which were illustrated and dis-
cussed in Study II, and it is suggested that the reader turn back at this point to page
ref. and review our explanation of their practical value.
Triangular Bottom Reversals
We can dismiss with a brief reference to two typical examples, the subject of Sym-
metrical Triangle Bottom Reversals, which signal the turn from a downward to an
upward price trend.
Figure III.7 shows a Symmetrical Triangle Bottom Reversal in Auburn in the Fall
of 1933. Prices penetrated the boundary line on the up-side – but not decisively – on
November 3. On the following day which was Saturday, if we double the volume
shown on the chart in order to bring it into fair comparison with the full trading days
preceding it, we have our break-out confirmed and the reversal of trend established.
Figure III.8 pictures a Symmetrical Triangle which formed in the upward turning
of Johns Manville in March, 1935. In this chart it is important to note the movement
of prices on April 3, falling below the lower boundary of our pattern but returning
and closing the day within it. Refer back at this point to our discussion on page 79
of the likelihood of false moves in Triangles that work well out into the apex before
breaking out. The volume of transactions on April 3 was insignificant which, in
addition to the fact that the closing price for the day fell inside the pattern, would
have prevented us from making an incorrect interpretation and from taking any pre-
mature action. On April 5 there was a similar price movement, again closing practi-
cally within the pattern, but note this time the increase in volume – an important
clue to the probable significance of our Triangle. The volume action on the several
days following confirmed the forecast of a reversal.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
Relation of Price Move to Pattern Size
We have mentioned previously, in our study of the Head and Shoulders formation,
the general principle that the greater the price range and the greater the time dura-
tion required in the formation of any technical chart picture, the greater is that pic-
ture’s importance, and the greater the subsequent move which the formation
forecasts. This general principle applies as well to the Symmetrical Triangle Rever-
sal, but we must again stress the point that the rule is to be construed only in the
most general way and is subject to many exceptions. We do occasionally have very
long and continuous movements developing out of surprisingly small Triangles
and, vice-versa, large Triangles do infrequently lead to disappointingly short moves.
The rule, nevertheless, is a useful one to have in mind and our word of caution is
introduced chiefly to remind the student that the technical picture may change at
any moment and that he cannot put away his chart and forget it after taking a posi-
tion in a stock.
The student will find it interesting at this point to review the charts we have
shown so far in this study and compare them as to size of pattern and ensuing price
movement.
Wave Movement Following Apex
Before leaving the Symmetrical Triangle as a reversal, it is not out of order to men-
tion in passing a rather unusual type of action that
follows in rare instances the completion of the Tri-
angle’s apex. We have seen that at that point, or The greater the price
more often before it is reached, the movement usu- range and time duration
ally takes the form of a break-away, with a fast and the greater is that

lowing. In exceptional cases, especially when the
Triangle is somewhat irregular and dogeared, and
also when the general market is inactive or indecisive, a Symmetrical Triangle will
develop a good and true apex, but there will be no break-away or sharp following
movement. Instead, the stock remains comparatively inactive and lethargic, and the
price range widens out only moderately from the apex.
In such cases it is generally found that this indecisive wavering will not only con-
tinue for a week or more but that the price range will vibrate around the level of the
preceding apex. In other words, the triangle has been left behind and the stock will
fluctuate in a wider range than at the apex, but it will not go very far in either direc-
tion. It will show a gentle decline for perhaps three or four days to perhaps three or

STUDY III
four points below the previous apex level. Then it will lackadaisically reverse itself
and swing up for three or four days to a range perhaps three or four points above
the preceding apex level. There may be four or five of these quiet and disinterested
reversals before the stock finally comes to life and decides to go somewhere in par-
ticular: and even then the next major move is seldom a sharp or rapid one, and often
requires another small technical formation preceding such a major move, even to
stretching out the previous Triangle formation still further and coming to another
gradual apex.
This rare ‘‘wave motion’’ is the alternate subsequence to the apex of a fairly long
Triangle and the exception to that Triangle’s normal forecast of a fast and powerful
break-away movement. When observed in time it offers an opportunity for short-
swing operations, buying a few points below the previous apex level and switching
for renewed decline a few points above that level. Such trading switches amount
almost to scalping2however, and, while they may well prove quite profitable they
still carry dangers, should always be protected with stop-loss orders, and are not
recommended for the average chart trader.
Right-angle Triangles
Thus far in our study of triangular reversals we have considered only the Symmet-
rical Triangle, which has a more or less indefinite vertical line for its base and two
equal legs that come to a symmetrical apex. The Symmetrical Triangle is more com-
mon but not so easily analyzed as are the various types of Right-angle Triangle. The
Right-angle Triangle is similarly formed by a converging of the price range, and its
base line is the same, a more or less imaginary vertical line on the left of the pattern.
The difference lies in that instead of having symmetrical legs projected at approxi-
mately equal angles from the base, the Right-angle Triangle has one leg extended
horizontally, forming a right angle with the base, while the other leg completes the
enclosed triangle as the hypotenuse. The form of Right-angle Triangle, with its
hypotenuse slanting down from the beginning of the pattern to its conclusion, is
called a Descending Triangle, and almost invariably forecasts a downward move-
ment to come. The Right-angle Triangle with its hypotenuse slanting upwards is
called an Ascending Triangle, and it almost invariably forecasts a subsequent
advance.
More Reliable as Forecasters
The Right-angle Triangles are, therefore, much more valuable for the purposes of
2 The term ‘‘scalping’’ refers to the measured taking of tiny profits on trades, regardless of whether the
trade or trades go higher or lower after the scalper pockets his acceptable small profit.

practical forecasting than the Symmetrical Triangles. We have seen that the Sym-
metrical Triangle offers the decided drawback of not forecasting, in itself, the direc-
tion of the subsequent movement. The Right-angle Triangle does make such a
forecast, according to the direction of the hypotenuse. If the hypotenuse as it takes
form on our charts points downward the forecast is down, and vice-versa.
As in the case of the Symmetrical Triangle, the Right-angle Triangles appear more
often as intermediate formations, signifying continuation of the previous move-
ment, with the hypotenuse inclined in that previous direction of trend. By no means
infrequently, however, the Right-angle Triangle is found with the hypotenuse
inclined in the opposite direction from the preceding movement and, in such cases,
the formation falls into our current study of reversals, which change the preceding
trend to a new and opposite direction. It will easily be seen then that only the
Descending Triangle can be expected to form a topreversalformation, and that only
the Ascending Triangle can be expected to form a bottom reversal formation.
The Descending Triangle as a Reversal
The strongest reversal patterns, as we have previously noted, are formed at the tops
of major or important intermediate rises or, to put it another way, at the beginning
of major or important intermediate downward price movements. This is especially
true of the Head and Shoulders formation, taken up in Study II, which seldom
appears in useful form at the reversal of minor trends. The Right-angle Triangles of
the descending type also appear at their best on the tops of important moves, but
they are formed with fair frequency, as well, in the top reversals of less extensive ral-
lies, and are very useful to the technical student in forecasting such reversals.
An excellent example of a large Descending Triangle, presaging an important
decline, is shown Fig. III.9. Glidden had worked up in the post-panic recovery in
1930 to over 37. From its peak on March 20 (point A on our chart) it made a series of
reactions and recoveries – each reaction bringing the price down to around 34–341/2,
but each following rally failing to carry up quite as high as the preceding. Thus we
had the first indication of a turn in the upward movement – the formation of a Right-
angle Triangle with a descending hypotenuse (from A to B to C to D), and with the
other leg extending horizontally through E, F and G.
Note that we already had within this pattern,
before any break-out occurred, a strong suggestion

that case, we should have had to wait for the break-out before knowing which direc-
tion prices would take. By the same token, if the upper leg had extended out hori-
zontally, and the lower leg had slanted strongly upward, the forecast would have
been one of continuation of the previous up-trend rather than reversal. In brief, if we
recognized this typical descending pattern as it developed, and if we happened to
be ‘‘long’’ of Glidden stock we should have been warranted in selling and taking our
profit at once.
Volume on Initial Break-out Not Essential
Before taking a short position in a stock, however, it is safest always to wait for the
break-out. In our Glidden chart prices broke out and closed out of the pattern on
April 24 – with no increase in volume. On the following day, the price movement
was conclusive but volume was not. This low volume action on the initial break-out
is a frequent occurrence with Right-angle Triangle Reversals, differing in that
respect from the break-outs with decisive pick-up in volume which we demand of
Symmetrical Triangles before taking a position. Since the Descending Right-angle
Triangle is already expressing a growing technical weakness in the market, it follows
naturally that no excessive selling is required to push prices out of the pattern. The
support along the level of the bottom leg eventually has to give way. Consequently,
any closing of prices by a fair margin out of the bottom of the pattern – in the direc-
tion which the pattern has already forecast– may be considered a valid break-out and a
sufficient signal to sell.
We do not mean to imply that this failure of volume to appear on the initial break-
out of Right-angle Triangles is the rule, for it is not; in the majority of cases, perhaps,
a sharp volume increase accompanies the break and usually the price movement is
proportionate. What we do wish to bring out is that we need not wait for a volume
signal to confirm an otherwise valid break-out on the down side from a good
Descending Triangle (or on the up-side from an Ascending Triangle).
Out-of-Line Movements
In the preceding paragraph, however, note that we specified ‘‘an otherwise valid
break-out’’, meaning a break-out closing out of the pattern by the decisive margin
which we discussed in Study II, page 60 under the heading ‘‘Wait for Clear Confir-
mation’’. The need for this caution is shown by our next example, the Descending
Triangle Reversal in Nash Motors in 1929 (Fig. III.10).
Nash reached its top on August 5 (over two months before the majority of stocks
made their final spurt) where it showed a typical one-day reversal. Thereafter, it
formed a large Descending Triangle with horizontal leg or support line at the 84

level. On September 12, this support line was pierced but by only half a point; on the
following day the price fell a full point below the boundary line but worked back
and closed the day inside the pattern.
After the 14th of September prices ranged within the pattern and did not break
out again for nearly a week. Not until September 21 did we get a break confirmed
by volume. (Here, again, doubling the Saturday volume gives us our clue.)
Such brief out-of-line movements (of prices) as occurred in Nash on September 12
and 13, are by no means a rare phenomenon in Right-angle Triangles. They are not
to be classed as false movements since they break out, in fact, in the same direction
as the anticipated true movement. More often than not, the out-of-line movement
occurs all within a single day and is then called a ‘‘one-day out-of-line’’.
It is reasonable to assume in the case of the out-of-line movement in Nash, that
professional interests engaged in distributing a large quantity of the stock were sup-
porting the price at or around 84, withdrawing their offers whenever this level was
approached. On September 12, however, the market in Nash had developed so
much technical weakness that the movement got out of hand for a couple of days;
probably the operators in Nash had to do some buying at this time to prevent a col-
lapse and permit them to complete their distribution at profitable levels. This expla-
nation is, possibly, too simple to account for all out-of-line movements but, as we
have noted before, the exact explanation does not matter so long as we recognize the
phenomenon and are not misled by it.
Taking a Short Position
From our study of the out-of-line movement we can now see why it is safest to wait
for a decisive break-out before selling a stock short. In the case of Nash we should
have been safe in closing out a long position and taking our profit it as soon as we
were reasonably certain that a Descending Triangle was in process of formation. But
if we had sold the stock short at, say, 831/2on the strength of the piercing of the sup-
port boundary on September 12 and had placed a stop-loss order at, say, 85, our stop
would have gone into effect a few days later and our transaction would have been
closed out with a small loss. By waiting for a decisive break we avoided that risk.
(The value and placing of Stop-Loss Orders will be taken up in Study XI.)
Effect of General Market on Individual Issues
The Nash Chart (Fig. III.10) illustrates not only the occurrence of out-of-line move-
ment, but also another phenomenon which is worth a little attention at this point
although a full discussion of it belongs more properly in our later consideration of
market tactics.

==================================================

STUDY III
Note that the downward movement in Nash, after the break-out on September 21,
ran into buying very quickly and was halted for nearly a month around the 79 level.
The technical trader who sold Nash short on the break-out might have been con-
cerned about the correctness of his position during this waiting period before the
down movement was resumed. Quick halts and periods of congestion following a
break-out from a strong reversal pattern are often attributable to a ‘‘braking’’ effect
which the strength of the market as a whole has at times upon the weakness of an
individual stock (or vice-versa). What happened in Nash at the time of our chart was
very plainly due to the fact that Nash made its top in early August, whereas the
majority of stocks in which the public was actively trading during those epic days
did not make their tops until the last half of September, and the general market did
not make its last spurt until October. Nash had headed downward definitely in
August but the general market was still strong; the new owners of the Nash stock
that had been distributed during August and early September were under no pres-
sure to liquidate and the strength of the general market probably led them to believe
that their stock would go higher again. Consequently, the downward trend in Nash,
already so clearly forecast in our technical pattern, did not get into its stride, so to
speak, until the whole market changed its tone.
This ‘‘braking’’ effect of the general market on a single stock’s technical action is a
phenomenon which occurs just often enough to create doubts in the mind of the
inexperienced technical trader, and this has led us to discuss it briefly here.
A similar action in the opposite trend may be observed by the student who cares
to look up and analyze the charts of leading Copper stocks in the early Spring of
1936. Several of them developed very strong patterns indicating a good mark-up
impending. But the whole market at this same time began to show technical weak-
ness, culminating in the April drop (amounting to almost 20 points in the Dow Jones
industrial average) which may be seen in the frontispiece. The strong technical posi-
tion of the Coppers was held in check until the general market correction had run its
course; then, however, it made itself felt in an extremely rapid advance that more
than made up for all the lost time and setbacks.
Ascending Triangle Reversals
Just as the Descending type of Right-angle Triangle forecasts the reversal of an
upward into a downward trend, so the Ascending Triangle forecasts the reversal of
a downward trend into a stage of mark-up. Everything we have noted above in our
study of Descending Triangles, applies as well to the Ascending Triangle when it
occurs in a downward trend, although the forecast is, of course, reversed.
Figure III.11 shows the Right-angle Triangle (A-B-C) of the ascending type which
forecast the change to an upward price trend in Hudson Motors in the Fall of 1933.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
It is interesting to observe the tendency of prices to lift away from the hypotenuse
(A-C) as the apex of the Triangle was approached, suggesting a rapid accumulation
of technical strength. There was an attempt to pierce the resistance line B-C on
November 20 with good volume, emphasizing the growing strength of the picture.
Another push on November 25 and 27 carried the price out of the pattern but the
decisive break did not come until December 1. The stock halted at 15, built a strong
continuation Ascending Triangle, and then moved up rapidly to 23.
Figure III.12 depicts an Ascending Triangle Reversal in Johns Manville which
came at the end of the April drop in 1936. The technical student may see in this the
suggestion of a Head and Shoulders bottom, with the head formed at C and a long
double right shoulder (E and G), but the pattern is, at best, irregular, and most
observers would see it more readily as an Ascending Triangle. The failure of the
recession from H to carry back down to the hypotenuse before turning up again at
F, indicated rapidly growing technical strength. The gap in prices at J (discussed
later on under the subject of Break-away Gaps) further emphasized the importance
of the rise to follow.
Right-angle Triangles in Weekly Charts
Descending Triangles are fairly common at the end of long-range major uptrends.
The Ascending Triangle appears less frequently at the bottom of major down-trends,
but is just as important and valid when it does appear.
A good example of a Descending Triangle Reversal on a weekly chart is pictured
in Fig. III.13.
The Wedge Formation
Related to the Triangle in appearance at least, although probably brought into being
by an entirely different set of fundamental causes, is the Wedge Formation. It
belongs in our discussion of Reversals because it forecasts a reversal of the trend in
which it is formed, but it is not so easy to explain
why it should act the way it does.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
toms if the prevailing trend is down) but the spread between minor tops and bot-
toms grows less and less until the stock is fluctuating within a much narrower range
than is its normal habit. The forming of the Wedge is accompanied by a progressive
perceptible decrease in activity, the declining volume as the pattern tapers to its
point being analogous to the declining volume that accompanies the forming of a
Triangle.
Somewhere near the theoretical tip or apex of the Wedge, prices break away from
the pattern, with or without volume increase according to its direction. Thereafter,
prices move away, more or less rapidly, in a trend oppositeto that which formed the
Wedge.
Examples of the Wedge Formation
Before proceeding to a further analysis of the Wedge pattern we had best get its
appearance fixed in mind by reference to typical examples. Figure III.14 shows a
Wedge formation in New York Central in 1931. Note the price trend working up dur-
ing January and February in a clearly-defined, narrowing track bounded by the lines
A-C and B-C. At the same time, the volume (except for two lone days of sharp rally,
Feb. 10 and Feb. 21) is very gradually but perceptibly declining. On February 29
prices broke out of, and well away from, the pattern on the down side, with a spurt
in activity that is conspicuous when we follow the rule of doubling Saturday’s vol-
ume. The decline that followed carried New York Central from 124 to 74 in three
months’ time, although a movement of this extent is by no means always indicated
by the Wedge pattern. However, the rapid break-away and decisive movement in
the new trend is typical of the Up-Turned Wedge Reversal.
Up-turned and Down-turned Wedges Compared
Figure III.15 shows a Down-turned Wedge which formed in the daily chart of Elec-
tric Auto-Lite in the Spring of 1932. Compare the volume picture and price action
following the completion of the Wedge in this chart, with the New York Central
chart (Fig. III.14). Note the indecisive and dull period which followed the turn of
prices out of the Down-pointed Wedge pattern before the new upward trend really
started; this is typical of the price (and volume) action to be expected following a
Down-turned Wedge, and is, as we have seen, quite different from the characteristic
action following the Up-turned formation. Each presages a reversal of trend, but the
move is delayed for an indefinite period in the case of many Down-turned Wedges.
The practical trader will therefore take prompt action when his chart shows a break-
out from an Up-Pointed Wedge Top; whereas he may safely delay action at a Bottom
until the price and volume action indicate that the new uptrend is really started.

STUDY III
The Wedge Must be Strictly Defined
A word of caution to the student is in order at this time. The Wedge Pattern is reli-
able as a reversal formation only when it conforms strictly to the description given
herein. The boundaries of the Wedge must be clearly defined and well filled with
price action. The Wedge must point sharplyup or down. A converging pattern which
is projected on the chart in a nearly horizontal direction is more apt to partake of the
nature of a true Triangle, and the student will note that the forecast in that case
would be quite different.
The Wedge, in fact, is not a common formation. It is taken up here in connection
with our study of the important reversal patterns only because of its pictorial simi-
larity to the triangle, and its reliability when it is strictly defined.
Summary of the Triangle Reversal Group
Let us now review the Triangles and related formations which may indicate a rever-
sal of price trend, which we have been studying in this section of our Course.
The Symmetrical Triangle may signal either a reversal or a continuation of the pre-
vious trend, the latter more often than the former. It
does not tell us, in itself, which direction the subse-

description.
The Right-angle Triangle also appears more fre-
quently as an intermediate or continuation forma-
tion than as a reversal, but, unlike the Symmetrical pattern, it does give us a fairly
reliable intimation, in advance of the break-out, as to the direction of the next move.
Right-angle Triangles with the hypotenuse slanting upward from the origin of the
pattern are called Ascending Triangles and are ‘‘bullish’’. Those in which the
hypotenuse slants downward from its origin are called Descending Triangles and
are ‘‘bearish’’.
Wedges are clearly defined patterns of converging price trend, pointed sharply up
or down; they forecast a reversal of the trend which forms them.
All of these formations are generally characterized by progressively declining vol-
ume as prices converge toward the apex, with a sharp pick-up when they break out
of pattern and the new move gets under way.
We have noted that the Wedge must conform strictly to rule but that a certain
amount of latitude is permissible in construing the Triangles. It will not be out of
place, however, to add here the advice to the beginner that he confine his trading at

the start to only those situations where the pattern and its forecast are reasonably
clear, and to await more data and experience before attempting to fit definite pat-
terns to any more loosely constructed and irregular areas of price congestion.
Probable Causes for Triangles
Before closing our study of this group of Reversal patterns it will be interesting to
discuss briefly the probable factors of supply and demand which produce them.
The Symmetrical Triangle is typically a picture of hesitation, doubt, or delay pend-
ing some event that will clarify the stock’s prospects for the future. It does not nec-
essarily indicate manipulation or even concerted inside trading. One of the sets of
factors which may produce a Symmetrical Triangle is exemplified by the large pat-
terns which developed in the charts of several large utility holding companies prior
to the 1936 national elections, starting several months before. In other cases the hes-
itation may be due only to a temporary exhaustion of buying – or selling – and a dis-
position on the part of traders to catch their breath and hold fast until they can
re-appraise the situation.
The Right-Angle Triangles, on the other hand, do indicate some degree of con-
certed inside action. The Descending Triangle plainly pictures increasing offers of
the stock met by a more or less definitely organized willingness to buy at a certain
demand or support level. The Ascending Triangle pictures growing buying power
meeting more or less organized selling at a certain resistance or supply level.
In the case of the Descending Triangle we may have, as was suggested in connec-
tion with the Nash chart Fig. III.10, certain interests engaged in distributing large
holdings of the stock to the public and ‘‘supporting’’ the market at a certain level
until they have unloaded all their shares. The level at which they throw in their sup-
port by bidding in any stock offered at that price, becomes the horizontal bottom leg
of our Triangle. In the case of the Ascending Triangle we have, on the other hand, a
picture of professional accumulation. The interests engaged in buying do not want
to attract any public following until they have acquired a substantial quantity of the
stock, so they ‘‘resist’’ any rise in prices beyond a certain level by throwing part of
their accumulation back on the market whenever bids reach that level.
As their buying progresses and they pick up the floating supply in weak hands,
they find less and less of the stock available at low prices; hence the upward slant of
the bottom leg of our Triangle. Finally, a point is reached where they would be
obliged to sell out too much of their accumulation to prevent prices from rising
above the level they are willing to pay. Their ‘‘resistance’’, which caused the hori-
zontal top leg of our Triangle, is then withdrawn. Other buyers now find the weak
floating supply exhausted and are forced to raise their bids sharply to secure any of
the stock; the sudden upward movement attracts the attention of still other buyers

and the mark-up stage appears on our chart.
It must not be taken for granted, of course, that every Ascending Triangle is
brought into being by the operations of a single powerful trader or a single orga-
nized group. There may, for example, be several interests or large operators engaged
in accumulation independent of each other, while other groups who are not so opti-
mistic about the stock’s prospects are, consequently, willing to distribute their hold-
ings whenever the price reaches a certain level. The net result, so far as the chart
shows, is the same.
The factors which produce the less common Wedge formation are difficult to ana-
lyze. The most important factor in its creation is probably a shrinkage of activity in
the stock as the feeling grows that it is temporarily over-running its true relation to
underlying values. However, as we have remarked before, the causes are not impor-
tant so long as we know the probable effects.
The next study will take up other reversal patterns of a more complex nature.

The Four Previous Reversal Patterns

take of various shapes and patterns but that, in the end, they are all varying aspects

a less regular, more pointed, more widely swinging
or vibrating reversal; that the Triangle, while not
always a reversal formation, often manifests itself as such, by a sort of wearing out
of the previous move and consequent reduction in activity; but that the Wedge,
occurring more rarely, is hard to explain on any logical basis yet gives us a thor-
oughly reliable reversal forecast.
A Much Misunderstood Formation
We come now to a formation which is one of the most loosely and glibly discussed
of all reversal patterns – the Double Top (or, in its opposite manifestation, the Dou-
ble Bottom). The layman who has followed the financial columns in the daily papers
or listened to board room gossip has undoubtedly heard it mentioned frequently. It
is referred to so often by superficial writers that the beginner is likely to believe it a
common and reliable indication of technical reversal, requiring little study. Unfor-
tunately, this is not the case. Neither Double Tops nor Double Bottoms are as reliable
in forecasting a major reversal of trend as the surface authorities might lead us to
believe. Probably not more than a third of them signaled reversal; and most of the
patterns which are popularly alluded to as ‘‘looking like a Double Top’’, carry no
such suggestion to the informed student.
Nevertheless, the true Double Top and true Double Bottom, and their related pat-
terns, do appear frequently enough as reversals of major trends to find a place in our
discussion of the standard and important reversal formations. We must study first
how to recognize the development of what may turn out to be a genuine Double Top
Reversal.
Relation to Preceding Price Movement
One of the first considerations in interpreting the Double Top pattern is the extent of

STUDY IV
the movement which preceded it. If the stock has been in a long-continued up-trend,
the Double Top is more likely to develop into a reversal. If, on the other hand, the
preceding movement has been short, then the apparent Double Top is more likely to
be broken and the upward trend continued. In this connection, the formations
appearing on our other charts and in the averages also are helpful; if they are show-
ing signs of an important reversal in trend we may suspect a true Double Top is
forming.
Other helpful indications appear in the pattern itself.
How the Typical Double Top Forms
Frequently in very active markets, a stock will work up rapidly to a peak accompa-
nied by high volume and then, without building any apparent reversal formation,
drop off for several points and remain, more or less inactively, at a lower price level
for several weeks. This is followed by another run-up with increased volume to
approximately the same level as the preceding top, and again the stock backs away
with volume again declining. The two sharp advances, meeting a large volume of
selling at about the same level, appear now to have exhausted the buying power in
the stock. It declines to the level of the previous reaction between the two tops, often
hesitates there for a time, and then drops off in the new downward trend with vol-
ume usually increasing as the movement progresses.
Before entering into a detailed discussion of the significant points in the typical
Double Top pattern described above, it will be helpful to study a few examples.
Examples of Double Top Reversals
Figure IV.1 shows a nearly perfect Double Top which formed in American Radiator
and Standard Sanitary in 1929. The price movement which preceded this formation
is not shown on our chart; probably, however, the student does not need to be told
that the stock had been in a ‘‘bull’’ trend for many months before and was marked
up very rapidly during the first half of 1929. In July it made its first top at 541/2with
a large volume of transactions taking place around that price level. It dropped off
precipitately from this first top and fluctuated for five weeks between 45 and 49 with
comparatively little volume. In the first week of September it was again marked up
rapidly on very high volume, reaching for one day a level slightly higher than the
preceding top, but failing to penetrate it by a margin we should regard as significant.
The movement that followed requires no special comment.
Figure IV. 2 shows another good example of the Double Top which formed in
Houdaille-Hershey-B in the Spring of 1930. This stock had made a strong advance
from the panic low to over 28 in the first week of February. The top at that level was

accompanied by extraordinary volume. Dropping back quickly to 24, it began
another very gradual advance with several days of high activity around the 27 level.
On April 9 it touched 287/8but dropped back and closed at the bottom of the day’s
price range, making a one-day reversal on high volume which, as we have seen in
Study II, frequently indicates a change in trend. This second top completed the Dou-
ble Top Reversal, and the stock dropped off rapidly to 10 (and lower, later).
The picture in Houdaille-Hershey-B is not so typical in every respect of the true
Double Top Reversal as that shown in American
Radiator, but both conform in their important fea-

borhood of 20% from their top levels in the interval
between their two tops. In each case, a period of sev-
eral weeks of decreased activity elapsed before the first top was again approached.
In each case the second top, accompanied by high volume, was made quickly at
approximately the same level as the first. All of these points require some brief con-
sideration in our study of the practical use of the Double Top formation.
To begin with the first top, the factor of volume is important. We have noted in
Study II the general rule of high volume at points of reversal, and we must expect
this rule to apply quite strictly in the case of a true Double Top. The second top is
also made, as a rule, on noticeably high volume but this volume need not be as great
as that which accompanied the making of the first top, and it is often made on only
a slight increase over the average volume during the interval between the tops. It is
not necessary that the two tops be made at exactly the same level; the second top
may rise slightly above or fail by a small margin to attain the highest point of the first
top. A difference of a full point in the case of a stock selling under 100 does not inval-
idate the pattern. The general level of the two tops should be approximately the
same, taking into account the price level and normal habits of the stock under study.
More important even than the volume factor, is the matter of the extent of the
decline from the first top and the duration of the interval between tops. The decline
should be of some consequence in terms of the stock’s price level. We have men-
tioned the fact that this decline amounted to approximately 20% in each of the two
examples shown so far. It might be considerably more but it should not be a great
deal less than that, percentage-wise, to make a good Double Top Reversal. And,
there should be more than just a few days’ elapse before the second attempt is made
to run the stock up through the previous top level. Speaking very generally, the
longer the time interval between the two tops, the more important the pattern
becomes as a signal of a major reversal.

STUDY IV
The forecast of such reversal may be considered to be definitely confirmed when
the price drops back and penetrates by a decisive margin the low range made dur-
ing the interval between the tops.
The Double Top formation may be compared to successive assaults made by an
army on a strongly defended enemy line. The first attack is made in force but is
stopped short and quickly repulsed. The attackers drop back to a safe position, con-
solidate their forces, rest and gather strength for another assault on the enemy
trenches. Again the charge is made; the first line of enemy trenches may be slightly
penetrated or the attack may be stopped before it quite attains that objective; in any
event the attack is repulsed and, this time, the beaten army has spent its strength and
retreats in defeat. The tide of battle has turned. To carry our analogy further, the
longer the time spent in preparation and the greater the force exerted in the second
onset, the more decisive and significant is the failure to pierce the enemy line.
The student may, if he chooses, apply this comparison with an attacking army to
our further study of variations in the Double Top or Double Bottom patterns.
Shorter Intervals Between Tops
Figure IV.3 shows a Double Top which formed in Pullman in 1932. It will be noted
that this picture does not comply with our requirements for a major reversal in one
important respect: the time between the two tops is too short. Despite the other ele-
ments in the pattern which do conform to the Double Top definition, this one defect
should have made us doubt that any extensive movement of Pullman in a new
down trend would result. The downward move was, in fact, halted too quickly to
permit any but the most nimble of ‘‘scalpers’’ to profit by it.
This Pullman chart is included in our study to illustrate the danger in making a
heavy commitment in a stock on the strength of a Double Top which does not con-
form in all respects to the requirements we have set up for a true reversal formation.
It must be admitted, however, that stocks do occasionally reverse their trend after
making two tops only a few days apart. In many of these cases there are other for-
mations in the chart which give a more dependable clue to the reversal – an Inverted
Descending Triangle, for example, which we shall take up in a later Study. In fact,
the closer together the two tops stand on the chart the more likely they are both to
be elements of but a single technical pattern which may, as it develops, indicate
either a reversal or a continuation. The reader will find plenty of instances in the
charts illustrating these studies – those that have preceded as well as all to follow –
where stocks make two tops at approximately the same level but quite close
together, and no reversal follows.
As for these rare cases where a major reversal does follow no apparent pattern
except what might, by a stretch of the imagination, be considered a Double Top

STUDY IV
formed within a few days of high activity, it must be recalled that many important
moves take place without any forecasting patterns appearing on the chart. This is
particularly true in very thin and erratic stocks in which the technical factors of sup-
ply and demand can change with great rapidity, although it may happen in any
issue at times. The technical trader is well advised to watch for genuine and depend-
able chart patterns, of which there will always be plenty, and to pass up the doubt-
ful pictures.
(To digress for a moment, the reader may find it interesting to observe in Fig. IV.3
the small Symmetrical Triangle which formed at the second top in Pullman in the
first week of October. This was a good clear pattern, forecasting reversal, but its
small size, plus the brief extent of the move which led up to it, indicated that only a
limited decline would follow.)
Examples of Double Bottoms
The Double Bottom is, of course, the Double Top turned upside down, and is sub-
ject to the same conditions and same interpretations. The volume to be expected on
the two bottoms is typically less than we should expect at tops, but the relativevol-
ume at the bottoms, and during the interval between them, follows the same rules
as for the formation of a genuine Double Top. When a Double Bottom, meeting all
the specifications we have analyzed above, appears on our charts we are warranted
in predicting an advance of goodly proportions to follow. This type of formation
gave technical students clear warning of a reversal out of the sharp declines in many
leading stocks in the Spring of 1936, and of the long profitable advance to follow.
Figs IV.4 and IV.5 on the following pages are excellent examples. We suggest that the
student examine these carefully, checking price, volume and timing with the speci-
fications laid down for testing the reliability of a Double Top, and noting further, as
a point of interest, the typical halt or congestion of the new upward trend at or near
the level of the farthest extent of prices between the two bottoms.
Multiple Tops and Bottoms
Technical factors similar to those which produce Double Tops and Bottoms, may on
occasions produce triple and sometimes even quadruple or quintuple formations
having the same implications. The tops (or bottoms) in these multiple patterns are
characteristically closer together than is the case with true Double Reversals, and it
is perfectly logical that this should be so. If we may once again employ our compar-
ison with an attacking army, we should naturally expect that a large number of
unsuccessful assaults on an impregnable enemy position, even though each were
delivered with comparatively little power and with little time taken for gathering of

forces between, would eventually wear down the besiegers and throw them into
rout. In any event, whether or not the analogy is fairly drawn, it is safe to assume in
the technical analysis of our charts that, whenever prices attempt and fail to pene-
trate certain levels on successive occasions, each failure adds weight to the indica-
tions of reversal; also that the longer the attack persists the greater the importance
of the move to follow.
However, it should be noted that many chart pictures which show multiple tops
or bottoms are more correctly to be regarded as falling into the classification of some
other, perhaps more dependable, technical formation which may even have an
opposite implication ... for example, a Right-Angle Continuation Triangle.
Volume Action in Multiple Reversals
In those cases which permit of no other construction – where the only clear picture
is one of Multiple Tops or Multiple Bottoms – high volume accompanies the forma-
tion of the first reversal but thereafter the volume picture is usually confused and
irregular, offering little aid in forecasting until it again picks up sharply as prices
break away into the new trend. Figure IV.6 shows a Multiple Top which reversed the
trend in Timken Roller Bearing early in 1931. Four successive rallies in a period of
about six weeks failed to carry the stock above 59. The first top was made on good
volume but note that it took the form of a one-day reversal – in itself a caution sig-
nal. However, perhaps the first confirmation of a major reversal – making this a Mul-
tiple Top pattern – was the breaking of prices on April 7th down through the level
at 52 of the minor bottoms which followed the making of the first two tops; this
break it will be noted occurred on volume appreciably higher than the average for
over two weeks before. The decline took prices down to 32 in the first week in June.
At this time a formation developed which might be construed as a weak and rather
doubtful Double Bottom, but really is better interpreted as a Symmetrical Triangle
reversal followed by a type of false movement which we shall refer to in a later study
as an ‘‘End Run’’.
An Illustration of a False Double Top
Note also in the 1931 Chart of Timken Roller Bearing the tops made at 48 in the first
part of January and again in the last week of that month. Here is an excellent exam-
ple of the type of price action which is so often referred to by superficial chartists as
a Double Top. In fact, we haven’t the slightest doubt that more than one market com-
mentator mentioned this very action on January 29th with the remark ‘‘TKR looks
as though it had made a Double Top’’. The student of this Course will quickly see

that neither the interval of time nor the extent of the reaction between the two tops
bear out the Double Top interpretation.
He will see also that these minor tops were actually constructing the horizontal
top or ‘‘resistance’’ boundary of an Ascending Triangle which called for higher
prices rather than a reversal at this stage.
A Multiple Bottom Formation
Figure IV.7 illustrates a Multiple Bottom Reversal, fairly typical of this formation,
which appeared in the Chrysler chart in May, 1936. The first bottom (at 913/4) was
made with high volume on April 30, but note that the closing transaction on this day
was at 951/2), the very top of the day’s price range – a perfect example of a one-day
reversal which, in itself, gave warning that the previous trend had run its course,
although this action alone did not warrant a conservative trader’s taking a ‘‘long’’
position. On May 12, Chrysler again touched 913/4and again bounced back. Selling
pressure once more forced the price down on May 19 to 921/2practically the level of
the previous bottoms. The first suggestion that this chart was developing a good
multiple bottom came on May 26 when prices closed well above the levels reached
by the previous minor rallies. The volume at this stage was not conclusive, however,
and another and a final attempt to penetrate the previous bottoms had to be made
before Chrysler’s growing technical strength finally won out and the new up-trend
was definitely established. An ultra-conservative trader would get all the confirma-
tion he might ask in the decisive break-away of prices from congestion on June 20 if
he remembered to double the Saturday volume.
Double Tops and Bottoms on Long-range charts
Good Double Tops are by no means uncommon in weekly and monthly charts of
individual issues. Good Double Bottoms also appear, and apparently with greater
frequency than Tops. In both phases they are of greater academic than practical
interest. (Refer back to our discussion in Study II of the Head and Shoulders forma-
tion in weekly and monthly charts.) The volume indications are, quite naturally,
lacking on weekly charts, especially in the case of Double Bottoms, because the vol-
ume on break-outs, etc. usually comes on one or two days only and does not show
up conspicuously in the week’s total.
Figure IV.8 shows a fine Double Bottom pattern in a weekly chart of American
Bank Note. The two bottoms at the 11–12 price level occurring a year apart might
conceivably bear no relation to each other yet it is reasonable to assume that a ‘‘stone
wall’’ of resistance based on sound fundamentals did (and possibly still does) exist
at that level, and that it did turn the stock back and form the foundation for the long

turn of the year by a strong Symmetrical Continua-
tion Triangle. The second bottom, in the fall of 1934,
was part of an excellent Head and Shoulders formation, with shoulders in July and
December.
‘‘M’’ and ‘‘W’’ Formations
Certain financial writers have in the past referred to chart pictures bearing a fancied
resemblance to the capital letters ‘‘M’’ and ‘‘W’’ as distinct reversal patterns. How-
ever, careful examination and study of many hundreds of stock charts leads us to
consider the ‘‘M’’ and ‘‘W’’ formations as simply rather natural and not uncommon
variants of the Double Top and Double Bottom, respectively. Generally speaking,
the same requirements as to volume action, extent of price movement and timing
apply, and the interpretation is the same.
The ‘‘M’’ formation is a Double Top in which prices move up very sharply to the
first top and down at an equally sharp angle from the second top, and form, in the
interval between the two tops a fairly deep V-shaped price track. The illusion of a
capital ‘‘M’’ is further carried out in many cases by the halt or congestion which we
have learned to expect in many charts at about the level of the bottom formed
between the two tops. As might be expected, the ‘‘M’’ formation appears usually in
stocks that have habitually rapid movements and sudden reversals in trend.
The ‘‘W’’ formation is simply the ‘‘M’’ turned upside down, and is a similar vari-
ant of the Double Bottom. The weekly chart of American Bank Note (Fig. IV.8) pic-
tures a good example of the ‘‘W’’ type of Double Bottom, and so does the daily chart
of American Locomotive (Fig. IV.5).
Rarely also a good ‘‘W’’ picture will appear in a Triple Top Reversal; its forecast-
ing value differs in no wise from that of any strong Multiple Top. Such a ‘‘W’’ vari-
ety of Triple Top is illustrated in the chart of National Power and Light for the first
half of 1931, shown in Fig. IV.9. Remember to double the volume shown on the chart
for Saturday, March 28, when studying the volume action in this illustration.

STUDY IV
writers speak so confidently about the Double Top and Double Bottom as a positive
indication of a reversal is because there have actually been several occasions when
Double formations appeared in the widely published average charts at the end of
long bull or bear markets. The most notable example which writers are prone to sub-
mit is the close of the bear market of 1921 which does show, with a little imagination,
a satisfactory example of the Double Bottom.
Going back still further on the Dow-Jones Industrial average, we find that Double
Bottoms apparently ended the long bear markets in 1897, 1903, and in 1914–15. Dou-
ble Tops are no less common at the close of long bull markets, notably in the Indus-
trials in 1899 and 1906, and in the Rails in 1918–19.
Attention is called rather naturally, however, to those formations, because they
stand out as reversals in the chart picture, but we must call the reader’s attention
also to the myriad additional multiple formations occurring in the long-term aver-
age charts which might have been reversals but were not. And because they were
notreversals they melt into the general picture and are comparatively unnoticed by
the casual observer.
Despite this slightly optical illusion, however, the Double formations do appear
quite logically to have greater reversal strength and importance when appearing in
the averages than when noted merely in the chart history of an individual issue.
The Complex Pattern – a Reliable Forecaster
The sixth type of reversal formation, which we are now ready to study, is the Com-
plex Formation and it allies itself strongly with the Head and Shoulders and the
Common or Rounding Turn patterns as being a reliable forecaster, in itself, of a
reversal from the previous trend into a new direction of price movement. The Com-
plex Formation is, in addition, one of the strongest of all our reversal patterns. It
stands so far ahead of the others in this respect that if it were a more common devel-
opment it would, with little doubt, take the crown of importance away from the
Head and Shoulders formation, and lead our entire list of reversal pictures.
The Complex Reversal is, as a matter of fact, merely a stronger, longer and more
detailed form of the Head and Shoulders picture. For that reason it is found less fre-
quently but, also for that reason, it is one of our most reliable indicators of definite
reversals in the comparatively rare cases where it isfound.
The Complex Formation divide themselves into two more detailed aspects of the
Head and Shoulders pattern. These are the shoulders and multiple head type, and
the head and multiple shoulders type. Their appelations suggest rather clearly their
definitions. The shoulders and multiple head form is simply our old friend the Head
and Shoulders, but with a double, or multiple, head. The head and multiple shoul-
ders form is also like the regulation Head and Shoulders picture but while the head

is single, the shoulders are in multiples. Both of these Complex Formations are
reversals and they appear, therefore, either as tops or bottoms.
Relation to the Double Tops and Bottoms
In addition to its close relation to the Head and Shoulders formation, the Shoulders
and Multiple Head classification partakes also, of course, of the nature of the Multi-
ple formations which we have just studied – especially the Double Tops and the
Double Bottoms. However, the Complex pattern we are now considering, when it
has two or more heads, makes these heads too close together to be defined as a Dou-
ble or a Multiple Top. Moreover, the Complex Formation, as we have stated above,
is stronger than the Multiple Formation and is more quickly recognized, permitting
us to take a somewhat quicker and more profitable trading position.
The Double Head and Shoulders Top
We have noted in our introduction to the Complex patterns that they are not com-
mon; ideal formations, perfect in every respect, are indeed extremely rare. We may,
therefore, be pardoned if we go back in the files for a classic example in order to give
our readers a first look at this interesting formation. Incidentally, this illustration
serves also to point the fact that previous bull market produced the same technical
pattern we found in 1929, and are finding today.
Figure IV.10 shows the price action in Crucible Steel from November, 1922 to May,
1923. (A reference to the long-term chart of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average at the
beginning of this Course shows that a general reversal in the market occurred at this
time.) In November, 1922, Crucible Steel after a rapid drop down to 60 from above
80, reversed its trend with a perfect Head and Shoulders pattern of the ordinary type
at A-B-C. Thereafter the stock worked up in a few months to 82 at point D, where it
met resistance and formed the left shoulder of our Double Head and Shoulders Top.
After a brief reaction the stock succeeded in getting up through that one previous
point of resistance but was again stopped dead on two successive occasions, points
E and F, at the 841/2level. The stock backed away once more from the double head
and, finally, staged one more rally to point G, the right shoulder, in a vain effort to
renew the advance. But selling pressure was now too strong; the technical balance
had definitely changed and, at H, the neck-base line was broken and the reversal for-
mation was completed.

of shoulders in as nearly perfect form as we are likely ever to encounter it. With this
typical picture in mind, we may now proceed to a consideration of its more proba-
ble variations.
The Shoulders and Double Head occurs with the same differences in width and
height of shoulders as the simple Head and Shoulders pattern. The neck-base line
may slope up or down although the extremes in this respect do not appear so often.
The two heads may be made at slightly different price levels. Generally speaking,
however, the symmetry of the pattern is well maintained and the student will find
the ‘‘rhythm’’ developed by these Complex Formations interesting to observe.
Fig IV.11 shows a rather unusual yet perfectly valid – and extremely powerful –
Shoulders and Double Head Top that reversed the major trend in Chesapeake and
Ohio in 1929. In this the two heads, B and C are made at different levels yet are
clearly related and clearly twin heads. The left shoulder at A is unusually high and
is characterized by an ‘‘Island Reversal’’, a valuable forecasting formation which we
shall take up in detail in Study V and which in itself signaled the exhaustion of
‘‘good’’ buying. The rhythm of the pattern is notable.
Trading on the Shoulders and Double Head
Conservative traders may, and we think that beginners should, follow the rule laid
down in our discussion of the common Head and Shoulders pattern, of waiting for
the breaking of the neck base line before selling the stock, or buying in the case of a
bottom pattern. However, due to the characteristic symmetry of these Complex pat-
terns, it is frequently possible to anticipate the break-out, especially when the previ-
ous chart picture or other considerations suggest the probability of a reversal. In the
Chesapeake and Ohio top, for example, after the emphatic reaction on Saturday,
October 19 from the top of the right shoulder at D, the picture was sufficiently defi-
nite to warrant selling the stock. Obviously, in this particular case several extra
points of profit would have been gained.
However, before attempting to ‘‘jump the gun’’, the trader should be certain of his
picture. If it is not entirely clear, if it is not patently symmetrical, if the retreat from
the right shoulder is not plainly evident, wait for break-out confirmation.
Let the student not take from the above remarks, which apply only to the perfectly
symmetrical Complex Reversals, any implied permission to ‘‘jump the gun’’ with
the simple Head and Shoulders formation which is not completed and does not sig-
nal a reversal until the neck base line is broken.
Head and Multiple Shoulders Types
This division of the Complex Reversals is somewhat more common than the type

that has two or more heads and only a single pair of shoulders which we have just
discussed. In fact, multiple Shoulders show up ‘‘under the microscope’’ in a great
many patterns ordinarily classed as simple Head and Shoulders reversals. (Note, for
example, in Fig. II.2 the two sets of shoulders A-C and G-I, in the chart of Western
Union.)
The rule of rhythm or symmetry applies to this type as well as to the multiple head
type previously discussed, although it is sometimes necessary to look very closely
to find the proof, and there are, of course, exceptions as there are with all technical
patterns. A Head and Multiple Shoulders Top in the 1931 chart of General Theatres
Equipment is shown in Fig. IV.12; this may be analyzed into three shoulders on the
left, formed in quick succession at A, B, and C, a head at D, and three ‘‘broader’’
shoulders on the right at E, F, and G.
We might extend our discussion and our illustrations of Complex Tops almost
indefinitely, since we can have both multiple heads and multiple shoulders in the
same formation, with all the combinations thereof which the student may work out
and classify if he wishes. Suffice it to say that they are all subject to the same limita-
tions and interpretations as the types we have already considered.
Complex Bottoms in Same Varieties as Tops
We need not consider in detail the Complex Formation as a bottom reversal. Com-
plex Bottoms appear in all the different forms found in Complex Tops, and are
equally strong and reliable as indications of reversal. We can dismiss their study
with a brief analysis of Fig. IV.13. The chart of Pullman in the Fall of 1934 shows a
Complex Bottom Reversal with two distinct heads at C and D and with shoulders at
A-B and E-F. The student may regard these as a single pair of irregular shoulders, or
as two sets of shoulders with the two on the right somewhat confused by the greater
congestion as the formation approached completion. The right shoulder area may
also be construed as a small Symmetrical Triangle, and the decisive price action on
November 7, with a sharp increase in volume, breaks both the Triangle and the neck
of the Complex Reversal, doubly confirming the forecast of higher prices.
The reader has probably noticed the appearance of a Double Bottom in this Pull-
man chart, but as we have already noted in our earlier study, Double Bottoms or
Tops which occur quite close together are almost always elements of a larger pattern
and are best interpreted in the light of the larger and more dependable formation.
Refer back to Fig. II.7, for a Head and Shoulders Bottom which may also be con-
strued as a Complex Formation with one head and two pairs of shoulders, the first
left shoulder forming on September 21. The significance of this chart is in no wise
changed by such a construction, except that the forecast of a reversal is slightly
strengthened.

STUDY IV
Volume Indications in Complex Reversals
The reader has observed, very likely, that we have made practically no comment on
volume action in connection with the Complex patterns. The reason is that no very
definite volume pattern can be depended on to occur during the formation of a
Complex Reversal, due possibly to the very complexity of the formation and the
number of price fluctuations involved in changing the tide of technical strength. We
might say that the Complex pattern looks as though it has difficulty making up its
mind, but when it does decide, the decision carries considerable weight. One gen-
eral rule of volume is carried out with very few exceptions; i.e., the sharp increase
that breaks the neck-base line.
Shoulders at Different Price Levels
We have already commented in Study II on the occurrence of Head and Shoulders
formations with an additional pair of shoulders formed on either side at a much
lower level in the case of tops, or higher in the case of bottoms, than the pair next to
the head. The student will find many examples. We do not classify these as Complex
Formations because the inner pair of shoulders completes the picture, and the break-
ing of the inner neck-base line, which they define, indicates the reversal of trend.
The Broadening Top – a Rare and Intricate Pattern
The Broadening Top is the seventh pattern we shall take up in our study of forma-
tions which appear at major reversals in price trend. Due partly to its rarity and
partly to its intricacy it is unquestionably the most difficult of all to discover and to
analyze. For these same reasons it should possibly be placed at the end of our rever-
sal studies, but we are inserting it here because it seems to form the transitional pic-
ture between the Head and Shoulders types already examined and the Inverted
Triangles which we shall take up in the next section of this Course.
The Broadening Top, in its simplest and purest manifestation, might be described
as a simple Head and Shoulders Top with a downward slanting neck-base line and
a right shoulder reaching up to a higher level than the head. In its less simple (and
more frequently found) form it suggests a triangular pattern faced about, with its
apex at the left or beginning, and its broadest end at the right or completion of the
congestion. It might, in fact, be logically included in the Inverted Triangle classifica-
tion were it not for the fact that it must conform strictly to a certain ‘‘rule of five’’, of
which more later.
When a Broadening Top is found in our charts it has a forecasting value of nearly

the same rank as the Head and Shoulders. Moreover, it usually foretokens a move-
ment of more than average proportions. It allies itself with the Head and Shoulders
and Rounding Turn patterns in that it signifies, within its own formation, a reversal
of the previous trend. It differs from the standard Triangles in that the Broadening
Top does not indicate a continuation whereas the Triangles indicate a continuation
more often than a reversal of the previous trend. Of course, it must be kept ever in
mind that no technical pattern is 100% reliable in forecasting market changes.
Description of the Broadening Top
The Broadening Formation is made up of five separate and distinct minor reversals
of trend, with each reversal going farther than the last, which gives it its character-
istic broadening appearance and which, as we have already noted, causes it to
resemble an Inverted Triangle. But an Inverted Triangle may be built up of any num-
ber of minor reversals whereas a Broadening Top must have five, and only five,
fairly compact, broadening swings of minor or short intermediate price reversal. If
a sixth reversal appears, then the formation is spoiled, and incidentally that sixth
swing carries the previous major movement on into a continuation, whereas we
know that our Broadening Formation, to be called such, must be a reversal of the
previous major trend.
Since the Broadening Top must have five turns, or reversal in minor or intermedi-
ate trend, and never show a sixth turn, the first reversal of trend will be in the oppo-
site direction from the previous major trend, while the fifth and last turn will also
point the price trend in the opposite direction from the preceding major movement
and set it on its new course opposite that previous direction. Thus the first turn in a
Broadening Top must be a down-turn.
However, all this theoretical description may sound a bit involved to the unfa-
miliar student. We have previously allowed that the Broadening Formation is the
most difficult of all of our major reversal chart pictures and before we go further in
our discussion it may clarify our study to examine some examples in black and
white.
Chart Example of the Broadening Top
Let us look first, then, at Fig. IV.14, the chart of Air Reduction from the late Summer
of 1929 through the memorable panic of that Autumn. The stock was no laggard in
the general action which attended the last, final, spectacular uprush during the Sum-
mer of 1929. From a low point around 95 in April, Air Reduction was in an almost
constant and rapid upward movement, gaining nearly 130 points and much more
than doubling in value in less than six months.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
The first sign of final selling resistance, which was to end the longest and greatest
bull market in history, came at Point C, where we had our first reversal of the previ-
ous major trend, the downward turn which we have just noted we must have for a
Broadening Top. But buying again turned the technical balance temporarily, after a
moderate reaction, and at Point D we had our second reversal. This second turn was
not confirmed as a useful part of our formation, however, until the ensuing upward
movement broke through the previous resistance at Point C, and went higher than
that point, for we have learned that each successive reversal or turning swing must
go farther than the last swing.
But almost immediately after the reverse swing at Point D had been confirmed as
such by the movement going slightly higher than at Point C, we got our third rever-
sal. This third turn at Point E, however, was not confirmed as a useful part of our for-
mation until the new down-swing went still further down than the previous reverse
swing at Point D. And just after the new down-swing, following Point E, had been
thus confirmed our fourth reversal came at Point F-1.
This fourth reversal at Point F-1 was not confirmed as such until, once more, the
new swing, this time upward, exceeded the previous up-swing at Point E. and,
finally, after that fourth reversal at Point F-1 had been confirmed, we got our fifth,
and last, reversal at Point G.
Let the reader note carefully, however, that while the fifth and last turn was made
at Point G, it was not confirmed, did not become official, so to speak, for our pur-
poses, until the ensuing reaction had gone down through and below the previous
low point at Point F-1. The moment that the decline, which started with the fifth
intermediate reversal at Point G, broke below 186, the level at which the fourth turn
was made at Point F-1, our Broadening Top was technically completed.
Completion of the Pattern
Instantly, the forecast was for a large and rapid decline to follow. It might have
ensued immediately; the price of Air Reduction might have continued straight on
down from the day it formed Point H, below Point F-1. Actually, however, there was
a moderate recovery from Point H, and such a partial recovery is generally to be
expected following the completion of a broadening pattern. In the majority of cases,
after the fifth reversal has carried prices below the fourth turning point, there is an
attempt to rally and resume the previous major trend, but this rally seldom gets
beyond the half-way level between the last top and last bottom of the pattern.
With this good example before us we may now see more clearly the resemblance
of the Broadening Top to a Symmetrical Triangle inverted or turned about with its
apex to the left and its base line to the right. We may also note how each successive
reversal must go further than the preceding one before it is confirmed as a useful
– 135–

portion of our picture, and we may easily see, too, how the formation gets its name
of the Broadening Top.
We may recall once more, with this example before us, our previous statement
that since the Broadening Formation must be a reversal to deserve that name, and
since it must also have in it five minor reversal turns, it follows that the first of these
five turns must be a reversal in itself – that is, the first turn must reverse the previ-
ous major trend. So the first turn in the beginning of the Broadening Top must be a
down-turn, while the first turn in a Broadening Bottom would be an up-turn. Like-
wise the last turn will also be in that same direction.
Major Importance of the Broadening Pattern
In the example just studied, in Air Reduction, the Broadening Top ended the longest
and most spectacular bull market in the history of this stock; in only about two
weeks after the Broadening Top had been formed the tremendous declines of the
succeeding panic market had carried the price back down under 80. The broadening
formation is not as infallible as we might wish but, when it does work, it works hard
and profitably.
Some Important Technicallties
In the light of this example we have, it is hoped, cleared up a few of our previously
obscure statements at the beginning of the chapter. Suppose for example, that Air
Reduction, in Fig. IV.14 had continued the recovery which materialized from Point
H to Point J. Suppose that recovery had gone up until it went through the previous
high point, at Point G. Instantly such action would confirm a sixth minor or inter-
mediate reversal, started at Point H. Our Broadening Top is allowed only five such
full reversals and even if the movement had reversed a seventh time, our picture
would already have been technically spoiled. The probability is that our previous
broadening formation would then have turned into a plain Inverted Triangle, with
the same forecast for major reversal, but in any case, confirmation of a sixth inter-
mediate reversal would immediately have destroyed the formation as a Broadening
Top.
One more point may here be touched upon which seems difficult for beginning
students completely to grasp. That is the necessity for each successive intermediate
reversal in the broadening formation to exceed the previous high or low point of the
preceding reverse swing, before the intermediate reversal under observation is def-
initely confirmed.
Between Point F-1 and G, which were properly counted as real turns, we have
Point F-2 which exceeded the previous high point at turn E. But the next downswing

ended at F-3, well short of the previous low point at F-1, and immediately gave way
to another upward movement to Point G. Neither Points F-2 or F-3 could properly
be counted as confirmed turns in our needed five reversals, because the movement
following Point F-2 had not gone down far enough to confirm it as a real turn, below
the previous turn at Point F-1.
And incidentally, if the recovery from Point H to J had continued on back up to
around 215, or even just slightly below Point G, and then turned back down, our
Broadening Top picture would not have been disturbed. The sixth turn, at Point H,
which would have spoiled the entire formation, would not have been confirmed as
such unless and until the new recovery actually exceeded Point G, the highest point
of the fifth confirmed turn, which, of course, it did not do.
Ending Bull Markets
As has previously been noted, the Broadening Top is rare and is not infallible but,
when it does work, it is exceedingly important, and generally marks a critical turn
from a ‘‘bull’’ to a ‘‘bear’’ market. This is comforting to the technical student because
it means that there is still an ample swing for profit on the downside even after he
has waited for some time to be sure that the Broadening Top was a bona-fide rever-
sal pattern.
Figure IV.15 shows the Broadening Top which preceded the long decline in US
Steel from the vicinity of 60 to 37 in the Spring of 1934. It will help the student to rec-
ognize the Broadening Top when, as and if it shows up in his charts, if we take the
time to analyze the pattern in ‘‘Big Steel’’ as carefully as we did that in Air Reduction.
The first reversal in trend appears at point 1, when a three-day reaction carried the
stock from 573/8back to 551/8. The second reversal here (at 2) sent the price up again
in two days to 583/8(at 3A). Here we had what promised to be our third reversal but
note that the reaction from 3A carried only back down to 555/8(at 3B) before prices
turned up again. The reversal at 3A was, therefore, not ‘‘confirmed’’ and could not
be counted as the third reversal in our Broadening Top picture. The upward move-
ment continued to 583/8 (at 3C) before another reversal appeared. Now we have to
disregard the turns at both 3A and 3B and look upon 3C as our third reversal if it
should be confirmed by prices falling below the level of the second reversal at 2. The
reaction from 3C did carry down to 541/2and 3C was thereby established as the third
reversal in what might become a Broadening Top.
The fourth turn (at 4) had to be similarly confirmed by a movement to a level
higher than 3C before we could count it as the fourth of the five reversals of a Broad-
ening Top. This confirmation came in short order for the price of ‘‘Steel’’ worked up
quickly to 597/8on February 19 (point 5). The movement of prices on that day sug-
gests a one-day reversal. A week later the price had dropped to 541/8, lower than the

STUDY IV
level of the fourth reversal; the fifth reversal (at 5) had been confirmed and the
Broadening Top pattern was complete. Two brief rallies followed, which we have
noted as being quite characteristic of this reversal formation, but they ‘‘got
nowhere’’. Nothing short of a recovery to 60 or better would have spoiled our Broad-
ening Top. The ensuing movement needs no comment.
Rally Following Completion of Broadening Top
We have referred in the paragraph above, as well as on page 136, to the partial recov-
ery which usually follows the completion of a Broadening Top pattern. This rally, we
have noted, frequently carries prices about half way back to the level of the last top
or fifth reversal point of the pattern. In the Air Reduction top (see Fig. IV.14) the rally
from H to J retraced almost exactly half the decline from G to H. In the US Steel top
(Fig. IV.15) the Broadening Top formation was completed on March 1 when the price
touched 53 after having attained 597/8at the fifth reversal point. The rally on March
2 carried to 563/4, again half the extent of the preceding decline.
Naturally, we cannot expect such a close approximation of the half-way level on
every rally after a Broadening Top has formed nor, for that matter, can we expect a
rally of any extent always to follow promptly after the decline from the fifth rever-
sal point has carried prices below the fourth reversal. In most cases a rally will
develop shortly after the level of the fourth reversal has been ‘‘broken’’, and in most
cases this rally will carry prices about half way back, but the exceptions are frequent
enough to suggest the practical danger of counting
on it, and to advise the immediate sale of any ‘‘long’’

a rally and to sell when prices have recovered about
40% of the preceding decline which completed the
Broadening Top. Since these rallies are usually very short-lived, it is also good pol-
icy to place an order with one’s broker to sell short at the specified price – the level
to which the hoped-for rally might be expected to carry – as soon as the require-
ments for a Broadening Top formation have been carried out and before the rally has
actually started.
Distinction Between ‘‘Long’’ and ‘‘Short’’ Trading
This distinction in policy between disposing of ‘‘long’’ stock and selling ‘‘short’’
when a top reversal pattern appears on the charts, is based upon all important con-

siderations of safety. Needless to say, it is better to miss a dozen opportunities to
trade through following the rules of caution, than to suffer an actual loss by holding
out for a rally which may never come. Technical patterns are not infallible, a fact we
must keep ever in mind. The Broadening Top is an important and remarkably reli-
able reversal formation yet it may fail. The trader who sells his long stock as soon as
a Broadening Top signals a reversal of the previous up-trend, loses only a part of his
hoped-for profit if the reversal does not eventuate. On the other hand, the trader
who waits for a rally before selling short is just that much better off in case the trend
should go against him.
Broadening Bottoms Extremely Rare
The Broadening Bottom has appeared so rarely in the charts that any discussion of
it may be considered as almost entirely theoretical. It is, of course, simply the same
chart picture as the Broadening Top but coming at the end of a long down trend and
signaling the reversal into an extensive upward movement. The first of its five turns
must, naturally, be an upward one, reversing the previous major decline.
Since a broadening formation by its very nature
can be built up only by a fairly active market such as
It is better to miss a does not ordinarily exist at the end of a ‘‘bear’’ trend,
dozen opportunities to we can understand why true Broadening Bottoms so
trade than to suffer an seldom appear. The few bottom patterns which have
actual loss. conformed to the analytical requirements of a
Broadening Bottom, have also presented as a rule
other and more obvious patterns of bottom reversal.
The student may, therefore, safely forget the Broadening Bottom – at least, he need
waste no time trying to find it.
Broadening Formations Which Fail
We have stated that the Broadening Top is not infallible; also that a formation which
apparently starts out to be a Broadening Top may fail of ultimate completion. Such
uncompleted and violated Broadening Tops seem, nevertheless, to have a practical
significance for the technical student. For the very attempt of a stock to make a
Broadening Top seems to be a reliable warning that an important reversal is soon to
be expected. There were, for example, many stocks which showed in their charts
what promised at first to be typical Broadening Tops in the Spring of 1929. These for-
mations failed of completion and prices moved up out of them in the final drive of
the 1929 market, but they gave technical students cause to anticipate an impending
break and to be prepared for genuine reversal patterns.

IMPORTANT REVERSAL FORMATIONS, CTD.
In the same way, many stocks tried but failed to make Broadening Bottoms in Jan-
uary and February of 1932, just a few months before the actual bottom of the long
‘‘bear’’ market was reached.
Possible Explanation for the Broadening Top
It may serve no very useful purpose to attempt to deduce the market factors which
produce a Broadening Top in the chart of a stock. The value of the formation is suf-
ficiently demonstrated even if a satisfactory explanation is difficult to find. How-
ever, a study of the history of the stock market at those times when Broadening Tops
have appeared, suggests an explanation which seems logical and is very likely cor-
rect. The Broadening Top forms apparently in very active and excited markets after
professional traders have already distributed their important holdings and have
stepped aside. Heavy public participation, however, keeps the market active; prices,
out of professional control, fluctuate in ever widening swings until it becomes evi-
dent that there is no real support or basis for further advance; no buyers appear for
the shares the public now wishes to sell and the market collapses. Such conditions
develop only at or near the end of fast ‘‘bull’’ markets that have run completely out
of bounds.
As for the rule of five reversals, there is no conceivable logical basis for it, yet expe-
rience and a critical examination of many hundreds of stock charts indicate that a
fifth reversal, in other types of congestion as well as in the Broadening Top, more
often than not terminates a reversal pattern and signals the final exhaustion of tech-
nical strength.
A Brief Review
We have examined and studied in this section of our Course three types of technical
patterns which are important as indicating a reversal in price trend of major pro-
portions.
The Multiple Formations, of which the commonest manifestations are the Double
Top and Double Bottom, are reliable when they conform quite strictly to certain
specifications. The tops (or bottoms) must be made with a fair interval of time and a
fair price movement between them, and the ‘‘valley’’ between the tops must be bro-
ken before the formation is complete.
The Complex Formations, closely related to the simple Head and Shoulders, are
among the most reliable of all reversal forecasters, and would qualify for top place
among reversal patterns if they appeared more frequently.
The Broadening Top is an even rarer formation, requiring careful analysis, and is
not as dependable as the Head and Shoulders and the Complex patterns. But it is

does form at a reversal, and it is this indication which warrants our including it

MINOR REVERSAL FORMATIONS
Summary of the Major Reversal Patterns
In the three preceding studies we have analyzed seven types of technical formations
which occur at reversals in stock price trends and have discussed their usefulness in
forecasting. Of these seven, five are of major importance because of their frequent
appearance, or great reliability, or both. These are:
1. The Head and Shoulders
2. The Common or Rounding Turn
3. The Triangle
a. Symmetrical
b. Right-Angle, Ascending and Descending
4. The Multiple Tops and Bottoms
5. The Complex Patterns
The other two formations – the Wedge and the Broadening Tops – were studied
with the above not because of their major importance but rather because of their pic-
torial relation to the major types.
Reversal Patterns of Less Frequent Appearance
In this study we shall take up four more technical formations which may appear at
reversals in price trend, and which are an essential part of the technical trader’s ‘‘kit
of tools’’ although an opportunity to use them may not come very often. Two of
these – the Inverted Triangle and the Diamond – are somewhat related to reversal
patterns previously examined. The other two – the Rectangle, with its variations,
and the Island – are quite new and distinct.
The Inverted Triangle
We have referred to the Inverted Triangle (in our study of the Broadening Top) as a
pattern of price congestion resembling a normal Triangle turned about so that it
forms its apex first, and its wide end or base at the completion of the picture. The
Inverted Triangle, in other words, is formed by a price action exactly opposite to that
which forms a normal Triangle. In the Inverted pattern prices at first fluctuate within
a narrow range but, as time goes on; the fluctuations tend to broaden; the lines
which bound the price track diverge farther and farther apart.
We have in the Inverted Triangles the same two main divisions which we found
in the normal Triangles – the Symmetrical and the Right-angle forms. And we find
Right-angle Inverted Triangles both with ascending and descending hypotenuses.

==================================================

STUDY V
Also, the Inverted Triangles, like the normal Triangles, may signal either a reversal
or a continuation of the previous price trend. There, however, the analogy stops and,
before proceeding to a detailed study of examples, we should give some considera-
tion to general respects in which they differ from the normal Triangles and other
more normal patterns of price congestion.
Differences Between Inverted and Normal Triangles
Among these points of difference, the Inverted Triangle is found much less often
than the normal pattern – perhaps in the ratio of only one Inverted to 30 or 40 nor-
mal Triangles. The Inverted picture is typically
looser and less regular, although occasionally a

a rule than in the case of the normal Triangles. In
fact, unless other helpful technical patterns appear,
many Inverted Triangles offer the technical trader no good opportunity to take a
profitable position in a stock.
However, it is only fair in this study which deals primarily with the formation as
a reversal, to state that the proportion of reversals to continuations is considerably
greater with the Inverted Triangles than is the case with the normal patterns.
Another important difference appears in the volume chart. The volume action
which accompanies the building of a normal Triangle is already familiar to us;
almost invariably we have the base or wide end of the normal Triangle made on rel-
atively high volume, and this is followed by a progressive shrinking of activity as
the price range converges toward an apex, getting less and less until finally the
break-out occurs and volume again picks up with it. In the Inverted Triangles, how-
ever, the volume picture is quite different. The beginning or narrow end of the pat-
tern is frequently made on good volume. Thereafter, activity drops off at first to a
lower level but does not continue to shrink; on the contrary, it is apt to be quite irreg-
ular and, more often than not, tends to increase somewhat on the average as the pat-
tern broadens. A little thought would, of course, show us that higher volume must
accompany wider price fluctuations. This volume action in Inverted Triangle pat-
terns adds to the difficulties in trading on them since it often makes the break-out
difficult to identify with confidence.

STUDY V
Symmetrical Triangle which formed the 1929 top in this stock. The resemblance to a
Broadening Top will be seen at once; in our previous study we stated that the Broad-
ening Top might be considered a special form, or at least closely related to, the
Inverted Symmetrical Triangle. The Broadening Top, however, need not be a compact
pattern of price congestion, and its tops and bottoms need not fall along quite defi-
nite boundary lines as they do in the Inverted Triangles. On the other hand, the ‘‘rule
of five’’ need not be applied to the Inverted Triangle, although it is carried out in the
example before us. Inverted Symmetrical Triangles may also be built up of seven or,
rarely, nine reversals. (And when they become continuation instead of reversal for-
mations, they may have four, six or any larger evennumber of minor reversals within
them. Inverted Triangles as continuations will be taken up in Study VI.)
In our present example of the Inverted Triangle, the price pattern requires no
detailed study, but it will be interesting to analyze the volume action. Note that the
four tops, on September 19 and 26, October 2 and 11, were made on relatively high
volume, with activity falling off each time prices declined. Incidentally, the last two
tops were good one-day reversals. The first change in the volume pattern appears
on Saturday, October 19, when conspicuously high activity accompanied the mak-
ing of a bottom; this, in itself, was definite warning of technical weakness. The lower
boundary line was broken on October 23. Noting the drastic extent of the break-out
of formation on that day, the closing of prices at the bottom of the day’s range, and
the increasing volume, the technical student needed no further confirmation of an
important reversal of trend.
It must be admitted that this chart of General American Transportation presents
an almost ideal Inverted Triangle pattern, extremely rare and, unfortunately, not
typical of the formations of this classification which the chartist is likely to encounter
at the more frequent intermediate reversals.
A More Typical and Less Profitable Example
The chart of Sharon Steel Hoop (Fig. V.2) shows an Inverted Symmetrical Triangle
which signaled the reversal at the April tops of 1936. The reader will see in this a
valid pattern of reversal which, nevertheless, did not give a dependable signal upon
which to take profitable market action. The appearance on our charts of a congestion
which takes on, as it forms, the appearance of an Inverted Triangle, is not in itself a
reliable indication of a reversal, but there are frequently other factors, perhaps other
charts forming true reversal patterns at the same time, which do give help. The
trader who is ‘‘long’’ of the stock may well take his profit and stay out of the stock
until a definite signal of the next trend shows up. The trader who does not already
hold the stock had better not try to trade in it; he can find plenty of other opportu-
nities more clearly forecast and more profitable.

STUDY V
Inverted Right-angle Triangles
Inverted Triangles with one boundary line extended horizontally and the other (the
hypotenuse) slanting strongly either up or down from the origin or theoretical apex
of the formation, are roughly comparable pictorially with the normal Ascending and
Descending Right-angle Triangles previously examined in Study III (refer to pages
88–94).
However, the direction of the hypotenuse in the Inverted Triangle does not give
us a dependable indication of the future course of prices as it does definitely in the
normal Triangle. This failure of the hypotenuse to forecast is conspicuous in both
reversal and continuation patterns and should be kept constantly in mind by the
technical trader in his practical use of the Inverted formations.
The Inverted Triangle with Descending Hypotenuse
In some Inverted Triangles a horizontal leg forms the top boundary line, and the
hypotenuse slants downward from the origin of the formation and forms the bottom
boundary line of the price area. A conspicuously clear and strong example appeared
at the 1929 top in American Can (Fig. V.3). The volume action during the formation
of this reversal pattern is fairly typical of the Inverted Triangles. The sharp down-
ward slant of the hypotenuse certainly suggested technical weakness, yet as is so
often the case in Inverted Triangles, there was no definite and final confirmation of
a reversal in the major trend until the extreme top price had already been left far
behind. The first breakout occurred with high volume on October 24, but the move-
ment reversed itself on that day and the closing price was back within the pattern
and practically at the top of the day’s price range. The next two days’ range fell
within the pattern. It was entirely possible at this stage, from all we could tell by the
chart, to get another rally back to the 160–162 level which would be a normal recov-
ery. Not until October 28 did prices leave the pattern behind definitely, and con-
spicuous volume pressure did not show up until the following day, when American
Can had already fallen from its top of 183 to 132.
Difficulty of Trading on Inverted Triangles
In analyzing the Inverted Triangle top in American Can we have again stressed the
difficulty of taking profitable market action after these patterns are decisively com-
pleted. Our advice to the beginner must be to leave these inverted patterns alone
unless he happens already to own the stock, and to take new positions only on for-
mations of clearer implications. Of course, the trader who was ‘‘long’’ of American

STUDY V
Can should have suspected that the trend had turned down when the rally on Octo-
ber 11 reversed without exceeding the previous tops; he was warranted then in tak-
ing his profit; he might even have arrived at this conclusion on September 20. But
taking a long profit in a doubtful situation and selling short are two very different
matters. A well-financed trader of long experience might have sold the stock short
on October 12 but even then he should have placed a stop-loss order at, say, 187, and
been ready to reverse his position if his stop was caught by a subsequent rally.
It is interesting to note, although it has no special significance, that there are nine
minor or short intermediate reversals plainly to be seen in the formation of the
Inverted Triangle top in American Can.
The Inverted Triangle with Rising Hypotenuse
A good example of an Inverted Triangle with a practically horizontal bottom bound-
ary and an ascending hypotenuse is shown in the chart of General Foods in Fig. V.4.
The pattern is long and rather loose but the diverging boundary lines are well
defined and the triangular construction is clear.
The student will presumably have already observed that this is an example of the
Inverted Triangle in which the break-out proceeds in a direction opposite to the
direction of the hypotenuse (as it forms as time progresses) and, consequently, in the
direction opposite to what we should have expected in the case of a normal Triangle
with a rising hypotenuse. However, we have noted that the slant of the hypotenuse
is not to be taken as a guide in Inverted Triangles.
There was a premature break-out, with volume, on April 23 which we have
learned to recognize (Study III, page 91) as a one-day out-of-line movement. A deci-
sive break, made on volume and closing a full point out of pattern, came on April
27. The rally in May carried prices back up to the level of the bottom of the pattern
but stopped there. Note that activity dwindled away as this rally was made – the
best of evidence, as we shall later see, that the rally was contrary to the basic trend.
Explanation for Inverted Triangles
The Inverted Triangle is difficult to explain. Although the ascending and descend-
ing hypotenuse types suggest (by their horizontal sides) support and resistance,
respectively, or at least well defined demand or supply levels, yet the picture as a
whole is one of a market which reflects wide differences of opinion without leader-
ship, with the final decision as to future price trend awaiting some resumption of
control or some decisive news. This explanation for the formation of Inverted Tri-
angle patterns, if it be true, serves also to explain the difficulty of forecasting from
them.

STUDY V
The suggestion of professional support at the level of the horizontal side of an
Inverted Triangle with rising hypotenuse, or of professional selling at the level of the
top boundary of an Inverted Triangle with descending hypotenuse, is seemingly
corroborated by the fact that any break-out through these horizontal boundaries is
nearly always emphatic and reliable. We have stressed the difficulty of trading prof-
itably on Inverted Triangles, but we should point out that a decisive break through
a horizontal side, representing as the case may be a support or a resistance level, is
a more important signal for the technical trader and does frequently permit us to
take a very profitable position.
The fact that Inverted Triangles are formed as a rule with fairly high and irregu-
lar volume action accounts undoubtedly for their appearing more often at tops than
at bottoms.
The Diamond Formation
Our next reversal pattern gets its name from its quite evident pictorial resemblance
to the conventional four-sided design which is commonly called a ‘‘diamond’’. This
pattern might be considered a variant of the Head and Shoulders. It may be more
accurately described, however, as a formation built up of two Triangles base to base
with their apexes pointing in opposite directions – an Inverted Symmetrical Trian-
gle merging into a normal Symmetrical Triangle. It is rarely found in perfectly sym-
metrical and clearly defined form; a certain amount of latitude must be taken and is
permissible in drawing its boundaries. However, when it does appear, it is a reliable
formation and one which permits the trader to take a profitable position. It is found
more often at tops than at bottoms.
Examples of Diamond Reversals
The chart of Standard Oil of New Jersey in the first half of 1930 (Fig. V.5), contains a
very good illustration of a Diamond Top. From 70 in December, 1929 the price of this
stock had fallen to 58 in February, 1930. A rapid
recovery swept it back up again to 80 before impor-

recall the public optimism that prevailed, leading
many to predict that stocks were headed back for
their 1929 tops. Several days of heavy volume in the 82–84 zone, however,
exhausted the ‘‘good demand’’, and the price dropped 13 points in four days. The
next rally carried only to 81 – but we need not follow the ensuing movements in

detail; the Diamond picture soon became quite apparent and, no matter how loosely
we drew its boundary lines, an obvious break-out occurred on May 7 with decisive
pick-up in volume. (Remember to double a Saturday’s volume in interpreting your
charts). From the break-out in the neighborhood of 78 the stock dropped rapidly to
61, and continued on down in the long bear market.
The reader will note the resemblance of the 1930 Diamond Top in Standard Oil of
NJ to a complex Head and Shoulders with a downward sloping neck-base line. The
Head and Shoulders formations with down slanting neck-base lines ordinarily pre-
sent poor opportunities to take profitable trading positions, but when they permit of
the Diamond construction also, a good break-out signal is given at a much higher
and more profitable level.
At the 1936 April Tops
Another example of the Diamond, in which the resemblance to a Head and Shoul-
ders was not so apparent while the pattern was forming, appears in Fig. V.6, the 1936
chart, of Virginia-Carolina Chemical 6% Preferred stock. The break-out on April 13
was confirmed by a good pick-up in volume and by the fact that it closed well out
of pattern, at the bottom of the day’s price range.
Diamond Bottom Reversals
The Diamond appears at bottoms as well as tops, and is equally reliable as a rever-
sal in either position.
The chart of Sears Roebuck Fig. V.7, shows the Head and Shoulders which formed
at the bottom reversal in this stock early in 1935. But this pattern, although a good
and valid Head and Shoulders, was confused by the extent of the sharp rally on Feb-
ruary 18, and it is doubtful on that account if many chartists would have been look-
ing for the Head and Shoulders development. The Diamond pattern is, however,
quite obvious, and the break-out on April 5 was decisive in every respect and gave
ample play for substantial profit.
We need not take the time to seek an explanation for Diamond formations since it
is plainly evident that they are produced by the same sequence of technical factors
which produce Head and Shoulders Reversals.
The Rectangle as a Reversal
We come now in our study of patterns which form at reversals of price trends, to a
formation that bears no pictorial resemblance to any we have yet studied. We shall
call this the Rectangle because it is a pattern of price fluctuations between two fairly

MINOR REVERSAL FORMATIONS
definite horizontal lines and thus has the appearance of the geometrical rectangle. It
may be long, extending over a considerable period of time, and thin, built up of fluc-
tuations within a narrow price range – or it may be quickly formed of comparatively
wide fluctuations, approaching a square in proportions. Generally speaking, the
volume action during the formation of a Rectangle is the same as the volume in the
formation of a Triangle. The first movement of prices into the pattern is usually
made on good volume; thereafter, activity diminishes, frequently becoming almost
nil as the formation nears its completion; finally a break-out occurs with a notable
increase in volume.
Interpretation Like That of Triangle
Like the Triangle, the Rectangle may signal either a reversal or a continuation of the
previous price trend. Like the Triangle, it is much more often a continuation or inter-
mediate formation than a reversal. And, again like the Triangle, the direction of the
ensuing price trend is determined by the direction of the break-out which must con-
form to the general specifications, as to closing well out of pattern with volume con-
firmation, which we have required of break-outs from other formations previously
studied.
As a reversal, the Rectangle may occur either at a top or bottom. It is found rather
more often at bottoms than at tops, this being particularly true of the long extended,
narrow type of patterns. Its forecasting value is of even greater reliability than that
of the Triangle and it would rank in importance with the Triangle if it were only
formed more frequently.
Rectangular Bottom Reversals
A very interesting formation which made the 1932 bottom in Johns Manville is
shown in Fig. V.8. This pattern is of the relatively long and narrow type. Note the
decline through March and early April to the 10
level, followed by four months of fluctuations

lies, and another at 143/8 bounding the two sharp
thrusts on April 27 and June 15. Since practically all
of the price action takes place below the 131/2level we are warranted in considering
the lower of the two top lines as the pattern’s true boundary. Note also the gradual
decline in activity from an average level of 4,000 or 5,000 shares daily during the
middle of April at the beginning of the formation, to only 1,000 or so shares daily in

early July when the bottom boundary was last touched. And, finally, note the pick-
up in volume as the stock at last turned up, reaching 20,000 shares on the day a deci-
sive break-out occurred with prices closing out of the pattern.
The failure of prices to close at the top of the price range on the breakout day sug-
gested some further consolidation before a rapid mark up, and the brief reaction on
August 2 to the level of the top boundary of the Rectangle was a normal expectation
with no negative implications.
A closer inspection of Fig. V.8 shows a small Rectangle bottom formed in the first
two weeks of July within the bounds of the large Rectangle we have been studying.
It is interesting to observe the increased volume, as
compared with the preceding days, that signaled the

gestion. The break through the top or resistance
boundary of the large pattern, however, could be
expected to lead to an important price movement in view of the four months’ ‘‘foun-
dation’’ it had laid.
Importance of the Rectangle
In our introductory remarks on the Rectangle we mentioned its great dependability.
This holds even though the formation is built on a very small volume of transac-
tions. A conspicuous and typical example occurred at the bottom in Mack Trucks in
May-June, 1936, pictured in Fig. V.9. Dropping precipitately from a price of 37
reached in early April, selling pressure was quickly exhausted and after hitting the
extreme low point of 28 on April 30, the stock fluctuated for nearly six weeks in a
seemingly aimless fashion on very light volume between the approximate price lev-
els of 281/2 and 301/2. The pattern appeared hardly compact enough to carry much
significance yet once prices broke out decisively with a notable pick-up in volume
as they did on June 8, a substantial movement in the new up-trend followed. The
technical trader may well watch carefully any well defined rectangular trading areas
that form on his charts.
(The downward slanting formation in the Mack Trucks chart between June 15 and
July 9, resembling a Wedge, is a type of continuation pattern known as the Pennant
which will be analyzed in Study VI.)

often at bottoms than at tops. Rectangular Tops do appear occasionally, however,
and have the same forecasting value.
A good example appears in the 1930 chart of Auburn, shown in Fig. V.10. This
stock had rallied from an intermediate bottom at 176 in January of this year to a top
at 264 on April 1. Thereafter, it fluctuated for nearly four weeks, with volume gen-
erally declining, in a well defined rectangular area which was broken on the down
side on April 24 with a decisive pick-up in activity. The extent and rapidity of the
decline which ensued could hardly have been foreseen from the size and range of
this Rectangle alone, but we know that Auburn is a stock that has been character-
ized by wide and frequently startling swings.
Break-out of Dormancy
Our next subject for analysis is a formation which we may consider as an extremely
long extended and extremely narrow Rectangular Bottom, or as a distinct pattern
deserving to be separately classified – or even as no pattern at all in the usual sense
of the word. We have chosen to take it up here, as an extreme variant of the Rectan-
gle, since it follows the same general rules, and since every conceivable intergrada-
tion between it and the broader normal Rectangle bottom formations is to be found
in the charts.
When a stock has declined in a long bear trend to the point where all pressure of
liquidation has been exhausted, there frequently ensues a considerable period of time
during which no one cares to buy the stock at any price and the holders prefer to keep
it rather than sacrifice it at such low levels. Until such time as the prospect of better
earnings or a pick-up in the industry generally attracts the attention of shrewd oper-
ators looking for bargain situations, the stock remains practically dormant. Transac-
tions are few and far between and take place at a more or less constant level.
Suddenly, however, there will come a day of real activity in the stock and both the
price and volume lines fairly jump up on the chart. If this sharp rally continues for
several days, getting attention in the press, and if, in the meantime, good news
regarding the industry comes out, the public is attracted into the stock and the mark-
up continues into a substantial upward movement. On the other hand, the sharp
break may be met immediately by offerings from owners of shares who were not will-
ing to sell at the bottom but are now tired out and willing to let go on any reasonable
recovery. Depending on the quantity of such offerings the interests engaged in accu-
mulation have to absorb, the movement may be halted for a time, but even so the
stock does not again become dormant as a rule, or drop back to its previous bottom.
Such breaks out of dormancy offer the technical student of the market who is willing
to wait many months if necessary, an opportunity to take a substantial long-term
profit, since almost invariably such breaks signal the beginning of a major bull trend.

MINOR REVERSAL FORMATIONS
A Common Long-Term Bottom Picture
The student who has available charts of low-priced, relatively inactive issues cover-
ing the 1932–1933 period will find any number of Breaks-out of Dormancy. We will
consider briefly two typical examples, one from the 1933 bottom and one which
broke out two years later.
Figure V.11 shows the action of Omnibus Corporation from March to November,
1935. During the first four months of this chart (and for some time before) this stock
was extremely inactive; for days at a time no transactions whatever were registered
and on many other days there were only single lots of one hundred shares traded.
The price during this long period of dormancy ruled at 31/2to 4. We are hardly justi-
fied by the evidence of the chart in calling this a picture of accumulation yet it is evi-
dent that stock was moving slowly and irregularly, but surely, out of weak and into
strong hands. Many small holders must have become discouraged by the stock’s
failure to move with the rest of the market, and any technical trader who was fol-
lowing the chart must certainly have despaired of ever getting any action.
A Quick Change in the Technical Picture
Note, however, how quickly the picture changed on August 8 when transactions ran
up to 5,000 shares and the price closed over a point above the closing on any day for
many months before. Obviously something had happened to change the technical
position of the stock. Demand for it had come into the market and buyers were
obliged to raise their bids rapidly to secure it. The upward movement continued
with few, brief interruptions and reached 25 in less than a year after the period
charted in our illustration – a gain of over 500% from its dormant level.
Omnibus Corporation may seem to offer a rather extreme picture of dormancy,
yet it is nevertheless a typical example of a fairly common bottom action in low-
priced issues that do not have a large public following. In higher priced and more
actively traded stocks such unusually long periods of dormancy seldom appear, but
brief intervals of very low activity do often occur at the end of major bear trends.
Relative Dormancy in an Active Stock
In Fig. V.12 we have an example of a Break-out of Dormancy in Consolidated Oil in
April, 1933. This stock is one which normally shows good volume and has a good
public following, so we should not expect it ever to become so very inactive as
Omnibus Corporation. Relatively speaking, therefore, the picture from the begin-
ning of this chart is one of dormancy, within a long and very narrow rectangular

pattern. The price action which followed is, perhaps, more typical of what may be
expected of such patterns than was the price action in Omnibus Corporation. On
April 7 there was an attempt to push the price up out of the pattern but the close was
back below the level of the top boundary line. For the next ten days prices fluctuated
around the upper level – a sign of basic strength, emphasizing the probability of an
upward move of profitable proportions to come but offering no dependable indica-
tion as to how soon it would come.
A technical trader who chose to take the price movement on the 7th as a bona-fide
break-out and bought the stock on the strength of it, might conceivably have had his
money tied up in it for weeks or even months before a worthwhile move developed.
We know, of course, from our previous discussion of the qualifications for a genuine
break-out signal, that this action was not decisive. Nevertheless, it is interesting to
note this first tentative stepping up of prices in Consolidated Oil.
On April 19, however, a genuine, emphatic break-out occurred, with high volume
and the price closing well out of the pattern at the top of the day’s range. A slight
reaction a few days later brought the price down (on somewhat lower volume, note)
to just above the level of the last minor congestion where it ‘‘rested’’ for a couple of
days and then moved up more steadily on strong volume. The technical trader who
acted upon the break-out signal had before long a very substantial percentage of
profit on his investment.
The step-by-step movement following the break-out of relative dormancy, which
we have seen in the Consolidated Oil chart, is a common phenomenon. Often the
period of time between each of these steps up is long-extended, which is the reason
for our stating that patience is required in trading on this formation in many cases.
Progress is none the less sure and eventual profits are nearly always well worth
waiting for.
The Island Formation
The last in our study, and undoubtedly the rarest of the reversal formations which
have important forecasting value, is the Island. In one respect it certainly takes first
rank among all reversal signals and that one respect is the surprising extent and
rapidity of the price movements which so often develop out of it, considering the
characteristic small size of the formation itself.
In order to define the Island Reversal pattern we shall first have to define another
technical phenomenon known as a ‘‘price gap’’. The general subject of gaps will be
fully discussed later on in Study VII where we shall learn that the gap has several
different manifestations and several different implications depending on its position
in relation to the rest of the chart picture.

MINOR REVERSAL FORMATIONS
A First Look at Gaps
For the purpose of our present subject, however, all we need to know is that a gap is
an open space occurring on our chart where the bottom of one day’s price range
comes at a higher level than the top of the preceding day’s range – or where one
day’s top range fails to reach the bottom level of the preceding day. One good exam-
ple will undoubtedly suffice to make this picture
clear, so look now at our next illustration, the

third day of this week, October 23, the stock’s high-
est price was 1113/4 and on the next day the lowest
price was 1123/4. Between the price range lines of the two days there is an open space,
a gap of a full point. This is a good example of a technical price gap.
The student will find many charts, especially those of inactive issues and stocks of
small floating supply, full of gaps. The charts of other issues which are normally
active, and of which a large number of shares are outstanding, may show gaps very
rarely. Naturally a gap in a stock of the latter class is presumptively of greater sig-
nificance than a gap in a stock which habitually makes them more frequently. Pre-
sumptively, also, the wider the gap the greater its significance, but here again the
past habits of the stock under our observation must be taken into consideration. A
gap of a point in a thin and erratic or a high-priced stock might have little or no
meaning, whereas a gap of half a point might be highly significant in an actively
traded leader or a low-priced issue.
The Island Formation Described
An island is a compact area of price congestion separated by gaps from the preced-
ing and following price movements. If the gaps occur one on the top and the other
on the bottom of the congestion area – if, for example, prices ‘‘gap into’’ the conges-
tion from below and then ‘‘gap out’’ of it in an upward movement – we have a con-
tinuation pattern of no significance which we need consider here. If, on the other
hand, prices gap into the congestion and then gap out again on the same side, with
gaps forming at the same level, we have a pattern of great import, the true Island
Reversal.
In the above description we have spoken of the Island as a compact area of price
congestion but it may be, in fact, and frequently is, completed in a single day, and a
One-day Island is a perfectly valid forecasting pattern.

MINOR REVERSAL FORMATIONS
Gaps Should Form at Same Level
Before we proceed to an analysis of specific examples, we must examine in detail
one other point, viz., the requirement that the two gaps at either end of the island
occur opposite each other, at the same price level. This does not mean that the two
gaps must match exactly in their upper and lower limits but it does mean that at
least some part of each gap must come at the same price level. This requirement is
important and, in the same connection, it is further required that no part of the
Island congestion itself shall extend into, so as to ‘‘close’’ or completely overlap, the
gap that occurred at the beginning of the pattern. If, for example, we have a gap on
our chart from 29 to 30 and the ensuing price movement works down in a few days
to 29 or below, then back up again above 30, and then gaps down from 30 to 29, our
gaps form opposite each other, it is true, but the first gap was ‘‘closed’’ by the price
action before the second gap occurred, so we do not have a true Island. In brief, some
little open price space must extend through the gaps horizontally clear across the
chart between the Island and the price track both preceding and following it.
Probably it is not necessary to add that we should have had a fair movement
before the first gap, and in the direction of the first gap, before we could expect an
Island Reversal of any great import to form.
A Powerful Island Reversal Example
Figure V.13, to which we have already referred, shows the market action of Owens-
Illinois Glass for the last half of 1935 and contains an almost perfect example of an
Island Reversal of very strong construction. This stock had been in an indecisive but
generally downward trend during the Summer of 1935, working down to about 94
in early August, rallying to about 100, dropping again to 95 where the market closed
on September 7 at the bottom of that day’s range. On Monday, September 9, the next
trading day, the price ranged from 93 down to 87, leaving a clear gap of 2 points
between 95 and 93 on the chart. Then, for three weeks the stock fluctuated in the gen-
eral 88–91 zone, never getting up to 93. Between Saturday, September 28 and Mon-
day, September 30, however, another gap occurred, this time in an upward direction,
from the Saturday high of 913/8to the Monday low of 931/2. This left a space clear of
price action across the chart between 93 and 931/2with a compact congestion below
it – a perfect island, calling for immediate action. The forecast of this pattern called
for not only a reversal of the previous trend but also an unusually powerful move-
ment in the new trend. And the movement which actually followed was not much,
if at all, out of proportion to the action we would expect from an Island Reversal of
this size and character.

STUDY V
Before leaving the Owens-Illinois Glass chart we will mention again the gap in the
last week in October only to state that this is a continuation gap – a type which will
be taken up in detail in Study VII.
One-Day Island Forecasts
We had in the example of Island Reversal previously discussed, an island built up of
three weeks of price congestion, separated by wide gaps from the preceding and
ensuing price track. This gave a forecast of a very important movement. An island
of only one day’s duration is equally reliable as an indication of reversal in trend but
does not, as a rule, lead to so extensive a movement.
The chart of Electric Bond and Share for the last half of 1935, Fig. V.14, shows two
good examples of One-Day Island Reversals on August 17 and November 8, respec-
tively, at the tops of intermediate rallies. The gap following the second of these was
‘‘closed’’ or overlapped by the price range on November 14 and again on November
20, but it will be noted that these minor rallies failed to attain the top level of the
Island, and the reversal forecast was eventually carried out. An interesting feature
of this chart is the Double Bottom formation at the 101/2level which again reversed
the trend following the first Island (see Study IV).
The 1936 American Steel Foundries chart (Fig. V.15), shows a One-Day Island on
July 8 that reversed a minor down trend and led to a strong upward movement. The
bottom reversal in this stock in early May was built on an Ascending Triangle (see
Study III).
Other Island Manifestations
The 1936 chart of Atchison (Fig. V.15), shows two other types of action following the
formation of Islands.
On July 7 and 8 an Island formed on the chart following a recession of very small
extent. The implication was for an upward movement which in this case was actu-
ally a resumption of a previous upward trend that had been only briefly interrupted.
On September 8 another Island, this time a one-day formation, appeared at the top
of a two-weeks rally. This was a good reversal signal but some little time elapsed –
five weeks, in fact – before a good downward movement got under way. Neverthe-
less, this Island ‘‘worked’’ and worked very profitably for the technical trader who
did not allow himself to be worried out of his position by the two attempts the stock
made to rally before succumbing to the indicated technical weakness.

MINOR REVERSAL FORMATIONS
Explanation for Island Formation
In our later study of gaps we shall learn that the first gap into an Island is an
‘‘exhaustion’’ gap which signals a final spurt of activity in a trend and which carries
the price into a zone of high resistance. The second gap, out of the Island, is a ‘‘break-
away’’ gap which emphasizes the importance of any break-out into a new trend. The
strong implications of each of these gaps, when they are combined in one formation
as they are in the Island Reversal, account for the rapid and extensive price move-
ment in the new trend which the Island forecasts.
Two Interesting and Spectacular Charts
Figure V.16 shows two charts which further illustrate the important moves that may
develop out of two of the technical formations we have taken up in this Study.
The weekly chart of Bulova Watch shows a Break-out of Dormancy in 1935, plus
a very interesting Symmetrical Triangle developed by the price action during the
dormant period. We have noted before how one technical pattern will often appear
as a part of another, and how both, as a rule in such cases, forecast the same price
action to follow. The very long triangular base in Bulova Watch gave an added clue
to the extent of the ensuing upward move.
The Loew’s chart shows an excellent Island Reversal which signaled the 1929 top
in this stock. Also the reader will see that this Island appeared at the fifth and final
reversal of a large Broadening Top pattern which started to form in late January and
was completed in March, 1929. In April, 1937, it is interesting to note that Loew’s
again made an Island top, although not as clean-cut as the 1929 example, and that
this 1937 Island formed at the third reversal point of a large Broadening Top pattern
which is most easily seen on a weekly chart of that period.
Continuation Formations Next
This Study completes, for the present, our consideration of technical formations
which are indicative of a reversal in price trend, although we shall take up later on
under the subject of trend line action, etc. other reversal signals which the market
may give on occasions. Study VI will take up the subject of formations which indi-
cate a continuation or resumption of the previous price trend.

MAJOR CONTINUATION FORMATIONS
Definition of the Continuation
The reader is no doubt already sufficiently familiar with the difference between a
reversal and a continuation formation to make up his own definition of the latter.
The continuation, or intermediate, formation is simply an intermediate pattern
which interrupts temporarily the previous major trend, and forecasts continuation
of that preceding major trend when the formation has been completed.
The logical explanation for the occurrence of continuation patterns is perhaps not
so easily arrived at as for the reversal pictures. In the latter we observed how it was
quite natural to expect a period of hesitation – a chart formation, a price area – dur-
ing the interval when the previous balance between buying and selling was being
reversed, with consequent slow reversal of the price trend.
Logic of the Intermediate Area
In the case of the intermediate or continuation formation, which is also in most cases
suggestive of an area, there appears this same hesitation, this similar checking of the
previous trend, but for different reasons. The most logical explanation of the con-
tinuation formation goes back to a basic possibility that it might turn out to be a
reversal.
When, with the formation of a continuation pattern, the previous major move-
ment is arrested, it is generally because too much resistance is being met, because the
preceding movement has been too rapid, because ‘‘inside’’ operators have achieved
one phase of their campaign and wish to consolidate that phase, or because they are
undecided whether to continue their campaign or to close it, and are waiting for
some technical advice on the question from the market itself.
So, when an intermediate formation begins to develop, it is possible that the pic-
ture will turn out to be a reversal. It is not long, however, before a technical signal in
the market itself appears and indicates, to insiders as well as to the chart student,
that all is well for continuation of the previous campaign, that the formation is a con-
tinuation rather than a reversal, and that the preceding major movement has been
resumed at the end of the formation.
Inside Operations and Intermediate Chart Patterns
Suppose, for instance, that powerful interests with an accumulated line of 10,000
shares of stock, have marked the price up from 50 to 75. At the latter level selling
resistance begins to stiffen in opposition to further advance. The bull operators
immediately stop their aggressive buying and let the public show its hand for a
– 179–



==================================================
                     PAGE 202                     
==================================================

STUDY VI
while. The advance is checked. The interests have a ‘‘paper’’ profit of 25 points on
10,000 shares and while they are waiting to see how strong the technical position is
when the stock is left comparatively to itself, they decide to play safe and realize
profits on at least a portion of their long line.
Public buying is still good, the resistance which was felt a few days ago dries up,
but the operators propose a further test, a further resting period, for more good news
to accumulate, for the public to hear and talk about the stock, and so they meet fur-
ther public buying demand by gradually handing out perhaps 4,000 shares of their
line and taking that profit. The result is further irregularity in price, and develop-
ment of the continuation formation.
The operators have now established the stock in a narrow price range, but they
have also determined that the stock is still good for a further markup to around 90,
at least. So they begin to buy back some of the stock they sold at the beginning of the
formation. They control the price range by selling near the top of this range and buy-
ing back near its bottom, meanwhile making a very satisfactory profit turnover and
actually strengthening the technical position of the issue.
The public sees that the stock has stopped going up and there is a little public
profit-taking, especially if the operators can engineer a sharp shake-out, or false
move, at the end of the intermediate formation, and just before they begin the sec-
ond phase of mark-up. In this way they buy back, at a small net profit, perhaps 3,000
of the 4,000 shares they sold during the formation. They have taken at least 25 points
profit on 1,000 shares and clinched that, as well as the intermediate trading profits
they made while prices ranged within the pattern.
The Market Writes Its Own Forecast
With a line of 9,000 shares still long, therefore, they are ready to resume their cam-
paign and mark the stock up to the new objective of 90, and the formation which
started when they first felt some slight resistance, and which might have turned out
to be a reversal formation if that resistance had continued, has now developed into
a continuation formation, and the stock continues on up to its higher objective
around 90, where the real reversal area is finally formed.
This is merely one rather simplified illustration but it may serve to suggest that
intermediate formations have logical bases just as
we have seen that reversal formations have. The
important point for the chart student, however, is
The market writes its
that all of these factors which have influenced the
own forecast
decisions of operators, the balance of buying and
selling by the public, the balance of buying and sell-
ing by inside interests, or the refusal by the public to either buy or sell – all are

MAJOR CONTINUATION FORMATIONS
reflected accurately in the formation of this picture, and they are the factors which
go to furnish us with our individual phenomena which differentiate the picture
from a reversal formation and set it apart in a class by itself, as a continuation pat-
tern. And it is these continuation formations, and their minor characteristics, which
we shall now undertake to analyze in this Study of our Course.
Reviewing the Symmetrical Triangle
In Study III, starting with page 74, we studied the various definitions of the Tri-
angle, or coil, and noted the appearance of the Symmetrical Triangle as a reversal.
The continuation Symmetrical Triangle is identical in appearance with the reversal
pattern and that is why the formation is a confusing one. We noted also in Study III
that while the Symmetrical Triangle, in itself, does not tell us whether it will turn out
to be a reversal or a continuation, still it is more often the latter, and that, in any case,
there are usually various clues outside the formation itself.
These include the fundamental aspects for the individual stock and the market as
a whole, the technical indications in other issues and for the entire market, the vol-
ume of trading, and finally, the most important and most reliable factor, the direc-
tion of price movement on the break-away.
There is one other factor which cannot always be depended upon but which is
nevertheless a recognized aid. That is the length and strength of the movement pre-
ceding the formation of the Triangle. If the previous movement has been long, with-
out a nearby halt or intermediate corrections, then the Symmetrical Triangle is more
likely to be a reversal. If the preceding move has been only a short and weak one,
then the chances are better that the formation will turn out to be a continuation of
that previous movement.
Upward Continuation Triangles
Undoubtedly the reader is so familiar by this time with the appearance of the Sym-
metrical Triangle pattern that he will have no difficulty in detecting any number of
examples in his own charts as well as in the Figures in this Course. Frequently a sin-
gle chart will show three or four good Symmetrical Triangles. They may vary in their
size as well as in their angle of convergence into the apex, in almost every imagin-
able degree, but they all have the same basic meaning for the technical student.
Figure VI.1 the chart of Electric Boat, shows three continuation Triangles of the Sym-
metrical type which were plain to see as they developed. The first, forming over two
months time, with an emphatic break-out in the direction of the preceding upward
trend on November 21, gave indication by its size and appearance in general that the
upward movement of prices would continue for some distance. The second, which

MAJOR CONTINUATION FORMATIONS
formed immediately thereafter, served only to confirm the forecast of the first. The
third is to be seen formed by the price action during the latter part of January, 1936.
Noteworthy in the analysis of this Electric Boat chart is the high volume of activ-
ity which accompanied the break-out from each continuation pattern – an indication
of the bona-fide nature of the movement, which we shall take up in a later Study
under the subject of ‘‘false moves’’. Also noteworthy is the reaction of prices, fol-
lowing the break-out from the second and third Triangles, to the approximate level
of these break-outs before proceeding in the upward trend. This reaction to the sup-
port level of the break-out is a normal occurrence which may be expected to follow
the completion of, perhaps, a quarter of all Symmetrical Triangles. Knowledge of
this fact – that such a reaction is normal and has no negative significance – is reas-
suring to the technical trader who has taken a position on the break-out and who
might, otherwise, suspect he had been misled. Also, a reaction of this sort affords a
second opportunity to make an additional purchase (sale, if the trend be down) at a
profitable level. In this connection it should be noted that these reactions do not
always reach the exact level of the break-out; they may carry slightly farther or they
may not carry so far.
Examples in Preceding Illustrations
In order to get a comprehensive mental picture of the various forms which a Sym-
metrical Triangle may take when it occurs as a continuation, we suggest that the
reader examine the following examples which appear in the illustrations in preced-
ing Studies, as follows:
Fig. II.1 – Break-out on August 23.
Fig. II.4 – Break-out on February 6.
Fig. III.3 – Break-out on December 24. This shows an almost but not quite hori-
zontal lower boundary line, suggesting a Descending Triangle, but the
fact that it followed so shortly after an important reversal pattern
made it almost certain that this would be a continuation Triangle.
Fig. III.7 – Break-out on December 7. Note in this case that there were two reac-
tions to the break-out level.
Fig. III.9 – Break-out on June 4 (see discussion of volume action in down-trends
later in this study).
Fig. III.10 –Break-out on October 19 (Saturday).
Fig. III.13 –Break-out during the first week of March, 1931. Note that it is impos-
sible to see the volume on a break-out dayin a weeklychart.

Volume Action in Continuation Triangles
The reader will have, we trust, examined the volume action as well as the price
actions in the examples of continuation Symmetrical Triangles we have cited above.
The volume of transactions tends to shrink during the formation of a continuation
Triangle just as it does in a Triangle signaling reversal, and the decisive break-out of
pattern is almost invariably accompanied by a noticeable pick-up in volume. This
increased volume on the break-out is more accentuated in upward movements than
in down-trends. In the latter cases prices occasionally have moved some little dis-
tance from the theoretical apex before there is a conspicuous increase in activity. The
same price tests as to validity of break-outs should be applied to continuation pat-
terns as to reversal break-outs previously studied.
Continuation Triangles in Down-trend
In the examples cited above of continuation Triangles which appeared in Figures
illustrating previous Studies, a number occurred in down-trends. The Symmetrical
Triangle forms as often as a continuation pattern in a bear market as it does in a bull
market, and is equally important and useful in either trend.
Right-angle Continuation Triangles
In our study of the Triangle as a reversal pattern (Study III) we learned to distinguish
between the ordinary or Symmetrical Triangle and the Right-angle Triangle. In the
latter type one side extends horizontally while the other, the hypotenuse, slants
either up toward the apex making an Ascending Triangle and calling for an upward
movement of prices, or slants down and calls for a downward price movement. In
practice we find many triangular areas which have one side nearly but not quite hor-
izontal and which suggest, therefore, either an Ascending or Descending Triangle.
These border-line cases are best regarded as Symmetrical Triangles; it is safest
always to assume that the break-out may go in either direction. We have seen in the
Goodrich chart (Fig. III.3) an example of a Triangle which suggested the Descending
picture; close inspection, however, shows that the bottom boundary does have a
slight upward slant, and the break-out actually proceeded in an upward direction.
The chart of Holly Sugar (Fig. VI.2) shows the development of an intermediate

pattern in February, 1936, which might be construed as either an Ascending or a
Symmetrical Triangle. In this case the break-out in the upward trend did carry out
the ascending suggestion but the Triangle might, nevertheless, have turned out to be
a reversal as is always possible with Symmetrical Triangles.
True Right-angles Triangles as Continuations
Triangles which show a strictly horizontal top or bottom boundary line – in other
words, true. Ascending or Descending Triangles – in the great majority of cases carry
out their ascending or descending implication. In our study of reversals we have
seen that the appearance of a Descending Triangle in an upward trend forecasts a
reversal into a downward trend, and the development of an Ascending Triangle in
a down-trend forecasts a reversal into a rising market.
It follows naturally that the opposite conditions will produce an opposite forecast.
An Ascending Triangle, for example, developing in an upward trend, forecasts a
continuation of the upward movement when the formation is completed. And a
Descending Triangle, by the same token, implies continuation when it forms in a
down-trend.
The chart of International Nickel for the last half of 1935 (Fig. VI.3), shows a very
good example of a small, compact Ascending Triangle which signaled a rapid con-
tinuation of the preceding up-trend. This stock had been moving up gradually
through the first part of the year and reached a sort of minor buying climax on Sep-
tember 17. It is evident that it met here, at the 311/2level, considerable profit taking
which sent the price off rapidly to around 29. A brief rally regained half the previ-
ous week’s loss and was followed by another dip to the 29 level where good buying
again appeared. So far no pattern of clear significance had developed. A technical
trader who had carried the stock up from lower levels might have been in doubt at
this time as to the advisability of taking his profit; however, his best policy was to
wait for some definite sign of reversal even if it meant a loss of a point or two in his
‘‘paper’’ profits.
The rapid turn up from 29 on October 3 was bullish, and from then on a pattern
began to appear which made a strong continuation of the up-trend more and more
likely. The horizontal top line was very plain to see while, as the volume of trading
gradually declined, the tendency of the bottom boundary to lift became increasingly
evident. The two boundary lines thus formed an Ascending Triangle out of which
we should expect an upward movement. A clear and emphatic break-out occurred
on November 1 when prices moved up out of the pattern on high volume and closed
at the top of the day’s range. Any technical trader keeping this chart had thereby
definite advice to buy ‘‘Nickel’’ and could have bought it the following day around
321/2, while those who were already long of it could congratulate themselves on not

ing taken place. There is no doubt that many tape-watchers and gossip-followers
were shaken out of good positions in ‘‘Nickel’’ at this period because either they did
not have a chart history to guide them, or did not realize that no reversal had been
indicated on the chart.
A Strong Picture in Anaconda
Another excellent example of an Ascending Triangle in an up-trend, with some very
interesting features worthy of detailed study formed in Anaconda Copper at the end
of 1935 and beginning of 1936. This is pictured in Fig. VI.4. On December 10, a wave
of profit-taking started, sending the price off from 30 to 261/4. Thereafter, for nearly
six weeks, Anaconda rallied repeatedly to the 30 level only to meet resistance and
turn back again. Each rally was characterized by increasing volume and each set-
back by declining volume, an encouraging sign (to be considered in detail later in
Study VIII) that the major trend had not changed.
During this period, up to January 17, a good

out of pattern and the volume was insignificant. On
the following two days prices ranged still lower but
the volume was even less. At this point our pattern appeared to be spoiled. How-
ever, the next day, January 22, told a different story; Anaconda moved up over a
point on good volume and closed back above the hypotenuse line. And on the fol-
lowing day, volume rose to 60,000 shares and the price broke the top boundary line
and closed well away; a definite break-out signal had finally been given, and in the
direction which the formation had previously implied. Prices were still reluctant to
move away; minor fluctuations held just above the resistance line for two weeks, but
it will be noted that there were no closings below the critical level. On February 11
another burst of activity accompanied the beginning of a real mark-up.
False Moves Studied Later
In the Anaconda chart which we have just analyzed, the movement of prices Janu-
ary 18 to 22 is what is called a ‘‘false move’’, a not uncommon phenomenon which
we shall take up in detail in a later study. It will suffice at this time to state that a false
move is usually an indecisive movement out of a pattern on lowvolume, whereas a
genuine break-out is a strong movement on good volume. A false movement, such
as we have seen in the Anaconda chart, once it has returned within the pattern, has

no forecasting significance and does not ‘‘spoil’’ the pattern.
A false move differs from an out-of-line move which we discussed in Study III in
that the out-of-line movement occurs on fair volume, in the direction which the for-
mation is already suggesting, whereas a false move runs contrary to the implication
of the formation and is characterized by low volume.
Descending Triangles in Down-trends
Descending Right-angle Triangles appear as frequently in down-trends as do
Ascending Triangles in up-trends, and have the same significance, i.e. a continuation
of the previous trend.
A good example of the Descending Right-angle Triangle as a continuation appears
in the American Can chart for 1931 (Fig. VI.5). The rapid decline in the price of
‘‘Can’’ was halted early in August, and a Descending Triangle formed with its hori-
zontal side at the 88–89 level. This was broken decisively, with increased volume, on
September 14. A subsequent rally carried back up to 88 but failed to penetrate the
breakout level.
Examples in Previous Studies
The reader will find several good examples of Right-angle Triangles as continuation
formations in Figures illustrating the preceding. Studies of this Course. Refer to the
following:
Fig. II.2 – A descending Triangle following the Head and Shoulders Top in
Western Union in 1934. Bottom boundary at the 52–53 level, and
break-out with increased volume on April 30.
Fig. III.11 –An Ascending Triangle in Hudson Motor following immediately after
the Ascending Triangle Bottom in this stock in 1933. Break-out with
high volume on January 15, 1934.
Fig. IV.6 – An Ascending Triangle at the beginning of the Timken Roller Bearing
chart, with break-out February 9.
Inverted Triangles as Continuations
In our discussion of Inverted Triangles as reversals in Study V we noted how hard
it is to interpret this formation, as compared with the normal or standard Triangle.
Generally speaking, the Inverted Triangles of the symmetrical type seem to present
no clue as to what may be their cause. Volume during their formation is usually
irregular and apparently meaningless. Break-outs may occur with or without con-

firming volume. When they break-out with high volume the subsequent move may
be of profitable dimensions, but frequently it is quickly halted and reversed. And the
chances that they will turn out to be reversals rather than continuation formations is
rather greater than is the case with normal patterns.
If it were not for the fact that patterns classifiable only as Inverted Triangles of
symmetrical design do appear on the charts with fair frequency, we should be
tempted to ignore them altogether. As it is, we feel constrained to warn the beginner
not to attempt to trade on them unless other patterns of a more helpful nature
appear on the same chart at the same time.
Examples of Inverted Symmetrical Triangles
The chart of Sears Roebuck for the latter part of 1936, Fig. VI.6, shows an Inverted
Triangle of symmetrical design formed by the price action during August and early
September, best seen if the reader will cover up the chart from September 12 on.
Within the formation up to this point there was no dependable indication of what
might follow. During the three weeks that followed, however, a small, normal Sym-
metrical Triangle formed and broke out decisively on the up side, signaling a con-
tinuation of the preceding upward movement.
The top boundary line of the large Inverted Triangle was not broken, it will be
noted, until October 13, a good ten points above the price level at the origin of the
formation. As is the case in a great many Inverted formations, no profitable action
could have been taken on the break-out indication given by this formation in itself.
Fortunately, trend line action and other more reliable continuation signals would
have kept us ‘‘long’’ in Sears during this period.
Almost a Broadening Top
The chart of Standard Oil of NJ for the first part of 1936, Fig. VI.7 shows another
example of an Inverted Triangle of symmetrical design, with a break-out accompa-
nied by terrific activity on March 13. The reader will see in this pattern a Broaden-
ing Top (Study IV) which was nearly but not quite completed. If the decline from
point 5 on March 4 had gone down below 58, the Broadening Top would have been
completed, signalling an important reversal of trend. As it was, an important rever-
sal did occur very soon thereafter, bearing out the warning (see Study IV, page 138)
that a Broadening Top which fails of completion frequently gives us.
Right-angle Inverted Triangles More Reliable
Inverted Triangles that have one boundary line extended horizontally are somewhat

MAJOR CONTINUATION FORMATIONS
more useful to the technical trader than those of symmetrical design. We have in the
horizontal side of Inverted Triangles of right-angle design a definite picture of sup-
port or resistance as the case may be, a pattern of some apparent logic and, conse-
quently, a pattern that gives dependable breakout signals. The direction pointed by
the hypotenuse in these formations seems to have little or no significance, which
was also the case, as we have noted in Study V, with Inverted Triangle Reversals of
this type. An Inverted Triangle may prove to be a continuation pattern in either an
up or down trend regardless of whether the top or the bottom boundary line is the
horizontal. In either case, a decisive break-out from a narrow pattern generally sig-
nals a worthwhile movement, and from any pattern, wide or narrow, if the break-
out proceeds through the horizontal line.
Examples of Profitable Inverted Types
The 1935 chart of Columbia Gas and Electric (Fig.VI.8) shows a long and rather loose
formation but recognizable, nevertheless, as an Inverted Triangle with a horizontal
bottom and rising hypotenuse. The top boundary was decisively broken on Satur-
day, August 3, and a good upward movement followed.
The chart of Burroughs Adding Machine (Fig. VI.9) shows an Inverted Triangle
with a horizontal top boundary and a downward slanting hypotenuse, which broke
out on the up side on Saturday, October 19, continuing the previous upward trend.
Inverted Triangles of this type – with one horizontal boundary – are equally use-
ful as continuation patterns in a down trend.
The Rectangle as a Continuation
In our analysis of the Rectangle as a reversal formation in Study V, pages 156–61, we
remarked that this pattern appears also as an intermediate or continuation forma-
tion – in fact, more often as a continuation than as a reversal. We commented also on
the high degree of reliance that may be placed on any break-out from a rectangular
area of price congestion. False movements out of Rectangles are very rare indeed.
It is probably safe to say that Rectangle continuation formations occur more often
in the early stages of major or long-term trends than in the later stages. Thus Rec-
tangles appear quite frequently in the first gradual stepping up of prices after a
major bottom has formed; as such they represent well organized accumulation in a
period of comparatively little public excitement. However, whenever they appear,
whether early or late in a major or intermediate market cycle, the direction of their
break-out may be depended upon to indicate the direction of the subsequent move-
ment.
The volume characteristics of the Rectangle were also discussed under its rever-

Examples of Rectangles in an Up-trend
The chart of Transamerica Corporation (Fig. VI.10) shows a Rectangle that presented
a nearly ideal pattern and gave the technical trader a clear forecast of a substantial
continuation of the up-trend in this stock. The first stages of mark-up met resistance
in the second week of August, 1935, either through ill-advised (as it later developed)
profit taking or through well organized profes-
sional operations, at the 8 level. Thereafter, for

noticeable. On October 21, however, the stock
burst its bonds either professional operators
were satisfied with the extent of their accumulations and were now ready for the
mark-up, or some favorable news brought strong buying from other sources into the
picture. So far as we are concerned, the cause does not matter, for the chart told us
all we needed to know when we had posted the price and volume action for Octo-
ber 21. We saw then that the price had moved out of pattern up to 83/8and closed at
the top – a decisive margin of break-out in an eight dollar stock – and the pick-up in
volume was conclusive. The chart said, ‘‘Buy Transamerica’’. In five weeks it
showed better than 60% profit.
Note that the Transamerica chart is constructed on a 1/4 point price scale, which
helps to show up any patterns that may develop in a very low-priced issue.
It is not to be assumed that all Rectangles of continuation will lead to price move-
ments of such immediately profitable consequences as did the example we have just
studied in the Transamerica chart. It is at least equally possible that the first break-
out of a rectangular area will be followed by a reaction back to the level of the top
boundary before a mark-up of any considerable extent occurs. Such a set-back is
almost invariably accompanied by a shrinkage in volume, and then activity again
picks up sharply when the upward movement is resumed.
Rectangles in Chrysler, 1935
Figure VI.11 shows two typical continuation Rectangles which formed during the
upward movement of Chrysler in the last half of 1935. This stock is an active trad-
ing favorite under normal market conditions and is consequently characterized by
high volume. Nevertheless, a general tendency of volume to decline during the

MAJOR CONTINUATION FORMATIONS
formation of the intermediate Rectangles can be seen, and the increase of activity on
the break-out days is conspicuous. Any doubts occasioned by the halting of the up-
trend of prices at 62 and again at 74, were decisively dispelled by the strong charac-
ter of the break-outs on September 4 and October 10 respectively.
Rectangle Continuations in Down-trends
The Rectangle appears as a continuation in downward movements somewhat less
frequently than in upward, but is equally dependable in either trend. The volume
accompanying the initial break out of a downward continuation Rectangle often
shows little or no marked pick-up, but we have noted previously in our considera-
tion of Descending Triangle Tops (in Study III) which have, like the Rectangle, a well
defined horizontal bottom boundary or support level, that volume confirmation is
not required if the price movement is conclusive. In such cases, a conspicuous
increase in activity may not show up until the second or third day after the break.
The technical trader may depend upon it that any breaking down through, and clos-
ing well below, a well-defined support level in a pattern which forms in a down
trend or suggests in itself a downward trend, is important even though the volume
action is inconclusive.
Examples in the 1931 Bear Market
Reference to the long-term average chart (frontispiece) at the beginning of this
Course, shows that one of the important intermediate recoveries in the long decline
from the 1929 tops took place in the first three months of 1931, after which the trend
was again reversed and prices worked on down to new low levels. A number of
stocks developed good Rectangles on their charts in the course of this rapid decline.
Two good examples are shown in Figs. VI.12 and VI.13.
In the chart of Electric Auto-Lite (Fig. VI.12) the drop from the top price of 743/4
was halted at 61, and for three weeks in April, the price fluctuated between 61 and
66. During this period activity was at a relatively low ebb and generally declining
except on one day, April 13, but it is interesting to note that the price range on that
one day did not break out of the pattern so the volume on that day had no forecast-
ing significance. On April 17, however, the Rectangle was decisively broken on the
down side with even greater volume, forecasting a continuance of the bear move-
ment.
The chart of Ingersoll Rand (Fig. VI.13) is of special interest because it shows a
Rectangle formed under unusual circumstances. During August and September in
1931 the price of this stock had fallen rapidly from above 100 in an extremely thin
and inactive market. Volume picked up as the first of October was approached,

STUDY VI
however, and the stock now met support for six weeks around the 48–50 level and
three times ran up to 60 in sharp rallies during which it later appears that insiders
distributed a large amount of the IR stock to the public. The support was with-
drawn, or in any event the support level was broken, on November 18; activity was
high but no higher, generally speaking, than on many of the preceding days. A con-
spicuous increase in volume did not show up until the 21st (remember to double the
Saturday volume) when the price dropped below 40. This chart illustrates the point
regarding volumes not necessarily increasing on breaks through support levels into
down trends which we discussed at the top of this page.
Rectangle Continuations in Other Figures
The reader will find a number of other good rectangular patterns of price congestion
which signaled continuation of the preceding trend in the Figures throughout this
Course. Some are long and shallow and others are short and deep. One which is
interesting and worthy of examination is the large Rectangle which formed between
the 166 and 175 levels in US Steel following the first drop from the Rounding Top in
April, 1930. The break-out on the down side on Saturday, June 7, was confirmed by
a notable increase in activity, apparent if we follow the rule of doubling a Saturday’s
volume. This formation is shown in Fig. III.1.
The price congestion between January 23 and February 9 on the National Power
and Light chart (Fig. IV.9) may be construed as a Rectangle continuation with a one-
day out-of-line movement on January 27.
Flags and Pennants – Dependable Signals

types of Triangles and the Rectangle – have one
unfortunate characteristic in common, viz., they

and easily recognizable formations which do not
have reversal implications, and which do signal a resumption of the previous move-
ment at a level which permits the taking of a profitable position.
These two very dependable and profitable continuation patterns we have chosen
to call the Flag and the Pennant because of their obvious pictorial resemblance
on the charts to a flag and a pointed pennant, respectively, flying from a mast.

MAJOR CONTINUATION FORMATIONS
Fundamentally, they are compact and quickly completed areas of ‘‘correction’’ or
‘‘consolidation’’ in a fast mark-up or mark-down state. They may occur either early
or late in an intermediate or major trend, but always during a phase when prices are
advancing or declining with greater than normal rapidity.
The Flag Flies from a Mast
Thus, the first requirement of the Flag formation is a nearly vertical price movement
on the chart, either up or down. This is halted abruptly, usually but not always with
a day of high activity, and followed by several days to a few weeks of price conges-
tion within clearly defined parallel bounds. During this period the volume of activ-
ity tends to decline noticeably. In most cases, the parallel lines which bound the
congestion slope downward if the preceding trend was up, or upward if the pre-
ceding trend was down, but they may be horizontal or even be slightly tilted in the
same direction as the preceding trend. This, in an up-trend, forms the picture of a
rectangular flag flying from a mast, which usually, as we should expect, hangs some-
what downward of its own weight, but is occasionally blown straight out or even
slightly upward by a strong breeze. (In a down-trend, the picture is, of course,
turned upside down.)
At the end of the Flag, there is a sharp break-out with a marked pick-up in vol-
ume, and a resumption of the rapid price movement in the previous trend.
Examples of Flags in Upward Movements
The chart of Deere & Co. for the first half of 1936, shown in Fig. VI.14 formed in Feb-
ruary a typical Flag continuation pattern. After breaking out of a Symmetrical Tri-
angle on January 22, the price advanced 17 points to 75 in three weeks – an almost
vertical mark-up – a true mast. Then for three weeks the price fluctuated in a range
of about 31/2points between two down-slanting parallel lines, forming the Flag. On
March 2 the upper boundary was penetrated, but a decisive break-out did not
appear until March 5 when volume increased markedly and price closed at 74 (two
points out of the Flag pattern). In less than five weeks thereafter the price had
advanced to 89. (The student will notice the formation of a pattern at the top of this
movement out of which prices ‘‘spilled’’. This is almost too loose in construction to
be called a good Wedge but it did carry out the Wedge forecast).
The Flag formation in the Deere chart departs from the ideal in only one respect;
the area within the Flag itself is not as closely packed with price movement as is
sometimes the case. Nevertheless, this is a good average example.

MAJOR CONTINUATION FORMATIONS
Various Flag Aspects and Interpretations
A narrower and more compact Flag pattern appeared on a very short ‘‘mast’’ in the
chart of Burroughs Adding Machine (Fig. VI.9). In this case the compact action
within the Flag and the sharp break-out on September 5 were encouraging, but the
preceding mast was so short that we could not expect the continuation to carry very
far after the completion of the pattern. The subsequent movement was, in fact,
quickly halted and another formation (an Inverted Triangle) was required to lay the
foundation for a further advance.
Another Flag example appears in the chart of Sharon Steel Hoop, Fig. V.2. Note
that the break-out was not confirmed by increased volume until the price closed a
full point out of the pattern on February 6.
In long-continued rapid price movements several Flags may appear in quick suc-
cession. The chart of Greyhound Corporation (Fig. VI.15) shows several interesting
examples in March and April. The reader may to good advantage study in detail the
price and volume action throughout this chart.
Upward Flying Flags in Up-trends
The normal Flag picture in an upward price movement is, as we have seen in the
preceding examples, somewhat drooping or slanting downward from the mast on
which it forms. Less frequently we find continuation patterns in sharp mark-ups (or
mark-downs) which slant in the same direction as the preceding trend and must be
classified as Flags since they obey the same rules and do not permit of any other con-
struction. A good example of an upward flying flag in as ascending movement
appears in the late 1936 chart of International Harvester, (Fig. VI.16). Note the
‘‘mast’’ formed by the rapid advance of prices from September 17 to October 13, the

mast.
Flags may also develop between strictly hori-
zontal boundary lines, as was noted in our intro-
duction to this formation. Obviously, such horizontal patterns might be considered
Rectangle continuations which happen to be of compact formation and happen to
occur in rapid price movements. Whether we construe them as Flags or Rectangles
does not matter; the forecast is the same.

STUDY VI
Flags in Downward Movements
The Flag continuation pattern in a declining price trend is, of course, simply the
upside-down development of the pictures we have just analyzed in ascending
trends. The mast is formed first by a very rapid price mark-down; the flag is nor-
mally tilted slightly upward; volume tends to decline during its formation and then
picks up sharply as the price breaks the lower boundary; and then a further rapid
decline ensues.
For a typical example, refer to the 1931 chart of Columbian Carbon (Fig. VI.17).
After a sharp break from the February high of 1111/2down to 93 in two weeks, a wide
Flag formed during the first three weeks of March, and broke out into another rapid
decline on March 24. It is interesting to note, although it has no special significance,
that this Flag developed at the same time as the Rectangle continuation pattern pre-
viously illustrated in Electric Auto-Lite (Fig. VI.12).
The Pennant – Cousin to Flag and Wedge
The Pennant is simply a Flag formed within converging rather than parallel bound-
ary lines. With this single exception, it is similar in appearance, duration, volume
action, and interpretation to the normal Flag. On an upward pointing mast the Pen-
nant always points down and forecasts a rapid continuation of the upward move-
ment. In a down-trend it presents the opposite picture.
A good example of a Pennant in an up-trend appears in Fig. V.9, the Mack Trucks
chart. The break-out from the Rectangle which signaled the bottom reversal in this
stock in May, 1936, ran up into a 5-point mast on which a Pennant was ‘‘hung’’ by
the price action during the last two weeks of June and first part of July. A sharp
break-out on high volume resumed the previous upward movement.
The Columbian Carbon chart (Fig. VI.17) shows a Pennant formed as a continua-
tion pattern in a down-trend during the first two weeks of May, 1931.
Flags and Pennants in Weekly Charts
Just as is the case with most other technical formations, both Flags and Pennants are
to be found occasionally in charts of weekly price range, and also rarely in average
charts, and their implications are the same as in daily charts of individual issues.
Refer, for example, to the two Pennants in 1931 on the weekly chart of Standard Oil
of NJ, Fig. III.6.

STUDY VI
Relation of Pennant to Wedge Pattern
The reader will have noticed in his study of the Pennant examples cited above a
close resemblance to the Wedge formation which we treated as a Reversal in Study
III. There is no important distinction between them so far as regards their forecast of
a subsequent price movement in the direction opposite to that pointed by the for-
mation itself.
The Wedge Reversal, however, is a formation which usually, though not always,
continues within itself the previous price trend, and frequently works out into (and
occasionally even somewhat beyond) its theoret-
ical apex before the reversal occurs. The Pennant,

short period of time, in the direction opposite to
lines.
that of the mast. The Pennant seldom works out
into a point or apex before breaking out into a
continuation of the trend established by the mast (which is, of course, at the same
time a reversal of the pattern’s own trend).
The ‘‘Head and Shoulders’’ Continuation Pattern
Because the Head and Shoulders Reversal is the first technical formation studied,
and because of its distinctive appearance, it is only natural that students should call
by that name a certain type of price action which appears with fair frequency in an
intermediate relation to the general price trend. This formation is not a true Head
and Shoulders for a number of important reasons but we must admit that it is diffi-
cult to find a better name for it in view of its superficial resemblance to the Head and
Shoulders Reversal. Fortunately, when it is carefully analyzed, the forecast is arrived
at in the same way as the forecast from the Head and Shoulders. With the caution,
therefore, that the student be careful always to analyze the pattern thoroughly
before taking action on it, we shall accept the suggested name and call it the Con-
tinuation Head and Shoulders.
An Illustration in Crown Cork and Seal
It will be easier to describe and interpret the Continuation Head and Shoulders if we
refer at once to a very plainly pictured example of it, such as appears in the chart of
Crown Cork and Seal for the first half of 1936 (Fig. VI.18). The general upward trend
in this stock reached a minor climax at 54 on January 15, and was followed by over

STUDY VI
two months of generally indecisive price action. However, a dip on February 25 and
26 formed (when considered with reference to the subsequent movement) what we
may choose to call a left shoulder at A. The next dip on March 13, extending lower,
formed a head at B. And the third reaction on March 30 gave us a right shoulder at
C, with a neck-base line extended across the peaks made by the rallies on either side
of the head, shown by the dotted line on the chart. This was broken with a very
marked increase in activity on April 3, and prices thereupon advanced 10 points in
three weeks.
Often the Only Helpful Indication
In the example before us it so happens that the price action from March 9 to April 3
could be construed as a Symmetrical Triangle with its top boundary the same as the
neck-base line of our Continuation Head and Shoulders, and the bottom boundary
drawn across points B and C. However, this is not always so clearly the case with
formations of this type, and frequently the appearance of a Continuation Head and
Shoulders gives us our only definite clue as to what the subsequent trend will be. It
must be emphasized that the neck-base line is just as important a part of the pattern
as are the head and shoulders; until the neck-base line is decisively broken the pat-
tern has not been completed and has no forecasting value.
Other examples of Continuation Head and Shoulders patterns may be seen in
other Figures in this and preceding Studies. Refer to the following:
Fig. II.2 – Left shoulder at J, head at K, right shoulder at L. Neck-base line broken

ing and the true Head and Shoulders Reversal which was taken up in Study II, is the
fact that the former always appears in the opposite position with respect to the pre-
ceding general trend. Another notable difference will appear if we analyze the vol-
ume action. It will be recalled that the normal volume accompaniment to the true
Head and Shoulders Reversal is comparatively high volume on the left shoulder and
head, low volume between the two shoulders and the head, only very moderately
increased volume on the right shoulder and, finally, a pick-up in volume when the
neck-base line is decisively broken. Reference to our example of Continuation Head
and Shoulders in the Crown Cork and Seal chart (Fig. VI.18) shows, however, that
in this pattern high volume does not appear on the making of the shoulders or head,
but rather with the making of the rallies between
them. In our later, more detailed consideration of

only point, in fact, at which the Head and Shoulders

need to agree in their volume charts is the sharp pick-up on the breaking of the neck-
base line.
Review of Continuation Patterns
We have concluded in this section of our Course our consideration of clearly defined
patterns and areas of price action which may interrupt the movement of prices in an
established trend and lead at their completion to a continuation of that trend. It will
be advisable at this point to review briefly the continuation formations we have
studied and to re-classify them with a view to increasing our practical working
knowledge of their uses in trading.
With that in mind, it appears at once that the most important division we can
make in these formations is between those that may signal either reversal or contin-
uation, and those that normally signal only a continuation. In doing this, we must
remember that no technical formation is 100% dependable; there are exceptions to
every rule in technical analysis. For all practical purposes, however, the forecasts are
sufficiently established in the great majority of instances to enable us to make the fol-
lowing summary.

Their Application in Practical Trading
From the classification we have made above, the technical trader who is already ‘‘in’’
a stock will see that any appearance on his charts of a formation in Group 1 requires
vigilant attention since it may turn out to be a rever-
sal and call for his promptly closing out the trade. If,

vigilance for the moment at least, and ride along
with the trend until some other warning signal
appears. In certain cases (the Inverted Triangles, for
example) he may be well advised to close his trade without waiting for the break-
out especially if other charts are showing him at the same time apparently better
profit opportunities.
(In connection with Group 1 we have noted that there are often other factors out-
side of the formations themselves which may help us to anticipate whether reversal
or continuation is the more likely event.)
The appearance of any of the formations in Group 2 need not concern the trader
who has already made a commitment in the right trend; they represent only a tem-
porary delay in the increment of profit. Formations in Group 3 (and, of course, all of
the true reversal patterns and signals previously studied) call for closing out trades
and taking profits at the earliest favorable opportunity.

of any of the formations in Group 1, or in Groups 2 or 3 according to trend, repre-
sents simply an opportunity. He should be prepared to take whatever market action
the formation itself or the direction of the break-out indicates.
Formations Which Change Their Nature
We cannot close this discussion, however, without adding our customary word of
caution against ‘‘jumping the gun’’. We have noted in the preceding lessons that
Right-angle Triangles are ordinarily very reliable forecasters, but even they have
their exceptions. Right-angle Triangles occasionally break out in the wrong direc-
tion, i.e. through the hypotenuse side. When such break-outs occur, contrary to the
expectation of the preceding pattern, one of two things usually happens. One alter-
native is that prices continue on out to the level of the first reversal point of the pat-
tern and then make a Double Reversal formation – a Double Top in the case of a
Descending Triangle after an up-trend, or a Double Bottom in the case of an Ascend-
ing Triangle after a down-trend. In such cases the implications of the original Right-
angle Triangle are eventually carried out, but not until after a price movement of
some consequence in the opposite direction has intervened.
The other, and perhaps more frequent alternative, is that the Right-angle Triangle
is turned into a Rectangle. If this Rectangle becomes quite complete and distinctly
formed, the break-out from it may go in either direction just as it may out of any Rec-
tangle. For example, the formation in Anaconda (Fig. VI.4) from December 23 to Jan-
uary 23, might be construed as such a Rectangle. In this example, the break-out on
January 23 took prices in the direction already forecast by the Ascending Triangle,
but if prices had continued to fluctuate ‘‘in pattern’’ between 28 and 30 for, say,
another month, a break-out on the down side would have been equally probable.

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
In our preceding Studies we have taken up, first, technical formations or patterns
which signal reversal of the major or intermediate price trend, and, second, forma-
tions which signal continuation of the trend in which they appear. And some of
these, we have learned, may indicate either reversal or continuation but give us, in
either case, a reliable signal when they break out of pattern.
In this Study we shall take up a number of special formations and phenomena of
price action which have rather limited forecasting value in most cases but are, nev-
ertheless an essential part of the technical trader’s working knowledge.
The formations we shall consider are:
The Drooping Bottom and Accelerating Top
The Horn
The Inverted Horn
And, following that, we shall take up:
Gaps
Out-of-line Movements
Scallops and other Repeating Phenomena
But First Some General Considerations
In our introduction to the general group of continuation formations we noted that
there exist logical reasons for this type of intermediate formation, but that these rea-
sons are based, chiefly, on the fact that the continuation generally starts out as a pos-
sible reversal. Even when insiders are perfectly confident that they can push their
stock up another 30 points, the mere fact that they themselves may decide on an
intermediate period of rest and consolidation of the previous advance, indicates that
there is at least a bare possibility that the technical position will have to be reversed
and the additional 30 points sacrificed.
Since practically every intermediate formation shows some resistance to the pre-
vious straight movement, and since, in truth, the majority are merely stronger devel-
opments of what might, under weaker circumstances, be a reversal, it should be easy
to see why our cardinal reversal formations do not always work out according to
their usual reverse forecast, and why sometimes formations which look, at first, like
satisfactory examples of our reversal patterns, may eventually turn out to be merely
continuations.
For our more valuable and practical study, however, we may pass on, with this
realization, to consideration of a few specific formations which are, as a rule, sug-
gestive of intermediate patterns rather than reversal. Largely for the reasons already
considered in the present study and in our previous introduction to the subject of
continuations, our group of specific intermediate formations is not as large or

important as the group of reversal patterns.
We have already seen the large part which the various aspects of the triangular
pattern play in the entire group of continuation pictures. They are, in fact, the most
important single picture promising continuation of the previous movement. And
the most important of the formations which we shall take up in this section is merely
a specially developed aspect of the Right-angle Triangle. In its suggestion of the
Descending Triangle it takes the name of the Drooping Bottom. In its suggestion of
the Ascending Triangle our new intermediate formation takes the name of the
Accelerating Peak.
The Drooping Bottom
The Drooping Bottom is almost any kind of a price formation or congestion which
tends to come to a drooping point at the close of its development. The formation
need not be long. In fact, there are cases where hardly any area picture is discernible,
but the drooping point is always there. The Drooping Bottom is more often found,
however, developing as part of, or after, an area picture and most frequently, per-
haps, from some form of Triangle pattern. To particularize still further, the Drooping
Bottom is most frequent and most dependable as a continuation, when it forms the
last portion of a Descending Triangle, and in many instances it suggests almost a
special phase of that formation.
An interesting example which may be construed as a special phase of the
Descending Triangle, or as a drooping slump out of a Rectangle Reversal, is shown
in Fig. VII.I the chart of Chicago Pneumatic Tool for the first half of 1930. From
March 15 to April 5 this stock fluctuated between 34 and 37, with volume far above
normal levels, forming the suggestion of a Rectan-
gle which, as we have learned in previous studies,

Triangle but with a sagging or down-curving bot-
tom line. The bottom of the minor decline at A was
a little lower than the preceding minor bottoms, the next bottom B dropped even far-
ther, and C farther yet. Note that there had been up to this point no pick-up in vol-
ume to confirm a break-out of any pattern. Nevertheless, the whole picture was one
of weakness, apparent to the most casual observer. At C the stock had reached a
level where support might have been anticipated for reasons which we shall discuss
in detail in Study IX, but the decline to D, continuing the drooping picture, was con-
clusive.

STUDY VII
Continuation Suggestion Always Apparent
The weakness of the Drooping Bottom Formation is always very apparent, as in this
case. The stock sags and wilts away under our very eyes, and a child could almost
guess that the price would continue on down at an increasing rate.
The Drooping Bottom began to appear in the Chicago Pneumatic Tool chart at B.
A bold trader might have “gone short” of the stock at that point, but a more conser-
vative chartist would undoubtedly prefer to wait for a testing of the 31–32 support
level before taking a short position and would feel more certain of his forecast at D.
The Drooping Bottom formation implies a continuation of its downhill price
movement at a rapidly increasing pace until it reaches a selling climax. The volume
during the first stages of the formation tends to decline, and does not pick up until
the climax which is accompanied by a sharp burst of activity. Thereafter, a pattern of
some sort usually forms and develops a continuation of the downward movement
at a more reasonable pace, or, less often, perhaps, reverses the down trend into an
intermediate recovery. In the case of Chicago Pneumatic Tool there was an insignif-
icant congestion in the down-trend at the end of April, a sharp drop to 171/2on May
5 followed by an equally sharp recovery to the 22–24 zone, and then a resumption
of the downward movement to 12 and below.
Drooping Bottom Offers Quick Profits
The rapidity with which the movement gains headway and reaches its climax makes
the Drooping Bottom a very profitable pattern for the technical trader who acts upon
its implications promptly. However, he must be prepared to close out his ‘‘short’’
trade with equal promptness for, as we have suggested above, the movement may
be reversed after it reaches its climax almost as quickly as it started. An excellent
example of such a reversal is shown in the Inland Steel in Fig. VII.2. Without the
appearance, before it, of any very definite pattern, a Drooping Bottom began to
develop early in April, at points A, B, C and D. From 104, at D, the price dropped
precipitately to 92 in two weeks and to 90 in two weeks more, with volume sug-
gesting the climax appearing on April 30 at the 93 level. Here, however, a new pat-
tern – an Inverted Horn which we shall analyze later in this study – began to form,
suggesting reversal. After a month, the new up-trend got under way and by the end
of August the stock had climbed back to 114, the level from which the Drooping Bot-
tom started.

STUDY VII
Patterns with an Accelerating Peak
The pattern with an Accelerating Peak should be, of course, simply the upside down
image of the pattern with a Drooping Bottom. In practice, however, we almost never
find a pattern which must be classified as an Accelerating Peak and nothing else. In
other words, although we do sometimes find accelerating movements following
bottom formations, the formations themselves are almost invariably completed by a
recognizable break-out before the accelerating upward movement or ‘‘peak’’
becomes apparent. Consequently, the peak in those cases cannot be considered a
part of the pattern itself but only as serving to emphasize the urgency of the ‘‘buy’’
signal which the bottom formation and break-out had already given us.
And the same holds true of accelerating peaks or upward movements following
continuation formations in up-trends. The direction of the movement is almost
always signalled by an obvious break-out before the movement accelerates into a
peak.
The important point to note about formations which are followed, after a good
break-out, by an accelerating upward movement, is that the rapid up-curve in the
price track indicates a strong continuation to a climax of the upward movement
which was already forecast.
Part of the Rounding Bottom Reversal
No doubt it will have occurred to the student that the latter part of almost any
Rounding Bottom or Common Bottom Turn might be called an Accelerating Peak,
but here again we do not need the Accelerating Peak interpretation except to empha-
size or strengthen the implications of a formation which we have already recognized
as calling for higher prices. The volume action accompanying the Accelerating Peak
part of a Rounding Bottom, as well as that accompanying any accelerating up-curve
of prices following other types of bottom patterns, is comparable with the volume
action on a Drooping Bottom formation. That is, it is relatively low at first and then
picks up as the price movement speeds up, culminating finally in a burst of high
activity as the buying nears a climax.
Examples Without Previous Break-outs Very Rare
There is a good and logical reason for the rarity of formations which do not show
any ordinary decisive break-out but only a gradually accelerating upward move-
ment out of an otherwise unclassifiable congestion. This reason is expressed in the
– 226–

==================================================

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
familiar ‘‘street’’1adage that ‘‘prices can fall down of their own weight but have to
be pushedup’’. Unlike many old traders’ ‘‘saws’’ which are only half true or not true
at all, this saying is founded on indisputable fact. The fact is that most top reversals
occur when stocks have been distributed out of strong hands into weak and, with
strong support removed, very little pressure or volume of offerings is required to
start prices down out of an area in which distribution has been completed. This
accounts for the phenomenon we have already discussed (in connection with breaks
down out of Descending Triangles and Rectangles) of good and valid break-out sig-
nals based on only a price movement without volume accompaniment. At bottoms,
however, the action is different because it takes buying in large volume, relatively
speaking, to push prices up out of congestion and to start the mark-up stage.
An example of the very rare type of pattern which is difficult to classify by
any other feature except the Accelerating Peak, is shown in the Atchison chart in
Fig. VII.3, at the 1932 bottom in this stock. Volume during the period shown was
generally high and irregular except for the first part of July. The acceleration of
prices up out of the July bottom became clearly evident toward the end of the month
when average daily volume was also increasing notably.
Trading on the Accelerating Patterns
The accelerating upward movements of prices out of bottom congestion (or, for that
matter, out of intermediate formations in up-trends) offer the trader the same oppor-
tunities for quick profits on prompt action, as do the patterns with a Drooping Bot-
tom in a down-trend. Ordinarily it is good, sound practice to refrain from ‘‘chasing’’
the market. The beginner, at least, had better consider a movement which has
already reached the accelerating phase as a train that has left the station, and wait
for the next train rather than run after the one he has missed. Nevertheless, the
trader who keeps his charts posted up-to-date every day and who may therefore see
the accelerating picture developing in its early stages, and who further is in a posi-
tion to get in quickly and get out just as quickly when the climax appears to indicate
a reversal, is reasonably safe in chasing a movement of this type.
Another most important factor to be taken into account, before making a commit-
ment on the strength of an accelerating movement alone, is the past habits of the
stock under observation, and especially the probable support or resistance levels
that may limit the extent of the movement. These important limiting factors of sup-
port and resistance levels are to be taken up in detail in Study IX.

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
The Horn Formation
Our next intermediate pattern of limited forecasting value is the Horn – a quite
definite formation with points of similarity to both the Rounding Turn (Study III)
and the accelerating patterns previously discussed. In the converging of the lines
which bound the price action it has also a slight resemblance to the Triangle. Its
interpretation is almost precisely the same as that of the patterns with Drooping Bot-
toms or Accelerating Peaks. It calls, that is, for a rapid continuation of price move-
ment in the direction already pointed, to a climax at which there is usually a halt and
a congestion before another trend starts.
The Horn may occur at a reversal of intermediate trend, or as a continuation for-
mation. The chart of Certain-Teed Products for the first half of 1936, Fig. VII.4 shows
a Horn formation which signaled an intermediate
reversal in this stock. Note the ‘‘rolling over’’ of

this case, with the development of a price conges-
tion or temporary trading area around the 13 zone,
out of which prices again dropped rapidly the first week in June. The congestion at
13-14 might conceivably have developed a forecasting pattern calling for another
reversal, into an up trend, since the Horn itself does not forecast any certain move-
ment much beyond the ensuing climax. In this case, however, no forecasting pattern
or ‘‘foundation’’ for an upward move was built, and the downward trend was
quickly resumed.
The chart of Standard Oil of California, Fig. VII.5 shows a Horn at the bottom of a
minor reversal in the Fall of 1935.
The Horn as a Continuation Formation
The Chrysler chart, Fig. VII.6 shows the price action of this stock during the first half
of 1929. (It is interesting to note that Chrysler made its “high” for the bull market of
the 20s at 140 in October, 1928 – a full year ahead of the general market averages). In
the rapid downward movement of this stock during the period shown, a brief rally
in mid-April was quickly halted and turned into a Horn which again pointed prices
down.
We refer to the example of a Horn in the Chrysler chart as a continuation, and to
that in the Certain-Teed chart as a reversal, because of the relation which the Horn

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
pattern bears in each case to the preceding general movement. It is, of course, obvi-
ous that the Horn contains within itself a minor reversal; while the narrow, acceler-
ating end of it forecasts a continuation of its own trend to a climax just as do the
patterns with Drooping Bottoms or Accelerating Peaks previously studied.
The Inverted Horn
A price pattern shaped like a Horn but with its narrow end forming first, appears
much less frequently on the charts than the normal Horn formation. The Inverted
Horn also contains within itself a minor reversal of price trend, but the extent of the
following movement in the new trend may be quite limited.
A typical Inverted Horn appears in the Inland Steel chart (Fig. VII.2) formed by
the price action from the latter part of April to the first part of June.
The forecast of an Inverted Horn may be compared with the forecast of an
Inverted Triangle. Both are widening patterns of rather limited usefulness and not
very easy to convert to profit.
Concluding the Study of Area Formations
Up to this point, we have been studying formations or area patterns of price action
which indicate, either by their own construction or by the break-out which follows
them, the direction of the ensuing price movement. We have finished with these and
are now ready to take up the study of certain other phenomena of price action which
cannot be called formations or patterns but which often have forecasting implica-
tions, either by themselves or when considered in connection with accompanying
patterns.
The first of these special phenomena is the out-of-line price movement which
occurs only in connection with some one of the definite reversal or continuation for-
mations we have previously analyzed, and only after such a formation has already
become clearly defined on our charts.
Out-of-line Movements
We had a first, brief look at an ‘‘out-of-line’’ price movement in our detailed exami-
nation of the Descending Triangle reversal on the Nash chart, Fig. III.10. A probable
explanation for it was suggested in Study. III, page 93.
Out-of-line movements are not common but they appear with sufficient frequency
on our charts to warrant our giving them some further consideration. They are
found most often in Right-angle Triangles and Rectangles, but may develop also on
occasion in any of the other formations we have studied. Or, perhaps, we should say

that they develop ‘‘out of rather’’ than ‘‘in’’, because an out-of-line movement is, in
fact, a sharp thrust of prices away from an already established pattern. This thrust,
however, is quickly reversed and prices return within the pattern.
Most out-of-line movements are completed within a single day and are called,
quite naturally, One-day Out-of-lines. Less often the price may stay out of line for
two or three days, especially if the basic formation
is large. As a rule, the out-of-line price movement is

completed in a single day, the closing price for that
day is usually back within or, at least, very near the
previously defined pattern.
Sometimes Resembles a True Break-out
Although it does not happen often, there are exceptional cases when the out-of-line
thrust will take the price quite a distance out of the pattern and result in closing a
full point or more away from its boundary. When these thrusts are made on con-
spicuously high volume they may have all the appearance of, and comply with all
the requirements for, a valid break-out. It is this last described out-of-line action
which is apt to be confusing to the technical trader, and may well lead him into tak-
ing a premature position in a stock. He sees the sharp price thrust confirmed by
good volume, and the closing well away from the pattern; he construes it, naturally,
as a break-out and places an order with his broker accordingly. And then he sees the
stock go back into the pattern and stay there for several days, possibly even for a
week or two.
Fortunately, the forecast of an out-of-line movement is for a fairly quick comple-
tion of the pattern and then a real break-out in the same direction as the previous
out-of-line movement so, except for some little delay and, perhaps, a bit of mental
wear and tear, no harm has been done. The stock eventually moves in the ‘‘right’’
direction.
To return, however, to the more normal appearance of the out-of-line movement,
it is obvious that when the price does not close out of pattern by a decisive margin,
no matter how high the volume, we do not have a good break-out and, conse-
quently, should not be led to act prematurely. Instead we have a very helpful indi-
cation, first of the approaching completion of the pattern and, second, of the
direction of the ensuing price trend.

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
Examples of Out-of-line Movement
We have mentioned above the out-of-line movement on the Nash chart in Study III
and it is suggested that the student turn back at this point, if he has not already done
so, and re-read the description and explanation of it on page 95.
A typical example of the One-Day Out-of-Line appears in Fig. VII.7, the 1934 chart
of Johns-Manville. Commencing with the last week of September the price action of
this stock began to build what appeared at first as though it might become an
Ascending Triangle. Then, when the price dropped to 46 on October 23 and rallied
on the next day to the general level of the three preceding minor tops, the pattern
began to suggest a Rectangle. In either case a well-defined top boundary line had
been established and the decline in volume during the construction of this price area
was bearing out the deduction that a pattern of some forecasting consequence was
in process of completion.
On October 25, however, the performance of Johns-Manville stock was rather star-
tling. With a conspicuous burst of activity which resulted in a volume greater than
on any day for months before, the price was marked up to 501/4, a point and a quar-
ter above our pattern’s top boundary. If we had been following the tape on that day
we should certainly have been led to believe that a decisive break-out was occurring
and giving a signal to buy Johns-Manville at once. But if we waited until that night
or the following morning when we could post the full day’s price and volume action
on our chart, we found that the movement had reversed itself during the day, and
that the closing price was near the bottom of the range and a point below the criti-
cal boundary line. There had been no ‘‘break-out’’, by the tests we have learned to
apply. The price track of the stock for the next eight trading days fell within the
bounds of the previously suggested Rectangle and it was not until November 5 that
a decisive break-out appeared, meeting all the requirements as to penetration, vol-
ume and closing. The price action on October 25 was a One-day Out-of-line.
The Interpretation of the Out-of-line Action
It is evident from our analysis of the Johns-Manville chart that a trader who bought
the stock on October 25 when it had moved up to 50 would have been sold out on
the next day thereafter if he had placed a stop-loss order at, say, 471/2. And if he had
not placed a stop, he would at best have gained nothing by his hasty action and had
over a week to wait before his trade got out of the ‘‘red’’. To the trader who did not
act prematurely, however, the one-day out-of-line gave valuable information. It sug-
gested, first, that the pattern of price trend would be up, in the direction of the out-
of-line movement.

STUDY VII
We would not have the student believe that the forecast of an out-of-line move-
ment is infallible for no technical pattern or phenomenon is 100% reliable. It is
extremely seldom, however, that a thrust of this character out of and then back
within a clearly defined pattern, is not followed by the two results we have named
in the last sentence of the preceding paragraph as the out-of-line implications.
Out-of-line for Two Days
Another good example of out-of-line action is illustrated by the 1936 chart of Warner
Brothers Pictures, Fig. VII.8. Dropping from 141/2early in the year, the decline was
halted the first week in May at 9. Thereafter the price track built a rather loose Sym-
metrical Triangle out of which there was an attempt to break on June 1; the volume
on that day was notable but the price closed at 10, barely out of the pattern, which
prevented us from interpreting this as a break-out day. It might, however, be called
an out-of-line movement suggesting, certainly, that the technical picture was chang-
ing and that a foundation for a reversal of the previous decline was being laid.
After this attempt to break out which failed on June 1, Warner Brothers fluctuated
for three weeks in the 91/2–101/2zone, now making the semblance of a Rectangle on
the chart. On June 24 another day of high volume appeared and the price moved up
to 10, closing at 105/8. This time the closing was out of pattern but again not by a deci-
sive margin. On the following day the price was pushed to 107/8 but fell back and
closed at the Rectangle’s top boundary. Here was a very good example of an out-of-
line movement which lasted two days. It signaled the near completion of the for-
mation to be followed by a true break-out on the up-side. The break-out, meeting all
requirements, came on Saturday, July 11.
The Out-of-line from a Symmetrical Triangle
The student will no doubt have noticed that, whereas the out-of-line movement on
June 24 and 25, out of the rectangular pattern, was followed by the normal out-of-
line forecast, the out-of-line action on June 1 required the building of a considerably
longer pattern before the upward trend was started. There are two reasons for this.
The first is that an out-of-line movement through a well-defined horizontal bound-
ary, representing presumably either support or resistance, carries greater weight in
technical forecasting than an out-of-line movement out of a Symmetrical Triangle or
a Rounding formation. Thus an out-of-line movement down through the bottom of
a Descending Triangle, or up through the top of an Ascending Triangle, or through
either boundary of a Rectangle, has emphatic significance.
In the case of a Symmetrical Triangle on the other hand, we have to begin with a
pattern whose boundaries are less definite; the lines which establish its sides fre-

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
quently have to be re-drawn several times before the pattern is completed. If an out-
of-line movement occurs near the theoretical apex, it may be called a break-out that
fails, as in the Warner Brothers chart; when that failure becomes apparent we should
quite naturally expect some further foundation to be laid. The sequence of events
which we have seen in the Warner Brothers chart is a very common one; first, a nar-
row Symmetrical Triangle; then, an out-of-line movement which becomes, in turn, a
part of a rectangular picture; finally, a break-out of the Rectangle, often preceded by
an out-of-line movement of good forecasting value.
Out-of-line Examples in Previous Studies
Beside the movement in Nash cited previously, there are other examples in the
charts illustrating our earlier lessons. The rally in Case starting on June 10, 1932,
shown in Fig. III.2, may be construed as an out-of-line movement in the Rounding
Bottom pattern already becoming evident at that time. The action of prices on
November 27, 1933, in the Hudson Motors chart, Fig. III.11, is an out-of-line move-
ment, with the usual consequences. The formation at the bottom of the Chrysler
chart in Fig. IV.7 may be interpreted as a Rectangle with an out-of-line movement
May 26 to 28.
In our later study of Trend Line action we shall see that out-of-line movements can
occur through established trend lines as well as out of patterns.
The Zig-zag Movement
The next phenomenon of price action we have to study is the Zig-Zag. It may be con-
sidered as a cousin of the Out-of-Line since it is made up of two movements out of
line with the preceding picture, but these two movements protrude in opposite
directions. The Zig-Zag is not as common as the simple out-of-line, however, and
has only a very limited forecasting value. It may appear at any time or place in the
chart picture, though it is usually found in connection with a fairly established trend
and almost never in connection with a definite area formation.
The Zig-Zag is a movement which stands out from the rest of the trend and takes
the form of a sharp out-of-line movement in one direction, quickly reversed, and
then followed very shortly thereafter by just as noticeable a thrust out-of-line in the
opposite direction. The first sharp movement may be called the Zig and the second,
in the opposite direction, the Zag. The suggested forecast is that, following the com-
pletion of the Zag, there will shortly be another break out of the established trend in
the direction of the first out-of-line movement, or the Zig. This forecast is fairly reli-

able but only for a limited movement which may also be quite moderate in rapidity
or sharpness.
Examples of the Zig-zag Movement
An excellent example of the Zig-Zag showed up on the Loew’s chart for 1936,
Fig. VII.9. Note the upward trend of this stock starting in June, within clearly
defined parallel bounds. On August 12, however, there was a sharp thrust up out of
line, which was reversed and returned within bounds on August 14. This in itself
could be construed as an Out-of-line movement and, if nothing had happened to off-
set it, it would call for another break through on the up-side to follow shortly, and
the establishment of a new, possibly ‘‘steeper’’, trend. But something did happen to
offset it; the minor reaction from the first out-of-line carried right down into an
equally sharp thrust through the lower line on August 21. Then prices came back
within the previous trend and, instead of a simple Out-of-line, we now had a Zig-
zag, the Zig occurring on August 12 and the Zag on August 21. This called for
another limited movement in the direction of the Zig, and it came, right on sched-
ule, so to speak, on September 10.2
Note that the Zig-zag is not completed until the second out-of-line movement, the
Zag, has reversed and returned within the basic trend or pattern. In brief, each thrust
must protrude sharply beyond the established trend or pattern and each must return
within it before we have a Zig-zag movement calling for a third movement in the
direction of the Zig.
In extent of movement, the example in the Loew’s chart might be called a good
average example of a Zig-zag. The technical student will occasionally find Zig-zags
which protrude much more conspicuously from the basic trend or pattern. The third
movement in the direction of the Zig may be expected to proceed at least as far out
of line as the Zig and can, of course, go even farther, but the forecast of the Zig-zag
by itself is limited.
Recurrent Patterns of Price Action
Every student of the stock charts has noticed many instances of certain issues mov-
ing in patterns which repeat themselves over and over again with amazing regular-
ity. We know, of course, that major business cycles produce major up and down
trends in securities, which produce a repeating pattern of ‘‘hills and valleys’’ on the
charts, but the variance in timing of these major swings is too great to permit us to
trade on them by means of the time factor alone. We know, further, that there appear
2 Of special interest to devotees of the Elliott Wave Principle, this section on ‘‘Zig-zags’’ should prove use-
ful in combination with Elliott’s writing on the subject.

to be seasonal swings in certain individual stocks and in certain industrial groups of
stocks, but here again there are so many exceptions, caused by other factors which
upset the seasonal cycle, that it is impossible consistently to trade on them with
profit.
However, there do appear on occasion in the charts of individual issues repeating
patterns or cyclical movements within the major trends, and even within the inter-
mediate swings, which seem to have no relation to

again.
As a fair illustration of such habit patterns within
a major trend we may refer to the weekly charts of
Chesapeake & Ohio and Commercial Solvents which are reproduced, side by side,
in Fig. VII.10. These show the intermediate declines and recoveries during the
greater part of the long bear market following the 1929 tops.
In the Chesapeake & Ohio chart the habit is one of sharp and quickly reversed bot-
toms alternating with rather heavy and somewhat rounding tops. This picture is
‘‘broken’’ at only one point where the bottom in June, 1930 did not extend down into
as sharp a climax as did the other bottoms. Possibly the anticipated 4 for 1 split in
the stock accounted for that exception.
In the Commercial Solvents chart, on the other hand, the habit is quite different.
The price action is heavier and more rounding at the bottoms, and sharper and more
peaked at the tops. These two charts are not shown as perfect examples of recurrent
patterns but rather to illustrate the general proposition that different stocks show
different habits even in their long-term cyclical movements. However, these long-
term habits are not what we are particularly concerned with in this Study; rather we
are interested in similar habit pictures which develop in the current movements
within the intermediate trends.
The Scallop – an Opportunity and a Warning
One of the recurrent patterns which appears with fair frequency is the Scallop, illus-
trated in the chart of Container-A for the first nine months of 1935, Fig. VII.11. Note
the regularity of the minor advances and declines within the gradually declining
trend of the stock to June and on through the first three months of the upward trend
into September. The regularity or periodicity of the minor bottoms is particularly
noticeable, each bottom being made about six weeks after the preceding one.
A logical explanation for such pictures as this would be difficult to find but, after

all, an explanation is not necessary. All we need to do is to observe the sequence or
recurrence of the waves of price action after a few such waves have pictorialized
themselves on our chart, to realize that we have a phenomenon of technical value.
Such a phenomenon of recurring price action, having once made itself apparent,
may be assumed to repeat itself indefinitely until some new factor enters the picture
to disturb its rhythm.
In the Chart of Container A the student can see for himself how abruptly the pat-
tern was destroyed the first week in October. The movement immediately thereafter,
which does not show on this chart, may be described briefly as a rapid advance in
six weeks to 19, a sidewise movement for four weeks, and then another 4-point
advance in a single week’s time.
Obviously the scallop picture, as soon as it becomes apparent (which in the case
of the Container A chart might well have been by the first week in May), offers the
technical trader repeated opportunities for quick profits. Any one transaction in the
stock may show only a small profit, but the aggregate of all the possible ‘‘turns’’ can
certainly become very well worthwhile.
The Warning Given by Recurring Movements
Another type of ‘‘scallop’’ action is illustrated in the 1936 Commercial Solvents
chart, Fig. VII.12. Here we have a repetition of movements which might have mis-
led an inexperienced trader into taking a premature position. the upward thrust in
each case gave every appearance of starting a profitable movement, but each was
stopped short and the price fell off again. A pattern of this sort warns us not to trust
any apparent break-out signals until the chart shows that the continuity is broken
and the stock has shaken off its ‘‘bad habits’’.
Trading on a recurring price movement, it goes without saying, requires first a
thorough study of the stock’s chart history and then the ability to act promptly and
decisively, plus readiness to abandon a position the minute some unexpected price
or volume action indicates a change in the picture.
The Price Gap – an Interesting but Often Puzzling
Phenomenon
Out next subject for study – the price gap – is one concerning which much has been
written. Many theories have been built around the occurrence of point size gaps and
many claims stated as to their forecasting value. Taken at face value, and without
careful research and practical testing, these theories might easily lead the student of
technical action to believe that gaps were of major importance in forecasting market
movements. The Gap does have a a place in technical forecasting, but its value is

chiefly confirmatory or modifying in connection with other chart implications, and
in many cases, as we shall see, a Gap cannot be classified and given its correct inter-
pretation at the time it is formed. Gaps, therefore, belong not among our important
formations and forecasting factors but rather among our secondary chart phenom-
ena of limited usefulness. We must recognize them, appraise them at their true
value, and use them when we can.
General Description of the Gap
We have already had a rather superficial introduction to the Gap in our analysis of
the Island Reversal formation in Study V (see pages 168–9), but the Gap family is
large and worthy of detailed examination. In Study
V it was explained that the Gap is a stretch of ‘‘open

trading days as pictorialized on our stock charts. In
forecasting.
other words, it is merely a failure of the daily price
ranges to overlap. On the up-side, a Gap is formed
by the low point of one day’s range being higher than the high point of the previous
day’s range; on the down-side, it is formed by the high point of any day’s range
falling below the low point of the previous day’s chart range.
Gaps More Common in Thin Markets
Since the normal movement of prices is generally rather gradual and results in the
common or normal overlapping of one day’s price range by the next, it stands to rea-
son that failure to overlap and the consequent appearance of a Gap must be the
result of an abnormally rapid change in the technical position. This is quite true as
regards Gaps formed in the chart of an actively traded stock, but even in such cases
the abnormal condition is usually corrected at an early date and the price swings
back again into its more normal overlapping habit of fluctuation.
When, however, a stock has a ‘‘narrow’’ market, i.e. when it is inactive, little
known, or has only a small number of shares outstanding, the formation of Gaps
may be, and usually is, merely the result of this thin market condition. In such cases
the appearance of Gaps is not to be considered in any sense an abnormal occurrence.
In ‘‘thin’’ stocks the overlapping tends to be spread out over several days or weeks,
whereas in active issues we expect it to occur daily.
The chart of Allied Chemical (Fig. VII.13) illustrates the frequent formation of
Gaps in a thin stock. It is obvious that these Gaps have no technical importance,
being simply the natural result of a narrow market in a relatively ‘‘unpopular’’ stock
with a very small floating supply.

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
Stocks of fairly large issue that have ordinarily an active market may at times fall
out of popular favor or become temporarily inactive for various reasons, and during
these periods will form many Gaps which are of no importance in our study. Note,
for example, the many Gaps in the latter half of the chart of Sharon Steel Hoop, Fig.
V.2, during a period of inactive trading in this stock.
Gaps Fall Into Four Classifications
Having disposed of the gaps in thin stocks for the present at least, we must return
now to the study of their significance in the charts of actively traded issues where,
as we have seen, they picture an abnormal technical condition. We shall find that
these Gaps may be classified into four groups as follows:
1. The Common Gap
2. The Break-Away Gap
3. The Continuation Gap
4. The Exhaustion Gap
This classification depends on where and how the Gap forms and also, to some
extent, as we have already remarked, on what happens afterwards.
The Common Gap – Soon Covered
The Common Gap, in technical terminology is the type of Gap which occurs char-
acteristically in nervous markets, and which is generally ‘‘closed’’ within a few days
or within a week or two at the most. A Gap is said to be closed when the price range,
on some futuredate, returns to overlap the range immediately preceding the Gap, in
which case the ‘‘open water’’ between the ranges disappears. Until this occurs the
Gap is said to remain ‘‘open’’.
The Common Gap generally forms during the process of development of some
area pattern. The student will find innumerable examples in the charts illustrating
our previous studies or, for that matter, in almost any chart he cares to study. In the
Johns-Manville chart, Fig. III.12, there are several between points B and F. In the
Mack Trucks chart, Fig. V.9 there are seven Gaps inside the Rectangle Bottom for-
mation. There are a number within the Inverted Triangle on the Sears Roebuck chart,
Fig. VI.6. The Broadening Tops in Air Reduction and United States Steel, Figs IV.14
and IV.15 respectively, and the Inverted Triangle which almost became a Broaden-
ing Top in Standard Oil of NJ, Fig. VI.7 all show Gaps in greater frequency than we
should expect during the ordinary trends of these stocks. Note that these occur dur-
ing active but ‘‘nervous’’ markets. Note also that about the only forecast we can

==================================================

STUDY VII
place upon Gaps of this type is that they will soon be covered, and so carry no great
significance in technical analysis.
The Break-away Gap
The Break-away type of Gap is, in most respects, just about the opposite of the Com-
mon Gap. It appears at the beginning of a movement and generally comes at the
completion of some definite area formation. It is seldom covered for some time in
the future and, when it proceeds from a strong major bottom formation, it may never
be covered, or at least not until the return of prices in the next great cycle some years
later. The Break-away Gap is comparatively uncommon and indicates a definite
change in the technical picture. It suggests that the technical position of the stock has
suddenly become so weak or so strong that the normal balance of buying and sell-
ing has been thrown far out of line, as evidenced by the absence of the normal lap-
ping of price ranges. The logical conclusion is, therefore, for a continuation of that
lack of balance and a strong movement in the direction toward which the Gap was
made.
Examples of Break-away Gaps
If we turn back again to the Johns-Manville chart, Fig. III.12, we can easily and
quickly see the difference between the Common and Break-Away types of Gaps. The
Break-away Gap appears at J, following the formation of the strong Ascending Tri-
angle with its many nervous Common Gaps.
Other good examples of Break-away Gaps are to be found in the Pullman chart,
Fig. IV.13 at the breaking of the neck line of the Complex Bottom; in the Auburn
chart, Fig. V.10 at the break-out from the Continuation Triangle in May; in the Elec-
tric Boat, chart Fig VI.1 at the break-out of the long Triangle in November; in the
Electric Auto-Lite chart, Fig. VI.12, at the break-out from the Continuation Rectan-
gle in April; and in the Columbian Carbon chart, Fig. VI.17, at the break-out from the
Flag in March; also in the New York Central chart, Fig. III.14, at the break-out from
the Wedge in February. None of these Gaps, it will be noted, occurred inside the pat-
tern; in each case the pattern was already well-defined and the Gap appeared when
prices broke away from the pattern.
Apparent Break-away Gaps that Are Later Closed
There are cases, however, in which a Gap is formed at a break-away from a pattern
and then prices return to close the Gap and build an addition on the pattern, so to
speak, before the real break-out occurs. An example of this action may be seen in the

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
Republic Steel Chart, Fig. II.1. The price track in this chart from early July to August
8 formed a Symmetrical Triangle out of which prices broke with a Gap on the down-
side on August 9, and closed near the bottom of the day’s range. Except for the fact
that there was no appreciable increase of volume, this action appeared to be a valid
break-out calling for a decline. Instead, prices on the following day worked back and
closed on the lower edge of the Gap, and on the next trading day the Gap was closed
and prices went on to build another Triangle out of which a break-out developed on
the up-side on August 23. The volume on the day when the Gap was closed was
notably higher than on the day it was made. In this case the experienced technical
trader would not have been misled because, as we have learned, a break-out from a
Symmetrical Triangle should be confirmed by volume before action is taken upon it.
(Note: a decisive break down out of a formation with a well-defined horizontalbot-
tom boundary does not require volume confirmation on the break-out day itself. In
many such cases – Right angle Triangles and Rectangles, for example – volume does
not show up until the next day or the second day following the break-out. Breaks out
of Symmetrical Triangles, on the other hand, should be regarded with suspicion
until they are confirmed by volume.)
Difficulty of Immediate Classification
Such apparent exceptions as that in the Republic Steel chart which we have just dis-
cussed, occasionally lead the skeptic to object that the differentiation between the
Common and the Break-away Gap is merely the definition of two opposite possibil-
ities, one or the other of which must, of necessity, be true. For instance, any Gap
which is covered at an early date cannot, by its very definition, be considered a
Break-away Gap, while any Gap which leads prices so far away from the previous
formation as to keep the Gap from being covered for a long time, is quite naturally
indicative of a long move to follow. This is a real objection to our definition of these
two types of Gaps, but not necessarily an objection that completely destroys the uses
of Gaps in forecasting.
As a matter of fact, it is always difficult and frequently impossible to be certain
whether a Gap is of the Common or Break-away variety at the instant that the Gap
appears. This is the principal reason why we cannot place too much credence in the
various Gap theories and why we must consider Gaps as of only secondary impor-
tance in forecasting.
The fact remains that most Gaps which lead decisively out of an established pat-
tern are not closed; they become and remain true Break-away Gaps. And the wider
the Gap at a break-out, the less likely it is to be closed.

STUDY VII
The Practical Uses of the Break-away Gap
It is apparent, of course, that any Gap which appears when prices break out of a
technical formation, makes that break-out all the more conspicuous. The Gap helps
to draw our attention to the price action on the chart, so it performs one useful ser-
vice in this respect no matter how limited its other functions may be.
Further, the formation of the Gap at such a point is prima-facie evidence that a
drastic change has taken place in the technical position of the stock. It is logical to
assume, therefore, that the ensuing movement will
be more rapid, at the start at least, than a movement
The Break-away Gap
following an ordinary break-out without a Gap,

and this inference is, in fact, borne out in a majority
of prices.
of cases. A further inference that the movement fol-
lowing the Break-away Gap will be more extensive
or important because of the sudden change in the technical position, is difficult to
prove in practical chart analysis, but there are, as a rule, other factors more helpful
and more important technically to guide us in this respect. The size and character of
the pattern which forms the foundation of the movement, for example, and the
prospective levels where resistance may later be encountered (which we shall take
up later in Study IX), are of far greater importance in forecasting than the Break-
away Gap alone.
In brief, the Break-away Gap emphasizes the break-out of prices and indicates a
sudden change in the technical picture, but the mere fact that prices have broken
decisively out of a technical formation is of greater importance than the Gap. When
the evidence of the Gap is added to all the other evidences of a decisive break-out,
we are encouraged to act promptly and decisively.
Continuation and Exhaustion Gaps
We have discussed the Common Gap which is a quickly ‘‘closed’’ Gap appearing
within a formation or general area of price congestion, and the Break-away Gap
which appears at the break of prices out of a formation and is not closed for a long
time. There remain two other varieties of Gaps which are hardly likely to be con-
fused with the first two, but may be difficult to distinguish from each other at the
time they appear. These are the Continuation and Exhaustion Gaps.
The chart of Woolworth for the latter half of 1936, Fig. VII.14, will help to make
clear the appearance of Continuation and Exhaustion Gaps, and contains a number
of points which will warrant careful study. Incidentally, it will be of interest to com-
pare this chart with the Woolworth chart for the six months immediately preceding

in Fig. II.5 and to note the strong upward drive to 71 which followed the formation
of the Head and Shoulders Bottom.
Starting with the second week in October, the Gap in Woolworth marked A must
obviously be classified as a Break-away Gap, emphasizing the strong technical posi-
tion which this stock had developed. This was followed in quick succession by Gaps
at B, C and D. Note that these Gaps formed after the price had already moved well
away from the preceding congestion, and in the course of a continuous rapid move.
They certainly could not be classified as Break-away Gaps, and we should have no
reason to suspect, having in mind the previous foundation, that they would be
quickly closed and become part of another area pattern. B and C are typical Contin-
uation Gaps, indicating the continuation of the current move at a rapid pace. D pre-
sented a somewhat different picture from B and C when it first appeared. We shall
return to a more detailed analysis of this Gap at D later but will pass on now to Gaps
E, F and G.
Relation of Continuation to Break-away Gaps
The Gap at E, like that at A, is clearly a Break-away Gap occurring as prices broke
out of the Pennant formation. The Gap at F is probably also best classified as a Break-
away Gap although a break-out from the small congestion resembling an Ascending
Triangle had already been signaled on November 13. We may, if we choose, call the
price movement on November 13 a One-day Out-of-line, and call the movement on
the 16th the real break-out. This, however, is not important. A Continuation Gap
may, in fact, be considered as only a specialized form of the Break-away Gap, or vice-
versa, since both indicate the rapid continuation of a movement. One occurs at the
beginning of the movement and the other after it has started, and neither is covered
for some time. The Gap at F in our Woolworth chart may, therefore, be also classified
as a Continuation Gap, and such it surely is if we disregard the hesitation in the
63–64 price zone and view our Gap in relation only to the advance from 60 to 71.
The Gap at G is again clearly a Continuation Gap, but at H we have a much wider
Gap followed by a reversal day, accompanied by very high volume, and the end of
the advance. The Gap at H was an Exhaustion Gap, signalling the last spurt of activ-
ity which ‘‘exhausts’’ a movement and foretokens an early correction or intermedi-
ate reversal.
Characteristics of the Exhaustion Gap
The Exhaustion Gap is the fourth and last of our important types of Gaps. It is the
logical complement of the Gap series. The Common Gap indicates only minor
changes, generally within a congestion area; the Break-away denotes the beginning

==================================================

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
of a strong trend; the Continuation Gap promises the rapid continuation of such a
trend; and the Exhaustion Gap suggests the completion of the movement and an
early reversal.
It will be seen that the Exhaustion and Continuation Gaps can easily be confused.
There is no criterion by which we can positively identify a Gap appearing in a rapid
movement as of either the Continuation or Exhaustion variety on the day it shows
up on the chart. There are, however, a number of fairly reliable clues which enable
us to arrive at a correct appraisal in a majority of cases. First, the Exhaustion Gap
appears after an extensive move, a move which has carried out, as nearly as we can
judge, all of the forecast of the formation from which it sprung. It occurs usually at
the end of a very rapid mark-up or mark-down and is seldom the first Gap in such
a movement. The rapid advances or declines which lead to the extreme over-bought
or over-sold conditions that produce Exhaustion Gaps, contain as a rule (although
not always) one or more other Gaps which are obviously of the Continuation class.
Exhaustion Gaps Made on High Volume
Second, an Exhaustion Gap is almost invariably made by a day of conspicuously
high activity. Note the volume on November 17 in the Woolworth chart. In other
words, the Exhaustion Gap, representing the climax of a rapid movement, is accom-
panied by the extremely high volume which we expect to denote climaxes or sud-
den reversals. Third, the price action on the day following the Gap usually, although
not always, shows a One-day Reversal. And, fourth, the price action on the follow-
ing day or two generally leaves us in no further doubt because the Exhaustion Gap
is quickly closed. Finally, the Exhaustion Gap is more often than not wider than
Gaps of the Continuation variety.
With these points in mind, let us go back on the Woolworth chart to the series of
Gaps at A, B, C and D. The Gap at A, as we have already seen, is quickly identified
as a Break-Away. That at B is a Continuation, the only respect in which it departs
from what we might consider the ideal for that type being the closing of prices at the
bottom of the following day’s range (October 8). We should note, however, that this
Gap did not occur after a movement commensurate with the preceding pattern and
break-out action; also that the volume on October 8 was appreciably less than on the
7th.
An Exhaustion Gap of Only Temporary Effect
The Gap at C is unquestionably a Continuation; the volume on October 10 was high
but not extreme and the closing price was at the top of the day’s range. D, however,
certainly presents a different picture. To begin with it is, for this stock, an extraordi-

STUDY VII
narily wide Gap – two full points – following a very rapid advance of considerable
extent. Even more noteworthy is the climactic volume on October 13 and the One-
Day Reversal produced by the price action on that day. The Gap at D had all of the
‘‘earmarks’’ of Exhaustion and, perhaps, the only consideration which would have
caused us to reserve judgment at this time was the recognition of the extremely
important foundation for an extensive upward movement that had been laid during
the previous several months.
Nevertheless, the Gap at D did signal a temporary exhaustion of buying power, as
quickly became apparent, and the formation of another pattern was required to
gather strength, so to speak, for a continuation of the upward trend. This pattern
took the form of a Pennant which as we have seen in Study VI, is one of our most
dependable continuation formations. The intervention of this strong pattern, plus
the fact that it was completed before the preceding Gap was entirely closed, gave
ample evidence that the movement was not by any means finished. The Gap at D
was, therefore, an Exhaustion Gap of only temporary significance.
The Exhaustion Gap Not Common
The Exhaustion Gap is the least frequently encountered of the four general Gap
types, and not all Exhaustion Gaps are as clearly and fully marked by all the usual
clues as were those we have analyzed in the Woolworth chart. Another example
which may be studied appears in Fig. VI.8. The Gap between August 16 and 17 was
an Exhaustion Gap but not clearly indicated as such until closed by the following
day’s price action. Note, however, the climactic volume on the 17th, following the
rule of doubling a Saturday’s volume. Note also the Continuation Gap the week
before.
The Gap between March 7 and 9 on the Electric Auto-Lite chart (Fig. VI.12) also
proved to be an Exhaustion Gap but was not recognizable as such at the time it
formed. The volume on March 9 was certainly of climactic proportions but it must
be admitted that all the other signals were lacking and that this Gap appeared at first
to be a Break-away Gap. Fortunately, such extremely deceptive cases are rare.
Reviewing the Island Formation
It will be of advantage at this point in our study of Gap manifestations, to turn back
and review the discussion of the Island Reversal starting on page 168 in Study V. The
explanation of the strong reversal implications of the Island was based, it will be
recalled, on the rare conjunction of an Exhaustion Gap with a Break-Away Gap, the
first indicating an over-running of the previous technical trend and the second a
strong movement in a new trend. The first Gap is not always clearly signaled as an

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
Exhaustion, particularly where the Island takes several days to form, but the second
or Break-away removes any doubts. In the case of One-Day Islands, the clues to
Exhaustion are usually quite evident. Note, for example, the price action and cli-
mactic volume on the formation of the One-Day Islands in the Electric Bond and
Share chart (Fig. V.14). Remember to double the volume shown on the chart for Sat-
urday, August 17.
Gaps Forming Continuation Islands
In our study of Island Reversals, brief mention was made of another type of Island
pattern formed by Gaps occurring one above and the other below the price conges-
tion, instead of both Gaps forming at the same price level. Such a Continuation
Island appears in the 1936 chart of US Industrial Alcohol (Fig. VII.15) being formed
during the first part of May. The Gaps C and D make an Island of the Rectangular
price congestion between the 49 and 45 levels. We may classify D as a Break-away
Gap but, logically, both C and D are Continuation Gaps since, if all the price move-
ment between 49 and 45 occupied only a single day’s time, we should have only the
normal Continuation Gap picture. Another Continuation Gap appeared at E, and F
was an Exhaustion Gap followed by a pattern containing a number of Common
Gaps and a reversal of the previous downward trend. The volume on June 11 was
not conspicuous except as compared with the preceding week’s activity but a defi-
nite clue to the classification of this Gap (F), and to the change in the technical posi-
tion, was given by the failure of prices on June 12 to decline to compensate for the
amount of the dividend which the stock went ‘‘ex’’ on that day.
An Abnormal Island Reversal
Another very interesting formation appeared in this Industrial Alcohol chart in
early April, following the Gap at A. If we could have disregarded the price action on
April 7 which came down just far enough to close the A Gap, the second Gap at B
would have given us all the qualifications for an Island Reversal. The closing of the
first Gap destroyed this interpretation by strict application of the rules, yet the sub-
sequent price action certainly carried out the Island Reversal forecast. It is, perhaps,
only fair at this more advanced stage of our studies to state that such an action is not
unique by any means, and that a ‘‘broken’’ pattern of this sort does frequently
‘‘work’’, especially when the first Gap carries the earmarks of Exhaustion. Note the
climactic volume on April 2. The measuring implications of the preceding Flag for-
mation, which will be taken up in Study X, gave us another clue in this case.
Another type of formation appears occasionally which does not qualify strictly as
an Island Reversal pattern because the Gaps do not form at the same level, yet which

has otherwise all the appearance of an Island. The July bottom in Bethlehem Steel
shown on the chart in (Fig. IV.4) is an extreme example of such a formation. Others
appear in the C&O chart (Fig. IV.11) in November, and in the Pullman chart (Fig.
IV.13) in early December. These pseudo-Islands frequently ‘‘work’’ to a limited
extent but the beginner had better not attempt to trade on them unless other more
certain technical considerations lend them confirmation, and certainly never with-
out close ‘‘stop loss’’ protection. Some indication of the probable extent of the ensu-
ing move may be deduced from the relative levels at which the two Gaps form. This
point may be quickly studied if the student will draw a line across the chart through
the two Gaps in each of the examples cited and compare its slant with the following
price movement. Again, however, we must put in a word of caution against too
great a dependence on Islands which do not conform strictly to rule.
Limited Forecast of Islands Within Patterns
Another type of Island formation which the novice is often inclined to take too seri-
ously is a small Island developed after a very short preceding price movement, fre-
quently within the bounds of a large pattern. Such Islands have an extremely limited
forecast, roughly approximating the extent of the movement which led to them. This
limitation applies as well, of course, in the majority of cases to the typical Island
Reversals formed outside of previously established pattern levels, but in those cases
the ensuing movement is naturally of more profitable extent.
Examples of small Islands formed within congestion zones appear in the Wool-
worth chart, Fig. VII.14. The student, is, quite possibly, tired of looking at this chart
but we shall beg his indulgence and ask him to refer to it once more in this connec-
tion. The Gaps between the 4th and 5th and the 12th and 14th of September, with the
intervening price action, built an Island which reversed a minor rally and carried
prices back to the approximate level from which the rally started. Quick action on
this Island would have yielded at most a gross profit of less than two points, hardly
worth the risk and expense involved. Another example appeared in the action
between October 29 and 31; the decline of a point on the next day carried out the full
forecast to be expected from this One-Day Island. Still another Island appeared in
the last week of November; it should be noted that the subsequent decline was more
logically predicated on the reversal signal already given by the exhaustion of the
rapid advance to 71, than on this Island which could be taken only as reversing the
rally of about two points immediately preceding.
Gaps Which Defy Classification
Although the majority of Gaps which appear in the charts of active stocks may be

==================================================

STUDY VII
assigned, some at once and some after the lapse of only a few days, to one of the four
classes which we have analyzed in this study, there will be many Gaps which do not
comply with the rules and cannot be surely classified. Seldom if ever, however, do
such unidentifiable Gaps upset the general picture or lead to an incorrect interpre-
tation. Any Gap forecast must, as we have seen, be based on its relation to the whole
chart picture which precedes its formation. A Gap which has no apparent connec-
tion with, or basis in, the previous price action should be regarded with suspicion
only, and may be disregarded entirely as a forecasting factor (except as a possible
support or resistance point for which see Study IX later) if the subsequent price
action does not seem to give it any importance.
Gaps on Ex-dividend and Ex-rights Days
Mention was made in Study I (page 19) of the advisability of noting Ex-dividend
days on the charts. Theoretically, prices should decline by the amount of the divi-
dend on the first day that the stock sells on the Exchange without carrying the right
to receive a dividend previously declared. These days when the dividend ‘‘goes
off’’, or the stock goes ‘‘ex’’, are always indicated in the newspapers which publish
complete financial reports by their adding the symbol ‘‘x d’’ or some other recog-
nized notation after the name of the issue.
If the stock goes ex-dividend by an amount of, say, $2.00, the price range on the ‘‘x
d’’ day should, theoretically, fall two points below the range for the preceding day
on the chart. We should expect a Gap to appear in that case between the ‘‘x d’’ day
and the day before; especially if the stock is fluctuating at the time in a narrow range.
It is obvious that a Gap commensurate with the amount of the dividend, on such an
occasion, has no technical significance. If, however, the gap exceeds by an apprecia-
ble margin the amount of the dividend it does have a limited significance depend-
ing on that margin. If the chartist has difficulty in visualizing the effect of
ex-dividend action, he can make it plain on his chart by extending the price range
on the ‘‘x d’’ day upward by the amount of the dividend, using a dotted or a colored
line. This device helps in appraising the Gap action, if any.
Disregard Break-outs Caused by Ex-dividends
In practical charting, technical patterns are seldom thrown out of line by a stock’s
going ‘‘ex’’ a small dividend payment. Large regular dividends and year-end spe-
cials of unusual amount may occasionally ‘‘go off’’ when a stock is fluctuating
within a narrow pattern and the resulting ex-dividend drop or correction may, in
those cases, produce an apparent break-out or, at least, a movement which spoils the
pattern. Break-outs which are obviously the result of only a normal ex-dividend cor-

MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATE PATTERNS AND PHENOMENA
rection should, of course, be disregarded, and the subsequent price action watched
to determine the true technical trend.
The same considerations apply to the interpretation of Gaps and price action
occasioned by a stock’s going ‘‘ex-rights’’, except that the value of the rights is fre-
quently difficult to appraise with exactitude.
Summary of the Gap Study
Briefly summarized, we have learned that the Common Gap is the least significant
of the four recognizable types, forecasting at best only a return at an early date to the
normal price range. The Break-away type also has little significance beyond its
emphasis of a break-out from a technical pattern, and its suggestion of a rapid move-
ment to follow. The Continuation Gap, like the Break-away, is useful chiefly as
emphasizing the strength and rapidity of the price movement. In which it develops.
The most important of the four types is the Exhaustion Gap which, it may be hoped,
we shall be able to recognize in the majority of cases, not only by the extent of the
preceding movement but also by the usual accompaniment of high volume and the
immediately ensuing reversal indications.
In general, we have learned that Gaps must be analyzed with respect to the whole
preceding and accompanying chart picture. They should be regarded, at best, as of
secondary or confirmatory value.
Finally, they, like other technical phenomena and patterns, are not infallible. Gaps,
in particular, may be indefinite and misleading if an attempt is made at too hasty
analysis. Nevertheless, when viewed as minor indicators in conjunction with the
rest of the chart picture, they offer decided assistance in weighing all the technical
factors and arriving at a reasonable forecast of the future trend.
Gap Implications to be Studied Later
We have referred in passing to the support or resistance uses of Gaps which will be
taken up later in our general consideration of support and resistance levels in Study
IX. There is one other application of the phenomenon of Gap action to the forecast-
ing of price movement which will also be deferred to a later study. Certain theories
as to the measurement of the extent of price movements based on Gaps have been
advanced and are of considerable interest if not entirely dependable. These theories
will be fully discussed under the general subject of measuring formulas in Study X.
Before leaving the present discussion of Gaps, it should be added that some
chartists apply the various rules to occasions where no true Gap appears but where
the price ranges on two successive days simply fail to overlap, or where there is an
appreciable Gap between the closing price, considered by itself, of one day and the

next day’s price range. There is some logic for this, particularly in the latter case, but
it stands to reason that true Gaps, representing a greater and more plainly evident
departure from the normal, must carry greater weight in technical analysis. Where
the Gap action is not definite the usual Gap implications must be at least propor-
tionately discounted.

TREND LINE ACTION
We have completed in the preceding Studies our detailed examination of the var-
ious individual chart formations and phenomena which occur at intervals within
trends or at trend reversals. We are ready now to take up the broader aspects of price
trend and volume action. These subjects are, perhaps, less definite than our basic
forecasting patterns but they are none the less important, especially in the appraisal
of major cycles and major reversals. They lead to long-term vistas of the stock mar-
ket, but we shall see that this long-term point of view can be helpful constantly in
our trading operations on the immediate movements. The correlation of the broader
trend implications with the basic individual formations gives us a more complete
grasp of technical price action.
The Trend Line – Working Definition
The first of our general subjects for study is the trend line, a subject which is proba-
bly already somewhat familiar to the student since it was undoubtedly the first of
the technical manifestations of the market to be discovered, and much has already
been written about it. The fact that stocks, individually and as a whole, move in
fairly definite trends has long been recognized and studied by economists as well as
practical traders. The Dow Theory, which we shall discuss later, is based on general
trend action. The striking uniformity and definition of the major trends is one of the
first points noted in a superficial study of long-term charts, both of individual issues
and of the averages.
A trend line is a straight line drawn on the chart through or across the significant
limits of any price range to define the trend of market movement.
Trend lines may be of practically any length, defining a major, intermediate or
minor trend or the boundary of an area formation. The longer they extend the more
valuable and important they become in technical forecasting. They are usually
drawn across two or more tops or bottoms, but they are permissibly drawn slightly
inside the extremes of a few individual ranges if such construction extends them
through a greater number of tops or bottoms, as the case may be, in the general
trend. This slight deviation from the strict construction across extremities is permit-
ted because it is also true that the greater the number of extremes touched by the
trend line, the more dependable is that line.
Examples of Long-term Trend Lines
It will help us in arriving at a clearer and more complete definition of the trend line,

and how it is drawn, if we pause here to examine two samples of trend line action
in long-term charts. The monthly price range of the Dow-Jones Industrial Stocks
Average from 1924 through 1936 is shown in Fig. VIII.1. The monthly chart of Beth-
lehem Steel for the same period is reproduced in Fig. VIII.2. The solid diagonal lines
drawn on these charts are major trend lines; the dotted lines are secondary or sub-
sidiary trend lines which will be discussed later.
Undoubtedly, the most impressive feature in each of these monthly charts is the
extraordinary accuracy with which the trend line of
the 1929–1932 bear market (in each case, E-F)
The greater number of defines the upper limits of every intermediate rally
extremes touched by the within this major trend. Before we comment further
trend line, the more on these pictures, however, one point should be
dependable is that line. noted. The primary trend lines are drawn across
tops in downward trends, and across bottoms in
upward trends. The reason for this is that experi-
ence has shown such lines to be more important and more accurate than the lines
bounding the other sides of the trends. This rule may also be stated by saying that
primary trend lines are drawn along the right-hand limits of diagonal price trends.
The Theory of Trend Lines
The usefulness of trend lines depends on our basic theorem that a technical position,
or price movement, once established, will be continued until something happens to
change the technical situation. This, at first glance, may seem to offer little comfort,
for we know that a technical situation may change at any time. However, stocks do
move in trends, definitely, as a cursory glance at almost any chart will clearly show.
The more powerful the causes that produce a price movement, as evidenced by the
chart pictures, the more clearly defined the trend will be and the longer continued
and more profitable to the trader. Once a trend becomes fairly delineated the odds
strongly favor continuation.
In a general sense, therefore, trend lines are most serviceable in calling the chart
student’s attention to the main price trend. They are of little use during the process
of any area formation with little continued progress either up or down, but attain
their greatest importance when prices are pursuing a fairly regular upward or
downward movement. The most profitable trend lines, therefore, are those drawn at
an angle or, in other words, diagonally across the chart.
Practical Uses of Trend Lines
More specifically, trend lines are of great practical value in determining the proba-

TREND LINE ACTION
ble limits of intermediate declines and recoveries within established major trends,
or of minor rallies and reactions within established major trend, no matter how def-
inite, will almost always be subject to intermediate reversals but, so long as no major
reversal appears, the price movement tends to come back to the previously estab-
lished trend. And the same holds true for minor fluctuations within the intermedi-
ate trends. By outlining these trends, the trend lines give us our theoretical limits of
price swing, and aid us in forecasting the probable extreme objective of the next
reversal within any given trend.
Trend lines are also of great service, in the opposite or negative sense, when they
are broken. Trend lines must of necessity be broken some time since the stock mar-
ket never pursues a single direction forever. They are broken as soon as there is an
important reversal in technical movement, and they become valuable then in calling
our attention to such reversals while they are still in their incipient stage. We need
not curse trend lines, therefore, when they are broken, especially if they have already
proven long, dependable and profitable. Rather we should bless them for having
been thus profitable and for now notifying us that a change is probable.
So trend lines serve a double purpose. While they last they define the line of con-
tinuation in a movement, and when they are broken they serve notice of a probable
reversal and advise us to forget the old lines and start searching for new ones to
define the new trend.
Trial and Error Method in Establishing Lines
Trend lines are not, in themselves, a rose-strewn path to definite market forecast and
profit, however. They are fallible, just as are all the other chart phenomena we have
studied. And dependable trend lines are not always easy and quick to define. The
determination and use of trends is to a considerable extent a matter of good sense,
familiarity and experience. Moreover, the drawing, or placing, of trend lines is open
to considerable trial and error even on the part of the experienced professional.
No one can take a chart, immediately draw trend lines on it and be certain that
they are the proper, or even the best, trend lines that could have been inserted for
continuation of the current movement. That is just as impossible as is the absolutely
certain forecast of definite future prices by any finite individual.
On the contrary, the more experienced the chart student, the more humble will he
be in his current or previous view, the more ready and willing will he be to desert
his previously drawn trend lines and try another line, or another set of lines, if action
of the price chart indicates the wisdom of such revision.

STUDY VIII
Proper Angles for Trend Lines
In particular, there is much room for alteration of angles in a trend line. What looks
at first like a major movement may start out very sharply and steeply. The analyst is
quite justified in drawing the proper trend lines to define that original angle of
movement, but the experienced analyst will keep his mental reservation that the
angle of advance or decline is much steeper than usual for this stock and that the line
will probably have to be changed later on.
He will therefore know what degree of faith to place in the trend lines which are
called for by the movement thus far. If subsequent movements reduce the angle of
his first too-steep trend line, he will be more thankful than annoyed, for the more
natural angle gives greater promise of reliability and permanence.
On the other hand, the experienced analyst will know about how small an angle
it is safe to have in his particular stock without suggesting actual reversal. If the pre-
vious steep movement is leveled off a few times he draws his new trend lines gladly.
But if subsequent movements reduce the angle of the previous trend so far below the
usual or normal angle of trend, then he will begin to grow suspicious of that previ-
ous trend, and begin looking for signs of an important reversal in the opposite trend.
Practicing on the Chart
We may put to test the theoretical discussion of trend line drawing in the preceding
paragraphs, and gain a more practical idea of trend action, by analyzing Fig. VIII.3.
This chart shows the price and volume action of Baltimore and Ohio during the last
six months of 1935.
On July 22, following a formation which does not show in its entirety on this chart,
there was a break-out indicating a strong advance in this stock. The first minor set-
back after this break-out gave us our first two points (the bottoms on July 22 and 26)
across which to draw a trend line – the line indicated by A. This line, however, was
obviously too steep to last; it was broken on August 8 after which we had a new and
better line – B. This second trend was broken on August 27; the volume action on
this minor reaction (which will be discussed later on in this Study) indicated that the
up-trend had not yet been reversed. A third trend line – C – was now established,
which was not broken until September 20. The subsequent decline was reversed on
October 3; in the meantime, however, we had a down-trend line – D – established
across the tops on September 19 and September 30. Note that this line is drawn
across the outer peak on the 19th and not from the top of the movement on the 11th;
the down-trend did not start until the 19th.

A Tentative Long-term Line Appears
Following the reversal day on October 3, the price action built the semblance of an
Ascending Triangle with a break-out on the up-side on October 15 (note volume
action during this interval). We were now able to draw a trend line – E – across the
July and October bottoms. The slope of this line indicated that it might well define
an important and long-continued upward movement. Note that the down-trend line
D was broken by the same price action which signaled the break-out from the
Ascending Triangle on October 15.
This reversal in trend gave us again, in F-1, a first minor up-trend line which was
too steep to hold, but the second minor trend line, F-2, held to the end of this chart.
Before we leave this six-months chart to follow the subsequent action shown in
the next Figure, the student is requested to note for future reference the fact that the
first minor advance in August was not reversed until a third minor up-trend line (C)
had been drawn, and this third line was broken (on September 20) when the minor
trend had reversed. Note also that once the trend lines B and C were broken, the
ensuing rallies were unable to get back through them. This particular phenomenon
will be discussed under the subject of resistance in Study IX.
Following Through the Next Six Months
Look now to Fig. VIII.4 where the next six months of price and volume action in Bal-
timore and Ohio have been added to the six months we have just examined, giving
us now a full year’s chart of this stock from July 1, 1935 to June 27, 1936. On this chart
we have dropped the lines A, B, C, D, and F-1 which are no longer of any use to us,
but have continued the significant lines F-2 and E.
The first thing we notice is the continuation of the trend above the line F-2 for
nearly seven months. This line, which we drew across the bottoms on October 2 and
November 12, was barely pierced on December 28 but the closing on that day was
back above it. It was ‘‘ticked’’, or at least very closely approached, many times – on
December 19, January 21, March 13, 23 and 30. It was not definitely broken by a deci-
sive margin until April 21.
Patterns Appearing Within Trends
Here we may well interrupt our discussion of trend lines to consider for a moment
the other more familiar chart patterns which the student has doubtless already
noticed.
No clearly defined technical price formation appeared in the course of the F-2

STUDY VIII
trend until the end of January when a fair Ascending Triangle developed, with a
break-out on February 4 accompanied by notable volume, and was followed by a
fast mark-up to 241/4 on February 21. This rally was reversed by another Triangle
which broke down on March 9, and was followed by a quick decline to our trend
line. Again a Triangle formed with a break-out, on the up-side this time, on April 2,
which break-out also broke the minor down-trend line H. The ensuing advance was
comparatively weak, however.
The Right-angle Triangle which formed with high volume accompaniment at the
top in February was the largest and most significant looking formation yet to appear,
and indicated a decline of greater proportions than the reaction to the F-2 line. This
line was, in fact, broken late in April by a rapid drop in prices to 16, which broke also
our tentative long-term line E, giving us, in the meantime, a minor down-trend line
J, and a more important line I.
A New Long-term Trend Line Defined
The steep down-trend J was broken on May 5 and thereafter, with activity at a low
ebb, the price action built a long and rather loose Ascending Triangle approaching
an apex at the end of this chart, with its bottom boundary defined by the minor trend
line K.
Connecting the bottom on April 30 with the old October bottom now gave us a
new long-term trend line, G.
At this point the student is perhaps becoming a little impatient with our detailed
account of the trend line phenomena in the Baltimore and Ohio chart, and wishes to
get on to a more practical consideration of forecasting conclusions. With the
promise, however, that there are many helpful conclusions which will be drawn
when all the returns are in, let us draw a deep breath and study first another six
months of B & O chart history. Figure VIII.5 shows the price and volume action for
the full year of 1936, adding another six months to the last six months shown in Fig.
VIII.4.
Completing the Picture in Baltimore and Ohio
The first point of interest which the student will note upon comparing this new chart
with Fig. VIII.4 is the price action during the first two weeks of July. The Ascending
Triangle, calling for higher prices, which was in process of formation during June,
did not produce a normal break-out. Instead, prices slumped out of it near the apex
and declined nearly a point and a half, almost to the new long-term trend line G. Vol-
ume, however, was conspicuously absent on this abnormal move, giving us an
important clue; this was a ‘‘False Move’’ and a fairly typical example of this phe-

nomenon which will be discussed in detail in Study X.
Volume picked up during the second week of July and the price also advanced
rapidly, carrying out the Ascending Triangle forecast. The down-trend line I was
broken on July 14. Thereafter, the first minor up-trend line, L, was quickly broken; it
was obviously too steep to hold. A second line, M, was broken by the reaction on
August 21 and 22, which in turn gave us a third line, N. This third line was pierced
on October 1 but was not decisively broken until October 15. Here again, as in
August, 1935, the breaking of the third minor up-trend line signaled a reversal of
trend, and again the subsequent rally failed to get back through the trend line. By
the end of the year the price of B & O had fallen nearly to our last long-term trend
line, G.
Figure VIII.6 carries B & O on through November, 1937. The most interesting fea-
ture on this chart is the continuation of the long-term up-trend line G, to which the
price returned in June after the Spring decline of 1937, and which was finally deci-
sively broken (with a gap) on August 26. The continuation of the decline from that
point established a new major trend – a down-trend – and a new major trend line, S.
The student will notice various price patterns, besides those we have mentioned,
in this series of B & O charts covering over two years, and other trend lines of an
experimental, or at least very temporary nature. We have noted, however, every line
which an experienced chart analyst would consider as having significance at the
time it became defined.
The secondary trend lines, or parallels, drawn in dashes (see V, W, X, etc.) will be
discussed later in this study.
Trading on the Simple Primary Trend Line
The reader may possibly be more disappointed in the temporary and unreliable
quality of trend lines as exemplified in the Baltimore and Ohio charts than he is
impressed with their advantages. Yet, purely on a basis of a fair interpretation of the
trend lines, there were many opportunities for quick trades in this stock during the
eighteen months we have followed its action. If we were trading only on the long
side of the market, for example, we might have bought on July 24, 1935 at around
121/4 and sold on September 23, when line C had been broken, at around 16. We
would have bought again on October 15 at around 15 and sold on March 9, 1936 at
around 21. A third purchase was indicated on April 2 at around 21 and this trade
would have been closed out at a loss at around 191/2when the F-2 line was broken
on April 20. The next purchase was indicated on July 13, when line I was penetrated
and would have cost around 20; the next sale, on October 15 at around 25.
Note that three of these four trades showed a good profit and the fourth a small
loss-a very satisfactory average. Note also that, in making these trades, we did not

STUDY VIII
take fully into account the strength of the implications of the Right Angle Triangle
top in February-March, 1936 nor the Ascending Triangle in May-June. The former
should have deterred us from making the third trade which proved unprofitable,
and the latter would have put us into the fourth trade at around 181/2instead of 20,
increasing our gross profit by 11/2points.
Thus we see that, while the single trend line is not infallible, it offers very prof-
itable trading help, especially when it is considered in conjunction with any of our
previously studied formations and other chart phenomena that may appear.
The Double Trend Line or Trend Channel
We have considered so far only the single or primary trend line. The double trend
line is a set of two single trend lines bounding both the upper and lower limits of a
trend. One is the primary trend line we have already examined at some length in the
three Baltimore and Ohio charts; the other is a secondary line parallel to it, defining
the opposite limits. The double trend lines do not have to be exactly parallel but,
unless they are nearly so, they are of very little value in forecasting.
As might be expected, parallel trend lines are much less common than plain sin-
gle or primary lines, but when found they are much more reliable. And when they
appear in connection with long-term major movements, they provide outstanding
profit opportunities. A practiced glance at almost any stock chart will tell the expe-
rienced student whether there is a chance for parallel trend lines. As in the case of
single primary lines, some latitude is permissible in drawing them.
Establishing Parallel Trend Lines
Normally it takes at least three terminal range points to give us a basis for drawing
tentative parallel trend lines. Two points are required, of course, to define the pri-
mary line, and the opposite limit of price movement between these points gives us
the third point through which a secondary line may be drawn parallel to the primary
line. The more points available through which the parallel trend lines pass, of
course, the more reliable and important is the trend thus defined.
Established parallel trend lines form a trend channel within which the price action
fluctuates back and forth just as a stream meanders from side to side within the lim-
its of its valley floor. When the parallel lines define a major trend – when, in other
words, the trend channel is a wide one – the trader is able to reverse his position each
time the price approaches one of its trend limits and get worthwhile profits alter-
nately from the long and short side of the market, that is by alternately buying and
taking profits and then selling short and covering.

TREND LINE ACTION
Trial and Error in Establishing Parallel Lines
For practice in finding reliable parallel trend lines we may turn back again to Fig.
VIII.4. Our first opportunity to test the parallel line principle came when we drew
the tentative long-term primary line E across the July and October bottoms. Draw-
ing a line – the dotted line marked V – through the September top and parallel to E,
gave us a purely tentative trend channel. Both of these lines were broken by the next
intermediate movements and so had to be abandoned.
Another opportunity arose when the primary line F-2 was established. The sec-
ondary line W drawn parallel to F-2 across the top of
the intervening rally in the last week of October

subsequent price action. If, for example, the price of
B & O on February 19 had declined from instead of
rising through the V line, we should have been justified in believing that we had
established a dependable trend channel, and might have sold the stock in the expec-
tation of covering when it had continued in its decline to the neighborhood of line E
again. It is interesting to note that the advance through V was, in fact, quickly
reversed, but the line nevertheless had been violated and a new definition of the
major trend was required for conservative trading operations.
Playing the Major Trend
In the meantime, however, the parallel lines F-2 and W had formed a good trend
channel, but a relatively narrow one. We may use this as an illustration of an impor-
tant corollary to the general principle of trading on parallel trend lines. That corol-
lary is that it is much safer and much more profitable to play the intermediate
movements that run in the direction of the basic major trend, rather than the minor
corrections that run counter to it.
This same principle is also expressed in the old trader’s axiom, ‘‘In a bull market
use the dips for buying; in a bear market sell on the rallies’’. The point is that the
minor movements which run in the direction opposite to the general trend do not
carry as far in terms of points or dollars as those which run with the trend. The appli-
cation of this principle in trading practice depends, of course, on the narrowness of
the channel and the degree of slope of the trend. If the trend slants sharply, either up
or down, and the channel is narrow, the counter-trend or ‘‘correctional’’ movements

STUDY VIII
will offer little or no scope for profit. If, on the other hand, the channel is wide and
the trend slopes very gently, the counter-trend movements will run farther in terms
of points and may be turned to profit.
Relative Profits With and Against Major Trend
This point was brought up by our reference to the W-F-2 trend in the B & O chart,
but it is more clearly illustrated by the Industrial Rayon chart Fig. VIII.7. After the
‘‘April drop’’ in this stock in 1936, a bottom was made on June 6, and a top by the
ensuing rally on June 17. The next bottom gave us a trend line extending into the six
months pictured on our present illustration and indicated by A-1. The secondary
parallel line, A-2, was cut by the advance in September but, in the meantime,
another trend had been established, indicated by the lines B-1 and B-2.
Purchase of Industrial Rayon had been indicated early in June. Sale was indicated
by the application of the trend channel theory when the price approached the A-2
line on August 18, and re-purchase when the A-1 line was touched on August 21.
Now in the steeper B trend, however, note how little profit there would have been
in selling after the successive advances to the top of the trend channel; a sale, for
example, was indicated on October 6 at around 38 but the subsequent decline
extended only to 37, leaving practically no margin for profit on the ‘‘short side’’.
Obviously, the trader who bought Industrial Rayon in June was better off if he
stayed ‘‘long’’ of the stock through all of its minor fluctuations within the upward
trend until the line B-1 was broken (with a typical Break-away Gap) on November
23.
Incidentally, the student will note that the lines B-1 and B-2 are not exactly paral-
lel. However, they are nearly so, near enough to comply with the requirements made
for a valid trend channel, and they are perfectly defined by those tops and bottoms
from which they originate.
Trend Lines Help to ‘‘Let Profits Run’’
Such narrow and steep trend channels as the one we have just examined in Indus-
trial Rayon serve, therefore, a very useful purpose in keeping us ‘‘long’’ if the trend
be up, or ‘‘short’’ if the trend be down, until the intermediate trend is actually
reversed. The same purpose is, in fact, frequently served by single or primary trend
lines in those cases where it does not seem possible to establish a definite secondary
line or trend channel. Note, in this connection the trend line action on the Sears Roe-
buck chart for the last half of 1936, as pictured in Fig. VIII.8. The use of the single
trend line would certainly, in this case, have prevented us from taking profits pre-
maturely, had we owned the stock in July.

==================================================

TREND LINE ACTION
This point leads us into the consideration of a general principle of trading tactics,
the principle of cutting losses and letting profits run. The experienced trader knows
how important this is. The value of it may be less obvious to the beginner. We shall
discuss this principle later under the general subject of market tactics; in the mean-
time, suffice it to say that one of the most common mistakes made by the ‘‘green’’
trader is to let his losses run while he cuts his profits by grabbing a few points too
quickly.
In the matter of preventing premature commitments, trend lines are of even
greater use to the long-term trader or investor on the major cycles. Note, for exam-
ple how the major down-trend line E-F on the Bethlehem Steel chart shown in Fig.
VIII.2. would have warned against the purchase of this stock for a long-term posi-
tion until the line was decisively broken in August, 1932.
Trend Lines Often Give Early Reversal Signals
Another useful service frequently performed by trend lines is the forecasting of a
reversal, before the reversal signal is given by the completion of one of the technical
formations we have taken up in our earlier studies. This also is illustrated by the
Sears Roebuck chart (Fig. VIII.8). Note that the trend line suggested a reversal the
second week of December, permitting a sale in the 97–98 zone, whereas the Sym-
metrical Triangle which was in process of formation at the same time did not break
out until December 21 by which time the price had dropped to 92.
The Baltimore and Ohio chart (Fig. VIII.5) shows a similar situation in October
1936, when the trend line N was broken on October 15, while the large Rectangle for-
mation did not break out on the down side until October 22, a point and a half lower
down in price.
In other cases, a technical formation of sufficient size and strength to indicate an
important reversal may be completed and give us our trading signal before the trend
line is broken. A case in point is the Symmetrical Triangle top in February-March,
1936, on the B & O chart.
Horizontal Trading Areas
In our discussion so far of parallel trend lines or trend channels we have given all of
our attention to diagonal trends, slanting up or down. And we have seen that the
sharper the slope of the trend, the farther it departs from the horizontal, the less
profitable it is to trade both ways of the market within the trend channel. At the
opposite extreme we find occasionally well defined trend channels which are prac-
tically horizontal. If these channels are broad, affording several points of swing
between the top and bottom lines, they give profitable opportunities for taking alter-
– 283–

==================================================

STUDY VIII
nate long and short positions in the market. When these channels are narrow, the
opportunities are still there but the profits are more limited and greater agility is
required of the trader to capture them.
An example of a horizontal trend channel is shown in the chart of American Radi-
ator and Standard Sanitary for the last half of 1936, Fig. VIII.9. This channel is only
about two points wide; nevertheless, the student will see that it had potentialities for
profit for the nimble trader who grasped its implications promptly. The close rela-
tion between this picture and our old friend the Rectangle is, of course, easy to see.
The volume action within these parallel trends, however, does not as a rule show the
gradual but noticeable decline which we expect to accompany the formation of a
Rectangle. The resemblance to the Rectangle does not show up so plainly in the
wider and ‘‘looser’’ horizontal trend channels. Note, for example, the US Smelting
chart, Fig. VIII.9
The Trend Line as a Reversal Indicator
We have made frequent reference in this study of trend lines to the forecasting sig-
nificance of any price action which ‘‘breaks’’ them. When a trend line is first broken,
the question always arises as to whether or not a reversal of trend has been signaled.
Before we proceed to a thorough discussion of this admittedly troublesome ques-
tion, let us first consider what may be called a significant break.
To begin with it is obvious that the longer the line on our chart the greater the
chance of a slight error in the angle at which we draw it. The farther we extend the
line from the points which originally determined it, the more exaggerated becomes
any slight departure from the true trend. Consequently, the longer our line has run
from its origin the more critical we must be of any price action which apparently
breaks the line, and the more conservative in taking action on it. A point or two is
not important in appraising the price action of a stock in its long-term cyclical
trends, nor is a fraction of a point a decisive movement in several weeks of interme-
diate trend action. With this basic principle ever in mind, of allowing for probability
of error and for natural variations of no technical significance, we may turn our
attention to certain more specific rules.
What Constitutes a Significant Break
In general, we should follow the same rules in appraising the significance of a price
break through a trend line that we apply to a break-out from one of our familiar pat-
tern formations. In other words, we must take into consideration the extent of the
price movement, the closing price on the day the line is penetrated, and finally the
volume, although volume, as we shall see, is not a necessary accompaniment to a
decisive break in a trend line.

STUDY VIII
The first and most important consideration is the extent of the penetration. A price
movement which penetrates a well-established intermediate trend line by less than
a full point in a stock selling under 50, may have little or no technical significance
beyond occasioning later, perhaps, a slight correction in the drawing of the line
itself. In a stock selling between, say, 25 and 50 we should require a full point of pen-
etration, and proportionately greater penetration in stocks selling at higher levels. A
short minor trend, on the other hand, may be invalidated by a smaller penetration.
Along with the extent of price movement, the closing price level must be taken
into account. If the price ranges through a trend line on any given day but returns
and closes within the trend we are seldom warranted in considering the trend vio-
lated although such action is frequently followed shortly by a valid penetration. As
a rule we must look for the price to move through and close by a decisive margin
beyond the trend line before we may call the trend broken.
Volume Action on the Break of a Trend Line
Although an increase in activity often accompanies a decisive penetration of a trend
line, especially when the penetration is on the up-side, we cannot depend on it. The
most we can say is that increased volume accompanying a penetration emphasizes
the significance of that penetration. When the price breaks the trend and by the same
action breaks out of a pattern formation, the significance of the trend break is mea-
surably increased.
Gaps frequently appear when an important trend line is penetrated; such gaps are
Break-away Gaps with the same significance as those which appear at the break-out
from area formations, and may be construed as a decisive penetration.
The student may well review at this point our detailed analysis of the four Balti-
more and Ohio charts (Figs. VIII.3, VIII.4, VIII.5 and VIII.6) with special reference to
breaks which proved significant. Note also that there were several instances of inde-
cisive penetration which could be disregarded – the price action during the first
week of December, 1935, for example, and again on the 28th of that month. Another
good example of price action which could not be considered conclusive in extent
occurred in the first week of October, 1936.
Fanning Trend Lines and Flattening Trends
Having studied the qualifications for a decisive break of a trend line, we may now
revert to the broader question of the forecasting significance of such a break. The
most important question is always, ‘‘Has a reversal taken place? Are prices which
have been going up now going to go down, or are prices which have been in a

TREND LINE ACTION
declining trend now going to advance’’? There are, unfortunately, no simple and
sure tests we can apply to give us a quick answer. Trial and error, constant study, and
practical experience, bring eventually a high degree of ability in interpreting the
breaking of trend lines to the technical student. Trend line action is no more infalli-
ble than are our other technical formations and chart phenomena, but when the
whole chart picture is studied, there will usually be found many helpful guides to a
correct forecast.
The steepness of the trend is, as we have seen in our analysis of the Baltimore and
Ohio charts, frequently a reliable clue to the probability of a reversal. When a trend
starts out at a steep pitch we should expect it to be broken and corrected to a more
moderate angle before any actual reversal into a movement in the opposite direc-
tion. Such corrections in trend may be described as a fanning out of trend lines since
the successive lines spread out or diverge from their common point of origin as do
the ribs of a lady’s fan. As a rule – more often than not, that is – when this fanning
action occurs, the breaking of the third line signals a reversal of at least minor con-
sequence. We have seen two good examples of this in B & O – the first in August and
September, 1935, when A, B, and C were broken, and the second in the July–October
trend in 1936 when L, M and N were broken.
Flattening Trends Related to Rounding Turns
Another trend line action which is somewhat analogous to the fanning phenomenon
and which is also comparable to the formation we have studied previously under
the name of Common or Rounding Turn, is called the flattening trend. This action
might, in fact, be described as a very large, very gradual, and rather irregular
Rounding Turn (without, however, the characteristic volume action by which we
test the reliability of Rounding Turn price action). We may refer to the 1929–1932
weekly chart of Atlantic Refining (Fig. VIII.10) for an example of this phenomenon
of flattening trends. No detailed analysis or special comment is required to call our
attention to the evident imminence of a reversal as the trend approached the hori-
zontal in 1932.
Patterns Help in Interpretation of Trend Lines
The formation of a pattern of forecasting significance at the time a trend line is bro-
ken often aids greatly in determining whether the break signals an important rever-
sal or only a correction in trend angle. Naturally, of course, if we recognize such a
pattern as one of great technical importance we do not need the trend line action to
give us our reversal clue. Most reversals of major and intermediate trends are, in
fact, forecast by pattern formations or other individual phenomena which we stud-

ied, and often by both, as well as by the breaking of trend lines. The point for the stu-
dent to remember is to use all of his ‘‘tools’’ all the time, qualifying his pattern fore-
casts by the trend line action, and appraising the importance of trend phenomena in
the light of any patterns which may appear on his charts. Note how several familiar
patterns aided and confirmed our interpretation of the trend lines in the B & O
charts.
The Throw-back After Trend Breaks
In connection with the breaking of trend lines on reversals there is one very practi-
cal and helpful price action which occurs with sufficient frequency to warrant our
giving it at this point a careful study. We call this the ‘‘throw-back.’’ It is the strong
tendency of prices to return to the trend line shortly after they have broken through
it, a tendency manifested in, probably, as many as two out of three ordinary breaks
out of trend.
There are several good examples of the throw-back in the Baltimore and Ohio
charts. In Fig. VIII.3, for example, note the rally of prices in the first week of Sep-
tember to the trend line B which had been broken on
August 27, and the rally on September 23 to the C

level of the W line after it had been broken on the up-
side the preceding week. In Fig. VIII.5, a throw-back
appears on October 19 after the penetration of the N trend line. The student will find
other examples in these charts as well as in the other charts illustrating this Study,
and for that matter in almost any chart he may care to analyze.
Practical Use of the Throw-back
It is difficult to arrive at a logical explanation of the throw-back phenomenon, but its
practical application in trading is quite apparent. We cannot count on its occurring
after every penetration, unfortunately, and the throw-back does not always extend
all the way to the old trend line – it may touch the line, it may ‘‘bump’’ along it for
several days and rarely even penetrate it for a fraction of a point, or it may fail to
reach it by an appreciable margin.
Bearing all these chances and variations in mind, however, the experienced trader
may well try for such an obliging throw-back movement by taking only a portion of
his position when the first signal is given by the breaking of the trend line. But the
average beginner had best be sure of getting his trade made without taking a chance
on the stock’s kindly obliging him with a throw-back.

==================================================

STUDY VIII
It should be noted that a throw-back can seldom be expected when a Break-away
Gap appears as the trend line is broken.
Estimating Extent of Probable Move by Trend Lines
We have mentioned briefly at the beginning of this Study the usefulness of trend
lines in arriving at an estimate of the probable objective of any price movement aris-
ing out of an area formation. Now that we have inspected the trend line action in
several charts we may well give this very practical matter some further study. It is
an important point to be considered whenever we are called upon to decide whether
or not to trade on the implications of any continuation pattern, and especially when
we have to decide which of two or more such patterns on different charts offers the
greatest potential profit. It arises also in connection with reversal formations in
minor or intermediate trends.
As working examples, note how the price movement following the break-out
from the Right Angle Triangle top in March, 1936 in the B & O chart (Fig. VIII.4) was
halted at the F-2 line, and a minor correction required before a further decline car-
ried the price on down. Then note how the downward movement was finally
stopped in the neighborhood of the longer term line, E. Note also that the advance
in July out of the previous strong Ascending Triangle (Fig. VIII.5) was halted in the
neighborhood of the new long-term line, X, drawn parallel to G.
Trend Lines on Logarithmic Scale
Before leaving the subject of parallel trend lines it may be advisable to consider them
in relation to the type of scale used in plotting the chart. There are three principal
types of scales used for stock charts: the straight or arithmetic scale, the logarithmic
or ratio scale, and the square-root scale. Each has its advocates although the square-
root scale is least used and appears to have no important advantages. The reader is
probably familiar with the difference but, in short, the ratio or logarithmic scale
shows a smaller space vertically for each full point in price as the price moves
upward, giving equal space to equal percentage of movement. The distance from 10
to 20 on the ratio price scale, for example, is the same as the distance from 20 to 40,
and that again is the same as the distance from 40 to 80, and so on. The arithmetic
scale, on the other hand, allows equal spaces for each full point, no matter how high
or low the price may go. The arithmetic scale is the one we have used on all the
charts up to this point in this Course.
The square root scale may be described as a semi-ratio scale, coming between the
arithmetic and logarithmic types. For those who are mathematically minded, it may
be added that the trend line formed by a stock that advanced one full point in price

TREND LINE ACTION
each day over a given period would be a straight line on an arithmetic chart. On a
logarithmic chart the trend line would be a logarithmic curve, and on the square root
chart a true parabola, the former flattening out more rapidly than the latter.
The advantages claimed for the ratio scale are based chiefly on the fact that the
higher stocks go in price the wider the fluctuations tend to become, measured in
points of movements. The logarithmic scale is supposed to compensate for this ten-
dency by plotting actual distances on a percentage basis.
Logarithmic vs. Arithmetic Scale
In our experience, however, we have found that the arithmetic scale is easier to use,
and the distortion of patterns is much less than on the logarithmic scale. Ratio plot-
ting tends to compress the patterns at high price levels almost to insignificance, and
to exaggerate the patterns formed at low levels out of all proportion to their techni-
cal importance, making their correct interpretation extremely difficult.
As to trend lines, logarithmic charts, with one possible exception, do not ordinar-
ily give us straight lines which can be turned to profit in trading. The one possible
exception is the long-term bull market trend which tends to accelerate or curve
upward on an arithmetic chart. This phenomenon appears most plainly and consis-
tently on the monthly charts of the averages and certain of the more substantial lead-
ing stocks which follow the general market closely. Note, for example, the upward
acceleration of the 1924–1929 bull market trend on
the arithmetic monthly chart of the Dow-Jones

breaking in October, 1929, signalled the end of the
major movement. A similar straight line drawn
across the 1932 and 1933 bottoms on a logarithmic scale was broken in March, 1937.
On the other hand, logarithmic charts are of no assistance in major downtrends,
nor in either up or down intermediate trends. In brief, we believe that the average
trader need not trouble with logarithmic charts, unless he wishes, just as a matter of
general interest, to keep a weekly or monthly average chart on a logarithmic scale.
GENERAL REVIEW OF VOLUME
In all our studies of price patterns and phenomena so far we have discussed with
them the characteristic volume accompaniment, and the student has, we trust, come
to recognize the fact that volume is an extremely important part of the science of
technical analysis. It may not be absolutely correct to say that, ‘‘Volume is half the

picture’’, but this saying is helpful, nevertheless, in emphasizing the importance of
always considering bothprice action and volume in forecasting from our charts.
It is in order, therefore, to review the principles of volume action which we have
touched upon in our studies to date, and to bring them together into a brief general
survey.
Volume is the measure of buying and selling taking place in a given stock within
any stated period. Every transaction involves both a buyer and seller. One of them
is willing (or obliged) to buy the stock and the other to sell it at a certain price. As
prospective traders in that stock, it is our desire to interpret the transactions in terms
of their probable effect on the price trend. Generally speaking, we have no means of
knowing positively who is buying and who is selling, or why. We do not know from
the mere fact that a transaction or a certain number of transactions has taken place,
whether the buyers are smarter than the sellers, or vice versa. If, however, the vol-
ume of these transactions can be related to price movement, and can be compared
with the past history of volume in our stock, we are frequently able to deduce its sig-
nificance in the technical picture.
Past History Important in Study of Volume
The most important consideration, then, in the technical interpretation of volume is
its relation, first, to the volume habit for the preceding period, and, second, to the
price movement or lack of movement which accompanied it. In other words, it is not
the number of shares traded on a certain day that has significance but the compari-
son of that number with the number traded on the several days preceding and, to a
lesser degree, during the previous weeks and months. Before we can draw any help-
ful conclusions from the volume chart we must have a fair amount of back history
as a basis for comparison. In all our discussion of volume, therefore, it must be
understood that by high volume we mean volume greater than normal in the spe-
cific issue and at the time under consideration.
And, while we are stating general principles, it bears repeating that no technical
factor or phenomenon is infallible. This applies to volume as well as price.
Volume Characteristics Previously Discussed
In our previous Studies we have had occasion to make specific mention of volume
or relative activity in the following connections:
1. The general principle of high volumes at reversals in trend. This point requires
further analysis and considerable qualification in the light of our now more

STUDY VIII
advanced understanding of technical forecasting, and we shall discuss it far-
ther on in detail.
2. The characteristic decline of daily volume during the formation of area pat-
terns such as the Triangles, Flags and Rectangles, especially as these patterns
approach completion, and also during the formation of the rounding patterns
until they pass “dead center.”
3. The notable pick-up in volume which usually accompanies the break-out of
prices from an area pattern, or in certain cases follows within a day or two.
4. The high volume which signals the climax of a rapid movement out of an accel-
erating (or ‘‘drooping’’) price pattern.
5. The high volume which accompanies the formation of an Exhaustion Gap.
Volume as an Indication of Reversal
At this stage of our studies it will be evident to the reader that the volume phenom-
ena mentioned under 4 and 5 above are closely related. In each case we have a very
sharp mark-up or mark-down resulting in either an over-bought or over-sold con-
dition signaled by a conspicuous burst of volume. And these types of climactic or
exhaustion volume are apparently related to the more general condition of increased
volume at reversals. When we come to analyze the characteristic volume action on
reversals, however, we find that climactic or exhaustion volume plays a part but
only a part in the entire picture. We find also an interesting and frequently helpful
distinction between the typical volume action on top and bottom reversals.
Typical Volume Action on Reversals
The typical volume chart during a period of trend reversal shows two up-thrusts or
increases, the first of which accompanies the last strong movement in prices in the
old trend and the second the break-away into the new trend. The first is climax or
exhaustion activity, and the second is related to the volume increase which we have
already discussed in some detail as characteristic of break-out movements from
technical formations. Although the chart picture is not always clear, and although
there are many exceptions to the general rule, most charts of reversals will show,
when carefully analyzed, both climax and break-away volume, even when no very
definite technical area pattern or formation appears.
In the case of Head and Shoulders reversals in which the head extends only a
short distance beyond the level of the left shoulder, the climax volume usually
appears with the formation of the left shoulder, and a lesser climax or volume
upthrust attends the head. The break-away volume appears when, or very soon
after, the neck-base line is broken. When the head extends well beyond the left

shoulder level, the real climactic volume usually accompanies the drive that makes
the head. In the case of the Triangle reversals, the climax volume appears at the
beginning of the formation, on the last thrust of

thest extent in the old trend.
In the case of Rectangle reversals the volume
action is typically the same as in Triangles. With the Rounding and Complex rever-
sal patterns, however, the picture is slightly different. In the case of the typical
Rounding or Common Turn, the climax volume appears just before the price track
begins to flatten out, and the break-away volume appears after prices have started
to turn into the new trend. The volume chart on Complex reversals is usually rather
confused; in general, the volume action may resemble that on a Common Turn, or
that on a Head and Shoulders, or a combination of the two.
Differences in Volume Charts at Tops and Bottoms
The characteristic distinction between the volume action on tops and on bottoms
appears when we compare their relative climax and break-away volume. Speaking
very generally, for there are many exceptions, at a top the climax volume is greater
than the break-away volume, while at a bottom the break-away volume tends to run
higher than the climax volume. This difference is due, no doubt, to the same basic
factor which finds expression in the old street adage, ‘‘Prices can fall down but have
to be pushed up’’.
In addition to this usual, though not invariable, difference between top and bot-
tom volume patterns, there is also a tendency for the volume between the climax
peak and break-away peak to run duller at bottoms than at tops.
Volume Action at Temporary Halts in Trends
From our detailed examination of various charts and charts formations in previous
Studies, the student will probably have already discovered that the volume pattern
developed at intermediate halts in trends is much the same as that developed at
reversals. Since such halts do, as a rule, result in some slight retreat or correction,
they are comparable in a sense with reversals. In each case we have a stemming of
the technical tide which may show climactic volume action, and in each case, after a
more or less indeterminate price trend, we have a break-away which is usually
accompanied by break-out volume. The difference between the reversal volume pat-
tern and the intermediate congestion volume pattern is more a matter of degree than

STUDY VIII
kind. The important distinction between the two is found in the direction of price
movement on the break-out rather than in the volume action. The experienced tech-
nical trader, nevertheless, is able to develop a sense of volume which helps him to
arrive at a reasonable guess as to whether or not reversal or continuation is likely.
Declining Volume During Pattern Formation
Another characteristic of volume action which has been quite fully discussed in our
previous Studies, is the tendency for volume to decline during the period of forma-
tion of a technical area pattern. This shrinkage in activity is especially conspicuous,
as a rule, as the formation nears completion, just before a break-out occurs. Knowl-
edge of this rule is useful to the technical trader because it helps him to decide
whether or not a certain price pattern is classifiable as a dependable forecasting for-
mation. Where the price action presents a well-defined area picture the volume
action is confirmatory but not critical; where the price action presents a poorly
defined pattern, the volume action frequently ‘‘casts the deciding vote’’. It is a com-
mon error of beginners to see technical formations where none exist; the application
of the volume test to those situations will help them to avoid incorrect conclusions
and profitless trades.
Volume as an Indication of Continuation
We have, of course, in the common phenomenon of increased volume attending
break-outs from technical formations, one specific example of the use of the volume
chart in forecasting continuation. We have seen how a pick-up in volume almost
invariably accompanies a price break-out in an upward direction and usually, but
not always, accompanies a price break-out down-
ward. Where higher volume does not attend the ini-

pected. There is no need to discuss break-out vol-
ume further except to say that any conspicuous
increase in activity when prices move out of an area of congestion, regardless of its
pattern, is an indication of continuation. It should also be noted that an increase in
volume attending the penetration of a trend line has somewhat the same signifi-
cance as the increase attending a break-out from a pattern, and confirms the impor-
tance of the trend penetration.
And, once more, in this connection, let us recall the rule of doubling the actual vol-

ume of a Saturday’s trading in order to bring it into fair comparison for technical
purposes with the volume of trading on other days of the week.
Relation of Volume to Price Movement
There is another aspect of volume study which we have not mentioned heretofore,
the relation of volume to progress in price movement. This has been the subject of
considerable research, with rather disappointing results in so far as our being able
to discover any dependable trading rules. The most that can be said is that, so long
as prices continue to move in apparent proportion to the volume of activity, the fore-
cast is continuation. When, however, several days of high volume are attended by
no price movement the suggestion is that important resistance has been encoun-
tered, and that some correctional movement will follow. This general principle is
subject to much leeway in its application to specific situations, and judgment must
be used in appraising its importance with relation to other factors appearing on the
same chart.
Relation of Volume Action to Basic Trend
Finally, there is one more general rule of volume action which is often of use to the
technical trader when other elements of the chart picture fail to give a definite clue.
This rule may be expressed in simple terms as follows: volume tends to run higher
when prices are moving in the direction of the basic trend, and lower when prices
are moving contrary to the basic trend. It should be noted that this rule holds true in
only a general sense; it should not be applied to a single day’s volume action for
there are frequent exceptions. Taking into account the chart picture for a reasonable
period, however, it works out with a high degree of dependability.
Good examples are plentiful – will be found, in fact, in almost any chart which we
may care to examine. The student will recall that we made use of this rule in our
analysis of the Inverted Triangle which formed at the 1929 top in General American
Transportation (Fig V.1) and again in the analysis of
the Ascending Triangle in Anaconda Copper (Fig.
VI.4). It comes into play in the analysis of the Out-of- Volume tends to run

STUDY VIII
Most Useful in Intermediate Trend Trading
This general rule which we are discussing applies also to the broad pictures of major
or cyclical trends presented by weekly charts, but is of little practical use in long
term trading since too great a time must always elapse before the volume relation
becomes clearly developed. It is, however, of great practical value in trading on the
intermediate movements, both in the continuation and reversal phases of those
movements.
Specifically, it is most useful in deciding whether a reaction in an upward trend is
the beginning of a reversal into a downward trend, or simply a minor fluctuation
which will soon run out and be followed by a resumption of the upward movement.
Or, in a downward trend, whether a rally is initiating a reversal or simply correcting
a temporarily over sold condition.
The student will understand that this rule is merely one more tool in the kit. By
itself it is of limited usefulness, but considered in connection with all of our other
technical guides – patterns, gaps, trend lines, etc. – it helps us in arriving at a rea-
sonable forecast of the future price action.
THE DOW THEORY
This is a good place in our studies to give some brief attention to the Dow Theory
since that theory is based primarily on general trend and volume considerations,
with practically no reference to the many specific formations and phenomena which
we have been studying in this Course.1
It is noteworthy that Charles H Dow, the man who first set forth the principles
which have been developed into what is now known as the Dow Theory, applied
these principles himself only to the ‘‘averages’’ and apparently only, or at least
chiefly, as a means of judging the basic business and financial trends, rather than as
an aid to speculation. His followers have been more attentive to the speculative
application of the principles, and the public at large has come to conceive of the Dow
Theory as a complete guide to successful stock trading which is very far from the
fact as well as from the original purpose of its author.
1. For further information on the highly respected tenets and practical applications of the Dow Theory’s
well-grounded usage for market analytics, plus the several profit-proved improvements to it by Samuel
Moment, the next work in this Series of Market Classics is recommended; ‘‘New Blueprints for Gains in
Stocks and Grains’’ combined with ‘‘One-Way Formula’’, both by William Dunnigan.

==================================================

TREND LINE ACTION
The Two Averages Used by Dow
The Dow Theory depends upon the simultaneous study and interpretation of two
averages – the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (of which a long-term chart is shown
in the Frontispiece of this Course) and the Dow-Jones Railroad Average. In the days
when Mr Dow first promulgated his basic principles of market action, the railroads
collectively constituted an extremely important part of the American financial pic-
ture. The capital invested in railroads represented a very large share of the corporate
wealth of the country. Moreover, virtually every movement of goods, whether raw
materials or finished products, went by rail. Consequently, every change in business
activity was reflected promptly and directly in railroad income. This condition,
which no longer maintains, accounts for the great importance which Mr Dow
attached to the movements of the Rail Average. Many present-day students of the
averages now discount the importance of the Rails. Certainly the movements of the
railroad averages have been difficult to apply in the Dow Theory, and frequently
downright misleading, in the interpretation of the market as a whole since 1932.
The Major Tenets of the Dow Theory
The leading contemporary exponent of the Dow Theory is, without doubt, Mr
Robert Rhea, from whose work ‘‘The Dow Theory’’ the following brief summary of
six of the principal tenets of the theory are quoted.
1. Dow’s three movements: ‘‘There are three movements of the averages, all of which
may be in progress at one and the same time. The first, and most important, is the
primary trend; the broad upward or downward movements known as bull or bear
markets, which may be of several years’ duration. The second, and most deceptive
movement, is the secondary reaction: an important decline in a primary bull market
or a rally in a primary bear market. These reactions usually last from three weeks to
as many months. The third, and usually unimportant, movement is the daily fluc-
tuation.”
2. Both averages must confirm: ‘‘The movements of both the railroad and indus-
trial stock averages should always be considered together. The movement of one
price average must be confirmed by the other before reliable inferences may be
drawn. Conclusions based upon the movement of one average, unconfirmed by the
other, are almost certain to prove misleading.”
3. Determining the trend: ‘‘Successive rallies penetrating preceding high points,
with ensuing declines terminating above preceding low points, offer a bullish indi-
cation. Conversely, failure of the rallies to penetrate previous high points, with ensu-
– 299–

==================================================

STUDY VIII
ing declines carrying below former low points, is bearish. Inferences so drawn are
useful in appraising secondary reactions and are of major importance in forecasting
the resumption, continuation, or change of the primary trend. For the purpose of
this discussion, a rally or a decline is defined as one or more daily movements result-
ing in a net reversal of direction exceeding three per cent of the price of either aver-
age. Such movements have but little authority unless confirmed in direction by both
averages, but the confirmation need not occur on the same day.”
4. Lines: ‘‘A ‘line’ is a price movement extending two to three weeks or longer,
during which period the price variation of both averages moves within a range of
approximately five per cent. Such a movement indicates either accumulation or dis-
tribution. Simultaneous advances above the limits of the ‘line’ indicate accumula-
tion and predict higher prices; conversely, simultaneous declines below the ‘line’
imply distribution and lower prices are sure to follow. Conclusions drawn from the
movement of one average, not confirmed by the other, generally prove to be incor-
rect.”
5. The Relation of volume to price movements: ‘‘A market which has been over-
bought becomes dull on rallies and develops activity on declines; conversely, when
a market is oversold, the tendency is to become dull on declines and active on ral-
lies. Bull markets terminate in a period of excessive activity and begin with com-
paratively light transactions.”
6. Individual stocks: ‘‘All active and well distributed stocks of great American cor-
porations generally rally and decline with the averages, but any individual stock
may reflect conditions not applicable to the average price of any diversified list of
stocks.”
Application to Stock Trading
The student who wishes to investigate the Dow Theory at length will find all of its
principles fully expounded in the works of Mr Robert Rhea. As a broad, basic study
of the general market trend it is of unquestioned authority, but as an aid to success-
ful trading in individual stocks our experience indicates that it is of extremely lim-
ited value. One cannot buy or sell the ‘‘average’’, and individual stocks do not make
their tops or bottoms at the same time as the averages, nor move at the same rate.
More often than not, by the time a ‘‘signal’’ has been given by the averages impor-
tant profits or opportunities for profit have been lost.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
In our last Study we learned that one of the uses of trend lines is in estimating the
probable objective of an intermediate price movement. The existence of a well
defined trend, suggesting that any movement of prices will be turned back as it
reaches the trend line, gives us a basis for measuring the probable immediate prof-
its to be gained in a prospective trade, and for comparing the potential profits in one
stock with another. This restrictive action of trend lines may be called a phenome-
non of resistance – one of the many which the technical trader finds it profitable to
know and put to use. The general subject of support and resistance levels is one of
the most interesting, and most practical as well, of our Course in Technical Analy-
sis. We shall devote the greater part of this Section to it.
The Importance of Reversal Levels
We gave our first attention in this Course to the various formations or patterns
which forecast a reversal of price trend. Most certainly, indications of reversals are
of prime importance in practical trading, because we may assume continuation of
the previous or current trend until signs of reversal appear. Reversals are our signals
that the technical position is undergoing change and that it is necessary to take
action, to adjust our trading policy to the changing technical trend or forecast.
If we can get advance information by some means or other, regarding the proba-
ble point at which a reversal of the trend may occur, we have a great advantage in
planning our practical market operations. We shall be forewarned, if we decide to
take a position in a certain stock, to scrutinize with particular care its action as
depicted on the chart when it approaches that point or level. And we shall be pre-
pared all the more quickly to accept and act upon any evidences of reversal that
show up there. So, any information as to the levels at which strong resistance to fur-
ther movement may be expected is of practical help, first, in determining whether or
not it will be profitable to take a position in a stock, and, second, in determining
when it may be wise to take profits.
Deciding Upon Our Terminology
Resistance levels, generally speaking, are those price ranges at or within which
increased offers (or bids) are met, resulting in a stemming of the technical tide, and
either a reversal of trend or, at least, a temporary halt and ‘‘congestion’’. It will make
our study easier, however, if we abandon the broad use of the term ‘‘resistance’’, con-
fining its application to those levels at which upwardor advancing price movements
– 303–

==================================================

STUDY IX
are halted, and use instead the term ‘‘support’’ to describe those levels where down-
wardor declining trends are arrested.
A resistance level, then, is an approximate level, or fairly well defined price range,
where a previously advancing stock meets resistance in the form of strong selling. A
support level is an approximate level or price range where a preceding decline
meets support. In the form of strong buying. A resistance level may, therefore, be
called also a ‘‘supply area’’ – an area, that is, in which an increased supply of the
stock for sale is encountered. And, by the same token, a support level may be called
a ‘‘demand area.”
Methods of Forecasting Resistance Levels
We have seen in our previously mentioned trend line action one method of fore-
casting probable support and resistance points. There are, in fact, a great many
nearby and temporary supports and resistances set up by the various patterns of
price action which we have studied in the preceding sections of this Course, and we
shall take these all up later in the course of this Study. First and foremost among
support and resistance levels in practical trading importance, however, are those
which occur at price ranges which have been marked and identified by the appear-
ance of area formations or price congestions at those same ranges at some preceding
period in the trading history of the stock. Such future developments of support and
resistance are, obviously, the repetition, at a later date, of support or resistance pre-
viously manifested at the same levels, since we know that any price congestion or
formation, whether reversal or continuation, reflects in itself some measure of sup-
port or resistance.
Resistance Levels Become Future Support Levels
It is important to note at this point, however, that an area formation built by resis-
tance will, if later penetrated, manifest itself as a support level. And, in the same
manner, a support level will, when broken through, show up as a resistance point in
future price movement. Each may repeat in its original role but more often they
exchange roles. In other words, an area formation, whether originally one of resis-
tance or support, may repeat later on in the same or the opposite position, tending
to check whatever movement happens to approach its level from either above or
below.
Logical Explanation for Reversal Levels
Any logical explanation for support and resistance levels must take into account

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
various natural as well as artificial causes. One natural explanation lies in the fact
that the public, and all trading elements, tend to remember previous area levels and
thus make them important. While a stock is changing its price level rapidly, day after
day, the public will be buying and selling at widely divergent levels and there will
be no unanimity, or strong memory impression, in such changing prices.
But if the stock has formed an area, has held within a fairly narrow range for some
time, then public purchases and sales tend to bunch up on that range and the pub-
lic remembers that particular price level. The longer the time which the stock spent
in that range, therefore, and the greater the total vol-
ume of transactions which took place therein, the

ticular price range for it to become significant. But if
the stock now meets resistance and fluctuates for a
month between 95 and 100, then the public will be much more likely to remember
that particular price range in connection with that stock and to be governed thereby
at a later date. And, obviously, this range will have been especially impressed on the
many who bought or sold within it.
Now suppose that the stock again advances on up in a fairly straight and rapid
movement and then forms another long area range around 125. The 125 range now
assumes much greater importance than any of the prices between 100 and 125. At
those two levels, at 100 and at 125, we have now had formed area formations and
thus resistance or support points.
The Memory Factor Comes into Play
Let the stock whose theoretical movements we followed in the preceding para-
graphs now begin to react from 125 back toward 100. There will not be nearly as
much public interest in its successively declining price levels on the way down as
there will be when the price again strikes that previous area range at around 100.
When that price is reached, however, people will begin to buy who recall seeing the
price there before and who, meanwhile, have wished they had bought at that earlier
level. Now they see a second opportunity to buy there and many of them do.
Or there may be many traders who went short of the stock the first time it hesi-
tated at 100, who foolishly failed to protect themselves with stop-loss orders, and
who worried about their paper losses while the stock went up to 125, and are now
glad to be able to cover their short sales by repurchase without loss, as the stock gets
back again to the 100 level. Thus from various natural tendencies, there is built up

==================================================

STUDY IX
greater buying or demand which becomes technical support at the 100 level, which
was formerly a resistance point.
If we assume that this support level around 100 reverses the price trend once
more, then the stock will meet resistance to further advance when it again
approaches that former resistance level of around 125. At that level, many who
wished they had sold out the first time the stock hit 125 and before it started back
down to 100, now find they have a second opportunity to sell at 125 and do so. Short
traders, who, while the stock was going down to 100, wished they had sold short at
the 125 level, now find that they, too, have another opportunity to sell short at that
price. Thus there is clear logic to the importance of resistance and support levels,
simply from rather natural considerations.
Artificial Factors Also Occasionally Effective
Other reasons may be found, however, in a consideration of more artificial move-
ments, such as may be produced by the plans of professional operators. Inside
groups work not only with such natural ideas in view as those we have just noted,
but they also have usually very definite ideas of the price levels at which they wish
to accumulate most of their stock and where they wish to distribute it. Such a cam-
paign assumes advance formulation of a definite and organized plan to buy a large
block of stock at around a certain price level and sell it around another price level.
If the operators buy most of their line of stock around 100 and decide to sell it out
at around 125 they are hardly likely to sell it all the first time the stock hits 125. It is
more likely that they will be able to sell perhaps only two-thirds of their holdings the
first time the price reaches that goal. Exhausting the buying power at 125, tem-
porarily, they will let the stock drift lower of its own accord, unless it is weaker than
they thought and gets within striking distance of 100 again. In that case their best
procedure might well be to buy back some of the stock they sold at 125, thus check
the decline at 100, and start the issue back up again. But when the new advance
approaches 125 once more, they will begin to sell the rest of their holdings, in accor-
dance with the original plan of buying around 100 and selling around 125.
Thus we see how support and resistance levels, once established, may well con-
tinue to exercise important and dependable influence on future movements.
Degree of Reliability of Supply and Demand Levels
In any case, we shall find that such support and resistance levels are quite reliable.
Once more, they are not infallible, as we know, but they are probably more impor-
tant and more reliable than the average of the various patterns and rules which we
have been studying. Sometimes the probable levels of resistance or support forecast

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
by the back history do not hold but they are still valuable for the chart student. They
may hold only temporarily but as soon as it is fairly established that the previously
noted levels are not holding, then they become useful in a negative way at least,
because they attest to the decisive force of the current movement, label it as a strong
and powerful one, and suggest most emphatically that the movement will then con-
tinue on until it meets the next probable level of resistance or support.
Quite naturally, the question of how long old support or resistance levels remain
effective, enters into any appraisal of their dependability in practical trading. Before
we discuss this point, however, it will make our study easier if we first analyze some
examples of support and resistance action as it is manifested in major trends.
Old Bottoms Become Future Tops
For an almost perfect exemplification of the general principle that support levels
once penetrated become resistance points in future advances, and vice-versa, the
student may refer to the monthly chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Fig.
VIII.1. Let us follow first the long bull market action from 1924 to 1929 and note the
levels at which resistance was encountered. The first such level showed up at
120–124 where the advance was halted for five months. The next appeared in the
160–164 range (each line represents four points on this chart) where prices struggled
for over a year before again pushing upward. Resistance that took six months to
break, developed again at the 200 level. There was a little difficulty getting through
216–220, and then an almost ‘‘vertical’’ advance to 320–324 where five months’
resistance was encountered before the final drive pushed through to the 1929 top.
Now follow the price action during the great 29–32 bear market. The first panic
collapse took prices down in two months to 212 and then to 196, meeting support
and rallying from a zone that had formerly manifested itself as a resistance level,
and which we noted as such in the preceding paragraph. The catastrophic nature of
the 1929 collapse is indicated by the ease with which it smashed through the sup-
port level which we should have expected normally to develop around 320.
After this first panic drive, however, a more normal sequence of swings appeared.
The rally from 196 was a strong one, taking the average price back up again to 296
in April, 1930. Note that the resistance point here was at the same general level as
the support under the first six months of price action during 1929. In other words,
an old bottom here became a new top.
And Old Tops Become New Bottoms
The next decline in the bear market was halted briefly around 216, encountering
support where resistance had formerly appeared in early 1928 advance. An old top

STUDY IX
had become a new bottom. The next sharp decline met support around 160, a level
the importance of which had been demonstrated by the chart from October, 1925 to
March, 1927. Here again an old resistance level manifested itself later as a support
level. The rally in early 1931 met resistance and was turned back at 196, at the same
level where the first 1929 panic decline had met support. The ensuing drop was
stopped at 120, now appearing as a support level whereas it had been a resistance
level in late 1924 – early 1925.
The action of prices through the first stages of the bull market that started in 1932
is not so directly comparable in its early stages, but it will be noted that the first
advance was reversed in the general level of the last bear market congestion. Also
the 160 level which appeared first as resistance in 1925–1927, then as support in
1930, and then as resistance in 1931, appeared again as a resistance point in April,
1936. The decline in June 1931 met support at 120 and rally in November met resis-
tance at the same 120 level. The top of the September, 1932 advance furnished sup-
port throughout 1933 and 1934.
Value of Weekly Charts in Forecasting
The student of the market cannot fail to be impressed by the extraordinary influence
exerted by these old tops and bottoms even after a lapse of months and years. Their
importance in forecasting the probable nearby objectives of current movements is
plain to see, even from our quick survey of the twelve years’ action of the Dow-Jones
Industrial Average. In applying this support and resistance study to individual
issues however, the weekly charts give more exact and detailed information than the
monthly charts. They show much more plainly the levels at which congestions of
significant duration appeared and the levels through which prices moved rapidly
without developing support or resistance patterns. The weekly charts also picture
the volume at different price levels, a factor which becomes useful in determining
the probable future importance of such levels.
The weekly chart of almost any actively traded issue will show, when carefully
analyzed, a number of good examples of the influ-
ence of old support and resistance levels on later

Volume a Factor in Estimating Future Influence
Dropping precipitately from its top around 400, the price of General Electric fell in
November, 1929 to 168. These prices were equivalent to 100 and 42 respectively in
terms of the stock after it was split, and 42 thus became a level to be noted for future
reference. The ensuing ‘‘post-panic’’ recovery carried the price up to 64–65 where
two months’ resistance was encountered, with a reaction back to 54–55, before the
advance was continued. The next drive met resistance for a month and a half at
about 78–79, then pushed on and was finally reversed around 94–96. Now starting
down, a first sharp drop penetrated the 78–79 level (a distinctly bearish perfor-
mance) but met support around 74; the high volume registered on this movement
(last week of April and first week of May, 1930) suggested that this support level
would have great future significance. Incidentally, in studying the volume depicted
on this chart, bear in mind that the volume before the 4-for-1 split should be multi-
plied by four to bring it into fair comparison with the subsequent volume.
The next mark-down in the bear market met support in the 64–65 zone which had
been a resistance zone in late 1929. A recovery now encountered resistance in the 74
zone, a level which we have noted previously as likely to be important. The three
months price action between 64–65 and 74, approximately, gave these levels further
emphasis for future consideration.
Levels Established During the Bear Market
Without going into tedious detail we may now follow the price action of General
Electric on down through the bear market to the 1932 bottom and note briefly the
levels at which support and resistance appeared.
Support appeared around 46–47 in November, and at 42 in December, 1930, the
latter having been noted as a support level in 1929. Next, we met resistance around
54 (cf. December, 1929), support around 36, resistance near 46, and then what
appeared to be important support, volume considered, around 24–25. The subse-
quent recovery, however, fell short of 36 where we might have expected it to reach
(cf. June, 1931) and was reversed around 34–35. The next support level appeared
around 18, and 24 appeared as we might have anticipated as a resistance point in
February, 1932.
Before we leave this chart it is suggested that the student review the foregoing
analysis and note how the dotted lines are drawn on the chart to define the appar-
ently significant boundaries of the price movements and congestions. A sort of an
optical method of averaging is employed in arriving at these levels, having in mind
that later price movements may either slightly penetrate or not quite reach lines set

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
too exactly. Study also the volume, because it is logical, obviously, to suppose that
the greater the aggregate volume attending the establishment of a support or resis-
tance level, the longer that level is likely to have effect on future price action.
Levels Repeating in the Opposite Trend
Having defined the price levels or zones which appeared to be important in our sup-
port and resistance study during the bear market in General Electric, we may now
test their actual effect on the progress of prices in the opposite trend. Turn to Fig. IX.2
which traces the trading history from July, 1932 through December, 1936, showing
the weekly high and low price range and volume. On this chart the levels marked
on the preceding chart have been extended by means of dotted lines to facilitate our
study of their continuing influence.
We note first that the 18 level was penetrated by the first sharp rally, although we
might have expected resistance there; Nevertheless, following along through 1933
and 1934, this level did have continued significance, briefly as resistance in Novem-
ber, 1932, and afterwards as support for many reactions.
Excepting for the sharp penetration in the summer of 1933, the 24–25 level, which
we marked down in 1931 as likely to be important, became a wall of resistance that
was not finally breached until June, 1935. The 42 level which first appeared as sup-
port for the panic drop in 1929, demonstrated its importance in 1936 where it became
a resistance and an intermediate reversal point. In fact, the effect of this began to
show up at 41 in November, 1935. The apparent influence of the next three old sup-
port and resistance levels above 42 is shown even more plainly on the daily chart of
General Electric for the last half of 1936, Fig. IX.3.
Forecasting the Next Steps in General Electric
We have seen in the foregoing study how long old levels of support and resistance
may retain their potency in subsequent markets. And, we have had some note-
worthy examples of old support levels or bottoms becoming resistance points or
tops in later movements when prices approach these levels from below. Studying
the back history in General Electric we might logically forecast, as this is written,
that the stock would meet resistance to further advance around 54–55 (cf. Decem-
ber, 1929 and February, 1931) and that once this level was passed, there would be a
fairly free movement to around 64–65 (cf. June-August, 1930).
Resistance and Support Levels in Intermediate Trends
Up to this point in our study we have been concentrating on the major support and

STUDY IX
resistance zones depicted on the long-range charts and defined in general by the lim-
its of the intermediate price movements. Naturally these are the most important lev-
els for the technical trader to determine in advance if possible, and we have seen
how, in general, they are most readily forecast from the past trading history shown
on weekly charts. We have seen also that these levels cannot be set exactly by any
mathematical process, and that a certain amount of judgment, and optical appraisal
of the price and volume action, is required to estimate their future potency. Despite
this lack of absolute precision, however, it is quite obvious that important support
and resistance levels, or demand and supply areas, can be very closely approxi-
mated.
If we turn now to a study of the minor fluctuations within an intermediate price
trend we find that exactly the same phenomena of support and resistance are man-
ifested therein that we found in major trends. These minor fluctuations cannot be
seen on weekly charts but may be found on the daily chart of almost any stock in an
active movement. A number of good support examples appear in the chart of Snider
Packing, Fig. IX.4.
Minor Tops Later Become Minor Bottoms
Snider Packing in July and August, 1935 encountered resistance to price advance at
the 19 level, which was finally broken through on August 29 (note the volume). The
ensuing rally ‘‘made a top’’ around 21 and the price then re-acted to 19, meeting sup-
port at that former resistance level. After advancing from there to around 231/2, the
next reaction was stopped at around 21; again a previous top had become a new
minor bottom. And so on – each minor reaction was supported and reversed at the
approximate level of a previous minor top, with only one exception, that exception
being the decline on October 22 which did not carry all the way down to the pre-
ceding top at 241/2.
When an intermediate reversal appeared in November the first sharp drop was
halted at the approximate level of the late October minor top, and the next drop
encountered support in the neighborhood of the top level made on relatively high
volume the last week of September.
Negative Usefulness of Minor Support Levels
The technical trader quickly develops a practical sense of what levels are most likely
to afford support or resistance, as the case may be, to future price movements. Nat-
urally, such manifestations of minor supports as were shown in the August to
November advance in Snider Packing, are of importance to the intermediate trend
trader only when they are broken. Reactions to the levels of preceding tops in an

STUDY IX
intermediate advance are a normal expectation and do not carry any unfavorable
implication. The breaking of what should be a good support level for a minor reac-
tion, however, suggests a more important change in the technical picture and the
strong possibility of an intermediate reversal of trend.
The student may find many good examples of minor support and resistance in the
charts illustrating our previous studies in this Course. The levels are clearly defined
in the Mack Trucks chart (Fig. V.9) and the Electric Boat chart (Fig. VI.1); also in both
trends on the Columbian Carbon chart (Fig. VI.17).
Resistances Set Up by Patterns and Trend Lines
We have learned the importance in technical forecasting of support and resistance
levels established in previous trading history, and we have observed how such lev-
els may function interchangeably as either resistance or support depending on the
direction from which prices approach them. We have noted in our preliminary dis-
cussion of resistance that there are various possible reasons for this repetitive action,
including the factor of memory. Once established these levels do not change with the
passage of time although they may eventually lose their effectiveness; in other
words, the resistance at a certain level may become exhausted and disappear but it
does not change its level. And we have noticed how long they last, especially if
made originally on high volume.
Now, however, we come to a different type of resistance which does not arise from
previous manifestations of support or resistance, repeating always at the same gen-
eral level, but which is created instead by a price trend or pattern or one of our well-
defined area formations. The support or resistance so created may be encountered
at different levels depending on the time element; this week it may be expected at a
certain price level but next week it will be met at a higher or a lower level. In other
words, the line of support or resistance to price movement set up by many trend and
area patterns is a diagonal rather than a horizontal line.
Trend Lines Defining Support and Resistance
In Study VIII we discussed the tendency of prices to move in waves within fairly
regular trends which frequently can be defined with
great precision by a single trend line, and occasion-

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
level tending to halt and reverse price declines whenever they approach it. In a
downward price movement the primary trend line is drawn across the tops of suc-
cessive rallies and becomes a moving resistance level. Where the trend channel is
sufficiently regular to permit the construction of parallel trend lines, the upper line
functions as a moving resistance level and the lower as a moving support level.
Perhaps this attempt to relate ordinary trend action to support and resistance phe-
nomena is not founded on any true and fundamental connection between the two,
except in the very broad sense that we should naturally expect resistance to develop
against any great departure from a trend dictated by major, basic conditions. But
when we come to a consideration of the price action that follows characteristically
after a trend line is broken, we have a ‘‘horse of a different color’’. We find that the
old trend line still resists any movement of prices back through it. We had occasion
to refer to this phenomenon in our study of trend lines in the preceding section of
this Course, under the subject of the ‘‘throwback’’ (see page 289).
Broken Trend Lines Soon Lose their Technical Significance
This continuing effectiveness of trend lines after they have been broken disappears
rapidly, however. Once a new trend becomes clearly defined outside the old trend
boundaries, the old trend lines seldom appear to have any technical significance. In
fact, the resistance (or support) to a throw-back usually appears only once; a second
price movement back toward the old trend is likely to meet little or no opposition at
the old line. The longer the lapse of time after a trend line is broken before a throw-
back movement occurs, the less potent the line becomes as support or resistance to
that movement.
The Cradle – a Strong Resistance Point
Knowing that a single trend line has important support and resistance functions,
even after it has been broken for at least a limited time, we should naturally expect
that any point where two trend lines come together would be doubly difficult for
prices to penetrate. This is, in fact, the case and suggests the name ‘‘cradle’’ for such
a point.
The cradle appears where any two converging trend lines cross. Its appearance in
a rapid upward trend is illustrated by the Anaconda chart (Fig. IX.5), where the two
lines, A and B, intersect at the 30 level during the first week of May, 1936. Note the
reaction of prices to this point. Prices do not always return to a cradle, but it is
notable that they do return in many cases, and that the movement almost invariably
is stopped there and reversed. Later on, well beyond the cradle, one or both of the
trend lines may be broken.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
Resistance and Support at Head and Shoulders Reversals
The various reversal and continuation formations studied in the first part of this
Course also have characteristic support and resistance lines which, like trend lines,
function strongly for a certain length of time after
prices have left the formation. In the case of the

first broken, giving the signal of a reversal in trend,
prices may return to it but very seldom are able to
get back through the line by any decisive margin. Where the neck-base line is a hor-
izontal one, the support or resistance which it sets up is easily explained by our gen-
eral rules brought out in the first portion of this Study. Where the neck-base line
slopes up or down, however, its function as a support or resistance is comparable
only with the similar action of trend lines.
A good example of resistance at the extended neck-base line of a normal Head and
Shoulders top can be seen in the week of October 24 on the chart of Union Carbide
and Carbon (Fig. IX.6). The functioning of a sloping neck-base line as a support is
shown on the chart of the Head and Shoulders top in Union Pacific on the same page
(see weeks ending October 12 and 19).
Like the minor support and resistance levels which we studied on the daily chart
of Snider Packing (Fig. IX.4), the support and resistance function of a neck-base line
is, for the intermediate trend trader, more to be ‘‘honored in the breach than in the
observance.” The return of prices to that line is not to be considered abnormal, nor
does it contradict the forecast of the Head and Shoulders formation. So long as the
neck-base line ‘‘holds’’ (as it nearly always does) against any attempt of prices to
move back through it again, the original forecast is still in force.
Support and Resistance Lines on Multiple Formations
In our analysis of the Double Top and Double Bottom, and the related multiple for-
mations (in Study IV) we observed that a Double Top is not completed technically
until prices have declined from the second top down through the level of the ‘‘val-
ley’’ between the two tops. We can now relate this observation to our study of sup-
port and resistance phenomena. The ‘‘valley’’ indicated a support level and, until
this support was penetrated, we could not conclude that a reversal of trend had
occurred. Of course, once this support level is penetrated it becomes a resistance

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
level to any subsequent advance. The same principle applies in the analysis of the
other varieties of multiple tops and bottoms.
Applying the Rules to the Rectangles and
Right-angle Triangles
A similar support and resistance interpretation applies to the action of prices within
and after they leave a Rectangle. Obviously, the upper and lower boundary lines of
this familiar and dependable forecasting pattern are resistance and support levels.
When a break-out occurs, penetrating one of these levels, that level changes its role
at once; if the price advances, breaking the upper or resistance level, that level there-
upon becomes a support. Prices may continue to advance for a few days or even for
a week or two following the break-out and then react to the level of the top of the old
pattern, and get support there, before a strong up-trend develops. When prices
break down out of a Rectangle, the bottom or support boundary becomes a resis-
tance level to which a subsequent rally may return, but seldom penetrates.
In the same manner, the upper or horizontal boundary of an Ascending Triangle
becomes a support level after a break-out; and the lower boundary of a Descending
Triangle becomes a resistance level. The support action was demonstrated in the
movement of prices after the break-out from the Ascending Triangle in Anaconda
Copper which we examined in Study VI (page 188). An excellent example of the
resistance function of a Descending Triangle appeared in the American Can chart in
Fig. VI.5; and the same rules apply, of course, to any pattern with a horizontal
boundary line.
Support and Resistance Set Up by Symmetrical Triangles
When we come to analyze the points at which evidences of support or resistance
appear after a break-out from a Symmetrical Triangle, we find a quite different type
of action. The pattern of support and resistance lines which form around the latter
part of a Symmetrical Triangle is an interesting one and might almost be compared
to a ‘‘magnetic field.”
The first line of defense against any return movement of prices following a deci-
sive break-out, depends on how far from the apex the break-out occurs. If the break-
out takes place before the pattern is completed – say, only half or two-thirds of the
distance from the beginning of the formation toward its theoretical apex – and prices
thereafter do not move very far away before a reaction occurs, we may expect that
reaction to be halted at or near the extended boundary line of the formation. In other
words, if prices break out on the up-side and then the advance is halted very quickly
and reversed, the upper boundary of the original pattern becomes a support line, in

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
much the same fashion as a trend line after the latter has been penetrated. If the
break-out occurs on the down-side, the lower boundary of the Triangle becomes a
resistance line to any immediate rally.
A good example of support at the boundary of a Symmetrical Triangle appears in
the chart of Chicago Pneumatic Tool for the last half of 1935, reproduced in Fig. IX.7.
The price pattern which started to build in the third week of September broke out
with a decisive advance, attended by a conspicuous burst of volume, on November
4. This advance, however, was continued for only one more day of trading and then
prices dropped back (with volume characteristically diminishing). On November 12
the price range touched the extended top boundary of the Symmetrical Triangle and
‘‘bounced’’ away again. Of course, we should not expect that support will always
make itself evident so precisely at the exact line as it did in this example; a fraction
of a point either way in a stock selling in this range would be an equally good man-
ifestation of support.
The Apex Level Becomes Significant
Now suppose that our Symmetrical Triangle formation does not break out until near
its apex, and a reaction ensues before prices have moved very far away from the
break-out level. In that case the normal expectation is that the return movement of
prices will meet resistance at the approximate level of the Triangle’s apex. An illus-
tration of this may be seen on the 1931 chart of US Industrial Alcohol in Fig. II.3.
Within the large Head and Shoulders top that formed in February and March in this
stock there was a good Symmetrical Triangle bounded by the heavy dotted lines.
This was broken on the down-side, near its apex, on March 12 but no great pressure
of liquidation developed on the first break-out and a short rally ensued. Note how
this rally was halted for three days, however, at the apex level, and the downward
movement then got under way in earnest.
The potency of the apex level for support or resistance seems to extend for some
distance beyond the apex itself and the chart student is sure to find in the course of
his charting operations many examples of reactions to this level following an initial
break-out from a Symmetrical Triangle formation. So long as this level resists the
return of prices back through it the forecast given by the break-out may be consid-
ered to be still in effect.
The Symmetrical Triangle Forms a Cradle
The intersection of the two sides of a Symmetrical Triangle forms a cradle, just as
does the intersection of converging trend lines previously discussed. And, just as we
might expect, this cradle point puts up a very strong resistance to any attempt of

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
prices to move through it, and such an attempt is usually reversed very quickly. An
example of resistance at a cradle point appears in the late 1936 chart of New York
Central in Fig. IX.8. Following the top in this stock in mid-October, a broad Sym-
metrical Triangle was built by the price action from October 26 to November 12.
After the break-out on the down-side, the price rallied, on November 17, to the bot-
tom boundary of the Triangle and met resistance there as we might have anticipated.
The ensuing decline extended to 411/4where another minor reversal occurred, tak-
ing the stock back up to 451/2on November 28. There it met resistance at the cradle
formed by the extended sides of the Triangle. A later rally, in the second week of
December, was turned back below the apex level, at the extended top boundary of
the Triangle which thus functioned in much the same manner as any trend line. The
sides of a Symmetrical Triangle may, in fact, be considered minor trend lines.
The Symmetrical Triangle in the New York Central chart was actually a part of the
larger Complex Top which the student has no doubt recognized; its price action was
quite well defined but the volume during its formation was irregular. The pattern of
resistance levels following its break-out, however, was exactly what might have
been anticipated, and the fact that resistance was encountered at these levels on
three strong rallies, tended only to confirm the Triangle forecast calling for a further
decline.
A Third Significant Level
We have considered in the preceding paragraphs the levels where support or resis-
tance may be anticipated when a minor reversal occurs shortly after a breakout from
a Symmetrical Triangle and before prices have moved very far away from the pat-
tern. In a majority of cases, however, a decisive break-out carries prices quite a dis-
tance before the movement is halted or ‘‘corrected.” In such cases we should not
expect a return all the way back to the apex level, at least not without some fairly
definite indication of a change in the technical trend. In the normal sequence of price
movement we find, in fact, that once we have gotten well away from the Triangle
any minor reversal or ‘‘correction’’ is usually stopped at the approximate level of the
extreme top (or bottom) of the Triangle, made at the beginning of its formation. In
other words, we have now left the ‘‘magnetic field’’ of the Triangle itself, and may
look for the more common support and resistance action which was exemplified in
the Snider Packing chart in Fig. IX.4.
A small-scale but perfectly typical illustration of this action appears in the Electric
Boat chart (Fig. VI.1). Note that the reaction following the breakout from the small
Triangle on December 5, met support at 113/4the level of the top of the Triangle. The
Auburn chart (Fig. III.7) shows two good examples of this type of support – on
November 15 at the top level of the preceding Triangle Bottom, and on December 20

at the top level of the preceding Continuation Triangle. The latter level still held as
a support, in fact, on the next reaction in the second week of January.
Refer also to the weekly chart of Texas Corporation (Fig. III.13) for an example of
resistance at the bottom extremity of a Symmetrical Triangle. Compare the Triangle
which formed December, 1930 to February, 1931 with the advance in August, 1931.
Judgment Required in Forecasting Support Levels
We have seen in the foregoing study of Symmetrical Triangles that the levels at
which support or resistance may normally be expected to develop, depend on the
extent of the price movement following the break-out and the time when the reverse
movement occurs. It is impossible to lay down any exact arithmetical rule by which
the chart student may determine just where and when one level has been passed and
another reached. Experience as well as study is required to gain a sound judgment
of what constitute critical levels at any stage of price movement. The beginner need
not be unduly alarmed, however; if he studies his charts carefully and analyzes
every action and reaction with respect to the patterns preceding it, he will quickly
acquire a ‘‘feeling’’ for support and resistance phenomena and, incidentally, a great
respect for this very interesting subject.
Support and Resistance at Gaps
One more phenomenon requires some brief consideration in connection with our
pattern studies and that is the effect of Gaps on support and resistance levels. When
a Gap appears as prices break out of a technical for-
mation, we have learned that such a Gap is seldom

support or resistance level which would stop any
attempt of prices to return to the old pattern. A reac-
tion which follows shortly after an upward Break-away Gap is, in fact, usually sup-
ported at or near the level of the top of the Gap. Note for example the price action
on June 19 on the Johns-Manville chart in Fig. III.12. And downward Gaps set up
similar resistance levels.
Continuation Gaps sometimes function in the same way. A good example of sup-
port at the level of an upward Continuation Gap appears in the Timken Roller Bear-
ing chart (Fig. IV.6). Note the Gap formed during the second week of February at
the 52 level and the reaction to that level the first week of March. Generally speak-
ing, if the Gap is a wide one, we may expect some support at its top level; if that fails

to hold, support may appear within the Gap or at its bottom level; if those fail, the
suggestion is that the price movement will continue eventually to the next support
level.
Practical Uses of Pattern Resistance Study
We have given considerable time and space in this chapter of our technical studies
to the analysis of the various support and resistance levels which are normally
developed by the principal continuation and reversal formations. It would be nat-
ural to ask why we need to pay so much attention to them. One reason – and the
most important one – is that an understanding of the normal habits of price move-
ments saves us from undue worry. We shall not become too concerned if we have
bought a stock when its chart showed a decisive break-up out from an Ascending
Triangle, for example, and then see the price react right back to the level of the Tri-
angle. So long as the normal support appears at that level, we may retain our confi-
dence in our original forecast and expect the worthwhile upward movement
predicted by the Triangle to come in due time.
A Second Opportunity to Buy or Sell
A second, very practical reason for studying support and resistance phenomena in
connection with forecasting formations, is that we are often enabled thereby to make
a commitment at a profitable level which we missed
making when it was first signalled on the chart. For

Many experienced technical traders, in fact, buy only a part of their ‘‘line’’ on the
break-out, figuring on buying the rest when and if a reaction to support takes place,
even placing an order in advance to buy at the anticipated support level. There is
much to be said in favor of this policy but the beginner should keep in mind the fact
that such reactions do not always occur – or if there is a quick reaction it does not
always carry back to the support level. A rapid review of the illustrations of typical
formations throughout this Course will show that in the great majority of cases the
most favorable buying (or selling) opportunity comes as soon as the break-out
shows up on the chart.

STUDY IX
How Long Are Previous Levels Valid
The question arises frequently in technical chart analysis as to how long a previous
support or resistance level retains its power and importance. It is admittedly diffi-
cult to arrive at a definite answer. Some clues may be gleaned from our study of the
possible explanations of these levels at the beginning of this chapter; we have noted
also that volume is a factor to be considered.
Speaking very generally, the support and resistance levels established by minor
fluctuations such as we saw in the Snider Packing chart (Fig. IX.4), lose their impor-
tance after two or three months. On the other hand, the support and resistance lev-
els established by the tops or bottoms of important intermediate movements in a
major trend (such as we saw in the weekly chart of General Electric in (Fig. IX.1) may
still be effective after a lapse of years when the next major trend brings prices back
to those levels. We have, then, the general rule that the greater the movement which
produces it, the longer the potency of any level in future market action.
Then, in the next major trend we may, of course, have new levels develop – as well
as the old ones that repeat – and these new levels
may become significant in turn in another later

important level in future trading. So far as we can
see on this chart, however, it is to be regarded only
as one of our minor levels which may soon lose its value.
Another factor seems to have some bearing on our question of longevity and that
is the sharpness of the price movement to and away from the original reversal level.
A gently rounding top following a slow rise in prices, usually has less effectiveness
as a support level after a lapse of time, than does a sharp peak formed by a rapid
advance of prices and then a rapid retreat. In this connection note the long lasting
importance of the 42 level in the General Electric charts (Figs IX.1 and IX.2) first
established by the sharp drop to that level in the Fall of 1929 and the fast subsequent
rally away from it.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
Fifty and One Hundred as Critical Levels
Every follower of the stock market has noticed at one time or another how price
movements are halted and congestions developed around the even fifty and hun-
dred levels. There is no doubt but what prices have difficulty in many cases in
‘‘working through’’ these levels. The reason is, probably, simply a reflection of the
tendency we all have to think in round numbers. How often we hear the casual com-
ment on a stock selling at say, 42, that it ‘‘ought to go to 50’’. Traders are apt to place
buy or sell orders at these round number levels, and what started as a purely artifi-
cial resistance becomes reinforced by public covering or profit-taking taking, as a
consequence of which the influence of these levels on future market action is further
strengthened. Moreover, in former days, 100 was the par value of most leading
stocks and ‘‘par’’ was naturally an important and significant level, tending to stop
any movement of prices through it from either direction. Such very artificial support
and resistance levels, however, are not as powerful as those more natural levels pre-
viously discussed; the back history of trading, after all, is our best and safest guide.
The Half-way Intermediate Movement Theory
Although it is not; perhaps, related technically to our study of support and resis-
tance, this seems to be a logical place to take up briefly a general theory of price
action which has, at one time or another, been given considerable attention by mar-
ket analysts. This theory states that when a major movement is interrupted by a
reversal, this interruption is to be regarded as only an intermediate movement so
long as it retraces half or less than half of the ground covered by the previous major
move. If the assumed intermediate movement carries on and retraces more than half
the ground covered by the previous move in the direction of the major trend, then
the suggestion is that a reversal in the basic trend may be in the making. What we
assumed at first to be only an intermediate correction may now very likely become
instead the first true movement in a new major trend.
Examination of a great many charts over a period of years shows that this theory
has some foundation in fact, but is not an altogether reliable trading rule. The major-
ity of intermediate corrections do not retrace much over a half of the previous move-
ment in the direction of the major trend, but some retrace two-thirds of the distance
and occasionally a correction will take prices almost all the way back, without the
basic trend being reversed. Two-thirds is, perhaps, a safer limit to set: an intermedi-
ate movement then which retraces two-thirds of the distance covered by the previ-
ous major movement would certainly be subject to suspicion as indicating a possible
major reversal.

==================================================

STUDY IX
The ‘‘Bounce’’ Away from Support or Resistance
One more point remains to be discussed in connection with the practical application
of our support and resistance study, and that is the action of prices when they
approach such a level. A quick inspection of the various chart examples we have
used to help our understanding of these phenomena, indicates that prices may do
one of two things – they may either halt and build a pattern of congestion lasting for
some time before the level is finally penetrated, or they may ‘‘bounce’’ back into a
reversal movement of more or less importance.
There seems to be no dependable guide to forecasting which type of price action
will follow the attainment of a critical support or resistance level. (In fact, we have
seen that occasionally there will be no halt of any consequence in the current move-
ment, but that is the exception rather then the rule). We must take into account other
chart factors, such as volume, the extent and sharpness of the preceding movement,
the character and size of the pattern from which it arose, the appearance of the charts
of other stocks, and the market as a whole, as well as the potential strength of the
anticipated support or resistance. And then we must watch to see what sort of pat-
tern develops on the individual chart of the stock which has reached this critical
level.
A Good Place to Take Profits
In the final analysis, it is a pretty safe rule to withdraw from the stock when it nears
what looks as though it might be a strong support or resistance zone, depending
upon your position, and wait to see what develops before again entering the mar-
ket. If, for example, we had bought General Electric in 1935 and had carried it up
into February, 1936 (see Fig. IX.2), we should have been well advised to sell it and
take our profit when it approached the 42 level which previous trading history had
indicated would likely be a ‘‘tough’’ resistance point. Then we might wait to see
whether GE could work through that level before we bought it again, or watch for
the building of some strong ascending pattern to indicate that the advance was
ready to continue. Such a pattern did, in fact, develop (on the daily chart of the
period) in May, 1936.
The natural corollary of this sound trading rule suggests that it is not good prac-
tice to buy a stock – that is, take a new long position in it – when the price is close
under a strong resistance level. We may have a break-out from what appears to be a
powerful pattern just two or three points under a resistance level; judging by the
pattern alone we might be tempted to buy, but we know that the resistance is there
and may overcome completely the technical strength of our pattern. In such cases,

==================================================

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
the conservative trader waits to see whether the resistance will ‘‘hold.” If the resis-
tance level is decisively broken then he can confidently count on a worthwhile
movement.
Use of Support and Resistance Levels in Short Selling
We have already noted, on page 307, the failure of even the best nearby support lev-
els to hold in the panic phase of a bear market. At these times prices drop precipi-
tately, under pressure of accumulative margin calls and forced selling, until weak
holdings and the public generally have been thoroughly shaken out. With this
exception, however, bear market tactics differ in no respect from the bull market tac-
tics discussed in the paragraphs above.
It is not advisable to sell a stock short when its price has dropped to, or is nearing,
a good support level. The safest level at which to go short is after a rally to the vicin-
ity of a resistance point, or right after a decisive break down through support. Then
as the next support level is approached the short sale should be covered and the
stock given a chance to rally before again selling it short.

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
The trader in stocks has three questions to decide before he takes a position in any
particular issue. They are:
1. When has a movement started?
2. In which direction will prices move – up or down?
3. How far can the movement carry before it is reversed, or halted in a long and
unprofitable congestion?
The first two of these questions are answered directly and with a high degree of
dependability for the technical student, by the patterns and formations we have ana-
lyzed in the first seven chapters of this Course. The third question, however, is cer-
tainly of equal importance, for with all the market to choose from, we naturally want
to use our trading capital to best advantage at all times. We want to buy or sell only
those stocks which promise the most worthwhile movements percentage-wise. So it
behooves us in interpreting our charts, constantly to compare one opportunity with
another and to estimate as well as we can which offers the greater profit.
Back History of Support and Resistance
In our study of Support and Resistance (Study IX) we saw how useful those levels,
established in the previous trading history of a stock, became in forecasting its
future market action. Especially in the longer range analysis of major and interme-
diate trends as pictured on the weekly charts, the influence of old support and resis-
tance points was clearly evident even after the lapse of years. From those levels we
derive our first and best aid in estimating the probable objective of a price move-
ment once it has gotten under way. Suppose we find amongst the number of issues
we are charting, two stocks in about the same price class which have developed for-
mations of apparently equal strength, both breaking out at the same time in what
would seem to promise a profitable upward movement. But suppose the back his-
tory of one, as shown on its long-range weekly chart, indicates a probable resistance
zone only a few points above the current price level, while in the case of the other
there is nothing in the back history to suggest any resistance for 20 or 30 points
above the break-out. Obviously, other things being equal, the second stock has a bet-
ter chance of making a worthwhile advance than the first. The first may conceivably,
if its technical action is very strong, plow right through its old resistance level and
move on up for many points without a halt, but the odds are against it; the more
likely consequence is at least a long and patience-trying delay at the old resistance

level, with the possibility even of a reaction and the building of another pattern
before the resistance is finally penetrated.
Noting Significant Price Levels on Current Charts
A thorough and painstaking analysis of the trading history of any stock whose mar-
ket action we may wish to chart for trading purposes, is therefore well worth the
time and trouble it entails. That trading history is most easily studied and the prob-
able levels of support and resistance determined through the medium of the weekly
charts. And our study should carry back at least to the beginning of the preceding
major trend. In other words, if we are charting a stock during a long-term bull mar-
ket movement we should examine its trading history all the way back to the top
from which the preceding bear market started. If we are following a stock in a bear
market we should analyze its action back to the bottoms from which the preceding
bull market started, in order to determine its probable support levels.
If we wish to be particularly thorough we may carry our studies even farther back
into history by means of monthly charts, with a view to establishing the most impor-
tant levels which tend to repeat as supply or demand areas. Monthly charts may, in
fact, be used instead of the weeklies in analyzing the trend immediately preceding
the current one, but some of the significant levels as well as the volume action tend
to become obscured on the monthly charts; the weekly record if available is much
more helpful. Once we have determined as well as we can through our study of past
trading history the levels where resistance or support are most likely to be encoun-
tered by our stock in its current trend, we can note these levels on our current daily
charts. We may even mark these levels according to their anticipated importance, by
means of some convenient code. By transferring our notations from one sheet to the
next when it becomes necessary to start a new sheet, we can thus keep before us con-
stantly a valuable gauge to our stock’s potential movements while we watch its
daily action to determine when to trade in it, and save ourselves the time and labor
of digging out the back history every time the stock moves.
Trend Lines as Measuring Indications
In Study VIII we studied trend lines and trend action, and we learned that once a
definite trend has been established we can place a reasonable degree of reliance
upon its continuance, at least until strong signs of reversal appear. In trend action,
therefore, we have another gauge as to the probable objective of a current minor or
intermediate movement; the odds favor its being halted and reversed in the vicinity
of the trend line toward which it is moving. The exact price level at which this rever-
sal occurs will depend, however, on the ‘‘angle’’ of the movement – that is, on the

time it takes prices to get to the trend line. If the trend channel slopes at a steep angle,
any minor price movement within it in the direction opposite to, or across, the basic
trend may be extremely limited in terms of actual price change. This important con-
sideration was illustrated very well in our analysis of the trend line action in Indus-
trial Rayon (Fig. VIII.7 and pages 280–1).
Primary Trend Lines More Dependable
Generally speaking, we find trend lines most helpful in our measuring forecasts
when we apply them to the ‘‘corrective’’ movements which run contrary to the gen-
eral trend. Trend lines work best, for example, in defining the probable limits of
intermediate advances within a major bear market, or the minor advances within an
intermediate downward trend, and vice-versa in bull movements. In these cases we
are, of course, working with the single or primary trend lines which, as we have
learned, define the tops in a declining trend, or the bottoms in an advancing trend.
Only occasionally can we draw good workable parallel or secondary trend lines;
when we can, they are very useful in suggesting the probable objectives of price
movements in both directions within the trend channel.
Measuring Implications of Patterns Themselves
The student will see that both of the preceding methods of estimating the probable
extent of a price movement depend on our recognizing in advance certain condi-
tions which tend to set a limit to that movement,

appears on the charts. In such cases we are obliged
to make our estimate of the probable extent of
movement by reference to its origin; we look to the pattern from which it sprang, or
to signs that develop within the movement itself, to determine how strong it is and
how far it is likely to go.
In our earlier Studies, we learned that in a very general sense the larger and
clearer the pattern, whether it be a reversal or a continuation formation, the more
extensive the movement of prices we may expect to follow its completion. We made
note also of the fact that the direction of the basic trend must be taken into account
in appraising the importance of a pattern. Prices tend to move more easily in the
direction of the fundamental market trend. Consequently, in a general bull market

comparatively small bottom patterns may produce surprisingly extensive upward
movements, while very large and impressive top formations may be followed by
quite insignificant declines. In a general bear market we are apt to have just the
opposite, of course, with top patterns producing long and extensive declines, and
bottom patterns comparatively small rallies. This consideration of the basic trend,
however, need not concern us when we are comparing the patterns appearing
simultaneously in two different stocks both of which are evidently working in the
same trend.
Measuring Implications of Head and Shoulders
The first reversal formation which we studied in this Course, was the Head and
Shoulders. In our analysis of this pattern we made brief mention (on page 63) of one
fairly reliable measuring formula that may be applied to it. This formula may be
simply expressed as follows: the price movement will proceed at least as far (in
terms of points or dollars) after the breaking of the neck-base line, as the vertical dis-
tance in points from the level of the head to the neck-base line, before it is halted. The
halt at that point may be only a very brief one, followed by a resumption of the
movement, or it may develop into a minor and temporary reversal, sending prices
back in the opposite trend to the level of the old neck-base line before the movement
originally forecast by the Head and Shoulders is resumed. Or a complete technical
change may develop at that point canceling and reversing the Head and Shoulders
forecast.
Testing the Head and Shoulders Measuring Formula
We may apply this rule to the various Head and Shoulders formations pictured on
the charts in our preceding lessons and check its accuracy. Starting with the Head
and Shoulder top in Republic Steel (Fig. II.1) if we draw the neck-base line across
points C and I, the vertical distance from that line to the top of the head is about 28
points. The neck-base line was broken at the 112 level by the price action of the last
week of October. Applying our measuring rule, we should expect a halt in the down-
ward movement to show up on the chart 28 points lower, or around the 84 level. The
movement was not, in fact, halted until it had reached 73, where a minor rally sent
prices back up to 89.
In the Head and Shoulder top in Western Union (Fig. II.2), our rule worked out
with surprising accuracy, but in the case of the US. Industrial Alcohol top, (Fig. II.3)
the rule called for a halt around the 56 level and the movement shot right through
this level and showed no signs of stopping until it reached 38. The rule worked on
the Borden chart (Fig. II.4), and in connection with Head and Shoulders bottoms, on

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
the Montgomery Ward chart (Fig. II.6), also on the Du Pont chart (Fig. II.7). On the
Woolworth chart (Fig. II.5), on the other hand, the measurement of the small Head
and Shoulder bottom called for a first advance to about 52 before a halt; instead a
minor reversal occurred at G at 501/2. The formula applied to the larger, outer,
Head and Shoulder called for an advance to 56, and this also failed by a slight mar-
gin.
Reliability of Head and Shoulders Measuring Rule
Inspection of the examples cited in the preceding paragraphs gives us a very good
idea of the degree of dependability we can place in our rule, although it is suggested
that the student check all the other Head and Shoulder formations he has available,
including Figs. II.9, III.5, IV.10, and IX.8. It is interesting to note in the case of the last,
the New York Central chart (Fig. IX.8), that our rule calls for a halt at about 40
whereas a minor reversal occurred at 411/4. Evidently, this measuring formula works
fairly well but with many exceptions. It is hardly necessary for us to lay down any
practical trading rule based on it. It may prove useful occasionally as suggesting a
good point to take profits for a quick turn, provided another more interesting oppor-
tunity is in the meantime showing up on another chart.
Measuring Implications of Triangles
Students of the technical action of stocks have, from time to time, attempted to dis-
cover dependable measuring rules that can be applied to price movements arising
from Triangle formations. It is our conclusion based on a critical examination of
many hundreds of examples that no reliance can be placed in any of the theories that
have been suggested. The most interesting of these theories states that prices will
move about the same distance (in points) from the break-out level to the next halt or
reversal, as they moved from the last preceding congestion to the first reversal point
which started the Triangle. We refer to this theory as interesting because it does
seem, to work out in many cases. One such case appears in the Holly Sugar chart
(Fig. VI.2) and several fairly close examples in the Omnibus Corporation chart (Fig.
V.11) and the Electric Boat chart (Fig. VI.1). A quick look at the many other Triangles
pictured in this Course will shown, however, that the formula does not work out in
the great majority of cases. Obviously, also, it cannot be applied at all to Reversal Tri-
angles.
A more conservative measuring formula applied to Triangles states that the
movement on the break-out will proceed at least as far as the extent of the price
range at the open end of the Triangle or, in other words, the greatest depth of the pat-
tern itself. It would appear that this Triangle measuring rule does work out with

considerable dependability, but that we can account for the movement more rea-
sonably on the basis of either trend or support and resistance action, usually the for-
mer.
Flags and Pennants as Measuring Patterns
Although, as we have seen, little practical trading dependence can be placed in any
measuring implications of Triangles, we find an entirely different situation when we
come to examine the price action which follows the completion of those closely
related patterns, the flags and Pennants. These two very interesting and reliable con-
tinuation formations give us, in fact, some of our most accurate measuring forecasts.
The Flag we have learned (Study VI) forms on a mast – a nearly vertical price
movement, either up or down. The length of the mast (in points) from the preceding
congestion to the point where the Flag begins to form, will be found to indicate in by
far the great majority of cases the extent of the rapid price movement which proceeds
from the last reversal point in the Flag. Refer for example to the Flag shown on the
Deere & Co. chart (Fig. VI.14). The mast on this chart ran up 18 points, from about 57
to 75 at which level the Flag began to develop. Note that this measurement is taken
to the top of the Flag. Now the bottom of the Flag from which prices resumed their
rapid advance, formed at the 69 level; adding 18 points to 69 gave us 87 as the prob-
able immediate objective of the movement, exceeded in fact by only two points.
Measurement Applies Only to the Mast Itself
The same rule applies with equal dependability to all types of Flags as well as to
Pennants. A clear cut example of its accuracy in connection with an upward flying
Flag in an up-trend appears on the International Harvester chart (Fig. VI.16), the
comparable points in this case being 79 to 91 and 89 to 101. Note, however, that in
determining our measurement we take only the length of the mast itself from the last
preceding congestion or minor reversal point, disregarding any previous price
movement. In the case of the first Flag formed early in March on the Greyhound
chart (Fig. VI.15) we should measure only the mast from the minor reversal at 30;
and in the case of the third Flag formed at the end of April we should measure only
from the week’s congestion at the 39 level.
The Flag Rule Does Not Forecast A Reversal
The Greyhound chart (Fig. VI.15) will serve also to illustrate another point in con-
nection with our Flag measuring formula. This formula gives us the probable imme-
diate objective of the price movement but does not call for a reversal of trend or even

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
a long halt when that objective is attained. We may, in fact, have only a very brief
halt at that level and then a rapid continuation of the previous trend, which was the
case in Greyhound in the Spring of 1935. The masts on that chart, it will be noted,
were quite short and the Flags relatively large. When a mast is long (in terms of
points), however, and its Flag relatively small, we should naturally expect the move-
ment to be pretty well exhausted when its indicated objective is reached. In brief, we
should apply the same judgment in our practical trading use of this measuring for-
mula that we know it is necessary to apply in trading on any technical patterns or
theories. If the movement seems to have carried prices as far as we might reasonably
expect, then the Flag ‘‘yard-stick’’ indicates a very good level at which to take prof-
its, step aside, and watch for further chart developments.
The ‘‘Half-mast’’ Congestion Pattern
Flags (and Pennants) are apparently created by quick profit-taking in unusually
rapid price movements, but it is difficult to explain by any logical reasoning just why
they should appear in most cases so close to the half-way point in the course of such
movements. Of course, the fact that they do is what we are chiefly interested in in
this study, rather than in the possible reasons for it. Whatever the reasons may be,
these same causes apparently are to be credited with producing another measuring
pattern which carries the same forecast as the true Flag.
This closely related measuring pattern we have called the Half-mast Congestion.
It can hardly be classified as a pattern at all in the sense in which we have used the
word throughout this Course, for it does not take any single definite form. It is sim-
ply a very compact price congestion which forms on a ‘‘mast’’ and extends for five
days up to three weeks, its duration depending roughly on the length of the mast.
This congestion may take on the appearance of a very small ‘‘solid’’ Triangle or Rec-
tangle, with volume tending to shrink as it forms, just as we expect volume to act
toward the completion of any true continuation formation. In some cases it cannot
be related visually to any of our recognized patterns but it is, in all cases, notably
solid or compact and it should not show any tendency for prices to ‘‘give way’’, or
for the price range to broaden out. It forecasts a rapid continuation of prices in the
same direction and about the distance as the mast which preceded it, and more often
than not suggests a good level at which to take profits.
Examples of Half-mast Congestions
An almost perfect example of this extremely helpful measuring formation is shown
on the chart of Western Union for the last half of 1935 (Fig. X.1). After struggling
for two months, the 51–52 resistance level was penetrated with a terrific burst of

activity on October 14 and a nearly vertical advance to 64 ensued. There the move-
ment was halted, and the price action built a very compact congestion pattern with
volume declining until November 7 when another burst of volume appeared and
the price moved up in less than two weeks to 77. Measuring from the break-out level
at 52 to the top of the first mast at 64 gave us our measurement of 12 points for the
probable extent of the next move; note how accurately this forecast was borne out.
This particular Half-mast Congestion bears a slight optical resemblance to, but can-
not be strictly defined as, a Triangle; it is, however, a very compact congestion with
no semblance of ‘‘give’’ to it. If we were not already ‘‘long’’ of Western Union at this
time we might well have bought the stock when we saw its price and volume action
on our chart through the week ending November 2.
A Less Distinct Example
The chart of US Rubber for the first half of 1936 (Fig X.2), contains another good
example of a Half-mast Congestion formed during the week ending March 21. In
this case, prices advanced in a ‘‘mast’’ from 191/2to 27 and then built a compact con-
gestion around the 26 level for a week during which volume declined. A rapid con-
tinuation to about 34 was indicated and did in fact get started on March 24 (note the
volume) but in this case the movement was quickly halted around 30 where it had
carried out only half of its indicated advance. Two weeks of indecisive action ensued
and our Half-mast pattern at this time appeared to have been thrown overboard by
the sharp reversal in the general market trend which was then occurring. Neverthe-
less, on April 8 another burst of activity appeared and the price was marked up to
its predicted goal.
Reliability of the Half-mast Pattern
The two examples of Half-mast Congestions which we have shown worked out so
accurately that it is, perhaps, necessary to pause here and repeat once again our
words of caution against an utter and blind dependence on any technical pattern or
other forecasting indication. There are no such words as ‘‘always’’ or ‘‘never’’ in the
technical analysis of stock charts. The Half-mast congestion and the Flags are very
dependable patterns as technical formations go, but they may and do occasionally
violate all the rules and disappoint us by failing to work. The trader who buys or
sells on their implications must be ready to change his mind and abandon his posi-
tion when the ‘‘exception that proves the rule’’ does appear.
Like the Flags and Pennants, the Half-mast Congestion appears in down as well
as up trends, and carries the same forecast in either direction.

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
Measuring Theories Applied to Gaps
Still another set of measuring theories has been based on the appearance of price
Gaps. In fact, Continuation Gaps have been called Measuring Gaps by some stu-
dents because of their reputed measuring value.

selves to a measurement of technical strength or
weakness, which in turn should be expressed in the
subsequent price advance or decline. Logical or not, however, we have found that
none of the various Gap rules or theories works out with sufficient accuracy to make
it a thoroughly dependable guide in trading. Nevertheless. It will pay us to examine
two of these theories because they do express, however inaccurately, a measurement
of price movements in which Gaps appear contrary to the habits of the stock under
observation.
The Single Gap Measuring Theory
One measuring formula which is applied to a chart in which a Continuation Gap
(see pages 252–4) appears following a normal break-out and a more or less rapid
price movement, states that the movement will continue from one to one and a half
times as far beyond the Gap as the distance from the break-out to the Gap. In other
words, the first Continuation Gap in a rapid advance or decline (provided it was not
preceded by a Break Away Gap) comes when the movement is about 40% to 50%
completed. In applying this rule, we must of course, bear in mind that Gaps in a thin
stock which shows Gaps frequently, have little or no technical significance.
An application of the Single Gap Measuring Theory may be made to the chart of
US Steel Fig. X.3. No Gaps appeared in the price action of this stock through Janu-
ary, 1936. At the end of that month prices broke out of a small Symmetrical Triangle
on the up-side with a good increase of volume but with no apparent disposition to
‘‘run away’’. The movement gathered strength on February 10, however, advancing
nearly four points on that day and closing near the top of the day’s range at 551/2.
The strong upward push continued on the following day, taking the price to 581/2
and leaving a Gap of nearly a full point behind it. Considering the habitual close
overlapping of daily price ranges in ‘‘Steel’’, this was a noteworthy performance and
gave us an opportunity to test our measuring theory. The movement from the break-
out at 49 to the Gap at 56 (disregarding fractions) covered 7 points, and the forecast

of the Gap called, consequently, for a further rapid advance of from 7 to 10 points.
This would take the stock to somewhere between 63 and 66 before we should expect
a halt or a reversal to develop. ‘‘Steel’’ did, in fact, move right up to 65, thus carry-
ing out the forecast most generously.
Wide Variance in Movements Following Gaps
Now, it is only fair to state that the student with plenty of chart history available can
find a goodly number of examples to prove almost any measuring formula within
reason which he may choose to demonstrate. It is easy to find them, that is, after the
movement is completed. But, in the practical application of the Single Measuring
Gap Rule, at the time a Gap appears on our chart, we are often faced with the diffi-
culty of deciding just what price level we should take as the origin of the movement
and from which our measurement should start. Also we are not always able to
decide positively and immediately whether we are faced with a Continuation Gap
or an Exhaustion Gap. Finally, even when the origin of the movement is well defined
and the Gap is obviously of the Continuation class, the subsequent movement may
fall far short of the suggested limits or extend far beyond it.
Single Gaps in rapid price movements appear in the chart of General Theatres
Equipment (Fig. IV.12) and the chart of Standard Oil of NJ (Fig. V.5). In the former a
Gap came between April 22 and 23 in the down trend following a Head and Multi-
ple Shoulders top reversal. The theoretical neck-base line of the top pattern (drawn
across the bottoms of January 29 and March 13) was broken at the 101/2 level by
the price action during the week ending April 11. The Gap appeared at 73/4. Apply-
ing our rule, a further rapid decline of from 3 to 41/2 points was suggested. The
actual decline carried prices down 4 points, and was almost completed in a single
day.
A Less Easily Interpreted Example
In the Standard Oil of NJ chart (Fig. V.5) a conspicuous Gap which was quite evi-
dently of the Continuation class, appeared between March 24 and 25. Before we
could apply our measuring rule we had first to determine our starting point. The
safest – certainly the most conservative – level from which to measure was the small
and rather indefinite price congestion at 67 next below the Gap, and that measure-
ment did work out very well in forecasting the next minor congestion. Taking a
longer view of the chart, however, it was apparent that a more important ‘‘break’’
had occurred at the 64 level where a down-sloping intermediate trend line across the
January–February tops had been penetrated with a significant increase in volume.
Measuring from 64, a movement to between 77 and 80 was called for. But, looking

==================================================

STUDY X
still farther back, we saw that the rapid upward trend in which our Gap appeared
had really started out of the small bottom congestion at 61 (note volume) and, from
that base, our Gap might forecast a continuation of the advance to somewhere
between 79 and 84 before reversal. Either of these interpretations, as it happened,
would have worked out fairly well since the first reversal came at the 80 level.
The student should refer also to the following examples which appear on the
plates in previous lessons, some ‘‘worked’’ and others didn’t.
Fig. I.3 – The quarter-point Gap at 131 following the breaking of the trend line
on July 28.
Fig. II.1 – The large Gap at 118 in late August.
Fig. II.3 – The small Gap at 58 in late March.
Fig. V.13 – The Gap at 112.
Fig. VI.8 – The Gap at 101/2the week ending August 10.
Probably it is not necessary to add to our discussion of the Single Gap Rule the
caution that a Gap should be disregarded as a basis for measuring if it is quickly cov-
ered.
The Multiple Gap Theory
In the preceding paragraphs we have studied the measuring formula applied to a
single Gap of the Continuation type appearing in an otherwise normal price move-
ment. If, however, a movement starts with a Break-away Gap and then shows a Con-
tinuation Gap, the logical supposition is that we have to deal with a more drastic
technical change and may expect a more extensive move to follow.
This is expressed in the Multiple Gap Measuring Rule which states that the move-
ment will continue about two times as far beyond the second Gap as the distance (in
points) between the first and second Gap.
A good, clear-cut opportunity to apply this rule appeared in the US Industrial
Alcohol chart (Fig. VII.15). Prices broke out of the Continuation Rectangle on the
down-side with a Break-Away Gap (D) on May 19. This was followed immediately
by a Continuation Gap (E). The first Gap appeared at the 45 level and the second at
411/2, a difference in points of 31/2. Two times that was 7. The forecast, then, was that
the movement would continue on down 7 points from 411/2, or to somewhere
around 341/2. The down trend was, in fact, halted at 331/2.
May Be Applied Also to Two Continuation Gaps
The same measuring formula is applied to the appearance of two Continuation Gaps
in a rapid price movement, as well as to the combination of a Break-away and a Con-
– 348–

tinuation Gap, and may be carried on indefinitely, in theory at least, so long as Con-
tinuation Gaps continue to show up in the movement. Of course, common sense
warns that any abnormally rapid price movement must run into trouble eventually;
an over-bought or over-sold condition is apt to develop very quickly. Consequently,
we should not place too much reliance in any measuring rule based on them. There
is always the danger that one of our Gaps will turn out to be of the Exhaustion vari-
ety.
A Working Example of Measuring Gap Analysis
For the application of the Multiple Gap Rule to Continuation Gaps we may turn
back to our old friend, the Woolworth chart (Fig VII.14). The first opportunity to test
the rule came when the Continuation Gap B appeared immediately after the Break-
away Gap A. These two Gaps were approximately 11/2points apart so their forecast
was for a further advance of about 3 points which, added to the 561/2level of the sec-
ond Gap, gave 591/2as the probable objective. Gap B was followed immediately by
C, however, giving us a new base from which to measure. Skipping the arithmetic
details, which the student can easily work out for himself, we now had a new fore-
cast calling for a further advance to somewhere in the 60 range, a forecast which was
carried out very nicely in short order.
The next opportunity to test the rule came when the Break-away Gap at E was fol-
lowed by another Gap in three days at the 62 level. This combination called for con-
tinuation to 65. Instead, a small Island Reversal developed and prices dropped back
to the support level of the Gap at E before the advance was resumed. The forecast,
as it happens was carried out later but, in the mean time, the rule had failed. Still
another test came in the final rally when Gap F was followed by G, forecasting con-
tinuation by our formula to about 711/2. This, as can be seen, was not quite carried
out. The volume at this stage, however, made the Gap at H appear too suspiciously
like an Exhaustion Gap to lead us to expect much more of the movement and, when
the Gap was closed the next day, its exhaustion character was established.
Dependability of Multiple Gap Rule
The Woolworth chart gives us a very fair test of the Multiple Gap Measuring Theory
and confirms the necessity for exercising caution as a movement extends farther and
farther from any good foundation pattern. It demonstrates the inadvisability of rely-
ing too stubbornly on the measuring rule. The chart should be watched closely and
constantly for other technical suggestions, and the measuring forecast should be
abandoned promptly as soon as any upsetting factor appears. The difficulty which
we noted in Study VII of distinguishing positively between Continuation and

Exhaustion Gaps, further emphasizes the risk attending a blind dependence on the
Multiple Gap Theory.
The Chrysler chart (Fig. IV.7) may also be studied with reference to the applica-
tion of the Multiple Gap Rule in a case where the two Gaps occur at a considerable
distance apart – about as far apart, in fact, as we should expect to find them useful
for measuring purposes. Generally speaking, the closer together the two Gaps, the
more dependable their measuring forecast.
The Time Element in Measuring
Before we leave the subject of measuring rules, it may well be stated again that we
have never found a time cycle theory that could be depended on in practical trad-
ing. The study of time theories is fascinating; it has intrigued analysts into the most
exhaustive research; yet not one single reliable rule of time has ever been discovered.
FALSE MOVES AND SHAKE-OUTS
Various allusions have been made from time to time in previous chapters to the mat-
ter of False Moves and Shake-outs but up to the present we have offered no adequate
explanation for this phenomenon. These movements do occur; however infre-
quently, and are sufficiently misleading (at least to the neophyte) to warrant the fol-
lowing detailed observations.
In so far as their chart interpretation is concerned there is really very little differ-
ence in the implications of the two terms. ‘‘False Move’’ and ‘‘Shake-out’’ – in fact
many students use them indiscriminately to describe identical situations and we
have but little quarrel with this alternate usage.
Specifically, though, the term ‘‘False Move’’ is more commonly used to designate
a somewhat longer price movement than the ‘‘Shake-out’’ – the latter usually con-
suming but a day or two (similar to the One-day Reversal or One-day-out-of-line)
while the False Move is less sharp and may extend over a week or more. The Shake-
out may occur at almost any time, inside or outside a formation, while the False
Move is usually considered as applying to those puzzling, rather indecisive, but
comparatively limited price movements which proceed out of definite formations in
the wrong direction, i.e. – opposite to the subsequent true or more extensive move-
ment. The assumption is that the Shake-out is definitely engineered by operators in
order to ‘‘cross up’’ the public, and catch stop-loss orders before starting their mark-
up or mark-down campaign, while the False Move proper is rather the result of tem-
porary market indecision or withdrawal of professional activity.

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
The Chart’s Most Confusing Enemy
In any event, we are not so much concerned with their causes as we are with their
results. For the purposes of this study we may use the one term ‘‘False Movement’’
to describe all price movements which give, or appear to give, a wrong forecast. If
they proceed far enough (in terms of price movement) and are accompanied by
increased volume they become the most dangerous and troublesome of all price for-
mations in chart analysis, and practical market trading. They may simulate a gen-
uine and valid break-out, leading us to take a position in a stock, which the
subsequent movement proves to be wrong. In such cases actual loss as well as worry
and mental confusion may result.
Even when they do not carry out all the requirements of a valid break-out, they
are confusing and upsetting, throwing into doubt, temporarily at least, the entire
theory of practical trading on chart patterns. Suppose, for instance, that a strong and
highly dependable downward reversal formation has finally been completed, with
every positive indication pointing to the early beginning of a long and profitable
decline in a stock. But just as the stock looks weakest and perfectly prepared for
commencing that major decline, the price suddenly jumps several points in a few
days. This movement would be exactly contrary to the dictates of our technical
analysis. But we have learned by constant precept, if not yet by practical experience,
that no chart formation is infallible, that they all go wrong at times, and that when
they do, the ensuing major movement is usually in exactly the opposite direction
from what was anticipated. It is easy to see, therefore, that such a sudden advance,
even though small, when we expected a major decline, can upset all carefully laid
plans, and can lead to mental and personal confusion on the part of the practical
chart student or trader.
Such a false move can so upset the average trader that he decides his chart has
failed, his analysis has proven false, and that he should switch his forecast from a
long downward to a major upward, movement. Consider then the further chaos of
analytical judgment when, just as he has reversed his original analysis, the false
move comes to an end, the stock drops off again, and then proceeds to embark on
that long, powerful and profitable major downward movement which the observer
had been correct in predicting from his original analysis of the downward reversal
pattern.
Misleading False Moves Fortunately Rare
The False Movement may appear in almost any situation whose chart formation is
susceptible to definite and dependable analysis, which means that it may appear in

connection with practically any formation which our studies have taught us to rec-
ognize and credit with forecasting value. Fortunately, the majority of False Move-
ments should not lead to our actually trading on their misleading implications
provided we apply to them the ‘‘acid tests’’ for a valid break-out which we have pre-
viously studied. Nevertheless, we should give some attention to the kind that ought
not to mislead us into taking an incorrect position, as well as to those rarer examples
which are our chief concern because they do definitely give an incorrect forecast. We
must learn to recognize them and to defend ourselves against them, not only with a
view to cutting possible losses but also for the sake of perfecting our knowledge of
how stock prices can act, and avoiding loss of confidence in our forecasting meth-
ods.
Triangles Most Susceptible to False Moves
We have already seen that the Triangle may be either a reversal or continuation pat-
tern, though it appears more often as a continuation. Its double entendre results in
the necessity, in most instances, of withholding our
forecast for the direction of the next important

confusing influence of false movements. Also, from
a purely logical and natural standpoint, we might
expect False Moves to occur in connection with Triangles, especially at the apex,
because as that apex is neared, activity is so low and the price range so narrow that
it takes only a very small over-balancing of the technical status quo to bring about
an erratic and temporarily false price movement. In these same circumstances it is
evident also how easy it is for professional operators to engineer a False Move. We
do not wish to imply that all False Moves are purposely engineered by insiders but
some of them certainly are.
The Ordinary Symmetrical Triangle False Move
A good example of the False Move out of a Symmetrical Triangle appears in the
chart of General Motors for 1936, (Fig. X.4). This shows what might be called the
more ‘‘normal’’ type of False Move, and one that should not have led to a wrong
forecast. Note the Symmetrical Triangle formed by the price action from April 30 to
June 1, with volume declining as the pattern approached its apex. The Triangle had
become so narrow by June 1 that any ordinary price range would almost inevitably
have to penetrate one of its sides. The lower side was, in fact, penetrated on June 2

and prices ranged indecisively downward for three days, closing on the 4th and 5th
at 61, a full point below the penetration. Then the trend was reversed, indecisively
again, until June 10 when prices rose a point and a half, closing above the Triangle’s
apex level, and a good advance ensued. Now note carefully the volume action
attending this performance. During the entire week in which prices ranged below
the Triangle, activity was at an extremely low ebb – lower than during any of the pre-
ceding weeks on this chart – but, when prices started to advance, volume picked up,
with a notable increase on the day that the apex level was penetrated on the up-side.
Most False Moves Attended by Low Volume
This example, as stated, shows the more normal and less deceptive type of False
Move in which volume remains at a low ebb during the movement of prices in the
wrong direction, and increases when the true trend gets under way. We can see that
in this case the False Move did not give a valid break-out signal; the price movement
was indecisive and there was no pick-up in volume such as we expect to accompany
a good break-out from a Symmetrical Triangle. Consequently, if we were following

ume closely, we should have suspected a False
Move and, when the volume picked up the follow-
ing week, that would have confirmed our suspicions and led us to the correct fore-
cast for a price advance.
The Exceptional False Move with High Volume
A more unusual and much more deceptive type of False Move out of a Symmetrical
Triangle is shown on the chart of Hiram Walker (Fig. X.5). In this case the Triangle
was completed by August 5 but no break-out developed; prices continued in an
indecisive side-wise trend until the end of the week when, on Saturday, volume
picked up and prices started to fall. By the following Tuesday, August 11, price and
volume action both indicated a valid break-out on the down-side and called for a
further decline. On the next day, however, despite even greater volume, the price
held firm. Two days later it advanced and closed above the apex level, and on Sat-
urday it gained over a point and a half, with terrific volume, leaving behind it a full
point Break-away Gap.
The subsequent action in Hiram Walker requires no comment. The price move-
ment from August 8 to 12 was a False Move of the most dangerously confusing sort,

displaying no clue whatever as to its real character. There was nothing for the trader
who acted upon it to do but reverse his position quickly when the true movement
developed, and take a small loss for the sake of the much greater gain to be antici-
pated from the true move. This False Move bears every evidence, as we examine the
completed chart, of having been definitely engineered by insiders for the purpose of
shaking out stock in weak hands, to add to their ‘‘line’’ before they started to mark
it up. It is, in brief, the type of movement we might term specifically a Shake-out and
it is fortunate, indeed, for the technical trader that such movements are extremely
rare in today’s markets and cannot be accomplished without the signals for the true
move being all the more quickly and conspicuously given. We shall refer to this
point later on in this study when we consider the bright side of the Shake-out pic-
ture.
False Moves from Right Angle Triangles
The two examples of False Moves previously shown have arisen out of Symmetrical
Triangles and it is noteworthy that in each case they occurred after the formation had
been completed into its apex. False Moves develop also out of Right-angle Triangles
under the same circumstances but, quite naturally, are not so apt to mislead us since
any price movement contrary to the trend suggested by the pattern itself would be
subject to distinct suspicion. We have had occasion to refer briefly to one such False
Move in our preceding lessons, in connection with the Ascending Triangle in Ana-
conda Copper (Fig. VI.4) and it is suggested that the student refer back to that chart
and the comments on page 188 regarding the False Move. The pattern in Anaconda
Copper suggested definitely by its ascending nature an eventual break-out on the
up-side. Consequently, the movement January 17 to 21 ran contrary to the forecast of
the pattern itself, and when we considered also the low volume attending it, we
ought not to have been misled into relinquishing a profitable long position, much
less into selling short, until more definite indications appeared on the chart. It should
be emphasized that False Moves of this sort out of Ascending or Descending Tri-
angles seldom ‘‘spoil’’ the pattern or occasion the re-drawing of boundary lines.
False Moves out of Rectangles
We have come to regard the Rectangle as an especially dependable forecasting pat-
tern; any False Move arising out of a rectangular formation should therefore be most
deceptive and this is, in fact, the case. It is encouraging to know that False Moves
occur with extreme rarity in connection with Rectangles, but that only makes the
exceptional break-out that turns out to be false all the more liable to misinterpreta-
tion.

==================================================

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
An example of this abnormality is shown in the American Machine and Foundry
chart, Fig. X.6. The price action in this stock from July 8 to August 25, 1935, built a
Rectangle with volume diminishing notably during the last week of this period, sug-
gesting an imminent break-out. On August 27, prices broke down through the lower
boundary line, at the 23 level and closed at 221/4 at the bottom of the day’s range,
with a goodly increase in volume. This had every appearance of a valid break-out,
lacking only a small fraction of a point of carrying out the full price movement we
like to have for a decisive break in a stock selling at this price level. The next day’s
action failed to carry the movement any farther, however, and then volume ran low
again for nearly a week with prices showing no decision. On September 9 a strong
upward movement started, producing a valid breakout with high volume, on the
11th, and a good advance ensued.
The False Move vs. the Out-of-line Move
What makes a False Move out of a Rectangle even more treacherous when it is
attended by increased volume is the quite natural assumption on the part of the
technical trader that he is dealing with an Out-of-line movement. When, for exam-
ple, prices closed back on September 6 within the bounds of the Rectangle on the
American Machine and Foundry chart, it was logical to consider the preceding
downward break as an Out-of-line movement forecasting the eventual true trend.
The break-out in the opposite direction comes therefore as an entirely unexpected
and highly disturbing development.
False Moves Following Head and Shoulders
Another rare type of False Move, also highly deceptive, appears when prices break
the neck-base line of a Head and Shoulders formation and then refuse to carry on in
the trend which this action forecasts. An example of this phenomenon appears in the
New York Central chart (Fig. IX.8). Note the Head and Shoulder pattern formed by
the price action from July 23 to August 21, with the left shoulder formed July 28, the
head August 6, and the right shoulder August 19. The neck-base line of this pattern
slanted upward slightly and was broken on August 21 when, on increased volume,
prices declined to 39 and closed nearly at the bottom of the day’s range. This was
approximately a full point penetration – virtually enough, considering also the vol-
ume and closing level, to call it a valid breakout. On the next day, however, prices
ranged back up and closed at the neck-base line, and did not close below the line
again. On August 27, with volume again increased, a strong upward move got
under way.

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
Defense against False Movements
The student may well ask, after reading the foregoing and examining the chart illus-
trations, if we are constantly at the mercy of these misleading phenomena. To a cer-
tain degree the answer must be, frankly, that there is no adequate or infallible
defense against the most extreme type of False Move. But the extreme type is not
common and against the more common, normal type of False Move we do have var-
ious helpful safeguards.
One such defense, as we have already noted, consists in a close observation of vol-
ume. In most cases, if the volume tends to increase on a move out of a pattern, or
through a critical chart line, then the move is more likely to be genuine. If volume is
low, or tends to diminish on the move, then it is more likely to be a False Move. This
is logical because when insiders are ready to move a stock on a long major swing,
they have cleaned up most of the shares available around its current levels, and it
does not take much volume at that stage to produce a move. If the operators now
wish to force a False Move, they will try not to lose any more than is absolutely nec-
essary of their now-precious position. And if, as is quite possibly the case, their engi-
neered False Move meets public action tending to reduce their position instead of
increasing it as was intended, then they will certainly cut short their deceptive tac-
tics. If, on the contrary, the move out of pattern is genuine, then insiders know they
must act boldly and quickly to complete their position before their move attracts
other traders to that side of the market.
The Shake-out on High Volume
There is one notable exception to the rule that low volume indicates a False Move
and high volume a true trend. That is the One-day Reversal or turnover day. Such a
day is marked by high volume almost all day, but with the price starting in one
direction in the morning, reversing itself on volume, and coming right back again in
the afternoon to the early morning level. When such a One-day Reversal breaks out
of a pattern it is more characteristic of the Shake-out. In any case, it is easily distin-
guished by the reversal which takes place during the day, indicating that the early
move was a false one and that at least the nearby trend will probably be in the oppo-
site direction. It will be readily seen, of course, that such brief Shake-outs seldom
take prices far enough out of pattern to constitute a dependable break-out signal,
especially if we demand, as we should, that prices not only move but also closeout
of the pattern by a decisive margin.

==================================================

STUDY X
Strict Construction of Break-out Rules
To sum up, our best defense against the commoner manifestations of the False Move
lies in taking a very strict and conservative attitude toward all break-outs, both as to
volume and extent of price movement, as well as closing level. If, in addition to
meeting all of these requirements, the break-out is accompanied by a Break-away
Gap (in a stock where Gaps are infrequent) we may, of course, feel doubly confident
of a true movement.
In this connection it should be noted again that any break down out of a pattern
occurring on or within a day or two following an ex-dividend or ex-rights day
should be disregarded unless subsequent price and volume action confirm the break
as due to more permanent and basic factors. This is particularly true if the break is
accompanied by only ordinary volume and the amount of the price drop is closely
comparable to the amount by which the stock is ‘‘ex.” An example of a False Move
attributable to ex-dividend action appeared in the International Harvester chart
(Fig. VI.16), in the week ending September 19.
The Use of Stop-loss Orders Against False Moves
We already know from experience, or shall soon learn (later on in this study), the
practical advantages of using stop-loss orders in most of our market trades. As a
defense against that rare and most deceptive type of False Move which gives every
price and volume indication of a genuine and valid break-out, the correct placing of
stop-loss orders is most important. Unfortunately, one of the often cited drawbacks
to the employment of stop-loss orders is the danger of their being caught by just
such extreme cases of False Move or Shake-Out as we have been examining. Admit-
ting this danger, especially if the stop-loss is injudiciously placed, we hold never-
theless that its habitual use is indicated.
Stop-loss orders should be so placed as to reduce the chances of their being caught
by anything but a true movement. That means that they must be set far enough
away to reduce to a practical minimum the probability of their being ‘‘touched off’’
by a Shake-Out. An experienced eye and seasoned judgment, as well as an under-
standing of the basic principles of placing stop-loss orders deserves a more extended
consideration than we can give it here parenthetically in our False Move Study. We
shall take it up in detail later in this lesson, starting on page 363 and that section
should be studied with the possibility of False Moves always in mind.

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
False Moves Have Their Bright Side
Once we have watched the development of a False Move on our charts, and have
clearly identified it as such, there is one very cheerful conclusion we may draw.
There is very rarely more than one False Move out of a pattern. We are warranted,
therefore, in feeling reasonably certain that we will encounter no False Move in the
opposite direction. For that reason, many technical traders actually welcome False
Moves because of the decisive action of prices to be expected in the opposite trend
once the False Move has been completed and the true movement started. Thus a
False Move, though perplexing at the time it is occurring, becomes really a friend in
disguise, giving us confidence to maintain our position when prices have started to
move conclusively in their true trend.
To sum up, False Movements are to be expected from time to time on our charts,
and we should be constantly on our guard against them. Although they may occur
from almost any type of pattern, they seem to
appear more frequently near the apexes of Triangles

swinging shake-out type, against which there is
little-protection, other than replacing our original
position when warranted by later technical action, is very rare. All in all, false moves
are not so much to be feared as to be recognized for what they are and turned to all
possible useful advantage.
The ‘‘End Run’’ – Not a False Move
A phenomenon of price action which occasionally shows up on the charts and which
might appear upon superficial analysis, to be related to the False Moves we have just
been studying, is the ‘‘End Run.” This occurs when the price movement proceeding
from a perfectly valid break-out, out of a very strong pattern, fails to carry as far as
the strength of the pattern forecasts, but is instead quickly reversed into a consider-
able movement, in the opposite direction. A good example of this End Run action
appeared in the chart of Kennecott Copper for the first half of 1936 (Fig. X.7). A
strong Ascending Continuation Triangle developed in this stock during the period
from February 19 to April 4 with a strictly defined top or resistance boundary at 39.
Prices broke decisively out of this formation on April 6 and every chart indication
called for an extensive advance. Instead, the movement was quickly reversed
around 411/2 and a rapid decline ensued, right down through the natural support
level formed by the top of the previous Ascending Triangle, and on to 331/2, for an 8

could not long withstand the general liquidation

but is quickly reversed.
End Runs are also occasionally traceable to previ-
ously indicated strong resistance (or support) zones
close to the break-out level. In those cases our study of the back history will usually
forewarn us and prevent us from relying too heavily on the implications of the pat-
tern alone. In the Kennecott chart the back history showed that strong resistance
would probably be encountered in the 41–42 zone, and that the upward trend might
in consequence be halted there for a time, but the extent of the reaction to 331/2could
not be explained on that basis.
Where the End Run is caused by general market conditions, or by unexpected
developments of an important basic nature affecting a whole industrial group, the
breaking of what should be a strong support or resistance level set up by the pattern,
is a definite warning to step aside with as small a loss as possible and wait for the
situation to clear up. In the case of Kennecott the price and volume action from April
20 to 23 was conclusive; the decline might well have extended much farther than it
did if the fundamental situation in this stock, reflected by its previous technical pat-
tern, had not been so strong.
Like False Moves, End Runs are not common but it is important to recognize them
for what they are and be prepared to act promptly on their appearance.
STOP-LOSS ORDERS
We have referred briefly in our study of False Moves to the defensive use of stop-loss
orders, but that is only one quite limited consideration in their employment. Their
first purpose – to minimize losses – is suggested by their name, but they can also
play an important part in the protection of any profits already accrued on a success-
ful trade in the event of a sudden or unpredictable reversal of trend. In general, they
serve the broad and most important function of almost automatically enforcing the
observation of one of the cardinal principles of successful trading, the principle
expressed in the old market adage, ‘‘Cut your losses but let your profits ride.”
It is ‘‘unfortunately’’ quite normal and human for inexperienced traders to be too

readily satisfied with small profits while they let their losses on their unsuccessful
commitments run on and on to serious proportions. This misguided policy accounts
for a fact which brokers frequently comment on, that the majority of the individual
transactions made by their clients show a profit yet a distressingly large percentage
of their accounts show net losses on balance at the end of any considerable period.
A few needlessly large losses have more than outweighed many small profits. The
constant, habitual use of stop-loss orders on every commitment, long or short, will
correct this tendency. Stops, properly placed, will hold to moderate limits any loss
on your original capital – will protect your entire capital plus the expenses incident
to your commitment as soon as it begins to run in your favor – and will subsequently
and progressively insure the capture of a large share of your paper profits as they
accrue.
The Mechanics of the Stop-loss Order
A stop-loss order, or more strictly just a ‘‘stop’’ order in the technical language of the
exchanges, is an order placed with your broker to buy (or sell) a definite number of
shares of a particular stock only when and if a transaction in that stock has been
recorded at or beyond a specified price. The stop order is not executed until after the
stock has been traded at (or beyond) the price it specifies. Suppose, for example, you
have bought 100 shares of US Steel at 50 but do not wish to keep it if its price falls to
48 or lower because its decline to that level would change the technical picture and
indicate still lower prices to follow. You can ensure your stock is sold promptly in
that event by placing a stop order with your broker at 48, ‘‘good until canceled.” The
order remains on his books unexecuted until you cancel it or until Steel sells on the
exchange at 48 or below. A decline to 481/2will not affect it, but as soon as a transac-
tion at 48 or lower takes place your stop order becomes in effect a regular market
order and your broker immediately sells your 100 shares of Steel at the best obtain-
able bid.
If your stop order calls for the sale of an ‘‘odd lot’’ (anything less than 100 shares
in the cases of most stocks) your order is executed at 1/8point beyond the first full lot
transaction occurring after your stop price has been reached.
Stop-loss orders in actively traded issues are usually executed quite close to the
‘‘stop’’ price specified in the order, but in the case of infrequently traded (‘‘thin’’)
issues, and on opening transactions affected by important unexpected news, stop
orders may be executed several points away. This occasional and, naturally, most
distressing execution (some points beyond your stop limits) should not, however,
deter you from continuing without fail to employ stop orders in your trading activ-
ities. Seldom will the eventual outcome fail to justify the wisdom of the stop-loss
order.

==================================================

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
When to Place Stop-loss Orders
One question in connection with our consideration of stop-loss orders can be
answered quickly and definitely, and that is the question of when to place the stop
order. It should be placed at the same time you make your original commitment or,
at the very latest, just as soon as you have notice from your broker that your regular
order had been executed. There is no occasion for any exception to this rule. Your
judgment in the placement of stop orders will be far better at the time you make
your commitment than later on, after you are committed, under stress of puzzling
market action, perhaps, or news releases, or the fear of ‘‘taking a loss.”
When you see strong technical evidence – a valid break-out, for example, from a
definite reversal or continuation pattern – which warrants the purchase or sale of a
security, you should at the same time examine the picture and decide at what level
a price movement in the opposite direction would indicate that your forecast had
gone wrong, or beyond which you would not care to hold your position. Then place
your stop-loss order at that level at the same time you instruct your broker to buy
(or sell) the stock for you.
Shifting the Stop-loss Order
Once your stop-loss order is placed it should never be shifted except to some level
farther along in the direction of the trend that shows you a profit – the trend which
you anticipated in making your commitment. If your forecast works out you can
and should move your stop order along, but remember that your first stop-loss
order is placed to hold any possible loss to a minimum. It should not be moved
except to conserve profits. If you have bought and have placed a stop order at a price
below your commitment it may be moved higher but should never be moved lower.
And, conversely, if you have sold short and have placed your stop-loss order above
your commitment, shift it to lower levels as profits develop, but never move it
higher.
Where to Place Stop Orders
There are many arbitrary formulas for the placing of stop-loss orders. While we may
grant readily that any formula – even a rigid arithmetic rule – is better than none, the
correct placing of stops should be governed primarily by the technical pictures we
have studied in this Course. The principles, after all, are quite simple. Stops are used
to relieve us quickly and automatically of ‘‘bad trades’’ if the forecasts upon which
we based those commitments turn out to be mistaken, or if there is an unexpected

change in trend. They should be placed, therefore, so that they will be caught by any
price movement which reverses our original forecast or indicates that a trend which
has been working in our favor now has turned against us. At the same time they
should be so placed that they will not be ‘‘touched off’’ by any minor movement
which does not upset or reverse our basic forecast.
The application of these principles is not difficult. We can study them most easily
by reference to a specific chart example. Let us take a ‘‘long’’ commitment first and
see where stop orders should be placed to protect it. Suppose, for instance, we had
been attracted to the possibilities for profit on an advance in US Rubber common
stock in the Fall of 1936. During August and September this stock made a Symmet-
rical Triangle which is shown in Fig. X.8. On September 23 the price advanced out of
the pattern with a conspicuous increase in volume, which, although the closing price
was hardly out by a decisive margin, strongly suggested the advisability of an
immediate purchase, especially in view of the fact that the general market at that
time was in a major cyclical up-trend.
Applying the Principles to a Long Commitment
In making this purchase, we were firmly convinced that a strong upward movement
in US Rubber was ready to start but we had to take into account the possibility of
either a False Move or an Out-of-line Move. If we were dealing with an Out-of-line
Move, our purchase would eventually show a profit and should be held, but in the
meantime the price would drop back into pattern again. In that event it should not
drop by any considerable margin below the bottom of the last dip or minor reversal
in the pattern made during the week ending September 19, at 30. But we have to
make some allowance for a sharp shake-out; experience has indicated that a fair
allowance is about 5% of the value of the stock. In the case of US Rubber, which at
this bottom was around 30, 5% would be about a point and a half; so our stop-loss
order should be placed 11/2 points below 30, or at 281/2. With this determined, we
would proceed to give our broker an order on September 24, to buy US Rubber at
the market and, at the same time, a stop-loss order to sell it at 281/2 Stop. On Sep-
tember 25 the price did drop back into the pattern slightly but turned up again on
the following day and moved rapidly away, leaving our 281/2stop unexecuted.
Before we follow our trade in US Rubber further, perhaps it would be a good idea
to give a little more thought to the 5% allowance suggested in the preceding para-
graph. On a stock selling in the $10 range this would be half a point; in the $50 range,
two and one half points; in the $80 range, four points, etc. This, of course, is an arbi-
trary figure and, consequently, like all of the other arbitrary rules for break-outs and
measurements which we have studied in this Course, it is subject to judgment and
qualification. If the stock in which we are dealing moves habitually within a narrow

range – a stock such as General Motors, for example – we might decrease our
allowance somewhat below 5%. If, on the other hand, we are dealing in a wide
swinging issue like Vanadium Steel, we should allow it a little more margin, say 8%.
A study of the past performance of the stock will generally suggest what deviation,
if any, from the normal may be expected and allowed for.
The First Shift in the Stop-loss Level
Now we can go back to our US Rubber trade and consider the next step in stop-loss
tactics. After prices have moved away from a good forecasting pattern such as we
had in this case, there will occur minor set-backs,
gaps, continuation patterns, and ‘‘congestions’’ or

have learned, establish new minor support points
and give us a basis for the placing of new stop
orders. In ‘‘Rubber’’ we have already had one such – the set-back on September 25,
to 311/2– and after prices moved up and well away from the pattern, we could place
a new stop-loss order at 30, 5% under the bottom of this minor dip, or better at 297/8
since it is good practice to put stops slightly below the round figures such as 25, 30,
50, etc. Shake-outs tend to be stopped at those points.
But here we have another question; how soon is it safe to move a stop order?
Again we shall have to lay down a rather arbitrary rule for our general guidance
with the understanding that it may be qualified by our study of the habits of the
stock. Our rule is to wait until the price ranges of two days are entirely beyond the
price range of the day that establishes the new stop-loss level. If we are working in
an up-trend, as in our US Rubber example, we wait until the low prices on two days
are higher than the highest price during the bottom day of the dip. In this example,
the high range of the bottom day, September 25, was 323/4. The first two days to range
entirely above this were September 29 and 30. On October 1, then, we could cancel
our original stop-loss order placed at 281/2when we bought the stock, and put in our
new stop order at 297/8.
This ‘‘two days away’’ rule (with such modification as the individual situation
and good judgment may occasionally suggest) applies in either up or down trends
and to gaps and the other chart patterns on which we base stop orders as well as
minor reversals. We will apply it as we follow along our trade in ‘‘Rubber’’.
Remember always to cancel a previous stop-order at the same time you place a
new one. Otherwise, both will remain open on your broker’s books and both may
be executed at some later date. Your broker will not cancel the previous stop unless
you so instruct; he is, in fact, bound to execute it so long as it remains uncancelled.

==================================================

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
A Gap Provides a New Basing Point
After the minor set-back of September 25, the price of US Rubber moved up steadily
without giving us any new technical indication for a further shift in our Stop Loss
order until October 3. The price action of that date produced a half-point gap from
351/2to 36. Continuation Gaps, as we know, set up minor support and resistance lev-
els which are not as a rule broken decisively except by a change in trend. Before shift-
ing our stop order from 297/8, however, we should again apply the ‘‘two days away’’
rule. The high range of the gap was 36 and it was not until October 7 that two days
ranged entirely above that level. On October 8 we could cancel our stop order at 297/8
and place a new stop at 333/4, 5% below the bottom of the gap at 351/2.
Following this there was some little further advance and then a set-back on Octo-
ber 23 to 351/4. For the moment this looked like a minor turning point but it was fol-
lowed on the 26th by another decline to 34. That, however, finished the minor
reaction and prices again moved up, leaving our 333/4stop untouched. Note that we
would not shift our stop on account of the new minor bottom at 34, since that would
have meant placing it lower down and the rule is never to move a stop order except
in the direction of profit.
Completing the Trade in US Rubber
Our next opportunity to move up the stop order came on November 18, when we
were ‘‘two days away’’ from the minor bottom of November 14 at 361/2, and could
shift the stop to 5% below that point. We could move it up again on November 24 to
361/2, about 5% under the November 20 bottom. We did not get ‘‘two days away’’
from the bottom of the reaction which came in the first week of December until
December 10, but then we could move our stop to 5% below it, placing it at 411/4.
Over a month then elapsed before we found any development that warranted
another shift. During this period a Rectangle developed with a conclusive break-out
coming on the up-side on January 15, following the five-day congestion – almost a
Flag – from January 8 to 14, and the bottom of this congestion could then be used as
a new base point, bringing the stop up to 441/2.
The gap made by the January 20 price movement enabled us again to move our
stop, this time to 497/8 (avoiding the even 50). Another shift to 507/8, 5% under the
February 5 reaction was called for on February 9. The side-wise congestion of Feb-
ruary 9 to 15 gave us a fair basing point for a shift to 541/4but the more conservative
policy was to wait for a clearer development which did not appear until we had the
reaction to 56 during the last week of February. On March 2, ‘‘two days away’’ from

STUDY X
that bottom day range, we could transfer our stop order to 531/2. On March 8 we
could move it up again to 551/4, basing it on the reaction to 58 on March 4.
Our Stop Finally Executed
The next basing point for a stop order was provided by the large gap which
appeared on March 10. We did not get two days ranging entirely above this Gap
until March 13; then we could transfer our stop order up to 603/4. And that was our
last shift for we were given no new base on which to work higher. The reaction of
March 22 held above our stop level but the sharp drop on April 7 took us out; when
the price declined to 603/4on that day our stop order became a market order to sell
and our broker accordingly sold our stock. We had carried the stock up from around
33 to above 60, taking a gross profit of about 27 points.
Now, after we were sold out on our stop order, the price rallied, worked back in
fact nearly to 66 before the end of the month, but this rally certainly did not suggest
a new purchase. On the contrary, the very decline which ‘‘touched off’’ our stop
order completed an important reversal pattern, a clean-cut (1-2-3-4-5-6). Broadening
Top (see Study IV, page 132), and the rally to 66 barely carried out that 50% recovery
of the last move of the pattern which we have learned to expect in many cases but
which does not always develop. We were well out of US Rubber; six months later it
had dropped to 20.
The Stop Loss Order in Short Selling
The intermediate trend advance we have been following in US Rubber pictures
clearly the helpfulness of properly placed stop orders in keeping a trader in his posi-
tion in the direction of an established trend, and saving him from the worry and
mental confusion of the ‘‘tape watcher’’ or ‘‘hunch player’’ who is so often shaken
out in the early stages of a move. But if stop orders are useful in long trading they
are practically indispensible in short selling operations. When a trader buys long,
the price cannot possibly go against him more than the purchase price of the stock,
whereas when he sells short he runs the risk, theoretically, of an almost infinite
advance. Practically every well-informed economist holds that short selling is justi-
fied on its own merits, but it is certainly not justified from a practical trading stand-
point unless definite stop orders are used on every short commitment.
Placement of the Initial Stop on a Short Commitment
The techniques which we employed in placing stop orders to protect a long position
in our hypothetical trade in US Rubber apply as well, of course, in short trading. The

student, if he has followed closely our discussion and watched the application of our
stop order principles on the US Rubber chart, may need no further explanation of
stop loss technique, but an examination of its use in connection with a short sale will
surely do no harm if we make it reasonably brief.
Let us follow a hypothetical trade in US Steel through the down trend which
started in August, 1937. Figure X.9 shows the daily price and volume action of this
leading stock for the last half of the year. Steel came down from its March top at 127
to a low of 91 in June, 1937, and then in July rallied quickly, almost back to its previ-
ous high. There was fair volume during the first part of this movement but as the
advance tended to slow up in August the volume dwindled away to smaller and
smaller proportions. During the third week of August prices began to drop with
volume increasing. By August 26 a Rounding Top was evident and Steel was obvi-
ously a good ‘‘short.”
There were other evidences in this chart, taken in connection with the preceding
daily chart and the weekly chart, to suggest liquidation of Steel in late July and early
August, but we are concerned now with a conservative short position that would
not be taken until after the change in trend was fully apparent. Such a change was
conclusively indicated, of course, by the development of the Rounding Top which
we have learned (in Study III) is one of the most important reversal formations.
Moreover, it is a formation that appears characteristically at the tops of bear market
rallies and signals, consequently, declines of considerable extent. Its development in
so many leading stocks in August of 1937 was one of the strongest possible confir-
mations of a major bear trend. (Refer to pages 68 and 70 in Study III.)
Stop-loss Orders in Short Trading are Buy Orders
To return to our example, let us assume that we decide to sell Steel short after post-
ing the chart for August 26. Before giving our broker an order to sell it, however, we
must first determine where to place a stop-loss order to take us out of our commit-
ment promptly should our forecast of a decline prove incorrect. Examining the
chart, we find the top of the congestion at 117 on August 23 to be our nearest valid
basing point, so our first stop may well be placed 5% of the price above this level, at
1223/4. Note that in this example we are selling short so our stop orders will be orders
to buy, and will be placed above rather than below the current price. Early on
August 27 then, we instruct our broker to sell, say, 100 shares of Steel short at the
market and, at the same time, give him an order to buy 100 shares at ‘‘1223/4Stop.”
Now here is a case where our rule requires the stop to be placed a considerable
distance away from the current price, about 15 points in fact. In such cases, most
traders would feel, quite reasonably, that they would not care to risk so great a pos-
sible loss no matter how confident they might be in the correctness of their inter-

pretation of the technical picture. Good judgment here would dictate some depar-
ture from the strict rule, bringing the stop-loss order down to, say, 1171/2, slightly
above the minor bottom made on August 11. As a matter of fact, within a day after
our commitment was made we were ‘‘two days away’’ from the small gap made at
113 and could justify by the technical action a stop at 1171/2.
The down gap on the following Wednesday, September 1, with increased volume,
gave gratifying confirmation of our forecast, and when the following two days
ranged well below this gap, we could shift our stop order down to 5% above it, to
1131/2. On September 7 another gap appeared, even larger than the preceding and
with volume still greater; hence on the 9th a new stop order could be based on this
development, bringing our stop level down to 1091/4. The next opportunity to drop
our stop-order down came on September 13 when we could shift it to 1061/8. After
September 23 when prices had dropped ‘‘two days away’’ from the top day’s range
of the preceding week’s rally; our stop at 1061/8could be cancelled and a new order
entered to buy at ‘‘103 Stop.”
For the next four weeks our short commitment in Steel showed rapidly growing
profits as prices continued to tumble. During this period there were several good
technical indications calling for a change in the stop order level. We need only list
them briefly and the student can check them with the chart and discover for himself
in each case the basis for action.
Here are the indicated shifts:
After September 25 – to 963/4
" September 27 – tο 901/4
" October 4 – to 881/4
" October 7 – to 82
" October 11 – to 773/4
" October 20 – to 731/2
By late October the down trend showed signs of slowing up but no evidence of
reversal had appeared as we come to the end of our six months chart. Two more
opportunities to move the stop level in the direction of profit, i.e. down, were how-
ever, presented during November. After the action of November 3 the stop order
could be transferred to 691/2, and after November 19 to 651/4, in each case placing it
5% above the top of the preceding rally. Again, after December 14 it could be
dropped to 63.
The Use of ‘‘Mental’’ Stops
For one reason or another, many traders dislike to use stop orders, preferring to keep
‘‘mental stops’’, as they say, on their commitments, and to give their own market

orders, to buy or sell as the case may be, when their mental stop levels are reached.
Most of the objections to the use of regular stop orders, placed in advance with one’s
broker, are in our opinion of little or no validity in present day markets. One objec-
tion, frequently expressed, is that just at the time stops are caught the market
reverses and moves away again the direction originally expected, with the result
that the trader takes an unnecessary loss and ‘‘loses his position.” Obviously, this
unfortunate experience is due not to the employment of a stop-loss order but rather
in most cases to its improper placement.
Other traders hesitate to annoy their brokers with stop orders, because their
accounts are small or because their broker has spoken scornfully of the practice. To
accept and execute stop orders is a part of your broker’s duty; you are entitled to
courteous and efficient service from him in this matter and should insist upon it.
Good brokers encourage the use of stop-loss orders as a wise and conservative mea-
sure for the protection of their clients’ principle and profits.
Theoretically, there is no reason why a ‘‘mental’’ stop should not serve the pur-
pose just as well as a regular stop-loss order entered with the broker, provided of
course that the trader is constantly in touch with his market and knows at once when
his mental stop level is reached. Practically, however, the temptation is always pre-
sent to delay action at the critical moment, to ‘‘give it another chance,” to shift the
order mentally, and as a consequence take eventually a much greater loss than nec-
essary. In the long run, the experienced trader finds carefully placed stop-loss order
an essential part of the successful trading practice, and by placing them in advance,
‘‘in cold blood’’ so to speak, he avoids the mental confusion and tendency to pro-
crastinate which unexpected turns in the market always create.
Stop-loss Orders of Little Help within Patterns
In the examples of intermediate up and down trends which we have used in this
Study to illustrate the placing of stop-loss orders, note that commitments were not
made until they had been indicated by the completion of important forecasting for-
mations. It is on such relatively safe technical positions that stop orders are most
effective. Some traders like to play for short profits on the minor movements within
patterns, Such as the wide-swinging trading areas which the market developed dur-
ing the months following the October, 1937 ‘‘panic.” Trading within these areas or
wide patterns is precarious at best and, unfortunately, the use of stop orders does
not make it any safer since they can seldom be placed close enough to turn the odds
in favor of the profit side without undue risk of loss. The use of stop orders on com-
mitments made within area patterns cannot be recommended.

MEASURING RULES AND FORMATIONS
Do Not Neglect Other Chart Indications
By dwelling so much in this Study on the importance of employing stop-loss orders,
we certainly do not wish to convey the impression that the student should invari-
ably wait for his stops to be ‘‘touched off’’ before closing out his commitments. In
the great majority of trades the student will, if he follows his charts closely, see some
sign of reversal or exhaustion which will enable him to take his profit and get out at
a much better level than his current stop orders. Measuring formulas, resistance lev-
els, climax volume, exhaustion gaps – all of the various technical phenomena which
we have studied in this Course – should be watched for and used to secure the most
profitable close-out prices.
Other Minor Uses for Stop Orders
Stop orders may also be used to put a trader into a new commitment as well as to
take him out of an old one, or to reverse his position in the market in case of a sud-
den change of trend. If we buy 100 shares of stock, for example, and put in a stop-
loss order below our commitment for twice that number of shares, a change in trend
will not only sell us out of our long position but will also put us short 100 shares at
the same time. This type of stop order is known as a doubling stop or switching stop.
Some traders will anticipate a break-out from a formation, such as a Rectangle, by
putting a stop order in above the pattern at a level that should be reached by a valid
breakout. Thus when and if a break-out develops they are immediately put long of
the stock. These applications of stop orders may on occasion be used by the well-
financed trader but we do not feel that they have any special advantages and do not
recommend them for the average technical student.
Stop-loss orders, after all, are best employed as insurance, as necessary in the busi-
ness of stock trading as other forms of insurance are in other businesses.

USE OF LONG-TERM CHARTS, AVERAGES AND GROUPS
Reviewing the Ground-work
In all of our preceding studies we have been taking up one individual aspect of
technical chart theory after another, studying each one more or less separately, and
attempting to discover its relative merits and importance. This progressive study of
individual phenomena has, it may be hoped, given us a broad fundamental basis
upon which to build and round off our hoped-for education in the entire field of
complete chart analysis.
One by one, we have taken up and studied the tools which shall constitute our
aids in the practical work to come. One by one, we have examined these separate
tools, have observed their individual uses, their importance and their place in the
picture with regard to individual reliability. Having thus completed our apprentice-
ship, it remains only to fit these tools into actual use in the more important task of
practical chart analysis, gradually getting the experience that comes from following
larger pictorial records of trading, deciding for ourselves which tools, which indica-
tors, which formations, to use on each point as it arises, and thus co-ordinating our
individual guides and rules into one compact catalogue of knowledge for success-
ful analysis of any and all types of stock charts, to arrive at our ideal goal of accurate
market forecasting.
The Monthly Chart
In general, we have studied the shorter and more frequent formations developing
on daily charts, but such patterns can be of almost infinite duration, growing
stronger as they grow wider and longer. When these formations drag out for more
than a few months they begin to be more easily discernible on weekly or monthly
charts than on daily ones.
Weekly charts have great usefulness at such times. They have also the important
advantage of requiring much less labor and attention in practical construction.
Moreover, they often call our attention to formations which might not be so clear or
might not show at all on a small daily chart. It should be plain to the reader by now
that the theories and formations which we have studied are applicable not merely to
daily charts, but to charts made up on almost any consistant basis of time or scale.
Likewise, since such theories are merely the resultant phenomena of open-market
trading, they are applicable also to commodity movements, to cotton, wheat and
corn prices, for example, or to the pictorial record of just about any commodity
whose price fluctuations result from supply and demand in an open and free bar-
gaining market. We shall have something to say about commodity charts later, but
let us first study the patterns which may appear on a monthly stock chart.

STUDY XI
Formations Develop on Monthly Charts
The monthly charts of General Motors and Liggett & Myers Tobacco-B reproduced
in Fig. XI.1 show 13 years of price action in these stocks. The vertical lines on these
charts represent the high and low range of prices for each month from January, 1924
to December, 1936, inclusive. The volume does not appear.
The General Motors chart is complicated at first glance by the several split-ups in
this stock, and the 50% stock dividend effected in September, 1926. However, we
need not be disturbed by these changes in the capital set-up from time to time since
the price scale has been adjusted with every change so that the continuity of price
action has been preserved on the chart. The prices along the right-hand margin rep-
resent the price per share as this is written.
Starting in 1924, the first pattern suggested on this chart is a small Symmetrical
Triangle indicated by the price action from November, 1925 to June, 1926, large Tri-
angle indicated by the price action from November, 1925 to June, 1926, followed by
another rapid advance. We have the Accelerating Peak suggested in the first months
of 1927, and then a very good Ascending Triangle at the end of that year which led
in March, 1928 to an advance from 140 to 199 in a single month. At the top we find
a Complex pattern – a Shoulders and Double Head of huge proportions which took
a year and a half for its completion. The ensuing drop took prices down to 34 and
then the price action for nearly two years built the suggestion of an enormous
Descending Triangle leading to a further decline to 8 in 1932. Turning into an up-
trend we find a fair representation of a Flag formed from August, 1932 to March,
1933. The pattern from July, 1933 to March, 1935 looked as though it might be com-
pleted as a Head and Shoulders Reversal but the neck-base line was never broken
and the price action continued on into June, 1933 to build a large continuation Tri-
angle which broke out into a further rapid advance. No definite formation appears
as we approach the end of the chart but the student will readily see the possibilities
for the development of several interesting patterns.
The monthly chart of Liggett & Myers Tobacco-B may be similarly analyzed. From
1924 to 1927 we find a well-defined upward trend with a suggestion of the Acceler-
ating Peak in March–July, 1926. A Triangle Reversal appears at the top in 1927. From
July, 1928 to the end of 1930 we find a fair Inverted Triangle of great size – or this
whole 3 years’ pattern might be called a Continuation Head and Shoulders. Another
large Head and Shoulders Reversal formed the 1931–1933 bottom in this stock, and
the right shoulder of this formation was also a good Flag Continuation. The price
action from November, 1934 to August, 1936 suggests the possibility of a Head and
Shoulders Top which, however, would not be completed. unless the neck-base line
were broken. The action throughout 1936 suggests the a Symmetrical Triangle which

might, of course, signal either continuation or reversal depending on the direction
of the break-out.
Monthly Charts Not Useful in Trading
The student may well be impressed by the power of some of the patterns suggested
by these monthly charts and by the extensive price movements proceeding from
them, but he should recall the many months, and in some cases years, required for
the building of patterns and the long periods during which no patterns appear at at
all. From our brief inspection of these, it is obvious that it is seldom possible for a
trader to make a dependable forecast from the patterns on the monthly charts in
time to profit by them. For ordinary trading certainly the daily and weekly charts are
much more useful and dependable. In the consideration of long-term investment
policies, however, the monthly charts become of use as well as interest, and occa-
sionally they suggest the possibility of important developments which can be
checked on the daily or weekly charts and converted into trading profits.
The Uses of the Average Charts
We have had occasion to refer at various times in our previous Studies to the aver-
ages and the average charts. We have noted that an average is merely a composite of
a certain number of selected individual stocks, and the average chart might be called
a sort of composite photograph of the charts of all those individual issues. These
average charts are subject, within limits, to the same sort of technical analysis which
we apply to individual stock charts. And, because we are dealing with a composite
representing more or less the general market, any technical formations we may dis-
cover in the averages should be more important in forecasting for the whole market
itself than the formations appearing in only one or a few individual stocks. It is easy
to see, in other words, that if enough individual stocks act in sufficient graphic uni-
son to develop a composite chart formation, then the forecast indications are just
that much stronger.
However, we know that it is possible for certain stocks or whole groups of stocks
in a general market average to be in a major down
trend at the same time that the others are trending
Average charts are upward. Even on an important turn in ‘‘the market’’
subject to the technical some issues reach their reversal points weeks or
analysis which we apply months before others. (Compare in this respect the
to individual stock two monthly charts in Fig. XI.1.) For the trader with
charts. a limited portfolio, therefore, who wishes naturally
to employ his capital constantly to the best advan-

USE OF LONG-TERM CHARTS, AVERAGES AND GROUPS
tage, the charts of his individual stocks are of far greater practical value than any of
the averages.
On the other hand, we know that most stocks do follow sooner or later the major
swings of the market. Consequently, for the long-swing investor with a large port-
folio, who is not so much concerned with switching for trading profits from one
individual issue to another as he is with major investment policies or with income,
the averages are of prime importance. The student will find it interesting, as well as
instructive, to apply for himself the various patterns which we have studied to the
daily chart of the New York Herald Tribune’s average of industrial stocks, shown in
Fig. XI.2.
The Uses of Group Charts
In a general way our remarks regarding the broad market averages in the preceding
paragraphs, apply as well to the group averages – the oils, foods, steels, rails, utili-
ties, etc. The student who wishes to buy from time to time or maintain his own
charts of certain industrial group averages will find much of interest in them but rel-
atively little of practical trading value. Just as whole groups of stocks may, and do
frequently, move in a trend opposite to the apparent trend of the general market
averages, so do individual stocks within a certain group move contrary at times to
the trend of the group average. It is perhaps safe to say that as a general rule it is
more profitable to buy stocks whose group shows a strong technical picture rather
than those whose groups shows a weak picture, and vice-versa, yet there are many
exceptional situations.
A comparison of the price action of two different group a verages is afforded by
the charts in Fig. XI.3. These charts show the price range and volume on a weekly
basis of the New York Herald Tribune’s weighted averages of five food stocks and
seven copper stocks, respectively, from July, 1934 to the end of 1936. During the
greater part of this period the average price of the copper group advanced rapidly
and steadily, with set-backs or corrections of relatively insignificant proportions,
while the average price of the food group swung up and down without making
much net progress. On a long-term basis this difference is striking, but it can be seen
that the food group offered just as good trading profits (assuming for the sake of
argument that one could buy or sell the ‘‘group’’) in shorter term operations. In fact,
more money could have been made trading on both sides of the market in the foods
than in the coppers. Forecasting patterns appear occasionally on the group charts,
just as we have seen that they do in the general average charts, but not nearly so
often as on the charts of individual issues.

STUDY XI
Time More Profitably Spent on Individual Charts
The student will have to decide for himself just how much time and attention he
cares to devote to maintaining and analyzing general market and group average
charts. If he is charting a diversified list of 40 or 50 individual issues, his individual
charts will, as a rule tell him all he needs to know about ‘‘the market’’. He must
remember that when a forecasting pattern, no matter how strong, shows up on the
Dow-Jones Industrial Average chart, for example, he cannot order his broker to ‘‘buy
100 shares of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average’’. If a Head and Shoulders top devel-
ops on the chart of the Theatre stocks average, he cannot sell 50 shares of ‘‘Amuse-
ment’’ at the market. He must, in brief, do his trading in specific issues, which may
or may not be moving in the same direction or at the same rate as their group or ‘‘the
market’’ at the time. Only their own individual charts can tell him which to buy or
sell.
Lessons in Long-term Analysis
As we complete these analytical studies of the long-swing price movements in sin-
gle issues, in groups and the general averages, we may pause to consider any gen-
eral lessons which their observation might suggest. For one thing we may repeat
that successful practical trading from chart action comes not from following with
blind and dogmatic confidence every technical suggestion that may appear, but
rather by keeping always an open mind, and using the many individual chart fac-
tors merely as an aid to general analysis.
We may also observe the advantages of playing the major trend, once it is defi-
nitely confirmed, and letting one’s intermediate market position always favor that
major trend when there is any doubt about intermediate movements.
And this leads to still another rule, that in almost all cases the trader should com-
promise with his own opinions, with the chart forecast, with any and all ordinary
and normal future indications, preferring to take
the middle of the road rather than veering impetu-

words, sell out gradually when it appears that the

gradually when it appears that the end of a long bear trend is approaching. This rule
applies primarily, of course, only to cyclical or semi-investment operations, rather

than to the ordinary trading in which it is presumed that most students of this
Course are interested.
SHORTER TIME INTERVALS IN CHARTING
Another general aspect of chart science upon which we may well touch in rounding
out our technical education, is the application of chart formations and principles to
practically any time range interval which we may choose in pictorializing the origi-
nal trading record. The major portion of our studies has been conducted upon the
basis of daily ranges, since the daily charting interval has proved to be by far the
most practical and most useful for ordinary operations and for ordinary technical
analysis.
We have seen, however, that this daily interval may be expanded to give weekly,
monthly, or even yearly charts, each of which may have certain advantages. We may
also observe that on the other side of the daily charting interval we may break down
the time element to almost infinitely small proportions, to include hourly charts,
fractions of the full hours, and even down to the extreme of charting every transac-
tion in a stock or group of stocks, the latter being termed the transaction, or ticker,
chart.
Breaking up the Daily Time Interval
The first practical break-down of the daily charting interval is naturally the hourly
chart. In such a chart the only difference in technique is that the separate intervals of
the pictorial trading record charted are the hour instead of the day. In other words,
the hourly chart shows both a price and volume line for each hour of trading instead
of for each separate day of trading.
In theory at least, the patterns which form on an hourly chart have the same sig-
nificance as they would have on a daily chart, except that we should, of course,
expect the movements arising therefrom to be small in extent in proportion to the
size of the patterns. One phenomenon of price action – the Gap – which has its dis-
tinct uses in forecasting from daily charts, may safely be assumed to have little or no
forecasting value when it appears between the price ranges of two hours within the
same trading day. Occurring at that particular time, which we have selected arbi-
trarily for charting purposes, it could have no more and no less significance, obvi-
ously, than a sudden price change coming any time inside any hourly period, in
which event it would not show as a Gap on our chart. An over-night price Gap,
appearing on a daily or an hourly chart, has a psychological influence, besides rep-
resenting an accumulation of technical strength or weakness during the interval
when the market is closed, but the Gaps which may show up on an hourly chart

within a day’s session have no such psychological or accumulative influence.
However, we need not devote any more space to a consideration of hourly charts.
It must be quite apparent to the student that they offer little or nothing of value to
the average trader. The scalper or quick-turn artist, who is interested primarily in
capturing small profits on the minor fluctuations within the day, might find an
hourly chart of some assistance but he would have to watch both the tape and the
clock all day, noting every transaction in his list of stocks and making his entries at
the end of every hour.
The Ticker or Transaction Chart
The extreme break-down of the time interval is naturally the transaction or ticker
chart, in which the transactions are really not grouped according to time at all but in
which each transaction, with price and volume, is charted on a space of its own. In
between the hourly chart and the ticker chart, are the half-hour interval, the fifteen
minute interval, or any time interval we may desire to use, the only important
requirement being that the time interval be consistent throughout each individual
chart. A corruption of the ticker chart is the 200-share transaction chart, in which the
100 share transactions are ignored and only those charted which involve more than
this basic unit of trading. This results in considerable saving of time, space and
energy but does not appear theoretically to be as precise or valuable as the basic
ticker chart.
It is easy to see that these break-downs of the daily time interval involve much
additional labor, especially as we progress down to the transaction, or ticker, chart,
which records every individual transaction, with price and volume. A graphic
record of every transaction in a stock has its points of interest perhaps to the spe-
cialist, and to the theorist in research, but certainly can be of little value to the prac-
tical trader.
The Minor-Move Chart
Another alternative of the ticker chart is one which may well be called the Minor
Move chart since it has certain practical advantages in affording a good picture of
minor intra-day movements without requiring the patience and detail of the ticker
chart. It is made by drawing a vertical line on the price chart to show the extent of
each minor move in either direction until the price, as recorded on the ticker,
reverses this direction by moving a certain set distance back and away from the
extreme price of the previous direction. Any basis of reversal may be selected, the
usual ones being from a half point to three points. When the previous minor move-
ment is thus reversed, a horizontal line is drawn from the extreme of the preceding
– 388–

movement, to the right and on to the next vertical space. Then the new minor move
in the reversed direction is noted by another vertical line extending in the opposite
direction, until that new movement is, in turn, reversed, when the process of chart-
ing is repeated.
In other words, if we decide on a minor move basis of one full point, and our stock
opens the day at 50 and proceeds down to 49, we draw a vertical line from 50 to 49.
If it goes back up to 497/8we take no action on the chart because the reverse move-
ment has been less so far than our selected unit of one full point from the extreme of
the previous movement. But, if it then goes down to 481/8we continue our original
vertical line down to that price level. If the stock now recovers to 491/8, however, our
minor move has reversed. From the extreme of 481/8, we draw a short horizontal line
across to the next vertical space, and then draw our new minor move line from 481/8
to 491/8, and so on. This type of Minor Move chart gives a fairly accurate picture of
intra-day movements, but it does not lend itself easily to the notation of the time ele-
ment, and precludes the charting of volume.
The Minor Trend Line Chart
One variant of the Minor Move Chart, which also takes into account only price
movements of pre-determined extent, differs only in the method employed in draw-
ing the lines denoting the significant price changes and may be called the Minor
Trend chart. Using the same data, for example, which we used in the previous para-
graph to explain the Minor Move chart, we would start our chart at 50 and draw a
diagonal line down to the 481/8 level on the next vertical cross-section line to the
right, then draw a diagonal line from that point to the 491/8level on the next vertical
cross-section line, and so on.
Both the Minor Move and Minor Trend chart have the same limited use and the
same decided disadvantages for the practical trader, besides making it necessary to
keep or buy every day an accurate record of all the transactions in every stock
charted.
Point and Figure Charts
One other corruption of the ticker chart is quite similar to the Minor Move chart
except that symbols or the actual price figures are written into the chart itself instead
of drawing short vertical and horizontal lines. This type of chart has many names
but it is usually known as the Figure chart or the Point chart. The general scheme is
open to varying details of personal taste and policy, but if we accept the previous
example of noting only one-point moves, as in the case of the Minor Move chart,
then we should write in any consistent symbol or, more generally, the exact figure,

50, in our first vertical column and on a level with that price on the horizontal price
scale. As the stock declined to 49 we should write that figure, 49, in at its proper level
just under the 50 figure.
Following the same data, however, we should not enter the 48 symbol in this same
vertical column because the decline was reversed at 481/8 before it reached the 48
level. When this reversal did occur we would simply begin a new column in the next
vertical space, starting with the base figure of 49 and continuing to build up through
each whole number of the advance until the next reversal was reached.
Point, or Figure, charts may be constructed for any scale of minor movement we
care to select, using half-point, point, 3-point, or 5-point moves as our minimum
unit, for example, but here again the picture does not lend itself to volume or time
notations. Over a sufficient time interval some of our familiar technical formations
will develop quite satisfactorily on such charts, and are susceptible to the usual
analysis and forecasting deductions except that, as we have noted, we are deprived
of the extremely important aid of the volume factor. Gaps also are not shown. Cer-
tain specialized measuring formulae are sometime applied to Point or Figure charts
for use in short-swing forecasting but these measuring formulae seem to work out
in practice somewhat less accurately than the general measuring rules which we
have previously studied in connection with vertical line charts.
Limitations of Point or Figure Charts
Like the other types of Minor Move and Minor Time interval charts which we have
examined in the foregoing paragraphs, the Point or Figure chart requires taking
from the tape a complete record of every transaction in the stocks charted, or the
daily purchase of this data from statistical organizations who make a business of
supplying it. Since Point or Figure charts show only those price movements which
equal or exceed the pre-determined minimum which is used as the basis for chart-
ing, they do not, naturally, show all of the daily price ranges in most cases. If a Fig-
ure chart is being constructed on a 3-point basis, for example, the price may range
as much as 27/8 beyond the last recorded point on the chart, without this excess
movement’s ever being noted thereon. On a single point chart a movement of 7/8of
a point may be disregarded in the same way. It may be argued that price movements
less in extent than the movement which is originally taken as the basis for figure
charting should have no significance in interpreting the market, but we have found
that this is by no means always the case. Small movements may be highly signifi-
cant, especially when they are considered with relation to the attendant volume.
After a very considerable study and application of Point or Figure charts, we have
been obliged to conclude that they offer the practical trader no advantages over the
ordinary vertical line chart. In extremely rare cases they have signalled a quick

reversal following a rapid, almost ‘‘vertical’’ advance of unusual extent which
occurred without developing much of a pattern, except perhaps exhaustion volume,
on the daily vertical line chart. But, even in those exceptional cases, it would have
been necessary for the trader to sit at the ticker and post his chart as each transaction
came over the tape in order to get the reversal signal in time to profit by it. Moreover,
movements such as these, spectacular though they may be, during the few days in
which they occur, are rather dangerous playthings for the ordinary trader. When
they occur in a stock in which the trader already has a long position the judicious
moving up of stop loss orders during the advance affords ample protection for prof-
its. On the other hand, many significant phenomena of forecasting value appear
constantly on the vertical line charts which never show at all on Figure charts.
Only Specialized Value for Intra-day Charts
Although we do not recommend these various types of intra-day and special Minor
Move chart to the average technical student, it is only part of his thorough education
to know what they are and how they are constructed. It is easy to see, first, that their
operation requires not only a tremendous amount of additional labor, but also the
chartist’s presence in the brokerage board-room, hanging over the ticker throughout
the entire day’s trading, or at least poring over the transaction records after the close
to glean the material for his ultra-detailed chart.
In the second place, we know from experience that the average student or trader
does not get a great deal out of such charts, and certainly fails to get value com-
mensurate with the additional time and other disadvantages involved. In special-
ized cases the intra-day chart can prove important and valuable for very short-term
forecasting or scalping operations but for the average chart trader they can be almost
as confusing as useful – almost as misleading, in overly magnifying the importance
of very short intermediate moves, as the previously condemned practice of watch-
ing the ticker itself.
Wherever they are used, however, it is highly important that the intra-day charts
be used merely as an accessory to the daily chart, for the latter continues to be the
fundamental basis for our practical analysis of technical movements, and really the
only basis required, in fact, in ordinary trading operations.
Other Special Lines of Chart Research
For many years, as the reader may well imagine, the stock market has been the sub-
ject of intensive study and research which has extended into every conceivable
graphic and mathematical method of interpreting its action. The student who
wishes can find almost endless fields for further exploration. Moving averages,

USE OF LONG-TERM CHARTS, AVERAGES AND GROUPS
oscillators, ratio calculations, breadth of market factors, etc. – all have their protag-
onists. Their study is interesting, even fascinating, for one who has the time to
devote to it, but their practical value is, to say the least, very questionable in actual
trading operations. It is our experience that they nearly always lead to confusion
and indecision rather than to profitable action.
In this Course we have concentrated on those practical, well demonstrated and
easily applied methods of interpreting the technical action of the market which, if
conscientiously employed with common sense and judgment, will bring reasonable
profits with safety. We have avoided the untested and the purely academic – the
‘‘interesting if true’’ theories – the more or less esoteric studies which do not permit
of practical forecasting conclusions in time to permit of profitable trading action.
The methods of technical analysis taught herein do not entail subscribing to any con-
tinuing ‘‘service’’ for data or analysis. They demand of the trader only a reasonable
amount of time and thought – such as he should devote to any serious business
involving the same amount of capital risk and opportunity for profit.
THE CHARTING OF OTHER TRADING MEDIUMS
At the very beginning of our course we noted that most of our rules of technical
action, while applied directly to the study in hand, may also be applied to other
fields, insofar as such rules spring from varying aspects of a universal type of action
resulting from the two opposing factors of supply and demand.
While the stock market is probably the most specialized, practical and profitable
field for charting and chart theory, still its general logic may consistently be applied
to all other markets where the price movements we wish to study are a result of free
and open trading, allowing full sway to the conflicting forces.
The Bond Market
The bond market, for instance, presents itself as a fairly satisfactory medium for
charts and chart theory, even though the limitation of trading, lack of speculative
operations and professional campaigns as well as the comparative absence of short
selling, reduce the efficacy of chart theories to a substantial minimum. Such factors
operate not only to present too simple pictures and too few patterns, but they tend
also to limit the swings of bond price and to keep trading at a lower volume than in
stocks, both results being disadvantageous for chart operation. Furthermore, of
course, the greater investment stability inherent in the bond itself is a restraining fac-
tor in wide price swings and thus in potential market profits.
The bond market does not lend itself, therefore, to the application of technical
chart action nearly so well or profitably as does the stock market, but the underly-

ing principles apply none the less, and bond charts are not only practicable but fairly
common and often highly useful to the interested
trader, as well as to the bond dealer and investor.

would ordinarily be practicable on the chart of a
stock selling at the same level. The larger scale com-
pensates for the normally narrow price swings in the bond market.
An Example of Bond Chart Action
A chart of the price movements in a typical high-grade railroad bond is pictured in
Fig. XI.5. This shows the price and volume action in New York Central’s Refunding
41/2% bonds of 2013, for the last half of 1936, arranged on a scale which depicts most
clearly the patterns which developed therein. Starting on July 9, the price advanced
in a ‘‘mast’’ from 87 to 891/2around which level a compact pattern of congestion was
built with volume tending to decline in the process, giving us a Half-mast formation
that called for a further advance to around 92. This forecast was, in fact, carried out
in less than three weeks and at least partial profit-taking was suggested at that level
by the Half-mast implications. The first minor trend line was broken by the decline
on August 21, but the price action on the 24th left behind it an Island, forecasting a
renewal of the up-trend, and a new purchase if we had closed out our previous long
position. The price action from September 8 to 16 suggested a Flag, although the
break-out on the up side on the 17th was not accompanied by an increase in volume.
The ensuing advance gave validity to the Flag, however, and called for another halt
(by the application again of our measuring rules) to around 951/2, at which point
profit-taking, at least on a part of our commitment, was again in order.
In the meantime the August 22 bottom gave us a new point across which to con-
struct a trend line, with a parallel secondary line across the previous tops. The reces-
sion which formed the Flag touched the trend line on September 16 but did not
violate it, and the price range on September 23 reached the upper line and was fol-
lowed by a reaction as we might have anticipated on the basis of trend action alone.
On October 17, however, the trend line was penetrated slightly and prices moved
sidewise until the 21st when a further recession indicated that the trend had been
decisively broken.
A third trend line was drawn across the October 26 bottom and when it was vio-
lated, a coming reversal in the major trend was strongly suggested. This indication
was further confirmed by the fact that the December rally did not succeed in getting
back above the third ‘‘fan’’ of the trend line by a decisive margin.

Charting the Commodity Markets
The freer commodity markets are much more fertile fields than the bond market for
the additional application of charts and technical forecasting theories. These mar-
kets come much closer to our ideal state of free and open speculative trading cen-
ters. They present the necessary interplay of conflicting forces resulting in faster
price movement. They offer a much wider sphere of speculative interest, are open to
purely professional operations and speculative campaigns, generally allow short
selling with operation consequently possible on both sides of the market, and are
characterized by much wider and more profitable swings than the bond market.
Wheat, corn, rye, oats, cotton, wool, sugar, copper, rubber, coffee, cocoa – in short
the entire list of open-market trading commodities – are more or less favorable fields
for chart operation. But it is not the individual commodity itself which determines
the practicability of chart application. It is rather the nature of the market for that
specific commodity, the kind of trading, the activity, the availability of necessary
data, the characteristic extent of major swings, and other fairly apparent considera-
tions, which determine the theoretical value which the application of charts might
offer. And it may be generally observed that the closer such characteristics approxi-
mate to the almost ideal standards present in stock market trading, the more accu-
rate and profitable will chart application be found in each individual market.
The wheat and cotton markets are perhaps the ones most commonly studied and
interpreted by means of charts, due largely to their superiority in many of the points
just mentioned. Both are large, important and profitable markets. They include free
and open trading, heavy volume of activity, short selling, the opportunity for spec-
ulative campaigns, and, finally, are generally characterized by wide and profitable
price swings.
Charts Interrupted by Exploration of Different Options
One complication that arises in the charting of wheat and cotton, as well as certain
other commodities, results from the conflict or spread between the various future
delivery dates, which come and go as almost separate markets. In Wheat, for exam-
ple, it is possible on any given date to trade in three different ‘‘options’’. In Novem-
ber one may buy or sell Wheat for the December, May or July delivery, on the
Chicago, Winnipeg or Kansas City markets. When the May option is closed, i.e.
when trading ceases in Wheat for May delivery, the December option is opened and
trading commences in Wheat for delivery the following December. When the July
option is closed, the market for delivery in May of the next year is opened. On any
given date September Wheat may be selling for five cents a bushel more or less than

USE OF LONG-TERM CHARTS, AVERAGES AND GROUPS
July Wheat. In the case of Cotton, trading is carried on simultaneously in eleven dif-
ferent options or future delivery dates.
(It must be assumed that the student will take steps to acquaint himself – if he is
not already informed – on the mechanics of the commodity markets, and the nature
of the contracts to deliver or take delivery which are the actual basis of trading,
before he undertakes to make use of charts in commodity market operations. He will
have to learn about spreads, squeezes, switching, etc. This knowledge, however, is
not essential to our present discussion of charting and chart analysis.)
Different Methods of Charting Options
As a consequence of this simultaneous trading activity in different future deliveries,
the chartist is faced with a problem which does not arise in the charting of securities.
The simplest, and often the most practical, method of chart operation is to treat each
developing option as a separate and distinct market. Each of his charts on Wheat
then will run for only seven to ten months depending on the option, and he has the
choice of maintaining one, two, or three different charts at any given time, and may
regard each as a different trading medium just as he would regard the charts of three
different stocks. This procedure, however, has the disadvantage of failing to provide
the long-range continuity which we have found so valuable in the analysis of stock
charts.
A first step in providing this continuity and broader view of the general market in
a commodity like Wheat is accomplished by charting all the different open and
active future options on one large sheet, using different colored inks or crayons to
distinguish the different options. Green, for example, may be used for May, red for
July, blue for September, and black for December. As each old or spot option passes
out of the picture, the new future, and most distant, option is added to the chart.
Owing to mechanical limitation on the use of color in reproducing these lessons, we
are unable to show a chart of this type, but the method is, we trust, perfectly under-
standable.
Another, somewhat less complete and useful but much simpler expedient is to
chart only one option at a time, usually the nearest future delivery, dropping each
old option on or before the first day of its delivery month and carrying right on from
that point with the next option. The December delivery, for example, in Wheat may
be charted through November 30, then the May delivery through April 30, and so
on. A chart prepared on this plan for about eight months from June 6, 1936 through
January 30, 1937, is reproduced in Fig. XI.6 showing price and volume of transac-
tions on the Chicago Board of Trade. The spreads between the prices of the two dif-
ferent options at the time that the change is made from one to the other on the chart
will occasionally confuse or break the continuity of the picture to some extent, but

USE OF LONG-TERM CHARTS, AVERAGES AND GROUPS
normally this spread is small, the switching operations of traders as well as the nat-
ural laws of supply and demand tending to produce a close conformance.
Averaging All Active Options
Perhaps the soundest of all methods for those who have the time and the facilities,
as well as the desire to study the market intensively, is to carry along one master
chart of the price movements of all open and active future options averaged
together. This master control chart offers the desirable continuity for practical study
and longer-term operations, and may be used as a valuable guide not only in eval-
uating the general market but also in connection with the smaller and shorter charts
on the individual options, which are maintained at the same time so long as each
remains extant.
The preparation and upkeep of such a master chart requires more calculation and
labor than the average stock chart for it must consist in somewhat of a running aver-
age of all options. As each old, or spot, option expires the new future option is added
into the average to replace it, and thus a satisfactory and continuous average of the
general market is made possible and practical.
Charting the Different Markets or Exchanges
In addition to the complications introduced by the concurrent trading in different
future delivery options, the trader in Wheat is also faced with the problem of decid-
ing how many and which of the great grain markets he should follow. Wheat futures
are traded on the open markets of Chicago, Minneapolis, Duluth and Kansas City,
for example, in this country. Of these the Chicago market (Board of Trade) is the
largest and most important. Kansas City is generally considered to rank next in
importance, especially as a cash market. The Winnipeg market in Canada is large
and active, subject to fewer restrictions and consequently more sensitive to world
wide influences than any of our domestic exchanges. Liverpool is the premier Wheat
market of the world. Most traders carry on their active operations on only one of
these exchanges but find it advisable to follow one or more of the others. Official
volume figures are ordinarily obtainable only on the Chicago market.
Close Relation Between Prices of Different Grains
Just as different stocks may be affected and carried up or down together by general
financial and industrial tides, so, different grains are influenced to some extent by
the same set of general conditions. Moreover, if Wheat, for example, goes up in

price, Corn may be purchased and used in its place for many purposes. A dearth of
one kind of grain is reflected in an increased demand for other kinds. Thus the Corn
market affects the Wheat market and vice-versa, and both may affect the Rye and
Oats market in so far as one may be consumed in place of the other. Consequently,
the active trader in Wheat usually finds it advisable to chart and watch the action of
corn and the other grains, applying the developments on those charts in his analy-
sis and forecasts of the Wheat charts.
Formations Appearing on the Wheat Chart
Returning now to the Wheat chart in Fig. XI.6, we may observe some of the familiar
patterns which appear thereon. Note first that our chart is based to begin with on the
trading in the July option to the end of June, then the September option to August
19, then the December option to December 28, and then the May option to January
30. The volume of trading in each option tends normally to decline as the delivery
month is approached, and this normal habit must be taken into account when inter-
preting the volume record. Our chart has been transferred to the next option in each
case as trading in the nearby delivery became relatively inactive.
We have first, from June 23 to June 30, a good Flag pattern formed on a mast which
extended from around 85 to 97, and was followed by another rapid advance from 94
to around 110. The price action from July 13 to July 27 gave us a minor down-trend
line which was broken on the up-side on July 29, with a marked increase in volume.
There was also the suggestion of a Symmetrical Triangle at that point. The recession
on August 11 met support at the level of the July 16 top. The recession at the end of
August carried prices back down to the support level of the late July break-out
before it was reversed and the upward trend resumed, carrying the price to 117 on
September 24.
A Continuation Triangle and a Measuring Gap
From that date to November 14 we have a long, thin Symmetrical Triangle, with a
decisive break-out on the up-side on November 16. Note the increased volume
attending the break-out, also the subsequent minor reaction on shrinking volume to
the support level of the extended top side of the Triangle, which formed a cradle
with the long-term trend line at that point. The Continuation Gap between Decem-
ber 12 and 14 permitted the application of our Measuring Gap formula which called
for a further advance to the 133–137 zone. The reaction from the top around 137
early in January, and the failure of the subsequent rally to reach the previous high,
gave us a Head and Shoulders formation with an upward slanting neck-base line
which was broken with an increase in volume on January 19. The ensuing decline

was halted, however, at the logical support level of the top of the Gap made in mid-
December.
The long major-up-trend line drawn across the bottoms of July 18 and September
2 had not been broken at the time of this chart’s completion. Subsequently, Wheat
made a small Head and Shoulders bottom at the trend line; the neck-base line of this
pattern was broken with increased volume on February 3, with a Break-Away Gap
at the 128 level; and the price had advanced to around 138 at the time this Study
went to press.
Basic Formations and Interpretations Unchanged
We would not have the reader believe that the Wheat chart we have just analyzed is
the ideal type of chart upon which to undertake operations on the Chicago Board of
Trade. But it has no doubt served to demonstrate the fact that the same formations
whose forecasting value we have learned to recognize on stock charts are developed
on grain market charts as well, and have the same significance, being produced by
the same free interplay of the forces of supply and demand. The factors which pro-
duce technical changes in the market for stocks operate similarly in the grain mar-
kets and create similar pictures on the charts. And just as is the case with stocks, the
grain charts present a composite picture of the net result of all the opinions, hopes,
fears and knowledge (published and unpublished) pertaining to supply and
demand which govern the trend of prices. If we can translate the chart picture into
a reasonable forecast of the likely future trend we do not need to concern ourselves
with the basic causes; the chart has weighed and evaluated them for us.
Charting the Cotton Market
In general the methods and principles we have discussed in connection with the
Wheat market apply as well to the technical analysis of the Cotton market. Contracts
for the future delivery of cotton are traded in this country on the New York and New
Orleans Cotton Exchanges and, in smaller volume, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The Liverpool Exchange is the principal foreign market. The average American
trader will find it necessary to chart only one market – either the New York or New
Orleans, depending on his location and personal preference. Official volume of
transactions is not recorded or published on any of the exchanges so we are obliged
to get along without this very useful aid in interpreting the price action.
Cotton may be purchased or sold for future delivery any month of the year, the
market for January of the following year being opened as soon as the spot market
for January of the current year is closed. Thus each individual option remains open
for eleven months. Not all of the different months’ options are actively traded, how-

ever. The January, March, May, July, October and December deliveries are normally
the most important in speculative and hedging operations and are, as a rule, the only
ones on which complete price reports are published in the daily papers. Final deliv-
ery date on futures contracts is the seventh business day before the end of the
month, and trading is closed on the notice date which is five business days (exclud-
ing Saturdays) before delivery date.
An Example of Cotton Market Charting
The various methods of charting the general market which were suggested in con-
nection with Wheat, may be applied also to Cotton. The chart in Fig. XI.7 shows the
price action of the 1937 March, July and January Cotton deliveries during the last
half of 1936 on the New York Exchange. The March delivery is charted at the top of
the page, July in the middle, and January at the bottom, each on its own scale. The
chart is too short to give us any indication of long-term trends, but minor trends
appear quite plainly defined. The student will find upon close examination Islands,
Triangles and other of our familiar technical patterns.
The close conformance of the trends in the three options on this chart, comparing
one with the other, is most conspicuous. This should be expected, of course, since the
only respect in which they differ is in the date of delivery. Any tendency on the part
of one option to depart from conformity with the other active options in price action,
should be regarded with suspicion; in other words, until a certain break-out of for-
mation or reversal in trend in one option is confirmed by a similar break-out or
reversal in one or more other options, it should not be made the basis for a forecast
or a commitment. For example, note in our chart of the July option the Triangle
formed by the price ranges from September 8 to October 13, with a break-out on the
up-side on October 16. We had no volume to guide us in appraising the reliability of
this break-out but certainly it had all the other earmarks of a true movement calling
for higher prices. Comparing the July with the March and January option charts,
however, we could see that no advance in prices had been signalled on either of the
latter. The logical assumption then was that the break-out on the July chart should
be regarded as a false move, at least until such time as the other options confirmed
it. This example emphasizes the advantages of maintaining either a control charge
of the average of all the open options in a single commodity, or else individual con-
current charts of at least several of the active open options.

however, that out brief consideration of commodity charting will serve as an intro-

TRADING TACTICS
Practical Trading on Chart Formations
Through the application of our individual patterns of longer-term pictures we have
progressed in our study of technical market science from the separate observation of
fundamental pictures, theories, and rules, toward our ideal objective of a broad
background for successful analysis of the constantly unfolding pictorial record and
for more advanced application of our knowledge in practical market trading.
Having mastered these fundamentals, completion of the student’s education in
technical forecasting and scientific trading lies largely within the scope of his own
continued initiative and interest and in the experience which comes only from his
own conscientious application, observation and study of additional chart records for
himself.
Some Aids In Practical Trading
As we prepare to leave the reader to his own devices, however, we may take a little
further time to observe some of the more important and more profitable rules and
theories which apply directly to the practical use of our chart knowledge in actual
market trading.
We have already stated one of the most important of these practical trading rules
with regard to both long-swing and short-turn trading with the charts as a broad
background. For the trader, the rule is to trade mostly along with the confirmed
major trend, rather than switching his position to try for every suggested inter-
mediate movement contrary to that trend. Its corollary is to give always the balance
of doubt to the side of the major move, and to resist mentally the temptation to antic-
ipate one’s wishes for a major turn. The trader is always justified in taking small
profits and in playing in and out of the market but the point is that in such short-turn
trading he must never lose sight of the direction of the major movement, for in that
direction lie his best chances for profit.
For the long-swing investor, the rule is compromise and gradual shifting of one’s
line. Here, too, it is even more definitely advisable,
of course, to play along in the direction of the major

the theory that neither accumulation or distribution

==================================================

STUDY XII
Selection of Operating Stocks
Selection of the best individual stocks to buy and sell will come gradually, as a rule,
from experience and practical observation. The student will find that he accumu-
lates certain ‘‘pet’’ issues for various reasons, perhaps because they constitute his
longest chart records, perhaps because they offer more perfect patterns, perhaps
because he has always been interested in the stock, or perhaps because his forecasts
have worked out more profitably in such stocks than in others he has tried.
Such an accumulation of a ‘‘pet’’ list is quite logical and proper, provided it does
not lead into stubbornness, into overtrading, into lack of proper diversification or
into a narrow point of view which fails to retain an open mind and a keen inquisi-
tiveness into all other charts, or which keeps one from watching for more favorable
developments elsewhere.
Having pet stocks is all right, therefore, if it is not carried to an extreme either in
time duration or trading volume. If this tendency is carried to an extreme, the stu-
dent will not only fail to see other better opportunities and find his capital tied up in
profitless situations, but he will gradually find himself going stale on his ‘‘pet’’
stocks, with resultant false analysis and loss. Why this ‘‘staleness’’ should result is
hard to explain yet every veteran trader has experienced it. Obviously, the proper
course then is to drop the ‘‘pet’’ stocks from active trading, turn the attention to a
broader list and concentrate on other issues for a while at least.
Diversification of Risk
Diversification of risk is also an important factor in practical chart trading. It is
hoped that the reader is by this time not merely convinced of the usefulness of chart
patterns but is also quite conscious of their fallibility and sudden reversal. One
proper and practical means of turning these two opposing truths to profit is the
diversification and limiting of individual risk. The average trader, almost without
exception, might better trade in 25-share lots of four different stocks, even though
commissions and taxes are higher, rather than confine his operations to 100 shares
of only a single stock. And still better if his four stocks are selected from four differ-
ent groups. The wisdom of this course is perfectly obvious, yet it is strangely uncom-
mon in practice. The trader must constantly fight any inclination to overtrade in
single stocks, as well as in the general market. At the opposite extreme, and equally
to be avoided, of course, is the dilution of one’s trading capital and attention among
too many different issues.

TRADING TACTICS
Comparative Swing Power of Stocks
One very useful factor to keep in mind when making up a list of stocks to chart with
a view to trading in them, is the relative ‘‘swing’’ habits of different groups and of
the individual issues in each group. That certain stocks tend habitually to swing
both up and down in greater movements, percentage-wise, than others, is a fact well
known to experienced traders. Certain issues are notoriously sluggish and disap-
pointing in their price movements, year after year, while others are most spectacu-
lar in their ups and downs. Few traders, however, appreciate how remarkably
consistent stocks are in their swing habits, and how accurately their relative
swing power can be computed from a study of their market history over a term of
years.
Careful analysis of the swing habits of a large number of stocks often produces
some rather surprising results. It develops, for example, that certain stocks popu-
larly regarded as having characteristically wide and rapid movements, actually
offer less profitable opportunities on a percentage basis than others which do not
ordinarily attract much public attention. And others, commonly regarded as
‘‘doggy’’, really present excellent percentage movements. The swing power of a
stock depends on a number of factors, most important of which is the nature of the
industry. Certain industries are little affected, comparatively speaking, by general
business conditions. Others fall into the ‘‘feast or famine’’ class, profiting enor-
mously in times of general prosperity and suffering equally conspicuous deficits
when business is depressed. Certain companies, by virtue of a more elastic organi-
zation, abler management or lower fixed overhead charges, are better able to adapt
themselves to changing business conditions than others. Seasonal business trends
produce marked ups and downs in the profits of some corporations and this condi-
tion is reflected in the wide swings of their stocks.
Capitalization and Leverage Factors
Stocks of which a comparatively small number of shares are outstanding move
faster as a rule than those of larger issues. And this condition is further affected by
the floating supply – the number of shares, that is, which are ordinarily available for
purchase or sale in the market. The leverage factor is also of importance. The com-
mon shares of a corporation which has no outstanding bonds or preferred stock,
appreciate or depreciate theoretically in exact proportion as the earning power of the
company increases or decreases. If, on the other hand, a company has a large funded
debt and preferred stock on which it must pay interest and dividends at a fixed rate
before the common stock receives any share of the profits, the leverage factor comes

markedly into play and the common stock advances or declines at a faster rate than
the total profits of the company.
Study the Habits of your Stocks
But over and above the natural and more or less predictable factors affecting stock
price movements, there are differences in swing power between individual issues
which are attributable only to intangible trading habits. The student will learn in
time, if he studies carefully the characteristic movements of his stocks, in terms of
percent rather than points or dollars, which of them can be depended upon to return
him the greater profits on a given investment.
Consistency of Swing Habits Illustrated
The relative swing power of two different stocks in the same industrial group is
graphically portrayed in Fig. XII.1. The two stocks whose gains and losses have been
charted thereon are Otis Steel and United States Steel, and their action compared
with the concurrent average action of their group of 17 steel stocks. The successive
important price advances and declines of US Steel from June, 1932 to June, 1936, are
indicated by the solid vertical lines. The advances and declines of Otis Steel at the
same time are indicated by the dotted vertical lines.
The zero line on this chart represents the price level from which the group aver-
age started each up or down market movement during the period covered. The
upper 100 line represents in each case the price level to which the group average
attained on the advances, and the lower 100 line the price level to which the group
average fell on each decline. In other words, each movement of the average is taken
as 100% and the relative movements of the two individual issues are thus compared
with the action of the group as a whole on a straight percentage basis.
For example, the first advance of the group after June, 1932, took their average
price up 155% above their level at the start. This, for the sake of comparison, is con-
sidered 100 on the graph. At the same time, US Steel advanced from 21 to 45, an
increase of 114% from its starting level; but Otis Steel advanced 192% from its start-
ing level. As compared with the group action, therefore, 124%. Consequently, the
solid line representing US Steel extends up only to 73, while the dotted line repre-
senting Otis Steel extends to 124.
The same method has been used in extending the lines for each ensuing decline
and advance. It will be noted that the percentage movement of Otis Steel in every
case but one (the first intermediate decline) was greater than US Steel; also that it
was in all but four out of 34 movements better than the average for the group. US
Steel in every case moved less percentage-wise than the group average. The consis-

tency of these performances through 34 price advances and declines over a period
of four years may surprise the student but it is, in no sense, extraordinary. Similar
results appear in a study of almost all stocks that have been listed long enough to
give a statistical base for computation.
Obviously, the comparison of the relative gain and loss power of US Steel and Otis
Steel, suggests that the trader would find it more profitable to chart and to trade in
the latter.
Relative Swing Power of Two Rail Stocks
Generally speaking, there seems to be a correlation between price level and swing
power. Stocks which sell at high price levels tend to move within a narrower range
in terms of percent than do stocks selling at low prices. This is not always apparent
to the casual observer who sees Case, for example, go up or down 6 to 10 points in
a few days but does not convert this price change into percentage movement. There
are plenty of exceptions to the rule, however. One such is illustrated by Fig. XII.2,
which shows the movements of Southern Railway and Canadian Pacific as com-
pared with the average movements of their group – the Railroads. The important
advances and declines of the average price of 28 railroad stocks from June, 1932 to
June, 1936 is taken in each case as 100, and the advances and declines which South-
ern Railway and Canadian Pacific made at the same time are expressed graphically
as percentages of the group movement. Southern Railway is represented by the dot-
ted line and Canadian Pacific by the solid line. In this example it will be seen that the
higher-priced stock, Southern Railway, shows consistently greater swing power.
Poor Stocks to Chart
Charting experience will also teach the careful student which stocks do not make
good patterns with sufficient frequency to lend safe guidance in trading. Generally
speaking, ‘‘thin’’ issues with a small floating supply or an inactive market, do not
make distinct patterns and are more easily manipulated by inside operators con-
trary to chart indications. Also very high-priced issues are apt to make less prof-
itable movements in terms of percentage, as we have stated above in our discussion
of swing power. On the other hand, very low-priced issues are apt to make big
moves, percentage-wise, in a single day and then move sidewise for a long and
patience-trying period – a habit which renders them poor subjects for chart trading.
Other things being equal, stocks in the middle price ranges give the most satisfac-
tory chart results.

STUDY XII
Don’t Force Chart Pictures
Having selected and charted a number of stocks for a few months, and sometimes
even for only a few weeks, the beginner is apt to be led by his enthusiasm for the
subject into seeing technical patterns where none in
fact exist. This brings up another important rule of

formations. The student will recall that we have
sometimes used considerable imagination in sug-
gesting various indefinite patterns in our previous observations on particular charts,
especially the monthly charts in this chapter, but that is quite different from risking
actual cash upon such suggestions.
If the indefinite patterns simply confirm the forecast of a definite one, then trad-
ing commitments are justified, but the student is never justified in actually trading
on the basis of what slightly resembles a specific formation. Chart trading is by
no means infallible even on nearly perfect patterns, without adding the risk
which arises from careless or wishful analysis through the aid of an active imagina-
tion.
Wait for the Ideal Situation
Exercise of the imagination is quite logical in theoretical analysis but when practical
trading commitments are at stake let the student wait for the ideal situation. For
instance, the practical student will find days, weeks, even months, passing by, in cer-
tain individual cases, without a chart presenting any sort of a pattern or formation
definite enough to justify an actual trading commitment. His patience will thus be
sorely tried at times but it is almost self-evident that patience is a prime requisite and
that it is far better to wait for the ideal situation than to rush into actual cash com-
mitments merely through a desire for action when the situation is not strong enough
or definite enough to warrant it.
Practical profits are often possible during the process of building formations, but
by far the more certain and larger profits are made in the rapid moves in the direc-
tion of the major trend which come between these area formations or preparation
periods. It is much better to be patient, to restrain one’s ambition for profits, and to
stay out of the market entirely when no perfect patterns appear for a time, rather
than to become impatient and rush in enthusiastically on less than ideal situations.
Too hasty action often leads to eventual loss of profits, capital and confidence.

TRADING TACTICS
Remember the old traders’ adage: ‘‘There are three rules for making money in the
stock market. They are (1) Patience, (2) Patience, and (3) More Patience.
Too Close Contact with Market Inadvisable
In our occasional references up to now to actual market action taken on technical
forecasts, it has been inferred that all trades were to be executed at the opening on
the morning following the completed chart picture, or the trading decision. For the
normal and average student trader this is unques-
tionably the best procedure. In all our chart study
Three rules for making

the scalper, may watch the minor moves of the mar-
ket during the day’s trading and may derive benefit
therefrom in the form of better opportunities for catching sharp swings during the
day when they are just getting under way. But the average chart student will seldom
if ever lose very much by holding himself aloof from constant communication with
the ticker and, indeed, he is much more likely to benefit by divorcing himself from
the excitement, the conversation, the gossip, the impetuosities, and the nerve strain,
which emanate from watching the erratic fluctuations within the day’s market from
the dubious vantage point of the board-room. Many professional operators are past
masters in the art of so splitting or bunching their orders as to make the tape pro-
duce the effect they desire at a certain time of the day on the crowds who are watch-
ing it in the board-room.
The ideal aim of the chart student is to let the action of the market speak for itself
in forecasting its own technical position, and it is exceedingly difficult to assume the
calm open-mindedness necessary for such an ideal, while exposed to the psycho-
logical tides of board-room gossip, news, hopes and fears.
Regular Time for Daily Chart Consideration
We have previously noted (in Study I) that it is well for the student to have one cer-
tain, regular and habitual time each day for making up his charts, preferably after
the close in the evening. He can then evaluate the day’s movements at his leisure,
bestowing as much or little time as seems necessary from the importance of the shift-
ing scene, and if he is not in close touch with his broker, he can make out his orders
in calm and unhurried serenity and mail them the same evening, to reach his broker
early the next morning.

STUDY XII
Limited vs. Market Orders
In our practical trading examples we have also assumed that orders are entered ‘‘at
the market’’ rather than at limit prices. We hold to no dogmatic theory or rule on this
point. There are plenty of occasions when it is more advisable to place limit orders
and to take the smaller chance of missing out on execution and possibly even on a
profitable move, rather than to take the larger chance of being caught by an over-
night spread, or a wide opening. Limit orders are generally advisable, of course, in
excited trading, where spreads are probable, or on important news breaking after
the close. They are also useful where the habitual, or probable, daily range is wide,
and where it seems logical that some time during the following day will see the price
temporarily at a more favorable level than is probable at the opening.
With such not so very common exceptions, however, it would seem to be the bet-
ter policy to trade at the market instead of with limit orders. The disappointments
and losses and errors of judgment which result from the failure of execution on limit
orders more than outweigh, in the long run, the small advantages which may
accrue. In the majority of cases the trader is not justified in trading at all unless he
can see the probability of a worthwhile move of at least four or five points.
It is manifestly foolish and illogical, therefore, for the trader to take a chance on
missing out entirely on this profitable move of many points merely on the chance
that he may save from a fraction to a point or so by placing a limit order instead of
a market order.
Intestinal Fortitude – a Word to the Naturally Conservative
In concluding our discussion of various practical suggestions for using our basic
chart knowledge: in actual trading, a word about ‘‘nerve’’ or intestinal fortitude may
not be out of place. We hesitate to address this portion of our observations to the
general mass of average readers because in most cases we find that the average stu-
dent is more apt to need words of caution and of restraint rather than encourage-
ment to action. But there is most certainly a definite type of individual who is so
conservative as to need a word or two on decision and initiative and action. Whether
fortunately or unfortunately, this class of personality is in the minority, but it may
frankly be stated that it is this class, also, which makes the most consistent success
in technical chart trading.
The student who has the innate character most favorable to profitable chart trad-
ing is the individual who will naturally attain to a conservative and skeptical atti-
tude toward all of our chart rules, and will therefore fear to tread where others, less
capable perhaps, rush in blindly and over-confidently to their ultimate loss. Though

TRADING TACTICS
those of careful and skeptical temperament are probably in the minority, they are the
successful minority, and our constant reiteration of caution, conservatism and mis-
trust of all technical rule and theory has probably struck in them a more responsive
chord than in the larger group for whom such admonitions are intended. This small,
conservative class of souls may therefore need to pay special attention to our final
advice of this study, which is the gospel of decisive action when conscientious study
has led to definite and sincerely grounded conclusions.
The Too Conservative Student
The conservative student will err on that side of his nature. He may, for that reason,
be more successful in the long run. But, contrary as it may seem, he must guard
against over-conservatism, against over-caution, against too much doubt and timid-
ity. The chief stumbling block for this type is his hesitation. He reasons out a per-
fectly clear and correct case for a certain type of direct and definite action. Then he
weighs the opposite possibilities too carefully, and decides to wait.
His market movement gets away from him. His judgment was correct but the
longer he procrastinates, the more hesitant he becomes, the more psychologically
uncertain, and the less likely to make profit from his correct analysis. The result of
such procrastination is not only a possible psychological upset but, in not uncom-
mon cases, the tendency finally to force himself to rush in without the usual careful
analysis and sound sense, at a time when the movement which was forecast with
proper logic some time ago, is just about over with, or is about to reverse itself for a
technical correction at least.
The Conservative vs. the Overconfident Type
The reader must decide for himself in which class he belongs, and he should have
no great difficulty in properly determining whether this advice is for him or for an
entirely different dispostion. If it is for him, then his aim should be to give direct and
prompt expression to the dictates of his study and analysis, once they have led him
to a basically sound conclusion.
The individual who is naturally conservative and calculating, will find a special
blessing in recourse to the stop-loss order. By using this type of protection whenever
he fears the upsetting of a conscientious and searching analysis, he may venture def-
inite action on his conviction, with the serenity that comes from knowing exactly
how much it is possible to lose in case the market does move unexpectedly in oppo-
sition to analytical conclusions.
We do not want to give the impression that the individual who cannot sincerely
place himself in this class of conservative or cautious traders is doomed to failure in

practical chart trading. Far from it. It merely happens that conservatism in moder-
ate doses is a propitious characteristic for market success, but conservatism may be
carried to profitless extremes just as easily as radicalism. A healthy mingling of deci-
siveness and conservatism is the ideal mixture for the successful trader, as for most
other careers as well.
The Danger of Stubborness
The decisiveness which we have recommended to the too conservative trader as a
desirable quality to cultivate should not, however, be carried to the extreme of over-
confidence or stubborn persistence in a decision which has been contraverted by
subsequent chart action. If the stock does not act according to one’s primary analy-
sis, then the market itself is trying to tell the trader to change that analysis.
One of the greatest fundamental mistakes which the chart trader can make is to
assume that success or failure is the result entirely of his own analysis. This is per-
haps true to a large degree but it is a dangerous attitude for it tends to make the
trader feel that the market movement rests upon him, upon his analysis, upon his
ideas of what should happen in the future, and thus it begets both over-confidence
and stubbornness. The successful trader should realize that his analysis has nothing
to do directly with market movement. It is not the trader telling the market what it
must do, but rather the market telling the trader. The market speaks constantly, and
through technical analysis the trader tries to interpret and understand the market’s
action and advice. But it is important always to realize that the market can change
its tone of converse at any moment and that preconceived notions based upon pre-
vious technical whisperings are distinctly out of place.
If the market action was the foundation of a tech-
nical forecast last week but has not acted in accor-

assume a stubborn attitude, of feeling that last
week’s analysis, however ideal and certain it
seemed then, must endure indefinitely.
But Give the Market a Chance to Act
On the other hand, the technical chart trader must not lack in patience. Stubborness
and overconfidence are to be avoided, but so are impatience and over-eagerness for
quick action. There is no necessity for changing last week’s analysis simply because
it has not worked out as quickly as was then indicated. There is no reason for chang-

ing one’s mind or market position on a basis merely of delay, sluggishness or inac-
tivity, but only on the basis of true and definite action in direct opposition to the pre-
vious analysis.
Review of our various chart examples cited in previous studies will serve to pre-
sent myriad examples where the analysis was correct but where the indications
came early in the technical formations and where considerable patience was needed
to carry out successfully the initial forecast. If a commitment is justified at all by the
chart action the fulfillment is worth waiting for patiently.
Weigh Risks in Advance
Another general principle, somewhat allied with all of the foregoing but especially
with a healthy conservatism, is a rational weighing of the total risk involved in any
commitment, in advance of making that commitment. This principle implies that
before any individual stock is bought or sold, the trader will assume that his hopes,
his expectations, his plans, his technical analysis, may all turn out to be just about
100% wrong. Postulating the action of the stock on that basis, he should consider
what course he would pursue if such an unfortunate event should come to pass.
This may seem like an easy, logical and commonplace thing to do, but it is, in fact,
extremely uncommon among the general run of traders. The truth is that the great
majority of stock market losses would be completely avoided if such a mental
process of looking ahead at both sides of the situation were indulged in. The aver-
age trader, even of fair experience and ability, is so prone to become wrapped up in
his own analysis, his own expectations of what is going to happen to the commit-
ment he is about to make, that he fails to give any thought whatever to the other side
of the picture which may possibly develop after he has actually made his commit-
ment.
If a trader is considering the purchase of a stock at around 45 he is naturally con-
fident that it is going to advance and his mind is filled with the pleasant anticipation
of selling out the stock later on at around 55, perhaps, or 60. His analysis may well
be correct, but something may transpire to upset it entirely, and he is false to his own
position if he fails to weigh the most serious consequences that may befall him in
the, even remote, possibility of his judgment being wrong, or of the market’s turn-
ing unexpectedly against him.
Helps to Avoid Over-trading
Such a mental weighing of all possibilities, including the worst, brings rewards
either through cutting of losses, through freedom from over-worry or, more usually,
through the guarantee of well-laid plans for any possible contingency. Considera-

tion of every possibility brings a healthy conservatism, perhaps desertion of the
anticipated commitment or, better still, either an actual or a mental stop-loss price at
which the possible future loss will be limited.
It is likely also to result in scale trading, or at least in keeping down to conserva-
tive levels the units of trading. This latter point is an important one. Over-trading
brings much greater loss, financial and psychological, than it does profit. That asser-
tion can be guaranteed, purely from the wealth of his own experience, by any mar-
ket analyst and adviser, before whose consideration pass many living examples of
the failures that result originally, almost entirely and directly, from over-trading.
This fault was at the bottom of the majority of tremendous losses and even
tragedies which followed the ‘‘new era’’ bull market of 1929. Profits seemed so cer-
tain that the average trader did not stop to think about losses. So long as he could
borrow money he never stopped to consider how much he might possibly lose
through his over-trading commitment if his judgment should be wrong. If he
thought first of buying 20 shares of a certain stock he immediately calculated men-
tally the profit which a 10 point advance would bring him. But that was only $200.
Not enough. Not fast enough. The simple way to increase profits faster was merely
to increase his commitment, even on slender margin, to say 100 shares with a men-
tal profit of $1,000, or to 1,000 shares, with a mental profit of $10,000.
But he forgot utterly about considering his potential and possible loss if the stock
declined instead of advancing. He forgot entirely about the bleak prospects of long
years of worry, struggle, despair which he might have to spend in paying off his
loan, in recouping his capital, if, by some odd chance, things did not go just as he
fondly imagined they must go.
Avoid over-trading, and decide before you go into the market how much of your
total capital you should risk in your trading operations. Don’t spread yourself out
too thin; keep something always in reserve against the unexpected.
Don’t Lean Too Heavily on Outside Advice
Finally, when all that we have learned from this course of study, from experience,
from studious research, from all other channels, has been digested and made a part
of our practical market knowledge, let us remember that we are our own masters in
the matter of personal market actions. Let us remember that no one is infallible, any
more than our charts are infallible, that no finite being has the ability to foresee
exactly what any stock is going to do.
Let us remember then that, within reasonable boundaries, and still avoiding over-
confidence and self-sufficiency, we have approximately an equal basis for analysis
with most other traders; that the garnering of various rumors, opinions and news
figments, is likely to distract our attention from a genuinely sound and scientific

approach to our problem; and that if we are intent on analyzing pure technical
action, we shall not need to clutter up our imaginations too much with outside facts.
The market itself will evaluate all such data for us, together with much important
inside information that we could not obtain for ourselves or from our most trusted
authorities.

figures, to earning reports, balance sheets, business prospects, public psychology
and such elements of assistance. Our technical chart

Let the Market Do its Own Forecasting
In short, we may let the market, and our proper analysis of its own technical action,
be sufficient for our own personal guide as to what is going on inside the secret sanc-
tums of the directors’ meeting room, the corporation order books, the private con-
ferences of professional operators and the other indefinite mediums of gossip and
unfounded rumor.
We need not go near a brokerage office in person; we need certainly not hang over
the ticker or devour the news releases as they come over the heated wires. Without
ignoring other basic news and confirmed information, we may rather sit back in our
own office or study, not secure in our own conceit, not smug with contented over-
confidence, but assured none the less that if we have properly prepared ourselves,
properly attuned our inner ear and eye, with study, with patience, with hard work,
experience and understanding, then our most faithful friend in practical market
operation is the market itself, as it outlines in the present its probable future course
for those who can successfully read its signs and signals.
Judging Personal Aptitude for Chart Trading
By no means will every individual find himself eminently fitted for chart trading.
For one thing, it requires time, interest and patience to a fairly high degree. Proba-
bly the most important characteristics are a basic sincerity and a desire to learn, for
practical experience is the fundamental key to success. And only actual trading or
simulation of actual trading, will show the neophyte how well-fitted he is for suc-
cessful and active trading.

STUDY XII
It would be slightly foolhardy for an inexperienced student to plunge immedi-
ately into practical trading with cold, hard-earned cash, to test his mettle. Paper
trading is the proper substitute and affords a pleasant, painless and comparatively
simple means of testing groundwork, experience and practical ability in the market
without the immediate risk of capital.
Paper trading requires no cash, no brokerage account, no rash plunge into the
maelstrom of actual trading. It requires merely an adequate set of charts and a note-
book. If the paper trader will study his charts, formulate his opinion of proper
action, and enter his theoretical trades on paper for anywhere from a month to a
year, and will follow this test with perseverance, with regularity, with close simula-
tion of actual cash trading, and above all with conscientious honesty and sincerity
to himself, he should discover very quickly whether or not it would be wise for him
to continue his technical trading with the risk of actual cash capital.
Paper Trading
If paper profits do not work out successfully under the conditions of trading previ-
ously tested, the student need not lose hope, though he should assuredly refrain
from entering the market until he has hit upon different methods which do yield a
consistent profit. He may need to trade more actively, but more probably less
actively. He may be better suited for long-swing trading, for cyclical investment or
for commitment in only certain lines.
The worst that can happen, in any case, is a paper loss, and if the student is sin-
cerely interested, then further testing, longer experience and healthy patience
should lead him to discover ultimate success on such foundations as have tried to
set forth in our study.
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
In the earlier chapters of our course we have attempted a fairly complete observa-
tion of the individual chart patterns which may prove of assistance in our general
study of technical stock market action. In the later chapters we have attempted to co-
ordinate this material into a comprehensive science from which the student may
proceed to his own practice and experience in technical analysis.
As we come to the end of our Course, therefore, it should be helpful to devote a
little time to a general summary. In reviewing our catalog of formations, for instance,
there are certain chart patterns which generally suggest reversal of the previous
price movement. Most of these are area formations of some sort, and are little more
than varying pictures of a highly normal and natural rounding off process as the

reverse technical strength increases, gradually overcomes the technical strength of
the preceding movement, and brings about a reversal of price trend.
Reviewing the Reversal Family
Thus we have the Head and Shoulders formation, the Common Turn, the Multiple
patterns, the Complex pictures with double heads
and double shoulders, and the Broadening Top. The
Triangles, we have seen, may lead to either reversal

Rectangle and the Diamond. All of these reversal
formations are simply the varying pictures which
result from a straight price movement meeting technical strength in the opposite
direction and being gradually overcome by it. More or less in a class by itself we
have the Island Reversal.
Many of these various formations, in actual chart observation, tend to verge from
one picture into another, yet that need not bother us much because their indication
is much more important than their specific pattern to which we can give one name
or another, so long as in any case the indication is for reversal of the previous price
movement. The critical lines – the lines whose breaking becomes the signal for
action – are apt to be clearly defined regardless of the exact classification of the pat-
tern, especially when the all-important volume indications are watched with care.
Reviewing the Continuation Family
In the classification of continuation patterns, the Symmetrical Triangle stands prob-
ably at the head of the list. Then we have the various other forms of Triangle, includ-
ing the Ascending and the Descending types in which the hypotenuse indicates the
direction of the ensuing move. Next we have the Rectangles and the less definite pat-
tern to which we have given the name of Continuation Head and Shoulders. We
have noted the Flags and Pennants as being especially reliable continuation forma-
tions. Then we have the price congestions with Drooping Bottoms and Accelerating
Peaks, the Horns, and such minor indications as the Zig-zag formation, One Day
Out-of-line Movements, Scallops, etc.
Other Special Figures and General Consideration
In addition to these specific chart pictures we have the additional helpful sugges-

tions resulting from the application of other more general factors, such as resistance
levels, support levels, the factor of sales volume taken in relation to the price move-
ment, and the highly important influence of trend lines, single and parallel, fanning
and flattening. And then, rather in a class by themselves, we have the entire family
of Gaps, which add their suggestions to the general pattern. We have the Common
Gap, the Continuation Gap, the Break-away Gap, and the Exhaustion Gap, as well
as the measuring theories based on single and multiple Gaps for determining the
possible extent of the ensuing move.
We would not for a moment have the student expect that he will make use of
every one of the patterns, chart formations, rules, theories and hypotheses included
in our study, in his every observation of practical chart action. We have tried to point
out the more important points in our catalog but it must also be remembered that it
is somewhat of a catalog none the less. We have attempted to present a complete
study of all the chart forms and theories which have proved to have forecasting
value and, for the sake of completeness, have included many points of minor char-
acter which the average reader will perhaps have comparatively few occasions to
use in actual practice.
The Question of Too Much Theory
We are quite sensible, for instance, to the possible criticism that we have presented
too much theory. The skeptical critic may perhaps remark that while any major price
movement is reversing its previous direction the
chart is almost bound to present some sort of a pic-

patent a misunderstanding of all that chart theory
claims and implies that it probably would never
even occur to the average reader or the experienced student, but it is only fair to
expose its fallacy to the possible few who have missed the fundamental point of our
theoretical science and reasoning.
The advocate of stock chart theory does not lay claim to having evolved any new
principles of fundamental technical action but merely to have called attention to cer-
tain laws and rules which have been working from time immemorial but which
have never before been clearly defined, definitely recognized or cataloged into any
set routine of science. The very simplicity of the logic behind our various chart the-
ories is not only the basis of such criticism as has been above proposed, but is its best
answer as well.

TRADING TACTICS
Chart Science Chiefly a Cataloging of Experience
We can admit freely and frankly, for instance, that practically any process of techni-
cal market reversal will fall, naturally and logically, into some one of our many
reversal patterns. But, after all, that is all that we claim, or need to claim, to prove the
usefulness of such patterns. The various patterns are simply a practical aid in detect-
ing the development of a price reversal. Our definition of all these patterns, our var-
ious technical names for them, are merely an aid to the study of the laws that have
always existed. They are made much more simple, much more easily understand-
able, definite and practical by the process of their cataloging and definition.
The science of astronomy does not lay claim to having influenced the movement
of planets in their orbit, but merely to have cataloged facts which have always
existed, simply to make the study of those facts easier and thus to lead into the
observation of additional facts and laws. So the science of technical chart reading
lays no claim to influencing the market or to developing new laws by which the mar-
ket must act, but rather only to the cataloging of facts, reactions, laws and theories
which have always existed, in order to clarify the study of the market and make eas-
ier further additions to the knowledge which goes to make up our science.
Why Charts Are Not Infallible
Unfortunately, the stock market and our stock charts do not move in such fixed and
exact natural cycles as the planets studied by astronomers. Consequently we have
always the danger of false moves and other misleading phenomena in our study of
technical market action. The elements of human fallibility, of unforeseeable news
development, of sudden catastrophe, or sudden improvement and of consequent
quick changes in popular psychology, all make our normal rules of technical chart
action liable to error, to fallibility, to sudden change of forecast. But, in further
defense of chart theories, it may merely be mentioned that in perhaps the majority
of such cases, it is not the fundamental indication of the chart which has gone astray
so much as the plans of the traders or investors whose operations were leading
toward a definite major forecast and movement.
The average investor knows how often his attitude toward the market or a specific
stock changes overnight, either because of some piece of news or merely because of
a psychological reversal of heart. But only the insider knows how often professional
operators are fooled in their carefully laid plans, how often they accumulate a stock
and are just ready to put it up, with the chart already indicating that projected
upward move, when the market grows too weak, when other factors intervene,
when, for any number of reasons, it suddenly becomes impractical to carry out the

STUDY XII
original plans, and the stock is dumped overboard in a hurried scramble to unload,
even with a heavy loss to the insiders. Such developments cannot be foreseen by the
stock chart any more than by the operators whose trading influences the forecast of
that chart.
Chart Deception Engineered by Operators
Insiders and professional traders are by no means unaware of the growing public
interest and education in chart theories and patterns. In normal trading there are cer-
tainly not enough chart traders to make it worthwhile for the professionals to play
against them instead of against the general public, but we have learned that the pro-
fessionals must play against someone in order to make their money. It is quite con-
ceivable, therefore, that the insiders might take a ‘‘crack’’ at chart traders now and
then by manipulating false patterns in their campaign stocks, with the knowledge
that, by arranging certain chart pictures, they could draw in a certain amount of
buying or selling, as they chose, with a view to strengthening their own position.
This theory gives the professional credit for more power, perhaps, than he actu-
ally possesses, but it is merely a theory. The student’s best defense, and his best pol-
icy in any case, is in keeping and watching a goodly number of individual charts.
The professional can hardly swing more than a handful of his pet individual issues
to suit himself, much less the market as a whole, and the misleading action of a few
individual charts will often be adequately exposed by the contrary indications of a
great many other ones.
And then, of course, there is always available the protection of the stop-loss order,
deserting situations which do not work out properly, as well as the inevitable devel-
opment of new technical indications which help the student to revise his forecast
and market position. It is reasonably safe to say that even the most powerful and
well-financed of operators cannot long prevent the chart’s showing the true techni-
cal picture.
A PROGRAM FOR THE BEGINNER
Having completed this Course, the student is now ready to test himself and his
newly acquired theoretical knowledge in actual market operations. If he was a
trader of some experience to begin with he has, no doubt, already charted stocks and
applied some of his technical theories to them, perhaps has even made a few trades
on the basis of technical action. And the novice, in his quite natural impatience for
action, has probably begun to keep at least a few charts and to try out thereon his
new forecasting rules. Nevertheless, it should be helpful to both if we outline a rea-
sonably complete program of action – the practical steps which the beginner should

TRADING TACTICS
now take to put his studies into profitable use. In outlining this program we shall
simply be bringing together, for the most part, the detailed suggestions as to pro-
cedure which have been made in various chapters of our Course, but assembling
them into a definite working plan.
For the student who has already made some sort of start (which, as we have said
in the foregoing, is certainly to be expected in the great majority of cases) this pro-
gram will serve as a means of checking his technique, calling his attention perhaps
to certain points which he may have overlooked or suggesting certain changes in his
present procedure which he may find it profitable to try out at least. Our program,
however, will be only suggestive; each trader, in the final analysis, will have to dis-
cover for himself the methods which are best adapted to his abilities and to the time
and money he can safely devote to his trading operations.
1. Making Up the List
The logical first step in our program is the selection of the list of stocks to be charted
with a view to trading in such of them as develop profitable opportunities from time
to time. The more important points to be considered in making up this list were dis-
cussed in Studies I and XI. We may summarize them briefly as follows:
A. Number to Chart.
Time is the limiting factor here. The best results generally speaking, are obtained by
charting as many individual stocks as one is able to maintain and study thoroughly
every day. Fifty is a good number. Less than 25 will hardly provide the necessary
background for comparison or a reliable reading of the general market trends. More
than 50 is fine provided one has the time to both maintain and study them. The per-
sonal equation enters here. With a little practice, the entering of the data is simple
and easy, but do not attempt to keep up more charts than you can or will find time
to analyze and interpret. The more charts you keep, obviously the more good, clear
opportunities for trading you will discover, but remember that you will have to dis-
cover them yourself, that the mere keeping of a large mass of undigested chart
record will not automatically bring them to your attention. Finally, don’t waste your
time keeping charts of stocks in which you would not be willing to trade.
B. Diversification.
Because some industries prosper while others decline, because the stocks of certain
groups are moving in the market while others are standing still, it is best to select a
well-diversified list for charting. Include at least one or two good trading stocks
from each important industrial group. Beyond that, your personal preferences may
be allowed reasonable scope.

STUDY XII
C. Price Level and Capitalization.
With certain exceptions, stocks in the middle price ranges are most satisfactory for
technical study and trading. Avoid ‘‘cheap’’ stocks – those selling under 10, say –
unless you have some very good personal reason for following one or two of them.
Concentrate on stocks selling in the general 15 to 60 range. Select actively traded
issues with a reasonably large number of shares outstanding, but here again the
middle ground is best. Thin stocks with a very small floating supply are easily
manipulated and are apt to move erratically without developing good chart pat-
terns. Stocks of extremely large issue, on the other hand, are usually sluggish in their
market action and offer limited trading profits except on a very long term basis.
There are, of course, exceptions to both rules.
D. Swing Power.
This consideration in the selection of stocks for charting and trading purposes
entails a study of the back history. If the back weekly or monthly charts, preferably
the former for a period of years, are available for analysis they will show graphically
which of two issues habitually moves in wider and, consequently, more profitable
swings. If charts are not available, the percentage spread between the yearly high
and low prices over several years as published in a great many statistical services
and brokers bulletins will give a fair indication of swing habits.
E. Group and General Market Averages.
Our advice is not to bother with either. They are, as we have previously stated, likely
to be more confusing than helpful to the average trader. However, if you feel that
you want to watch them, general market average charts are published in many mag-
azines and newspapers and may be followed therein. Group charts also are pub-
lished in certain weekly and monthly magazines. If you wish to chart certain group
averages for yourself a weekly record should suffice for all practical trading pur-
poses.
F. Changes in the List.
This is a question which, naturally, will not come up until after you have kept charts
for some little time. It is brought up here only to introduce the general advice not to
drop a stock from your chart portfolio without good reason for doing so. A certain
chart may present an uninteresting, even tiresome, picture of inactivity for months
but that is no reason to discontinue it in favor of some other issue which may be
attracting public attention at the time by its spectacular action. The chances are that
the inactive stock will eventually have its turn and, when it comes, you will be glad
you have the complete record and early, first-hand information of its movement.

TRADING TACTICS
2. Starting the Charts
Having selected the list of stocks which we are going to chart and study, the next
step, naturally, is to start the charts. The matters of paper to use, time and price scale,
sources of data, etc. were covered in detail in Study I (pages 14–21) and it is hardly
necessary for us to review them here. Start keeping daily charts on the entire list at
once, and weekly charts as the data accumulates and time permits.
There is, however, one important step in connection with the actual charting,
which you should take at this time. Get or make up the weekly charts on your cho-
sen stocks back at least to the beginning of the last completed cyclical trend. Analyze
these back weekly charts carefully to determine the probable support or resistance
levels that may appear in the current trend (see Study IX). Note these levels on the
newly started current daily charts. Analyze also the nearby back history as depicted
on the weekly charts to determine whether any trend lines developed on the weekly
charts should be projected on the current daily charts.
This study of trends, besides enabling you to project what may appear to be
important lines on our new charts, will determine in most cases the basic trends in
which your stocks are moving. You will make use of this information in establishing
your general trading policy later, following the rule of always trading, so far as pos-
sible, with the major trend.
3. Studying the Patterns
Having studied the back record and transferred to your new daily charts such infor-
mation derived therefrom as lends itself to current interpretation, your next step
should be to watch for and try to discover significant patterns or other price and vol-
ume action of forecasting value. You will hardly be able to do this with much confi-
dence until you have posted at least a month of new daily record; begin then,
however, to draw (in pencil, very lightly) all lines bounding the minor trends and
areas of price congestions that may appear. It will develop very quickly that some of
these lines have no continuing significance; they should be erased or at least disre-
garded. Other lines will have to be slightly re-drawn as the price action progresses.
One point which the beginner frequently forgets is that trend lines and pattern
boundaries are drawn across established reversal points. It takes at least two such
points to determine a good chart line. Not until a price movement has actually been
reversed is a reversal point established. The reversal need not be an important one
in extent or duration; it may be a matter of only a minor fluctuation lasting two or
three days and extending over a range of only two or three points, but it must have
actually occurred, nevertheless, before its reversal point is known and can be used
in technical analysis.

==================================================
                     PAGE 452                     
==================================================

STUDY XII
At the same time, follow the action of volume closely, watching particularly the
action of prices when volume tends to decline and when it suddenly increases.
Compare the price levels at which patterns or congestions develop with the sup-
port and resistance levels suggested by the back history. Study the action of prices
as these levels are approached and after they have been penetrated.
Compare the patterns formed simultaneously on different charts and make tenta-
tive forecasts of the relative possibilities for profit which they present, taking into
account trend action, support and resistance levels and other measuring indications
if any. (See Study X.) Check your forecasts by the subsequent price action.
4. Studying Price Movements
When a profitable price movement takes place, unexpectedly perhaps, look back to
see from what patterns or foundation it proceeded and what break-out signal was
given. If your daily chart does not show what appears to be an adequate foundation
for the move, look back on the weekly chart to see if a forecasting pattern appeared
there.
Watch for break-outs and study the extent of price movement and volume action
attending them. Note the closing price levels. Study the action and reaction of prices
following break-outs.
5. Trading on Paper
After you have charted your stocks for at least a couple of months and have learned
by trial and error which pattern and trend lines are apt to be most reliable, and after
you have made a number of tentative forecasts and checked them by subsequent
events, start trading on paper.
Conduct your paper trading exactly as though you were managing a real trading
account with actual cash capital. Keep an exact record of each buy and sell order,
each stop-loss order, and the results of each trade, as well as brokers’ commissions
and taxes. Keep your commitments within the bounds of your assumed trading cap-
ital. Don’t fool yourself by assuming that you had done something which it devel-
ops later you should have done but which you did not, in fact, do at the time. Second
guesses don’t count if you are sincerely desirous of perfecting your judgment and
your technique.
Don’t worry about the opportunities you may have missed because you didn’t see
them at the time or because your capital was already tied up in other situations.
Study rather to recognize your mistakes and the reasons for them. Remember that
your mistakes will be of greater value to you in your ultimate success than your cor-
rect forecasts. Learn to avoid the losses, and the gains will take care of themselves.

                     PAGE 453                     
==================================================

TRADING TACTICS
But remember also that there will always and inevitably be some losses, so don’t
let yourself be unduly upset by an occasional miscarriage of plans. Learn to use
stop-loss orders correctly to cut your losses short when the unexpected happens.
6. The Final Test
After you have traded on paper for several months and have thoroughly demon-
strated to your own complete satisfaction that your forecasts are working out prof-
itably, then and not until then, take the final test. Put a part of your cash trading
capital actually into the market. Now you may find that you are beset by an entirely
new set of problems – worries, doubts and temptations which did not trouble you
in your paper trading. Your first cash trades may not work out. But don’t lose your
confidence. Don’t be stampeded into changing your tactics; don’t listen to tips and
rumors any more than you did before; follow the same methods which you followed
in your successful trading on paper. Analyze your mistakes and study how to over-
come the tendencies which prevented you from putting theory into successful prac-
tice. Go back to paper trading, perhaps, for another course of schooling and then try
again.
