Preface
W
hen we stand before a new audience for the fi rst time, we
often get some variation of the following question: “Why should I
listen to anything you have to tell me?” It’s a fair question and one
that we would expect you to ask of anyone who offers their advice.
Over the years, we have had the privilege of working with hundreds
of thousands of investors and traders all around the world. Long
before this book was ever considered, The Market Guys were talk-
ing to traders in London, teaching beginner options to students in
Taipei, and helping investors protect their portfolios in Stockholm.
Through all of these experiences, we have observed certain strate-
gies and characteristics that are common to successful traders. We
have also observed certain other strategies and characteristics that
are common to unsuccessful traders.
We have joined you on the front lines of trading and investing. We
did not just read about stocks and options and use that information
to build a supposedly better mousetrap. Rather, we have bought and
paid for our education through real trades. We know what it feels like
to go home with a trade that could ruin your family fi nances. We have
watched helplessly as the market shut down for want of buyers when
we desperately needed to sell. We counseled traders who were placing
their last dollar on a high-risk speculative trade in the hope that they
could possibly escape their failings in the market.
Along the way, we realized that we were uniquely positioned
to actually help people protect their assets while building wealth.
You see, we didn’t create The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trad-
ing Success as a marketing gimmick to entice you to purchase our
version of beating the market. In a sense, this was a book that had
to be written. It was born of our passion to teach and truly make
a difference in peoples’ lives. If we can help one person preserve a
retirement account through a simple risk management strategy,
our work has been worthwhile. It has been said that teaching is

x Preface
a function of who you are, not what you do. Simply, a teacher must
teach. Regardless of our fi nancial lot in life, we would continue
to teach because we love to see a life transformed.
We are not so vain as to suggest that ours is the only path to
success in the markets. Many well-intentioned traders, fi nancial
advisers, and money managers will doubtless take issue with vari-
ous parts of our presentation. The world of fi nance and economics
leaves that door open. As teachers, we know that we must continue
to learn even as we teach. If we fi nd a point that needs to be refi ned
or a strategy that could be improved, we will be the fi rst to incorpo-
rate the changes. In the meantime, know that what we have laid out
in this book is the best that we have encountered.
The book contains 15 chapters, with each of the fi ve points
arriving at every third chapter. We begin by discussing the business
of trading and the importance of a trading plan. A key benefi t of the
trading plan is helping you manage your emotions, which is the sub-
ject of Chapter 2. Then we move into the tools of technical analysis
and some of the common mistakes that people make in the markets.
One of the lighter topics is Chapter 7; the seventh-inning stretch.
Here, we touch on the importance of keeping yourself in shape to
enjoy the fruits of your labors. More strategies and techniques fol-
low in the next two chapters as we review the best ways to fi nd stocks
and where to enter a new trade. From there, we introduce you to the
exciting world of options and show you that they are not just for
the professional trader. Chapter 12 covers the critical topic of manag-
ing risk using Point IV, the 1% Rule. The home stretch takes a light-
hearted approach to fi ctional traders who have not quite reached the
pinnacle of success. After a short discussion on how to select a broker,
we move to the fi nal Point V, which implores us to take action.
Another feature that you’ll fi nd throughout the text is the Chat-
ter Box. We have written this book together, but there are various
times when we share personal stories to help explain a point or add
some emphasis. These vignettes may talk about people we’ve worked
with, life experiences, or other observations and are noted as either
Rick’s Chatter Box or AJ’s Chatter Box.
The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success is a compilation
of strategies and practices that we trust will empower you to be suc-
cessful in the markets. But we want it to be much more than a how-
to reference book for trading. Throughout the following chapters,
you’ll read stories and examples of real people in real situations.

Preface xi
You’ll learn a bit more about our journey in this world of fi nances
and how we’ve grown over the years. Of course, you will see that we
are laying out for you the accumulated learning and experiences
from our minds. More than that, though, we hope you will see that
we are also offering you a gift from our hearts.
In the fi nal chapter, which discusses Point V, you will realize that
our admonition to you to take action extends beyond the mere act
of executing a trade. We want you to understand the reason we con-
tinue to reach out to our audience every day. Wealth really does have
a purpose. And that purpose dovetails with our purpose. We trust
that our faithfulness will leave the path we walk just a little straighter
for the ones who follow.

Acknowledgments
T
hrough this book, The Market Guys have invested our time, energy,
and passion to give you the very best we have. However, there are
so many more who have given of themselves to make this project a
reality. We wish to recognize some of them for their contributions
in this space.
RICK
I want to thank my own “Market Kids,” Caleb and Tori, for giving up
time with Dad to meet writing deadlines and giving me hugs at the critical
moments. The support and encouragement of my wife, Dani, kept me going
through many late nights and long miles. She is uniquely gifted with tire-
less enthusiasm and encouragement. Finally, I am grateful to my parents,
who not only gave me both roots and wings, but are continuing that legacy
with their grandchildren. The foundation of that legacy for our family is
2 Corinthians 8:9: the secret of true riches.
AJ
I am fortunate to be someone who was able to marry his high school sweet-
heart. Yvonne, I’ve known you since you were 15 years old. Not only have you
been my best friend, whom I trust with my life, but you have also been the rock
who grounds me in life. To my two wonderful sons, Greg and Anthony, you give
me the energy to continue on. I see greatness in both of you, and I trust you will
go out in the world and make a difference. Mom and Dad, I have learned how
to be successful from watching you both. Understand that the lessons you have
taught me as a child are now changing the lives of millions of people around
the world for good.

that, he started his own trading fi rm and spent over 10 years trading
gold, silver, and copper along with coffee, sugar, cocoa, and orange
juice. He served for two years as the chairman of the Options Floor
Trading Committee for COMEX and is considered to be one of the
world’s leading authorities in option trading.
Just before leaving the trading fl oor, to trade as a Nasdaq mar-
ket maker, he helped with the production of the Hollywood hit
fi lm Trading Places, starring Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy. Over
20 years later, this movie is still being enjoyed by millions around
the world. Even though it was written as a comedy film, it is one
of the best educational works about life on the trading fl oor.
Several years later, AJ pioneered the Trading Analytics Group
for Charles Schwab & Co., which is a collection of team profession-
als who educate both clients and high-profi le brokers in the areas
of technical and fundamental analysis. As a member of the Mar-
ket Technicians Association (MTA), he is also a chartered market
technician.
AJ now co-hosts a prime-time fi nancial television show called
Wealth & Wisdom, which airs on PBS through station WXEL in West
Palm Beach and is heard through on-demand radio as one of The
Market Guys. AJ is still going strong on the seminar circuit, speaking
as a master trainer for Anthony Robbins Wealth Mastery and master
trainer for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, along with guest
appearances at money shows and trading expos around the world.

Introduction
T
he Market Guys ’ Five Points for Trading Success exemplifi es our
philosophy of Keep It Super Simple (KISS). Before you begin with
the fi rst chapter of this book, take a few minutes and review the fol-
lowing overview of the fi ve points. You ’ ll see that the points are easy
to grasp and just as easy to follow. Even if you’ re a new trader, we
think you ’ ll appreciate the simplicity of the strategy.
1. Follow the Money Trail: Identify
the Trend
If you’ re going to buy a stock, be sure it is in a well- established
uptrend. Put your money where the money is going. You don’ t have
enough money to turn the market around, so don ’t try to buy into
a downtrend. We ’ ve yet to meet the trader who can consistently buy
the bottom and sell the top. Go with the fl ow.
2. Establish a Clear Support Level:
Pinpoint Support
For a long stock position, you need to identify a clear support level.
This is the level where the buyers step in after a period of selling
and push the stock back up. Identifying this price level is critical
because it will help you identify when you are wrong and you need
to exit the position. Trading without a clearly defi ned support level
will leave you blind in your risk management.
3. Wait for the Pivot Point: Strike with the Buyers
The pivot point is created when an uptrending stock has pulled
back to support and then started a new leg upward. It looks like a
“ V ” on the line chart. The left side of the “ V ” is the pullback down
to support. The right side of the “ V ” is formed when the buyers step

==================================================

xviii Introduction
back in and rally the stock off support. Even though the stock is in an
overall uptrend, the rule here is to buy with the buyers.
4. The 1% Rule: Protect Your Position
The 1% Rule is your guideline for deliberately and specifi cally man-
aging risk. Limit your loss on any given trade to 1 percent of your
trading account. This is accomplished by identifying your risk per
share based on the support identifi ed in Point II and then tying it
into your position size. By trading the right position size and exiting
the trade when support is broken, you are able to limit a single trade
loss to 1 percent of your trading account value.
5. Take Action: Act for Results
Taking action brings The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Suc-
cess into reality. It involves two steps: actually executing the trade
and then recognizing that your wealth has a purpose. Don ’t be afraid
to take some risk and be ready to reap the rewards. When you’ ve
achieved success, change your world.

Blueprint for Success
CREATING YOUR TRADING PLAN
I
n 490 B.C. the Persian army invaded the plains of Marathon and
met the forces of Athens in what was perhaps the single most impor-
tant battle in Greek history. The Athenian army took the offensive
against the vastly larger Persian forces while they were still preparing
for battle. Against great odds, the Greeks prevailed. According to
legend, a Greek soldier named Pheidippides ran from Marathon
to Athens with the message, “ Rejoice! We conquer! ” He immediately
collapsed and died from his efforts. Today, in the United States alone,
nearly half a million runners participate every year in the 26.2- mile
race that commemorates Pheidippides ’s valiant feat.
In preparation for this event, runners will lay out a schedule that
covers diet, running mileage, hill workouts versus speed training,
sleep, recovery days, and hydration. Entire web sites, books, and
software packages are devoted to making sure the runner doesn’ t

weeks or even months are dedicated to planning and preparation
for the marathon. If you scour through all the articles and books
written on marathon competition, almost all will include, or at least

most runners will be fi nished with the event just a few hours after the

marathon blanket, T- shirt, goody bag, and sore legs that won ’t be
back to normal for at least two weeks.
Why is it that the same person who wouldn’ t dream of running a
marathon without a complete plan will manage their fi nances with-
out so much as a thought about how they’ ll achieve their objectives?
Take it a step further — many of these same people run through their
investments without even defi ning their objectives! The reason we
open this book with a discussion of a trading plan is that it will set the
foundation for everything we do. One of the fatal fl aws of trading is
that it lets us enter the game without a trading plan. Worse, we may
even be successful for a time.
It is not at all uncommon for a new trader to place a trade and
make a profi t. The new trader is especially careful to analyze the
trade prior to opening the position. Then they step through the trade
with the care that one takes when treading new territory. Before they
know it, the trade is profi table and they close the position with a net
gain. They start thinking, “ Hey, this is easier than I thought! ” and
they move to the next trade. Before long, they’ re taking positions with
more confi dence and the assumed risk increases with each trade.
This same trader may have a stretch of profi table trading but then
falls into a losing pattern. Or they experience “ The Trade” ; the sin-
gle trade that cures them of any remaining vestige of confi dence as
it falls below every support and drains their account into a mainte-
nance call. The problem is that this trader may not even realize that
they have fallen into a period of net losses or, if they do recognize
it, they don’ t understand the reasons for their change in fortune. As
a last resort, they ’ ll change their trading style; opening exception-
ally large positions to try to exact revenge on the market, trading
options without proper training or becoming a long - term investor by
holding on to positions that were originally meant to be short - term
trades. All of this is the result of not having a trading plan and hold-
ing yourself accountable to the objectives that you ’ re trading toward.
In this chapter, we ’ ll discuss in detail some of the key components of
a trading plan and then conclude with a trading plan checklist.
Trading Is No Longer a Team Sport
Retail trading really came into its heyday in the mid - 1990s with the
explosive growth of day trading. In 1997, two guys from Houston,
Chris Block and Jeff Burke, made the cover of I nc. magazine with the

teaser headline “ Bad Boys of Wall Street.” The article started with this
opening line: Their aim: move fast, make money, have fun. Who knew they
would threaten a whole industry in the process? With talk about fast cars, new
offi ces, and armies of traders who were practically siphoning money
from the market in mere seconds, the phenomenon of retail day trad-
ing was launched. One example refers to Jeff Burke’ s biggest day in
the market when he made $ 50,000. $ 50,000 in one day! People were
fl ocking to the Block Trading headquarters in Houston and dropping
$ 25,000 just for the right to lock down a city for opening a franchise
at some point in the future. Block Trading is no longer around, but
there are some lessons to be learned from those early days.
First of all, in the mid- 1990s the state of technology required
that people fi nd a retail trading offi ce to trade. Sure, there were
some choices that allowed for trading remotely, but the quality
of information and trade execution wasn ’t nearly as high as what
was available in a trading offi ce. These offi ces created an atmos-
phere of anticipation and played on the trader’ s ego. They were
often dimly lit with the shades pulled over the windows. Multiple
television monitors constantly played CNBC and other networks
for immediate market commentary. Other monitors displayed real-
time news feeds, which scrolled through headlines too fast to allow
for any analysis but served to let the traders know they were still
plugged into the action. Banks of trading computers sat side by
side, with traders coming and going throughout the day. It wasn ’t
unusual to see a highly respected heart surgeon trading next to
a college dropout and the two of them speaking to each other as
colleagues. Occasionally, a trader would enter the room with one
of the subscription - based split pagers. These creative devices did
exactly what the name suggests. Whenever news hit the wires of a
company announcing a stock split, the pager would send an alert
with the information. For a time, the fortunate trader could take a
position before the news was fully digested by the market and then
sell into the crowd’ s buying.
The technology also allowed traders on the fl oor to access Level 2
data. In addition to the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), with
Level 2 you could see all of the price and volume levels below the high
bid and above the low offer (see Figure 1.1 ). This was something
that most brokers hadn ’t seen at that time. Finally, these traders often
traded before the market opened at 9:30 A.M. and traded well past the
market ’s close at 4:00 P.M. Using the new kids on the technology block,

electronic communication networks (ECNs), retail traders could buy
and sell to each other even when the rest of the market was closed.
Finally, these rooms were often separated from the lobby area by an
attentive gatekeeper, who let only the chosen traders through a door
that bore the sign, “ Trading Room— Traders Only.”
While these retail trading rooms had many faults that are outside
both the scope and objective of this book, there was one key ben-
efi t that they provided to the trader. An esprit de corps developed
between traders because they were trading day after day with the
same people. This camaraderie caused traders to help each other
through education and accountability. One of the common prac-
tices of day traders in these retail offi ces was to call out fi lls. Let ’s say
several traders wanted to buy 1,000 shares each of Microsoft. The
fi rst trader to get his buy order fi lled would call out the details of
the fi ll: which market maker fi lled his order, how many shares they
sold, and whether the order was fi lled on the bid or offer. All of this
information would be helpful to the other traders as they managed
their orders. For example, if a key market maker (often called the
Axe) fi lled the order very quickly on the bid, that told the other
traders that there may be heavy selling pressure and they could lower
their buy order or cancel it altogether in anticipation of a price drop.
The point to be made here is that the group of traders as a whole
had more information than individual traders alone.

The mechanics of a trade were also much easier to learn in the
retail trading rooms. There are seemingly endless details that a new
trader must learn about the trading software, types of trades, when
to place trades, position sizing, and so forth. In the isolation of one’ s
own home offi ce, fi nding the answers to these questions or learning
the nuances of the minor details can be diffi cult at best, impossible
at worst. However, in the retail trading offi ces, these issues were dis-
cussed throughout the day, and a new trader would very quickly pick
up the salient points of the game.
Besides the learning environment that trading fl oors offered,
the accountability that naturally resulted from trading elbow to
elbow was another signifi cant benefi t. If you took a position and
called out the fi ll as we described a moment ago, everyone around
you knew what you were trading. That meant they knew if you were
making money — or losing money! There was a peer pressure that
grew if you stayed in a losing position. Nobody likes to have to
admit that they ’ re losing money, so it was easier to close out a posi-
tion for a small loss than to hold on to a loser and have to continu-
ally explain to your fellow traders why you thought this trade was
going to be different. In today’ s trading environment, we trade with
almost total anonymity. Often, a trader ’s own spouse isn ’t aware of
the activity in the trading account. This situation makes it very easy
to rationalize bad trades in our heads and continue holding a bad
position.
To accommodate these defi ciencies in the contemporary trading
environment, a trading plan needs to include both points: educa-
tion and accountability. It’ s imperative that the trader recognize that
while the market is generally simple to enter, there are many facets
of trading that require a sequential education plan. For example,
any new trader can step in and place a buy order, followed by a sell
order. But understanding how to properly analyze chart patterns
prior to entering the trade isn’ t intuitive. Learning to read a chart is
very similar to learning a new language. Both require some formal
education followed by practice using the new language. The market
is also constantly changing, and the education plan should include
continuing education. In the past decade we ’ ve seen such changes as
decimalization of pricing, increasing interest in options trading, and
expanded capabilities of trading software platforms. If you hide your
head in the sand and fail to advance with the market and technology,
you will eventually be left at a disadvantage.

When a trading plan is developed, it becomes the benchmark for
accountability. The plan will become the surrogate for the trader who
once sat by your side and knew if you were following your defi ned
strategy. Let ’s assume that your plan is to be a day trader. By defi ni-
tion, a day trader opens the day and closes the day in cash. Long
or short positions are opened and closed during market hours, and
the price moves are measured in minutes or hours. Because your
plan includes a strategy for your time horizon, you’ ll know when that
strategy is broken. We ’ ll take a look at an example of how this would
work. After analyzing the opening of the market, you see that the
stock price gapped down and dropped to support. You decide to buy
the stock on support based on the expectation that it will bounce off
support in the next hour and you ’ ll capture a profi t from the quick
rally. After entering the position, the stock languishes on the support
line for the rest of the day. It neither bounces up to new highs nor
drops below support to new lows. At this point, you have a decision
to make. Based on your trading plan, you should exit the position
and close the day in cash. You could always reestablish the long posi-
tion tomorrow if the stock is still holding on to support. However,
you decide to hold the position overnight by rationalizing that it
could gap up tomorrow in the same way it gapped down today and
you don’ t want to miss the move. This type of decision is really based
on hope rather than any proper analysis. The worst - case scenario
occurs the next day when the stock gaps down below support. Hav-
ing rationalized the fi rst departure from the trading plan, you now
continue with reasons why the drop shouldn’ t continue. Two weeks
later you fi nd that you’ re spending every moment in the market star-
ing at this open position as the stock continues on its downward
course, searching for any semblance of support that you can hang
your hopes upon. How did you get here? Simple— you broke the
rules that you established in your trading plan. Even if the position
had not moved into a loss, it didn’ t reach your objective (a bounce
off of support) in the time frame that your strategy requires. Most
traders fi nd themselves in this situation because they don’ t have a
trading plan, though, not because they ignored their trading plan.
The point here is that a trading plan will highlight for you the proper
course of action and help to hold you accountable to your decision.
Before we move on, we should take a closer look at the issue
of trading time horizons. When The Market Guys present at trad-
ing expos, we’ ll often jokingly advise people to avoid becoming

investors because they ’ re bad traders. But the painful truth is that
many p eople have long - term positions in their portfolio that were
originally meant to be short - term trades. In fact, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service recognizes “ worthless stock ” when a stock price has
dropped to the point that there is no reasonable hope of recovery.
Isn ’t it ironic that the IRS will recognize the truth in a trade before
we will? Don ’t raise your hand as you read this paragraph (especially
if you ’ re reading this on an airplane or sitting next to your wife at
an antiques auction), but how many of you still have Webvan Group
(see Figure 1 .2 ) somewhere in your account? At what point should
you have recognized that maybe this stock wasn ’t going to return to
its previous highs? At one time, this stock was a popular trading stock
among retail day traders. Many of these traders made good profi ts
over time on this stock, too. Somewhere along the way, though, the
position they bought didn ’t behave the way it had in the past. For the
unfortunate trader who held the position in the hope that it would
recover, the stock never met their expectation. By the end of 2001,
the price had dropped below a penny and has rested comfortably
there ever since.
The reason we’ re spending additional time on this point is that
it is one of the most common mistakes made by novice and experi-
enced traders alike. As long as the position is open, there is hope
for recovery, however remote. Once the position is closed, we’ ve
locked in our loss. There is a misleading belief that a loss isn’ t a loss

until the trade is closed. Nonsense! Don’ t ever use this fool ’s logic
on yourself. Whether a trade is open or closed, if the stock price is
lower now than when you bought it, you have a loss! One of the char-
acteristics of trading options is that it forces you to admit your loss
by a predetermined date when the option expires. Stock traders can
fool themselves ad infi nitum because a stock doesn ’t expire unless
the company fi nally declares bankruptcy and reorganizes. Your trad-
ing plan should defi ne your time horizon— whether it ’s intraday,
short -t erm swing trading over one to two weeks, or position trading
over a number of months. Your analysis of the trade should be based
on that time horizon, and then you need to be diligent in hold-
ing yourself accountable to that plan. If you’ ve opened a position
and found that the trade has started to exceed your time horizon,
close the trade and fi nd a new position. You may not be losing
money in the stock itself, but if you ’ ve locked your cash into a non-
performer, you’ re experiencing a loss of opportunity. Remember,
you could always place your cash into a certifi cate of deposit and get
a nominal interest return.

of these systems:

low risk.
(cid:127) The founder has “ discovered” a secret to the market that some-
how evaded millions of other traders.
(cid:127) The system will teach you what only the professionals know
and don ’t want you to know.
(cid:127) Their disciples will march before a camera with claims of
having made thousands or millions in a relatively short time
period.
(cid:127) They ’ ll tell you that you ’ re not making money because you ’ re
trading the wrong product— for example, currencies are more
profitable than stocks, gold is more profitable than mutual
funds, and so on.

We’ ll assume that we’ re not surprising you here with anything
that you haven ’t already seen on late- night infomercials or pop- up
banners on your favorite search engine. One of the questions that
comes to our minds each time we see these is: Why do they always
include the caveat “ Results Not Typical ” when their followers are
onscreen making claims of riches? If the system really works, shouldn’ t
the results be typical? Let’ s be clear about the purpose of The Market
Guys ’ Five Points for Trading Success— we ’ re not showing you anything
new or revolutionary. We especially don ’t claim to hold a “ secret” that
we ’ ll tell you for the right price. We’ re offering this guide as a collec-
tion of best practices that are known to retail and professional trad-
ers alike. If you ’ ve reached this point in your reading with the belief
that by the end of this book you’ ll have the secret to fast riches, then
please stop now and discard those thoughts. The markets reward the
patient and disciplined, not the greedy and careless.
Looking at this phenomenon from another angle, consider the
following credentials and decide if you would listen to this person as
a fi nancial guru. Ben was diligent in attending to his fi nancial plan.
At least once a week, he would review the numbers and make the
appropriate buy decisions. One thing about Ben, though, is that he
never sold. He had been working with the same strategy for years
and he stuck to his plan. As Ben would tell it, he didn’ t get caught
up in complex investments. He never touched options, currencies,
or futures. He had a single objective and pursued it with unassum-
ing patience. Just a few years ago, Ben had less than $ 100,000 cash.
Last year, Ben decided to retire at 52 years old with over $ 66 million
in his account. Again we’ ll pose the question: Would you consider
this person as a role model for your fi nancial planning? Take it a
step further. If you saw the previous biographical description under
a sales banner advertising “ Ben ’s Secrets to Wealth and Financial
Security, ” a fi ve - CD set along with accompanying workbooks for only
$ 99, would you drop the $ 99? Well, it would certainly make sense
until we give you the fi nal piece of the profi le puzzle. Ben Chason
had just won the annuitized $ 163 million Mega Millions jackpot, a
multistate lottery. The $ 66 million was his after - tax check from his
winning numbers. Interestingly, we also see lottery winners in the
markets. These are the people who, for example, had stock options
loaded into their employee retirement accounts during the 1990s’
tech boom and woke up to fi nd seven - or eight - fi gure account equi-
ties. While we can admire them for their good fortune, we need to be

careful about setting them on a pedestal as the model of mastering
the markets.
Chatter Box—AJ
While Rick and I are traveling around the world, it is not uncommon for
us to meet people who are excited about the opportunities in trading
the U.S. markets. If you are just starting out with your own trading plan,
be sure your excitement doesn’t get in the way of making good, sound
investment decisions. If you are at the basic levels of trading, everyone
you meet at the trade shows will look like an expert. Don’t be fooled by
the bells and whistles; simply check the resumes of those who claim to
be experts and you will have a better chance of avoiding the “noise.”
We will be talking more about this in the chapters that follow.
When you look at others who exhibit the outward appearance
of having mastered the markets, you ’ ll be tempted to trade what
they ’ re trading. Take a look to your left and you ’ ll see the gold trader
and d ecide that gold is where you need to be. So you load up on
gold stock, gold funds, gold futures, and rare coins. But then it hits
you that gold can drop in price, too. You then look to the right and
hear that options are the way to make consistent money. After all,
you ’ ve always heard that the most you can lose is the price you pay
for the option, right? Because you don ’t understand how to trade
options, you still aren’ t making money but at least you’ re losing it
more slowly. It may take longer, but the strategy will still deplete your
account. It ’s a bit like getting nibbled to death by a duck; it doesn’ t
really hurt along the way but the end result is the same. Finally, you
decide that your real problem is that your analysis isn’ t compre-
hensive enough. Having pored through all the trading magazines
and books you can fi nd, you realize that you’ re only using less than
5 percent of the possible technical indicators. If the Fibonacci
retracements, fans, and circles aren ’t important, then why are they
discussed by the e xperienced traders? Surely, that ’s the reason why
your trading isn’ t profi table. You decide to purchase the complete
course on Elliott waves and get yourself to the point where you can
discuss Fibonacci as if you ’ d discovered the Golden Ratio yourself.

Now your pretrade analysis i ncludes a combined convergence of
retracements, wave analysis, Bollinger Bands, and three stochastics.
But you ’ re still losing money.
Here’ s where your trading plan comes into play. Your plan includes
a defi nition of what you plan to trade. If you ’ re going to trade stocks,
then ignore the calls to chase the riches of gold. If you want to trade
gold, fi ne — then develop a new plan. Don ’t ignore your existing plan
because you stayed up too late in the hotel room and the only enter-
tainment on TV was an infomercial for collectible coins. The Market
Guys are great believers in the power of options as a trading prod-
uct. But if you don ’t have a plan to learn how to trade them properly
and what your strategy looks like, then don ’t touch them! Your plan
should also outline your trading objectives. If you’ ve decided that your
goal is to beat the broad market performance by 10 percent, then you
should be working toward an 11 percent return when the Dow or S& P
500 is up 10 percent. That’ s a reasonably conservative goal for a trader
who is approaching retirement age and can’ t sustain large drops in his
account value. Now if you see a banner scrolling across your computer
screen with claims of 700 percent returns in the market, your response
should be to smile and move on. That ’s not your goal, and you ’ re fool-
ing yourself if you think that those kinds of returns don ’t come with a
corresponding increase in risk.
Know When to Fold ’ Em
We would be remiss in our discussion of a trading plan if we didn’ t
take a few moments to delve into the trader - cum - gambler personality.
In 1997, we had a trader who came into our day- trading offi ce with a
single trading objective. He had noticed that a particular stock had
repeated the same cycle for the previous several years (see Figure 1 .3 ).
The stock would dip at the end of the year and then rise through the
fi rst part of the following year. Toward the end of the year, the stock
would drop downward, only to rise again in the fi rst quarter of the
following year. His plan was to short the stock before the dip and ride
the falling wave through the end of the year. He didn’ t have a what- if
plan at all. If the stock failed to perform as he expected, there was
no risk management. In essence, he was laying his fortune on “ Red -
One ” — the highest payout slot on the roulette wheel.
Since his story made it into this chapter of the book, you ’ ve
already guessed that the ball didn ’t land on Red - One. As the year

came to a close, not only did the stock fail to drop, but it was trend-
ing upward, which put him into a maintenance call. That’ s when
the value of your equity drops to the point that any purchases or
shorts made on margin (borrowed money) must either be covered
or more money must be deposited into the account to protect the
broker against the trader’ s defaulting on the loan. So the trader
went for the double - or - nothing move. He collected more funds and
shorted more of the same stock. His reasoning was the same that
affl icts many traders who fi nd themselves in losing positions. If the
stock was a good buy a month ago, it ’s a great buy today. The prob-
lem, though, was that he was shoveling funds into shorting a stock
that was on a clear uptrend. Not long afterward, he was in another
maintenance call. What was different about this maintenance call
was that he didn ’t have any more funds to feed the fi re that was
roaring from his positions that had crashed and burned. He was
forced to close his positions at a substantial loss. The saddest part
of the story is that all of this trading was done without his wife’ s
knowledge. He had made the initial trade and, when the troubles
mounted, he drew funds from his family’ s other accounts without
telling anyone else. His gambling tendencies were too shameful
to admit, and he hoped that he could recover without anyone ’s
becoming aware of his follies. Unfortunately, he wasn ’t the only
trader who came into our trading fl oor primarily because it was
closer than the riverboats.

How do you know if you or someone close to you has a trading
problem? The following behaviors can signal the need for help:
Preoccupation . Problem traders spend a lot of mental energy think-
ing about the next time they will trade, planning their strat-
egy, or thinking of ways to get money for trading. This will
begin to impact their health, their ability to sleep, and their
ability to focus on other issues. The problem trader will be
distracted at work or appear distant to family and friends.
Inability to stop or control trading . Problem traders find that they
cannot stop trading when they want to. Maybe they decide to
quit altogether, but then they still trade anyway. When they
trade, they may try to control the amount of time or money
they spend, but they are unable to stick to the limits they set.
They often trade until their last dollar is gone. These traders
will see trades that no one else sees because they need the
miracle trade to make up for their losses.
“ Chasing ” losses . Problem traders get a strong urge or idea to win
back money that they have lost in the past. They may say, “ If
only I could win back what I ’ ve lost, I wouldn’ t have to trade
anymore.” More and more, they feel trapped. They start
thinking that the hole they have dug is so deep that only a
big trading win can get them out of it. Their best hope is to
hit a home run, and they ’ ll keep swinging until they do so.
Trading to escape negative emotions. Problem traders may trade in
order to feel better temporarily or to change their mood.
They may feel angry, lonely, bored, anxious, or depressed,
and they trade to escape these emotions. Trading feels like
an escape from their problems. After trading, the negative
feelings return, as bad as ever. Because the act of trading
gives them temporary relief from the negative emotions, they
must trade more frequently and assume greater risks with
each trade.
Lying to conceal trading . The problem trader has lied to his spouse,
family, friends, or employer in order to hide or to minimize
his trading losses. These lies range from concealment to
outright lying. The trader feels a growing shame for his lack
of discipline and hopes that if he can win back his losses,
he’ ll be able to avoid confronting the issue altogether.

Borrowing to pay for trading . Debts grow because of trading. Bills
are unpaid. Money that could be used to pay bills is used for
trading. Problem traders may have borrowed money from
family or friends because of trading losses. They may have
sold possessions, stocks, or bonds; borrowed from retirement
accounts or savings; or gotten a second mortgage because of
trading losses.
Allowing trading to jeopardize other parts of life . Trading can ruin
marriages, friendships, careers, school performance, and
reputations. Divorce, bankruptcy, or legal problems are all
closely associated with compulsive trading. Compulsive trad-
ers act very much like someone with a drug habit. Former
activities and social gatherings are shunned when the trader
is experiencing mounting losses.
Ambivalence about quitting or controlling trading . A problem trader
may say things like:
“ I know I should stop but I love to trade. ”
“ My wife/husband/partner/parents/children want me to
quit but I ’ m not sure I do.”
“ Maybe I can slow my trading to the point where it is
manageable. ”
“ I want to quit but don ’t think I can. ”
Now that you ’ ve read through the list of symptoms, you should
know that this list is a compulsive gambling checklist. The only change
that we ’ ve made is to replace the word g ambling with the word trad-
ing. Nevertheless, you can see the patterns emerge in the trader we
described. He was borrowing money to pay for trading, concealing his
trading from his family, jeopardizing his entire fi nancial well - being, and
he was most certainly preoccupied with his trades. Toward the end of
his short - lived trading career, he would enter the trading fl oor early in
the morning and sit and stare at the stock chart all day. He was becom-
ing physically drained from the mental and emotional energy that he
was investing daily in a losing account. If we’ ve cut too close to the truth
about your trading habits with this discussion, then we encourage you
to seek a helping hand. Sure, every trade involves risk and to a certain
degree is a gamble. But there is a signifi cant difference between taking
a calculated gamble and being an out- of - control gambler. The former
knows where the limits are and is disciplined to operate within those

limits. The latter may or may not understand the importance of limits
but disregards them in any case.
Shucking Right Down to the Cob
Chatter Box—Rick
The Deep South has a lot to offer, but one of my favorites is the col-
lection of homespun sayings that captures the essence of a thought
better than most. When you’re upset, you get your feathers ruffl ed; if
something is hard to fi nd, it’s as scarce as hen’s teeth; and if you’re
really worried, someone might say you’re as nervous as a long-tailed
cat in a room full of rocking chairs. I have a good friend who often
talks about “shuckin’ right down to the cob.” It’s his way of saying,
“Let’s strip the extras off and talk about what’s really important.”
Now it’s time to take a look at the cob of your trading plan. What
do you really need to make sure this plan is going to work for you?
1. Education
Before you enter the trading waters, you must fi rst prepare yourself
through education and training. As we ’ ve mentioned, the markets
will let anyone onto the playing fi eld, but that doesn ’t mean you’ re
necessarily qualifi ed. The only requirement for admission is a funded
account. There are many willing players to take your account from
you, one trade at a time.
The Market Guys have a basic rule: KISS— Keep it Super Sim-
ple. That should apply to your education, too. We’ ve watched people
who have listened to every podcast show we’ ve produced, read every
article we ’ ve written, participated in every web seminar we’ ve con-
ducted, and attended as many live events as they could. They’ ve
taken copious notes and requested copies of every presentation. Yet
they still haven’ t placed a trade. Don ’t let yourself get caught in the
paralysis - by - analysis trap. You need to be adequately prepared before
you begin trading, but there is no virtue or benefi t in creating your
own trading PhD program. That said, what are the important areas
of preparation?

First of all, you should be thoroughly familiar with the software
that you plan to use for trading. Almost every brokerage fi rm offers
a basic execution and analysis platform via the web. These are gen-
erally the simplest and most foolproof. They are usually designed
for the beginner or part- time trader. You should take advantage of
opportunities to learn the software, through either online tutorials
or customer service assistance. Some of the deeply discounted bro-
kerage fi rms offer little or no support when it comes to using the soft-
ware. Stay away from these operations unless you are already familiar
with the mechanics of trading and are confi dent that you’ re ready
to use the software without assistance. We ’ ll discuss the process of
selecting a broker and software later in the book. If you decide to
trade with one of the advanced trading platforms, make sure that
there is a valid reason for moving up the technology chain besides the
fact that the advanced systems look great on your computer monitor
and draws the attention of your administrative assistant. Advanced
trading software has more ways to get you in trouble if you don’ t
know what you ’ re doing. Hopefully, your parents didn ’t give you the
keys to a Ferrari when you fi rst learned to drive. The Ford Fiesta
didn ’t have all the power and speed, but there was a time when that
was actually a benefi t. The same principle applies to trading software.
The Level 2 screen is mesmerizing to a new trader. You can watch as
market makers and ECNs jockey for position on the bid and offer,
changing their share size and price every few seconds. The numbers
stream like the prices on a gas pump when you ’ re fi lling your car.
It makes for fun eye candy, but the distraction often turns out to be
pricey entertainment for many traders who use it as the basis for
their buy and sell decisions.
You also need a solid initial education on the product that
you ’ re trading. If you decide to trade equities fi rst — as many traders
do — then ground yourself in the basics. Do you know the difference
between a dividend - paying stock and one that doesn’ t pay dividends?
The fi rst time you see your position trading ex - dividend you will!
When a company declares a dividend, it sets a record date when you
must be on the company’ s books as a shareholder to receive the divi-
dend. Once the company sets the record date, the stock exchanges
assign the ex - dividend date. The ex - dividend date is normally set for
stocks two business days before the record date. If you purchase a
stock on its ex - dividend date or after, you will not receive the next div-
idend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you p urchase

before the ex- dividend date, you get the dividend. Here’ s the kicker:
The stock price will often fall by the dollar amount of the dividend
if the dividend is signifi cant. If you didn’ t know this, you might be
shocked to see your stock drop several dollars for no apparent rea-
son and, consequently, you exit a good trade due to ignorance. With
options, there are many more factors to consider than with stocks.
When you trade stocks, you’ re looking at the trend and making a
decision about whether the trend is up, down, or sideways. If you
buy stocks, you want the trend to go up. If you short stocks, you want
the trend to go down. Sounds easy enough, right? If you ’ re trad-
ing options, you may want the trend to go up, but you also need it
to go up within a certain time frame (before the option expires!).
Of course, you may choose an option strategy that requires that the
stock go neither up nor down but continue in a sideways channel in
order for you to profi t. Futures have a different type of account fund-
ing requirement than stocks or options and impact your account
equity differently. This isn’ t the forum for explaining these nuances
in detail, but you can start to see how your choice of trading product
affects your training and education. Just because you ’ re a successful
stock trader doesn ’t mean you can walk onto the currency fi eld and
enjoy the same success.
Your education and training must include a proper foundation
for understanding the psychology of trading. We cover this in more
detail in Chapter 2 , “ Are You Out of Your Mind?” Keep in mind that
since trading is not a proper science in the sense that there is not a
quantifi able cause- and - effect relationship between stock prices and
events, you need to understand and control the emotional part of the
process. If you don’ t think that dealing with money is an emotional
activity, then you probably have ice water fl owing through your veins.
For the rest of us mortals, we’ ll spend the remainder of our lives
keeping in check the overwhelming urge to do dumb things when it
comes to our money.
Part of your initial education and training may include some
form of paper trading. The term paper trading comes from the days
when you would simulate real trading by writing the trades on a
paper trading log and make note of your profi ts and losses as well as
any comments on the trade itself. Today, many trading software pack-
ages include a simulation mode, which will look and feel like the real
thing with real market data. The only difference is that when you log
off and log back on, you start with a clean slate. Paper trading gives

18 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
you the opportunity to analyze setups and buy and sell without actu-
ally putting your money at risk. You can begin to feel the emotional
roller coaster that accompanies trading when you fi rst get started.
The criticism of paper trading is that it doesn’ t adequately prepare
you for real trading because there is no substitute for actually putting
your money on the line. It’ s like the old joke about a fellow who
was asked about the difference between a recession and a depres-
sion. “ A recession,” he replied, “ is when my neighbor loses his job.
A depression is when I lose my job.” We agree that paper trading
may not tell you when you ’ re ready to trade but it does a good job of
telling you when you ’ re not ready to trade. As we’ ve said many times
in our seminars, if you ’ re losing money while you’ re paper trading,
please don ’t start trading live!
Pilots often use a fl ight simulator to practice certain maneuvers
that they may not want to replicate in actual fl ying. For instance,
you can practice taking off and losing an engine on climbout. These
exercises are useful to sharpen your skills and prepare you for the
actual event, should it ever occur. However, a fl ight instructor would
never stick a new student in a simulator for 20 hours and then bid
him good luck on his fi rst real solo fl ight. There is a distinct benefi t
of learning alongside an instructor who can help you through the
actual maneuvers in real fl ight. The same thought applies to paper
trading. Use it to refi ne your skills, learn the basics and prepare for
the real thing, but understand that your fi rst trade that places thou-
sands of dollars on the line will affect you quite differently.
Your trading plan should provide at least a basic guide toward
your continuing education. Many traders will be drawn toward trad-
ing clubs but approach them with care. Some trading clubs will sell
you their preferred trading products or require that you pool your
money with other club members for club trades. Pooled funds are
traded as club trades and are often decided by the membership
through a consensus vote. It would be diffi cult to think of a worse
approach for deciding on trades. In our experience, the consensus
is usually arrived at by one of two means. The fi rst is the infl uence
exerted by the most outspoken members. This is nothing more than
putting your money into a nonregulated mutual fund with amateur
managers who get their authority from the silent acquiescence of
the rest of the club. The second way to reach club consensus is
to take the path of least resistance in order not to offend anyone.
Since the goal is to minimize risk, these trades will track the indices

or slightly lag. The club thinks the market will be rising so they buy
a position in the DIAs (the Dow Jones Industrial Average tracking
stock). Do you really need a club to help you decide to invest in the
broad market? The better choice is to fi nd reputable education on
your own and continue to invest in your personal development.
2. Funding
Deciding how much to trade with and where the funds will come
from are critical decisions as you start trading. As a general rule,
most people should not trade with more than about 20 percent of
their overall investment portfolio. This is a very broad statement and
should be adjusted for such factors as age, time to retirement, risk
tolerance, and total net worth. Most brokerage fi rms have a mini-
mum account balance that is required for a trading account. How-
ever, some of these minimums are as low as $ 500. It ’s diffi cult to
assign a threshold for funding your fi rst trading account but $ 5000
to $ 10,000 is the minimum that we generally recommend. To apply a
baseball analogy, successful trading is about hitting singles and dou-
bles. When a trader starts out with an underfunded account, the
tendency is toward either extreme of (1) not swinging at all for fear
of striking out or (2) swinging for the home run in order to grow
the account as quickly as possible. The fi rst extreme manifests itself
in the trader who is afraid to trade. When they fi nally place a trade,
they ’ re unable to take a loss if the trade moves against them. They use
the reasoning that they have to hold on and hope the stock recovers,
because they can’ t afford to lose money in the account. The second
extreme is the trader who decides to buy 50 out - of - the - money option
contracts because they ’ re so cheap. A better choice might be to buy
50 lottery tickets. The odds of making money on a single trade aren ’t
too far apart, but the lottery payout is higher.
Don ’t take lightly the decision of when to add money to the
account or when to transfer money out of the account. The rules for
this decision should be clearly started in your trading plan in order to
avoid being driven by your emotions. There is a strong temptation for
traders to prop up their trading account when they ’ re losing money
because they can afford to. This is especially true for high- net - worth
traders. They don’ t experience the same proportional pain of loss
that others do, so they’ ll continually transfer funds into their trad-
ing account in order to hold on to a losing trade or to speculate on

high - risk trades. In Las Vegas, these characters are referred to as
“ whales. ” They ’ re the ones who will continue placing bets, even
though they lose money, for the sheer entertainment of the bet.
Hoteliers love these people and will provide free rooms, escorts,
meals, and entertainment as long as they play. Wall Street provides
the same type of venue for masses of traders who feed the market in
spite of their inability to profi t. And they don ’t even offer you a good
meal in return— go fi gure.
There comes a time when you’ ve diligently applied yourself to
this endeavor called trading and you’ re making a profi t. You should
also have rules for transferring funds out of your trading account
into other investments. If you’ re more successful in your trading
account than your other investments, your trading account will even-
tually grow beyond the 20 percent rule we discussed earlier. Does
this mean you should trade your entire portfolio? The answer is no,
because trading carries a different type and level of risk. You may be
outperforming the market and tempted to trade your entire port-
folio, but resist the urge. Most traders go through swings between
outperforming the broad market and underperforming the broad
market. Sometimes this is due to market forces such as a shift into
a sideways market when your trading skills work best in a trending
market. Other times, this may be due to personal forces such as fam-
ily stress or health issues. Having a portion of your portfolio in such
investments as bonds, index funds, or real estate will serve to balance
the risks and returns through various market conditions.
3. Goals and Objectives
Why do you trade? This needs to be specifi cally addressed in your
trading plan. There is no right or wrong answer to this question as
long as you’ re honest with yourself. Is your goal to be a full- time
trader? What’ s your plan for transitioning from your current income
source to trading? Have you talked to others who trade full time or
have made the attempt and failed? You are not the fi rst person to
enter this fi eld. Many have tried, with varying degrees of success.
Learn as much as you can from the experiences of others. One of
the key considerations in trading full time is the need to generate a
profi t consistently. Many traders are profi table when they trade part -
time but begin to lose money when they start trading full- time. The
reason is quite simple: The pressure that comes from using your

trades as your sole income source often causes you to make bad
emotional decisions. It’ s similar to the underfunded trader. Neither
of you believe that you can afford a loss so you do everything you
can to avoid it. The part- time trader can afford to go for long peri-
ods without placing a trade; preferring to wait for a low - risk, high -
reward setup. However, the full- time trader knows that he won’ t
make any money if he ’s not trading, so he fi nds trades whether they
exist or not.
Many traders simply use trading as a way to outperform the broad
market. Their goal is not to be fi nancially independent through
trading or to build profi ts for a specifi c reward like a new boat or
home. They want the ability to use their own research and judgment
and direct a portion of their portfolio into opportunities that they’ ve
identifi ed. This is one of the most conservative trading strategies
and, as such, one of the most attainable goals. The decision rule
for when it’ s time to stop trading becomes easy. You allow yourself a
certain amount of time to learn the skills and reach your objective. If
after one year, for example, you ’ re still underperforming the broad
market, then stop trading. Decide whether you need to learn more
or end your trading altogether. If you can’ t beat the broad market,
why not just invest your money in a low- cost index fund? It requires
none of your time and attention and you ’ ll pay lower fees.
4. Markets and Products
As part of your trading plan, you need to decide what and where you
will be trading. Stocks are the easiest products for most people to
understand and begin trading. Included in the stock category are
exchange - traded funds (ETFs). These are essentially mutual funds that
trade just like stocks. Traditional mutual funds are priced and traded
once a day at net asset value (NAV). The NAV is calculated after the
markets close by benchmarking the closing price of all the constituent
stocks within the fund. Any buy or sell orders entered during the day
are then executed after the NAV is calculated. ETFs, however, trade
throughout the day and may be bought and sold just like stocks. You
may be familiar with some ETFs without realizing what they are. For
example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average can ’t be traded directly.
However, you can trade the DIA ETF (referred to as the Diamonds),
which follows the value of the index (see Figure 1.4 ). The Nasdaq 100
may be traded through the QQQQ ETF (the Q’ s ) and the S & P 500

Figure 1.4 Dow Jones Industrial 30 versus DIA ETF
Index has the SPY ETF (the Spyders). Besides indices, ETFs are often
used to trade specifi c sectors or industries. You can trade the biotech
sector, for example, with the ETF ticker symbol BBH.
Traders will often graduate into options after learning the basics
of stocks. It’ s important to understand stock trading before trading
options because part of the options pricing model is the price of the
underlying stock. If you don’ t understand the nature of price move-
ment with stocks, you’ ll only magnify your confusion when you trade
options. Having a plan to transition into options will help you avoid
making the move too early. As we discussed earlier in this chapter,
there are many so- called experts who will try to convince you that
options (or gold or currencies or futures— you get the idea) are the
path to riches. You ’ ll be sorely tempted to drop your current trad-
ing strategy and style and follow their 12- step plan. If you decide
to trade various products, then develop a plan for each. Each plan
should include the salient points we’ re covering in this discussion
and should stand alone. Your funding requirements for your futures
trading will likely be different than the funding requirements for
your stock trading. Likewise, if you ’ re highly leveraged through
futures trading, you should expect better returns than simply out-
performing the broad market. The risk you assume should have a
corresponding level of return.
Your trading plan should identify which market you plan to trade.
Of course, this is often determined by the product. Some stocks only

trade on the Nasdaq exchange while others trade on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE). Many traders around the world will trade
their local exchanges for such products as contracts for difference
(CFDs) while also trading the U.S. markets for the liquidity offered.
The consideration of which market to trade is not as signifi cant as it
once was. There was a time when the execution difference between
virtual markets and physical markets was drastic. Technology has
created a forced leveling and the historic differences are becoming
less of an issue.
5. Trade Setup and Execution
It may seem intuitive to defi ne the process by which trades are identi-
fi ed and executed while ignoring the other trading plan components
discussed in this chapter. Lest we gloss over this important concept, the
following is an outline of the salient points to consider in this section:
Time horizon. You must decide in advance how long the trade will
be held. Do not change time horizons in the middle of a
trade to accommodate a bad trade. This is quite different
from riding a profitable trade. Don ’t exit a winning position
just to satisfy your defined holding period, but don’ t become
an investor because you ’r e a bad trader.
Stock screening . How are you going to pare down the population
of thousands of stocks into a pool that you can reasonably
analyze for trading? Are you a trend trader, or will you be
trading channels, or both? Are you going to attempt to pick
reversals? Will you screen stocks for large- capitalization com-
panies, or will you be speculating with penny stocks?
Pretrade analysis. Charts are the primary tool of technical analysis,
but there are many variations to charts and techniques for
using them. Candlestick charts are the personal favorite of
many traders, but some people will swear by point - and - figure
charts because they remove the time scale from the analysis.
Once you choose a charting style, what indicators and entry/
exit rules will you apply?
Risk analysis . Knowing when to exit a losing trade is one of the
most important skills that a trader develops from experience.
However, the beginning trader must define risk management
rules from the first trade. Are you going to use The Market

Guys ’ 1% Rule or do you have another risk tolerance level
that you ’ ll apply? You need to decide how you ’ ll protect an
open position. For example, a long stock position could be
protected with a long put option or a sell stop order.
Position sizing. Some traders answer this question by looking at
how much they can afford. We recommend tying your posi-
tion size into your risk tolerance and have provided guid-
ance to accomplish that later in the book. Your trading plan
should include rules for your position size, including adding
to the position as well as exiting the position. Remember, if
you buy 1,000 shares, there’ s no requirement that you sell all
1,000 shares at the same time.
Trade execution. Finally, consider how your trade will be executed.
You may have different rules for different market conditions.
For example, some traders will use limit orders only in the first
and last half hour of trading to help protect against the higher
volatility found during these periods. Some traders enter a
position with a market order and exit with limit orders.
6. Trade Diary
Knowing exactly how profi table you are through trading is critical
for improving. The best way to keep tabs on your profi ts and growth
is through a detailed trading diary. The trading diary will help you
identify what works and what doesn’ t . Along with that, it will quickly
show you when your trading strategy is starting to break down. Some
traders employ a strategy that performs remarkably well in a bull
market but underperforms in a sideways or bear market. Your trad-
ing diary will be the fi rst to fl ag you when conditions are changing
and you need to adjust your strategy.
There is no limit to the information that you choose to log into
your trading diary, although it is possible to overanalyze your per-
formance and spend more time with your spreadsheets and less time
with the markets. Whatever your predisposition may be toward self -
analysis, the following is a suggested minimum list of information
that your diary should contain:

Grow with Your Plan
As we wrap up this discussion of the trading plan, there is one more
important point that needs to be made. The trading plan should serve
to make you a better trader and guide you through your growth. It is
by no means a malevolent dictator that, once created, must be served
without question. You’ ll fi nd that your trading plan will evolve over
time, refl ecting your increase of both knowledge and experience. It
represents your best effort at a set of rules that you believe will help
you reach maximum profi tability. However, it is a snapshot frozen in
time. As you continue trading, you may fi nd products that are more
profi table for you. Some traders are most profi table in sideways mar-
kets when they learn to trade options. They don’ t enjoy the same
success with stocks, which may be what they started trading. There’ s
no problem with making the change as long as you develop a new
plan. We ’ ve known many traders who were lured into the markets by
the promise of quick riches that were supposedly available to anyone
willing to commit to day trading full time. Reality set in very quickly,
and these same traders discovered that trading was more profi table
for them if they lengthened their time horizon from minutes to
weeks. Once again, it is perfectly acceptable to switch from being a
day trader to a swing trader if you ’ ve developed a plan to do so.
Your trading diary will be your feedback loop for changes that
you ’ ll make to your trading approach. Look for the patterns that tell
you what time of day is best to enter an opening trade, which prod-
ucts produce the best returns, or when it’ s just time to take a break
and regroup. The markets will always be changing; be sure you
change with them.

Are You Out of Your Mind?
HOW TO WORK WITH YOUR EMOTIONS
W
ithout question, the biggest challenge for any new trader is
learning how to remove emotions from the decision- making p rocess
when it comes time to make a trade. It really doesn’ t matter how
much experience you have; you will fi nd that this will be your biggest
battle when trading the markets. If you were to ask a seasoned trader
if they are able to completely remove the emotions associated with
risk positions they’ ve taken in the market, and they answered “ yes, ”
then they would be lying to you. We have seen it time after time, over
many years in the market, people coming to us with the same story
. . . “ I don’ t believe it. I was up 50 percent on this stock last week
and now I ’ m down. I can’ t take a loss now. I ’ ll just hold on a little bit
more and see what happens.” Throughout this chapter, we’ ll discuss
ways to keep our emotions in check and f ollow our trading plan. As
you ’ ll see, in the trading business you may actually profi t from being
out of your mind!
Avoiding Pain, Seeking Pleasure
It is well documented among many scientifi c studies that our brains
are designed to direct us away from pain and toward pleasure. So
one of the reasons people hold on to a losing trade is that it ’s the
brain ’s way of avoiding pain. Hoping for a breakeven point is an
idea people have that gives them pleasure when they think that “ one
day ” they will not have to take the loss. If this is the way you have

been t hinking, then rest assured you are in good company. It doesn’ t
mean you are doing the right thing, but you are in good company.
Since your brain is wired to avoid the pain, it will look for ways
to get around having to take the loss. I ’ m sure you have heard of
how, when we feel threatened, our survival instincts tell us to fi ght
when we ’ re in danger in order to defend ourselves, or run from a
situation that could result in our being harmed. Blood moves from
the extremities of our bodies to the critical organs and muscles that
bring us to “ fi ght - or - fl ight ” mode. The fi ght- or - fl ight response, also
known as the acute stress response, was fi rst discovered by Walter
Cannon back in 1929. His theory talked about how animals react to
threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system,
priming the animal for fi ghting or fl eeing. In extremely danger-
ous situations, our bodies go into shock and adrenaline is released
into our bloodstream, giving us extraordinary strength that helps
us in our defense. You don ’t even have to think about it. When we
are threatened, our bodies naturally adjust and our minds quickly
throw us into autopilot. Over time, we have learned that our quick
reactions help guide us to safety. However, while in fi ght mode, we
will naturally take a stance to defend ourselves when our backs are
against the wall.
But what happens when our fi nancial lives are in danger? If you
have ever found yourself in a losing position in the market, and in
fi nancial danger, you may have noticed the physical changes that
take place in your body. Your heartbeat increases, your blood pres-
sure goes up, you perspire uncontrollably, and your stomach muscles
tighten up, not to mention the loss of sleep from the added stress.
Sound familiar? These symptoms are very close to what you would
experience in a fi ght - or - fl ight response.
When faced with having to take a loss, you would rather fl ee
from the threat of having to take a fi nancial loss and go with some-
thing that sounds better like “ dollar cost averaging. ” Yeah, that ’s a
great idea. Let ’s buy more of the stock that’ s been beating the pants
off of us. Then you think, “ If I cost average down, then I ’ ll only have
to climb up half the distance to get back to my breakeven point. ”
What happens next? The market takes another turn for the worse,
and you realize that you can’ t run from this situation, so you go into
fi ght mode. This is when you decide once again to buy more, at
new lows, because you absolutely refuse to take a loss at this point.
You begin to think that what started out as a short- term trade is now

better suited for a long - term investment, and you start looking for
good things about this company to justify reasons why you should
hold on to it for a couple of years. You have just committed one of
the great mortal sins of trading, which is changing your strategy to
justify a loss.
As you can see, our survival instincts don’ t really help us in the
fi nancial markets. First, we are not able to fl ee from big losses when
we are under attack. Secondly, the market is just too big for us to
fi ght. So the next best thing we can do is learn as much as we can
about this beast we call The Market. Once we understand what the
market is capable of and how it can hurt us, then we can approach
it with caution in order to better defend ourselves against an attack
before it happens.
Piloting Your Trades
The fi rst step toward avoiding a catastrophic loss is learning how
to deal with the emotions associated with trading. One of the best
ways to understand how important it is to remove our emotions from
the decision- making process is to compare trading with fl ying an air-
plane. We ’ ve found that there are a large number of pilots who show
up in The Market Guys’ audience, and both of the authors are pilots,
so it ’s easy for us to use this analogy.
When fl ying a plane, safety is the pilot ’s paramount consid-
eration. Let’ s face it, if you take off from the ground only to fi nd
later that you didn ’t have enough fuel in your plane, you’ re going
to be in trouble. So every pilot is required to go through a prefl ight
checklist: fuel, brakes, seat belts, and so on. Making sure that your
engines are running properly and that you have a backup plan in
case you have engine failure is part of every pilot ’s checklist. One
of the reasons checklists are so important is that our minds will play
tricks on us from time to time. If we rely solely on our memories,
then it will only be a matter of time before one of life’ s distractions
gets in the way and causes us to forget a minor little detail like mak-
ing sure the landing gear is down before touchdown.
Now let ’s compare this to trading. How often do you use a
checklist before putting your money at risk? Do you check to see
if the stock is going up before you buy it or are you busy trying to
pick a bottom in order to get a bargain price? If you regularly try
to pick bottoms as a strategy, then you are letting your emotions

get in the way of the decision - making process, because what you are
really saying is, “ I think this stock has hit its low and I believe it will
go higher from here. ” In this case, it’ s your opinion that you are
trusting and not the actual facts of what’ s happening with the stock.
That ’s like a pilot s aying, “ I am going to head north even though I
should be heading west because I think the wind is going to change
direction after I get in the air. Let’ s take off and see what happens.”
Who is going to get in a plane with this kind of pilot? We’ re not, and
neither should you.
Another dangerous condition that pilots are challenged with
from time to time is when the body plays tricks on the mind. Natu-
rally, our body senses when gravity is pulling us to the ground. If you
were in an elevator, you could generally discern, even with your eyes
closed, whether you were going up or down. Going up, you would
feel your body getting heavier; going down you would feel lighter.
Your ears would pop and your senses would tell you that there is a
change in your altitude. The same thing happens in a plane. If you
were to close your eyes in a plane and then initiate a slight turn
to the left or right, your body would tell your mind that you were
gaining altitude. The forces acting on your body from being in a
turn push you down in the seat and trick your mind into thinking
that this added weight, like in an elevator, is the result of gaining
altitude. This, of course, would be a lie. Night fl ying or fl ying in
overcast conditions can be a very dangerous place for a pilot who is
not aware that her body is lying to her. Experienced pilots are fully
aware of this, and when they sense that their bodies are tricking
their minds, they immediately force themselves to refer to their
instrument panel to get the truth. The instruments will tell pilots
if they are in a turn or in a climb. Instruments also tell them what
direction they are heading.
We can apply this analogy to the trader who is taking risk in
the market because of the similarities in how our minds inter-
pret the data. If you, a trader, decided to go with a feeling instead
of looking at the truth seen in price trends, you may be fooled
into thinking that your money is in a safe place when, in fact, you
are heading in the wrong direction. We have seen many people
crash and burn in the market because they bought a stock on a
broker recommendation or because an analyst upgraded a par-
ticular company. Then, when the stock drops 30, 40, 50 percent
or more, they hold on because they believe in the story of the

company. How many times have you seen a p erson buy a stock
just before an earnings announcement because they heard an
analyst say that they expected the company to report stronger -
than - expected earnings? After the stock beats the earnings estimate
like the analyst expected, the stock plunges to a new 52- week low.
This happens more often than you would imagine, and the r eason
people lose money in situations like this is that they are t rading on a
feeling. Like the pilot, we need to focus on the instrument panel to
get the truth and not rely on what our minds are telling us. For the
trader, our instrument panel is the price chart.
Technical Analysis or Tea Leaves?
For many years technical analysts were met with resistance from the
diehard fundamental analysts who labeled them as fortune- tellers
who might as well use tea leaves to predict the market. Price charts
were looked upon as crystal balls that added little value to the world
of money managers. However, in July 2000 a fi nancial earthquake
shook up the fi nancial world. Fundamental analysts ran for the hills
as Lucent Technology news hit the market, causing this former Bell
Labs gem of a stock to drop its share price by more than 91 percent
in less than a year. Not too long after that, in October 2001, a com-
pany called Enron announced more than $ 600 million in quarterly
losses, sparking a national investigation of its leadership team. That
triggered the beginning of the end for employees and sharehold-
ers alike. Then, when you thought it couldn’ t get any worse, it did.
WorldCom, the world ’s second largest long distance carrier, fi led the
largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in July 2002.
For the fi rst time in history, fundamental analysis came under
attack as senators and government offi cials questioned the validity
of company reports and analyst forecasts. Investigators started hold-
ing up price charts during investigative hearings, asking analysts and
company executives why they did not see this coming. They held these
price charts up to the cameras, showing signifi cant downward trends.
“ Would you buy a stock like this? ” was the oft - repeated question.
From that point on, technical analysis became less of a forecast-
ing tool and more of a risk management tool. We will be covering the
basic ideas behind technical analysis in Chapter 4 . For now, under-
stand that it helps us remove our emotions from the decision - making
process. This is especially crucial when we have money on the line.

Fundamental Seduction
Whether we are in the United States, Europe, or Asia speaking at
trade shows or expositions, someone always steps up during one of
these events to ask, “ What about the fundamentals? Don ’t you guys
even look at the company reports?” Our answer is always the same.
Yes, we look at the fundamentals to see if our stock candidate has
earnings and we check to see how much debt they are carrying on the
books. Many times, the company reports tell us which stocks to trade,
but the fundamentals never give us the signals that tell us when to
get into a position. More importantly, the fundamentals don’ t tell us
when to get out when the position is turning against us. By the time
the accountants update the reports that go to the analysts, the price
move will have already taken place. Are you really going to wait until
the end of the quarter to make the decision to get out when a stock is
moving against you? Of course not, and this is why we focus so much
of our attention on the price action.
The other reason we put less weight into the fundamentals is that
there is too much information out there. You will see that once you
have an opinion about a stock, your mind will search for information
in order to support your opinion. For example, you think the stock
is going to go higher and you’ ve read the opinions of the Wall Street
analysts who also think this stock is going higher. So, you buy it. Next
week, you look at the stock only to see that it is now trading at a lower
price than where you bought it. At this point you are not too worried
because you have faith in the report you’ ve read and you see that
the company had very strong sales numbers last quarter. The next
week, the stock price continues to fall. In desperation, you reach for
the company report. Once again you take another look at the price-
to - earnings ratio (P/E) and see that its earnings continue to be
strong. In fact, it has a lower P/E than the rest of the stocks in that
sector. So you make the decision to hold on.
Do you see what has just happened? Your opinion caused you to
search for more data to justify your reasons to hold on. This informa-
tion overload, combined with your getting involved with the product
or service of this company, has caused you to fall in love with this
stock. Don ’t marry your stock positions because they usually won’ t
remain faithful. The longer you hold on to them when they are
going down, the harder it will be for you to separate yourself from
the losers when you are wrong.

Learning how to take small losses along the way is a great way to
avoid getting attached to your portfolio. True traders look at the
numbers with the realization that they are going to be wrong every
once in a while. In fact, there may be times when they are wrong
multiple times in a row. However, accepting this ahead of time makes
it easier for the trader to take the loss, knowing that the goal is to
keep the losses small along the way. We will be talking more about
this in Chapter 12 when we cover the 1% Rule for risk management.
Learning to take small losses along the way is something many
people are challenged with because they have associated realized
loss with pain. Remember what we said about how the mind moves
away from pain and t oward things of pleasure? To fi x this you must
learn how to fi nd pleasure in taking a small loss. Refusing to take a
loss is like a fi ghter getting into the ring with his opponent, thinking he
is never going to get punched in the face. A good fi ghter learns how
to a bsorb a blow by moving with the punch, and this allows him to
continue on with the fi ght. A trader learns how to take small losses,
which allows him to hold on to his trading capital so he can get back
into the market without getting knocked out. Reward yourself after
you have taken a small loss, and don’ t look back at the trade to see
what might have happened had you held on.
There will be times when you sell a stock at a loss, and immedi-
ately after you sell it, the stock rallies. However, looking back at your
stocks to see if you made the right decision will only condition you
to hold on to the losers. There may be occasions when the stock will
drop in price and 12 months later it will be higher than where you
sold it. But would you have really held on to it for a year to get back
into the positive side of the trade? This is not what a professional
trader would do, so you shouldn ’t do this either.
Using Best Practices
One of the things that we’ ve found most helpful for our students is
having them put a trading plan together. As we covered in the fi rst
chapter, you should have a trading plan in place before you execute
your fi rst trade. Your trading plan should be written down, clearly

articulated, with no gray areas. When you have identifi ed your exit
points, make sure you post them in a place that is clearly visible,
preferably somewhere near your trading computer, and be sure to
stick with the plan.
Another good idea that will help you hold steady in your mind-
set as a trader is to ask for the help of a close friend or spouse. You
may be surprised to know that husband- and - wife teams work very
well. Right about now, all of the husbands are thinking, “ There is
no way I ’ m going to have my wife on this account with me — she ’ d
kill me if she knew how much money I lost last month. ” This may
come as a surprise to a lot of the male traders out there, but women
often make better traders than men because most women will not
ride a loss as far as a man would. Men have a greater tendency to
fi ght the market when things turn against us. The next time you
feel the urge to ride a loss in an effort to fi ght your way back to the
breakeven point, try to remember that the market is too big for you
to fi ght. If you still fi nd that you are challenged in this area, then
have a friend, partner, or trading buddy hold you accountable for
your actions.
In other words, if you say you are going to get out of a position at
a certain price level, then stick to it and have your partner hold you to
it. Professional fl oor traders and market makers report to head trad-
ers who hold them accountable, so why shouldn’ t you have someone
you can check in with? The fact is that many trading fi rms around
the world will not allow their traders to take large positions home
with them overnight because it adds too much risk to the fi rm.
The Business of Trading
If you plan on taking your trading strategy seriously, then you must
think of this as if you were starting a new business. If you are fortu-
nate enough to know someone who is a professional trader, ask him
if you can visit his offi ce. Take a look with your own eyes at how the
trading fl oors operate. If you get the opportunity to meet the head
traders, make sure you ask them how they monitor risk. These peo-
ple pay for their salaries over and over again each month when they
do what ’s expected of them. That job, once again, is to limit losses.
Every entrepreneur knows that there are start - up costs involved
in any new venture, and it is highly unlikely that a new business will
make a profi t right away. In fact, most new businesses only begin

to see profi ts a year or two after their doors are opened. As you
are starting out in your new trading business, you should have the
same mind - set as other entrepreneurs. The price of a new computer
system, the books and tapes you add to your library, the seminars you
attend — these are all part of the start- up costs. Just be c areful you are
not spending too much money on the seminar circuit. On that note,
make sure you are getting your information only from experts who
are walking the walk and not just talking the talk. The Market Guys
spend many months on the road each and every year attending
trade shows and money expos. It ’s shocking to see just how many
snake oil salesmen are out there. In fact, we were once in a show
in Frankfurt, Germany, where one of the trade show booths had
a vodka bar set up right in the middle of the fl oor with tables all
around it. We walked around the bar to peek our heads in to see just
how many cases of booze there were in their i nventory. While this
was a business model we would never endorse, the fact is there are
many companies out there who are in the seminar b usiness just to
get your money.
We make it a point to tell everyone in our audience to make
sure they vet their source before buying any material that shows you
how to make a profi t. Before you take trading advice from some-
one, please do yourself a favor and make sure you are dealing with
individuals who are putting their money on the line when they are
trading the market. Also, make sure they are willing to share the bad
trades as well as the good trades with you. How many times have you
seen an ad in a magazine or a commercial on television proclaiming
that you can make 200 to 300 percent profi ts by using their system?
Or the infomercials given by someone who was once homeless and
living on a park bench but now makes millions of dollars trading
spreads in the options markets overnight? Can you make millions
trading options? Yes, you can. But let ’s get real — relying on television
commercials that play on your emotions is not the way to go.
We’ ll assume that if you are reading this book right now you
have checked out the credibility of The Market Guys and our Keep
It Super Simple (KISS) method of trading. We are very proud to say
that our approach to risk management has resulted in many success
stories around the world. Our favorite stories are not the ones that
talk about fabulous profi ts but the stories that talk about the end of
losses. When a trader comes to us and tells us that they are no longer
losing money, we know they ’ re now on the path to profi ts.

36 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
Overcoming Fear and Greed
We have already addressed how pain and pleasure motivate us to
make certain decisions, so now let’ s talk about two cousins: fear
and greed. We fear the pain that we want to avoid, and we become
greedy for the pleasure that attends to a winning trade. Let’ s
explore how these emotions work in our trading and how we can
overcome them.
The more powerful of the two is fear. Fear is one reason why
most people will avoid buying a stock on its high. The large majority
of amateur traders would feel more comfortable buying a stock on a
52 - week low rather than a 52- week high. The reason for this behavior
is that the trader has a mind - set that says, “ If I buy this stock on its
high, it could fall. So, I ’ ll wait for it to drop some before I buy it.”
This is the fear emotion working against you. If you think about what
you are doing when you wait for a stock to drop before you buy it, you
will see that you ’ re really waiting for the sellers to control the stock.
In order for a stock price to drop, the sellers have to take control of
the price. Conversely, if the buyers were in control, the stock price
would rise. Therefore, you are buying a stock that is weakening.
When you compare this way of thinking to that of a professional
trader, you will see that a seasoned trader would feel very comfort-
able buying a stock on its high because their mind- set is to Buy High
and Sell Higher. In other words, buy the stock when it is being con-
trolled by the buyers, and you will be getting into a stock that is
strengthening. Stocks that are in growth mode will continue to set
new highs. If a stock is going to move from a low point to a higher
point, it will set new highs all along the way! If a professional trader
sees a stock that has been going up in a nice steady trend, they are
confi dent in their own decisions because there is a good chance that
the stock will continue up. If they make a bad choice and the stock
drops in price after they buy it, then they simply get out with a small
loss and move on to the next stock. Successful traders have a simple
strategy: Buy strength and sell weakness. You can’ t make it any sim-
pler than that.
Another characteristic we often observe in new traders is how
fear leads to overanalysis. When you are unsure of your knowledge,
strategy, or ability to pick a good stock, you will continue to ques-
tion yourself. This type of fear will cause you to go back and check
out the company a little bit more. You might fi nd yourself digging

into the company report to verify earnings once again, or you
might hammer away at a few more analyst reports to see if there is
anything that would negate your reasons for buying this company.
Before you know it, you have spent so much time analyzing and
probing that the stock has already made its move up. Then you
wind up saying to yourself, “ It ’s too high now. Let me wait and see
what happens. ”
Have you ever heard the old saying, “ Overanalysis equals paraly-
sis? ” It’ s true, and the underlying cause of this paralysis is fear. You
may have lost money in the past after you bought a stock on a high
and you are fearful that it will happen again, so you refrain from
looking at any stock that ’s on a 52- week high. You respond quite like
a child who once got burned on a stove. Any child who burns himself
on a stove will most likely not want to get close to that stove again.
This is a natural response part of a self- defense system. It teaches us
lessons when we experience pain. Every time we feel pain, the mind
remembers the event that caused the pain and then transforms that
memory into a fear that shapes our behavior patterns. This is noth-
ing more than a conditioned response.
Greed also conditions our behavior in harmful ways. If you have
ever tasted the sweetness of a profi t after buying a stock and shortly
after you sell, it rallies to even higher levels, you will know what we’ re
taking about here. Once you’ ve tasted it, you want it over and over
again. Unfortunately, those home - run trades only come once in a
while. But as a result of your tasting this sweetness, you will fi nd that
a pattern forms where you wind up holding on to those losing stocks
longer than you should.
Another reason people hold on to losing trades is that greed
has caused them to believe that this losing stock is going to come
back soon and launch just like that winning stock did. If you ’ re not
careful, this risky behavior pattern will wind up costing you money
like a one- armed bandit in a Las Vegas casino. We often travel to Las
Vegas to speak at fi nancial and trading shows, and it never ceases to
amaze us how those slot machines captivate people. We assume that
most people know that the odds are stacked heavily on the side of
the casino, yet thousands of people sit there for hours as they put in
their coins, waiting for big payoffs.
If you took a psychology course in college, you may remember
the name Ivan Pavlov. In 1904, Ivan Pavlov won the Nobel Prize in
physiology/medicine for his research on digestion. The work he did

with his dogs made him a household name as he documented how
our nervous systems trigger certain refl exes. The similarity between
Pavlov ’s dogs and the Las Vegas gambler is uncanny, and it’ s a
short trip from trader to gambler. Before you reject the connection
between the behavior patterns of the Vegas gambler and the market
trader, remember that pleasure and greed are akin to one another.
Both emotions drive us toward behavior that may ultimately harm us
more than help us. It’ s important that you know this; if you ignore
this fact, you may wind up unexpectedly gambling your fi nancial
future away.
Pavlov ’s work involved a metronome and dog food. He would
sound the metronome at the same time he gave food to the experi-
mental dogs. After a short while, the dogs, which previously salivated
only when they saw and ate their food, would begin to salivate when
the metronome sounded. He also found that the dogs would salivate
after he rang the bell even if there were no food present. He pub-
lished these results in 1903, calling it a conditioned refl ex. This is
different than an innate refl ex, which is what a child would do if he
touched a hot stove. This pain again teaches the child and a valuable
lesson is learned. Pavlov called this learning process conditioning,
and he also found that the conditioned refl ex will be repressed if
the positive stimulus, in the metronome sounding, proved wrong too
often. In other words, if the metronome sounded repeatedly without
any food appearing, the dogs would eventually stop salivating at the
sound.
Can you see the similarity between Pavlov ’s dogs and the Las
Vegas gambler sitting at the slot machine? The casino is playing with
the gambler like Pavlov experimented with his dogs. The behavior
exhibited by the gambler of putting dollars into the slot is rewarded
with a treat that amounts to a small payoff of coins from the machine.
As coins fall into the coin tray, the bells ring and the behavior contin-
ues. After a while, another small payoff arrives and more bells sound,
but this time the gambler has less money.
As time goes on, these small payoffs result in our sample gam-
bler believing that she will continue to be rewarded and she starts
to salivate with greed. Like Pavlov ’s dogs, she salivates even if there
was no reward. This is the same reason why a trader will hold on to
a losing trade even if there is no reward. Greed drives us to hold on
to our losses, and if we continue to let greed take over, we will get to
a point where one of two things will happen. Either the pain will get

too great to hold on any longer or you will run out of money and
blow up your trading account.
So how does one break out of this vicious circle? The fi rst step
is to admit when you are wrong and pull away from the stocks that
are costing you money time after time. This will be very diffi cult at
fi rst because most people don ’t like to admit when they are wrong.
In fact, many traders feel that they have to go back and defeat the
stock that cost them their profi t, and it becomes some sort of duel
they play with the market. Their new goal is not to make a profi t but
rather to get back what they lost. Then, if they are lucky enough to
get back to the breakeven point, they walk away feeling like a winner.
Once you come to the realization that you are on the wrong side of a
losing position, you can start fresh with a new list of stocks.
Filtering Your Emotion
If you are looking for ways to help remove the emotions associated
with trading, you must fi rst make sure to fi lter your thoughts. Make
sure you are analyzing your stocks for their trend value. Rate your
stocks from 1 to 5, giving your stock a score of 1 if the trend is nice
and steady with a long history of consistency. If the trend is too
extreme, meaning you are a buyer and the price chart is going up
vertically, then give it a 3. If you are a buyer and the stock is going
down, you may throw that one off your list or give it a 5.
Then you would measure the emotional value of that same stock
on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 representing a very high emotional
charge. If you are picking up a stock because you heard Slim Trainer
mention it on that stock show Crazy Money, we would rate that at the
top of the emotional scorecard by giving it a 5. On the other hand, if
you got a hot stock tip from your brother- in - law Pete, we would rate
that with a 3 because, although your brother- in - law knows a lot about
the market, chances are he has already bought into the story of the
company without even checking a price chart to see if the trend of
the stock was up.
Once you have these two numbers, total them up for each stock.
The stocks with the lowest numbers are your best choices. The best
score you can get for a stock is a 2. This represents a stock with
a great trend (score of 1) and no emotional charge (score of 1).
Using fi lters like this will gradually help you develop the mind - set
you need to become a highly successful trader.

Case Studies
Dan
Over the years we have helped many people reach their ultimate
fi nancial goals. Nothing makes us happier than when we meet peo-
ple like Dan.
Dan was a house painter in the Washington, D.C., area who had
a goal to make a million dollars in the stock market. Like a lot of
people who are new to the market, Dan was hoping to get advice
from the broker he had his account with. He assumed that his bro-
ker would be able to tell him how to trade and invest in the markets,
and he was excited about the opportunities. One day, Dan made
an appointment to visit a representative who worked for a so- called
full - service brokerage fi rm. This company claimed to be one of the
world ’s leading fi nancial management and advisory companies, so
Dan thought he had found the right place. However, when he told
this particular representative what his plan was, the representative
laughed when he saw Dan’ s check for $ 2,000. “ Sir, ” he said, “ if this is
what you plan on opening your account with, then we would suggest
you take your $ 2,000 and go to Las Vegas with it. You ’ ll have a better
chance reaching your goal there. ” Outraged, Dan stormed out of the
offi ce and down the road to a broker who would take his money.
Fortunately, Dan did not give up so easily. He spent time learning
how to trade options and the importance of having a good risk man-
agement plan in place. He had early success in the fi rst six months
of trading, and this allowed him to put a plan together to build his
dream house. His plan was to make money each month in the option
markets, and each month he would take some of his profi ts and
put it toward the construction of his new home. He didn’ t want a
mortgage in the end, so he decided to buy the land fi rst. The next
month, he made enough in the markets to build a foundation, and
each month after that, he would add something to the house. One
day, he called to tell us the roof was on. This was a big deal for him
because the rain was no longer beating down on the frame of his new
home. He referred to his new status simply as “ dry. ” Later in the same
year, he called to give us an update and said that he was ready to put
on the front door. He said, “ I want a big double wooden door— one
that is warm and beautiful, a door that makes people feel welcomed
when they knock on it.”

Dan ’s plan forced him to stay disciplined, and his mind- set
kept him from getting too attached to his stock position. He
was in love with the idea of building his dream house, instead of
being in love with his stock positions. He didn’ t want to marry his
stocks because then he would not be able to sell them to raise
enough money to build his house. He also knew that he could
not ride a loss in any one position because if he did this, he would
jeopardize the construction of this dream home and all would be
lost. Dan was able to fi nish his home, and after making over
$ 700,000 in the market in less than three years, he called to inform
us of his fi nal purchase. To complete his ultimate dream he took
some of his profi ts and purchased a brand new Mercedes Benz to
park in his new garage. The last part of his plan was the icing on
the cake, and that was to drive over to the broker who told him to
go to Las Vegas in order to show him what he had done with his
$ 2,000.
Lesley
Another success story is Lesley Fontaine. Lesley started with a rela-
tively small account and turned it into a million dollars by focusing
on price charts to help her make those all - important trading deci-
sions. For years, Lesley, by her own admission, would get emotionally
tied up in the companies she invested in. Whether it was the product
that she fell in love with or the service the company provided, her
problem was that she found herself holding on too long. She believed
strongly in the company, and it was this faith in the c ompany ’s lead-
ership team that caused Lesley to hold on when these stocks would
drop in price. Once we showed her how to remove these emotional
chains from her decision - making process, she quickly learned how
to properly enter a new position and, more importantly, how to exit
a stock when key support levels were being broken. Amazingly, this
newly acquired skill was the key that helped her reach the million-
dollar mark. We will never forget the day she achieved this milestone
because she called to play a song written by Barenaked Ladies. It was
their hit single “ If I Had $ 1,000,000. ” Her success has spread around
the world, as she is now one of our featured guests on The Mar-
ket Guys’ on - demand radio program. Her new title is the Emotional
Trader Lady!

Steve
Over the years, we have seen and heard many success stories about
people who have overcome the emotional challenges in order to reach
the pinnacle of success with regard to trading the markets. However,
with every success story we see the tragedies as well. One such per-
son, whom we will call Steve, comes to mind. Steve had a high - level
sales position with Siebel Systems (Nasdaq ticker symbol: SEBL).
The company provided businesses with customer r elationship man-
agement software and was considered to be one of the technology
darlings in the mid- to late 1990s. Seibel rewarded Steve with large
bonuses over the years, as well as stock options. Many companies pay
their sales force in stock options because it takes time for these stock
options to vest, and during this vesting period companies like Siebel
Systems are able to hold on to key producers like Steve. Should the
employee decide to leave the company, they could lose the options
that were awarded to them. So you can see how there was an incen-
tive to stay in the ranks.
As Siebel Systems continued to grow, so did Steve’ s investment
account. In fact, his account balance grew to over $ 152 million dol-
lars. Each day, we would speak with Steve to discuss ideas of how to
grow this large sum of money until one day the price of the stock
started breaking down below key support levels. We would talk about
risk management ideas such as diversifi cation, protective puts, stop
loss orders, and other things that would protect this nest egg of an
account. However, Steve was so attached to his company that he
abandoned all ideas that had anything to do with selling his stock. In
fact, his words to us still ring clear. He said, “ I know there is a chance
this stock could drop, but I am willing to pay for the growth.” You
see, Steve’ s optimism about the company and its products blinded
him to the fact that this stock was breaking down technically. The
sad part of this story is that Steve wound up losing over $ 100 million
dollars as a result of wanting to hang on.
We ran into Steve at a seminar we were doing in Washington,
D.C., a few years later and he came over to thank us for all of the
lessons we taught him over the years. But what amazes us the most is
how he was able to cope with such a loss. There were still many mil-
lions of dollars left in his account after that devastating loss but no
matter how you look at it, $ 100 million dollars was lost because of an
emotional attachment to the company he worked for.

Diane
These stories are not made up to make for an interesting book. These
are very real people, in very real situations, with very real emotions.
One of the most interesting stories of all is about a woman who lived
in Syosset, Long Island. We will call her Diane to protect her identity.
For many years, Diane and her husband owned a hardware store
not far from the Long Island Rail Road. They eventually decided to
sell their business in a plan to phase into retirement. Shortly after
they began this new chapter in their lives, her husband passed away
and she was left widowed. After careful consideration, she decided
to take some of the money she received from the sale of their hard-
ware store and invest it in a new plan for the long term. She opened
an account with a discount broker down the street and deposited
$ 200,000 with them to get things started.
Diane shopped around for a good stock to buy. She had always
heard that you should buy companies that you are familiar with, or
at least a company that has products or services that you like your-
self. Well, she always remembered liking a certain chocolate drink. It
came in a glass bottle with a yellow label, and printed in blue ink was
the word Yoo - hoo . This is the same drink that famous baseball player
Yogi Berra enjoyed, and if it was good enough for Yogi, it was good
enough for Diane, too. This is the stock that Diane wanted, so she
called up her broker and placed an order to buy $ 200,000 worth of
this one stock. Her instructions to her broker were to buy as many
shares as possible of ticker symbol YHOO with the money she had
in her account. The next day she looked at her account and saw
that the stock was up. The second and third day were the same, and
after a week of this excitement she discovered that what she thought
was Yoo - hoo, the chocolate drink, was in fact an Internet company
called Yahoo!. There was no reason to sell the stock now because
even though it was not the company she thought is was in the fi rst
place, she was making money with this fortunate mistake. In fact, she
was making a lot of money, so she held on. Three years and a series
of stock splits later, this $ 200,000 investment turned into a $ 23 mil-
lion dollar windfall. This was the good part of this unusual story, but
it didn’ t stay good for Diane because her emotional attachment later
caused her to ignore sound risk management advice.
We discussed with Diane the possibility of moving out of this
Yahoo! position and into a more diverse bond portfolio. When she

turned down that idea, we discussed protecting the position with
stop loss orders and protective puts to lock in this massive profi t.
The stock started to show signs of weakness as Internet stocks
across the board starting breaking down below key support levels.
Does this story sound familiar? Instead of removing herself from the
emotional bond she developed with this company, Diane decided to
go on a world cruise instead. To make matters even worse, Diane bor-
rowed money from the margin side of her account to purchase land
in Boca Raton, Florida, before leaving on her extended v acation.
Upon coming back from her cruise around the world, Diane was
welcomed by the news of the Internet bubble bursting and a letter
from her b roker i nforming her that she was in a margin call. This
meant that the money she had in her account, which was pure profi t
when she left on her cruise, turned into a huge debt owed to her
broker for the land that she purchased in south Florida. We can ’t
say that this story had a tragic ending because Diane was still able
to hold onto $ 2 million of her $ 23 million. If you consider that she
started by investing $ 200,000, she still did better than if she had
bought Yoo - hoo.
Why do so many people decide to hold on when things get tough?
This goes back to what we talked about in Pavlov’ s dogs. Greed does
a funny thing to us without us even realizing it, and if you are not
careful, the same things can happen to you. In the examples of the
people we’ ve talked about, these individuals were able to pull their
fi nancial lives together and live happily ever after. But what about
those individuals who have suffered and continue to suffer real
heartache because greed got the best of them?
After years in this business, we fi nd that the stories are endless.
Like Andrew in Michigan, who lost all of his mother ’s life insur-
ance benefi t because he decided to hold on to a stock even though
the stock was losing money year after year in a steady downward
spiral. Robert, in New York, sold a Wonder Bread route that he
spent 25 years building for retirement only to cash in and put all
of his $ 600,000 life savings in the market so he could turn it into
millions. Not only did he lose all of it, but he lost his marriage,
his children abandoned him, and later his health suffered greatly
because of the stress of having to deal with this fi nancial catastro-
phe. We tell these stories as often as possible so that others like you
don ’t fall into the same trap.

he debate has raged for years about the validity of trends in
the markets. In 1973, Burton Malkiel published his classic tome,
A Random Walk Down Wall Street (New York: W. W. Norton), which
essentially makes the case that past stock prices have no bearing on
future price direction. He makes the claim that at any given point in
time, a stock price has equal probability of rising or falling; therefore,
any in - depth analysis is fruitless. The prevailing long- term trend is
upward, but short- term movements within the broad trend are ran-
dom. Over 20 years later, Andrew Lo and A. Craig MacKinlay began
presenting statistical evidence to the contrary and eventually pub-
lished their own counter title, A Non - Random Walk Down Wall Street
(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999). Indeed, certain
correlations may be found and the possibility of outperforming the
broad market due to factors other than luck exists.
We want to clearly state at this point that we will not be present-
ing statistical models as the basis for this, the fi rst point in T he Market

been able to discern, any proof of random markets or weaknesses in
technical analysis will not require us to return any of our profi ts from
trading the markets.
The Crowd May Be Wrong, but They ’r e
Still the Crowd
Before we talk about trends, including how they’ re formed and
why they persist, let’ s take a micro view of a single trade. In its most
basic form, a trade is simply the pairing of a buyer and a seller. It ’s
been said that the buyer buys because he expects the price to rise
while the seller sells because he expects the price to fall. Therefore,
the conclusion is that one party or the other is always wrong. This
doesn ’t take into account the reasons behind a trade, though. Take,
for example, a situation where a trader has 10,000 shares of stock
that was purchased at a price that was 50 percent of the current level.
This trader owns stock that has doubled in value. After reviewing the
technical indicators on a chart, it appears that the stock is highly
extended from its moving average support line. However, the stock
is still showing strength as each day’ s close is higher than the previ-
ous day ’s close. If this trader truly believed that the price was going
to drop in the next trading session, it would be reasonable to expect
him to sell his entire position. Instead, the trader sells a portion of
his position and keeps the remainder open to take advantage of any
move higher in the stock price.
In this example, the trader is not necessarily expecting the
price to fall. Rather, he is managing risk by locking in some of his
profi ts. He started as a speculator by assuming risk in the market
and he is now lowering his risk by lowering his exposure to loss of
profi ts in the event the price should fall. It’ s important to make this
distinction because the reasons people buy and sell are more com-
plex than just watching two sides make a wild guess at the direction
of the next trade price. The swings between traders assuming risk
and traders transferring risk are at the heart of trends in the mar-
ket. Now multiply this single trade by many thousands or millions
of transactions and we see the trend wave forming. Note that we’ re
not advocating always looking for the reasons behind the trend in
technical analysis, but rather attempting to understand why trends
rise and fall.

Dow Theory
Charles Dow introduced his theory of the markets back in the early
1900s, but more than a hundred years passed before investors and
money managers alike realized how important technical analysis was
for managing risk in the marketplace. Charts are what we rely on to
help remove the emotions from the decision- making process, and
these are the tools The Market Guys use to trade the markets.
Whether you are a seasoned investor who has spent many years
taking risk in the market or one who is just starting out on a jour-
ney into the world of trading, you should make it a point to review
Mr. Dow’ s ideas as often as possible. We do our best to discuss the
tenets of Dow Theory whenever we can. Although there are many
who argue the relevance of Dow Theory, we believe that following
the trends will give you the highest probability of making money
in the markets. In every seminar we give, you can count on the fact
that we will be looking at charts. Trend analysis is the basis of how
we pick stocks, and analyzing these trends helps us establish our risk
points. There is a lot of truth to the old saying, “ Repetition is the best
teacher. ” If you apply these simple concepts to every chart you look
at, you will eventually become a master technician yourself.
Charles Dow made a simple observation that eventually pro-
pelled him to be one of the greatest analysts of all time. He recog-
nized that there were certain companies in the United States that
were the driving forces behind the U.S. economy. He believed that if
he measured the progress of the companies that were responsible
for stimulating the overall growth, he would have a leading indica-
tor for investors. So, on July 3, 1884, the Dow Jones Company, which
published the W all Street Journal , introduced 12 companies and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average was born. Twelve years later, the edi-
tors got together and added more stocks to the index in order to get
better insight into the driving forces of the economy at the time. The
index is reassessed every few years to ensure that the average refl ects
the blue - chip sector of the market. Following is a list of the original
Dow stocks that made up the Industrial Average in July 1884.

You can see by looking at these companies what the nature of
the economy was at the time, and although today’ s index looks a lot
different, you will still see in it the “ blue chips” that are the driving
our present - day economy.
Today the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price -
weighted average of 30 stocks traded on the New York Stock
Exchange (NY SE) and the Nasdaq. Often referred to as “ the Dow, ”
the DJIA is the oldest and single most watched index in the world.
Many times, you will hear fi nancial commentators say “ the market”
is up today, or “ the market ’ is down, and most of the time they are
referring to the Dow. The Dow is so popular that many investors
believe this index represents the whole of the U.S. markets. This, of
course, is not true, but it is amazing to see how many other markets
around the world react to the Dow when it is the highlight of the

In 1916 the number of stocks making up the Dow increased
to 20, and in 1928 the number increased once again to a total of
30 stocks. General Electric is the only original member left in the
index, although it was dropped a couple of times, then reinstated
between 1898 and 1907. The Dow is the oldest continuing U.S. index
and remains with us as a constant reminder of the man who brought
us technical analysis, Charles Dow.
One of the tenets discussed in Dow Theory is that the markets
have three trends: up, down, and sideways. We fi nd this to be the
most important of the six tenets because it helps us position our
money in the direction of the money fl ow. In other words, if you
want to make money in the market, then make sure you are putting
your money where the money is going. Going with the money fl ow
means we should be buying in the direction of the trend.

This shouldn’ t be too hard to understand, yet you would be
surprised to see just how many people buy stocks that are in down-
trends. People all over the world try to buy stocks that are at bottom
prices because we are all programmed, from a very young age, to
think that buying anything at a lower price is good. If you have ever
gone shopping at a department store, you may have noticed that
shoppers everywhere are attracted to the word s ale . Many who have
bought a new car tell us that they ’ ve spent long hours learning how
to negotiate a good price before they’ ve even entered the car dealer-
ship. If you have ever bought a new car for yourself, you know exactly
what we are talking about here. If you are planning to purchase a
car, this usually means you are going to experience sales pressure,
and if you are not a good negotiator, you will most likely pay a higher
price for that automobile than a buyer who is prepared and knows
how to deal with the salesperson. Either way, we know that we are
going to try to talk the salesperson down on the price, and when
we fi nally do manage to negotiate a price that feels good, we think
we ’ ve gotten a bargain. As a result of these behavior patterns, we are
conditioned to buy low.
After many years of this conditioning, we assume that this is the
way we should shop for stocks. But when we apply these same buy-
ing strategies to the stock market, we lose money and wonder why.
Changing a thought process like this is a lot like trying to break a
bad habit. It’ s not as easy as it sounds, and although buying stocks
that are trading at 52- week lows sounds like a good idea, it is not.
The better idea is to buy stocks that are on 52- week highs. It almost
seems unnatural to prefer paying a higher price for anything, yet
we must convince ourselves to think this way when we are trad-
ing because we are not shopping— we are trading for profi t. If you
want to make money in the market, you will have to understand
that growth companies and growth stocks are most likely going
to set new highs each and every week. So buying a stock like this
shouldn ’t be too scary, especially if you know there is a good chance
that it will go higher. Another way to look at this is to realize that
stocks on their 52 - week lows will most likely reach another new low,
so buying a stock in this condition will most likely cost you money.
Let ’s face it, is your buy order really going to change the minds of
all those people who have been selling this stock throughout the
year? Instead of trying to buy low and sell high, which is what most
people think of as a good plan, go ahead and tell yourself that you

are going to buy high to sell higher. Thinking this way will put you
on the right side of the trend.
Uptrends
In order to understand what it means to position yourself ahead
of the money fl ow, we need to look at what defi nes the three types of
trends. Let ’s start with the uptrend . Charles Dow defi ned an uptrend
as a time when successive rallies in a security price close at levels
higher than those achieved in previous rallies and when lows occur
at levels higher than previous lows. When you see a chart that looks
like Figure 3 .1 , it should be obvious to you that the buyers are con-
trolling price. The story of an uptrend tells us that the buyers are
willing to support the stock at higher levels while at the same time
the sellers are moving their sell limits higher in order to get the best
sale price. If you had a crowd of people rushing over to buy stock
from you, wouldn’ t you want to raise your sale price to get the high-
est possible profi t? Of course you would. Our strategy on the buy
side is to position ourselves alongside the other buyers who are busy
pushing the stock up. Recognizing an uptrend allows us to put our
money in the direction of the money fl ow. If your strategy is to fi nd
stocks that are in upward trends, then try looking at companies that
are trading on their 52 - week highs.

Another way is to scan headlines for companies that are in the
news, and if the trend is going up with a nice steady slope, you can
add them to your watch list. We prefer you qualify a stock for
your watch list by looking at the moving averages. As you can see in
Figure 3 .1 , this stock ’s 50- day s imple moving average (SMA) is above
the 200 - day simple moving average. When the moving averages are
running up and parallel to one another, we know that the stock has
been in an uptrend for some time. This is just one easy way to sort
for stocks that are being bought up by the buyers. We have had great
success in using this method, which is why we will be expanding on
the use of moving averages throughout this book.
In the real world, not all stocks are going to look like the one
in our example. Some will have uptrends that are more extreme,
meaning the price action will be more vertical, while other stocks
may show a more erratic footprint that might refl ect a more volatile
price history. This, of course, would make it harder for us to identify
the actual trend of the stock. Although using the 50- and 200- day
moving averages makes it easier for us to identify the overall trend,
it is important for you to know how to draw a trend line. As we men-
tioned earlier in the defi nition of an upward trend, lows occur at
levels higher than previous lows, which means it’ s the buyers who are
more motivated to push the stock higher. This also means that the
sellers are less willing to push the stock lower; therefore, it only makes
sense that we monitor the behavior pattern of the buyers when look-
ing at stocks that are trending higher. If the buyers decide to give up
on the stock, we will see this in the price action because these lows,
also known as t roughs , will no longer be successively higher. If we
notice that the lows or troughs are moving successively lower, then
that would be our signal to get out of the stock.
When constructing a trend line in a stock that is going up, we
would measure the lows because we want to keep our eyes on the
buyers. In Figure 3 .2 , points A, B, and C are lows that are successively
higher. This tells us that during the time these points were estab-
lished, the buyers were willing to pay higher prices. The aggressive
action of the buyers causes the sellers to back off to higher levels and
the footprint is seen with higher highs following the higher lows.
Drawing the trend line begins with your connecting the dots. Before
you do this, you would scan the price chart to see if there are any
other low points that fall in line with the ones you have already iden-
tifi ed as established lows (see Figure 3.3 ).

In Figure 3 .4 you will see that we have connected points A, B, and
C while extending the line further to the right. Notice how successive
lows reach the trend line and then will occasionally dip below. Drawing
a trend line takes minimal artistic talent, but it’ s important to know that
you don ’t have to get the points to match up exactly in a row. There
may be points on the chart where the price will dip slightly below your
line or rise before touching the line. Just remember that you are using
your trend line to gauge the intensity of the buying activity.

Figure 3.4 Lows May Vary around the Uptrend Line
Looking at the Angle of the Trend Line
Measuring the angle of the trend line will also help you develop a
feel for the market or stock you are trading. If you see a stock that
has been gradually going up in price over time with a nice steady
30 - to 40 - degree slope in the trend line, chances are the trend will
continue. This means we would stay in a long position for as long as
this trend continues in an upward direction. However, if we see prices
start to drop and stay below the trend line, this would be our signal
to get out of the stock entirely, defend our profi ts, or, more impor-
tantly, protect our account from a potential loss. Just understand
that it is the buyers who are controlling the price in an uptrend, and
focusing on the price will help us control the emotional side of the
trading plan, as we discussed in Chapter 2 .
Buying pressure can also be measured by the steepness of the
trend, relative to recent trend angles. Assume you’ re looking at a
stock with an uptrend angle of 20 degrees. If the slope of the trend
line begins to accelerate to 50 to 70 degrees or more, this means the
buyers are becoming more aggressive. When you see this happen,
make sure you are ready to exit the position as the chances of a pull-
back in price becomes greater as the angle of the slope increases. It
should make sense to you that, although we see vertical price moves
in stocks from time to time, vertical price moves do not last forever.
Of course, understand that the angle of the trend is a function of the

scale that you ’ re using on your chart. Therefore, the angles that we
discuss are relative to each other, not absolute.
Another way to think about this is to remember that the steeper
the trend, the less reliable the trend line becomes. Figure 3.5 shows
an example of a stock that started out with a nice steady trend, but
over time the angle of the trend line increases. Adjusting our trend
lines to account for the increase in angle is called fanning the lines.
Trend line A is where we connected a series of low points, giving us
a nice steady slope. There is nothing out of the ordinary here, but if
you look at the angle of trend line B, you will see that the increase in
slope tells us the buying pressure is increasing. This is a signal that
the buyers are getting more aggressive. As time passes, we can once
again see the angle of the trend continuing to increase. If you were in
this stock and found your trend line looking like the one at point D,
it would be time to take action. Your call to action would require sell-
ing out of all or at least some of the position. If you are unsure of the
exit point, then another good idea would be to place a sell stop order
just below the trend line at point D. Let the buyers tell you when
it ’s time to get out. If they ease up on the buying pressure, then the
stock will naturally pull back in price and your stop order will trigger
automatically. This will move you to cash, and once again you’ ll have
enough buying power in your account for the next trade.

Volume Confirms the Trend
One of the other important tenets of Dow Theory has to do with
volume analysis, and it states that trends are confi rmed by volume.
What this means is that if you see the trading volume of a stock increas-
ing in the direction of the trend, you have supporting evidence that
the trend is a strong one (see Figure 3 .6 ). If you see a stock going up
in price but notice that the volume is steadily decreasing, this would
tell us that we wouldn ’t want to rely on that trend as much.
Imagine you are fl ying a kite. The kite represents the stock price,
while the daily trading volume represents the wind needed to get
the kite to fl y. Hopefully, you have happy childhood memories that
will help you picture this in your mind. If not, then by all means go
out there and fl y a kite. It is a great stress reliever, and if you have
any friends or family members that you can invite, bring them along,
pack a nice picnic basket, and make a day out of it. It will be fun.
Flying this kite will absolutely help you learn how to read volume
on a price chart. In order for your kite to fl y, you will need wind
under it. The stronger the wind, the faster the kite will climb.

The same applies for the stocks you will be trading. For a stock
to sustain an upward trend, you need volume under it (the stronger
the volume, the steeper the trend). But what would happen to your
kite if all of a sudden the wind started to die down? If you have had
this happen to you as a child you might remember having to run a
little bit in order to create your own wind, right? If you didn’ t run,
the kite would start to fl ounder in the sky and you knew that if the
wind didn ’t pick up soon, the kite would fall.
You will see the same thing happen to the price of a stock. If
the volume starts to drop and you see that your stock is starting to
fl ounder in price, then there is a good chance your stock is going to
drop. If you see a steep trend line and you notice that the volume is
dramatically falling off, then you will often see the stock price break
the trend line or fall below an established support level and you
are now in a freefall. This is why we are so focused on encouraging
you to use trailing stops. You don’ t have to look at your stocks every
minute of every day; just make it a point to keep tabs on the price,
and if you see these signs, then you know it’ s time to take action. The
worst thing you could do is just sit there and hope that the stock is
going to go higher. If you feel that something is changing but you’ re
not quite sure if you see a clear signal, then your fi rst move should
always be to protect the position. You can never go wrong by being
defensive. We are usually caught off guard when we are in our most
relaxed position.
Downtrends
Downtrends are price patterns that show a negative slope. The highs
are getting lower and the lows are also moving successively lower.
Downtrend lines are drawn from high to high because we want to
track the path of the sellers who are, during this time, controlling
the price. You can also think of a downtrend line as a signal that tells
us supply is greater than the demand. It is not a good idea to be a
buyer while the downtrend is in force, yet there are many people
who take this advice lightly. If this is the only thing you get out of this
chapter, then the price you paid for this book will pay for itself over
and over again.
To construct a downtrend line, scan the chart with your eyes to see
if you can pick out any noticeable highs or peaks in the price action.

We did this for you in Figure 3.7 where you can see our high points
at A, B, and C. From there, it’ s just a matter of you connecting the
dots. In Figure 3 .8 you can see how we have drawn our line through
the tops. You do not have to be precise when connecting these points,
so don ’t worry about being exactly on the mark. Many times, you will
cross through some of the peaks, but the main goal is to identify a
general area where the sellers have displayed a history of selling.
This selling action eventually pushes the price to lower lows, and the
downtrend is identifi ed. You will also see that downtrend lines act as
resistance. In Figure 3 .8 lower lows follow lower highs because the

buyers continue to fade the market and move to the sidelines. Any
move over this downtrend line confi rmed by an increase in volume
tells us that demand is increasing; therefore, a change in trend could
be coming.
Sideways Trend
The third type of trend is one of our favorites. The sideways trend
frustrates most investors, but it ’s a price trend that many traders,
especially option traders, look for. Simply put, it is a period of time
on a chart where prices lay fl at or move within a well- defi ned trading
range. Also known as a consolidation pattern or price channel, buy-
ers and sellers reach a stalemate where each side establishes bounda-
ries that represent support and resistance.
Another way to look at a sideways trend is to think of it as a time
when supply and demand are in balance. Figure 3 .9 is an example
of a sideways trend where the stock is basically stuck in a price range.
As mentioned before, option traders favor such price ranges because
there are many different trading strategies they can initiate within this
channel. They can profi t from such trades because there are clear lines
of support and resistance, which allows them to manage their risk.
Support and Resistance
We’ ve covered the ideas behind building a trend line and how
important it is to gauge the motivation level of the buyers and sell-
ers. In doing so, we’ ve referred to the support and resistance. Let ’s

64 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
develop those concepts a little more. S upport is the level at which
demand for the stock is strong enough to keep the stock from drop-
ping any f urther. Support levels are usually identifi ed somewhere
below where the stock is actually trading, and although it is not an
exact price point, we look at support as a general area. You could
also think of support as a fl oor where the buyers are more motivated
than the sellers. Understand that technical analysis is not an exact
science, so many times the support level may not seem clear to you.
However, practice will hone your skills, and over time your eye will
easily be able to pick out support levels.
On the other side is r esistance . Resistance is the price level at
which the selling pressure is strong enough to prevent the stock
from rising further. You can think of this as a ceiling where the sell-
ers have convinced the buyers that they are outnumbered and the
buyers move to the sidelines. Like support, this is not an exact price
level. It’ s best to think of resistance as a price area where supply
in the stock has overcome the demand. These resistance areas are
found above where the stock is currently trading, and every buyer
should be aware of the price points where overhead supply exists. It’ s
good practice to know where the sellers are stacking up before you
ever consider taking a long position.
Looking back at Figure 3 .9 you see an example of a stock that
has been trading in a horizontal price channel. Notice the support
level, which connects the lows of the channel. Remember, we are
looking for general areas where there has been a history of buying
activity. We know that this is an area of demand because the buyers
were able to rally the stock from these points. Should the price drop
and stay below the lows, this would tell us that the buyers are losing
their ability to hold up the stock and the sellers are taking charge of
the price action.
The resistance line is drawn horizontally by connecting the
channel highs. If there were any highs that crossed slightly over this
line, it would be okay because once again we are looking for general
areas as opposed to exact price points. Should we see a strong move
over resistance on high volume, this would be called a breakout .
Breakouts are footprints that tell us the buyers are getting aggres-
sive. When the sellers see this aggression, they will “ fade the market ”
by raising their sell prices in an effort to see how far the buyers will
chase the market.

Moving Averages
We would be missing a big piece of the trend story if we didn ’t discuss
moving averages. We ’ ll discuss the details of constructing and using the
moving average more in the next chapter. For now, recognize that
they are one of the most valuable tools we have when it comes to
identifying and analyzing price trends. Many times, you will fi nd that
the trend lines you draw will run parallel or even on top of one of the
major moving averages.
You may have heard it said that a moving average is a lazy man ’s
trend line. With that said, let us point out that we are always in favor
of simplifying the process, so think of this as our way of helping you
keep things super simple. The other point to consider is that you are
not the only person in the world using moving averages to identify
trends in the market. Therefore, when a stock is breaking below a
major moving average, the general trading population is put on alert.
Once the traders are in defense mode, you will see a drop in the buy-
ing pressure. From there, the natural progression is an increase in
supply and the sell off begins. The fact that many millions of inves-
tors and traders use moving averages as a signal to get in or out of
a stock tells us that we cannot ignore the power these simple lines
have with regard to affecting the price action of a stock or index.
In Figure 3.10 you will see how closely the 50 - day moving average

correlates to the intermediate trend line. Notice how the stock shows
a pattern of price rallies near these support levels. Many people fol-
low moving averages, so it’ s not unusual to see the major moving
averages act as support for the stock.
Unfortunately, not enough investors have realized the value in
using moving averages. Most charts include a basic selection of mov-
ing averages. Not only will they help you determine the trend of the
market, but they also serve as tools to manage risk. Learning how to
minimize loss when you pick the wrong stock is critical to your suc-
cess. If you have never used moving averages before, then we strongly
recommend you start using them now. After a while, you may elimi-
nate the need to draw trend lines altogether. Your trained eye will
eventually be able to see the trend in a fl ash. This not only saves you
time in selecting a good stock, but it also removes any doubt when it
comes time to exit a stock or option position.
Back on Track
After reading this chapter, you may have recognized that you have
been fi ghting the trend. You try to buy the next low because you just
know that the rally is coming. Or you short the stock that is pushing
new heights because there is no good reason for the price to be at
such high levels. Our hope is that you will get back on the track of
following the money trail. Maybe the company isn’ t worthy of the
lofty stock price it happens to possess, but you need to understand
that your short sale won ’t bring the market back in balance. Put your
money where the money is fl owing. If the money is fl owing into a
stock, go ahead and buy it. When the money is fl owing out of a stock,
join the sellers. Your profi ts and sanity will both reap the rewards of
moving with the market rather than against it.

Several years after purchasing my fi rst new home, I decided to fi nish
the basement. The space was a walk-out basement (now cleverly
described as “terrace-level” by creative real estate marketers) with
three sides that were poured concrete walls. Since my construction
expertise falls at the lower end of the skill spectrum, I consulted several
friends about the best way to fi nish the walls. They told me that the
simplest approach would be to install furring strips along the entire
length of the poured walls. Furring strips are nothing more than slats of
treated lumber that run perpendicular to the fl oor. The drywall panels

could then be attached to the furring strips and the wall fi nished the
same as a typical framed wall.
The challenge was fi guring out the best way to attach the furring
strips to the concrete wall. The two most common methods are drilling
into the wall and installing masonry screws or using a powder-actuated
nail gun to drive the nails into the wall. For those of you who aren’t
familiar with a powder-actuated nail gun, I can explain it very easily.
The tool looks like a small weapon. One end is loaded with a powder
cartridge, quite similar to a rifl e shell. The other end is loaded with
a nail wrapped in a rubber seat. In order to set the nail, you simply
place the nail tip against the wall and pull the trigger. The powder in
the cartridge explodes, fi ring the nail into the wall with a single shot.
Now let’s review the options. First, I could do a lot of work manhan-
dling a drill against a solid wall followed by more work setting the
screw. Or I could fi re a gun at the wall. In my book, this was a classic
no-brainer.
So I went to my local home improvement store and purchased
a nail gun with plenty of cartridges and nails. I dutifully loaded the
gun per the instructions and carefully set the nail tip against the wall.
Taking care to ensure that everything was in order, I pulled the trigger.
There was a loud crack, a bit of recoil, and a puff of smoke where the
nail was fi rmly set through the furring strip into the wall. It would be an
understatement to say that the nail gun became my favorite tool that
day. Furring strips only require several anchors to attach them to a
wall but I had an excuse to set a dozen nails into each strip. Eventually,
I ran out of furring strips. There I was with a perfectly good nail gun and
nothing to nail! Now I was trying to fi gure out alternative uses for this
tool. Sure, a handsaw was specifi cally designed for cutting lengths of
board but a properly aligned nail gun just might be able to accom-
plish the task with a single shot.
Many traders fi nd themselves armed with the equivalent of a
powder - actuated nail gun when they approach the market. It’ s been
said that if the only tool you know how to use is a hammer, every-
thing starts to look an awful lot like a nail. An interesting twist to this
phenomenon is that it becomes more frequent with the more arcane
technical indicators. A trader who uses a simple moving a verage, for

example, generally has no problem with using the indicator when
appropriate and disregarding it when not appropriate. However,
we ’ ve met more than just a few traders who, upon learning about
Fibonacci retracement levels, wouldn ’t dream of entering the mar-
kets if you took away their Fibonacci lines. Why is this? Perhaps it’ s
an extension of the nail gun story. The trader fi nds a tool that not
only looks good but is also a lot of fun to apply. Eventually, they con-
vince themselves that they have their hands on the best tool in the
toolbox.
The difference between fi nishing out a basement and the market
is this: If you try to use your nail gun to cut lengths of board in the
basement project, your folly will be readily apparent. If you attempt
to apply Fibonacci lines to every chart you read, the charts will let
you. In fact, the chart data will be more than suffi cient to allow you
to “ see ” the pattern in just about every application, thereby reinforc-
ing your belief that you’ re using the best tool. When the trade moves
against you and you start to lose money, there are a multitude of
other factors to which you can attribute the loss. Then when the next
trade opportunity arises, out comes the nail gun.
This chapter is designed to give you a solid understanding of
some of the more common tools that you have at your disposal,
including their strengths and limitations. Each technical indicator
that we cover will follow this format:

Remember that the goal is to keep everything simple. Calcula-
tions are included to enhance your understanding of how the indi-
cator is derived, but if you want to skip past them, you won’ t lose
anything in your ability to learn the application. One more point
to note is that the charts shown are black and white. Therefore,
when we refer to candlesticks on the charts, a white candlestick
is an up day where the closing price is higher than the opening
price. A black candle is a down day where the closing price is lower
than the opening price. Most charting programs allow for color
charting, and green is up while red is down. In our discussions,

Trend Lines
Overview
Trend lines are not much more than the adult version of connect -
the - dots. We introduced these handy tools in the previous chapter.
They are used to create a smooth picture of the prevailing direction
of the stock price movement. Of course, as the name suggests, trend
lines are drawn when we identify a trend, either an uptrend or a
downtrend. The simplest defi nition of an uptrend is higher highs
and higher lows. Along with that, a downtrend is identifi ed as lower
highs and lower lows. Both parts of the defi nition must hold for the
trend to be in effect. For example, if a stock is making higher highs
and lower lows, it is not an uptrend. The picture that is created from
higher highs and lower lows is an expanding fan resulting from the
widening range over where the stock is trading.
Another important consideration of the trend line is that it may
change frequently. As we learned from Dow Theory, prices tend to
exhibit different trends over various time horizons. When we switch
our view from intraday charting to weekly charting, we may see
different trends in effect. Over the previous few hours, we see the
prices trending down, but they suddenly stop and begin to rise into
an uptrend. A short- term downtrend may be halted by a longer- term
uptrend. Along with this, the shorter - term trends will, by defi nition,
fl uctuate between uptrends and downtrends. That ’s what makes them
short term.
Calculation
One of the nice features of the trend line is that there is no calcula-
tion per se. As such, it is appealing because it is so easily understood
by even a beginner. The trend line is drawn as a best- fi t line based on
a subjective review of the chart. By defi nition, a line is defi ned by any
two points. Therefore, we can initially create a trend line by iden-
tifying two price points on the chart and connecting them with a
straight line.
For an uptrend, we want to connect the lows of the trend. As
we mentioned in the overview, the uptrend will exhibit higher lows
along the trend. The trader needs to fi nd these lows and draw a line
cc0044..iinndddd 7700 1111//22//0077 1122::1177::4422 PPMM

that best crosses through these lows. A downtrend is marked by lower
highs, and it is this level that defi nes the downtrend line. Therefore,
we want to draw a straight line that best captures the falling highs
along the downtrend.
The question often arises as to which price point to use in con-
necting the higher lows in an uptrend. Should you connect the low-
est low for the day? What about the closing price of the day? Some
traders suggest that you use the bottom of the candlestick body,
regardless of whether that happens to be the open or the close. In
practice, you may actually incorporate multiple price points as you
view the trend and decide where to strike the trend line. Dr. Richard
M. Wyskida, associate dean of the College of Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Alabama in Huntsville, often advised his students to plot a
data set and then step back and “ let the data talk to you. ” The point
he was making is that it is helpful to get a picture of the data before
rushing into various analyses. The fact is, our eye will usually see pic-
tures and patterns emerge from the price chart before the technical
indicators reveal them quantitatively. So how does this help us with
drawing a trend line? As we look at the chart, we will see the pattern
of cycles along the trend. We ’ ll identify the price swinging to new
highs, stalling and dropping to the next higher low. The low will
reverse and the stock will rally to the next higher high. Sometimes,
the reversal points will fi t nicely to the candlestick bodies; sometimes it
will fi t better to the shadows (highs and lows). This is illustrated in
Figure 4.1 . Notice at point A that the three points that the trend line

crosses are all the lows for the trading days. The candlestick bodies
of the fi rst two days are much higher than the trend line itself. At
point B, the fi rst day ’s low penetrates below the trend line, the sec-
ond day is slightly above and the third day rests quite close to the line.
At point C, the fi rst day ’s low is on the trend line while the second
day ’s candlestick body sits on the trend line with the low dropping
below. If we were to set rigid rules regarding which price point to
use, you can see how this would create trouble for us. However, a
glance at the chart shows that we’ ve drawn a trend line that captures
the higher lows quite well because we ’ ve given ourselves a little fl ex-
ibility in where the line is placed.
Application
The trend line will help us defi ne support in an uptrend and resist-
ance in a downtrend. Since we ’ re connecting the higher lows in an
uptrend, we expect that the price will trade above the trend line. As
the price rises, each pullback will drop down to the trend line. We con-
sider that to be normal and expected movement as long as the trend
holds. Support, by defi nition, is the price level at which the buying
pressure overcomes the selling pressure and the stock begins to move
higher. Since we’ ve created the trend line based on just this activity
occurring, our expectation is that it will continue. If the stock price
should drop signifi cantly below our trend line, then it has moved
into an area that is not normal and expected in the uptrend. Notice
that we say “ signifi cantly ” because as we saw in Figure 4 .1 , occasional
and minor drops below the trend line are not unusual. They are the
result of the subjective placement of the trend line itself.
We already mentioned that a line is defi ned by two points but it
becomes more robust as we add more points. Figure 4 .1 shows three
distinct reversals where the lows are successively higher at points A, B
and C. Once the trend line is established, it becomes the basis for enter-
ing a trade as well as exiting a trade. Since we expect the price to rise off
of support as long as the trend holds, we look for buying opportunities
shortly after the stock hits the trend line and begins to move back up.
We then protect ourselves by placing a sell stop order below the trend
line. Based on our expectation, if the stock should drop below the sup-
port indicated by the trend line, we assume that the trade is moving
against us and we exit the position. As you can see, the trend line got us
into the trade and will tell us when it ’s time to move on.

Example
Look at Figure 4 .2 and see if you can quickly identify the higher lows
that defi ne the trend line. Of course, we’ ve already drawn the line
for you, but you should still observe the upswings that were used
to place the line. The fi rst low is at the extreme lower left side of
the chart. The second point, which initially defi nes the line, is at the
center of the chart. Point A is the third point and confi rms the trend
line that was established by the fi rst two points.
In our example in Figure 4.2 , we could enter a long trade at
point A based on the fact that we have already established the trend
line, and now we see the stock moving up and away from the line.
Notice that immediately before the very long up day, the stock price
dipped slightly. It even penetrated the trend line before closing back
above the line. This is why we place the stop order below the trend
line. It allows for minor intraday dips without stopping the position
prematurely.
Let ’s look at what happened at point B. The stock price dropped
hard to the trend line, as evidenced by the long black candle. On
that day the sellers were clearly in control. That’ s the very reason
why we wouldn’ t buy the stock on that day, even though the trend
line still appeared to be holding as support. We want to buy when
the buyers are buying, not when the sellers are selling. The next day
would have been the day we would have expected to enter the trade,
but instead of holding support, the price dropped hard below the

trend line support. Once that trend line support was broken, the
sellers established control and moved the stock progressively lower
from that point.
Any trader with a long position would likely have exited the week
or two before point B based on a trailing stop after the quick rally or
perhaps the warning signs given by the side - by - side long black can-
dles. However, if you were still holding on to a long position after
point B, the fi rst drop where the stock closed below the trend line
support would have been the must- exit point. Sure, you would have
allowed the stock to drop quite a bit from the high, but holding and
hoping would clearly have compounded the loss.
Channel Lines
Overview
Many times, we observe prices bouncing between cyclical highs and
lows, where the peaks seem to be running parallel to the valleys. The
price may be slightly trending or simply running sideways, but
the highs can be connected by a line, and the lows can be connected
by another, parallel line. When this occurs, we consider the price to
be channeling, and the lines we draw are the channel lines.
Channeling goes by various names, including oscillating, chan-
neling, sideways, and consolidating. If the channel occurs without
an underlying trend— that is, the price moves sideways without a
change in the highs or lows— many traders will look for a breakout
from the channel before taking on a new position. Channels often
continue for long stretches, which confi rms the channel lines with
multiple points. These long channels allow us to clearly see the sup-
port and resistance, which makes it easier to identify the level at
which we would exit the trade.
Calculation
As with the trend line, once again there is no calculation in drawing
the channel lines. What we look for is a best- fi t line that connects the
highs of the channel range. A second best- fi t line is then drawn,
which connects the lows. The upper and lower channel lines should
run approximately parallel to each other. Look at the upper chan-
nel line in Figure 4.3 . Notice how the high of the fi rst candle almost
touches the line, while the highs of the second cycle are a bit lower.
Several points actually penetrate above the line during the day but

close at or below the line. The same picture can be seen along the
lower channel line. Some points are above, some dip slightly below,
and others are right at the line. This is what we mean by a best - fi t
line. It is the rare chart that will let you draw a line with all points
sitting squarely along the line with no variations.
In Figure 4.4 the price is channeling but with an upward
trend. The upper and lower channel lines are drawn with a best-
fit line and run parallel to each other. However, both channel
lines run upward at the same angle. Notice that if we omit the

76 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
upper channel line, we are left with simply an uptrend support
line since we ’ re connecting the higher lows.
Application
Channeling stocks may be traded either within the channel to cap-
ture short- term moves along the cycles or as breakouts when the
price fi nally penetrates one of the channel lines. If you choose to
trade within the channel, you want to ensure that the channel is
wide enough to allow for a reasonable profi t from the trade. Some
prices move within a well - defi ned channel but with so little distance
between the highs and lows as to make it hardly worth the effort.
When trading within the channel, the goal is to buy as close to
the lower channel line support as possible. Keep in mind that you
still need to buy with the buyers, which means that a long trade
should only be entered following a green (or white) candle. The
target for a long trade is the upper channel line resistance. It takes
some practice to recognize when the trade may not reach the tar-
get and profi ts need to be taken early. As we saw from drawing the
lines, sometimes the cycles don’ t reach the channel lines, so you
shouldn ’t tenaciously hold a position until it absolutely reaches the
target line. For a long trade that was entered at the lower channel
support line, the sell stop order should be placed slightly below the
lower channel line. If the channel fails and the price drops, you
want to exit the trade.
Channels with a downward trend may be traded in the same way,
except you ’ ll be looking for short trade opportunities. Always trade a
trending channel in the direction of the overall trend. If the channel
has a downward trend, the best trade is when you can enter a short
position close to the upper channel resistance. Again, remember to
wait until the sellers are in control, as evidenced by a red (or black)
candle as the price drops off the resistance. A short trade would be
protected with a market buy stop placed slightly above the upper
channel resistance line.
A channel breakout is the alternative approach to trading chan-
nels and is the favorite of many traders. With a channel breakout,
we ’ re not going to predict which way the price will break out; we
just want to pounce on the opportunity when it arises. A channel
breakout to the top occurs when the price reaches the upper chan-
nel resistance line and rallies to close decisively above the line. This
trade is especially signifi cant when the volume rises on the breakout

day. A breakout with very low volume relative to recent volume has
to be approached with caution. That’ s not to say you can’ t trade a
breakout with low volume but it is not the preferred setup.
Sometimes the price within the channel will give early warning
signs that a breakout may be imminent. For example, if the price rises
up toward the upper channel line and then hovers at the line instead
of falling back into the channel, the buyers are not backing down in
the face of expected selling. Don ’t buy yet, but be on the lookout
for the buyers making the next push, which would result in a breakout.
There are two entry points for a breakout. The fi rst is to buy the
stock on the initial breakout. If the breakout is strong, however, you
may not be able to buy close to the upper channel line. Alternatively,
you could wait for the stock to pull back to the upper channel line
and retest it as a support level. When this happens, enter the long
trade on the pullback following a green candle. The only danger
with waiting for a pullback to the upper channel line following a
breakout is that it may not happen. Some breakouts are so strong
that the breakout is followed by a rally that never again reaches the
upper channel line.
Example
Point A in Figure 4 .4 is an example of where to enter a long trade
within an upward trending channel. Notice that although point A is
the third day that the price was at the lower channel line support, it
was the fi rst day with a green candle. The green candle was not so
long that you would be entering the trade well into the channel. It
is close enough to the lower channel support line that we still have
plenty of room within the channel from which to profi t. The follow-
ing day was a sharp rally, and it was followed by fi ve days of sideways
trading. Since the price wasn ’t making new highs, the trade should
be closed even though it had not quite reached the upper channel
line. In this case, close was good enough!
Figure 4.5 shows us a channel breakout with both options for
entering a long trade. Notice that the price hovered close to the
upper channel line for about a week before it fi nally broke above. At
point A, you would have been able to enter a long trade on the initial
breakout. While the volume associated with the breakout wasn’ t as
strong as the ideal, it wasn ’t weak, so the trade could be taken. Upon
entering the trade at point A, you would place your sell stop slightly

below the upper channel resistance line. Once the breakout occurs,
we expect the upper channel line to become support.
As we can see at point B, we’ re given a second opportunity to
enter a long trade when the price falls back to test the support line.
If you had entered the long position at point A, you may have taken
a profi t with a trailing stop when the price started to fall. If not, you
would still be in the trade at point B, because the price didn’ t dip
below the support line. Either entry would have allowed you to profi t
from the subsequent rally that followed point B.
Moving Averages
Overview
Moving averages are perhaps the most commonly used technical
indicator for a variety of reasons. First, they are easily understood
by most traders. The concept of an average is one that is applied in
everyday life. We talk about average salary, average height, and aver-
age fuel economy in a new vehicle. The moving average updates the
average value each time a new data point appears on the chart. Sec-
ond, moving averages have always shown their utility as a support
level when the price is above the average and as a resistance level
when the price is trading below the average. Third, moving aver-
ages may be calculated over multiple periods, which gives the trader
great fl exibility in applying them as single indicators or combining
them together as multiple indicators.

==================================================

The Trader’s Toolbox 79
Calculation
We’ ll focus this discussion on the two most popular moving averages:
the simple moving average (SMA) and the exponential moving aver-
age (EMA). There are a number of other moving averages available,
including weighted moving average and linear displaced moving
average. We’ ve found through practice that the SMA and EMA cap-
ture the utility of moving averages very well.
The SMA is the arithmetic mean of the data set. The equation
for the SMA is as follows:
(cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:2). . .(cid:2)
SMA ( X1 X2 Xn)/n
Where
(cid:1)
Xi closing price of period i
(cid:1)
n number of data points
Therefore, the 20 - day SMA would have 20 data points consisting
of the closing price of the most recent 20 days. The 20 points are
totaled and divided by 20 to arrive at the average value. When a new
trading day is complete, the new closing price is added into the total
while the oldest is dropped. In this way, the average “ moves ” with the
progression of time.
The exponential moving average differs from the SMA in that
the data is weighted to give the most recent price more signifi cance
than the older price data. Since the most recent price is factored
more heavily in the calculation, it follows that the EMA signals price
changes more quickly than the SMA.
The equation for the exponential moving average is as follows:
1. T he exponential smoothing factor is calculated as
(cid:1) (cid:2)
ESF 2/(n 1)
(cid:1)
Where n number of data points
So for a 20 - day EMA, the ESF is 2/21 or 0.095.
2. N ext, the EMA is calculated as
(cid:1) (cid:3)
EMA (Today’s closing price ESF)
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4)
(Previous EMA value (1 ESF))

==================================================

80 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
We want to emphasize that the calculations are provided here for
your reference. Understanding the mathematics behind the indica-
tor is not required for your successful application to trading.
Application
SMA and EMA are most commonly used as support and resistance
levels that follow the action of the price. Trend lines and channel
lines, as we ’ ve discussed, are straight lines that must be manually
adjusted as the movement of the price changes. Moving averages,
however, follow the change in price movement because they are
calculated indicators rather than subjectively drawn. Therefore,
while various traders will interpret trend lines and channel lines
differently, an EMA or SMA will be exactly the same for different
traders who are examining the same chart.
As we mentioned in the calculation, EMAs will respond more
quickly to changes in the price movement. Therefore, the EMA
will follow the price more closely than the SMA, resulting in more
instances of price touching or crossing the moving average. While this
yields more buy and sell signals, it will also tend to yield more false
signals. That is, it may tell us to sell when we really shouldn’ t be sell-
ing. There is no right or wrong when it comes to deciding whether to
use the EMA or SMA; it is simply a question of how sensitive you want
your indicator to be when generating buy and sell signals.
Another question to answer besides which moving average to use
is how many periods to include in the moving average. Should you
use a 20 - day or 50 - day moving average? What about a 21 - day versus
a 20 - day? In general, we recommend three basic periods for traders
who are just starting to use moving averages. First, the 20- day mov-
ing average is a good short- term indicator since it approximates the
number of trading days in a month. You could refi ne the number to 21,
but we ’ ve observed in practice that 20 is more easily understood,
and the extra day doesn ’t buy a signifi cant improvement in perform-
ance. Second, the 50- day moving average is a good intermediate-
term indicator since it approaches the number of trading days in a
quarter. Once again, purists may gravitate toward the 63- day moving
average, but we believe the 50 - day is suffi cient for beginners. Finally, the
200 - day moving average is widely recognized as the best long- term
indicator. Many money managers, traders, and others follow the 200- day
moving average as a measure of the overall trend. We ’ ve seen cases

where a stock has rallied for a long time and fi nally breaks down
below short - term support. The fall is fast and furious, yet the price
will inexplicably stop as if it were a ball hitting a concrete fl oor. When
the 200- day SMA is overlaid onto the chart, the price stops almost
to the penny at the 200 -d ay moving average.
Another common application of the moving averages is to select
two different time periods and use both moving averages as crossover
indicators. A simple example would be to use the 20- day SMA and
the 50- day SMA. The 20 - day SMA is called the fast moving average,
and the 50- day SMA is the slow moving average. They are referred to
as fast and slow due to their speed in responding to changes in price.
If the 20 - day SMA is below the 50- day SMA and the stock is trading
below both, the stock is in a short - intermediate - term downtrend.
For a buying signal, we would look for the price to fi rst break above
the moving average resistance lines. Next, we would look for the
20 - day SMA to cross above the 50 - day SMA. This is referred to as a
bullish moving average crossover. At the point that the fast moving
average is above the slow moving average, we would enter a long
position and place our sell stop below the slow moving average. As the
price establishes the uptrend, we could tighten the stop by bringing
it up to just below the fast moving average.
A word of caution is in order when using moving averages.
Because the moving average is specifi cally intended to identify trends
and reversals, they become much less reliable when the price is mov-
ing sideways. Even if the price has a wide range, the moving average
will go fl at for a sideways stock. When this happens, there will be
numerous buy and sell signals, but they won’ t have much validity.
Be sure that the chart you’ re looking at has a trend in either direc-
tion before applying the moving average as a technical indicator. In
Figure 4 .6 , the stock has been in a sideways trading range and the
200 - day SMA fl attens out. While there are a couple of points where
the moving average appears to be holding as support or resistance,
there are many more where the price simply ignores the line and
bounces to either side.
Example

50 - day SMA for the latter part of 2006 and into January 2007. We can

below that support level. The fi rst part of February shows a decisive
break below the support, and the price remains below for the rest of
the chart. In this example, any long position would have been exited
based on a sell stop below the 50 - day SMA.
As the stock is trading above the 50 - day SMA level, there are sev-
eral points where the price dips to the moving average and starts
to rally. These would all be good entry points for a new long position

because the price is above support and the buyers are regaining
control as they push the price back up from the moving average.
Short- term profi ts would be recognized by using a trailing stop on
each of the minor cycles. Longer - term profi ts would require placing
your stop below the moving average and raising the stop price as the
moving average rises.
Figure 4.8 includes both the 20- day SMA (thin gray line) and the
50 - day SMA (bold black line). Notice how the 20 - day SMA is much
more volatile due to the fact that it is faster than the 50- day SMA.
In this chart, we observe the moving average crossover. At point A,
we can see where the price has started to trade above both moving
averages and the 20 - day SMA crosses above the 50 - day SMA. A long
trade would be entered at point A, based on the bullish crossover.
We would manage this trade by placing a sell stop below the 50- day
moving average if we ’ re looking to capture the intermediate- term
profi t. As an alternative, some traders will wait until they see a bear-
ish moving average crossover before exiting a trade that was entered
on a bullish crossover. Notice that the bearish crossover, where the
20 - day SMA drops back below the 50 - day SMA, occurs at point B.
This is just a few trading days past the drop below the 50 - day SMA
support. Either exit from the long position would have generated
a handsome profi t from the extended rally that followed the initial
moving average crossover.

Fibonacci Retracement Lines
Overview
Fibonacci retracement lines are perhaps the most elegant of the
technical indicators, if not the most reliable, because of their ori-
gin and ubiquity in nature. Named after the famous twelfth - century
mathematician, the Fibonacci retracement lines are based on the
Fibonacci number sequence. The sequence is as follows:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc.
Notice that each number is the sum of the previous two num-
bers. Every two successive numbers in the sequence approaches the
Golden Ratio when their quotient is calculated. As the sequence gets
higher, the ratio is more closely followed. The Golden Ratio is 1.618
and is observed as follows:
(cid:1)
3/2 1.5
(cid:1)
5/3 1.67
(cid:1)
8/5 1.6
(cid:1)
13/8 1.625
(cid:1)
21/13 1.615
(cid:1)
34/21 1.619
(cid:1)
55/34 1.618
(cid:1)
89/55 1.618
An interesting characteristic of the Golden Ratio is that its inverse
is equal to the Golden Ratio minus one. This is shown as
(cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:1)
( 1 / 1.618 ) ( 1.618 1 ) .618
Finally, as if all this weren ’t enough to entertain the puzzle
fanatic within us, the Fibonacci sequence is evident throughout all of
nature. The Golden Ratio has been observed in such diverse natural
phenomena as the spiral of a nautilus shell, the petals on a fl ower,
the formation of a pine cone, and the height of your belly button
(cid:3)
(your total height .618!).
Calculation
The standard Fibonacci retracement lines used in most trading
software packages are 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, 50 percent and
cc0044..iinndddd 8844 1111//22//0077 1122::1177::4455 PPMM



==================================================

The Trader’s Toolbox 85
61.8 percent. We see from the overview that 61.8 percent is derived
directly from the Golden Ratio of .618. 100 percent less 61.8 per-
cent yields 38.2 percent and 61.8 percent less 38.2 percent yields
23.6 percent. We see that 50 percent is not a standard number in the
Fibonacci sequence, but it is generally included because 50 percent
is considered a common retracement for stock prices.
Trading software packages will draw these common retracement
levels after you have identifi ed the low and high points along a trad-
ing range. For example, if a stock has moved from a low price of $ 20
to a high price of $ 30, you would select these two price extremes
and the software would draw the appropriate retracement levels at
$ 27.64, $ 26.18, $ 25.00, and $ 23.82.
Application
The objective of using Fibonacci retracement lines is to identify lev-
els of support when a stock pulls back following a rally or, alternately,
to identify levels of resistance when a stock rallies following a drop.
Care must be taken to not enter a trade based solely on the
Fibonacci retracement level. As with any support or resistance line,
whether drawn such as the trend line or calculated such as the moving
average, it is best to confi rm the level. An illustration of how you might
confi rm the level is with the example in the previous calculation para-
graph. Let’ s assume that over the last few weeks the stock has moved
from $ 20 to $ 30 and is now starting to pull back. You want to enter
a long position at some point in the pullback. What would you look
for as an entry opportunity? You watch as the stock drops to the fi rst
retracement level at $ 27.64, but you don ’t see any signs of the price
drop slowing. However, as the price approaches $ 26.18, you notice
two things occurring. First, the trading volume, which started strong,
has tapered off signifi cantly. Second, the price dipped to $ 26.00 for
a brief time during the day but has since closed above $ 26.18. Upon
examining the daily candlestick chart, you see that today’ s candle pat-
tern is a hammer reversal. In this instance, you have the Fibonacci
retracement level confi rmed by both volume and the chart pattern. If
the buyers start to step in tomorrow, you may enter a long trade and
protect yourself with a sell stop just below the $ 26.18 level.
Example

we see the low and high ends of the range identifi ed. Since we’ re

Figure 4.9 Fibonacci Retracement Levels in an Uptrend
starting with an uptrend, we ’ re interested in which price levels will
act as support based on the Fibonacci retracements. As we can see
at the far right side of the chart, the long black candle indicates a
sharp price drop on heavy volume. The following day showed that
the selling had halted, at least temporarily, and the volume was much
lighter than the initial sell - off. Notice how closely the price reached
to the fi rst support line at 38.2 percent. The lower shadow on the
long black candle came very close to this level, which was identifi ed
by the Fibonacci retracement of the overall trend range.
In this example, we would watch to see if the candle patterns
give us any more confi rmation of a pending reversal. Simply taking a
breather, as is the case here, is not suffi cient for a new long position.
However, if the price trades close to this support level over the coming
few days without falling below, we could buy into a new position and
place our sell stop slightly below the 38.2 percent retracement line.
Stochastic Oscillator
Overview
The stochastic oscillator, also referred to simply as the stochastic,
is an indicator that measures a stock’ s buying and selling strength
relative to its own past performance. By this, we mean that we ’ re
not comparing the stock to any market or sector benchmark to
determine when it may be time to buy or sell. The Stochastic is
cc0044..iinndddd 8866 1111//22//0077 1122::1177::4466 PPMM



==================================================

==================================================

The Trader’s Toolbox 87
generally comprised of two lines: the fast line (called %K) and the
slow line (called %D).
As we’ ll observe in the calculations, the stochastic indicator
ranges in value between 0 and 1 (or 0 to 100 percent). As a rule,
any value below about 25 percent is considered oversold. The think-
ing is that the stock is too weak relative to its own past performance
and, therefore, should correct with rising prices. Any value above
about 75 percent is considered overbought and should correct with
falling prices. As an oscillator, the stochastic tends to work better in
channels. When a stock moves into a strong uptrend, for example,
the stochastic will reach overbought levels without the price correct-
ing downward. Conversely, in a strong downtrend the stochastic will
reach the oversold levels without a correction upward.
Calculation
The fi rst stochastic line is called the fast line because it is calculated
directly from the price data. The indicator is based on the current
closing price as measured against the highest high and the lowest
low in the period over which the stochastic is calculated. The equa-
tion is as follows:
(cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:4)
%K (Today’s close Lowest low)/(Highest high Lowest low)
If we’ re using a period of 10 days, then we would identify the
highest trade price over the 10- day period and the lowest trade price
over the 10 - day period for our calculation.
The second stochastic line is referred to as the slow line since it
is smoothed through a moving average calculation. As we saw in the
section on moving averages, a moving average smooths the volatility
of the price data. With the slow stochastic, or %D, the volatility of
the %K is smoothed in the same manner. The equation for the slow
stochastic is as follows:
(cid:1)
%D N-period moving average of %K
where N is the number of periods over which the %K is smoothed.
%D often uses three periods as a common smoothing factor. As with
the moving average on price, the %D may use either a simple, expo-
nential, or weighted moving average calculation. The SMA and EMA
are the most common moving averages used in the %D calculation.

==================================================

88 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
Application
There are three primary ways in which the stochastic is used to iden-
tify trading opportunities. The fi rst is as a threshold indicator. As we
previously mentioned, the stochastic helps to identify when a stock is
overbought or oversold as compared to its own recent past perform-
ance. The overbought region is around 70 to 80 percent, while the
oversold region is around 20 to 30 percent. There isn’ t a right or
wrong threshold to use with the stochastic. Rather, you need to decide
how sensitive you want the indicator to be in generating signals. As
you widen the range, the number of signals will decrease. However,
the signals that are generated should be stronger. For example, if
you decide to use 10 percent and 90 percent as your thresholds, it
is apparent that the stochastic will hit these levels fewer times than
if you use 30 percent and 70 percent. As a threshold indicator, most
traders look for the stochastic to pass the threshold, and then they’ ll
enter a trade when the indicator crosses the threshold in the other
direction. Looking at Figure 4 .10 , we see at point A where the sto-
chastic initially crossed below the 20 percent line, telling us that the
stock was oversold. A few days later at point B, the stock crossed back
up above the 20 percent line. It is here that we would enter into a
new long position based on the stochastic as a threshold indicator.
The second application of the stochastic is to use both the %K
and %D together as crossover indicators. Figure 4 .11 is the same
chart we see in Figure 4.10 , except we ’ re using both the %K (black

line) and the %D (gray line). At point A, %K initially crosses up
above %D near the 20 percent threshold. We would consider this a
bullish crossover and we’ d buy the stock. We would hold the posi-
tion open until %K crosses back below %D near the upper thresh-
old. This occurs at point B in Figure 4.11 . As we can see, while this
doesn ’t let us buy the low and sell the high, it does allow us to take a
nice bite out of the uptrend.
The third application of the stochastic is to look for a divergence
between the price trend and the stochastic trend. Figure 4 .12 shows
Figure 4.12 Using the Stochastic Oscillator as a Divergence Indicator

a daily candlestick chart with %K in the middle window and volume
in the lower window. As we can see in the chart, the price highs are
getting lower while the highs on the %K are getting higher. This is a
divergence between the price and the stochastic, and it is expected
that price will correct to follow the stochastic indication. As we can
see, the price did rally toward the end of the divergence. Notice how
the rally began when the price was approaching a support level and
ended as it reached the resistance level. This is an important point:
Stochastic divergences tend to be highly subjective and should be
used as a confi rming indicator, rather than as a stand - alone signal.
Example
We’ ll use the stochastic as a crossover indicator for our example
in Figure 4 .13 . We ’ ve drawn the %K (black) with a 14 - day period
and the %D (gray) with a three - day simple smoothing. In this
example, we see a region prior to point A where both stochastic
lines are below the 20 percent threshold, indicating an oversold
condition. In order to enter the long trade, we want to see the %K
cross above both the %D line and the 20 percent threshold line.
We also want both %K and %D to be rising, which will be further
confi rmation of the expected price rally. These conditions occur
at point A, which is where we would enter the long position. The
reverse conditions are the reason for exiting the trade. After mov-
ing into the overbought territory above 80 percent, we look for

%K to cross below %D and the 80 percent mark. We ’ ll further
confi rm this by waiting until both stochastics are trending down-
ward. These conditions are met at point B, and it is here that the
position is sold.
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (M ACD )
Overview
The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator is
a trend - following indicator that combines two exponential moving
averages into an MACD line. It is used with a second line, the signal
line, which is an exponential moving average of the MACD line. The
MACD tends to work best when the stock price has long, wide swings.
Buy and sell signals are generated based on the relationship of the
MACD line to the signal line.
It is also common to use an MACD histogram, which is a graphi-
cal representation of the difference between the MACD line and the
signal line. Many traders fi nd it easier to identify crossovers and
trends with the histogram than with the crisscrossing nature of the
MACD and signal lines.
Calculation
The MACD line is a combination of two EMAs. The most common
EMAs used in constructing the MACD line are the 12- period EMA
and the 26 - period EMA. Recall from the calculation of the EMA that
a 12 - period EMA has an exponential smoothing factor of 15 percent
(cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:1)
(ESF 2/(12 1) 0.154) and the 26- period EMA has an exponen-
(cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:1)
tial smoothing factor of 7 percent (ESF 2/(26 1) 0.074). For
this reason, the 12 - day EMA and the 26- day EMA are also referred to
as the 15 percent EMA and the 7 percent EMA. The equation for the
MACD line is as follows:
(cid:1) (cid:4)
MACD 12-period EMA 26-period EMA
The second line used in the MACD indicator is the signal line.
The signal line is an exponential moving average of the MACD. As
we ’ ve seen from previous discussions, when we smooth data through
a moving average calculation, the new line is slower to respond than
the original line. For that reason, the MACD is considered the fast
line and the signal line is considered the slow line. Notice how this

mirrors the fast and slow lines in the moving average and stochastic
sections of this chapter. The equation for the signal line is:
(cid:1)
Signal line 9-period EMA of the MACD
Bear in mind that we ’ re using the common values for the MACD
calculation (12, 26, and 9); however, these values may be adjusted to
create more or less sensitivity in the indicator. Don’ t get caught up
in the minutia of tweaking these values, thinking that if you use the
10 and 33 MACD line, for example, you’ ll unlock the secret door
to the market. It’ s fi ne to increase or decrease the sensitivity of the
MACD, but you still want to confi rm your trading against the price
and volume, as we discuss through this book.
The MACD histogram is plotted as the difference between the
MACD line and the signal line or
(cid:1) (cid:4)
Histogram value MACD signal
The histogram can assume a positive or negative value, depend-
ing on whether the MACD is above or below the signal line.
Application
There are two primary applications of the MACD indicator. The
fi rst is as a crossover indicator. Once again, we look for the cross-
ing between the fast and slow lines. When the MACD line has been
trending below the signal line and then crosses up above the signal
line, we would consider this to be a bullish sign. This signal would
be especially strong if the bullish crossover occurred when the price
started to rally off a strong support level. The opposite holds true for
a bearish crossover. Here we would look for the MACD line to drop
below the signal line, preferably as the price is falling off a strong
resistance level.
Figure 4.14 shows an example of a bullish and bearish MACD
crossover. At point A, we see that the MACD line has crossed above
the signal line. Notice that the histogram is positive, however slightly.
Based on the crossover, you would buy the stock at point A. The bear-
ish crossover occurs at point B, where the histogram fi rst drops into
negative territory. This tells us that the MACD line has crossed below
the signal line, and it is here that you would exit the trade. If we look

Figure 4.14 MACD as a Crossover Indicator
more closely at the price, it ’s apparent that the stock had dropped
around $ 3 from its high before the MACD crossover generated a sell
signal. While we didn ’t sell at the peak, we see that the MACD still
got us out of the trade before the stock fell another $ 3 the next day.
The second application of the MACD is to use the histogram
as an overbought and oversold indicator. Since the MACD may
assume any range of values, as opposed to the stochastic, which
ranges from 0 to 1, we cannot assign an absolute threshold for
overbought and oversold. With the MACD, we’ re interested in
looking at extreme levels of the histogram as compared to recent
past performance. If we observe that the histogram suddenly rises
signifi cantly higher than it has at any other time in our chart
range, then that tells us that the MACD line is rapidly accelerat-
ing past the signal line. The interpretation is that the price is too
strong relative to its own past performance and, therefore, should
correct to the downside.
In Figure 4.15 , the histogram peak identifi ed is much more
extreme than the previous peaks in the chart. This indicates that
the MACD is separating from the signal line more than usual. As
such, we would expect the price to correct downward. In order to
profi t from this, we could enter a short trade when the histogram
fi rst begins to descend and then manage the trade with a trailing
stop or when the next bullish crossover occurs. It is instructive to see
how the histogram generated the sell signal almost two weeks earlier
than the bearish crossover signal.

We can see our fi rst sell signal in Figure 4.16 at point A. The stock
had been trading at a resistance level for two to three weeks when
the MACD line dropped below the signal line and the histogram
went negative. You could enter a short trade at point A and place
your buy stop above the resistance level shown. At point B, we get the
bullish crossover when the histogram turns positive, indicating that
the MACD line has crossed above the signal line. Since the recent
price lows were very close to the lows we see on the left side of the
chart, we would consider this to be our support level. It wouldn’ t be

a bad idea to not only close the short trade but reverse the position
and buy additional stock for a new long position.
A good question to consider regarding managing the long posi-
tion that we took at point B is this: Should we wait for the bearish
crossover, or do we sell the position earlier? Look at the price at the
right side of the chart. Even though the MACD didn’ t actually drop
below the signal line until the last trading day shown, there are two
fl ags that should cause us to consider selling the position before the
bearish crossover. First, the histogram rises much more steeply about
a week after point B than what we’ ve observed previously on this
chart. Second, the price rapidly rises to the resistance level and then
starts to show us potential reversal candle patterns. Given the nice
profi t we realized in about two weeks, it would be prudent to exit the
position or at least bring your trailing stop up tighter.
Bollinger Bands
Overview
Bollinger Bands are moving average envelopes that surround the
price and become wider or narrower as the price volatility increases
or decreases. There are two bands, referred to as the upper Bollinger
Band and lower Bollinger Band, respectively. Because the bands
change with volatility, the price doesn’ t often break through the
bands, although it will on occasion. Bollinger Bands must be com-
pared directly to the stock price; therefore, the bands are overlaid
into the price window and not in a separate window.
Calculation
Although there are only two bands shown, the fi rst calculation is actu-
ally a simple moving average of the price. The most common SMA
used in the construction of the Bollinger Bands is the 20- period.
While the 20 - period SMA isn ’t drawn, the upper Bollinger Band and
the lower Bollinger Band are then drawn a specifi ed distance above
and below the 20- period SMA. The distance from the 20 - period SMA
from which the bands are drawn is based on a standard deviation of
the data. A standard deviation is a statistical measure of volatility, or
data scatter. The equation for the sample standard deviation, used in
the calculation of the Bollinger Bands, is as follows:
Standard deviation (cid:1) Square root (Sum (Xi (cid:4) Xavg) 2 / n ) )

Most calculations use (n) in the denominator of the standard
deviation while others may use (n – 1). The reason for the difference
is that (n – 1 ) subtracts one (degree of freedom, in statistical terms)
to account for sampling error when the average is an estimate. This
point is included only for statistical accuracy for those who might
otherwise take us to task for this minor item. From a trading stand-
point, this is a nonissue.
Given the standard deviation, the upper Bollinger Band is then
drawn at two standard deviations above the 20- period SMA. Likewise,
the lower Bollinger Band is drawn at two standard deviations below the
20 - period SMA. Of course, two standard deviations is a common dis-
tance but, once again, this value may be adjusted. If the bands are
tightened to one standard deviation, for example, the bands will be
very narrow and will tend to generate buy and sell signals that won ’t
be very useful. However, widening the bands by using three or four
standard deviations will capture almost all of the price data but won’ t
generate signals very often. This is a balance between too tight and
too wide, which you ’ ll refi ne with practice.
Application
There are a number of ways to use the Bollinger Bands, including
identifying trend continuation when the price presses a band and as
a reversal indicator when price oscillates within the band. We’ ll focus
this discussion on one of our favorites— as a breakout indicator fol-
lowing a period of consolidation.
As we ’ ve discussed, the Bollinger Bands will alternate between
wide and narrow as the price volatility changes. Occasionally, the
bands will tighten much more than normal based on the stock’ s
historical behavior. When this happens, we see a squeeze occurring
because neither the buyers nor the sellers are taking control. Often,
this squeeze is accompanied by a decrease in volume. Think of this
situation as a pressure cooker. When the lid is placed on the buyers
and sellers, there is an increasing anticipation of who will ultimately
win the battle. Once the victor is identifi ed, traders start moving in

the direction of the winner. A squeeze, then, is often followed by a
strong breakout with increasing volume. The big question for you
as the trader is this: Which direction will the breakout go? Don ’t
try to predict the future because if you get caught on the wrong
side of the breakout, your loss could be fast and furious. Rather, wait
until there is a clear indication of the move and then join the trade.
Often, the long and narrow squeezes generate the sharpest break-
outs. Use whatever memory jogger you want, but here’ s one of ours:
“ The longer the fi ght, the sharper the fl ight. ”
Example
Figure 4 .17 clearly illustrates the Bollinger Band squeeze. Look at
how the bands narrow dramatically in the center of the chart. What
we look for is not a subtle narrowing that may or may not be con-
sidered a squeeze. The ideal tightening is one that jumps out at you
when you glance at the chart. In this example, it is possible that
you may have been fooled into taking a short position when the stock
started to push at the lower band. Without a trailing stop, you may
have then been stopped out for a small loss when the price moved
back into the band. That’ s not a problem; that’ s exactly why we use
stops. However, the true breakout is seen a short time later, and the
profi t generated from your long position on the breakout more than
paid for the initial loss from the false start.

Don ’ t Plow a Field with Your Mercedes
Hopefully, we ’ ve opened the horizon for you in understanding how
many technical tools there are available to the trader. While we’ ve
spent a few pages on the technical aspect of these tools, we want to
emphasize two important points as we wrap up this chapter.
First, make sure the tool matches the task. When your stock is
trending, don ’t use an oscillating indicator. As much as you enjoy
seeing where the Fibonacci lines fall, don’ t use them in isolation
without confi rming your trade with price and volume. We’ ve given
you tips and ideas throughout this discussion but we don ’t claim to
have laid out a comprehensive list for these indicators. If you fi nd a
couple of indicators that you like to use, take a look at some of the
many great technical analysis references that are available and learn
more about each indicator’ s strengths and limitations.
Second, always make sure you follow The Market Guys’ Keep It
Super Simple rule. After you do your study and decide which indi-
cators to use, don’ t get mired in adjusting the various parameters.
Certainly, fi nd the level of sensitivity in each indicator that works
for your trading style. Just remember, though, that trading doesn ’t
lend itself to a black box approach. That is, you’ ll never have a pro-
gram that lets you input market data and it will spew forth profi t-
able trades so that you can lie on the beach and collect checks from
your broker. Reading charts is a language. Take the time to learn
the nuances of the language, and you ’ ll fi nd the conversation much
more profi table.

10 Common Mistakes Made by
Traders (And How to Avoid Them!)
“ Nobody is worthless. Anyone can serve as a bad example. ”
I
t ’s interesting how our ingrained behavior repeats itself in many
areas of our life. Trading the markets is no exception. There are
behaviors and habits that we have developed ourselves or copied
from others. However they may have been acquired, we perpetuate
these habits because we’ ve been using them for so long. We may
recognize that our habits and behavior aren’ t helpful to our trad-
ing success, but they’ ve become a comfortable part of our routine.
Thomas Jefferson recognized this propensity in individuals when he
authored the following phrase from the American Declaration of
Independence in 1776:
. . . all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed
to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
In the following pages, we want to walk you through 10 of the
most common mistakes that we’ ve observed in many thousands of
traders. While this is by no means a comprehensive list, we hope to
give you an advantage through the Pareto principle. If you recall
from high school statistics, Pareto taught us about the 80/20 rule.

That is, most of the results come from fi xing the signifi cant few
problems. If you apply yourself toward understanding and avoiding
these 10 mistakes, you’ ll reap the benefi ts of the experiences of the
thousands of traders walking the path in front of you.
Mistake 1: Marrying Your Stock and Finding Trades
that Aren ’ t There
As much as you may like trading your favorite stock, never lose
sight of the fact that it is a fi ckle partner to build a trading busi-
ness around. Just about the time you think that the two of you have
an agreement whereby you place the trade and the stock gives you
the profi t, an event will strike that brings reality to your agreement.
Sometimes the event will give you advance warning; other times, it
will strike with the swiftness and surprise of a rattlesnake. Either way,
if you haven’ t taken the necessary steps to manage risk, you’ ll pay a
handsome price for your fi delity.
There are many reasons why traders gravitate toward one or sev-
eral stocks and trade them repeatedly. From our observation, prob-
ably the most common reason is that the trader has spent her career
with that company or within that industry and there is a comfort level
that comes from understanding the fundamentals. We often travel to
the beautiful country to our north, Canada, and speak to many trad-
ers at various seminars and expositions. Canada has a rich industry
in mining and energy, and many of our trading friends have worked
some portion of their careers in those fi elds. So we ’ re not surprised
when we start talking about uranium mining, for example, when we’ re
presenting at a seminar. Often, a trader will ask us for our opinion on
how to manage a position that they have open. Upon reviewing the
charts, we see warning signs that the technical situation is pretty weak.
The stock may be in a downtrend, with various indicators signaling
her to sell. We start to get concerned when this same trader explains
the various fundamental reasons why the stock should be going
up. The comments take some form of “ I know this company and
they ’ re overdue for a break, ” “ The industry has been stagnant for a
while and this is the season for good news, ” or “ This company has
never been in a downtrend this long before — they ’ ll rally. ”
All of these comments refl ect a belief in the company or indus-
try that stems from familiarity. Of course, as we’ ve seen many times

10 Common Mistakes Made by Traders . . . 101
in the markets, the stock price does not always move in tandem with
the company performance. Good companies have weak stocks and
lousy companies have high- fl ying stocks. If you try to justify a stock
price in the face of technical evidence to the contrary, you might
still fi nd yourself liquidating your position to cover a maintenance
call. Markets in general and stocks in particular have no require-
ment to behave rationally. The economist John Maynard Keynes is
said to have warned investors that although markets do tend toward
rational positions in the long run, “ the market can stay irrational
longer than you can stay solvent. ”
Besides coming up with great fundamental arguments about why
a stock price should move in the direction you think is right, a trader
who is married to a stock can just as easily construct a technical argu-
ment. Chart reading, as we’ v e described throughout, is subjective. If
it were completely objective, then with enough time and effort, we
would be able to program a black box trading system that takes the
market data and gives us our lineup of high- profi t trades. We know
that the reality is much different. Ten traders may see 10 different
signs in the exact same chart. We would certainly expect all 10 to
identify key features such as the overall price trend and volume trend.
But there will always be a little variation in where these traders iden-
tify support and resistance (unless they’ r e all using the same moving
averages) or which candlestick pattern is the prevailing signal.
In our example, we’ re assuming that each trader is reading the
same chart. The fact is, charts almost become like trader fi ngerprints.
Each trader has a unique layout that they ’ ve tailored to their liking.
I prefer to analyze daily candlestick charts with a 20 - day SMA and a
50 - day SMA. You like the daily bar chart with the 50 - day EMA and
the 200 - day EMA. Neither of us is right or wrong and the difference
in our charts will result in differences in our interpretation, however
great or slight. It’ s like the story of the blind men and the elephant.
One grabbed the elephant ’s tail and proclaimed the beast to be like
a rope. Another grabbed the elephant’ s trunk and said the animal
was a great snake. A third reached for the leg and declared that the
creature was most like a tree. By this point, I’ m thinking that one
more grab and they’ ll collectively fi gure the elephant to be a giant
waffl e iron.
The mistake that the loyal trader makes here is that a chart can
be tweaked enough to tell the story that you want to hear. If you
think a stock should go higher, you can almost always fi nd a chart

style, time horizon, and technical indicator combination to bolster
your belief. An unbiased observer may recognize the machinations
that you went through to “ prove ” your claim, but you ’ ll be blind to
it yourself. As we covered in Chapter 1 , a trading plan will help you
remain as objective as possible. If you need to pull out the Chaikin
volatility indicator to support your bias when you’ ve never used that
indicator before, your trading plan should help to highlight the devi-
ation. At that point, evaluate whether you ’ re analyzing your chart or
looking for the warm fuzzies for a conclusion that you’ ve already
reached.
Figure 5 .1 shows a chart with three separate trends identifi ed. Is
this stock in a downtrend, an uptrend, or channeling? The short- term
trend is upward, but it’ s reaching a resistance level marked by the
downtrend and channel lines. You can start to see how you can make
a good case for whatever decision you reach in advance. The goal of
chart reading should be to create the chart and let the data speak to
you. You should be doing the listening here, not the talking.
Finally, and this is where the marriage analogy strays from a true
marriage, why would you want to hold yourself to a few stocks when
there ’s a world of opportunity out there? Simply put, you can have a
lot more fun and reap greater rewards if you don’ t limit yourself to
the one or two stocks that you’ ve always traded. Sometimes even the
best stocks go fl at or become highly volatile (we guess this is where

the marriage analogy comes back to real life!) and you’ d do well
to just leave them alone. In the U.S. markets alone, there are over
10,000 stocks to trade. Add to that the options markets and inter-
national markets and the choices are practically endless. In down
markets, there are stocks making new highs and vice versa. Our
experience has taught us that most traders fi nd it diffi cult to sit on
their hands for extended periods without placing a trade. Without
the buffet of stocks that the full market offers, these traders will fi nd
a trade in their favorite stock, even if it ’s not there.
Mistake 2: Failing to Accept a Loss
One of the key differences between a seasoned trader and a novice
is their attitude toward a loss. A seasoned trader doesn’ t hesitate to
take a loss when the trade starts to move against him. In fact, we
would go so far as to say that the sign of a mature trader is an attitude
of welcoming a loss. We suggest celebrating a loss if the loss is small
and within the defi ned risk plan. As a trader, logging small losses into
your trading diary is the surest evidence that you have a plan that is
working to protect your positions. It is far better to accept a small loss
than to take careless risks that expose you to a signifi cant loss.
It ’s not surprising that this tendency to avoid a loss exists since
most of us come to trading from other professions. Due to the tech-
nical nature of fi nancial markets and the challenge of pitting oneself
against the ranks of highly intelligent and worthy traders, the trad-
ing profession especially attracts successful individuals from such
fi elds as engineering and the sciences. For an example, let’ s look at
the case of a medical doctor specializing in the fi eld of obstetrics.
Throughout his education, internship, and practice, he’ s taught to
exercise his profession at a level that permits no failures. It is beyond
consideration to accept a “ loss ” in the sense that we ’ re describing.
To reason that there is an acceptable loss level and that the successes
will offset the losses on balance doesn’ t even enter into his thinking.
Furthermore, by continued study and practice, this doctor will only
raise his expertise and the likelihood of a “ loss ” diminishes to virtu-
ally zero. Now this same doctor, after years of practicing medicine,
decides to take his accumulated earnings and trade his personal
portfolio. His experience has taught him that a loss is unacceptable,
and now he begins to apply that logic to his trading. In short order,
he realizes that his self - imposed requirement of a zero- loss strategy

104 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
is the very recipe for his failure. When he discovers that it is possible
to lose on 7 out of 10 trades and still be a successful trader, he has to
shed the mind- set that brought him to his initial level of success. If
his fi rst profession accepted only a 30 percent success rate, he would
certainly not be welcome in the delivery room!
We can ’t mention this point enough: It takes only one loss to
wipe out months or years of profi table trading. If you have $ 100,000
in your trading account and you take a 50 percent loss, you end up
with $ 50,000. To return to breakeven, you need to get a 100 per-
cent return, though! You took a 50 percent hit but you must double
your balance to get back to where you started. That’ s why you must
protect yourself against the single catastrophic loss. The best way to
do that is to take small losses along the way when your trade moves
against you.
Figure 5 .2 is a picture of the classic dilemma facing a trader
when it comes time to sell a position. Notice that the moving average
is trending downward. Also, look at the fact that the stock price is
no longer making new highs. It seems to have settled into a trading
range, so the trader who refuses to accept a loss begins to get com-
fortable holding the position. The problem here is that if you buy a
stock, the only way you make money is if the stock price rises. Not
going down is not the same as going up! Since we don’ t have a crystal
ball that lets us see behind the black curtain to the right of the chart,
we ’ ll assume that this trader holds the position open.

Now we have a little more information on what the stock has
done. After deciding to hold the trade in spite of the fact that the
stock wasn’ t making new highs, we see in Figure 5.3 that the stock
dipped hard shortly afterward to below $ 45. Following the dip, the
stock inched its way back up to $ 51. In retrospect, this trader should
have taken his loss at $ 54, but $ 51 isn ’t looking so bad, considering
that it was about $ 6 lower just a couple of weeks earlier. Here’ s where
the trader starts to justify his actions. “ Aha, ” he says to himself, “ it ’s
a good thing I didn ’t sell the stock. Look, it ’s coming back, and I ’ ll
soon have a profi t. ”
Of course, this rationalizing fl ies in the face of good trading prac-
tice since the stock is still in a downtrend. Worse, the stock has risen
right up to the moving average resistance line. It is at this price level
that we expect the sellers to start moving in with enthusiasm. But
the trader who refuses to accept a loss holds on. The driving force
behind his trading has become hope.
Figure 5.4 shows us the point at which the pain really starts to set
in. Having passed on the opportunity to close the trade for a minor loss
when the stock was trading at $ 54, the trader now faces a gap- down sell -
off on extremely high volume. This trader only dreams of the chance
to close the position at $ 50 now that the stock has collapsed to $ 34.
Understand in this example that the stock didn ’t drop out of the blue.
There were warning signs galore: a downward trending moving aver-
age, failure to make new highs, and climbing to resistance and failing,

Figure 5.4 Deciding When to Take a Loss—View 3
just to name a few. We ’ ve had traders come to us in situations just like
this and ask us how they can protect themselves against strong gap-
downs like this. Our fi rst question to them is, “ Why in the world were
you still in this trade in the fi rst place?! ”
It is the rare case where a stock will collapse without any warning
signs of weakness. Whether it be a failed support, a shift in volume to
the sellers, or simply the end of the uptrend, if your stock isn’ t going
up, get out!
Mistake 3: Doubling Down on a Losing Position
We’ ll actually delve into this topic in detail in Chapter 7 , but since
it ’s one of our 10 Common Mistakes, we ’ ll briefl y introduce it here.
Doubling down is a strategy that seeks to gamble a loss away. It’ s
nothing more than a contemporary market variation of a double -
or - nothing bet. This mistake is the logical next step for the trader
who made Mistake 2 (Failing to Accept a Loss). If we pick up where
we left off from Figure 5 .4 , we see that the stock is now trading at
$ 34. Let ’s assume that the trader initially purchased 1,000 shares of
the stock at $ 60. At this point, the trade is $ 26 per share out- of - the -
money. In order for the trader to simply break even, the stock price
has to rise $ 26. We ’ ve seen from the chart that the stock doesn’ t
appear to have any intention of gaining $ 26 anytime soon. So the
trader starts to think to himself, “ Hmmm, this stock probably won’ t
pick up $ 26 but it may pick up $ 13. After all, $ 13 higher is only $ 47,
and that ’s below where it fell from the resistance line.”

==================================================

10 Common Mistakes Made by Traders . . . 107
Now, if the trader just sits back and holds his position, he needs
a $ 26 rally to break even. However, he begins to reason that the $ 13
rally is possible. The only way to break even from a $ 13 rally is to buy
another 1,000 shares at $ 34. You see, he spent $ 60,000 for the fi rst
trade and $ 34,000 for the second. That’ s a total of $ 94,000 for 2,000
shares or $ 47 per share. Therefore, when the stock moves back up to
$ 47, he breaks even. No loss, no gain.
The problem with this strategy is that nothing has changed in the
dynamic of the stock. That ’s fi ne that the trader wants to break even
at $ 47, but the stock is still in a downtrend and the sellers are still
in control. The most likely outcome from this approach is that the
stock will continue moving down and the trader is now losing money
at twice the rate. Sometimes, traders will apply this strategy again, hop-
ing against hope for a rally that will save them from self- destruction.
By the time the pain becomes too great to bear, this trader may be
holding on to 4,000 or more shares that are all losing money.
Figure 5.5 shows a stock that started over $ 800 per share! It’ s
hard to imagine that such a strong stock could fall far. People who
bought the stock at these levels didn’ t think in terms of the stock’ s
losing 90 percent of its value. It’ s easy to convince yourself that this
stock is a bargain at $ 700 because it was just recently trading at $ 800.
But if you haven ’t seen an example like this in your own trading,
learn the lesson from others who have. Every stock has only one
support level that will never be broken — zero. Anything above that is
subject to the sellers pushing it further down.

Mistake 4: Lack of Training and Preparation
Think for a minute about a mutual fund. You send your money to
a fund and it is pooled with every other investor ’s funds. The man-
agement team then makes the buy and sell decisions, guided by the
fund prospectus. For the privilege of having a professional manage-
ment team, you pay a fund expense each year. Some funds may be as
little as ½ percent or less. Others may charge fees of 2 to 3 percent or
more. The point here is that you ’ re relinquishing your right to make
the trading decisions to the fund managers. Obviously, they have a
fi duciary responsibility to use their skills and judgment to maximize
the growth of your assets. If they are able to increase the value of
your assets by 10 percent, they will receive their management fee.
If they increase the value of your assets by only 2 percent, they will
receive their management fee. If they fail and the value of your assets
declines, they will receive their management fee. You see where we’ re
going? Most traders and investors hold some type of mutual fund or
funds and give no thought to the fund expense. We suspect that the
reason it isn’ t considered is that you never actually write a check for
the expense— it simply reduces the value of your investment. Per-
haps it ’s like the direct withdrawal of income taxes. It would be a lot
more painful if you received your full wages and then had to return
a portion to the government to settle your tax liability.
Now the reason you’ re reading this book is quite likely because
you have decided to make your own buy and sell decisions for at
least some portion of your portfolio. An alternative reason is that
you have absolutely no interest in trading but yet you suffer from
congenital insomnia and previous remedies have fallen short. For
the former, we ’ re going to suggest that you implement your own
management fees. Instead of paying the fees to a team of outside
managers, create your own education account. This account should
be used to help you become a better manager of your own money.
Set aside 1 percent of the amount of money that you’ re personally
managing and use that as your training and preparation account. If
you have a $ 100,000 portfolio and you’ re actively managing $ 20,000,
then each year you have $ 200 to spend on becoming a better investor
and trader. We ’ re always amazed at how many people are willing
to lose many thousands of dollars due to bad trading decisions or
practices, but they refuse to invest even a minimal amount in their
education. Look at your trading history and see if you can identify

a trade or two that could have been avoided if you knew a bit more
about technical analysis. How much did you lose on those trades?
In Chapter 1 we talked about the importance of including edu-
cation as a component of your trading plan. We want to emphasize
again that we subscribe to the Keep It Super Simple philosophy when
it comes to market training and education. There are many trainers
and teachers out there who will try to convince you that you have to
study deep and wide in various aspects of technical analysis before
you can unlock the secrets of the market. Just last night, we received
an e- mail with the title, “ Profi ts Keep Pouring In!!! ” The marketer
went on to describe how a particular options sage had generated
massive profi ts from a little- known six- legged option spread. How
easy would it be to think that the reason you’ re not profi ting in a par-
ticular market is that you don’ t know how to create this complicated
multileg option trade?
The fact is that the ingredients necessary for trading and invest-
ing success are pretty simple. Like learning a language, though, the
best foundation is laid when you take the time to learn a piece at a
time and spend plenty of time practicing. For example, it is possible
to attend a crash course and learn charting, technical indicators,
and stock strategies all at the same time. But it becomes a bit over-
whelming when you try to put it all into practice at the same time.
A better approach would be to learn how to read a candlestick chart.
Then go out and start reading many candlestick charts to see how the
patterns develop. Something will just not click, perhaps identifying
certain reversal patterns. So you take another course, read another
book, or attend another seminar and learn a bit more. Gradually,
you develop the recognition skills that will allow you to fi nd the pat-
terns more quickly and easily.
As in any other area of life, you should never stop learning. Trad-
ing and investing is no exception. How long does it take to be a mas-
ter of the basics? The Market Guys will freely admit that we continue
to learn every day. Sometimes it’ s a tip or trick that we once knew
but have forgotten to apply at the right time. Sometimes it’ s more
fundamental in order to keep up with the ever- changing tide of
the markets. This is especially important with the changes that we
see every year in technology and shifts in how the markets operate.
What will the impact on your trading be when all of the markets
move to 24- hour trading? If you rely on a gap trading strategy, will
you be prepared when there are no more gaps?

110 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
You need to make sure that you never lose sight of the other
participants in the market. Even though you may be trading alone in
the isolation of your home offi ce, there are many traders out there
who are striving for every advantage in the markets. Do you really
want to enter that arena without adequate training and prepara-
tion? We can assure you that there are many traders who will be
trading the same stocks as you who have done their homework and
have properly equipped themselves.
Picture yourself getting ready to walk on to the fi eld of play at an
NFL football game. Across the line from you is the defensive team.
The tackles have spent the entire preseason in the weight room
building up muscle mass and strength. They’ ve done countless drills
on the fi eld, maximizing their cardio fi tness and endurance. They ’ ve
sat through hours of tapes in order to understand the strategies that
could be employed against them in any given situation. Finally,
they ’ ve taped their joints, donned the pads, and slipped on the hel-
met for action. Now it’ s time for you to stroll onto the fi eld with the
singular objective of getting the ball across the line for a goal. You ’ re
feeling pretty comfortable in your loafers and khaki shorts. No cum-
bersome pads for you; you’ re well appointed in a light button - up shirt.
Your preseason was spent in air - conditioned comfort, munching on
a bag of chips. You ’ ve heard about some of the defense plays that
could be coming your way, but you haven’ t learned how to recognize
them or counter the moves. How reasonable is it to expect that you’ ll
be able to outmaneuver the defense and actually score? Why is it that
so many traders and investors enter the fi eld of play in the markets
with the same level of training and preparation and yet still somehow
expect that they’ ll be able to score? The markets will occasionally
reward the lucky, but only the well- trained and prepared investor or
trader will be in it for the long run.
Mistake 5: Trading with Scared Money
Mistake 5 often is the direct result of having made Mistake 2 (Failing to
Accept a Loss) or Mistake 4 (Lack of Training and Preparation). You
trade with scared money when you’ ve had a bad trade and now you’ re
gun shy. The term g un shy refers to hunting dogs who have developed a
fear of guns. Sometimes this occurs through an accident of some sort,
like getting hit with a spent shell casing. Sometimes, it ’s just the loud
report that creates a fear within the dog. However it starts, the dog is

incapable of working near a hunter, often running at the mere sight
of a gun. Unless the dog was born gun shy, it takes much patience and
retraining to get the dog back to where she can point and retrieve with-
out trembling in fear. You have to start small and easy and gradually
build the dog ’s confi dence.
A gun - shy trader is the same way. You took a trade that started
in your direction, and so you decided to relax your risk manage-
ment discipline. Perhaps you canceled your stop order protection
and went away for a few days. After all, the trade was moving in a
profi table direction, so you felt as though you didn’ t need to man-
age it. When you came back, the stock had dropped 40 percent on
a bad earnings announcement. For a day or so, you walk around
zombie - like, incredulous at the turn in fortune. When you regain
your senses and close the position, you’ ve suffered a catastrophic
loss. If you have the funds remaining to continue trading, you
will certainly not enter the next trade with the same level of confi -
dence that you had on the last trade. Like the shaking, gun - shy dog,
the mere hint of a drop in price will cause you to tremble and
close the position at market.
Another type of gun- shy trader is the person who doesn ’t yet
understand the mechanics and strategies of trading, but starts to trade
anyway. This trader is the football player we described in M istake 4
(Lack of Training and Preparation). Oblivious to the defensive team
staring him down, he struts onto the playing fi eld. The whistle blows,
the play starts, and our khaki- clad trader is stomped into the turf.
Chances are very good that on the next play, he’ ll be running toward
his own goal line in an attempt to avoid getting stomped twice.
Scared money results in the trader’ s taking one of two courses
of action. The fi rst course of action is that the trader will attempt
to gamble his way out of his mistakes. This is the trader who failed to
accept a loss, took a 40 percent hit on a single trade, and fi gured that
it ’s time for him to double his money on the next trade. This trader
allows the scared money to turn him into a Wild West gambler. The
initial trade may have been a sound initial entry, purchasing 800
shares of a stock trading at $ 50. The scared money trade, however, is
5,000 shares of a $ 3 stock. The trader hopes that his stock will rally
to $ 10 and he’ ll walk away with a handsome $ 35,000 profi t. More
times than not, the $ 3 stock becomes a $ 1 stock as the gamble fails to
pay off. To reinforce this point, go back to Chapter 1 and review the
section on the trader - versus - gambler personality.

112 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
The second course of action that may be taken by the gun- shy
trader who is trading with scared money is more common. Rather
than going for broke and trying to make up the loss in one fell
swoop, the trader will hold the trade very close to the vest in order to
avoid any more pain. In this scenario, the trader buys a stock at $ 50
and immediately places a sell stop order at $ 49.99. After losing her
penny, she looks for the next trade. She fi nds a stock in an uptrend
and buys it at $ 44. She immediately places her sell stop at $ 43.99.
Do you see what ’s happening? This trader is terrifi ed of taking a loss
of the magnitude that created her fear in the fi rst place. She knows
better than to think that she can recover her losses in a single trade
but she doesn’ t have the confi dence to allow the market to breathe.
As such, each trade is choked with a small loss that slowly but surely
creates the very loss she was trying to avoid.
A common mistake in trader thinking is that tightening the stop
will result in reduced loss. While the loss per trade may be smaller,
the frequency of losses will increase. This offsets any advantage
that the smaller loss may yield. Remember, you should always let the
chart tell you where to place the stop, based on support or resist-
ance. If you approach a trade with an acceptable loss amount already
in mind, you ’ re attempting to tell the market what you want. Unfor-
tunately, the market doesn ’t care what you want.
Mistake 6: Buying Cheap Options
While we touch on the subject of options throughout this book,
our intent isn’ t for this to serve as a comprehensive options trading
guide. Nevertheless, since we present 10 Common Mistakes Made
by Traders, we didn’ t want to discount the list by 10 percent and
only list 9 Common Mistakes Made by Traders. With options, you
usually get what you pay for. Cheap options generally have only time
value in their price. There isn’ t any intrinsic value that ’s refl ected
in the premium. The salient point is this: The value of the option
lies in the speculative worth based on where the underlying stock
could move. That is, the premium price is grounded on what might
happen, not on any intrinsic value at the present time.
Interestingly, the same principle applies to many penny stocks.
We could just as easily label this mistake “ B uying Cheap Stocks.” Sure,
it is possible to fi nd value stocks where the company’ s fundamental
worth is discounted through the stock price. Some measures

10 Common Mistakes Made by Traders . . . 113
of the underlying worth of a company may be the dividend yield,
the price- to - book ratio, or many other varieties of accounting metrics.
However, just because a stock price is cheap doesn ’t mean that the com-
pany is discounted. The stock price can be manipulated many ways.
Often, when a stock price falls too far, a company will announce a reverse
stock split. That accounting maneuver alone may cause the price to
move from $ 5 per share to $ 15 per share in a three - for - one reverse
split. It ’s the same company but with a new stock price. Has anything
changed? Of course not, but now the perception of cheap and expen-
sive is shifted.
One of the reasons that traders fl ock to cheap stocks and options
is the number of shares that can be purchased for a fi xed amount
of buying power. If you have $ 50,000, you can choose between 1,000
shares of a $ 50 stock or 25,000 shares of a $ 2 stock. Traders start fan-
tasizing about the $ 2 stock gaining another $ 2, and they tally up the
$ 50,000 profi t. If the $ 50 stock moves up $ 2, they ’ re only looking at
banking a $ 2,000 profi t. Could the $ 2 stock double? Yes, but it could
also drop to $ 1. Now that cheap little stock just swallowed $ 25,000
from your account.
You should take the time to burn the image of Figure 5.6 into
your mind. Notice the price scale on the vertical axis of the chart. This
stock is trading at around $ 3 on the left side of the chart. Without
the benefi t of being able to see into the future on the right side of the
chart, it would be easy to rationalize how this should be a $ 10 stock.

It ’s especially easy to do that if the stock has recently dropped down
from that level. The thinking is that if it were trading at $ 10 or $ 20
just six months ago, surely it could jump back up to $ 8, $ 10, or more!
Instead, the stock continued its downward spiral until it became a $ 1
stock. Cheap stocks don’ t always go up; sometimes they go bankrupt.
Mistake 7: Overcomplicating the Analysis
If you think Fibonacci was a pianist, you’ re probably not making this
mistake. For the rest of you, we have these words of advice: “ Lighten
up! ” We ’ ll repeat our philosophy many times over throughout this
book. Keep It Super Simple. The reason we have to drill this thinking
into our minds is that at every turn we ’ re programmed by marketing
messages that convince us that we’ ll succeed in the market if we only
take the time to learn that which we don’ t currently know. It’ s a little
like the guy who was asked how much money it would take to make him
happy. His response was, “ A little more. ” A little more knowledge is
not always a good thing if the knowledge takes you down a rabbit
hole of useless information. As we write this section, we’ re looking
at the front cover advertisement in a popular trading magazine. The
software provider (who shall remain anonymous) is proclaiming that
they provide over 100 free and proprietary technical analysis studies.
For crying out loud! If you need to cherry pick from 100 propri-
etary studies before you can identify a trading opportunity, then we
strongly suggest that you consider switching to decaf.
In engineering, we discuss a concept known as signal - to - noise
ratio. Essentially, this is a measure of the useful information (signal)
to the useless or irrelevant information (noise). The goal is to maxi-
mize the signal while minimizing the amount and effect of the noise.
It ’s ironic that engineers, who must understand this concept in
order to qualify as a professional engineer, are some of the most egre-
gious transgressors when it comes to the markets. Traders who come
from more technical backgrounds have spent their careers learning
more advanced methodologies for solving problems. The disconnect
between an engineering or scientifi c endeavor and the stock markets
is that the former is generally deterministic while the latter is proba-
bilistic. We’ ll appeal to the purists who will take us to task for failing to
recognize the probabilistic nature of quantum physics. You’ ll appreci-
ate that such a discussion would certainly qualify as an extreme tan-
gent for this book.

Nevertheless, the sciences have given us fi rm rules regarding the
world around us. The energy of a body in motion, kinetic energy,
is one half the body ’s mass times the velocity squared. It has always
been such and will continue to be. It doesn’ t even matter where
you ’ re located in the world. But the markets, being probabilistic,
do not always give us a falling stock price when a shooting star can-
dle pattern occurs at the top of an uptrend. It’ s important that the
trader understand this because this is the reason why you cannot
create a black box trading system. As far as we know, there isn ’t
anyone sitting on the beach in the Caribbean collecting checks
from her broker while her trading system automatically executes
winning trades.
Since we recognize that maximizing the signal while minimiz-
ing the noise is important, we have to ensure that we’ re not adding
to the noise by layering on scanners, tickers, screens, charts, and
lists. Success in the market is not dependent on the one technical
tool that you haven ’t yet acquired. When we meet traders who have
fallen into this trap, we like to walk them through a very basic proc-
ess. First, clear everything off the chart except price and volume.
The price may be in your favorite form: candlestick, line, bar, and so
on. Second, identify support and resistance role reversal levels. This
is explained in much more detail in the following chapter. Third,
add confi rming indicators as appropriate for the market. In other
words, if you ’ re trading a trend, use a moving average. If your stock
is channeling, consider adding a Bollinger Band or other oscillating
indicator. Whatever you choose for the third step, be judicious in the
application. If you get to step three and then add your top 10 techni-
cal indicators, you ’ ve defeated the purpose of the exercise. Stop and
ask yourself if the chart in Figure 5 .7 is really the best layout to help
you fi nd trading opportunities.
Finally, the trader who is constantly overanalyzing a trade setup
is usually the last one to actually place the trade. We refer to this
condition as Paralysis by Analysis. By the time he’ s convinced him-
self that he found a good trade, he’ s missed the better part of the
move. We don ’t think it ’s a coincidence that the fi rst four letters of
“ analysis ” describe this personality completely. It is true that the per-
fect trade will occasionally present itself. Much more often, though,
is the arrival of the imperfect trade that requires a combination of
technical analysis paired with the judgment born from many previ-
ous trades.

Mistake 8: Unrealistic Expectations
Use your imagination for a moment with us. Let’ s assume that you
went to Wal- Mart and purchased enough 12 - inch rulers to lay end
to end along the equator. That’ s right— you ’ ve just set down a line
of rulers measuring 24,900 miles long. On the back of one of these
rulers, you place a red dot and then you turn the ruler back over.
Your friend comes along and starts at any point on the equator
and begins to walk. His objective is to select a stopping point, bend
down, and turn over the ruler. Is it realistic to expect that he will
walk 1, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 miles along the ruler path and happen
to reach for the very ruler that you marked with a red dot? If this
picture sounds absurd to you, then why do thousands of people
each day play the lottery? The Mega Millions lottery, played in 12
U.S. states, has a jackpot with lower odds of winning than fi nding
our marked ruler.
In the trading world, unrealistic expectations don’ t take the
form of expecting to get $ 100 million from a $ 1 investment. That
stretches the believability factor too much for us. But 700 percent
returns each month start to enter our thinking. We once had a trader
come to us with a $ 2,000 trading account. He wanted to know which
strategies he could employ that would let him live off of his trading
account. We fi rst questioned him about how much he needed to
live. Based on the size of his trading account, we were intrigued that
he thought he could live on $ 50 per month. Instead, he told us
cc0055..iinndddd 111166 1111//22//0077 1122::1199::0022 PPMM

that he needed at least $ 5,000 each month for his living expenses.
He actually thought he could cash fl ow $ 5,000 each month from
his $ 2,000 trading capital. That ’s $ 60,000 annually for a whopping
3,000 percent return. We told him that if he could fi gure out how
to consistently draw a 3,000 percent return, he should immediately
open a hedge fund and we ’ d be the fi rst investors.
The fi rst and most realistic expectation from trading the markets
is simply to outperform the broad market. If the Dow Jones Industrial
Average is up 10 percent, your trading should be up more than 10
percent after commissions and expenses. If the Nasdaq 100 is down
5 percent, your trading should be up or at least down less than 5 per-
cent. The bottom line is: If you can’ t outperform the broad market,
stop trading! It’ s much easier and profi table for you to place your
money in a broad market exchange - traded fund (DIA, SPY, QQQQ)
or an index mutual fund. These, at least, will track the market and
you don ’t have to make any buy and sell decisions.
Remember this rule: If you want to get rich quickly, go somewhere
else. If you want to get poor quickly, keep trading with the belief that
you can get rich quickly. Even the ancient King Solomon recognized
this fact of building wealth when he wrote, “ The plans of the diligent
lead to profi t as surely as haste leads to poverty ” ( Proverbs 21:5).
Mistake 9: Using Software Crutches
Software can be a great tool, or it can be a monumental waste of time.
We’ ve watched countless traders fi ddle with their trading software in
a classic case of going nowhere fast. Activity should not be confused
with productivity in the markets. Traders who are using software as
a crutch would be completely lost if they were handed a printed
copy of a chart. They couldn’ t tack on their favorite indicator, toggle
between time frames, or pull up the latest news on the stock. There
are many great software packages available to traders. As we warned
in Mistake 7 (Overcomplicating the Analysis), you don’ t have to use
all of the available tools.
Software can also become a crutch when a trader ceases to learn
the language of technical analysis and instead attempts to program
his own trading robot. Countless hours are spent refi ning a trading
system and back - testing it against historical market data. This trader
is not developing any useful trading skills; rather, he ’s spinning his
wheels in pursuit of the black box, which doesn’ t exist. For him, the

118 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
software has become the goal. His every effort and motivation is
mastering the software, and he rarely, if ever, actually trades.
Software should never be a substitute for learning, either.
Unfortunately, technical analysis is sometimes too quick and easy on
contemporary trading platforms. We can easily trick ourselves into
thinking that we have an advantage in the market simply because
we have the latest and greatest charting/programming/scanning
package. If all of trading boiled down to the software, we wouldn’ t
have charts, indicators, screens, and the like. We would turn on
the computer, launch the software, and select one of two buttons
that appear on the screen: “ Buy the Stock” or “ Sell the Stock for a
Profi t. ” The more advanced software platforms would be equipped
with two more buttons: “ Buy the Option” and “ Sell the Option for a
Profi t. ” Ah, that the world of trading were that easy.
Mistake 10: Trading without a Plan
We covered the importance of a trading plan in detail in Chapter 1 ,
but we want to add just a couple more thoughts to this point. Be sure
that you learn from your successes and failures. If you record both
as part of your trading plan, you’ ll be able to adjust your actions
and strategies twice as effectively. Remember, also, to occasionally
ask yourself the question, “ Why am I trading?” Your trading plan
is built around the answer to this fundamental question. For most
traders, the answer to this question will evolve or completely change
over time. It will follow the shifting of goals and priorities that occur
throughout life. Be sure that your plan lives and breathes with you.
Your plan should serve your purposes rather than your becoming a
slave to your plan. Sometimes walking the well- worn path is not the
best. Learn from the mistakes made by others before you, and grow
on your journey toward trading success.

hapter 3 covered the mechanics behind the steps in drawing a
support level on a price chart, which is nothing more than identify-
ing areas where buyers have displayed a history of buying. Here, we
will be discussing the reasons why buyers buy when they do. You will
see that as you continue to hone your technical analysis skills, certain
price patterns will seem to jump out of the chart at you.
One of these patterns is the role reversal support pattern. We
have found that this pattern can be seen on virtually every chart you
look at. Day traders will see this pattern on intraday charts that meas-
ure increments of minutes while swing traders will fi nd this pattern
on daily charts over the course of the year. Even the long term inves-
tor will fi nd this on weekly charts that include many years of data,
so it doesn’ t really matter what time frame you are using, it will be
there.
In our examples we will be using simple line charts that track the
closing price of the stock each and every day. There are a couple of
reasons why we use line charts. First, they’ re clean and simple, which
makes it easier on the eye when going through your chart scans. Sec-
ond, we put more weight in the closing price than any other price
point. In order to understand the reasons why so many analysts favor
the closing price over all of the other data points, we have to get
into the mind of a professional trader. There is an old saying that
the amateurs open the market each day, while the professionals close

the market. At the end of each trading day, mutual fund companies
go through the routine of settling their positions to calculate net asset
value (NAV) for each fund they manage. This process includes teams
of people who go through each and every company held in the fund
to ensure that there are no price errors or mistakes made that would
affect the NAV; otherwise, this could be costly to the fund company.
There are times when news, either positive or negative, is released
on one or more of the companies held in the fund, at which time
the fund manager has to determine whether this news adds any risk
to the fund and if, after consulting with the risk managers, the fund
manager feels the risk outweighs the rewards of holding the position,
the manager will liquidate some or all of the position to limit that
risk. If you take our example of just one mutual fund company and
multiply this by the many thousands of mutual funds that are traded
each day, you will see why there are volume surges in the last hour of
the trading day.
Market Mechanics
Risk managers are doing what they do best which is minimizing
downside exposure to the companies they work for. Along with
the mutual fund companies, the market makers and hedge fund
managers are adding to the closing volume of the market as they
assess positions to determine whether they are comfortable with
holding a particular long or short position overnight.
Before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began
phasing in their special order handling rules in 1997, market mak-
ers had an easier time making money for the fi rms they worked for.
The way it would work is if you, the investing public, entered an
order to buy or sell a particular security, your order was entered
through your broker and then routed to a market maker, who would
then execute the transaction for you. The market makers had spe-
cial privileges that allowed them to either take the opposite side
of your order — meaning if you were a buyer of a stock, they could
sell you that stock out of their inventory — or they could just show
your order to the rest of the market makers, allowing them to take
the other side of your buy order. The one thing you may not have
known if you were an investor back in those days is that your market
maker had the ability to buy stock for their account at prices below

were trading in fractions of a dollar, so here is an example of what
this might have looked like:
A particular market for a stock you may have been interested
in might have shown a bid price of $ 24 and an offering price of
$ 24 ½ , at which time you may have entered an order to buy stock
somewhere in the middle for 24 ¼ . Your market maker was not obli-
gated to show your buy order, and most of the time they wouldn’ t
show your order to the open market. Instead, what they would do is
post a bid for their own account through a system known as Instinet,
which was a trading system reserved primarily for market makers and
institutions. If the market maker posted a bid for $ 241⁄ , there was a
8
good chance they could buy stock an eighth of a dollar cheaper than
your buy price. Therefore, if you were trying to buy 1,000 shares for
24¼, they would buy 1,000 shares for their own account at 241 ⁄ on
8
Instinet, then quickly sell you your shares at 24¼ and pocket a quick
profi t of $ 125 with no risk at all to their own account. On top of this
you were being charged a hefty commission for the transaction and
in the end you probably thought you were getting a good deal from
your broker.
For example:
1. M arket for ABC stock is 24 bid offered at 24 ½ .
2. Y ou enter an order to buy 1,000 shares of ABC stock at 24 ¼ .
3. M arket maker buys 1,000 shares at 241 ⁄ on Instinet.
8
4. M arket maker sells 1,000 shares to you at 24 ¼ .
5. R ealized profit for market maker is 1 ⁄ (cid:1) 1,000 (cid:2) $ 125.
8
This would happen many thousands of times each day, but thanks
to the SEC this abuse has, for the most part, been e liminated. What the
SEC order handling rules have also done is force the market makers to
take risk for their own accounts. This means that market m akers now
have to take open positions in the market in order to profi t, and this
opens them up to more risk.
What does this mean for you, the individual trader? It means that
if you want to cut down on your own risk exposure, you don’ t want to
be on the opposite side of these market makers. They see order fl ow
better than you do, and they also have much deeper pockets than
you do. In other words, although the SEC order - handling rules allow
for full transparency for most small orders, not all orders are being
shown. Larger orders, particularly those entered by the i nstitutions,

are not being displayed to the general public, and they like it this
way. If you were an institutional trader looking to move a very large
amount of money and you were thinking about buying a stock, do
you think you would want to have everyone in the world knowing
what your intentions were? Of course you wouldn’ t . If you entered
a large buy order into the market that represented many millions
of dollars in buying power, what do you think that would do to the
price of the stock if everyone knew there was a big buyer coming in?
First of all, it would scare away any of the smaller sellers. Second,
it would cause any larger sellers to raise their sell limits to see how
far the buyers would chase them. Finally, momentum traders would
jump on the bandwagon and try to jump ahead of the big buy order
to take a short ride with the intentions of making a quick profi t on
a price rally brought on buy this new demand in the stock. It would
be the same on the sell side. If an institution decided to show a large
sell order in the open market, the buyers would run for the hills and
the price would drop like a rock.
Many times, the market makers are given discretion to com-
plete the order over a series of days or even weeks. This allows them
to fi ll the order little by little without drawing too much attention to
themselves. They would just stay on the bid price if they had a big
institutional buy order, or they would just stay on the offering price
if they had a large sell order they were working. When market mak-
ers are not working any large institutional orders, they spend most
of their day reading order fl ow. If they see that there is good news
on a stock, chances are the majority of orders that come into their
book that day will be buy orders. This is because the general pubic
act like sheep and will react to this good news by buying the stock
on the day the news is released. Market makers will favor the buy side
in a situation like this because the good news adds to the price sup-
port as the news creates short- term demand for the shares. Also,
should there be an unexpected price drop during the day, they can
quickly get out by selling to the next buy order they have sitting in
their p ending order fi le . This allows them to effi ciently manage loss
to their own account. What they are doing here is using the pub-
lic order fl ow as a stop loss feature. With the click of the mouse
they can quickly sell out of their entire position if they feel the buy
orders are starting to slow down. This is one of the great benefi ts of
being a market maker, and it’ s a luxury you will have to live without
as an individual trader.

The Role Reversal 125
Here is an example of how a market maker would use their order
fl ow to profi t in the market:
The market for a particular stock is 24 bid offered at 24.02. The
market maker sees that he has a large number of buyers in his
order book who are stacked up on the bid side. There are a
total of 10,000 shares in this pending order file, all bidding $ 24.
So the market maker buys 10,000 shares at 24.02 for his own
account. If the price of the stock goes up, the market maker will
realize a profit. If the price of the stock does not go up, then the
market maker will sell 10,000 shares from his account to those
looking to buy stock at $ 24.
As you can see, this would cost the market maker only $ 200 if he is
wrong. However, when he is right, he will make a lot more than $ 200
because as the price of the stock goes up, those buyers he had in his
book will most likely chase the market. This is when people who were
trying to buy the stock at $ 24 move their limits up because they did
not get to buy the stock when it was lower. You may have done this
yourself. Market makers count on the general public’ s chasing the
market. There is even a term that’ s used to describe this action. It’ s
called stepping up . Professional traders who trade for market making
fi rms love it when you step up on your limit order. This allows them
to capture profi ts pretty effortlessly.
Before you make a decision to day trade for a living, remember
that your odds aren’ t even close to being as good as a market maker
who earns a good living trading the markets. We want to reiterate the
importance of having a fi ne - tuned discipline when managing risk
in the market. Learning about how a market maker profi ts in the
market will help you increase the odds in your favor when you are
taking a position in the market for your own account.
From the examples we have given you so far with regard to how
professional traders deal with risk in the market, you can see that a mar-
ket maker will be siding with the order fl ow. If the order fl ow is on the
buy side of the market, then chances are the market maker is going to
be a buyer. If the order fl ow is on the sell side of the market, perhaps
owing to bad news, then the market maker is going to be playing the
short side of the market. If the market maker is aggressively attacking
the long side of a trade, you can be certain that they have their eye
on the downside risk and will be quick to take a loss if the buyers start

to thin out in their pending book of orders. They are good at what they
do, and they make money because they are reading the market with a
trained eye and a strict set of rules for trading.
Your Opinion Won ’ t Move a Market
So why is it that so many traders who trade their own accounts from
home lose money? The number one reason most people lose money
trading their own accounts is that they have developed an opinion for
the stock and this opinion draws them away from the obvious signals
given through the price charts. Adding an opinion to a trading strat-
egy will most likely doom the strategy from the very beginning.
From what we are seeing in our travels, there are still far too many
people out there who are trying to buy stocks on yearly lows thinking
that they have found the bottom. They do just enough research to
justify the price as one of value, and at fi rst glance this idea might
seem sensible. But many times this bargain- hunting strategy quickly
sours after this same stock drops to another 52- week low a short week
later. The next thing they do is dig into the fi nancial reports search-
ing for a reason why they should hold on to this new losing position.
Then they search the analyst reports, and after a while they commit
to the good old strategy of “ Just hold on; it will get better. ” From
there, it develops into a “ Hold on until I can get out at my breakeven
point. ” There are price levels at which the general public reaches
their goal in this amazing pursuit of breakeven, and we call it the
role reversal point.
Our objective for this chapter is to bring you to a place where you
have realized that the support line on the chart is also your fi nancial
lifeline. If you follow these easy steps in constructing a proper s upport
line, you will fi nd that this will allow you to absorb small losses when
you are wrong, while allowing you to stay in the market by preserving
your buying power. This will give you more opportunities to be right,
which in turn means more profi ts down the road. We also encourage
you to make sure you are buying your stocks as close as you can to a
support level and not a resistance level. Should you do this, then you
have once again increased the odds in your favor.
Defining Role Reversal

point, we need to get into the minds of those who consistently

The Role Reversal 127
lose money when trading the markets. One of the most popular
misconceptions around is that in order to make money in the stock
market you need to buy low and sell high. We have all heard it
before, but what does this really mean? For most people this means
that you should try to buy a stock at a lower price than where it is cur-
rently trading. Then the intention is to sell this position for a profi t
after the stock has gone up. If you dig deeper into this practice, you
will fi nd that in order for you to buy a stock at a lower price, the
stock will have to fall to the price at which you are trying to buy it.
Immediately, you are stacking the odds against you. Remember, the
market makers are going to be happy to sell you the stock they own
at this point because you are helping them limit their losses. Playing
this scenario out, we will take this strategy to the next level, which
is what the amateur traders do once they have realized that they
were not lucky enough to pick the bottom. Once the buyer of this
depressed stock suffers a downturn in the market, they justify the
position by digging into the fundamentals of the company. After
another round of a nalysis, they jump into the popular strategy called
cost averaging down .
Dollar Cost Averaging versus Cost Averaging Down
You may have heard of an investment strategy called d ollar cost
averaging . This is where investors deposit small amounts of money
each month into an account that has been set up to automatically
purchase shares in a mutual fund equal to the amount deposited.
The goal is to accumulate shares in a retirement portfolio without
having to suffer the pain of enduring extreme price swings brought
on by market volatility. The most attractive thing about this strategy
is that is allows us to accumulate more shares of the fund as the price
drops, and over time we fi nd that the shares we’ ve accumulated
at the lower price levels add to the performance of our portfolio
when the price of the shares goes up to a new high. However, there
is one catch: We need the mutual fund to go up in price for this to
work. Otherwise, we have accumulated a lot of worthless shares in
a retirement account designed to help us with a long- term plan for
our golden years.
So with a dollar cost averaging strategy, it is wise to make sure
your money is going into a fund that is in a steady, yet not too aggres-
sive, upward trend. Notice in Figure 6.1 how a $ 250 per month

A Good Plan Gone Bad
Dollar cost averaging is a very good plan for individuals who are
putting money aside to supplement an existing pension plan or
individual retirement account (IRA). However, as good as it is, you
should not rely on this investment as a sole source of income for your
retirement years unless you are contributing signifi cant amounts of
money each and every month to it (s ignifi cant meaning percentages
that exceed 15 percent of your gross annual income). Dollar cost
averaging is considered an investment strategy, and although it is

The Role Reversal 129
one that is recommended by most fi nancial advisers, you should not
try to combine this strategy with a short - term trading strategy.
Somewhere along the way this good plan went bad when some-
one decided to apply it to their trading account. What they wound
up with is a common practice called c ost averaging down , which is
where amateur traders buy more of a stock that is going down in
order to lower the cost basis of a stock that is hurting them. This is
nothing more than an effort to trade out of a losing position. In the
end, most people wind up with a very bad situation that ultimately
loses very large sums of money. It’ s amazing to see just how many
people have bought into this idea as being a good strategy.
The story usually starts off like this:
Trader Bob decides to buy 1,000 shares of ABC stock at $ 30 per
share. Immediately after purchasing these shares, the stock drops
to $ 29 and Trader Bob gets a sick feeling in his stomach as he
realizes that he made a bad decision. But does Trader Bob do
anything to fix this problem? No! Instead, he makes a decision
to hold on to this trade because he believes the stock will even-
tually rebound. The following day the stock drops to $ 26 per
share, and instead of getting out and limiting his loss, Trader
Bob makes a decision to buy another 1,000 shares at $ 26 in an
effort to lower his cost basis $ 28 per share. Now Trader Bob is
long twice as many shares, and the stock drops again, resulting
in a doubling of the losses.
This story is told over and over again around the world, as many
other traders do the same each and every day.
Pursuit of the Breakeven Point
We work hard for our money, and it doesn’ t make sense to waste any
of it gambling in the market. This market is too good for us to be
pursuing the breakeven point. If you are planning to invest for your
retirement, then do yourself and your family a favor and make sure
you have a good, solid plan to follow. Dollar cost averaging is one
of those good plans you can use if your plan is to invest a consistent
amount of money in a retirement account each month. Just be sure
that you are buying mutual funds, exchange- traded funds (ETFs), or

index funds that are in upward- sloping trends. However, if your plan
is to trade the markets for profi t, then cost averaging down is a very
bad way to go. Understand the differences and you will save yourself
a lot of grief, stress, and money.
We have heard the same stories over and over again from people
who think they are going to beat the market by buying more shares
of the same stock that hurt them. Only gamblers put themselves into
this sort of position, and we hope you will learn from the mistakes
made by others who continue to throw their good money after bad
trades. Figure 6.2 gives us a picture of what goes through the minds
of those who use cost averaging down as a trading strategy.
The Building Blocks of a Role Reversal Pattern
A role reversal occurs when a certain price level, once seen as a sup-
port on a price chart, is broken and then changes to an area of resist-
ance. This occurs in a similar way with areas of resistance that change
to support, but let ’s look at a typical role reversal pattern on the
downside fi rst.

==================================================

The Role Reversal 131
In Figure 6.3 you see a candlestick chart with a role reversal
identifi ed. In this example you will see that at point A the stock was
holding support around the $ 40 price range. Here, investors and
traders alike thought that the price of the stock had reached a point
of value. As a result, buyers came in and purchased shares, creating
enough demand to overtake supply. As a result of this new money
moving into the stock, the price moved up. This, as mentioned
before, identifi es an area of support. Keep in mind that the traders
who were getting in at this point do so with a goal to take short- term
profi ts on any price moves greater than $ 40. The stock rallied to
$ 75 per share in just a few weeks. This works out to be an 87 percent
price move. This return is good enough to force the swing traders
to take their profi ts, which is what we see shortly after the $ 75 level
is reached. This downturn is called p rofi t taking, and it’ s something
every trader should expect to see after a signifi cant price rally.
After the profi t - taking move, you can see that the stock traded
back down to the $ 60 level. Another rally to over $ 90 was followed
by a series of downturns that brought the stock right back down to
the $ 40 support at point B. Moving on in time, you can see that
after the stock had fallen below the support level of $ 40, it made one
fi nal attempt to rally before failing completely. After that, the stock
continued to bump its head against the newly established resistance
level.

132 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
The Psychology behind the Move
If you were to study the reasons why this price pattern occurs so often,
you would see that it is nothing more than large groups of people
reacting in a similar way with regard to how they manage risk. Fun-
damentalist who debate the validity of technical analysis will argue
that this is just self- fulfi lling prophecy where herd mentality drives
people to buy and sell at certain price points. The Market Guys have
a good answer for that: “ Who cares if it is self - fulfi lling prophecy?” If
we can make money because we have a good understanding of this
herd mentality, great! We are simply following the money trail. If we
notice that there are large groups of people getting out of a stock at
a certain point and we know that there is a good chance this stock is
going to hit resistance in the near future, then we just make sure we
are not buyers at these newly established resistance points.
To fully understand why the role reversal is so predictable, you
have to place yourself in the shoes of the person who has just bought
the stock at $ 41 when it fi rst bounced off of support but didn ’t take
a profi t when it traded up to $ 75. In fact, this may have happened
to you at one point in time where you bought a stock and it went up
right after you bought it. Imagine! A stock goes up right after you
buy it and, to your surprise, it continues to go up. How sweet it is
when this happens.
As we play out this scenario, we have to talk about a little driver
called g reed . This is the force behind why people don’ t take profi ts
when they should. If you have played out this story in real time, then
you know exactly what we are talking about here. Greed causes us
to hold on even when our brains are screaming, “ Take that profi t!
That ’s an 87 percent profi t in weeks! Take it!” However, there is
another side of your brain that is saying, “ Let ’s go for double or noth-
ing! ” Then the stock drops, and you are right back to the place you
fi rst bought it. Almost everyone we know has gone through this pain
when the stock proceeds to drop below the place you fi rst bought
it. What goes through your mind then? Of course, you start telling
yourself that it ’s okay. It will go up again.
From there, you can probably fi nish the rest of the story line.
What happens is that the stock doesn’ t go up right away, but instead
it tortures all of those people who are hanging on to their hope strat-
egy. This is the strategy where people hope that the stock will go back
up to the place where they fi rst bought it. All thoughts of profi ting

have vanished at this point, and people suddenly fi nd religion. This
is when traders all over the world start praying to the Market God:
“ Oh God, please get me out of this trade at breakeven and I promise
I will never again listen to my brother- in - law, who got me into this
stock in the fi rst place. Amen. ”
We hope you are saving your prayers for better things in life than
just to get out at breakeven, but the fact is that this is the story behind
why stocks fi nd resistance at the former support levels. People all
over are trying to get out at breakeven. The opposite occurs when
the resistance level is broken and then turns to support. In order to
explain this, you need to know what is going through the mind of a
short trader.
The Role Reversal from the Short Side
As a trader, shorting the market should be as comfortable for you
as taking a long position in the market. Short selling is a strategy that
is used when you think a stock is going to drop in price. You bor-
row shares from your broker and sell them in the open market.
Once you have sold these borrowed shares, you receive a cash credit
to your account, which will be used later to buy back the shares at
a lower price. If things work out as planned, and the stock moves
lower, you then buy back the shares and return the shares to the
original owner — in this case, your broker. What you are left with in
the end is a profi t equal to the difference between the sell price
and the buy price.
Following is an example of short selling:
1. T rader borrows 1,000 shares of XYZ stock from his broker.
2. T rader then sells 1,000 shares at $ 24 and receives a credit of
$ 24,000.
3. T he stock drops to $ 22 per share, at which time the trader buys
back 1,000 shares. This transaction costs the trader $ 22,000.
4. T he result is a profit of $ 2,000, less the commission charged
on both sides of the trade, along with a small amount charged
for margin interest for the loan of the shares.
This is an exciting and profi table strategy because many times
you will see stocks drop twice as fast as they go up. Of course, if the
stock moved up in price after you had sold the shares, you would still

have to repay the loan to your broker, which means you would have
to purchase those shares at a higher price. This would result in a loss,
so it ’s important that the short seller watch out for any upside risk.
The act of buying back shares that have been sold short is called
short covering. In order for short sellers to realize their profi ts, they
need to liquidate their positions by buying back the shares that were
sold. Short selling usually occurs when traders believe a stock has
reached an area of resistance and they think the stock will drop. If
the stock breaks above resistance instead of going lower, short sellers
are squeezed by day traders who generally buy into stocks that are
breaking out to the upside.
The combination of both the momentum buyers and short cov-
ering results in an explosive rally we call a s hort squeeze. After the
short squeeze has taken place, we usually see a drop in price. This is
when the short - term buyers, who originally put the squeeze on the
short sellers, begin to take their own profi ts. This new selling pres-
sure adds to the supply, and we see the price drop to the original
breakout point, hence the role reversal.
Figure 6 .4 shows the points that mark the formation of the role
reversal pattern to the upside. This is the sequence of events that
drives the role reversal pattern, and we challenge you to look for it
in every other chart you look at from now on. It’ s amazing how stocks
have a tendency to reverse at the newly established support level,
and many times the price will reverse within pennies of the original
breakout point.

Figure 6.5 Using a Line Chart to Identify Role Reversals
In our last two examples we used a candle chart to show you
the day - to - day price moves, but you can also use a line chart to
fi nd the reversal points. Many traders prefer the simplicity of the
line chart, and if this is your choice, then make sure you are using
a line chart that is tracking the closing price and not the opening
price. Remember, we put more weight in the closing price for rea-
sons previously mentioned.
Figure 6 .5 is an example of how we would use the line chart to
identify role reversal points. You will be able to fi nd many stocks that
are in steady upward trends, so this price pattern is one that you can
use to fi nd entry and exit points for your long- term investments as
well. The short- term swing trader might use a daily chart going back
6 to 12 months, while longer - term investors would use a weekly chart
going back 2 to 5 years. Once you familiarize yourself with this price
pattern, you will fi nd that, over time, your eye will be able to quickly
pull it out of a chart with little effort.
In the chapters that follow, we will show you how to position your-
self correctly using this price pattern and, more importantly, how to
properly use the support line to minimize your risk in a trade.
More Traders Drawing the Lines
As time goes on, you will see more and more people talking about
role reversal patterns and their relevance to maximizing profi ts in
the market. Thanks to organizations like the Market Technicians

136 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
More people are talking about the charts today than ever before.
As a result of this, more institutions and brokers are teaching their
clients how to use the charts to minimize loss. There is a wave forming
that is only going to get bigger. People will continue to resist using
charts as a viable tool for selecting good investments, but eventually
the overwhelming majority of people will be at least looking at price
history to make a buy or sell decision. As the signals continue to be
taught, then those very same signals will become more reliable.
The Market Guys started talking about technical analysis with
some of the most popular brokers in the industry years ago. At fi rst,
we were met with heavy resistance, but when they eventually woke up
and smelled the coffee, they realized that this form of analysis was
helping their clients stay around longer. For the brokers, it became
more profi table because their clients were trading longer and not
losing as much money. For the traders, this newfound knowledge
was exciting and profi table, and it gave a big boost to their confi -
dence level. We expect the same to happen to you. Just give it time,
relax with it, and you will see results soon enough.

MANAGING MARKET STRESS
T
he alarm sounded at 6:45 AM with a staccato note that roused Alex
the Trader from his sleep (although, after a restless night of tossing
and turning, it may not have been so much “ sleep ” as a fi tful rest).
There wasn’ t anything in particular that was bothering Alex lately;
he just wasn’ t able to sleep through the night without waking and
thinking. Usually, his mind wandered to the previous day’ s trades or
some news that was coming out in the markets the following week.
After churning the thoughts in his head, he would drift back into a
hazy slumber, only to be jolted by the alarm mere m inutes later— or
so it seemed.
Alex roused himself and, in usual fashion, tried to shake off the
sluggishness as he went through his morning routine. His refl ection
in the mirror was another reminder that stress and weight gain were
taking its toll on his health. Shower, brush, dress, and walk to the offi ce
in the terrace room to fi re up the computers and scan the day’ s news.
Alex prided himself on his trading setup; no detail was overlooked in
giving himself every advantage in the markets. If Alex were to miss a
trade, it would not be for want of technology and i nformation.
The screens fl ashed to life as he loaded his trading software and
news feeds. The approaching market opening increased the rate of
fl ow of information by the minute. The colors, headlines, charts,
and indicators started painting a picture that would require Alex’ s
experience and clear thinking to fi lter into the trades that he would
execute today. This pretrading ritual consumed Alex ’s attention right

up to the fi rst trade, when the fi rst pang of hunger caught his atten-
tion through the noise of the day. It was too late now for a proper
breakfast, and besides, who has time for that? He knew that after the
fi rst hour settled down, he could break free for a quick snack before
the lunch doldrums hit the market.
Two trades and 90 minutes later, Alex saw that the market was
cooling, and he decided to not ignore his protesting stomach any
longer — especially since his second trade was such a bust. How in
the world could he have forgotten that the company was coming
out with an earnings announcement that morning? Alex reluctantly
acknowledged that he was becoming more forgetful with important
information. He made a quick dash to the pantry and grabbed the
last cherry cheese pastry. The microwaved cup of instant coffee with
two tablespoons of sugar completed his mid- morning snack. Though
Alex felt that familiar heaviness in his stomach, he did notice that his
hunger was satisfi ed, and yet he felt impatient as the markets refused
to break out of the late- morning trading range. He knew he was
looking for trades that probably weren ’t there, but at least he felt
alert — perhaps even jumpy. He blamed it on the coffee and the doc-
ile market. He decided not to sit and watch any longer, and he went
long the oil market. When in doubt, he reasoned that oils will rise
eventually with the uptrend that they ’ ve been riding.
Speaking of oil, Alex was disappointed that there wasn ’t any left
over deep - fried fi sh and chips from yesterday ’s dinner. It was clearly
the lunch slowdown now, so Alex decided to run out for a quick bite.
As he waited in line at the caf é , he scrolled through the news headlines
on his mobile phone. Even away from his offi ce, Alex made sure that
he kept the advantage on the markets. The one that caught his atten-
tion was the OPEC announcement; rising oil prices had prompted
an increase in daily production to help stabilize the m arkets. Alex
instantly knew what that news meant for his open position. He also
knew that his leisurely lunch had just become a fast grab. Moving to
the counter, he ordered the sausage roll (it was premade) and added
a bag of crackers and a 24 - ounce cola to the order.
Alex quickly returned to his offi ce, eating his lunch along the way.
As he looked at his position, he was surprised that it had dropped
by only a marginal amount, although it was still trending downward.
Experiencing an energy spike from his lunch break, he decided to
pull his stop and actively manage this position. If it hadn ’t collapsed
after the initial news, it would most likely rally later in the day.

By 1:30 in the afternoon Alex became increasingly drowsy, won-
dering what happened to his post - lunch energy surge. “ Snap out of
it, ” he said aloud as he prepared for some healthy trades. Running
back to the pantry, Alex grabbed a bag of pretzels, two cookies, and
a can of cola to increase his energy and mental focus. Unfortunately,
Alex received only a momentary burst of energy accompanied by an
anxious feeling. Slowly, Alex felt the drowsiness start to wash over
him again. “ It ’s not fun getting old! ” Alex groaned.
Several hours of staring at the screen as the market close
approached showed Alex that the downtrend in oil wasn’ t going to
reverse today. It was slow, but it was steady. The only problem was
that he was now so far out of the money that he couldn’ t close his
position. He chose to hold it overnight and wait for the morning
pop — or so he hoped. As he closed his trading offi ce for the day, he
knew he would be in a foul mood for the evening.
For dinner, Alex strolled out to his favorite Italian caf é . He wasn ’t
sure if he wanted the double cheese with sausage pizza or the pasta;
however, he was sure that he probably had another restless night
ahead. Later that evening, Alex tried to relax in front of the televi-
sion as he snacked on his favorite junk foods, potato chips and one
more can of cola.
Analyzing Alex
Let ’s revisit Alex’ s unfortunate trading day and look for some under-
lying health and diet issues that are sabotaging his ability to trade
more effectively.
Let ’s start at the beginning with Alex ’s restless night. The brain
needs sleep! Lack of sleep results in reduced productivity and in-
creased errors throughout the day. Also, Alex is constantly being
reminded by his refl ection in the mirror of his stress and weight
gain. What Alex is not aware of is the stress hormone called cortisol
that is released in the brain during stressful situations (fi ght - or - fl ight
response). This was an important chemical reaction in the brain
when early humans were attacked by wild animals or in times of war,
and the only choice was to fi ght for your life or run for your life.
However, we were never created to be in a constant state of cortisol
release. Cortisol is a powerful hormone that shuts down the immune
system, making us more susceptible to illness. An abundance of corti-
sol also slows the metabolism, inhibits the absorption of protein, and

140 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
promotes fat gain. But this is just the beginning of what ’s happening
inside of Alex.
By skipping breakfast, Alex’ s metabolism slows down even more
as it tries to adapt to long periods without food. By consuming all
that sugar in the cherry cheese pastry and the coffee, Alex’ s insulin
level quickly skyrockets and remains high, driving the sugar into the
fat storage areas of his body. Within 20 minutes, Alex experiences an
energy surge followed by lethargy. This unhealthy cycle of not eat-
ing for long periods of time and then consuming high- calorie, high-
sugar foods promotes Alex’ s weight gain and prevents his ability to
think clearly and remember important details about key companies
or strategic trades.
Alex ’s premade sausage roll and cola lunch was high in saturated
fat and sugar, giving him a temporary energy surge followed by a
slump and more drowsiness. Alex tried to bring himself out of his
mental fog by eating a bag of pretzels, cookies, and more cola. The
afternoon snack gave another boost in energy, but lethargy set in,
creating another food coma.
Alex ’s double cheese and meat pizza dinner was over 1,600
calories of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates, creating an
environment of fat gain, clouded thinking, sleeplessness, and, even-
tually, even depression. Alex concluded his evening with chips and
another can of cola, which packed on more empty calories and fat
gain. This cycle assures no energy and promotes high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, heart disease, cancer, obesity, fatigue, and
premature aging.
Alex ’s Action Plan
What should Alex do to reverse this destructive direction? Here
are fi ve highly effective action tips to get back on the road to high
performance:
1. C lean out the kitchen. Remove all the junk such as empty- calorie
snacks, cream- based sauces, processed or packaged foods,
and sugary drinks. Protect your home as a healthy oasis in a
toxic food environment. If you make it inconvenient to eat
junk food, you ’ ll have only one option — nutritious foods.
2. L imit or eliminate visits to fast- food restaurants. Pack a cooler with
bottled water, fruit, vegetables, tuna on whole- wheat bread,

Seventh-Inning Stretch 141
low -c arbohydrate protein bars, and other high -q uality food
items that are high in protein and nutrients. Also, take a
multivitamin with minerals every day.
3. D rink plenty of water. Our brain is 85 percent water, so it is
imperative to stay well hydrated. The most efficient way to
determine the minimum amount of water your body needs
is to drink a pproximately one ounce of water per kilogram
of body weight. If a person weighs 80 kilograms, or approxi-
mately 176 pounds, he should drink approximately 80 ounces
of water, or almost two and a half liters. Some benefits of
drinking water include:
(cid:127) Regulates body temperature.
(cid:127) Removes toxins and waste products.
(cid:127) Transports nutrients.
(cid:127) Maintains blood volume.
(cid:127) Protects against fatigue.
(cid:127) Curbs hunger pangs.
(cid:127) Every major system in our bodies begins to break down
when water is low.
(cid:127) Concentration and reaction time drop substantially with a
lack of water.
(cid:127) Soft drinks contribute zero nutrients or vitamins —o nly
calories and chemicals.
(cid:127) Water has zero calories, yet fills you up.
4. E xercise with free weights . A daily workout releases brain chemi-
cals, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, which boost
alertness. Regular exercise also raises levels of serotonin, a
nerve chemical that boosts mood. Daily exercise naturally
destresses the body by lowering blood levels of stress hor-
mones, including cortisol.
The rise in body temperature that results from a vigorous
workout has a tranquilizing effect on the body, much like a
soaking in a hot bath. Exercise is one of the best remedies for
depression, many times better than medications or counseling.
Physical exercise:
(cid:127) Arouses the body.
(cid:127) Sharpens the senses.
(cid:127) Increases blood flow to the muscles and brain.
(cid:127) Increases the transportation of oxygen and nutrients to the
tissues.

(cid:127) Speeds the removal of toxins and cellular debris.
(cid:127) Reduces overall stress of the body.
R esearch indicates that active people think more clearly,
concentrate better, remember more, and react more quickly
than sedentary people. Furthermore, research also shows that
individuals increase their memory and ability to multitask by
up to 20 percent after participating in an exercise program.
5. E at brain foods and do mental gymnastics . Research shows that
memory and cognitive skills are greatly enhanced with a diet
rich in antioxidants (vitamins B, C, and E and beta- carotene).
Also, consuming omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish will en-
hance the brain’ s ability to function. If you have an important
morning meeting, eat a high - protein breakfast to help raise
your serotonin levels, which produce hormones that make you
feel more alert. An example of a “ brain - empowering break-
fast ” would be five egg whites, salmon, berries, and at least
16 ounces of water.
Challenging your brain by learning new information stimu-
lates blood fl ow and strengthens the connections, or synapses,
between nerve cells in the brain. Memorizing data also encour-
ages the brain to work more effectively and may reduce age- related
memory loss.
Sweet Nothings — Literally!
If you were to take time to read most of the labels found on some
of the foods you were eating, you would be amazed to see just how
much sugar you are consuming each and every day. For instance,
a typical cola drink packaged in a 20- ounce container has in it
28 grams of sugars, which converts to seven full teaspoons! So- called
“ healthy ” grain cereals might also surprise you when you check the
ingredients on the side of the box. One very popular cereal brand
identifi ed by a Special Big Red letter in the alphabet (hint: the 11th
letter) showed 11 grams of sugar for a serving size of 3⁄ cup. What
4
is interesting is that most cereal boxes will state that a typical serv-
ing size is about 1 cup or 28 grams. Now when was the last time
you sat down and consumed 3⁄ cup of anything? Just for the heck
4
of it, pour what you would estimate to be an average bowl of cereal

that you would normally eat then take the contents out of the bowl
and measure it. Now you will see exactly how many servings you are
really eating each morning. Chances are by the time you get fi nished
fi lling your cereal bowl, it will measure out at least one and a half
cups. This means the Special “ health ” cereal you are eating delivers a
whopping 22 grams, or 5 teaspoons, of sugar into your bloodstream
each morning.
Take time out to document your daily intake of sugar in the
foods you eat, then think about how many “ Alex ” moments you run
through during your trading day. Table 7.1 shows some of the things
most people eat along with the sugar content for each serving.
In this chapter we have focused on diet and exercise for several
reasons. Not only will this help you relieve stress, but these ideas will
also help you live a more healthy and fruitful life. Think about it:
What good would it do you if, for your whole life, you worked hard
and traded the markets for profi t only to see those profi ts eaten up
with your having to fi ght an illness later on in life? Especially when
that illness could have been avoided early on by following some sim-
ple ideas about diet and exercise?
Many believe that there will one day be a cure for cancer, and
that day can not come soon enough, but until then many medical
experts feel that preventative medicine is the best way to head off
this disease. In fact, a report put out by the Wellness Directory of
Minnesota, entitled “ Cancer Loves Sugar, ” states that cancer metab-
olizes through the process of fermentation. Now, if you have ever
tried to make your own wine, you will know that in order for fer-
mentation to take place, you need to have sugar in the mix. In fact,

Dr. Otto Warburg discovered years ago that cancerous cells can live
and develop, even in the absence of oxygen:
Cancer has only one prime cause. It is the replacement of normal
oxygen respiration of the body’ s cells by an anaerobic [i.e., o xygen -
deficient] cell respiration. (Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner
in physiology/medicine, 1931)
So what else does Warburg ’s discovery tell us? It tells us that
cancer metabolizes much differently than normal cells. Normal cells
need oxygen; cancer cells despise oxygen. In fact, oxygen therapy
is a favorite among many clinics around the world. So how can you
improve on your health, relieve stress, and cut down on your risks of
getting cancer? The answer is: Force oxygen into your bloodstream
through aerobic exercise.
Now, we ’ re not suddenly professing an extraordinary expertise
in diet and nutrition. But in the same way that we read the markets
and look for patterns and signals for our trading, we are also observ-
ers of behavior as it relates to diet, nutrition, and exercise. And our
observations, coupled with some basic research available to anyone
interested, tell us that there’ s more to success in the markets than
just fi nding the right entry point for your stock. Hopefully, that great
trade is just one part of an overall successful lifestyle.
Trading Fingers of Steel
We would be leaving out half the formula if we concentrated on
diet alone. We need exercise to stay healthy, and our brains need an
invigorating blood fl ow to stay alert.
Oxygen - enriched blood fl owing through your veins is good for
you. Your body is a lot more effi cient than you may imagine, and
it continues to become more effi cient as you change your diet and
exercise routines. For example, let’ s say that you were thinking about
going on a starvation diet, which is nothing more than stopping
your caloric intake for long periods of time in order to lose weight.
Under this stress, your body would react in a way that protects you
from starvation. In other words, your body senses that food in not
being digested, so what it does is slow down your metabolic rate (the
rate at which your body expends energy). On top of that, your body
will also become more effi cient at storing fat. Why is that? Well, it ’s
cc0077..iinndddd 114444 1111//22//0077 1122::2200::5544 PPMM



==================================================

==================================================

Seventh-Inning Stretch 145
because your body doesn ’t want to die, and if you continued on with
a starvation diet long enough, you would die. Your body needs food
to survive, so while you may feel good about losing those unwanted
pounds, you have in a sense trained your body to get better at storing
fat. You will fi nd that the next time you eat a meal, you will store even
more fat than you did before you went on your diet. You may have
met people who have gone through this experience where you’ ll
see them take off amazing amounts of fat in a short period of time
only to see them a year later heavier then they’ ve ever been before.
Chances are those people have only been dieting and not changing
their lifestyles with regard to exercise.
If you are someone who is sitting in front of a computer all day
trading the markets and eating like Alex the trader, chances are you
are on the road to disaster. Instead, try little things that can help
jump - start your exercise program. Make small changes that would
not interfere with your trading or the way you conduct your b usiness.
For instance, try standing up the next time you pick up the phone
instead of sitting down at your desk. Even if you were in a crowded
offi ce, this would not draw any unwanted attention to you. How about
this: If you are in an offi ce by yourself or at home, you can talk on the
phone while doing calf - ups. This is when you stand fl at on both feet
with your weight evenly distributed and rock back and forth from
your heels to your toes. Stand as tall as you can on your toes while
you lift your heels off the ground. Try doing this a hundred times in
a row, and you will defi nitely feel the soreness in your muscles the
next day. I ’ m sure you have heard the old saying, “ No pain, no gain.”
There is truth in that saying.
When you work your muscles, you are causing tiny tears in the
muscle tissue. Your body then heals itself of these small tears and
rebuilds the muscle, and this is why you feel achy after you have
worked out. This is also known as “d elayed - onset muscle soreness” or
DOMS. As you repeat this process, the body becomes more effi cient
over time as you build muscle on top of muscle. As a result, your
body burns more calories while you are at rest, and you will have
increased your metabolism. Studies have shown that the majority
of all calories burned (about 70 to 80 percent) are burned at the
resting level. So imagine what a couple of hundred calf- ups can do
for you each day. No extra time needed — just start your activities the
next time the phone rings. If you are too embarrassed to do them
in your offi ce, then exercise while you are brushing your teeth.

having to even step one foot in the gym.
Small Steps, Big Changes
Most people wish they could do better when it comes to diet, nutri-
tion, and exercise. If you fi nd yourself in that majority, don ’t lose
hope. We want to encourage you to make the changes necessary to
enjoy the fruits of your labors and share them with your friends and
family for many years. You don ’t have to make radical changes to
enjoy radical benefi ts. Think about applying your own variation of
the 1% Rule (discussed in Chapter 1 2 ) to your lifestyle. Reduce your
sugar intake by 1 percent each month. Increase your exercise time
by 1 percent each week. Add 1 percent more to your water intake
each week. You see how the small changes will add up over time?

Chatter Box — Rick
Many key points and information contained within this chapter were
provided by a good friend of The Market Guys, Dean Rosson. Dean is
a professional consultant who specializes in the areas of diet, nutrition,
and fi tness.
Dean tells the true story of a friend of his in Atlanta. This friend was
at the top of his game; he was tremendously successful in business and
seemed to possess the Midas touch. In fact, he was just c ompleting an
11,000 -s quare- foot addition to his home when he called Dean to men-
tion that he was having trouble catching his breath. Dean e ncouraged
him to visit his doctor as soon as possible. Dean’ s friend took a stress test
on the following Monday. The doctor called him later that afternoon
and told him that he was to check into the hospital at the fi rst oppor-
tunity the next morning. It turned out that Dean’ s friend had b etween
70 and 90 percent blockages in all arteries and could literally drop
dead at any moment. The man was only 40 years old.
Consider the situation. Here was a man with every success fi nan-
cially, but his lifestyle had him on a road to physical ruin. He was on
the verge of creating wealth that he would never enjoy. Dean ’ s friend
was given the opportunity to make changes in his diet and exercise
because of a warning shot fi red by his own body. Had he ignored that
warning, his family would be enjoying the fruits of his success without
him. We ’ re happy to say that this gentleman is still an active part of his
family and on the road to recovery.
Managing risk and performing at your highest level are not based
solely on how well you read the charts. Processing information and
taking action — the essence of trading— is highly dependent on how
well you take care of yourself. Don ’t neglect the trader while attend-
ing to the trading. You just might fi nd that your life improves along
with your profi ts!

in this situation at one time or another. You sit down at a restaurant
with a pretty good idea of the steak you plan to order and how you
wanted it prepared. But you open the menu to see 10 pages of eve-
rything, from salads to sandwiches to steaks to pastas. After a few
minutes, you’ re considering the shrimp scampi or the bleu cheese–
encrusted fi let. By the time the server comes for your o rder, you’ re
in a turmoil trying to fi gure out which meal to order that won’ t
leave you regretting your choice. Inevitably, the meal that a rrives
for the person seated next to you looks even better than your own
selection, and your dining experience has dropped a couple of
notches. There’ s some age - old wisdom in Henry Ford’ s reputed

comment regarding the Model T when he said, “ The customer
can have any color he wants so long as it’ s black. ” Ford ’s approach
may have been self - serving, as he was establishing the effi ciency of
assembly - line production. However, with only one color from which
to choose, thousands of hours in the showroom agonizing over vari-
ous hues were doubtless avoided.
“ The presumption is, self- determination is a good thing and
choice is essential to self - determination, ” writes Barry Schwartz,
author of The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less (New York: Harper
Perennial, 2005). “ But there’ s a point where all of this choice starts
to be not only unproductive, but counterproductive— a source of
pain, regret, worry about missed opportunities and unrealistically
high expectations. ”

I ’ ve been known to frequent coffee shops on occasion to work on my
laptop while enjoying a fresh cup of brew. AJ believes that I actually
have a dark roast dependency. He supports this hypothesis by tak-
ing long call positions in Starbucks (ticker symbol: SBUX) when I have
a lot of computer work ahead of me. In any event, I never cease to
be amazed at the level of choices that one faces at the coffee shop
counter. It reminds me of Tom Hanks’ s line from Y ou ’ ve Got Mail: “T he
whole purpose of places like Starbucks is for people with no decision-
making ability whatsoever to make six decisions just to buy one cup
of coffee. ”
Starbucks acknowledges their myriad menu choices on their own
web site with an interactive tutorial on how to order a cup of coffee!
First, you can customize your drink with an add shot. Before you think
you ’ re facing a simple binary decision, consider that the shots are
single, double, triple, quad, decaf, half decaf, or ristretto. According
to the tutorial, the last option is a short pull of espresso, capturing only
the sweetest part— as if to imply that the gallon of bitterness residing in
a shot glass is only the result of the last few drops from the press. Next,
you select your syrup additive. Here, you pick from two sugar- free
varieties and nine straight blasts of fl avored high - fructose corn syrup.
The third step requires that you make your milk selection. There are
six options in the milk category, including one that has been through
the entire production process without ever even having seen a
cow. Finally, you walk through a menu known as “ Custom Options ”

where you can specify everything from the temperature to “ wet ” or
“ dry. ” I suppose the baristas receive some type of training on how to
resuscitate a fi rst- time customer who is reduced to a catatonic stare
when she’ s faced with such a complex decision as the queue builds
behind her.
Social psychologists Sheena Iyengar, PhD, a management pro-
fessor at Columbia University Business School, and Mark Lepper,
PhD, a psychology professor at Stanford University, were the fi rst
to empirically demonstrate the downside of too many choices. In a
paper in the J ournal of Personality and Social Psychology (Vol. 79, No. 6,
2000), the team showed that when shoppers are given the option of
choosing among smaller and larger assortments of jam, they show
more interest in the larger assortment. But when it comes time to
pick just one, they’ re 10 times more likely to make a purchase if they
choose among 6 rather than among 24 fl avors of jam. The shoppers
ostensibly wanted the larger assortment but responded more often
to the smaller assortment. The fact that there were more choices
in the latter situation actually proved to be demotivating when it
came time to take action.
It goes against our intuition to think we could have more diffi -
culty making a selection when there are four times as many o ptions
from which to pick. This very issue is addressed in T he Functions of
the Executive (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), one of the
few true and enduring management classics. Written by Chester I.
Barnard in 1938, the book holds this observation: “ Free will is l imited
also, it appears, because the power of choice is paralyzed in human
beings if the number of equal opportunities is large. This is an
induction from experience. For example, a man set adrift in a boat,
awaking in a fog in the open sea, free to go in any direction, would
be unable at once to choose a direction. Limitation of possibilities is
necessary to choice. ”
The markets are sometimes the worst offenders when it comes
to complicating our choices. At one time, we simply had to choose
from many thousands of stocks. Now we have derivatives to add to
the mix. As the world opens up, we can also choose from market
exchanges from around the world. We need a process to sort through
the choices and fi nd the trade that works for us.

It May Be a Small World but It ’s a Big Market
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has around 3,000 listed securi-
ties. The Nasdaq has approximately the same. Within North America
we can also add the American Stock Exchange (around 1,000) and
the Toronto Stock Exchange (around 1,800). On the international
scene there are numerous major exchanges, including the London
Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the Hong Kong
Exchange.
Each exchange has a major index that tracks the representative
performance of that exchange. In the United States, traders will read-
ily recognize the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or the Dow 30. This
is represented by the tradable exchange- traded fund (ETF) called
the Diamonds, named after the ticker symbol “ DIA. ” Table 8.1 shows
a small list of some other major indices and the exchanges that they
represent.
Up to this time, we ’ ve talked only about equity issues. The next
level beyond the equity is the option. The option has three addi-
tional parameters that must be considered before you decide what
you want to trade: the strike price, the expiration, and which con-
tract (call or put). Just to give you an idea of how the multiplying
factor comes into play, let’ s look at the Nasdaq 100 tracking stock,
the QQQQ. If we decide to trade the ETF directly, we can buy or
sell the QQQQ. However, if we choose to trade the QQQQ option,
we must fi rst decide between a call and a put. Next, we choose
the expiration month. At the time of this writing, the QQQQ has
seven different expiration months, including the long - term equity
anticipation security (LEAPS). As far as the strike price goes, we have

seven different price levels to pick from, in one- dollar increments
above and below the current trade price. Taken altogether, we have a
(cid:1) (cid:1)
total of 98 (2 7 7) separate options from which to choose based
on a single equity issue. When you look at all of the stocks that trade
options (not all stocks have options traded), you can see that the
pool of trading possibilities increases exponentially.
By the way, we haven ’t even started talking about futures, which
may be traded on single stocks, indices, commodities, and more. Add
to that the various ETFs, mutual funds, currencies, CFDs (contracts
for difference), and multileg option spreads, and the task of decid-
ing what to trade starts looking like too many jars of jam.

I will admit that my strategy for going long Starbucks calls, just before
joining Rick at his favorite coffee shop for a cup of hot java, has been
profi table. However, there is nothing that beats the simplicity of order-
ing a double espresso (no sugar) and a bottle of San Pellegrino while
sitting in the lounge of the Steigenberger Belvedere Hotel in Davos,
Switzerland. The added bonus is that even at the top of one of the
most beautiful mountain ranges in the world, I ’ m still able to place a

Our objective in screening stocks is to reduce the total popula-
tion down to a reasonable pool from which we can select one or more
trade setups. Simplicity is the name of the game here. The screening
process, like the technical analysis process, will let you run down to
the most arcane detail without so much as a whimper of a protest.
You can create screens that, when applied to the total market, may
yield only two or three candidates that match your criteria. The fact
that you’ ve narrowed the pool down to a handful of survivors does
not in any fashion ensure that you’ ve identifi ed the perfect stock to
trade. It simply means you ’r e too picky.
In the same way that we advocate using the more robust and
simple tools for technical analysis, we also suggest that the simple
approach be applied to your screening methods. By nature, we tend

to lend credibility to a decision in the same proportion as the d egree
of diffi culty by which that decision was reached. When we don ’t
fully understand something and we’ re having it explained to us by
someone who, by all outward appearances, does understand it, we
abrogate our judgment for theirs. Similarly, many traders will stroll
through the carnival- like halls of a trading show and absorb the vari-
ous technical screens, analysis packages, and cycle analyzers. Even
though they may not fully understand what they’ re using, by virtue
of the fact that many other traders seemingly profi t from these tools,
they put them to work in their own trading room.
We’ ll take a walk through the four most common screens and,
hopefully, give you some ideas you ’ ve not considered. The follow-
ing paragraphs are not meant to be the complete and fi nal word,
though. We ’ re not sure it’ s possible to create a complete screening
list. For that matter, we ’ re not sure why anyone would attempt such
a task. We’ re looking to separate the wheat from the chaff; we’ re not
in search of the perfect grain of wheat.
Back to the Basics
The fi rst set of screening criteria that we’ ll examine is the basics.
These are simple measures of the stock or the company that don’ t
really fall into a technical or fundamental category, although some
might choose to categorize them a bit differently. Here’ s where it’ s
nice to be able to say, “ It doesn ’t really make any difference.” The cat-
egories that we ’ re using are for the purpose of organizing the crite-
ria and don ’t impact the fi nal outcome.

We’ ll walk through them in short detail so as to explain our rea-
son for including them in the list. As we provide the explanation,
our goal is to stimulate your thinking about what other criteria you
might use and, more importantly, why you would use it.

E Pluribus Unum 155
Price
The fi rst in the list is price. There’ s a reason that our lead- off batter
is price; it’ s the only criterion whose change will directly and imme-
diately impact your profi ts. With price, most traders will establish a
minimum price and sometimes a maximum as well. For example, the
price screen may specify that the stock price be at least $ 10 or $ 20
per share. The idea here is to eliminate the very low priced stocks.
The so - called penny stocks tend to attract speculators who may be
moving many thousands of shares. This often drives volatility, and
hard swings may occur out of the blue for no apparent reason. Also,
most institutions will avoid the very low priced stocks. Many of these
stocks are trading at very low levels after having fallen from much
higher prices, often due to news such as poor earnings.
It ’s easy to look at a very low priced stock and start dreaming
about the day that your $ 1 stock is trading at $ 50. We can almost
picture the profi ts that we ’ ll rake in when the grand rally is staged.
However, don ’t ever forget that the market tends to price a stock
according to all of the information that is fl oating around. If a
stock was trading at $ 40 last summer and is now at $ 1, it ’s most likely
because the fundamentals have deteriorated so badly that the stock
should be that low. Unfortunately, we’ ve all met someone who claims
to have purchased the stock that multiplied by a factor of 5, 10, 20,
or more. You may have even experienced that situation. We ’ re not
saying that it can ’t happen. We ’ re just pointing out that this is a
fl imsy foundation upon which to build your trading strategy. If you
want to carve out a few dollars for a speculative play, that’ s fi ne. But
please don ’t try to convince us that you have the regular insight into
the stocks that will serve as your surrogate lottery ticket.
Screening for the higher- priced stocks is usually done because of
a limitation in buying power rather than any indication of perceived
value. If a trader has $ 50,000 buying power, she can choose between
1,000 shares of a $ 50 stock or 400 shares of a $ 125 stock. Since most
traders think in terms of absolute dollar moves rather than percent-
age moves, a $ 1 advance in both stocks yields a 2 percent increase for
the former but only a 0.8 percent increase for the latter. Looking at it
another way, a $ 1 move for the 1,000 shares of a $ 50 stock will gener-
ate a $ 1,000 profi t. But since the $ 50,000 buys only 400 shares of the
$ 125 stock, the profi t drops to $ 400. Of course, it would be expected
that the absolute swings would be greater in the higher - priced stock.

Nevertheless, this is the reasoning behind an upper limit on the
stock price.
Exchange
The next criterion in our sample list for basic screens is the
exchange. Here, we’ re talking about choosing a stock based on where
it is traded. Older traders have a tendency to want to trade stocks
that are listed on the NYSE. We suspect that this is due to the fact that
the NYSE has an actual trading fl oor. It is possible to hop a fl ight to
New York, take a taxi to Wall Street, and walk into the NYSE building.
With a pass, you could actually look down onto the trading fl oor. The
Nasdaq, on the other hand, exists only in the realm of computer serv-
ers. There is no physical Nasdaq trading fl oor; the exchange is strictly
electronic. The NYSE is referred to as an auction market where two
traders will execute transactions between themselves after match-
ing one trader ’s bid to another trader ’s offer. The Nasdaq is a dealer
market where trades must run through a dealer, known as a mar-
ket maker. The specialists trading on the fl oor of the NYSE and the
Nasdaq market maker are both charged with maintaining a smooth
and orderly market, although their specifi c functions differ.
Speed of execution and spreads are two more considerations
when screening for a specifi c exchange. In the early days of elec-
tronic trading, most traders expected to get faster fi lls through the
fully electronic trading systems that the Nasdaq offered. The need
to run NYSE trades through the specialist created a latent delay that
day traders found unacceptable. At the time of this writing in 2007,
the Nasdaq still posted its order execution speed as approximately
twice as fast as the NYSE. The Nasdaq also posts the average effective
spread as a third lower than the NYSE. The effective spread m easures
the difference in price between what investors and traders actually
pay or receive for a stock versus the average buy or sell price. The
lower the effective spread, the better for the trader.
Also, there are differences in the listing requirements between
the two exchanges. Historically, the Nasdaq has been considered
more of a technology and growth market. Part of the reason for this
is the lower listing fees and listing requirements. Companies with
limited capital have been able to obtain and maintain a listing more
readily on the Nasdaq than on the NYSE. A company ’s ability to main-
tain an exchange listing is dependent upon such factors as minimum

bid price, market capitalization, and liquidity. The liquidity is based
on the fl oat — the number of shares that are available for trading by
the public as opposed to offi cers, directors, or controlling- interest
investors. The NYSE has more stringent requirements and has been
considered the home for the more mature, blue- chip fi rms and
industrials. These are the companies that were around before most
of today ’s traders were born. As such, there is a p erception of safety
that comes from trading companies with such a well - established
pedigree.
Sector or Industry
Screening for a specifi c market sector or industry is a common
practice for many traders. Very few traders actually raised their hand
as a child in primary school and proclaimed to the class that they were
going to grow up to trade the equity and option markets. Wide- eyed
blinks by fellow classmates and a mandatory trip down the hall to the
guidance counselor would surely follow such a pronouncement.
The reality is that most of us enter the world of trading after a stint
in one or more nontrading fi elds. These past career fi elds provide
an arena within which we’ re quite comfortable. As we m entioned in
Chapter 5 , many of our friends in Canada tend to gravitate toward the
mining and energy sector. Those are strong industries in C anada, and
many traders have spent years working with the mining and e nergy
companies. As long as you don ’t fall prey to Mistake 1 ( Marrying Your
Stock and Finding Trades that Aren ’t There), covered in Chapter 5 ,
there’ s nothing wrong with screening stocks for sectors and indus-
tries with which you are familiar.
Besides personal familiarity with a sector or industry, the fact
is that sectors and industries often move as a group. For example,
when crude oil prices are rising along with consumer and industrial
demand, it should follow that the companies within the energy sec-
tor should benefi t. Rising prices and rising demand can be expected
to translate into rising earnings. It ’s natural to expect that the stock
prices should rise to follow suit. A very profi table strategy in this sce-
nario is to screen for stocks within the energy sector and open long
positions in one or more. Alternatively, you could buy the energy
ETF and capture the move of the sector or industry as a whole with
a single trade. We can see two examples of key sector stocks moving

In Figure 8 .2 , we see an overlay comparison of the Biotech HOLDR
(ticker symbol: BBH) with a key biotech stock, Amgen (ticker sym-
bol: AMGN). In each case, the leading stocks move quite closely with
the overall sector. It becomes apparent why we want to screen for the
sector or industry when we ’ re trading a stock within that sector.
Market Capitalization
Next up on our basic list is the market capitalization, also referred
to simply as the market cap . Market cap is determined by multiply-
ing the total outstanding shares by the share price. It ’s easy to think
that the higher the share price, the larger the company. However,
cc0088..iinndddd 115588 1111//22//0077 1122::2255::1100 PPMM

==================================================

E Pluribus Unum 159
market cap is actually the better measure by which company size
is determined. To illustrate this, consider two companies. Company
A has 50 million shares outstanding with a per- share price of $ 25.
Company B has 30 million shares outstanding with a per - share price
of $ 40. It ’s tempting to look at Company B and conclude that it is
the stronger company, based on stock price. However, Company A
has a market cap of $ 1.25 billion, while Company B has a market cap
of $ 1.2 billion. Comparing market caps, Company A is the stronger
company, even though the Company B stock is 60 percent higher
than the Company A stock.
Companies are generally grouped in size by market cap. Mega- c ap
or giant - cap companies have market caps over $ 200 billion. These are
typically the bellwether companies or conglomerates that lead their
industry. Below that are the large- cap companies with market caps
from $ 10 billion to $ 200 billion. Many of the well - known blue - chip
companies fall into this category. Next in the list are the mid- caps with
market caps ranging from $ 2 billion to $ 10 billion. The mid - caps are
typically growth stocks that may not be industry leaders yet, but may
very well reach that stage as they grow. Below the mid- caps are the
small - caps with market caps between $ 300 million and $ 2 billion.
The small - caps are often young or emerging c ompanies. They contain
many companies with strong growth and appreciation potential but
also carry a higher risk due to their lack of a corporate track record.
Reaching even lower in valuation chain are the micro- caps with m arket
caps from $ 50 million to $ 300 million. Micro- caps represent the bal-
ance between risk and reward; the downside is often as likely as the
upside. What about the companies with market caps below $ 50 m illion?
They’ re too small to trade on an exchange, so their prices are posted
on a daily publication called the pink sheets. If you want to trade the
pink sheet stocks then just remember: caveat emptor.
Options Traded
Screening stocks based on whether the stock has options is another
approach. The primary reason that a trader would want to eliminate
stocks that don’ t have an associated option chain is that there is less
fl exibility in managing risk. The fi rst risk management step that most
traders learn to take is to place a sell stop order after buying a stock.
However, managing risk by purchasing a protective put is becom-
ing much more popular among traders. The reason is quite simple:
A sell stop order is subject to gaps or fast moves during p eriods of

high volatility. You can place a sell stop order at $ 48 for a stock that
you bought for $ 50 and fi nd that you sold it at $ 20 when the stock
collapsed overnight on bad news. However, if you were the proud
owner of a shiny new $ 45 put on that same stock, you could sell
the stock for $ 45 even if it dropped to a penny. For that reason,
many traders will screen for stocks that will allow them to manage
risk through the use of options.
Besides managing risk, fi nding stocks that trade options will
provide the opportunity to use a stock replacement strategy. A stock
replacement strategy using options entails identifying a stock- trading
candidate fi rst. Let ’s assume you fi nd a stock that is in a strong u ptrend.
Everything you see tells you that this is a stock you want to own. Of
course, you could buy the stock. The alternative is to purchase the
call option and effectively own the stock for a short time but with a
smaller cash outlay. This is referred to as a stock replacement strategy
and could multiply your returns since you pay less for the option than
you would for the underlying stock.
Recent IPO versus Established
Have you ever been to an amusement park and ridden the giant
roller coaster? Once you’ ve settled into your seat, the safety bar
comes across your lap and then you’ re launched up the long, grind-
ing climb. As you crest the top of the tracks, you hold up your hands
and yell as the bottom drops out of the car and you speed into the
curve. One minute you ’ re going up, the next you’ re dropping.
With that mental picture in mind, trading an IPO can be the
market ’s equivalent to the coaster ride. IPOs are stocks that have
no market history and, therefore, no price chart to analyze. They can
represent great opportunity and great risk at the same time. From
a technical standpoint, you can’ t really use the Market Guys’ Five
Points for Trading Success because there is no uptrend, support level,
or stop level that can be identifi ed. Does that mean you should not
trade IPOs? Not necessarily, but you need to understand the n ature
of an IPO. While not all IPOs behave like a four-year-old who just
downed a bag of Skittles, more than a few have the kind of volatility
that tests a trader ’s resolve. Take a look at the chart in Figure 8 .3 .
Xtent Inc. (ticker symbol: XTNT) started trading on February 1,
2007. Within two weeks, it went from a high of $ 17.24 to a low of
$ 13.75. As noted on the chart, one day’ s trading saw a range of $ 1.93.

Included in a Major Index
Finally, the last screen that we include on the basic list is whether
the stock is included on one of the major indices, such as the list
shown in Table 8 .1 (on page 152). If a stock is included in a major
index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, then every fund
and ETF that tracks the market based on that index must own the
stock. Almost every mutual fund family includes an index fund for
the major indices. If the stock price falls, you have the assurance
that the large institutional holders of that stock aren ’t going to start
selling out of their position. As long as the stock remains a compo-
nent of the index, these holders will continue to own the stock.
Another consideration for trading stocks that are included in a
major index is the fact that the index is intended to be representative
of the overall market or economy. As such, you wouldn’ t expect to
fi nd fundamentally weak companies whose future is in doubt. That
provides some measure of comfort for traders and investors who are
buying that stock. However, if the stock should be dropped from
the index, we ’ ll refer you back to the mental picture of the coaster
ride we created a few paragraphs ago.

Getting Technical
The technical criteria for screening stocks may include any of the
technical indicators that are used in technical analysis. The following
list will give you some ideas of how and why you might use t echnical
screens to pare down the stock pool:
(cid:127) Volume changes
(cid:127) High/low price
(cid:127) Moving average trends
(cid:127) Most active
(cid:127) Gainers and losers
(cid:127) Bollinger Bands
(cid:127) Stochastics
Volume Changes
Let ’s start the technical screening list with volume. Along with price,
we consider volume to be the other member of the dynamic duo. If
the trading police were to step up and tell us that we could have only
two items with which to trade, we would have to go with price and
volume. Take away either of the two of those and we ’ d be writing a
book about catering wedding parties. We just couldn ’t trade without
considering these two fi rst.
For traders, volume looks like little green and red bars spread
across the bottom of our charts. But consider the word in another
context. Surely, most of our readers have attended a favorite s porting
event such as the Olympics, a football game, or a college basketball
playoff. You have two opponents meeting on the fi eld of play, the
home team (we’ ll call them the Bulls) and the visitors (let’ s call them
the Bears). When the Bulls are sluggish and their play is sloppy, what
happens to the crowd? Initially, perhaps, they ’ ll voice their c ollective
displeasure at the Bulls’ performance. After a time, though, the
crowd will generally settle into a lull. Substandard play by the Bulls
will yield substandard support from the crowd. The result is that
the volume in the arena is reduced to a low hum. At some point
in the game, a couple of the players follow Rick to the concession
stand for a quad- shot espresso. Upon returning to the action, these
newly juiced players start playing with a new spark. They’ re advanc-
ing the ball down the court with an energy that the fans haven’ t seen
so far. Now the crowd becomes engaged and with each advance by
cc0088..iinndddd 116622 1111//22//0077 1122::2255::1111 PPMM

E Pluribus Unum 163
the Bulls, their voices crescendo until the arena is echoing with the
volume of their support.
Can you see how we pick up the analogy for trading? Those l ittle
volume bars at the bottom of the chart represent more than just
another line to analyzed. They give us an indication of how much
support there is out there for the price movement. If the traders
start advancing the price but the volume is very low, we have to be
careful because that tells us that others aren’ t joining in the action.
When volume spikes on the start of a price move, however, we can
assume that the crowd is jumping into the action. Liquidity, as meas-
ured by volume, is the trader’ s friend for two reasons. First, more
traders means faster fi lls. Second, increases in liquidity usually result
in lower spreads — the difference between the bid price and the ask
price. Faster fi lls and lower spreads actually serve to lower risk.
From a screening standpoint, there are two primary ways to use
volume as a screening tool. The fi rst is to set a minimum threshold
for the average daily volume. A common measure is the fi ve - day aver-
age daily trading volume. We could set the screen in such a way that
it fi lters out stocks whose fi ve - day average trading volume is below
500,000 shares. The only results that show up from this screen will be
stocks that have traded on average at least 500,000 shares over each
of the last fi ve trading days. One word of caution here: Be sure to
glance at the volume bars on your chart before you enter a trade that
has passed through this screen. It’ s possible to have a stock with this
trading history:
Day 1 20,000 shares
Day 2 10,000 shares
Day 3 2.6 million shares
Day 4 35,000 shares
Day 5 15,000 shares
This stock has a fi ve - day average trading volume of 536,000
shares. That’ s enough to allow it to pass the screen we just set up.
However, you can see that the average was skewed by a one - day spike
and the true average is closer to about 15,000 shares. A quick look at
the volume histogram will reveal any anomalies that need to be
accounted for before entering the trade.
The second way to employ a volume screen is to look for stocks
with an increase in trading volume. For example, we could set up a

164 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
screen that shows us all stocks that have a 10 - day average trading
volume at least 25 percent greater than the 90 - day average trading vol-
ume. In this case, we’ re looking for stocks where the fans in the arena
are getting louder than they’ ve been recently. If we’ re walking past
10 different arenas, we’ re trying to fi nd the one with the most energy
so that we can join in on that game. This screen will show us stocks
that are increasing in volume and, therefore, are attracting more par-
ticipation from the market. Remember, for the trader, volume drives
price movement and helps to lower risk through higher liquidity.
High/Low Price
Next on our technical list is the high/low screener. This is a simple
but powerful tool that streams a list of stocks making new highs and
stocks making new lows. Figure 8.4 shows an example of a high/
low screening tool. On the left is the list of stocks making new lows.

E Pluribus Unum 165
The fi rst column is the stock ticker symbol. The second column shows
the trade price that generated the new low, and the third column is a
running count of how many times during the day the stock has posted
a new low. You can see at the top of the list that Sherwin Williams
(ticker symbol: SHW) posted a trade price of $ 42.10, which was the
37th new low for that trading day. On the right side of the screener
is the list of stocks making new highs for the day. Notice the listing
for Iron Mountain Inc. (ticker symbol: IRM) about halfway down the
list. That stock has a highlight across the entire line, indicating that
the trade price is not only a daily high but also a 52- week high. When
it posted a trade price of $ 43.21, that was the 133rd new high for the
day as well as the highest trade price in the last 52 weeks.
The reason for screening for stocks that are making new highs
and new lows is that we want to put our money where the money is
fl owing. Stocks make new highs when traders and investors are buy-
ing them. We want to buy stocks that are going up, and a great way
to fi nd stocks that are going up is to look for the new highs. On the
fl ip side, when traders and investors are selling stocks, the prices will
make new lows. We also want to sell stocks when the money is fl owing
out of them, and a great way to fi nd falling stocks is to look for new
lows. It ’s no more complicated than that. Like we’ ve said many times,
trading isn ’t easy, but it isn ’t complicated either. It ’s an ordinary
endeavor that requires extraordinary discipline.
Moving Average Trends
We’ ve included screening for moving average trends on the list
because it is a clean and simple way to identify an uptrend. Our
favorite way to apply this screen is threefold:
1. P rice is above the 20 - day simple moving average (SMA).
2. 2 0 - day SMA is above the 50 - day SMA.
3. 2 0 - day SMA and 50 - day SMA are both trending up.
Clearly, you can adjust the period on the moving averages and
create a screen that has different sensitivities. Using the 20- day
and 50- day SMAs compares the short- term trend to the intermediate -
term trend. You could just as easily use the 50 - day SMA and the 200 -d ay
SMA to compare the intermediate- term trend against the long- t erm
trend. Alternatively, you could use the exponential moving average

Figure 8.5 Price > 20 - day SMA > 50 - day SMA
(EMA) rather than the SMA. These adjustments are more a matter of
personal preference than a correct versus incorrect application. The
idea here is that we want to use a simple technical screen to generate
stock candidates that are in an uptrend. When the price is trading
above the moving averages, the moving average will act as support.
The short - term moving average will only run above the intermediate -
term moving average when the stock is accelerating in the uptrend.
The picture that we see in Figure 8 .5 is exactly what we ’ re looking for
with this screen.
Most Active
The next two on the technical list are included to give you an idea
of how to fi nd stocks that others are trading. These stocks are not
necessarily the best candidates in terms of the technical or funda-
mental criteria. Rather, the idea here is to fi nd the stocks that are
attracting the most attention based on volume or price movement.
The most active stocks can usually be found on just about any r eport
that measures the performance of the market. Most actives are
generally reported by exchange, so we ’ ll see the NYSE Most A ctives,
the Nasdaq Most Actives, and so on. Be aware that a stock may hit the
most active list for any variety of reasons, good or bad. Making it to
the most active list does not always entail a signifi cant news event.
Many of the stocks on the most active list are the widely held large-
caps that almost every investor and institution trades as part of a

portfolio. Sometimes, though, a stock hits the most active list when
an earnings surprise is announced or there is pending litigation. In
these instances, you have to be very careful about the increased vola-
tility that comes with the increased volume. There’ s nothing wrong
with running the rapids — just watch out for the waterfalls.
Gainers and Losers
Looking at the top gainers and losers, in terms of both absolute and
percentage movement, is a good approach to generating trading can-
didates. When using this screen, it’ s important to know the exchange
or index from which these stocks originate. Figures 8 .6 and 8.7 both
show a list of the top gaining stocks. However, Figure 8.6 is gener-
ated from the American Stock Exchange (Amex), while Figure 8 .7
is drawn from the S & P 500. All but two of the Amex stocks trade
below $ 10 per share, while only one of the S& P 500 stocks is below
the $ 10 threshold. The cheaper the stock, the less price movement
is required to create a large percentage change. When you screen
from the S& P 500, you ’ re drawing from a pool of larger established
companies, whereas a screen from the entire Amex would include
many lower -p riced stocks.
Bollinger Bands
Finally, rounding out the technical screening list are two representa-
tive technical indicators: the Bollinger Bands and stochastics. We
really don’ t need to go into the details of these indicators beyond what
was covered in Chapter 4 . These indicators are included in this list to
show how any technical indicator may be used as a fi lter for screening.
We saw how the Bollinger Bands may sometimes be used as an indica-
tion of a reversal for stocks that are channeling within the bands. One
application of the Bollinger Bands as a screening tool is to look for
stocks that are within a certain distance of the bands. For example,
we could specify that we want stocks that are currently trading within
10 percent of the lower Bollinger Band. This will generate a list of
stocks that are close to the lower Bollinger Band, and we would then
scan the charts to see if the price is above or below the band. We elimi-
nate the stocks trading below the band and then search for stocks
that appear to be channeling within the bands. The ideal setup in
this e xample would be a stock that is approaching the lower Bollinger
Band and appears to be ready for a rally back into the channel.

Stochastics
In the same fashion, we noted that one application of the stochastic
oscillator is to identify overbought and oversold conditions. In gen-
eral, when a stock has a stochastic value below around 20 percent,
we would consider that stock to be oversold. If we look for the price
to correct in the direction of the stochastic, then this would be a

long candidate. To set up a screen using the stochastic, we could
fi lter for any stock with a fast stochastic (%K) value less than 20 per-
cent. Again, these values may all be adjusted to increase or decrease
the number of stocks that pass the fi lter. Obviously, the smaller the
stochastic number, the fewer the number of stocks that will pass
the screen.

Putting the Fun in Fundamentals
We know plenty of traders who will pass by this section because they
place all of their stock into the basic and technical criteria. They’ re
naturally suspicious of anything that gets reported by the accountants
and analysts. After the wild ride that many investors experienced with
such names as Enron, Lucent, and WorldCom, it would be tough to
blame them. There are probably just as many investors who will skip
the basic and technical sections, dismissing them as attempting to
read the market tea leaves. They ’ ll jump right to the fundamental list
as the holy grail of fi nding the stocks. We like to balance the two, use
the fundamentals to identify what to buy or sell, then apply the basic
and technical screens to identify when to buy or sell.
(cid:127) Earnings
(cid:127) Price - to - earnings ratio (P/E)
(cid:127) Price - to - book
(cid:127) Analysts ’ ratings
(cid:127) Revenue
(cid:127) Sales per employee
(cid:127) Ranking with sector or industry
Earnings
Our fundamental list starts with two criteria that go hand- in - hand.
The fi rst is earnings, and the second is the P/E. Earnings are simply
the profi t generated by the company ’s operations for a specifi c
reporting period, usually a fi scal quarter. The earnings are probably
the most watched and analyzed measure of a company ’s performance.
Part of the reason lies in the simplicity of the concept. We may be daz-
zled by some more arcane accounting metrics, but most of us can
appreciate the answer to this one question: Is the company m aking
money or losing money? During the gold- rush days of the 1990s ’ tech-
nology boom, many fast- growth companies were plowing every availa-
ble dollar into business expansion and capturing market share. These
companies were often given a free pass regarding their absence of
earnings. A new measure was brought in to replace earnings — eyeballs.
This was an attempt to justify losing money so long as the c ompany
was expanding into the marketplace. The problem was that eyeballs
don ’t make purchases. It was a strange twist to watch companies

explain that while they may be losing money, they’ re making it up in
volume. That is to say, they used to be a small company losing a l ittle
money, now they ’ re a big company losing a lot of money.
P/E and Price - to - Book
As a way to benchmark the earnings, it’ s common to divide the
per - share price of the stock by the per - share earnings. This yields a
price - to - earnings ratio, or P/E. Different industries have different
standards by which P/Es are evaluated. Technology companies, for
example, are expected to have higher P/Es than utility companies.
The stock price refl ects the expected growth of the company and the
industry that it represents. We mentioned a moment ago those com-
panies that don’ t have any earnings. How do we evaluate a company
if they don ’t have any “ E ” to “ P ” on? Again, creative accountants and
analysts will highlight alternative measures such as price - to - sales or
price - to - book. The book value of a company is the theoretical value
of the company if all company assets were liquidated. Presumably,
even zero- profi t, high - fl ying technology companies could hawk their
silk fi cus trees and cubical partitions on eBay.
Either of these measures may be used to screen for trade candi-
dates. Screening for earnings may be as straightforward as specify-
ing that earnings are greater than zero. That screen will fi lter out
any company that isn’ t reporting a profi t. With the P/E, it is more
common to determine the average P/E for the industry you’ re
interested in and then using that average as the benchmark. A quick
way to determine an industry average P/E is by looking at the ETF
for that industry. The ETF P/E will be the weighted average of the
constituent stocks within that ETF.
Analysts ’ Ratings
Moving down the list we have the analysts’ ratings. We ’ ll do our
dead - level best not to appear too jaundiced in discussing this
point, but we really have seen some egregious failures by analysts.
Recently, an analyst for a major Wall Street fi rm wrote an upbeat
report on a company that specializes in making mortgages to cash-
poor home buyers. The company, New Century Financial, had
lost half its market value in the previous month, trading around
$ 15 per share. The very next day, the company announced that

172 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
it would cease writing new loans and needed emergency funding
to survive. The stock collapsed to $ 3 per share and has since fi led
for bankruptcy protection. It makes you wonder if the analyst had
inadvertently written up the wrong company. You’ d be wondering
only until you dug a bit deeper and found that the Wall Street fi rm
reportedly had a long- standing relationship fi nancing New Century
Financial. The best advice we can give when it comes to reviewing
analyst recommendations is to see which analysts are completely
independent and which are tied to a banking or underwriting
division. A good example of the former is Standard & Poors, which
provides investment research, ratings, and risk assessments. S & P
assigns ratings to companies on a one- star to fi ve - star scale, with a
fi ve - star rating as the highest. It ’s quite easy to screen stocks based
on a minimum S & P star rating. How much value do we assign to
the latter? Modifying a saying from Rick ’s dad, “ An analyst ’s rating
and $ 3.50 will get you a cup of coffee. ”
Revenue, Sales per Employee, and Ranking
The last three on the list, revenues, sales per employee, and sector
or industry ranking, are all used primarily as comparative measures.
As we mentioned earlier, this list isn’ t all that you have to choose
from. Company strength, performance, and rankings are evaluated
in a variety of ways, and any of the evaluation criteria may be used
for a screen. As with the basic and technical screens, we would cau-
tion against applying too many criteria together and then assum-
ing that the fi nal list is worthy of your investment or trading dollars.
Your trading plan should detail the process by which you arrive at
your trading decision. Screening for stocks is a part of that process,
not the entire process in and of itself.
Buy the Rumor, Sell the News?
The fi nal screening list is included because of the ubiquity of the
phrase, “ Buy the rumor, sell the news.” The fact is, stock prices are very
susceptible to rumor and news. Sometimes they present traders with
opportunities; other times, it ’s best for the trader to step out of the
game until the news and speculation pass. Screening for news usually
requires scanning for keywords. For example, if you want to screen for
earnings news, you may use such keywords as e arnings, whisper number,
cc0088..iinndddd 117722 1111//22//0077 1122::2255::1144 PPMM

or beat the street . The following list of criteria highlights some of the
more common news items that bear further consideration:
(cid:127) Legal news
(cid:127) Added to or removed from index
(cid:127) Earnings hit or miss
(cid:127) Split announcement
(cid:127) Insider trading
(cid:127) Partnerships and alliances
(cid:127) New market expansion
Legal News
Legal news is always a price driver. Having an awareness of what’ s
going on with the company in question is crucial before you scan for
legal news. For example, you may be watching a company that has
been involved in a patent infringement battle. A useful screen would
be to look for keywords such as s ettlement or d amages . It pays to use
your judgment and experience here to decide on which keywords
are most likely to appear in a news report that would affect your
position. Drug and biotech companies are especially vulnerable to
legal news, especially when their product line is subject to approval
from a group like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These
companies can see their stock prices double or halve on an approval
or rejection announcement.
Added to or Removed from Index
When the news reaches traders that a stock will be added to a m ajor
index, the volume will invariably rise and the price will often b ecome
more volatile. When a stock is dropped from an index, volume will
again rise for a short time. This occurs because all of the index
funds that held that stock must now liquidate their position to main-
tain their tracking of the index. After all of the index positions are
sold, the volume in a dropped stock will start to dry up as traders
move away from the discarded stock.
Earnings Hit or Miss
We’ ve talked about earnings at various times throughout this chap-
ter. Earnings are one of those news events that draws in more rumor
and news traders than any other we ’ ve seen. Companies are expected

to give guidance to investors as the earnings announcement date
approaches. The reason for this is the age- old adage that Wall Street
hates surprises. In truth, Wall Street loves surprises as long as they’ re
not the ones getting surprised. Also, there is a whisper number that
is not the offi cial company earnings but rather a consensus among
analysts or individual investors regarding the earnings. The stock will
often trade in response to the whisper number and then adjust as
the offi cial earnings number is released. The funny thing about the
whisper number is that the plethora of blogs and market- reporting
sites makes for some creative whisper numbers. Add to that the fact
that the very venues that generate the whisper numbers also pro-
mote their use and you have to wonder why it’ s still even called the
“ whisper ” number. Who is left to whisper it to?
Split Announcement
A split announcement is something to watch out for when a stock
price reaches levels that the company deems is counterproductive
for investors. Interestingly, this can be too high or too low. In most
instances, a traditional stock split is announced when the per - share
stock price is so high that it discourages trading and investing by
smaller investors. A stock that is trading at $ 300 per share may go
through a three- for - one stock split. An investor with 100 shares at
$ 300 per share would end up with 300 shares at $ 100 per share after
the split. The total value of positions held and the company’ s total
market value remains the same. However, a stock split is taken by
the market as a sign that the company believes in the ability of the
stock to continue rising, so it draws in more buyers and often pushes
the price higher. Again, though, if there is speculation around a
stock split, it is not unusual to see the stock rally on the rumor, only
to sell off after the split is announced. This is a classic case of buy-
ing the rumor and selling the news. On the fl ip side, a stock that
has seen its price hammered to very low levels may go through a
reverse stock split. For example, a company may announce a one-
for - three reverse split for their stock if it’ s trading at $ 3 per share.
If you have 300 shares at $ 3 before the split, you’ ll have 100 shares
at $ 9 per share after the split. Companies will often announce a
reverse stock split when they believe that their stock price is too low
to attract investors and traders.

Insider Trading
Insider trading is a term that most investors have heard and usually associ-
ate with illegal conduct. While the illegal activity gets all the press, the
term actually includes both legal and illegal trading. The legal version
is when corporate insiders— offi cers, directors, and e mployees — buy
and sell stock in their own companies. When corporate insiders trade
in their own securities, they must report their trades to the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission. These trades are readily available to
anyone through a simple corporate fi nancial overview site. We tend
to pay more attention to insider buying rather than selling. Insid-
ers will often sell company stock in order to diversify their portfolio.
Corporate offi cers and others often r eceive a large portion of their
compensation in company stock. If they continue to accumulate
the company stock, they could very quickly fi nd themselves with a
high concentration of company stock in their portfolio. Even though
they may believe in the strength of their own company, prudence
requires that they sell large blocks of their own company stock in
order to spread their i nvestment risk. A stronger measure of insider
activity for us is when the insiders are buying. This is especially true

stock option grants. When insiders are willing to go to the same mar-

Partnerships and New Markets
Once again, we round out our list with a couple of miscellaneous
screening ideas that may be used for news scans. Events that could
move a stock price may include new partnerships or alliances, new
product announcements, or entering new countries or markets. The
key here is to have your fi nger on the pulse of the company and then
use keywords in your news search that may give you some clues about
upcoming events.

DON ’T JUMP IN TOO EARLY
H
elio Gracie was the youngest son of Gastao and Cesalina Gracie.
Helio was always a very physically frail child. He would run up a
fl ight of stairs and have fainting spells. For two years, he would sit
on the sidelines while his brother Carlos taught classes in a new
martial arts style he was developing. One day when he was 16 years
old, a s tudent showed up for class and Carlos was not around. Helio,
who had memorized all the moves and words of his older brother,
offered to start the class. When the class was over, Carlos showed up
very apologetic for his delay. The student didn ’t mind and, in fact,
requested that further lessons be given by Helio. Carlos agreed, and
Helio became an instructor.
He soon realized that some of the techniques he had memorized
from watching Carlos teach were not very easy for him to execute.
After all, he was only 140 pounds and not particularly strong. He
then started to adapt those moves to his frail body’ s abilities, improv-
ing the leverage in the execution of some of those techniques. He
drifted from the traditional jiu- jitsu his brothers had learned and
continued to refi ne the skillful use of his opponent’ s momentum.
From this beginning, Brazilian Gracie Jiu - Jitsu was born.
In 1951, Helio met Masahiko Kimura in a match watched by tens
of thousands. Kimura was considered the greatest judo fi ghter of all
time, and he also outweighed Helio by over 50 pounds. The match was
so imbalanced that Kimura announced prior to the fi ght that if Helio
could last three minutes in the ring, Helio should consider himself

the victor. Helio fought with masterful skill, using his opponent’ s
weight and momentum against him. The techniques he perfected in
Brazil served him well in that title bout. Helio lasted 13 minutes before
the fi ght was called when Kimura placed Helio in an arm lock. Helio
later admitted in a 1994 interview that he had in fact been choked
unconscious during the match but had revived and continued fi ght-
ing. This was the ultimate testimony to the power of leverage and
momentum over raw strength.
Jiu - Jitsu Trading— Knowing When to Tap
Maneuvering within the markets is not at all unlike the match we
described above. When we approach the market, we’ re the 140- pound
small guy going up against the much larger opponent. For that reason,
it ’s important that we move with the market and use it to our advantage
rather than fi ght a losing battle. If you try to buy a falling stock, you may
as well be pushing up against a 400- pound judo champion who is lying
across your chest. During the match with Kimura, Helio felt his oppo-
nent begin to launch his trademark shoulder throw. Helio knew there
was no way he could resist against such a large opponent, so he went
limp and fl owed with the throw, allowing him to continue the match.
When the stock you’ re trading sets up for a strong move against you,
it is fruitless— even reckless— to position yourself against the move.
Rather, you should prepare to move with the action.
Sometimes, despite all of your training and maneuvering, you
fi nd yourself in a position from which you can’ t recover. The smart
jiu - jitsu practitioner will tap out. Tapping out is just what it implies:
The fi ghter taps his opponent several times to indicate that he ’s con-
ceding the match. Tapping out stops the pain and injury and allows
you to fi ght another day. If you stubbornly refuse to tap out, the pain
and injury will continue and may cause enough damage to prevent
you from fi ghting again.
If you ever get the chance to watch a jiu-jitsu match, one of the
key differences between a novice fi ghter and an experienced prac-
titioner is the patience displayed by the more experienced fi ghter.
The novice will constantly squirm, scrap, and push as he tries to
reach in for an attack. He’ s so focused on making something hap-
pen that he misses opportunities as they present themselves. The
novice assumes that being in the ring means that you must always
be moving. More often than not, his careless aggression leaves him

exposed to the skillful counterattack of the veteran. You see, while
the novice is a whirlwind of activity, the veteran will patiently defend
against any attack until the right opportunity arises. You might even
say that he ’s managing risk until he ’s ready to advance. It’ s almost
boring at times to watch the veteran do nothing more than sit and
position himself. Having saved his resources, though, he is ready to
bring them to bear at any time against his opponent for the advan-
tage. The veteran knows that while activity may be entertaining, his
greatest profi t comes from watching his opponent and moving at
just the right time. Ultimately, he wins the match after having spent
less energy and resources.
Do you see the picture we’ re drawing? You cannot defeat the
market by scrapping and pushing against it. What you can do is move
with the market and use momentum and leverage to your advantage.
However, you will often fi nd yourself in a situation from which you
cannot recover. Your smartest move here is to tap out and protect
your principal for future trades. Close the position, limit your losses,
and look for the next opportunity to enter the ring.
Identifying the Pivot Point
The concept of the pivot point is about how we move with the mar-
ket. It is the early signal of what move the market is about to take,
and we fl ow with that move as it progresses. Notice here that we ’ re
not anticipating the move before it occurs. That will often leave us
struggling against the much larger opponent. Our goal is to recog-
nize the move as early as possible and apply our trading action in the
direction of the move. Simply put, when the stock begins to rally, we
identify the uptrend and buy with the buyers.
The pivot point takes the form of a “ V ” in an uptrend or an
inverse “ V ” in a downtrend. We use it in conjunction with the role
reversal we discussed in Chapter 6 . Figure 9 .1 illustrates the pivot
point from a role reversal in an uptrend. The fi rst part of the setup
occurs at the line marked by the “ R. ” This is the price level at which
the stock meets resistance. As is often the case, this level is tested
more than once, indicating the strength with which the sellers are
able to push the buyers back into a retreat. The curved line in the
chart is the 200- day simple moving average (SMA). This line will usu-
ally act as a strong resistance level when the stock is trading below
it. The stock rallies above the 200- day SMA at the point at which

==================================================

182 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
Figure 9.1 The Pivot Point in an Uptrend
it meets the role reversal line. In other words, the price level that
acted as resistance at “ R ” is the same price level where the stock ral-
lied through the 200- day SMA. This can be considered quite bullish
when two strong resistance levels are breached. A short- term rally
follows the break above resistance. Then the stock falls back and
creates the role reversal line by showing support at the “ S. ” It is here
that we’ re watching for the pivot point to form. We ’ ve included an
expanded view of the two distinct pivot points that formed above the
role reversal line. Notice how both assume the “ V ” shape as the stock
rises off the role reversal support level.
Even though we may anticipate the bounce off this support line,
we don ’t enter the trade on the left leg of the “ V.” Entering this
trade too early before the buyers complete the right leg of the “ V ” is
akin to the fi ghter who presses for the advantage against the weight
of a greater opponent. It is always possible that the move may yield
a favorable outcome, but the smarter fi ghter displays patience until
the opponent has begun to move in the desired direction. One
point to note in Figure 9 .1 is that the fi rst pivot point failed to rally
and led to the second pivot point. That’ s okay. You would protect
yourself with a stop sell order placed below the role reversal support
line. In this example, the role reversal support was not broken and
you would have remained in the trade for the subsequent rally.
The same type of scenario occurs in a downtrend. Once again,
in Figure 9 .2 , we start with identifying the role reversal line. In
this example, we must fi rst fi nd a price level that acts as support.

Going with the Flow 183
Figure 9.2 The Pivot Point in a Downtrend
This is highlighted by the three points marked with the letter “ S. ”
About three fourths of the way along the role reversal line, we see
this support level broken as the stock falls. Shortly after breaking
support, the stock rallies and is pushed back down from the same
price level as the previous support. This established the role reversal
line, and we now watch for the formation of a pivot point. We have
clearly marked the inverted “ V ” shape of the pivot point in this
example. Notice how the stock failed off the role reversal line and
then dropped to the 200- day SMA. It spent several days testing the
support of the 200- day SMA before fi nally dropping below. Once
it dropped below, the fall accelerated before fi nding a short- term
base. At the time of capturing this chart, it appears that another
clear pivot point has formed below the 200- day SMA. We’ ll return to
the writing of this chapter after we go enter our short trade.
Let ’s take a quick look at an example of what is more likely to
happen if we jump the gun and enter a trade without a pivot point.
Figure 9 .3 shows a stock that is in a steady uptrend. We are able to
strike a clean support line by connecting the lows in the uptrend.
The stock has a history of dropping right down to the support line
and obediently rising from there. If we look at a trend like this, it
would be easy to convince ourselves that we can be lax about our
requirement for waiting for the pivot point. After all, why leave
money on the table when we can buy this stock right at the support
line and grab the extra profi t? The reason is given to us at the right
side of the chart when the stock fails to form a pivot point after

reaching the support line. The long black candle shows us that the
stock gapped down below support, briefly made an attempt to
rise above the line, but then closed down heavily on high volume.
We would not have been in this trade if we followed the rule of buy-
ing only on up days after the pivot point has been established. The
last three candles before the big drop were all black candles, which
tells us that the sellers are clearly in control. Money is fl owing out of
this stock, and until we see evidence that money has started moving
back into the stock, we don’ t want to be buyers.
The Pineapple Principle
It ’s often been said that the way to make money in the stock market
is to buy low and sell high. The only problem with this approach is
that we get the picture in our minds that we need to be able to iden-
tify the lowest point on a trend and somehow manage to also pick
out the top of the trend. In all our years of working with traders
around the world, we ’ ve yet to identify the fi rst trader who can con-
sistently pick the bottoms and tops. That said, we’ d highly recom-
mend against your attempt to be the fi rst. A better slogan to adopt
when trading trends is this: “ Buy high and sell higher.” Do you see
how the picture changes in your mind? Now you’ re not condition-
ing yourself to buy against the downtrend in anticipation of fi nding
the lowest point on the chart. You are executing the point of this
chapter — namely, following the money trail.

==================================================

Going with the Flow 185
When you wait for the pivot point in your trading, you are not
going to be buying the low. The pivot point is formed when the low
has been left behind. Very likely, you won’ t be selling at the highest
point, either. That ’s fi ne to leave some money behind you and in
front of you. Your goal is to fi nd high - confi dence trades and move
in to take a bite out of the middle.
We want to encourage you to think about your trading like a
pineapple, and we ’ ll refer to this as the Pineapple Principle. (Our
cursory literature search failed to uncover any widespread use of this
term, so we ’ ll be happy to take credit for introducing this to the
fi nancial world. Our guess is that this credit won ’t be accompanied
by any signifi cant monetary reward.) The idea is simple, yet useful.
When you prepare a fresh pineapple, the fi rst two steps are:
1. C hoose a good pineapple.
2. R emove the top and bottom.
This is an appropriate analogy for the trader. The fi rst objective
is to choose a good trade, based on the criteria that we’ re outlining
in this book. You want to identify the trend and follow the money
trail. That’ s the good pineapple. Beyond that, though, is the idea
of cutting off the top and bottom of the pineapple. Even though
you ’ ve identifi ed a good trend, you don’ t attempt to eat the whole
thing. That is, don’ t waste your time looking for the top and bottom.
The best trading in a trend is when you can jump into an estab-
lished trend, ride it for a time for a profi t, and then jump off. The
trend may very well continue, but don ’t look back and lament the
fact that you’ re out of the trade. Congratulate yourself for following
your rules and making a profi table trade. According to the Pineap-
ple Principle, trying to profi t from the entire trend, however good
the trend may be, is a bit like trying to eat the entire pineapple. The
sweetest spot is in the middle.
Pivot Point Patterns
As you can see, the concept of the pivot point is not a diffi cult one.
Nor is it tough to recognize the pivot point when you see an example
before you. The one aspect of trading with the pivot point that is s ubject
to interpretation and causes the most questions for traders is exactly
when the pivot point is considered complete. In other words, how

much does the stock need to rally off the support level before you
can consider the right leg of the “ V ” to be established well enough to
say, “ Here is the entry point?”
The Market Guys like to have simple rules that take the guess-
work out of trading as much as possible. To that end, we’ ll spend
the following pages reviewing some of our favorite candlestick chart
patterns that we look for when we ’ re waiting for a pivot point to
form. The fi rst section contains bullish pivot point patterns. These
patterns occur in a long - term uptrend after the stock has had a brief
pullback. The second section contains bearish pivot point patterns.
On the fl ip side from the bullish patterns, these occur in an overall
downtrend after the stock has experienced a short - term rally.
Bullish Pivot Point Patterns
Multitudes of trading books and articles talk about various chart pat-
terns. Some are fairly simple, while others require a special decoder
ring to identify. The list that we have included is not comprehensive,
but it does represent some of the more reliable patterns and signals
for buyers.
• Bullish engulfing pattern
• Hammer
• Doji
• Piercing line
Bullish Engulfing Pattern
The bullish engulfi ng pattern is one of our favorites because it cre-
ates such as strong indication of the return of the buyers after a short
sell -o ff. This pattern does not require confi rmation; it’ s okay to enter
the trade on the day of the bullish engulfi ng candle without waiting
for a follow - up day to show that the uptrend is continuing. Here are
the key points of this pattern:
• The stock must be in a short- term downtrend within a longer
uptrend. Remember, we don’ t want to be buying stocks with
an overall bias toward the downside. This is just a pullback
within a larger positive run.
• The first day of the pattern is a down day, as evidenced by a red
or black candle. The black candle tells us that the short- term

Going with the Flow 187
downtrend is still controlled by the sellers, who are pushing
the stock to lower levels.
• The second day’ s candle should be green or white, indicating
that the buyers are in control for that day.
• Here’ s the key to the bullish engulfing pattern: The second
day’ s body must completely engulf the first day’ s body. The
open of the second day could be equal to the first day ’s close,
although ideally the second day ’s open is lower than the first
day ’s close. Likewise, while the second day ’s close may be equal
to the first day ’s open, it ’s better if the second day closes above
the previous open. Finally, while not required, it shows more
strength if the second day’ s body completely engulfs the first
day ’s body and shadows.
Figure 9 .4 illustrates the formation of a pivot point with a bullish
engulfi ng pattern. In this chart, we see that the prevailing trend is
upward. As the stock moves higher, it takes a short breather, noted
by the three black candles that drop to the role reversal support
line. We ’ ve expanded the bullish engulfi ng pattern to reveal how
the second day opened slightly below the fi rst day ’s close. The stock
then closed well above the high of the previous day. In fact, it closed
higher than the two previous days’ trading. When you see the stock
forming this pattern, it’ s acceptable to enter the trade in the last
10 to 15 minutes of the trading day. Alternatively, you could wait
until the next trading session to open your trade.

188 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
Hammer
The hammer pattern develops at the bottom of a downtrend when
the sellers continue their sell - off during the day but fail to hold it
by the close. The long shadow below the candle body tells us how
far the sellers took the price down before the buyers stepped in and
forced them into a retreat. The hammer pattern does require confi r-
mation. You need to wait until the day after the hammer pattern to
verify that the buyers are going to continue pushing the stock back
up. Also, the hammer pattern itself does not create a pivot point; it
creates the apex of the “ V.” The pivot point is formed by the confi r-
mation candle, which follows the hammer itself. Here are the key
points of the hammer pattern:
• The stock is in a short - term downtrend, as shown by a series of
lower highs and lower lows with black candle bodies.
• The hammer body is relatively small compared to previous
day ’s candle bodies. The color of the body is not critical for
the hammer.
• The lower shadow is at least 2 to 3 times as long as the body
length. We tend to be a little cautious if the lower shadow is
extremely long, however. For example, if the shadow is 10 times
as long as the body, that tells us that the sellers were able to
penetrate deeply into new low territory. We ’ d prefer to see a
moderate testing but not a heavy sell- off, even though the buy-
ers do push the price back up toward the end of the trading
session.
• The top shadow should be no longer than the length of the
candle body. It ’s also fine if there is no top shadow.
In Figure 9 .5 , we see an example of a hammer reversal during an
uptrend. We’ ve expanded the view on seven candles to highlight the
setup and then the hammer with confi rmation. The stock is clearly
in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. As the price crests
one of the higher highs, we see the slight pullback in the expanded
view. This is followed by the white hammer at point A in the large view.
Remember that the hammer pattern does require confi rmation, so
we won ’t consider the reversal complete until we see the white day
following the hammer. This tells us that the buyers are in control and
we can enter a long trade after the following days ’ trading.

Figure 9.5 Hammer Reversal Pattern
Doji
The doji is a single candle that represents indecision by the buy-
ers and sellers. The interpretation of a doji is highly dependent
on where it falls in relation to other types of candles. If a stock is
printing a series of doji candles, that indicates that there is general
indecision and it may not be resolved for quite some time. This is
especially true if the volume is low. Indecision on low volume simply
tells us that nobody is willing to commit to a direction and so the
price just fl oats along. That type of stock does not offer good trad-
ing opportunities. However, if a stock is in a strong fall on heavy
volume and then you see a doji immediately following a long black
candle, that would be a strong sign that the sellers have lost the
momentum. The doji always requires confi rmation, since it signi-
fi es indecision rather than a change of direction. We want to see a
confi rmation of a new direction before we jump into the trade. The
doji is very easy to identify:
• The open and close are the same price, or very nearly the same
price. This creates a horizontal line in place of the body.
• The shadows create various styles of doji. A simple doji has a
top and bottom shadow of approximately equal length. This
creates the doji cross. The gravestone doji has no bottom
shadow and a long top shadow. A dragonfly doji has no top
shadow and a long bottom shadow. The four- price doji occurs

190 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
in the unique situation when the open, close, high, and low
are all the same price. The four - price doji appears as simply a
small dash.
Figure 9 .6 is especially instructive because it gives us an example
of a failed doji as well as a successful doji. Both of the doji candles
appear within a short - term downtrend. Therefore, we would expect
that a reversal signal would show us when the stock starts to rally.
Doji 1 is noted on the chart as the fi rst doji candle in the downtrend.
Now, it would be tempting to look at doji 1 and reason that the stock
should rally here because the three days prior to doji 1 all found sup-
port at about the same price. Notice how the low of each of the three
previous days is approximately the same price as the low of doji 1.
This is where our rules come into play.
The doji requires confi rmation, so we wouldn ’t enter the long
trade even though there are other factors that may tempt us. Our
rules would have protected us from the long black candle that fol-
lowed doji 1. Next, we see doji 2 appear after the long black candle.
Follow the mind- set here: The stock had a support level that held
for several days. This support was broken and the sellers pushed the
price down and closed the stock very near the day’ s low. If the sell-
ers still had control and momentum, we would expect to see more
long black candles. Instead, we ’ re given a doji, which tells us that

Going with the Flow 191
the fall was short - lived. Following our rules, we wait until the day
after doji 2 before we enter the trade. The next day was a white day,
indicating that the buyers had stepped back in, and it is there that
we buy the stock. The second day after doji 2 might have rattled your
nerves since it was a black candle, but don’ t lose sight of the fact that
the stock still had a higher high and higher low. Doji 2 would have
yielded a $ 2 move in four days if you waited for the proper confi rma-
tion. Jumping in too early on doji 1 would most likely have stopped
you out at a loss.
Piercing Line
Many of the reversal patterns that we look at have a counterpart for the
opposite trend. The piercing line is a bullish reversal signal in a down-
trend; the same type of pattern yields the dark cloud pattern at the top
of an uptrend. The piercing line does not require confi rmation like
the doji and the hammer. Because the pattern itself is a strong show of
buyer momentum, a long trade may be entered as soon as the pattern
forms. The key points of the piercing line are as follows:
• The stock must be in an established short- term downtrend. A
series of long red or black candles leading into the piercing
line is especially strong. In any event, the day immediately pre-
ceding the piercing line must be a long black candle, indicat-
ing that the sellers are pushing the stock strongly downward.
• The piercing line is a green or white candle that opens below
the low of the previous day. Ideally, the opening price of the
piercing line candle will be below both the low and the close
of the previous day. In order to create this scenario, the stock
must gap down on the open of the piercing line day.
• The closing price of the piercing line candle must be between
the previous day’ s open and body midpoint. This shows that the
piercing line candle penetrates deeply into the previous day’ s
trading range but doesn’ t fully engulf the previous candle. If
the piercing line closed above the previous day’ s open, the
pattern would be the bullish engulfing candle. It is best if
the piercing line has little or no top shadow. We don’ t like to
see a piercing line with a long top shadow because that tells us
that the buyers were able to push the stock much higher but
were repelled by the sellers.

Figure 9.7 Piercing Line Reversal Pattern
Figure 9 .7 shows an uptrend with the higher lows connected.
Notice the long black candle as the stock pulls back to the trendline
support just before the piercing line. On the piercing line day, the
stock gapped down slightly, sold off to the trend line, and then ral-
lied to close well within the previous day ’s body. There is a very small
top shadow, which may very well have been some profi t taking at
the end of the day. A new long trade could be entered at the end of the
piercing line day or during the next trading session.
Bearish Pivot Point Patterns
As with buying patterns and signals, the selling patterns and signals are
many and varied. Our goal is to fi nd the signs that tell us that the sell-
ers are once again in control of the trading. When we see the selling
signals, we want to be sellers so as to put our money with the money
fl ow. You will notice that some of the bearish pivot point patterns are
simply the reverse of the bullish patterns.
• Bearish engulfing pattern
• Hanging man
• Shooting star
• Dark cloud
Bearish Engulfing Pattern
Like its bullish counterpart, the bearish engulfi ng pattern is a strong,
single - day indication of a reversal following a short - term uptrend.

==================================================

Going with the Flow 193
The pattern is best used within a longer- term downtrend, when the
stock is rallying toward resistance. The buyers push the stock higher
for a few days but the momentum is halted by the bearish engulfi ng
candle. We can recognize this pattern by following these points:
• The stock is in a short - term uptrend, characterized by green
or white candles. The candle that immediately precedes the
bearish engulfing candle must be a long white candle.
• The bearish engulfing candle must be a long black or red can-
dle. This is our sign that the sellers have the upper hand.
• The bearish engulfing day must gap up at the open, so that the
top of the bearish engulfing candle is above the previous day’ s
close. Ideally, the gap will be higher than the previous day ’s high,
so that the body engulfs the shadows as well as the previous body.
While this is preferred, it is not required. Finally, the bearish en-
gulfing candle must close below the previous day ’s open. Again,
if the bearish engulfing day closes below the previous low, that’ s a
bonus.
The fi rst point to observe in Figure 9 .8 is that both the trend line
and the 200 - day SMA (curved line) are trending down. Therefore,
the overall trend is negative. The stock rallied from $ 29 to $ 32 just
prior to the bearish engulfi ng day. This is the short- term uptrend
that we want to see within the longer downtrend. As the stock
reaches $ 32, it also bumps its head against the downtrend resistance

line. It is at this point that the bearish engulfi ng candle forms. The
stock gaps up above the previous day’ s close, which also happens to
be the high. The very small upper shadow tells us that the buyers
pushed the stock marginally higher before the sellers came in and
took control of the trading. While the bearish engulfi ng candle low
is slightly higher than the previous low, the close is below the previ-
ous open. As we can see, the black body fully engulfs the prior white
body. This pattern does not require confi rmation, so you could enter
a short trade at the close of the bearish engulfi ng day or during the
following trading session.
Hanging Man
We fi nd it a bit funny that although many of the candle patterns have
names that refl ect their Japanese origin (doji, harami, marabozu,
etc.), some of the patterns have less mystical origins. The hanging
man falls into the latter category. With a small head and long body
swinging from the top of an uptrend, the hanging man is a signal
that the bears may be entering the arena once again. The hanging
man defi nitely requires confi rmation. Although the sellers pushed
the stock lower during the trading day, the buyers stepped back in
and brought the closing price closer to the open. For this reason, the
hanging man signals indecision more than a reversal, so we need to
see the sellers before we enter a short trade. The main points to look
for with the hanging man are:
• The stock is in a short- term uptrend within a longer- term
downtrend. Remember, we want the reversal to return to the
prevailing trend.
• The body of the hanging man is relatively small compared
to recent candle bodies. The color of the body isn ’t critical,
although a red or black body does add strength to the sellers’
movements.
• The top shadow should be smaller than the body length. It’ s
also fine to have no top shadow at all. If there is no top shadow
and the body is black, that means that the stock opened on the
highest price of the day and only traded lower from there.
• The bottom shadow should be at least two to three times
the length of the body. Once again, we ’ re a little cautious
if the bottom shadow is extremely long. There ’ s not a hard

definition for “ extremely long” but, as U.S. Justice Potter S tewart
said in 1964, “ I know it when I see it. ” You, too, will d evelop the
ability to know it when you see it.
The hanging man in Figure 9 .9 occurs after a series of long white
candles. Even though the overall trend is downward, as seen by the
trend line connecting the lower highs, the stock is in a strong short -
term rally. At the point noted in the chart, the black - body hanging
man is formed. The hanging man appears right at the downtrend
resistance line; this is a good reversal sign. The next day is a doji, so
we don ’t actually get our confi rmation until the second day follow-
ing the hanging man. Here, we see a black candle dropping off the
resistance line and that tells us that we can enter a short trade.
Shooting Star
The shooting star has all of the characteristics of the hanging man,
except that the long shadow occurs at the top instead of the bottom.
We prefer the shooting star to the hanging man because it does a
better job of showing the shift toward the sellers. With the shooting
star, it is the buyers who make an attempt to continue the rally, but
the sellers step in and push the close toward the low of the trading
session. Most traders wait for confi rmation with the shooting star;
however, we don’ t mind entering a short trade on the shooting star if
it forms against a key resistance level. The main points related to the
shooting star are:

Figure 9.10 Shooting Star Reversal Pattern
• The stock must be in a short- term uptrend within a longer-
term downtrend.
• The body must be small relative to recent candle bodies. If the
body is black, that ’s an added bonus.
• The top shadow should be at least two to three times as long
as the body. With the shooting star, we ’ re not as concerned if
the top shadow is relatively long. This tells us that the sellers
pushed the stock down from much higher levels.
• The lower shadow should be nonexistent or at least less than the
body length.
Figure 9 .10 shows a classic shooting star pattern that formed
against the downtrend line. Pay attention to how closely the top
shadow ran up to the resistance line before the sellers started the
retreat in price. We would be willing to enter the short trade at
the open of the following day and use the resistance line to help us
set our buy stop protection. If the price should rally back up through
the downtrend resistance, it would be time to exit the trade.
Dark Cloud
The dark cloud is the counterpart to the bullish piercing line pat-
tern. Since the dark cloud penetrates deeply into the short - term
uptrend, this pattern typically does not require confi rmation.

Chatter Box—Rick
The dark cloud is one of the fi rst candlestick patterns that I learned to
use and, as such, I overused it. In fact, I had programmed my trad-
ing software to identify the dark cloud pattern and back-tested the
program to check its success. Sure enough, with the parameters I had
set, this pattern formation yielded a high return with minimal draw-
down. I was ready to battle the market. One of the fi rst short positions
I entered was on Dell Computer (ticker symbol: DELL) in the mid-1990s.
Do I need to remind any of you what technology stocks were doing in
the mid-1990s? My initial position quickly went out-of-the-money, so
I shorted more. By the end of the day, I had an open short position with
6,000 shares, and the average cost basis was $8 out of the money.
I went home that day with a $50,000 loss. The black dog visited me
that night and I had almost no sleep. I tossed and turned and won-
dered how much my dog would fetch at auction.
I returned to the trading fl oor the next morning before the open
and was met by grinning colleagues. It turned out that DELL was
indicating a strong gap down at the open. I sat down at my trading
terminal and watched the premarket activity. Just before the open-
ing bell, my $50,000 loss position had turned into a $30,000 profi t posi-
tion. As soon as the market opened, I started selling at the market in
1,000-share blocks. The stock was so volatile that by the time I closed
the entire position, I had made a net profi t of less than $2,000. I thought
surely there must be ways to make that kind of money without aging
10 years overnight.
The fatal fl aws in my trading then were numerous, but I learned
incredibly valuable lessons. First, I traded against the prevailing trend.
A dark cloud in a raging bull market is nothing more than a breather—
not an invitation to start short selling. Second, candlestick patterns
are not infallible. You may have your favorite patterns, but sooner or later
they will be completely wrong. That’s when you need to tap out! Third,
adding to a losing position just makes you a bigger loser. Don’t do it!
Let ’s look at the factors that make up the dark cloud reversal
pattern:
• The stock must be in a short- term uptrend within a longer-
term downtrend.

Figure 9.11 Dark Cloud Reversal Pattern
• The day before the dark cloud pattern must be a long white
or green candle. This shows us that the buyers have strong
momentum. It ’ s even better if the several days prior to the
dark cloud are long white candles.
• The dark cloud candle must gap up at the open. This gives
us a candle body where the opening price of the dark cloud
candle is higher than the previous day ’s close.
• The dark cloud’ s closing price must be above the previous day ’ s
open but below the previous day’ s midpoint. A small or nonex-
istent lower shadow just adds to the dark cloud ’s strength.
The dark cloud in Figure 9 .11 is evident at the resistance line
drawn on the chart. This is the same level from which the stock
dropped in mid- October on the left side of the chart. Here, we see
a short - term rally up to the resistance line. The stock gaps up on the
dark cloud day and falls to form a long black candle. From the dark
cloud to the subsequent low of the downtrend, the stock lost almost
50 percent of its value.

Essential Options, Part 1
KNOWING YOUR OPTIONS
E
ven with all of the books and seminars that are available today,
options remain one of the most misunderstood of all investment
strategies in the fi nancial world. Option trading can provide some of
the best ways to leverage your money to make a profi t without having
to increase the risk to your portfolio. With that said, you would think
everyone in the world would be an option trader. But the fact is that
a large majority of investors have never even placed a single option
trade. What is one of the reasons for this?
Fear.
Not only are options misunderstood, they are also the most
feared. Human nature tells us to fear the unknown and for good
reason. Imagine if we were to roam about the world without concern
for our own safety. This would be foolish. Any traveler knows that
you just don ’t enter into a foreign land without knowing where the
danger areas are. Roaming about in such a manner would eventually
get you into a dangerous situation. Therefore, it is a survival instinct,
to be, at the very least, cautious of our surroundings.
One of the other reasons many people shy away from options is
the misconception that they are extremely risky. As a result, those
who have incorrectly traded options are left with an experience that
was more like speculation or gambling. However, other investors feel
that options are safe and are a great way to hedge a portfolio against
risk similar to an insurance policy. This belief leads to a sense of
security, making those who have traded them successfully feel that

202 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
option strategies should be part of every investment portfolio. So
how can the same asset cause people to have such opposite opin-
ions? The reason is that options can be risky and speculative while at
the same time be secure and prudent. This all depends on how you
use them.
We see the same opinions in the credit markets. For those of you
who have teenagers in the family, you know that a credit card can be
a dangerous thing in the hands of a young adult who is unfamiliar
with the dangers of going into debt. If you were to give the aver-
age college student a credit card in their own name, there is a good
chance that student would run up the limit on that card within a
12 - month period. This excessive spending could even wind up with
that student ’s having to fi le bankruptcy to get out of this fi nan-
cial mess. On the other hand, you might have someone who just
uses a credit card to take care of emergencies in the event they are
traveling and run into a problem along the way. This person may
also be inclined to pay off the balance of the credit card each month
to ensure that the debt doesn ’t get out of hand.
When looking at this example, would you think credit cards are
good or bad? Just like options, the answer depends on how you plan
on using them. Back in the early 1970s, options were designed to
reduce risk. Traders would use option contracts to hedge existing
positions in a way that some people would use insurance policies.
This, of course, would mean that for every person looking to use
options to reduce risk there would be someone on the other side
of the transaction willing to assume that risk. Using insurance as an
example, you should already know that when you buy an insurance
policy from an insurance company, the insurer is the party who is
willing to assume the risk and you, the insured, in turn, pays that
insurance company a premium to take risk from you. What’ s really
interesting about options is that you may have one investor who may
be using options to offset risk in a conservative way while at the same
time you would have another investor who is speculating for profi t by
taking the other side of the trade. This relationship may be confus-
ing if you are not familiar with options, and this confusion is another
reason why many investors avoid trading options altogether.
It would be a mistake if you didn’ t make at least the smallest
attempt to learn about options. Therefore, we have dedicated this chap-
ter to the basic option concepts. In today ’s marketplace, options
are the fastest- growing asset class in the world, and as our economies

expand, you will see many more exchanges around the world offering
options to their investors. As a result of this growth, you will also see
many more trading opportunities open up, as new fi nancial products
come to the market. Options are by far the most important and pow-
erful investment tool available to you, and they allow you to pick and
choose the risks you decide to take or avoid. This is something that
cannot be done with any other fi nancial asset. Once you have fi nished
this chapter, you might still decide not to trade options, but we must
warn you that once you look beyond the basic ideas outlined in this
chapter, and into the more intermediate to advanced ways of trad-
ing these little beauties, you may wind up wondering why you haven’ t
been trading them already.
If this is the fi rst time you have ever looked at an option, then
understand you are in good hands. We are passionate about teach-
ing option concepts, and you have come to the right place. Clear
your mind, forget everything you have heard about them in the past,
and let ’s start at the very beginning. Chances are, if you have heard
about them through a friend or relative, you may have been misled
in the way options work. It’ s amazing to see how even some of the
skeptics have turned their way of thinking around after they have
been to one of our option seminars. Sometimes you just need an
idea or concept presented to you from a different angle for it to
be clear in your mind. We will do our best to take this topic, as we
usually do, in the famous Market Guy tradition of K eeping It Super
Simple . So, with that, let ’s get started.
What Is an Option?
There are two types of options: calls and puts. A c all option gives the
owner the right, not the obligation, to b uy stock at a specifi c price
over a given period of time. In other words, it gives you the right to
“ call ” stock away from another person. A p ut option , conversely, gives
the owner the right, not the obligation, to s ell stock at a specifi c price
through an expiration date. It gives you the right to “ put ” the stock
back to the owner. Options only convey rights to buy or sell stock. If
you own an option, you do not get any of the benefi ts that come
with stock, such as dividends or voting privileges. Options are simply
agreements between two people to buy and sell stock.
While options may sound like they would be used only by sophis-
ticated investors, they are quite easy to understand and actually quite

common in everyday life, although they are called by different names.
In fact, we’ re sure that everyone reading this has used a call or put
option at one time or another. If you still don’ t believe it, then just
keep on reading. We ’ re going to start with explaining calls fi rst, and
then we will move along to the puts.
Call Options or Pizza Coupons
By now, you are thinking that there is no way you have ever used any-
thing that would even resemble a call option, but think again:
A pizza coupon? Yes, this is actually just like a call option. Remem-
ber what we just said: A call gives the owner the right, not the obli-
gation, to buy stock at a specifi ed price. Well, isn ’t that what a pizza
coupon does for you? In this case, the pizza coupon gives the holder
the right to buy one large pizza. You wouldn’ t have an obligation
to buy the pizza. If you weren ’t hungry, you would just hold on to
the coupon for another day. When you fi nally do feel hungry, then,

Essential Options, Part 1 205
of course, you could walk into the restaurant and walk out with the
pizza, as long as you were still holding on to your pizza coupon.
To help you get a better grasp on what a call is, just remember
that the owner of a call has a right to call stock away from someone
and take possession. If you run into diffi culty later on when it ’s time
for you to actually trade a call, be sure to remember the pizza cou-
pon. Picture yourself making a “ call ” to your local pizza palace, then
imagine yourself walking into the restaurant to take possession of
the pizza. Finally, see yourself with a big smile on your face as the
new owner of this wonderful, delicious pizza.
Now let ’s take a look at how a seller of an option contract would
relate to the buyer of an option contract. Sellers of options don ’t
have a right to do anything. In fact, they have an obligation to make
a trade. The seller of call option has an obligation to deliver stock to
you. One example that we could use is that the seller of a call option
is like the pizza store owner who has an obligation to deliver a large
pizza with two toppings should you present him with your pizza cou-
pon. In other words, the pizza store owner is “ short ” the coupon and
has an obligation to sell you the pizza should you ask him to.
Now, in the real world, the seller of the option receives money
from the buyer of the option in exchange for accepting the obliga-
tion to deliver stock. This is not something that you would see with a
pizza coupon because there is no real value attached to the coupon.
Just remember that when you are selling an option, whether it is a
call or a put, you have an obligation to make a trade.
Chatter Box—AJ
Another real-life example of what a call might be is one that we
would see in the real estate market. If you have ever gone to con-
tract to buy a piece of property, you, the future owner, will pay the
seller of the property a sum of money to lock in a sale price. This legal
document that you sign is called a “contract,” and it simply binds two
parties to a sale that takes place at a specifi ed time in the future at an
agreed-upon price. In exchange for the money you have laid out for
the contract, the seller of this contract obligates himself to deliver you

the property on the closing date. This, too, is very similar to an option
contract. I’ve had the opportunity to actually work out deals with real
estate developers where I would buy an option on certain properties
with the intent to close on the sale of these properties many months
out in the future. These transactions have been some of my most prof-
itable investments in real estate, and it was my experience in stock
and commodity options that helped me to land those deals. So even
if you decide not to trade stock options, this information can help you
profi t in other areas of investing.
Now let’s get back to the pizza coupon in order to get a better
understanding of the terminology we use as option traders.
In this coupon example, we would say the u nderlying asset is a pizza.
Notice that we are limited to how many pizzas we can purchase; we
are not able to purchase all the pizza we want. For stocks, the under-
lying asset for a call or a put represents 100 shares. There are times
when the option contract would represent more than 100 shares for
adjusted options, but for now let’ s just stick with 100 shares in our
example. The value of an option, or the price we pay for the option,
is derived from the underlying asset. This is the reason why options
are considered to be one of many classes of d erivative instruments.
A derivative instrument is nothing more than a contract whose value
is derived from another asset, whether it be a stock, commodity, bond,
or currency.
If you take a look again at the coupon, you’ ll see that it includes
a purchase price for the pizza. The benefi t for you is that you have
locked in a price of $ 7.99. Even if the price of pizzas around the
world went up to $ 10, $ 15, $ 20, or more, you would still be able to
buy your two - topping pizza for $ 7.99. If this were a call option, this
stated price would be called the s trike price . The strike price is the
price at which the trade will be made should the option contract be
exercised. The strike price is also known at the e xercise price . The exer-
cise price is determined at the time the option contract is formed.
Also note that the coupon has on it an e xpiration date. You would be
able to use this coupon, or exercise it, at any time up until the expira-
tion date. After that, the coupon is worthless and no longer valid.
We hope this example simplifi es the idea behind call options for
you. Just like a call option, the coupon gives you the right to buy the

pizza, not an obligation to buy a specifi c amount of the underlying
asset for a fi xed price over a given period of time, which is the exact
defi nition of what a call option is. The main difference between a
real call option and a pizza coupon is that you will have to pay money
for a call option whereas you are given the coupon for free. The
price you pay for the option, whether it is a call or a put, is called
the premium .
All of this talk about pizza is making us hungry, but this coupon
gives us the right to buy only one pizza. In the stock market, call
options give the owner the right to buy a limited amount of stock. For
most options, that amount is equal to 100 shares of the underlying
stock. So, for instance, if you owned a call option on IBM, you would
have the right to buy 100 shares of IBM stock. An important thing to
remember is that option prices are quoted per share, so if you wanted
to calculate what the total cost of that option is to you, you would take
the option quote and multiply that by 100 shares, and that would give
you the amount of money you would have to lay out for the trade.
For instance, if you see that an option is priced at $ 2 (whether a call
(cid:1) (cid:2)
or a put), the total cost to you would be $ 2 100 shares $ 200 plus
commissions charged by your broker.
If you have ever looked at an option- trading screen, you have
noticed that there are different strike prices listed for each stock
that offers option contracts. This is the point at which most peo-
ple start to feel the “ pain in their brain ” because now there are
choices to make. Remember what we said at the beginning of this
chapter about people fearing the things they don’ t understand.
Well, if you are starting to feel your brain ache, don ’t worry, just
relax and re- read what we have covered so far until you get it. It
will absolutely be worth the time you spend learning this material
because the time you spend trading options could be the most
profi table. The reason options offer so many choices is that it
allows the option trader a wider selection of premiums from which
to pick. Calls and puts, combined with strike prices and premiums
as well as expiration dates — oh, so many choices to pick from. Just
take it one step at a time.
Five Points to Remember
1. O ptions trade in units called contracts.
2. E ach option contract controls 100 shares of stock.

3. T o determine the total cost of an option, multiply the option
quote by 100.
4. W hen you buy or sell an option, you are entering into a bind-
ing contract to buy or sell 100 shares of stock.
5. T he strike price defines the agreed- upon trade price for the
stock.
Options lock two parties to a particular trade, so what you are
actually entering into is a binding contract. While this may sound
like a tedious and time - consuming process, it ’s not. You can buy an
option contract just as quickly as you can buy 100 shares of stock.
Another point to remember about options is that they eventually
expire because each option carries with it an expiration date. Just like in
our pizza example, where you will see on the bottom of the coupon
a date of expiration, the options also expire.
Another beautiful thing about options is that the option trader
can choose from a variety of different expiration months, which
allows you to buy and sell option contracts anytime, right up until the
option expires. If, for example, you decide to buy a January option,
whether a call or a put, the last day you will be able to trade this
option will be on the third Friday of the expiration month that you
are trading. In this case, it is the third Friday in the month of Janu-
ary. Technically, the option expires on the following Saturday, giving
the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) a chance to match up all
of the buyers and the sellers, but you are most concerned about E xpi-
ration Friday . There is a misconception among traders who are new
to the option markets in that they believe that once they have bought
an option long or sold it short, they have to hold this position until
the option expires. That is not correct; in fact, if you buy an option
today, you can easily sell it on the same day.
This does not mean that we are encouraging you to day- trade
options, even though you could. We are making sure you understand
that the contract you get into is one that binds you to the other party
who is making the trade with you, and at anytime you can cancel that
contract by closing out of your option position.
A Sample Option Quote
In Figure 10.1 you will see an example of an option quote screen that
is also known as the option chain .

Essential Options, Part 1 209
Figure 10.1 IBM Option Chain
The call options are listed on the left, while the put options are
listed on the right. The column in the middle of the calls and puts
shows the strike price. This is the stated price per share in which IBM
stock may be purchased (for a call) or sold (for a put) by the option
holder upon exercise of the option contract. At the time these quotes
were taken, IBM shares were trading $ 94.22, and the fi rst strike price
seen at the top of the list on the call side is the January 08 $ 80 calls.
These are options that will expire on the third Friday in the month
of January 2008.
This option chain reads very much like a Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet. If you are reading this list from left to right, you will see that
the fi rst column shows the ticker symbol for each option in the
chain, which is what’ s used to identify the option contract the way
the ticker symbol would be used to identify the stock of a publicly
traded company. The second column on the left displays the total
volume traded in each option strike price for that particular day.
The next column is the price of the last or most recent trade, fol-
lowed by the bid and ask columns. Keep in mind that the bid column
displays the price that is posted by buyers who are attempting to buy
that particular option contract. So if you wanted to sell the January
80 calls at the market , then you would be selling to the buyer who
is posting their b id price under the bid column, which in this case is
17.10. If you were looking to buy the January $ 80 calls at the market,
you would have to buy those contracts at a price that’ s posted in the
ask column. The a sk price is the price where the sellers are willing to
sell their option contracts.
If you are looking at options for the fi rst time, it’ s important
that you follow along in this section by referencing the option chain
after each point is made to ensure that you are digesting this infor-
mation at a comfortable pace. Otherwise, the information may seem

overwhelming to you, and we don ’t want you to wind up in the
group of people who are not trading options because it makes their
brain ache.
Chatter Box—AJ
I’ve found that one of the best ways to learn options is to try and teach
it to someone who wants to learn how to trade them. Keep this chap-
ter open on your lap and make an attempt to describe these ideas
to your new student. Let your student know that you are just starting
out and you’ll need someone to work with. This method of “learning
by teaching” will make you a better student because your student will
ask questions, which forces you to fi nd the answer if you can’t come
up with one right away. If you do not know the correct answer, go
back to your book and look it up. This is a fun way to learn options.
Having a partner helps start a dialogue that keeps you learning.
Strike Prices
In our option chain you will see a column labeled “ Strike. ” At the top
of this column you will also see 80.00, which represents the agreed -
upon price at which IBM will be traded should the option be exer-
cised (Figure 1 0.2 ). It doesn’ t matter where IBM may be trading; the
owner of this call option or “ coupon ” is locked into an $ 80 purchase
price. Now this seems like a great deal since the stock is trading for
$ 94.22, and it appears that if you bought the $ 80 call, you would be
able to make an immediate profi t of $ 14.22 (stock price of $ 94.22
(cid:2)
minus the strike price of $ 80 $ 14.22); however, what is the cost of

the option? If you look at the ask column, you will see that the option
would cost you $ 17.30. The big difference between option contracts
and pizza coupons is that option contracts are not free.
Although you may be able to immediately make a profi t of
$ 14.22 as the owner of this call option, it will cost you $ 17.30 to
buy it. The $ 14.22 profi t built into the cost of this option is called
intrinsic value . The amount over and above the intrinsic value is
called t ime premium or t ime value . This is nothing more than the
added premium you would pay for the life of the contract over and
above the intrinsic value. The seller of this call option, who has an
obligation to sell you IBM at $ 80, collects this time premium from
you as soon as you buy the option contract from him. If we were
looking at the pizza coupon again, you could say that the time pre-
mium is equivalent to any delivery charges that might be added to
the cost of the pizza.
Lower Strike Calls Are More Expensive
Take a look at the $ 85 strike price, which is displayed just below the
$ 80 strike price, and you will see that the asking price for this option
is $ 13.20, which is $ 4 less than the $ 80 call. Why? Well, there are
many mathematical reasons why, but you now know enough about
options to be able to fi gure this one out. Imagine that you walked
into a pizza restaurant and found these two coupons lying on the
counter (Figure 1 0.3 ). Which one would you choose? Both coupons
offer the same pizza with the same expiration date at the bottom; the

Figure 10.4 Lower Strike Calls Cost More Than Higher Strike Price Calls
only difference is that the coupon on the left allows you to buy the
pizza for $ 3 less than the one on the right.
I ’ m sure you would select the coupon on the left because it has
more intrinsic value, and the same thing occurs in the option mar-
kets. Traders see the value in paying less money for the same number
of shares just like you saw value in picking up the coupon on the
left, so as a result of this added value, traders will pay more money
for this added value through an auction market. Look once again at
the option chain and you will see that lower price strike prices on the
call options are always priced higher than the higher strike prices
(Figure 10.4 ).
By now, you are probably asking yourself why option traders
would choose one call over another. Just remember that this chapter
is just glancing over some basic option concepts, and to get into
the core of option trading, we will have to write another book because
there is that much information to cover. However, wait a few more
pages and we will give you an outline of some of our favorite option
strategies.
Time Is Money
In Figure 10.5 you will see that the January 2009 calls are more
expensive than the January 2008 calls seen in Figure 1 0.4 . For exam-
ple, the January 09 $ 85 calls are offered at $ 17.90, while the January
08 $ 85 calls are offered at $ 13.20. Why do the January 09 calls cost
$ 4.70 more? Well, that ’s because the January 09 calls will expire a
year later, giving the options more time to grow and increase in
value. Since all of the other factors between these two options are the
same, option traders are only bidding up the value of the additional
time. However, why $ 4.70 more? One of the reasons has to do with
interest rates. Remember, you are controlling 100 shares of a $ 94

dollar stock for a fraction of the share price. So the cost to carry this
position is much less than if you were to buy the shares outright.
For example: Owning 100 shares of a $ 94 stock will cost you
$ 9,400 to carry this position for a year. Buying one call for $ 17.90 will
(cid:1) (cid:2)
cost you $ 1,790 ( $ 17.09 100 shares per option contract $ 1,790),
which is a difference of $ 7,610. This money could be used to control
more shares in another stock or could go to work in another option
position. The point here is that there’ s value in your being able to
control a stock such as IBM for a fraction of the cost. This, among
other variables, is why we see the difference in price from one option
month to the next.
If You Buy a Call, You Are Not Required to Buy the Stock
It ’s important for you to understand that if you buy call options, you
don ’t have to buy the stock or take delivery of the stock. You can buy
and sell options in the open market just like you would buy and sell
shares in the underlying stock. Even though owning the call allows you
to buy stock at a certain price, most traders never exercise this right.
According to the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE):
• Approximately 10 percent of options are exercised , which means the
buyers of these options decided to go ahead and take a stock
position by exercising their options (or using their coupon to
collect their pizza).
• Fifty to sixty percent of options positions are closed before expiration ,
which is what we are referring to when we say you don ’t have

214 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
to buy the stock if you own calls. You can trade out of them
before they expire.
• The remaining (approximately 30 to 40 percent) are held to expiry .
This group includes those who are holding options that expire
worthless.
Exercise versus Assign
If you decide to use your “ coupon, ” you must call up your broker and
submit instructions to exercise your options. This is a simple process
whereby you make a call to the institution that holds your trading
account and tell the representative that you would like to use your
call option to purchase stock. Throwing one more pizza analogy, it’ s
like your calling up the restaurant telling them that you would like
to have a pizza delivered and that you will be using your coupon.
Instead, you would say “ I would like to exercise my IBM January 80
call. ” Because the strike price is the price you pay if you exercise your
option, it is also referred to as the exercise price. So if you hear the
words s trike price or e xercise price they mean exactly the same thing.
Once you ’ ve submitted your exercise instructions, you will receive
100 shares of stock in your account three business days later. This
means that 100 shares of stock will be delivered for every call option
held in your account. When the stock is delivered, a buy transaction
will be entered, showing that you bought X number of shares at the
strike price. In other words, if you are exercising one January $ 80
call, you will see a debit of $ 8,000 in your account. This represents
1 contract times 100 shares times $ 80 (strike price), which equals
$ 8,000; at the same time, you will see 100 shares of IBM deposited to
your account.
Now that you know how the person who owns the call option gets
his shares of stock, you should know what happens to the person who
has sold the call option contract. Remember that the person who has
sold the option has the obligation to make the trade. In the case of
the call option, the seller, also known as the writer , is now obligated
to deliver the stock to your account. Once you have submitted your
exercise instructions to your broker, an assignment notice goes out
to the seller of the option. The short position holder or writer is said to
be a ssigned on the call. Just to repeat what has already been said, the
person who is long, or who owns the call, has a right to buy stock by
exercising the option. On the other side of that, the person who is

Essential Options, Part 1 215
short the call has not rights but an obligation to deliver the shares to
the owner of the option contract.
Intrinsic Value Plus Time Value Equals Total Premium
We discussed earlier in our IBM example about the immediate ben-
efi t of the January $ 80 call when the stock was trading $ 94.22. If you
were to exercise this call, you would have been able to immediately
take a profi t of $ 14.22. This profi t is known as i ntrinsic value . Another
way to describe an option contract that carries intrinsic value is to
say that this option is i n - the - money . In - the - money calls are options that
have strike prices below the price at which the stock is trading. In
Figure 10.6 you will see how the in - the - money options are listed on
our option chain.
If you look at any of the in- the - money options highlighted in
Figure 1 0.6 , you will see that the ask price for each of these options are
greater than the intrinsic value of each option. The January $ 80 call
has intrinsic value of $ 14.22 yet is it offered at $ 17.30, the January $ 85
call has intrinsic value of $ 9.22 while offered at $ 13.22, and, fi nally, the
January $ 90 call being in- the - money by $ 4.22 is offered at $ 9.50. This
is because each option carries with it a time component. If today were
options expiration day, the time value in each option would be zero
and the options would be trading very close to intrinsic value. Because
there is time left until expiration day, the options in our option chain
will refl ect this time value in the price of the option. If there is no
intrinsic value in the option and there is still time left before the
option expires, then the only value posted on the option screen will
be refl ecting time value alone. Options that have no intrinsic value are
defi ned as being o ut - of - the - money. In Figure 10.7 you will see examples
of calls that are showing premiums which only refl ect time value.

Figure 10.7 Out-of-the-Money Options Include Only Time Value in the
Premium
Time Premium Decays over Time
It is extremely important to know that this time value will decay on
every option contract each and every day as we approach expiration
day. There are some people who refuse to use options because of the
fact that an option ’s price deteriorates over time. If you are one of
those people, you are missing out on a very big piece of the equation.
Your car loses value over time, doesn’ t it? The computer you use to
trade with loses value. The fruits and vegetables that you eat deterio-
rate over time, too, yet these things still add value to your everyday
life. Once you understand how to use options properly with regard to
time decay, you will then see a whole new world of opportunity open
up for you. So it really doesn’ t make sense to say that it’ s not worth-
while to invest in a decaying asset. You just have to make sure you are
careful when you use them.
One of the biggest mistakes people make when fi rst trading
options is that they tend to buy the cheapest premiums on the board,
thinking these are the best value options. Well, if this is something
that you are considering, understand that these are the options that
have no intrinsic value and the price you pay for these options is pure
time value. Therefore, when you decide to buy such cheap options,
you should know that you can’ t hold on to these for very long; other-
wise, they will decay on you as quickly as a bunch of bananas sitting in
a fruit bowl. Put them to use or you will wind up throwing them in the
garbage. If you think about it, most assets that you buy depreciate over
time. If you have ever owned a business where you had to buy equip-
ment to run that business, you know that you have to get a return on
that investment that is greater than the rate of depreciation. This is
the same for options.

Essential Options, Part 1 217
Put Options
Now that we have covered some basic ideas of call options, we will
now be able to move on the other option contracts we call puts.
A p ut is a contract that gives the owner the right, but not an obliga-
tion, to sell a specifi ed amount of stock at a set price (strike price)
within a specifi ed time. The general public usually fi nds it more dif-
fi cult to understand the ideas behind put options, but, fortunately
for you, most of the principles you ’ ve learned about the calls also
hold true for puts. Things like strike price, expiration dates, and
time decay are all the same, with one exception— puts work in the
opposite direction. Maybe this is why the public is challenged in this
area. They have to force themselves to think backwards. So in order
to make this easier, let just say that put contracts are the insurance
policies for the stock market.
Puts work very much like automobile insurance. With an auto
policy, you pay a premium to the insurance company to cover your
car for a fi xed amount over a certain period of time. Most people
buy car insurance from one calendar year to the next, and what you
are doing is transferring risk from you to the insurance company.
If you are a safe driver and you don ’t wreck your car, all you will
have lost is the premium you paid for the policy. However, if you do
wind up getting in an accident, your insurance company pays you an
amount equal to what the value of the policy is. So, in a sense, you
are a buyer of an automobile put, and the underlying asset that’ s
covered is your car. Also, like an owner of a put you have to right to
collect on your policy should you have a need to. You don’ t have an
obligation to call up the insurance company but I’ m sure you will
anyway should you wreck your car. In the world of stock options you
can look at it this way; should you own stock, and then buy a put
on that stock, you are protected in the event you get into a “ stock
wreck ” as a result of “ market crash ” (yes, pun intended).
Here is an example: You own IBM at $ 94 and you decide to buy a
put with a strike price of $ 90; this guarantees that you will be able to
sell your stock at $ 90 for as long as your put is in force, even if IBM
goes to zero. If IBM goes to zero, you are still going to lose money,
but it is not going to be a catastrophic loss. You own IBM at $ 94 and
you will get to sell it at $ 90, therefore losing $ 4; plus, you will lose
what you paid for the option. Well, isn’ t that just like automobile
insurance? You might be driving around in a nice Mercedes that cost

you $ 94,000 but your insurance policy might pay out only $ 90,000
for the car, and on top of that you have to include what you paid for
the insurance policy to begin with. Yes, you will have lost $ 4,000, but
at least it wasn’ t a catastrophic loss. You can always buy more cover-
age next time so you don ’t lose on any other wrecks you might get
into, but what would be the trade- off for a larger insurance policy?
Yes, you would have to pay a higher premium to the insurance com-
pany. The same thing applies to put options. If you owned IBM at
$ 94 per share and wanted to be guaranteed that you could sell those
shares for $ 100 per share, you could do that. You would just have to
pay a higher premium for the extra intrinsic value. The more cover-
age you want, the more money you have to lay out.
Take a look at Figure 1 0.8 and you will see the puts listed in the
option chain. The strike price represents the locked- in sale price for
the owner of the puts. See how the premium in the ask column goes
up as the strike prices go up.
The cost of a put, like the call, has basically two parts to the p remium.
First is the intrinsic value, and second is the time value. The intrinsic
value is what you would make as a profi t should you exercise your option
and collect on your policy. Anything left over from that is the time value,
which, as discussed before, decays over time. This is the part that we like
because, as you will see in the next chapter, this time premium actually
works in our favor in a time premium collection strategy. Knowing how
to buy an option is just one small piece of a much larger picture because
if you understand how insurance p olicies work, you will know that
the insurance companies make more money off of the policies they
issue than the policyholders do when collecting on their claims.
Obligations versus Rights for Puts
Selling puts places you in an obligation agreement that binds you
to buy stock whenever the put owner wants to sell to you. In other

words, you become the insurance company for the policyholder. This
is an important point because if the stock drops in price, you will still
have to buy the stock even if the stock goes to zero. Therefore, there
is risk to you, the put seller. On the other hand, should the stock go
up in price and not close below the strike price on expiration day,
you still get to keep the premium that you collected when you fi rst
sold the put. We will be discussing some of the risks in selling options
in the next chapter, so stay tuned for that.
The Next Step
As we said earlier in this chapter, it’ s going to take time for you to fully
understand the power of options and what they can do for you as a
trader. There is a glossary of terms that you will fi nd at the back of this
book. Be sure to review these terms in order to become more familiar
with the ideas behind these fantastic tools. Once you have memorized
the defi nitions, it will be easier for you to pick up more educational
material that will help you fi ne - tune your trading skills. With a little
time and effort, your world will change as a result of your learning how
to trade the option markets.
We will continue our introduction to options in the next chapter,
where we start looking at how we can use them. Once we understand
the basic defi nitions and concepts, we can start exploring which strat-
egies to apply. Will we become hedgers or speculators? Should we
collect premium or buy it? Do we use the coupon or the insurance?
The world of trading really starts to open up when you realize that
there is much more available to you than “ Buy low and sell high. ”

Essential Options, Part 2
KNOWING YOUR STRATEGIES
w
e have often said that learning option strategy is like learning
a language. If you have ever attempted to speak a foreign language,
you will know it starts off with one word at a time, a sentence at
a time, then eventually you will learn how to speak in paragraphs.
Before you know it, you will be able to have conversations with others
who speak the language. With the exception of a few gifted individu-
als who have a knack for learning languages, most people will be
able to become fl uent in a few years, that is, of course, if the student
submerges himself in the culture in which the language is spoken.
Chapter 10 took you through some terms and concepts that will help
you get started in the language option traders use most. This chapter
will take you through some strategies that will help you maximize
your profi ts. As with other trading strategies, it is always important to
understand not only how the strategies work but also how to defend
yourself in the event the market moves against you and the strategies
do not work out as planned.
Before we get to the heart of our discussion regarding strategies,
we will need to cover a few more terms that will help you get a bet-
ter understanding of this new language. You will often hear option
traders refer to option contracts as being in- the - money, at- the - money,
and/or out- of - the - money. These are terms that are used to describe an
option ’s “ moneyness. ” An in - the - money option is one that has intrin-
sic value or, as discussed in Chapter 1 0 , a call option is in - the - money

when the option ’s strike price is below the price of the underlying
security. Seasoned option traders will be able to quickly determine
whether an option is in, at, or out of the money but for the beginner
it will take some focus and practice before one is completely fl uent.
Figure 1 1.1 will help keep things easy for you. Just remember that
an option will either have intrinsic value or not. So when expiration
day comes along the option will be worth the intrinsic value or it will
be worthless. Call options that have intrinsic value will be ones with
strike prices below the price of the underlying stock. Options that
have strike prices greater than or equal to the price of the underly-
ing stock will have no intrinsic value attached. Below are some simple
formulas that will help you with these defi nitions. You can copy this
chart and put in a place near your computer so you can refer to it
when needed.
Intrinsic value is just one of the parts that infl uence the price you
might pay for an option. With intrinsic value options also carry with
them premium known as time value. In general, in- the - money options will
have a small time premium attach to them along with out- of - the money
options. At - the - money options have the greatest amount of time premium
associated with their strikes and over time, as you become more familiar
with how time value works, you will see how time value can work either
for or against you depending on what kind of option strategy you are
using. Knowing how to quickly calculate the time value of an option will
give you an advantage in being able to select the right option strategy for
your portfolio.
One of the most important things you should know about time
value is that time value decays from the premium of the option as you
get closer to the expiration day for that particular option contract.
If you are buying an option contract, whether it is a call or a put,

you need the stock to move in the direction that favors your option
position otherwise you will lose money if the stock sits in a sideways
trading range. One of the biggest mistakes novice option traders
make when trading options is they have a tendency to reach for the
cheapest options on the board thinking that these are the best val-
ued options. In the world of options you should remember that you
get what you pay for. If you are thinking about buying cheap options,
then chances are you will wind up getting cheap performance. So if
you are buying the front- month options, that are out - of - the - money,
understand that the only thing left in the price of these options is
time value.
This is why the front- month options cost so much less than the
long - term options we call LEAPS . LEAPS is an acronym for long - term
equity anticipation security. With more time until expiration, LEAPS
have more life in them as compared to the front- month options. In
turn, this gives the owner of the LEAPS more time in the market,
which, in turn, gives them a greater chance to profi t. The trade of
for this luxury of time is simple: The more time you want to play in
the market, the more premium you will have to pay. To help you with
this idea, just think of an insurance policy — the longer the term, the
higher the premium.
On Expiration Day, the Option Must Be Worth
at Least Intrinsic Value
Many people hear that all options expire worthless at expiration so
let ’s put an end to this idea by saying this is defi nitely not true. It is
only the time value of and option that becomes worthless. If there
is any intrinsic value in the option it stays with that option.
For example, assume you own an option and today is expiration
day for that option. In your position you hold a call with a strike
price of $ 40 and the stock closes on expiration Friday at $ 45 per
share.
You own one $ 40 call which gives you the right to buy 100 shares
of the stock at $ 40 per share. If the stock closes that day at $ 45 per
share that option is worth at least $ 500 at the close of the market
on options expiration Friday. So the option is said to have $ 5 of
intrinsic value.
You can also refer to the pizza coupon in Chapter 1 0 and see
that if you had a pizza coupon that allowed you to buy a pizza for

224 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
$ 7.99 while the cost of pizzas around the world have now gone up to
$ 12.99 your intrinsic value for this pizza coupon is now $ 5.
Closing Your Option Position at Expiration
We said in the previous chapter that you are not required to ever buy
the shares of stock if you own a call option, but you do have the right
to do so. Most traders just take their profi ts by selling the contracts
in the open market without ever buying the shares. Now that you
know how to exercise your option contract and also understand how
to calculate intrinsic values, we will now show you that there really
isn ’t any difference between the two choices of either exercising your
option or closing it in the open market at expiration.
Assume that that you buy a $ 40 call for $ 5 and, at expiration,
the stock is trading for $ 50. You could call up your broker and tell
them you want to exercise your call, which would require your hav-
ing to pay $ 4,000 toward the purchase of the stock (remember each
option contract represents 100 shares of stock). Then you could
immediately sell 100 shares of stock at $ 50 per share and collect
$ 5,000 on the transaction. This, of course, would leave you will a net
(cid:1)
profi t of $ 500 because you originally paid $ 5 for the option (100
(cid:2)
$ 5 $ 500) but collected a profi t of $ 1,000, which was the difference
between your sale price of $ 50 per - share times 100 shares less your
buy price of $ 40 per share times 100 shares. Now, how would you do if
you just sold your option without exercising it? With the stock trad-
ing $ 50 a share your $ 40 call would have an intrinsic value of $ 10
(cid:1) (cid:2)
so if you sold it you would collect $ 1,000 (100 $ 10 $ 1,000), less
the $ 500 you paid for the option, leaves you with a profi t of $ 500.
So you would have a gain whether you exercised your option and
sold the stock in the open market or just sold the calls in the open
market.
The big difference that you have to consider is what might hap-
pen after you have closed out your position. If the stock goes higher
on the Monday after expiration Friday you may wish that you just
exercised the option and held on to the long stock position. Then
again, there is always the chance that the stock could drop after you
exercise your call option. This is a matter of how much risk you want
to take in the overall position. Just make sure the decision you make is
in favor of the trend that exists in that stock at that particular point
in time.

Essential Options, Part 2 225
Closing Your Option Prior to Expiration Friday
Okay, so there is no difference to us whether we close out of an
option at expiration when compared to exercising it and selling
the stock in the open market. What about if we wish to close out of the
option position prior to expiration? Well, now, this does make a dif-
ference and sometimes it makes a big difference. Assume you that
you buy a longer - term call option that has two months left before
expiration and you purchased a $ 40 call for $ 7 when the stock was
trading $ 45 per share. Let ’s also say that the stock is now trading for
$ 47 a share.
If you decide to go ahead and exercise your $ 40 call you will
again have to call up your broker and put in a request to exercise
your option. Once you do this you will have to pay out $ 4,000 to
buy 100 shares of the stock at $ 40 per share. You would then sell
your stock at $ 47 per share and collect $ 4,700. The credit received
for this transaction would be the difference between your sell price
and the exercise price which is $ 4,700 minus $ 4,000 or a profi t of
$ 700. But don’ t forget you paid $ 7 for the option, which works out
(cid:1) (cid:2)
to be a cost of $ 700 (100 shares $ 7 $ 700). When you subtract
the cost of the option from the profi t on the trade you are left with
a net profi t of ZERO. When you exercise an option early, you forfeit
the time premium and prematurely give it away to the person who
sold you the option in the fi rst place. Therefore, the majority of the
time, you would not want to exercise your option when there is time
value left in the premium.
Looking at the other scenario, we have the same position:
Long one $ 40 call with two months left until expiration. Your
purchase price for the option was $ 7 when the stock was trading $ 45
per share. Now that the stock is trading $ 47 per share, the premium
on that option has also gone up to $ 8.50. Should you close the posi-
tion by selling the call in the open market you will be able to collect
(cid:1) (cid:2)
a credit of $ 850 (100 $ 8.50 $ 850). This credit of $ 850 less the
$ 700 you paid for the option allows you to collect a net profi t of
$ 150. So you need to be careful before you decide to exercise your
options. Carefully consider how much time value you would be giving
up before you call up your broker to go through with you exercise
instructions. The reason there is no difference between exercising
a call at expiration when compared to selling it in the open mar-
ket is because there is no time value left in the option. There is no

time remaining on Expiration Friday, and the time value is therefore
nothing. Prior to expiration, time value does count and there can be
signifi cant differences between the two choices.
As you become more familiar with options, you’ ll hear caveats to
the “ don ’t exercise early” rule such as only exercise early to capture
a dividend. Exercising early may make sense, but it really only offsets
some small losses. Most dividends are small and usually not our con-
cern as traders of call options (unless it is a large, surprise dividend).
But, for now, just understand that in the vast majority of cases, it is
never to your advantage to exercise a call option early. If you wish to
take profi ts, simply sell the call option in the open market. Now you
see why the majority of contracts are just closed in the open market.
Most traders never intend to buy the shares and just buy and sell the
contracts by themselves.
Let ’s Talk Volatility
Okay, we have talked about the basics of call options, and we’ ve said
that they are not that much different from pizza coupons other than
the fact that options have value. So why do you suppose that pizza
coupons have no value whereas call options do? Many are inclined to
say that it ’s due to the prices and that stocks are far more expensive
than options. That ’s partially true, but the bigger reason is because
of the uncertainty of prices. You can be almost certain that the $ 7.99
pizza price will stay just about the same and as competitive the pizza
market is, there is a good chance that the price of pizza may even fall.
Because we are fairly certain about the prices we will pay for pizza
next week, next month or even next year for pizza, there ’s no reason
we would want to “ lock in” the price of pizza. As a consequence,
pizza coupons have no real value other than a slight discount off of
the normal price of a pie.
Options, however, do carry value since stock prices can change
so unpredictably. One day, the stock will be up and the next day
it could be down 10 percent or more. We just never know what is
going to happen to the price from one day to the next. Because of
this uncertainty, traders and investors are very willing to pay for the
right to lock in a price for the stock. Their goal is to avoid holding
the stock and having to lay out large sums of money in the process.
Stock prices that exhibit dramatic price ranges are considered to
be more volatile than one that does not. While there are many ways

to measure the volatility of a stock, just understand that the more
volatile the stock ’s price, the more money people are willing to pay
for an option. Therefore, a one- month, at - the - money option on a
more volatile stock will be much more expensive than a one- month,
at - the - money option on a less volatile stock. In the next section, we
will talk about some easy- to - learn strategies that will help you profi t
from both sides of the market — the upside and downside — while at
the same time considering how volatility comes into play.
Long Calls
Let ’s start with one of the most basic option strategies: the long call
position. We ’ ve shown that call options get more valuable as the stock
price rises. For any given strike or “ coupon ” price you hold, the higher
the price, the more someone will be willing to buy your coupon for
and as a result they will bid a higher price in order to hold it.
Let ’s compare two traders, Trader A and Trader B, who are
both looking to trade 1,000 shares of Wal - Mart (ticker symbol:
WMT). Trader A will be using stock, while Trader B uses options.
In Figure 1 1.2 you can see that Trader A has laid out $ 48,000 to
buy 1,000 shares of Wal- Mart. Having this much money in this posi-
tion means that it’ s possible to lose a signifi cant amount should
Wal - Mart shares crash.
Trader B can accomplish the same thing with less risk by buying
10 of the call options. Buying 10 option contracts for $ 3.50 will cost

==================================================

228 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
a total of $ 3,500 plus commissions and no matter what happens to
the price of Wal - Mart between now and June expiration, Trader B
has a defi ned maximum loss potential of $ 3,500. Notice that Trader
A does not have a defi ned loss potential even if he uses a stop loss
order. Stop loss orders do not defi ne maximum loss potential should
the stock move against you. Trader A is now long 1,000 shares of
WMT while Trader B owns 10 $ 45 calls. If Wal - Mart falls more than
$ 3.50 per share or lower by expiration, Trader A is going to wish he
had bought the calls instead. Trader A will continue to suffer losses
for all prices below $ 44.50, whereas Trader B will no longer have to
suffer a loss below the $ 3.50 paid for the option. You can only lose
what you pay for an option and no more.
Now let’ s take a look at the stock to see what would happen if the
stock were to rise. Let ’s assume that Wal- Mart rises and is now trad-
ing $ 55 per share (see Figure 11.3 ). Trader A paid $ 48 per share and
sold it at $ 55 per share for a profi t of $ 7,000 less commissions.
This $ 7 - per - share gain works out to be a profi t of 14.6 percent.
However, with a $ 7 rise in the stock the June $ 45 calls now have
intrinsic value of $ 10. Trader B paid $ 3.50 for the calls and can now
sell them for at least $ 10 in the open market for a $ 6.50 gain, which
works out to be a profi t of 186 percent.
This is just one simple example of how a trader can get lever-
age in the market without having to lay out large sums of money to
trade, and this example shows what can happen if the stock makes
a big percentage move in price. The other thing to consider is that

Essential Options, Part 2 229
when you buy options, you need the stock to move. We need speed
for the option to be most effective and if the stock drops just below
the strike price and closes there, the owner of the option will lose
that amount paid for the option because at that point there will be
no intrinsic value in the option and the calls will expire worthless.
This is the trade- off when compared to trading a stock position.
Shares of stock do not have expiration dates, so you will be able to
hold on to the stock position long after the options have expired,
and should the stock rally afterward, you could eventually get a
return on your investment. So the lesson you need to learn here
is to make sure you are buying calls that help you position yourself
in the direction of the trend, and should the stock continue in an
upward trend, the returns can be far better than if you had just
purchased the shares alone.
Long Puts
Let ’s now assume that you are bearish on Wal - Mart and you wish to
short shares of the stock. For many people, the concept of short-
ing is still very unfamiliar. Short selling is simply a way for you to
sell stock that you do not own in order to profi t from a downturn
in the stock. To do this, you would borrow stock from your broker
with a promise to return those shares to them at a later date. Once
you have borrowed the stock, you would then sell those shares in
the open market with the intention of buying them back at a lower
price. So the idea is to sell high and buy low, then keep the differ-
ence. However, should you sell the shares that you borrowed from
your broker and the price of that stock goes up after you have taken
the short position, you subject yourself to unlimited loss potential
because there is no limit to how high a stock can go. Eventually, you
will have to buy back the stock in order to repay your loan, and this
unlimited loss potential is one of the reasons most people shy away
from the short - selling strategy.
Buying puts allows you to take advantage of a downturn in the
market without subjecting yourself to the unlimited loss potential.
In Chapter 10 , we discussed how puts act as insurance policies for
the person who owns stock. But you don ’t have to own stock to buy
puts; you can own an asset that acts like a short stock position. The
terms we used for calls, with regard to the “ moneyness ” of the option,
also apply for puts with one exception: Put premiums go up when

the stock price goes down. Figure 1 1.4 will help you understand the
difference between in - , at - , or out - of - the - money strike prices for puts.
The best thing about owning a put versus shorting the stock is
that the most you can lose is the amount you paid for the put.
Let ’s revisit Traders A and B to see how they compare when trad-
ing the “ short side ” strategies. Trader A has decided to borrow 1,000
shares of Wal - Mart from his broker and sell them in the open market
for $ 48 per share (Figure 11.5 ). Trader B has chosen to buy 10 June
$ 50 puts for $ 2.50, which costs a total of $ 2,500 for the total option
position plus the cost of commissions.
Both traders want the stock to drop to maximize their profi t
potential, but let’ s fi rst look at the risk to the upside in both positions.
Remember that Trader A has a loan to pay back, which is to deliver
the shares he has borrowed from his broker, so should the stock go
up by $ 10 per share, Trader A would have to buy back the stock at a

higher price than where he sold it in the fi rst place. Trader A has to
make a decision to either buy back the shares at $ 58 or not buy back
the shares and continue to stay exposed to an unlimited risk position.
For now, let ’s just say Trader A decides to get out of this position that’ s
hurting him and takes the loss. Buying back 1,000 shares at $ 58 would
(cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:2)
create a loss of $ 10,000 ($ 58 $ 48 1,000 shares $ 10,000). After
the shares are bought back, Trader A returns the shares back to his
broker and is left with the loss in his account.
Trader B, however, has a different position to deal with. With a
long put position that is totally paid for, Trader B is now long the
10 June $ 50 puts. With the stock trading at $ 58, these puts have no
intrinsic value; however, if there is any time left before Expiration
Friday, the June $ 50 puts may still have some time value left in them.
The great thing about owning the put versus selling the stock short
is that Trader A is completely out of his position with no chance to
recover a profi t, while Trader B still has a chance to make a profi t
even though the puts are worth less than the price he paid to open
the position.
On the positive side, puts work very well to leverage buying power
in that stocks have a tendency to drop faster than they rally. This has
a lot to do with the emotional charge of the market. As mentioned
in previous chapters, fear has a way of charging the market with vola-
tility, and volatility is an option trader’ s best friend. If the stock were
to drop to $ 40, this would allow Trader B to lock in $ 10 or intrinsic
value. Owning the $ 50 puts gives Trader B the right to sell stock at
$ 50, so once the trader buys the stock at $ 40, he can immediately
sell those shares for $ 50. This $ 10 profi t less the cost of the puts
( $ 2.50) winds up giving Trader B a $ 7.50 profi t which is close to a
300 percent return after commissions are paid out. It ’s not uncom-
mon to see these types of returns in the option markets. Of course,
you should not expect to profi t on every single trade you make
but the important thing to remember is that your downside risk is
precalculated so you are more likely to stay consistent in your per-
formance if you have mastered the stock selection process we have
outlined for you.
Cash - Secured Put Selling
The long put gives us the right to sell stock at a predetermined price,
but one of our favorite strategies is to sell puts in stocks that show

signs of good strong support or stocks that indicate upward trends
with positive volume on the technical charts. Before you initiate a
strategy such as this, it ’s important for you to understand that you
would never consider selling puts in stocks that are breaking down
below key support levels or in stocks that are in downward trends.
Should you do this, you would be placing yourself in a high- risk posi-
tion. You should approach a short put strategy in the same way an
insurance company would approach a potential policy holder. Would
an insurance company issue a life insurance policy on a person who
was terminally ill? Or . . . would the insurance agent ever insure a
driver who had a long history of drunk driving? Of course not—
insurance companies hire actuaries, who make sure the companies
they work for are not taking unnecessary risk. Unless the premiums
were out of this world and over the top, insurance companies would
go bankrupt if they made it a policy to insure only high- risk individu-
als, so why would you, the put seller, ever consider high - risk stocks?
The put- selling strategy we teach is one where you would sell puts
only in stocks that you would consider owning. If you were willing to
buy shares of Wal- Mart, you could obligate yourself to buy the stock at a
given strike price and in return receive a premium for the risk you take.
The strike price you sell is the agreed - upon price at which you would
commit to purchase the shares. So the role you take in this example is
that of the insurer. You would collect a premium for providing the put
buyer with the peace of mind of knowing that if the stock drops, you
will be there to limit their loss. However, you want the stock to stay fl at
or go up from that point. The last thing you want to happen is for the
stock to crash. Similarly, the last thing the insurance company would
want to have happen is for you to crash your car after they have insured
you. Do people crash their cars from time to time? Yes, but the insur-
ance company assumes this risk, betting that you will not crash your car.
Therefore, they look to insure safe drivers who have a clean history of
accident -f ree driving.
Stocks that show strong signs of support and ones that have
good upward trends are the types of stocks you would want to insure.
When you fi nd stocks like this, you would put up enough cash in
your account to secure the purchase of the shares; should you be
“ put ” the stock — in other words, be asked to fulfi ll your obligation —
the cash moves out of your money market fund and you buy the
stock. As an insurer of stock price, it’ s also important for you to know
where your breakeven point is for the stock. If the stock trades from

$ 48 per share down to $ 44 per share, you will still be able to make a
profi t because, although the stock is below the strike price, your cost
basis is still below $ 44.
This is where your technical analysis skills will come into play.
If you see that the stock has good, strong support around the $ 43
area, you might make a decision to hold on to this new long stock
position because there is a chance that it could rally from this point.
Your cost basis is $ 43.50 so even though the stock is trading at $ 44
you may still be able to squeak out a profi t of $ .50. However, if you
see that the stock is not holding support, you would make a decision
to close out of your position to minimize risk. Remember that you
don ’t want to be buying stocks that are crashing. In this chapter we
are just grazing over some of the basic strategies we use, and you will
need to delve into more of the details surrounding these concepts
to become more fl uent in this put- selling strategy. The label we use to
identify this strategy is c ash - secured put selling . Figure 11.6 is an exam-
ple of what this would look like in your trading account.
The Covered Call
Most traders who are new to options will always hear about the cov-
ered call since it is considered to be a basic, safe strategy. Let’ s take
a look at how it works.
Let ’s assume you own 300 shares of Wal - Mart at $ 45 (maybe you
got assigned on a short put— hopefully, you ’ re starting to see how
you can combine option strategies to gain even more fl exibility).

You ’ re willing to hold the shares and are now waiting for it to rise.
Rather than wait, you can sell a call against your shares. By selling
a call, you have an obligation to sell shares if the long call holder
decides to exercise his right to buy. You could sell three contracts of
(cid:1) (cid:2)
the July $ 50 calls at $ 2.75, which is a total credit of 300 $ 2.75 $ 825.
Again, this cash is available for your immediate use to use however
you wish.
You would just call your broker and say, “ Sell to open, three
contracts, of the Wal- Mart July $ 50 calls, at market. ” You would then
be long 300 shares of stock and short three $ 50 calls.
If the stock rises above $ 50 at expiration, you would be required
to sell for $ 50. If the stock stays still, you get to keep the $ 825, which
is something that the long stock holder will never see. Notice that
this credit provides a little downside protection, too. If the stock
falls $ 2.75 below your cost basis, you ’ re still at breakeven. The ini-
tial credit from the sale acts as a cushion against adverse stock price
movements.
The reason this is called a “ covered call” is that you already own
shares of the underlying stock. In other words, the upside risk of a
short call is already “ covered ” by the long shares of stock. You have no
need to worry about being able to deliver the shares if the stock rises.
Of course, you still have all of the downside risk that the long stock
owner has, but you were willing to assume that anyway. What if you
weren’ t willing to hold the shares but entered the covered call anyway?
Now you ’ re speculating with options, and it is then considered a risky
position. The risk in options depends on how you are using them.
Chatter Box—AJ
With over two and a half decades spent in the option markets, I have,
for the most part, favored selling option premiums. I feel comfortable
taking on the role of “the insurance company” for stock traders, but
before you begin selling option premiums, please make it a point to
understand all of your risk points. This includes your obligated buy or
sell points, breakeven points, and strategies you would use to bail out
of a risky situation should the stock price move against you.

the skies begin to darken and the seas start to swell, insurance compa-
nies will send out the alarm to all of their representatives to cease all
activity with regard to accepting new insurance applications. Why do
they do this? It’s simple: There is a much greater chance that they will
have to pay out claims as the storm heads for the coast. So they do this
in an effort to eliminate additional risk should the storm hit.
A perfect example of this was when Hurricane Katrina came rip-
ping through Florida. Rick and I were actually recording one of our
radio shows when Katrina fi rst hit the east coast of Florida. I was stuck
in a hotel room in Palm Beach after fi nishing up a seminar, and we
were talking about the possibility of this whopper of a storm regroup-
ing in the Gulf of Mexico. While we had no idea this would be the
deadliest storm in U.S. history, it just so happened that the topic of
our discussion was risk management. We were using this storm as an
analogy to describe what investors would do to limit risk in a fi nancial
storm. We have this show archived on the Internet where we men-
tioned that if Katrina strengthened in the Gulf, it would be a powerful
one, and those who lived on the Gulf shores should run for cover. It’s
unfortunate that more people didn’t listen to the warnings we put out,
but our point is if you are insuring stock price, you had better heed the
warnings when the fi nancial storm front approaches. If you are ever in
doubt about what to do when you’re in a risky position, it is best to just
close that position out and take the loss rather than to attempt to ride
out the storm. I have seen too many people bury their heads in the
sand when they get confused. This ostrich approach to trading is not
a strategy at all and can wind up with only one outcome: big losses.
Just be smart and use your common sense.
Rick
It has been said that common sense is the least common sense of
all. Unfortunately, many traders who are otherwise very smart and
calculating individuals tend to ignore the warnings that the market
gives them. Perhaps it really is the same mind-set that affects the
beach dwellers in hurricane country. They fi gure that they’ve made it
through the storms this far without taking a direct hit. They’re lulled into
a sense of invincibility that is broken only by the catastrophic loss. If AJ
and I can get you to take away only one point in this discussion, it is
this: Learn from those who have been through the storm and know its
power. You can really profi t from trading, but only when you give the
market the respect it requires.

Now You Have Options
The strategies we covered in this chapter are just a small fraction of
what ’s available to you. You can even combine strategies to create
risk/reward profi les that are better suited for your tastes — and that
is something that cannot be done with stock alone.
Options were created as a way to buy and sell risk. If there is a risk
you ’r e willing to assume, you can now get paid to assume it. If there
is a risk you don’ t want, you can pay someone to assume it for you.
Once you understand that options are about reducing risk, you’ ll
see that they are not meant to be risky at all. Of course, someone can
speculate and bet lots of money just because they have a hunch that
the stock will rise or fall. That person is a speculator. But you must
realize that doesn’ t mean that the whole options market is comprised
of speculators. These risk seekers may be buying or selling options to
traders and investors who are using them to reduce the risk in their
portfolios. The options market is the only forum that allows us to
meet speculators and trade risk.
Not all option strategies are speculative; it all depends on how
they are used. If you think you ’ ve found some interesting aspects to
options trading, we encourage you to fi nd out more. If not, there’ s
no harm done and you can at least say you know more about them
than when you started. Either way, you’ re a better investor or trader
for taking the time to learn about this fascinating market!

Managing Risk
LEARNING TO LOSE MONEY THE RIGHT WAY
I
s it reasonable to trade the markets and expect not to lose money?
The answer is no, of course. So the challenge for any trader or inves-
tor is to know when to close a trade at a loss so that you can stay to
trade another day. We refer to this as learning to lose the right way.
The stunned looks on the faces of our audience still amuse us when
we step before a new group at a fi nancial conference and announce
that our fi rst goal is to teach the correct way to lose money. More than
a few people reply that they already have that part of the game down
pat, no more instruction needed. Joking aside, do you really know
how to lose money in such a way that you can remain in the markets
for the profi ts?
The Market Guys ’ approach to limiting losses is called the 1%
Rule. In a nutshell, you shouldn’ t lose more than 1 percent of your
trading account value on any given trade. Let’ s break the rule down
a little before we move forward.
First, your trading account is not your net worth. We don ’t
recommend actively trading with more than about 20 percent of
your portfolio value. The rest of the 80 percent should be allocated
according to your overall fi nancial plan and may include such invest-
ments as cash, bonds, real estate, and dividend stocks or funds. To
keep the numbers easy, let’ s assume that your entire portfolio is
worth $ 500,000. In that case, your trading account should not be
greater than $ 100,000.

==================================================

240 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
Second, each and every trade is capped to a loss of 1 percent of
the trading account. Your fi rst trade in our example account should
not lose more than 1 percent of $ 100,000, or $ 1,000. If you have
two open positions, they each get $ 1,000 for a total possible loss of
$ 2,000. Notice that we’ re not saying anything about the stock yet.
The stock may fall 10 percent, but the corresponding loss in your
account should not exceed $ 1,000. We ’ ll explain how to tie these two
concepts together later in the chapter.
Finally, there is nothing magical about 1 percent. It’ s a good
number that we have found to work very well in practice. If you tend
to be an active day trader, you might want to reduce the 1 percent to
½ percent. However, if you trade less often and tend to hold your
trades for six months or longer, you would do well with a 2 percent limit.
The point that we want to stress is that you shouldn ’t adjust it on the fl y.
If you ’ re using the 1% Rule, then every trade should follow the rule.
Is There Really Such Thing as a Safe Investment?
Certainly, some investments carry different types and degrees of risk,
but you need to recognize that every fi nancial venture includes
risk. Even if you have insider information that would guarantee your
returns, you assume the risk of getting a call from the attorney gen-
eral about your trading patterns prior to the release of the news that
propelled your stock.
In order to understand the bigger picture of risk in the mar-
kets, it ’s helpful to list the risks and see where we might encounter
them. By reviewing the variety of ways that we may be impacted, you
develop an appreciation of the inherent nature of fi nancial risk and
how to best manage these risks.
Market risk. Market risk is the risk associated with falling stock
prices when the market moves as a whole. This is the risk most
familiar to traders because it captures the loss of value when
the equity drops due to market forces. Market risk is gener-
ally associated with an entire market, asset class, or segment
of the broad market. As the name implies, it is a risk to our
position when the overall market forces conspire against us.
The old saying about a rising tide lifting all boats is another
way to describe market risk. In the same way, a falling tide
tends to leave even the good boats stranded on the beach.

==================================================

Managing Risk 241
Business risk. The risk that is unique to the specific business that
you ’ re trading or investing in is known as the business risk.
The overall market may be doing just fine, but you read
in the press that your company just announced they ’ re
starting a new series of internal seminars entitled, “ Keep-
ing the Books the ENRON Way. ” This would likely create
a business risk that would have a somewhat deleterious
impact on the stock price.
Credit risk. The risk associated with bonds is commonly known
as credit risk. This is the possibility of a default by the bond
issuer where they are unable to pay interest or principle in
a timely manner. Credit risk is higher with corporate bonds
than with government bonds since corporate bonds are
backed by the strength of the issuing company, whereas
government bonds are backed by the taxing authority of the
issuing municipality.
Interest rate risk. When a debt security such as a bond decreases
in value as the interest rates rise, this is called interest rate
risk. Bond values generally drop with a rise in interest rates,
even though the bond will continue to pay its stated interest
rate until maturity. For example, let’ s assume you buy a bond
with a 6 percent coupon when the prevailing interest rate is
6 percent. You would most likely pay par, or the face value of
the bond. However, if you wanted to buy a 6 percent coupon
when the prevailing interest rate is 4 percent, you would pay
a premium over par for the added value of a higher coupon.
Likewise, if you bought this same bond at a premium and
then interest rates rose to 10 percent, your coupon would be
worth less and, therefore, you would have to discount your
bond if you wanted to sell it. That is how interest rate risk
affects a debt security investment.
Currency risk. Currency risk is the risk that comes from volatility
in exchange rates between various currencies. Many com-
panies that have extensive international business also have
hedging programs to mitigate the impact of currency risk.
This risk comes into play when you buy a company with sub-
stantial international exposure. However, it may also impact
you directly when you trade on a foreign exchange and need
to convert your currency for trading. This is also known as

==================================================

242 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
exchange rate risk. With the growth in forex trading, many
individual traders are able to create their own currency
hedges to protect against this type of risk.
Country risk. As we write this book, Venezuela’ s President Chavez
is seeking to exert greater national control over the banks
and industries within his country. He is quoted as telling one
steelmaker, “ I ’ ll grab your company.” As a result, the main
index of the Caracas stock exchange fell almost 3 percent
while Venezuela ’s currency, the bolivar, also fell about 3 per-
cent. This type of country - specific volatility is known as coun-
try risk. It is usually political in nature, but the results are
directly seen in investments that are exposed to the country ’s
turmoil.
Liquidity risk. If you own an investment that is not readily turned
into cash when you’ re ready to sell it, you are subject to
liquidity risk. Hard assets such as real estate and vehicles are
most susceptible to liquidity risk. However, stocks with very
low volume or funds that aren ’t publicly traded also run into
liquidity risk. If you buy 100,000 shares of a penny stock that
trades only 5,000 shares per day on average, it will be very
difficult for you to sell your position without driving down
the stock price.
Inflation risk. Inflation risk is what you encounter when you have
such a distrust of the markets that you invest only in your
mattress fund. Every dollar you invest goes right into the
sack under your mattress. Even in this case, your money isn’ t
growing to keep up with inflation and, while your principal
doesn ’t decrease, your buying power falls. It’ s easy to see how
$ 50 that was stashed in a coffee can in 1950 isn’ t going to get
you the same level of goods and services today as it did then.
Regulatory risk. Will Rogers is quoted as saying, “ The only differ-
ence between death and taxes is that death doesn’ t get worse
every time Congress meets.” He was creatively describing what
is known as regulatory risk. This is the unknown and unpre-
dictable consequences of changing laws and regulations.
Whether we’ re talking about long - term versus short- term cap-
ital gains, distribution requirements for retirement accounts,
or corporate tax policy, the activities of our elected officials
represent an undercurrent of risk in every financial venture.

Managing Risk 243
I ’d Like to Buy a Vowel
Now that we’ ve described the myriad ways in which your money can
shrink beyond recognition, where does that leave us? Some readers
at this point may be thinking that any trade or investment is simply a
spin on their own personal Wheel of Fortune. “ Since I can ’t control
my fi nancial destiny, I may as well spin for the new car!” they reason
to themselves. Of course, there are many varied risks that we face, but
it should rather leave us with the clear understanding that risk is ever
present and that we shouldn’ t attempt to avoid risk. Risk is a factor that
must be recognized and properly managed, not avoided entirely.
One of the problems with managing risk is our skewed percep-
tion of the risks that we face. In A gainst the Gods: The Remarkable Story
of Risk (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1996), Peter Bernstein relates
this story:
One winter night during one of the many German air raids
on Moscow in World War II, a distinguished Soviet profes-
sor of statistics showed up in his local air- raid shelter. He had
never appeared there before. “ There are seven million people
in M oscow, ” he used to say. “ Why should I expect them to hit
me? ” His friends were astonished to see him and asked what had
happened to change his mind. “ Look, ” he explained, “ there are
seven million people in Moscow and one elephant. Last night
they got the elephant. ”
We recently presented a seminar at the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. Just prior to the start of the second day, one of the attend-
ees was talking to his brother, who had purchased 200 out - of - the -
money call contracts on Yahoo! (ticker symbol: YHOO). On this
particular morning, rumors were rampant about a possible buyout
of Yahoo! by Microsoft. The contracts that were purchased for mere
pennies were now over $ 3 in- the - money. Absent a major news event
such as this, it is quite likely that the contracts would have expired
worthless. Now, our friend ’s brother was enjoying a profi t of more
than $ 60,000. The next time this trader picks up a load of cheap out-
of - the - money options, how much confi dence of making a profi t do
you think he ’ ll display? Most likely, he will be thinking about this last
trade and considering the possibility of doing it all over again, even
though the likelihood is quite small.

244 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
On the other side of the trade, consider the trader who sold
the contracts. Especially consider the scene if the trader sold them
naked; that is, he didn’ t own shares of Yahoo! to deliver when the
options were assigned to him. In effect, he is short the stock and has
to come up with $ 60,000 cash to cover his exposed position. How
likely do you think this same trader will be to sell uncovered calls
again? Once again, the probability of losing money from selling the
calls is very small. It is just as likely as our friend’ s brother making
money by purchasing the same contracts. But his experience showed
him that it can happen, and all future decisions will be clouded by
that experience.
This is the contemporary market version of the P ort - Royal Logic ,
published in 1662. Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole noted that
people overestimated the probability of being struck by lightning in
a thunderstorm. Statistically, the odds of such an occurrence may be
very low but the consequences are high and, therefore, add weight to
the fears beyond the mere likelihood of occurrence. Furthermore,
any experience with a lightning strike (having witnessed a strike,
knowing an acquaintance that experienced a strike, etc.) only added
to the fears. The underlying probability didn’ t change, but the p ercep-
tion is greatly infl uenced by these other factors. When we experience
a “ highly unlikely ” market event, it’ s all but impossible not to take
the event into account when we face future risk/reward decisions.
Everyone Should Be Above Average
We’ ve talked many times about the importance of having a trading
plan that removes your emotion from the decision process and holds
you accountable for your defi ned strategy. The biases we just dis-
cussed that we bring to our degree of confi dence in trading and
investing decisions are another reason for having a strict risk man-
agement plan. Some traders like to adjust their risk levels as their
confi dence in a trade rises or falls. As a rule, this will not serve your
best interests. We offer this advice more from a practical standpoint
than from an empirical study. We have watched traders take this
approach, and it usually comes back to bite them.
As much as we’ d all like to believe that we ’ re different, there
is also a fundamental misunderstanding of probability and statistics
among the general population. There’ s a reason that college fresh-
men refer to this subject as “ Probability and Sadistics.” For most of

us, we ’ re not going to improve our lot by estimating probabilities in
trading and investing decisions.
Perhaps the most famous evangelist on the subject of statistics- based
decision making was W. Edwards Deming. Dr. Deming worked with
Japan in the rebuilding of the post– World War II economy, teaching
the principles of statistical quality improvement. In 1960, the emperor
of Japan awarded him the Second Order Medal of the Sacred Treas-
ure for his contributions. In 1982, he published his classic book, O ut
of the Crisis (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press), highlighting his approach
to decision making through data analysis. Dr. Deming included the
following two news articles that demonstrate how statistical misunder-
standing can be our Achilles heel in making sound decisions. The fi rst
article, published in 1983, is from the S an Diego Union. Author Bob
Dvorchak writes:
“ In general, we have been blessed with above- average leader-
ship, ” said Robert K. Murray, who is tabulating the responses of
970 historians questioned in the survey.
“ We’ ve been remarkably lucky, considering the relatively hap-
hazard way we select a president. Historians have determined
that almost one out of every four has been great or near great,
and over half are above average,” said the professor of history at
Pennsylvania State University.
It ’s important to note that “ greatness ” is defi ned as being in the
top 25 percent. Should we not, therefore, expect that one in four
would end up in the top 25 percent? What a travesty that one in
four should be in the bottom 25 percent!
The next article was published in 1983 in the W isconsin State
Journal under the headline, “ Half Still under Median ” :
Despite the increase, union officials said, more than half the
league ’s players earned less than the league - wide median of
$ 75,000 a year.
Recognizing that the median, by defi nition, is the point that
separates the top half from the bottom half, how do we resolve the
problem stated above? Should we not be equally concerned about
the fact that nobody makes more than the top - paid player? Nobody!

Let ’s take one more example to illustrate the disconnect between
probability and expected outcome. The lottery is quite similar to the
trader who speculates with very cheap options or penny stocks. In both
cases, the cash outlay is very small and the likelihood of success is cor-
respondingly small. Nevertheless, our judgment is clouded by visions
of what we’ ll do when the 15 - cent option is now trading with $ 5 of
intrinsic value. One of the top lotteries in the United States is the Mega
Millions game. This lottery requires the player to choose fi ve numbers
from 56 choices. On top of this, the player selects one Mega Millions
number from a total of 46 choices. The jackpot is hit when all six num-
bers match the winning drawing. The Mega Millions site lists the odds
of winning the jackpot at 1 in 175,711,536. Ask any player at the local
convenience store what they think about their chances of winning
and they’ ll always admit to an infl ated possibility. “ Someone has to win, ”
they ’ ll reason. However, their interests are not served by “ someone ”
winning; their interests are served when they win. And the likelihood of
someone ’s winning is much greater than the likelihood of their winning.
Five Principles of Risk Management
There are myriad reasons to employ a solid risk management strat-
egy. If you distill the reasons down to the simplest concept, it is the
fact that risk management is the single most important key to suc-
cess in the markets. Gamblers in Vegas make money from time to
time. These runs are called streaks, and they occur in the markets,
too. However, whether a streak is long or short, there will come
a time when the markets zig at the very moment we think they
will zag. When that moment arrives, our lifesaver will be our risk
management plan. Here are fi ve principles of The Market Guys’
approach to managing risk:
1. R isk management moves you from emotion to discipline.
2. R isk management allows for more losses.
3. R isk management requires an understanding of technical
analysis.
4. R isk management starts with stock selection.
5. R isk management is non - negotiable.
1. Risk Management Moves You from Emotion to Discipline
Have you received the message by now that our emotions don ’t treat
us well when it comes to managing our money? Left to our own

devices, we tend to do stupid things with our money. Granted, that’ s
not the most technical presentation of the facts, but it is the truth.
For that reason, when we develop a plan to manage trading risk, it
is imperative that the plan be designed in such a way as to minimize
our interference in the execution of the plan. Simply, we need to
create a foolproof plan and recognize that it is ourselves that we’ re
protecting against.
To illustrate this, we can look at a popular experimental eco-
nomics game referred to as the “ Ultimatum Game.” In the Ultima-
tum Game, two players are given the opportunity to divide a sum
of money, and there is no reciprocation. That is, each player only
has to make one decision and the game is over. To start, player A is told
to divide an amount, say $ 10, between player A and player B. The
split can be any ratio, with one exception: Player A cannot keep
the entire amount. The worst case split for player B is that player
A will choose to keep $ 9 and give $ 1 to player B. The next step is
for player B to decide whether to accept or reject player A ’s offer.
If player B accepts the offer, then both players get the amount of
money set forth in the offer. If player B chooses to reject the offer,
then both players walk away empty - handed. Here ’s the key ques-
tion: When is it advantageous for player B to reject an offer? The
answer, of course, is never! In the worst - case scenario, if player B
accepts the offer, he will still receive $ 1 that he otherwise wouldn’ t
have. However, experimental results show that offers of less than
20 percent ( $ 2 in our example) are often rejected. Subsequent inves-
tigation reveals that there is an element of “ fairness ” that’ s consid-
ered by player B, and if the offer is perceived as “ unfair, ” then the
offer is rejected. Player B would choose the defense of perceived
fairness rather than improve his fi nancial condition if they appear to
be mutually exclusive choices.
Before you think that you ’ re the exceptional trader who can
overcome this propensity through sheer determination, consider
this: A research study scanned the brains of Ultimatum Game
players as they responded to fair and unfair proposals. The results
were published in a 2003 article in S cience magazine entitled “ The
Neural Basis of Economic Decision- Making in the Ultimatum Game.”
It was shown that unfair offers elicited activity in brain areas related
to emotion, which suggests an important role for emotions in deci-
sion making. The conclusion for the trader is that we have to recog-
nize that our emotions are an integral part of our fi nancial decision
making and then take the necessary steps to ensure that we don ’t

harm ourselves in the process. Of all professions, the trader must
take care to address this point since fi nancial decisions are made
every trading day.
2. Risk Management Allows for More Losses
It doesn ’t make any difference how well you trade if you get kicked out
of the game. You may trade for profi ts for years, and one moment of
careless trading without proper risk management may wipe out your
accumulated profi ts. Managing risk in a systematic and disciplined way
will let you take more losses without a catastrophic loss. In the next sec-
tion, we provide the steps for applying the 1% Rule to your trading. For
now, consider the trader who loses only 1 percent of his trading account
each time he has a losing trade. The sequence of losses and account bal-
ance would look like the one shown in Table 12.1.
Table 12.1 Sequence of 1 Percent Losses

Notice how this trader could start with a $ 100,000 account and
then have 20 losses in a row. After the twentieth loss, he would still
have almost $ 82,000 in his trading account. This highlights how a
good risk management plan allows you to take more losses and still
remain in the markets.
An analysis of how well we tend to accept losses was developed
by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, in their landmark research
into Prospect Theory. The short description of Prospect Theory is
that people are much more willing to gamble with losses than with
profi ts. This concept is actually quite familiar to traders because we
are quick to lock in a profi t while allowing losses to continue, in the
hope that our patience will be rewarded by a rebound in the stock
price. Gambling with a loss is known as l oss aversion: the tendency
for people to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains.
Conversely, when we quickly lock in our profi ts, we ’ re exercising risk
aversion: we shun any risk when we have a profi t in hand. Some stud-
ies suggest that losses are as much as twice as psychologically power-
ful as gains. This phenomenon serves to dramatically increase the
level of risk that a trader will accept with a losing position. We don’ t
want to accept the negative emotions that come with a loss and will go
to great lengths to avoid a loss. However, many times, the losses are
not avoided but rather deferred. When we practice loss aversion and
watch the unrealized losses continue to grow, we’ ll eventually reach
a point where even the unrealized loss becomes untenable and the
position is closed.
In the markets, the movement that occurs when masses of traders
fi nally realize a loss that has become unbearable is known as capitu-
lation selling. The rapid downward drop in price with a correspond-
ing spike in volume is often the result of emotional decision making
rather than a thoughtful, well - executed risk management plan.
3. Risk Management Requires an Understanding of Technical Analysis
If you buy a stock, you make money when the stock price goes up.
That sounds like we’ re stating the obvious, but many traders will talk
about the company management, sales forecasts, and market caps
while ignoring the basic fact that their stock is falling. Technical anal-
ysis will tell you what ’s happening with the stock price, regardless of
what may be transpiring within the company fundamentals. The mar-
ket really does tend to price in the various news and information that
cc1122..iinndddd 224499 1111//22//0077 1122::4477::4400 PPMM



==================================================

250 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
circulates on a company. By focusing on the technical analysis, we
see what people are doing rather than just what they’ re saying. We’ ve
all seen the stock that fell after the analyst upgrade. Only through
the chart analysis will we see that the highs are falling on increasing
volume in spite of the good news that the fi nancial shows may be
feeding us.
If you tend to resist the whole study of technical analysis, as
many skeptical fi rst - time traders and investors do, then think about
it another way. You don ’t need to discard your fundamental research
when you begin to use technical analysis. Think about fundamental
analysis as showing you what to buy or sell and technical analysis as
showing you when to buy or sell.
The alternative danger for the trader is in assigning too much
confi dence in the predictive power of technical indicators. This is
often followed by a relaxing of the rules of risk management. The
logic used is expressed in such phrases as “ I can afford to keep this
position open even though it is moving against me because the (fi ll
in your favorite technical indicator) indicates that the stock will
recover. ” Many very well- intentioned traders spend countless hours
searching for the market equivalent of String Theory: the perfect
algorithm that will allow them to predict future price movement. The
well -k nown lesson of Long- Term Capital Management is that the best
minds and tools must still employ a rigorous risk management disci-
pline. The economist John Maynard Keynes is said to have warned
investors that although markets do tend toward rational positions in
the long run, “ the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay
solvent. ” The power of technical tools is most fully realized when you
understand the inherent limitations of any technical analysis.
The rule of thumb for the trader is this: Use technical indica-
tors in the same way that a drunk uses a lamppost— for support, not
illumination.
4. Risk Management Starts with Stock Selection
Within this book we’ ve devoted an entire chapter to the techniques of
stock screening and selection. A key reason for spending so much time
on the subject is that it is a large factor in mitigating risk. You may be
familiar with the assertion that one could randomly pick stocks and
still make money with a proper money management plan. While we
agree that the position management is a crucial component, we also

Managing Risk 251
recognize that it certainly helps to stack the odds in your favor. It ’s a
simple fact of the markets that momentum will tend to continue until
forces create a reversal. This is a basic tenet of Dow Theory. With that
being the case, wouldn ’t you rather buy a stock in an uptrend than a
downtrend?
Think about this concept another way. There are probably
more than a few of you who have looked at your trading history and
thought, “ If I ’ d only bought when I sold and sold when I bought,
I ’ d be making loads of money by now! ” We’ ve observed that this
is often the result of the never- ending pursuit of the reversal. You
watch a stock drop and think that you’ ll pick the bottom and profi t
from the following bounce. Instead, the stock continues on its free-
fall because it is in a downtrend and money is moving out of the
stock. Stock selection is the discipline of choosing stocks based on
their adherence to your trading strategy, rather than a roll- of - the -d ice
emotional guess.
5. Risk Management Is Non - negotiable
Do you have any non- negotiables in your life? We would certainly
hope that you do. The non- negotiables are those issues, beliefs, and
actions that are not subject to the whims of circumstance. You hold
those items inviolable regardless of what may happen around you.
Risk management should be one of the trader ’s non - negotiables.
It ’s just too easy to come up with creative reasons why this particu-
lar trade is different from the many trades you’ ve done before. Just
about the time you negotiate with yourself and allow yourself a pass
on strictly managing the losses, you fi nd that you’ re in too deep. The
relaxing of the rules that started innocently enough now threatens
your ability to continue trading.
Chatter Box — Rick
I remember when I was a rookie pilot and I fl ew my private plane to
the west coast of Florida to pick up a friend who was visiting for the
week. It was a sunny day, as is usually the case in central Florida, and
the fl ying was terrifi c. Everything went smoothly as I passed south of
Tampa and followed the coastline down to my destination. In no time,

I had reached the airport and was coming in on fi nal approach. As I
descended toward the airfi eld, I trimmed the plane for landing. This
involves setting the control surfaces of the aileron so that the plane
angles downward without as much effort on the controls. I landed
the plane safely and taxied toward the offi ce, where my friend was
waiting.
After a brief stop in the offi ce, we loaded his bags and taxied back
out to the runway for take- off. I brought the plane around to the end
of the runway, applied power, and started my take- off roll. The run-
way faced directly toward the Gulf of Mexico to take advantage of
the headwinds, which assist in lifting the plane during take- off. Just as
I reached the speed at which I needed to lift off, I pulled back on the
controls and felt a heavy resistance. The plane was actually fi ghting
me as I attempted to lift it into the air and we were racing t oward the
open water. In an instant, I realized that I still had the plane trimmed for
landing. Still pulling back on the controls, I reached down and spun the
trim back into the take- off position as we climbed out over the water
and started our trip home.
With fl ying, the take - off and landing checklists are considered
non - negotiables. Had I followed the procedures that I full well knew
I should have followed, there would not have been any problem.
Instead, I acted too quickly without making sure I was following my
risk management plan and I left myself open to trouble. The same
thing happens every day in the fi nancial markets. Traders start
to think they know the routine by heart, and they ignore the rules that
brought them to where they are. Or a trader will think that somehow
this particular trade is unique and should be treated with a little more
fl exibility. Folks, the bottom line is simple: Risk management is a non -
negotiable part of your trading plan.
Risk Management Action Steps
The best theory in the world is just theory until you can fi gure out
how to apply it to real life. This is where the rubber meets the road in
managing risk. Now that you’ ve determined to limit your losses, what
do you do tomorrow when the next trade shows up on your screen?
This list of risk management action steps can be copied to a note
card and taped to the side of your trading monitor. The next time
you ’ re ready to trade, check off the steps in this list:

2. I dentify stocks within the trends.

4. I dentify your stop price.
5. C alculate your position size using the 1% Rule.
6. E xecute your opening trade and stop order.
1. Identify the Market and Sector Trends
The fi rst step in managing risk is to be aware of the environment in
which you’ re trading. You have to know what ’s happening in the mar-
ket and sector that you’ re using as your candidate pool. We just men-
tioned in the previous section that a key point of risk management is
that it begins with stock selection. As part of the selection process, it’ s
important to know what market or sector forces are at work.
If you’ re trading the U.S. markets, your fi rst course of action
should be to chart the Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S& P 500. These
will not always move in tandem, although they do often display
bullish and bearish sentiment together. The simplest way to get a
feel for the broad markets is to plot the ETFs on a simple line chart.
The Dow, Nasdaq, and S& P 500 exchange- traded funds (ETFs) are
DIA, QQQQ, and SPY, respectively. Don ’t get too caught up in the
detailed technical indicators at this stage. If you start at this step
with a market chart covered with fast and slow stochastics, moving
average convergence divergence (MACD) and Fibonacci retrace-
ments, then you’ re probably already overcomplicating the analysis.
The danger when you do that is you lose a sense for the market
direction and get lost in the market noise. Remember, we want
to see where the forest is here, not count how many oak trees the
forest contains.
After putting your fi nger on the pulse of the broad market, drill
down to individual sectors that you’ re considering. If you don ’t
have any specifi c sectors in mind, then you can screen for rising or
falling sectors. For example, if you search for sector ETFs that have
rising 20- day and 50 - day moving averages, the result will include sec-
tors that are in a short- to intermediate - term uptrend. Many basic
web sites include a top 10– style list of ETF performance. These lists
will often display the ETFs with the best returns for the year, for
example. It stands to reason that the ETFs on this list would be
trending upward.

Figure 12.1 Identifying the Broad Market Trends
Figure 12.1 shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (ticker
symbol: DIA) from September 2006 through May 2007. While the
chart is a simple candlestick chart with one intermediate- term mov-
ing average along with volume, it does a very good job of pointing
out the intermediate trends within this broad market. At a glance, we
can identify the three trends; the initial uptrend that carried forward
from early 2006, the channel from November through March and
then the uptrend into May. We don’ t need some complicated analysis
that includes the inverted Christmas tree oscillator to tell us the gen-
eral direction of the market here. (Please don’ t spend too much time
trying to fi nd out about the inverted Christmas tree oscillator!)
2. Identify Stocks within the Trends
Once you have determined the current direction of the market and
the sectors you wish to trade, now it is time to fi nd specifi c stock
candidates. Pay attention to the fact that we state, “ determined the
current direction.” This is a much different analysis than “ deter-
mined where the market is going.” Remember that we don ’t need
to predict the future or develop an opinion about where the market
might be in six months. Our responsibility lies in determining what
forces are at work in the market today.
At this point, you have several choices in fi nding trade candidates.
You could begin by trading the broad market directly through the

index ETF. You could also trade the sector ETF directly if you’ ve found
a sector that is trending according to your strategy. For example, if you
charted the biotech sector (ticker symbol: BBH) and found that it was
in a steady uptrend with good support levels then you may decide to
trade BBH directly. Finally, you could select specifi c stocks within the
sector. To fi nd these stocks, you need only fi nd a list of the stocks that
make up the ETF in question. Some research sites list only the top
holdings within the ETF; others will include the entire list of stocks
within the ETF.
After obtaining a list of the stocks that comprise the ETF, the
next step is to scan the stock charts in the same way we scanned
the market charts in Step 1. The objective is to sort out the stocks
that are not following the trend we’ re after. If the market is trend-
ing upward and the sector is trending upward, we naturally want to
identify those stocks that are also trending upward. There will almost
certainly be individual underperformers within the list and the chart
scan will reveal these to you.
3. Identify Your Entry Price
Now we ’ re ready to take aim at our stock and decide on our point of
entry. Figure 12.2 highlights three possible entry points in the DIA
if we had decided to trade the Dow Jones Industrial Average directly.
These points are not the only possible entry points; we ’ ve selected

them to illustrate some key considerations regarding position entry.
At point A, the stock is in an uptrend and settling on support. How-
ever, the reason we wouldn ’t enter at point A is that the sellers are
in control as evidenced by the black candle. The following day saw
the stock move below the support line for the fi rst time in the chart
window. That should give us pause since it tells us that the buyers are
not holding the support with the same strength as previously.
Point B is our next choice for entry. At fi rst blush, this appears to
be showing strength since the sellers had pushed the stock below sup-
port only to be overcome by the buyers. At the end of the day, the stock
had rallied back above support on strong volume. However, the sell- off
occurred at a level that had been resistance just a few weeks before in
early January. When we see the sellers show that kind of strength at a
key resistance level, we should wait for confi rmation before entering
a new trade. Our caution would have paid off as the next day saw a
continuation of the selling below the moving average support line.
Our third choice is point C, where we see a white candle rest-
ing on support. Notice that this occurs after the stock had rallied
above support and then pulled back to test the moving average
again. Furthermore, the stock closed very near its high for the day
on fairly strong volume. It appears that point C has several positive
factors that would let us buy this stock on the open of the follow-
ing day. Based on the chart, our entry price would likely have been
around $ 44.50.
4. Identify Your Stop Price
Now we need to answer the key question, “ Where am I going to get
out of this trade if I’ m wrong?” If you don’ t answer this question right
up front, you will fi nd yourself in the middle of a mind game, com-
ing up with creative excuses for continuing to hold a losing trade.
The simple rule that you should follow is this: Failure of the reason
you entered the trade should be the reason you exit the trade. In
our example, we bought the stock at point C because it was showing
strength above the support line. Therefore, we need to sell the stock
when it shows weakness below the support line.
If we look at the moving average support in Figure 1 2.2 , it looks
like the line is near the $ 44 mark. But we don’ t want to place our
stop on this line. Why not? By defi nition, support is the level at
which the buyers overcome the sellers and the stock rises again. If

we place the stop order on support, that doesn’ t indicate anything
other than normal, expected movement in the stock. We really
won ’t know that we ’ re wrong unless the stock drops below the
support line. At that point, we can see that the sellers are pushing
the buyers down to new lows and that’ s when we need to exit.
A key question for many beginning traders is, “ How far below
support should the stop be placed?” While there really isn’ t a reli-
able way to quantify that distance, it’ s encouraging to know that your
eye will do a pretty good job with estimating. When you look at how
the stock responds to the support line in the recent chart history, pay
attention to the list below:
• Does the stock drop right to support before bouncing?
• Does the stock penetrate the support during the day before
closing above support?
• Does the stock have a tendency to swing sharply below support
and rally above shortly afterward?
• Does volatility tend to increase (longer candle bodies) or decrease
(smaller candle bodies) as it approaches support?
• Has the support held for a long time, or is it newly established?
The answers to these questions will allow you to develop a sense
for the proper distance below support for your stop. More volatility
in a stock means that you have to give it more room below support.
Otherwise, you’ ll fi nd yourself constantly getting stopped out just as
the stock is ready to bounce.
The entry point C shows a candle that formed a lower shadow,
which touches right on the moving average support. A week earlier,
this support level was the resistance level, giving us a role reversal in
addition to a moving average support. We see also that the moving
average has started trending upward again, so we’ ll place our stop
slightly below the moving average, assuming that the stock will fol-
low this support line as it rises. In this case, let ’s use $ 43.50 as our
stop level. This price is not too close to the moving average, yet it will
show us that the stock has clearly broken the support.
5. Calculate Your Position Size Using the 1% Rule
Are you ready to bring this all together? In our opening example,
we assumed that we have a $ 100,000 trading account. Based on the

1% Rule, we cannot lose more than $ 1,000 on this trade. This maximum
loss number was determined before we ever set eyes on our chart.
Next, we need to determine our risk per share in this trade. The
risk per share is simply the entry price minus the stop price. How’ s
that for easy math? Written as an equation, it looks like this:
(cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:1)
Risk per share $ 44.50 $ 43.50 $ 1.00
Notice that if the stock drops by $ 1, that represents a 2.2 per-
cent drop in the stock. Many people mistakenly think that the stock
can drop only 1 percent according to this rule. That ’s not the case.
The stock may drop by more or less than 1 percent, but the impact
on our trading account is limited to 1 percent.
The last step here is to calculate your position size or how many
shares you may trade. The following equation is used to determine
position size:
(cid:1)
Position size Risk amount / Risk per share
In the example we’ re creating, the position size is found as
follows:
(cid:1) (cid:1)
Position size $ 1 , 000 / $ 1.00 1 , 000 shares
What this tells us is that based on the chart setup that we’ ve
analyzed, we can buy 1,000 shares of DIA at $ 44.50. If it should
drop to our stop level of $ 43.50, we would lose $ 1,000, which is our
maximum loss set by the 1% Rule.
There are two factors that infl uence our position size. The fi rst is
the account value. As the account value increases, the value of 1 percent
of the account increases and vice versa. Second, as the risk per share
increases, the number of shares that we can purchase decreases. This is
how we accommodate the higher risk trades. If we had to purchase this
stock at $ 45.50, our risk per share would have increased to $ 2. Using
the same $ 1,000 maximum loss, we could now buy only 500 shares in
order to stay within our defi ned risk plan.
What happens if we had to buy this stock at $ 53.50? Now we have
a risk per share of $ 10, and we could buy only 100 shares. Some trad-
ers would raise the stop in order to allow them to buy more shares.

Managing Risk 259
This is absolutely the wrong approach because we’ d be placing our
stop above support and we should expect to get stopped out for a loss.
Never tell the market what you need or want; it doesn’ t care. Your
placement of the stop order should be based on the chart alone. If
the trade doesn ’t meet your standard, then go fi nd another trade.
6. Execute Your Opening Trade and Stop Order
It ’s as simple as that; you ’ ve found the trade, now take the risk. How
soon after the opening trade should you place your stop order? Let’ s
list the tasks that may not be done until the stop order is placed:
• Get coffee
• Use the restroom
• Answer the phone
• Sneeze
• Breathe
Are you getting the picture? Once your opening trade is fi lled,
you should immediately enter your stop order. If you give it any more
time, you ’ re just inviting trouble. And, as we’ ve said many times, the
stop order must be physically entered with your broker. Don’ t keep
the infamous mental stop because it has a nasty habit of failing to fi re
when the stop level is reached.
Managing Risk in a Probabilistic World
The issue of managing risk for the trader essentially boils down
to the fact that we are required to take specifi c action in a market that
is probabilistic rather than deterministic. We can make our best-
effort guess at what the future holds, but it can never be known with
certainty. Dr. Lloyd S. Nelson, director of statistical methods for
the Nashua Corporation, is quoted as saying, “ The most important
fi gures that one needs for management are unknown or unknow-
able, but successful management must nevertheless take account
of them. ” Extending that concept to the trading community tells
us that sometimes the most important considerations are not to be
found in the relative strength index (RSI) percentage or whether
the candlestick has a bottom shadow. These may serve as guidelines

for our action, but the analysis is sometimes trumped by factors
beyond our control: an unexpected economic report, litigation
against the company, accounting irregularities, and so on. These are
the trader’ s “ unknown or unknowable, ” but successful trading must
nevertheless take account of them.
Our probabilistic world may not be the most predictable or, at
times, the most profi table. Nevertheless, the lure of the market contin-
ues to reside in the challenge of navigating through the uncertainty.
Navigate with care and you ’ ll be amply rewarded.

Trading Hall of Shame
TRADERS YOU DON’ T WANT TO IMITATE
O
ver the years that we have worked with traders, both new and
experienced, we have seen some personalities emerge. Some traders
exhibited more of these personality characteristics than others. Some
traders captured various characteristics from several personality
types.
We used to joke about the trader who always bought the high and
sold the low. No matter what he tried, he was always on the wrong
side of the trade. That led his fellow traders to consider him a reli-
able contrarian indicator. When the predictable loser would buy, his
fellow traders would all quietly sell. As long as you took the other
side of the trade, profi ts were almost guaranteed.
In the United States, Chapter 13 is the bankruptcy law that allows
for reorganization. Filing a straight bankruptcy forces you into liqui-
dation and does not allow for redeeming yourself. Chapter 13 gives
you the breathing room to recognize the problem and implement
corrective action. If you see yourself in the profi les that follow, then
consider this Chapter 13 to be your path toward reorganization.
In that light, and with perhaps a bit of lightheartedness, we offer
the trader personalities on the following pages. While these char-
acters are fi ctional (for the most part), they really do exist in the
market. Your goal is to make sure you are not one of them. We’ ll
start by describing the characters, including their quirks and trading
habits. Following each character development is the prescription for

Barry the Bottom Fisher: Always Buys the Low
(Until It Makes a New Low)
Barry is the type of person who buys bulk toilet paper because it’ s his
way of getting a bargain. The caption under his high school yearbook
picture reads “ Penny wise, pound foolish” and he still thinks that price
is everything. The truth is he’ ll drive across town to save a penny per
gallon on gas just as quickly as he ’ ll change his broker to save on com-
missions. He is so resistant to paying up for an option contract that the
tattoo on his arm reads “ The further the strike the more I like.”
He is, by far, the most popular guest at the dinner party because
his friends consider him to be the ultimate contrarian indicator. He’ s
even been known to break up a party or two by talking about his trad-
ing positions during the course of a meal. Hosts have since learned
not to schedule any more parties during trading hours as people
will tend to race home to place a trade once they’ ve found out that
they have the same stocks as Barry. He tries hard to convince others
of the favorite trading strategies he’ s learned from long - time buddy
Double - Down Dan, and often wonders why his positions never move
from the average cost basis. It just so happens that Barry is the aver-
age cost basis, and you will fi nd that he holds over a million shares of
stock, but his account equity is still hovering about the $ 12,000 mark.
Barry never has trouble identifying support for his stocks. He simply
uses the bottom of the chart. His trend lines look like the fl ight path
of a homesick groundhog in freefall.
His great grandfather Phil Orkillit just happened to be the author
who introduced the buy and hold strategy in his 1928 best seller, B uy Till
You Die. Feeling confi dent that time is on his side, Barry would never
ever consider using a stop loss order because this would interfere with
his plan to accumulate the position. He will spend many long hours
studying the fundamentals of a company to help him make a buy deci-
sion, and once he is in, he is committed to that stock.

a b argain. There is nothing further from the truth. Of course, there
will be times when you will get lucky and actually be the person who
buys the 52- week low, but in all our years in the market, we have yet
to meet the person who does this consistently.
If your strategy is to “ bottom fi sh ” in the market, then there is
a good chance you have at one point or another, bought a stock,
watched it go down, bought more, and had it go down again; then,
after you ran out of buying power, you grabbed the analyst report
to fi nd reasons why you should hold on to this stock for the long
term. Experienced traders do not trade this way. The great traders
buy high to sell higher. If you fi nd yourself trying to predict the bot-
tom for a stock move, change your approach and make it a point to
only buy a stock that has evidence of a support level and one that is
already on its way up after it has bounced off of the support line.
Another thing you can try in order to change your strategy is to
look for stocks that are in upward trends and try to buy the highs.
This will feel a little uncomfortable for you in the beginning, but
after you have had some success with this, you will feel much better
about it later on.
With regard to shopping for a lower commission, please don ’t
pinch pennies by changing brokers every time the competition low-
ers the cost of a trade. Building a relationship with your broker is a
very important part of your business. If you are a long - time client
who is active in the markets, your broker will be more willing to fi ght
for you the next time you get a bad trade execution. If you ask for
it, there will be times where your broker will give you a customer
service adjustment just to keep you happy (this one piece of infor-
mation could pay for the cost of this book). If you are trading 50
to 120 times per year, you are categorized as an active trader in the
eyes of your broker. Even if you consider yourself to be a long - term
investor, 50 to 100 trades per year make you a very valuable client
who generates revenue for the company you have your account with.
If you left your broker, it could cost them anywhere from $ 2,000 to
$ 10,000 to replace you. You represent a very competitive segment of
the market, and most brokers will fi ght for your business.
Take time and get to know the people you are speaking with on
the phone and shop for good customer service and not a cheaper
commission. Think about it — even if you trade as much as 200 times
per year, is it worth leaving a good company just to save a dollar
or two per trade? We are talking about a $ 200 to $ 400 difference.

Would you trade good service for $ 400? If your answer is yes, then
you are focusing your attention in the wrong direction. A good
broker who gives good service could save you many thousands of
dollars over time.
We have a good time whenever we talk about Barry the Bottom
Fisher because his character is based on a real person who actually
lives in London. Barry has called in to our radio show a few times,
and we are happy to say he has kept a good sense of humor when we

Breakeven Betty: Forget Profits, Breaking
Even Is Her Goal
Fifty - two years old, slightly optimistic, and full of ideas, Betty doesn’ t
embrace success— she absolutely fears it. She drives a hybrid to work
because acceleration frightens her. The bumper sticker on her rear
window reads “ Born to be Mild. ”
Betty is the type of person who so badly wants to be a trader she
can taste it, but somehow she ’s never been able to get in a groove.
Her timing is always just a little off. The stocks she picked in the past
always seemed like good ones at fi rst, but when they turned on her,
she ’ d always fi nd a way to hold on. She loved all of her stocks equally
and maybe that was her problem— she didn ’t quite know how to
let go of them when the price moved against her. When Betty was
younger, she always dreamed of having an only child because she
didn ’t think she could handle sibling rivalries.
Once in a while her friends would come over to visit for some
Reg - T and crumpets. Her trades took on personalities of their own,
with Betty occasionally naming them. Betty ’s friends became her sup-
port group, and they would hold her accountable by asking the tough
questions: “ Why do you like this guy so much? If you hold on any
longer, you are not only going to waste your precious time but also
a lot of money carrying this loser.” Sooner or later, her friends were
right. She would hold on to these guys just long enough to get back the
money she had invested in them, and then she would boot them out.
Prescription
The number one thing we can learn from Betty is that that you should
not marry your stocks. Dump them just as quickly as you would an

abusive relationship. The longer you wait for things to get better, the
worse it will get and the more money it will cost you.
You ’ ll fi nd that the only time Betty sells a stock is when it has
come back up to her entry price. You see, she buys the stock, suffers
all the pain of the crash, and then exits just as it breaks even. That
is often the point when the buyers have regained control, and the
pain is amplifi ed by the fact that Betty watches the stock she just sold
move into a profi t. The fatal fl aw is that Betty buys on the way down
and sells on the way up. That is the exact opposite strategy from the
Market Guys ’ Five Points for Trading Success.
Another rule that is good to follow is this: If you ever fi nd your-
self in a m argin call, the fi rst thing you should do is sell out of the
losing position and move to cash. This is the safest thing to do; then,
once you are in cash, you can always fi nd another stock that will treat
you better. Just because Betty has her broker ’s margin department
on speed dial doesn ’t mean you have to. From our experience, we
have seen that the majority of the time traders will receive a second
and sometimes third margin call after they have deposited funds in
their trading accounts to meet the minimum cash requirement set
by the Federal Reserve Board. If you get a margin call from your
broker, this means your stock is not working out the way you thought
it would. Otherwise, you would be making money from your invest-
ment. If you are holding on to a stock that is collapsing and you give
money to your broker to fi nance this losing position, chances are the
stock will continue in the direction that is hurting you, much like a
bad relationship.

warmest weather he comes with four jackets so he can save seats at

because he ’s heard all the jokes before.
Like Indiana Jones in search of the Holy Grail, he arrives at each
expo with the eager anticipation that this is the event where he will
fi nd the elusive black box for trading. In fact, it’ s been rumored that
he really does carry a whip at the bottom of that schwag bag. He has
never visited a city that doesn ’t have a trading expo because seminars
are his only reason to travel. He is hoping that Kalamazoo will one
day host a trading expo because that’ s where his mom lives.

We meet Seminar Sal at every money show and trader expo. When are
you going to learn that there is no Holy Grail for trading? A good friend
of ours, Martin Pring, has told us that you have bought every book he
has written and he has told you the same, yet you are still searching for
the golden secret. Sal, it’ s time for you to Keep It Super Simple.
It ’s important for us to tell you that there are a lot of good things
you can get from a seminar. The markets will continue to evolve
and you will be able to learn how to trade an exchange- traded fund
(ETF) or you may learn how to correctly invest in a hedge fund, but
at the same time it ’s important for you to know that there are
snake oil salesmen out there who will try to sell you the useless soft-
ware package that will cost you many thousands of dollars. Here are
some pointers that will help you get the most out of a trade show:
• Avoid the impulse buy and don ’t get caught up in the emotion
of the moment. The vendor at the trade show will have little
time to capture your attention; therefore, their approach will
be enthusiastic and one that plays on your emotions. Be aware
of this; make sure you have all of the facts and take the infor-
mation home with you so you can make your decision without
the influence of the enthusiastic salesperson.
• Watch out for false claims. Check the performance record of
anyone who is making income claims. In other words, vet your
source and see if your expert is willing to show you the losing
trades along with the winners. This goes for money managers
as well. Many times, we have seen people just highlighting the

best of show while they ignore the worst performers. Don ’ t fall
for the sales gimmicks.
• Make sure you know your financial objectives before you get to
the show. This will help you get the most of the show, and you will
be able to focus your attention on topics most important to you.
• Get a copy of the speaker schedule and cross off anyone who
uses language that appeals to the person who is looking to get
rich quick.
• Allocate your time and frequent the speakers who showcase
risk management strategies.
• Visit the brokerage firms to see what they are doing to stay
competitive with the other firms. Don’ t focus as much on com-
missions, but rather what they are doing to improve customer
service and availability.
Once you have your trading platform in place, you should be
ready to go. Stick with some basic strategies that will help you stay
consistent in the market and try not to jump from one idea to the
next because this will lead you off on tangents that could distract you
from your most profi table trades.
The Frozen Chosen: Holding Back Because of Fear
As one of the Frozen Chosen, Margarita knows it all, but she can’ t

an effort to help her with her trading problem and found that there
is more to her story than meets the eye. Here are just some of the
notes we took away from our meeting:
• She is difficult to drive with because she tends to want to stop

• She ’s an enthusiastic individual, but one who pays a monthly

• She doesn ’t really care what commissions cost her because
she ’s never paid one.
• She will lose sleep at night over a bad paper trade.
• She has a collection of dice from the craps tables at Vegas

• On her birthday she makes it a point to blow out all but one
candle on her cake, for fear that her wish might come true.
• She has never won the pick - six lottery because she will only
pick five numbers.
• She knows that the early bird catches the worm, but she’ s fear-
ful that she may be the early worm. This may be something
she learned from her father, whose favorite quote was, “ Eagles
may soar, but moles don ’t get sucked into jet engines. ”
• She attempted to place a trade one day, but it scared her half
to death. Now she wonders, “ What happens if you get scared
half to death twice? ”
Prescription
The solution for Margarita is for her to overcome her fears, not just
in trading but in every aspect of her life. This may sound like an easy
thing to do, but if you have conditioned yourself to react to chal-
lenges in a fearful way, this can be a very tough step to take. We are
talking about changing a mind - set, and the only way to reverse this
way of thinking is for you to condition yourself to take action.
From a trading standpoint, the best way to overcome the fear
of the trade is to start small. Buy 50 shares of the stock that you’ re
considering. You may be thinking that it will be diffi cult to make a
profi t on 50 shares. Your goal is not to make a profi t but rather to
overcome your fear of the market. You will fi nd that 50 shares are
easy to manage. You can buy them quickly, sell them quickly, and you
won’ t lose sleep if the stock moves in the wrong direction.
Once you are comfortable with trading 50 shares, move up to
100 shares. Continue building your confi dence until you are ready
to fully implement the Market Guys ’ Five Points for Trading Success
Point IV (The 1% Rule). At that point, you will have the confi dence
to trade 500 or 1,000 shares.
We might also suggest some of the following activities that many
of our friends around the world have found useful:
• Read a short motivational book once a month for a year.
Consider starting with T he Generosity Factor by Ken Blanchard
and S. Truett Cathy (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2002),
or Wins, Losses, and Lessons by Lou Holz (New York: William

• Join a local gym and hire a personal trainer who will push
you to your limits. Exercise is a not only a stress reliever (see
Chapter 7 ), but you will find that it will help you sleep better
at night. Keeping your mind and body strong and rested will
help you make better business decisions.
• Take a self - defense class. You will be amazed to see how well this
builds self- confidence. After you break your first board, you will
feel invincible, and this feeling will eliminate any fears you have
about the world around you.
• Make new friends. Go out there and try to find people who
have qualities you admire. Those who are optimistic, confi-
dent, friendly, and helpful to those around them will most
likely influence the way you evaluate risk. If you surround
yourself with successful people, then your chances of success
become much greater.

It ’s positive, it ’s relaxing, it’ s exciting if you do it right, and,
above all, you will truly be inspired to make good choices not
just in your investments but in your personal life as well. Start
by going to a comfortable, quiet corner in your home or lock
yourself in your car if you have to and just close your eyes and
be still. Be thankful for what you have and relax. Spend time
with your creator and believe in miracles.
• Go out and help someone who really needs your help. Giving
back to the community is a great way to build up your confi-
dence and sense of self- worth. Not only is this rewarding, but
you will be amazed to see just how many people will return
those kind gestures. What goes around comes around.

As a career employee of the consensus bureau, he loves his job

on doors to ask people’ s opinions. When he was a child, his mother
asked him, “ If all of your friends jumped off a bridge, would you
jump, too? ” He meekly replied, “ Yes.”
These days, you will often fi nd Larry putting long hard hours
into his stock research. Although this is done through the late night
chat rooms while on his computer, he does manage to fi nd time for
his closest friends, who happen to be avatars. He tried trading by
himself for a while by going long Coca - Cola, but that position just
fi zzled out. Then he tried buying into the mining equipment sector,
and that idea hit rock before he tried again to trade International

he just decided to give up trying to make decisions for himself.

We know this is corny, but what we have just described to you in

each year. If you fi nd yourself always asking for a second opinion
about a stock you are about to trade, then chances are you are not
willing to take the risk on your own.
Do you take stock tips from your neighbor? Are you always check-
ing the analyst reports to see if they are in line with your positions? If
you wait for everyone else to get into a stock before you get into the
stock, chances are you are on the wrong side of the trade because by
the time you get in, the people who bought fi rst are already thinking
about getting out to take their profi ts. When they sell, who do you
think they will be selling to? Yes, you.
Here is one way you can solve this problem. Instead of following
the crowd, follow the money trail. Get good at reading simple line
charts, and as soon as you see the pivot point that we described in
Point III (Chapter 9 ), buy your stock and soon others will be follow-
ing you instead of the other way around.
Larry is a close cousin to Frozen Margarita, because he trades
with fear, too. That ’s why he always needs to fi nd the consensus. The

Norman Is an Island: Trades in Seclusion, to His
Theme Song, “A ll by Myself ”
As an only child, Norman’ s favorite game was solitaire. You would
often fi nd him riding across town on his unicycle. A skeptic at heart,
he ’s often wondered why psychics have to ask you for your name and
doesn ’t allow anyone to infl uence his own opinion.
He lives in a one- room house at the end of a cul- de - sac, and
when he eats out he makes sure to only use the drive - through win-
dow. Norman is an investor whom the brokerage fi rms would label
“ self - directed,” and his biggest challenge is knowing when to get out
of a stock.
Norman has never been strong on accountability. He assumes
that any association with other traders would simply be a ticket to
passage on a ship of fools. His trading software is direct access, but
Level 1 suits him just fi ne. He has yet to return his broker’ s phone
message asking him if she can help in any way.
Prescription
One of the reasons we see so many people like Norman is the
advancement in technology. It ’s easy to sit at home or in your offi ce
all by yourself at the computer to trade in and out of the markets.
With the click of the mouse you can buy and sell stocks just like the
professionals. But the big difference between your sitting there all
by yourself and the professional is that the professional trader is
not sitting there all by himself. He has many other traders around
him, with a head trader who is keeping a very careful watch on the
risk levels.
If you are like Norman, alone at your computer, who is there to
help you manage the risk? Chances are, nobody is helping you man-
age risk. Norman avoids accountability. This is why we suggest you
try to partner with either your spouse or a friend. Their role is not to
give you a second opinion about the stocks you pick; they are there
to help hold you accountable to the exit points. In other words, if
you buy a stock at $ 25 and you have calculated your stop loss point

to be $ 23, let your partner know that you are getting out at $ 23.
Then ask them to help you track the progress of the stock over time.
If the stock drops to $ 23 or lower, hopefully your friend will let you
know about it. This will be a “ backup ” plan to the stop loss order
you should already have in place.
Please reward your partner every time they help you get out of a
bad position. This will reinforce this behavior pattern, and over time
you may even have trained a good trading buddy, who may one day
be the next great portfolio manager. What you need to do is fi nd
a place that brings you somewhere between Norman and our next
character, who is quite the opposite.
Urgent Carl: He’ s Trading, but He ’s Not Weaned
Carl is willing to make any trade but will not make the trade by
himself. If there were a trader’ s 9 - 1 - 1 line, they would know Carl
by name. Carl needs validation on every stock before he enters the
position, and he has an endless list of questions. Furthermore, when
he gets a trade idea in his mind, the best time to place the trade was
an hour ago. Every minute that passes without the trade is surely
sucking every last penny out of his potential profi ts. Carl lives for the
next market emergency.
Some of the things we noticed about Urgent Carl are:
• He ’s only read part of I ’ m OK, You ’ re OK because he is not
really sure he is okay.
• He is so unsure of his own abilities that he refuses to give him-
self discretionary trading authority in his own account.
• He carries with him a hyperventilation bag for those times
when he can ’t reach his trading coach.
• Armed with the latest and greatest technology, he is a wiz on
the Bluetooth and can spit out a text message in a flash for
instant, quick - response backup support.
• He is actually a very nice guy but is having a hard time fighting
the stalking charges filed by his last trading coach.
• On his account application he listed his personal trading
coach as a codependent.
• By himself he wouldn’ t trade a dollar for a five- dollar bill,
but with the right validation would trade a complex forex
spread.

There is some overlap here with Carl’ s behavior and that of Larry
the Lemming in that they are both validators, but Carl is at least able
to make his own trade decisions. His only problem is that he is quite
unsure of the decisions he is making. To accommodate his lack of
confi dence, he gathers one or more trading coaches around him.
These coaches may be other traders, technical analysts, or fi nancial
advisers. Whoever they are, they become Carl ’s lifeline when his
insecurities rise to a boiling point.
Chatter Box — AJ
There was a time when I was handling a trader who lived in Annapolis,
Maryland. A dentist who loved to trade IBM, he would call me during
the trading day to see how the stock was looking on the technical
charts. I would give a quote to him, he would ask if the stock was still
holding support, and then he would hang up and go back to work.
Five minutes later, my phone would ring again and I would once again
pull up IBM to talk about price support and any news that would come
up on the stock. If you’ ve ever tracked IBM, you know that there are
hundreds of press releases that go out on this company each and
every week, and at times it can be pretty tedious going through all of
those stories to analyze what affect this news will have on the stock.
Well, I had to end our relationship after the day when the number of
inbound calls topped 37 and that was all during the six- and - a - half-
hour trading day. This worked out to be about one call every 11 minutes.
After I ended that relationship, I found out his calls were coming in
between each patient who came to visit him at his offi ce. Needless to
say, this individual was quite unsure of his own ability to manage risk
and needed me to reinforce the risk management plan.
Here are some solutions that will help build confi dence in your
ability to trade the markets without your crutches:
• Start off by trading with a small amount of money in your
trading account. Remember Margarita? This will relieve some

of the stress and get you in a rhythm that will help build a
profitable trading account. Then, once you are in the groove,
you can increase the number of shares according to your com-
fort level and risk tolerance.
• Make sure you are using stop loss orders and accept the fact
that you will be wrong once in a while (maybe even more than
once in a while). Setting your expectations in this way will
eliminate any surprises that will contribute to financial stress.
• Back up your stop loss orders with e- mail alert services that
notify you when a stock drops below key support levels.
• Trade within your education and expertise level. Don’ t trade
options if you don ’t know the difference between a call and
a put.
• Turn off the television. Financial news programs play on the
emotions of investors and will only result in your reacting in a
“ knee jerk ” fashion.
• Don’ t stare at your trading platform every minute of every
trading day. Go out and get a massage and relax. The market
will be there when you get back. Looking at the markets too
much will result in a condition we call “ tickeritis, ” which is a
compulsive disorder causing one to crave stock quotes every
11 minutes.
• Switch to decaf.
By now, you may have picked up on a common trend seen in
several of our characters. Lack of confi dence, low sense of self- worth,
fearfulness, and uncertainty are all factors that will contribute to
making poor fi nancial decisions. Moving on to our last couple, you
will see that this theme continues.
Oz and Trish: The Couple that Vows to
Ignore Any Losing Position
As head- in - the - sand traders, Oz and Trish still believe WorldCom will
come back. They fi nd it curious that most of the stock ticker sym-
bols in their portfolio end with a “ Q. ” They didn’ t actually prepare
for Y2K — they just set their clocks back. Oz was once overheard tell-
ing Trish that stop orders are issued by police for speeding, and he
believes the best way to handle a losing position is to turn off the
computer and go on vacation.

Many people are motivated by various inspirational posters, books,
and tapes. Oz and Trish have a placard hanging above their compu-
ter that reads, “ It Isn ’t a Loss until You Sell It. ” They never made
any trades on margin, so they have the luxury of riding their losing
positions to the bitter end. Neither knew the meaning of the word
asymptotic until a friend once used it to describe the line chart of their
favorite stock.
Oz and Trish are living proof that misery loves company, yet
they have come to a place where they are actually comfortable with
their losing positions. They have always been traders, but somewhere
along the way they morphed into long- term investors as their los-
ing trades accumulated. A common practice of theirs is to sell other
stocks that allow them to take a profi t in order to fi nance the stocks
that are losing money.
Prescription
Oz and Trish live among us more frequently than you might guess.
When we have the opportunity to explain to them what they are
doing wrong, they understand everything we tell them. They are at
the seminars taking copious notes; they hear what we say and know
that it makes complete sense. But when we talk to them days after our
advice was given, to check on what they did to get out of their down-
trending stocks, we see no action taken. It ’s almost as if someone put
a spell on them that causes them to ignore all losses whatsoever.
Whatever you do, don’ t become an Oz and Trish couple. This is
not a strategy to manage risk, and it will never work as a strategy to
profi t in the markets. Imagine if money managers all over the world
ignored risk management ideas. This would be the same as a captain
sailing off toward the open seas knowing that there were holes in the
bottom of his boat and not doing anything to plug the holes.
This type of a mind- set is a very tough one for us to overcome
because it is based on a strong belief that says out of sight, out of
mind and eventually things will get better. Remember that it takes
only one bad investment to blow up your whole portfolio. The fol-
lowing points are things you should think about to avoid getting
your head stuck in this ostrich approach to trading:
• Create a lot of pain in your mind in “ not taking action. ” Think
of what could happen if this stock does not turn around. What
will this do to your finances?

• Print charts of stocks you own and draw red lines where
support levels are and keep them in an obvious place near
your computer so you can ’t run and hide from the truth.
• If on your last try to manage your risk, you still fail to face the
truth and get out of a losing trade, we have no other advice
than to seek professional help in managing your portfolio. It
would be better to pay one or two percentage points to have a
licensed financial adviser do the job than for you to risk your

It ’s Funny Until It Hurts
We had a lot of fun writing this chapter because humor sometimes
helps us to remember key points of interest. Poking fun at ourselves
every now and then is okay as long as we are not offending anyone in
the process. However, if you did take offense to any of the comments
we ’ ve made regarding our characters, you should take a serious look
at yourself, as it may suggest you have a “ nonprofi t profi le. ”
Although we did base our stories on real people, we were sure
not to use their real names. If you happen to have the same name as
one of our characters, we assure you this was purely a coincidence.
In our next chapter we are going to talk about how to fi nd a good
broker. Once you have found a broker that can help you, be sure to
build a relationship with the people you speak with from that fi rm.
After you get to know some of the active trader representatives who
handle your account, be sure to ask them if they have ever run into
Barry, Betty, or Sal. If they haven ’t , there is a good chance they’ ve
spoken with Margarita, Larry, or Norman. Carl will be blocked from
calling them anymore, and Oz and Trish would never call them for
help because they will be on vacation. It would be interesting to get
their views on the types of traders they speak with each and every day
while the markets are open for trading. Chances are they will have
crazier stories than we do.

o what does your broker personal ad look like? Have you consid-
ered what features and characteristics your broker should have to
meet your needs? Or do you think that all brokers are created equal
and fi nding the right one is not much more than a crap shoot? In
this chapter, we’ ll give you some guidelines on fi nding a broker who
can help you execute your trading plan. The following top ten list
will help you fi nd the perfect broker mate!
1. Accounts
When we talk about account types and considerations, we recognize
that the rules and choices vary by location and changes in laws. A retire-
ment account in the United States will have different contribution and

distribution restrictions than a similar Canada account. Nevertheless,
we want to at least provide some framework for what to look for in your
accounts. We will introduce accounts with a review of the following:
• Brokerage
• Retirement
• Custodial
• Ownership considerations
Brokerage
You need to ensure that the broker you choose can service the types
of accounts that you need for your trading and investing plan. The
most basic brokerage account will allow you to buy and sell stocks,
bonds and mutual funds. Generally, there is a minimum deposit
required which varies between brokers. A typical minimum for many
fi rms is $ 5,000, although some require less for the initial deposit.
One of the reasons that brokers require the minimum balance is
to provide a buffer in the event that you buy a stock and it drops in
price. The broker needs a cushion to absorb the losses; otherwise,
the fi rm is on the hook for the losses.
Adding margin to the account requires a separate application, which
must be completed by all account owners. Margin gives you the fl exibil-
ity to buy stocks with borrowed funds and is also necessary for short sell-
ing. You cannot sell short in an account that does not have the margin
feature. It ’ s important to note that the margin agreement that you sign
gives the broker the right to sell any of your holdings in the account
in the event that you experience a maintenance call. The mainte-
nance call is issued when you purchase a stock on margin (borrowed
funds) and the stock price drops to a certain level, known as the house
maintenance requirement. In this instance, the fi rm will require the
deposit of additional funds to increase the buffer. If they cannot reach
you, they have the right to liquidate any of your positions in order to
increase the cash balance of the account. We’ ve known traders who
thought they could escape this action by ignoring their broker’ s calls.
Retirement
Retirement accounts are special accounts that are available in the
United States and many other countries which provide advantages for
cc1144..iinndddd 227788 1111//22//0077 11::4433::2299 PPMM

Going to the Dance 279
retirement savings. There are many various structures and regulations
regarding these accounts so we won’ t discuss account- specifi c details.
However, most of the retirement accounts have some common char-
acteristics.
Retirement accounts are generally structured to lean toward
conservative strategies and investments. For that reason, short sell-
ing is forbidden because the potential for unlimited risk is consid-
ered unacceptable for a long- term account. Also, most brokerage
fi rms restrict the types of option trades that may be executed within
a retirement account. Selling uncovered calls that could place the
seller into a short position is a type of trade that would be prohib-
ited. Some types of retirement accounts restrict the choice of invest-
ment products, providing only a limited menu of mutual funds from
which to choose. Others, such as self- directed accounts, allow you
to choose from most available investment products, including indi-
vidual stocks and options.
Retirement accounts are designed to encourage saving for the
long- term and so they generally provide a tax advantage to the account
owner. Since tax laws can change at any time, our recommendation is
to meet with your broker or tax advisor to determine which specifi c
retirement account best matches your objectives.
Custodial
Custodial accounts are designed to help you save for the needs
of a minor child. The savings may be general in nature or geared
toward a specifi c objective such as education. Once again, the laws
and restrictions vary between countries and individual brokers.
Much like retirement accounts, custodial accounts provide certain
tax advantages and may or may not restrict the types of investments
available to you. Custodial accounts often have a lower initial deposit
although that usually is attended by limits on annual contributions.
Ownership Considerations
Ownership of an account is divided into three primary categories:
individual, joint, or corporate. An individually owned account is held
by one person who makes the trading and investing decisions. The
individual owner is the only one authorized to withdraw funds or
make changes to the account. A retirement account is a typical
example of an account that would be owned by one person. It is

==================================================

280 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
possible for an individual owner to designate another individual as
an a uthorized trader but that would not affect the actual ownership
of the account.
Jointly owned accounts are typical of brokerage and savings
accounts. Often, married partners will open joint accounts that allow
both partners to individually access account records, make trading
and investing decisions, and withdraw funds. Jointly owned accounts
also provide for the effi cient transfer of ownership and authority to
the surviving partner on the death of one owner.
Corporate accounts may be held by any for- profi t or nonprofi t
organization. These account types are typically held by trading clubs,
where the club members pool their funds for trading. Buy and sell
decisions are made according to club procedure and the trades are
executed within the corporate account. It is common practice to des-
ignate certain corporate offi cers or representatives as having trading
and fund withdrawal authority. You can only imagine what the result
would be if a trading club allowed all members to access the available
funds at any time without accountability. Once the members realized
the access they had to free funds, they’ d be grabbing at the money
like drunken sailors on shore leave.
2. Advice and Support
One question that you need to answer in the process of selecting a
broker is, “ How much help will I need along the way?” Some traders
and investors wish to be left completely alone and use their broker as
an execution venue only. They don’ t want advice or any solicitations.
There are no - frill, low - cost fi rms that cater to these individuals. Most
traders and investors desire and need some level of assistance and
there are brokers who fi t in at every level.
The dot- com era saying about bricks and clicks is one considera-
tion in selecting your broker. Does your broker have a retail location
where you can walk in and actually speak face to face with your repre-
sentative? Brokers don’ t have the numbers of retail locations as banks,
and that ’s why there are still many people who open their trading and
investment accounts with a local bank. Some large online brokers
have retail offi ces in major cities. Other online brokers have elected
to not open any retail locations and provide all support through
call centers. Almost all brokers, with or without retail locations, give
you access to representatives by phone. Many also have a premium

support group for clients who are active traders or who maintain a
large account balance.
For a long time, online brokers would provide transaction- based
services only. You could trade, transfer funds, print records, and per-
form other tasks but they wouldn’ t offer any guidance on planning
or strategies. On the other side of the coin, full- service advisers were
especially reluctant to let you make any trades on your own. The
investor was left in an either- or situation. Today, many online bro-
kers have varying levels of advice and support. At one end of the
spectrum is on - demand assistance for the self- directed trader who
only needs some occasional help. Next along the line is the valida-
tor, who makes her own decisions but she wants a sanity check from
a professional. At the far end of the spectrum is the delegator, who
wants someone else to make the buy and sell decisions based on an
agreed -u pon overall strategy. Many of the full- service, fee- based advis-
ers prefer that the client not trade within the managed account. For
that reason, more traders who have professionally managed invest-
ment accounts are now opting to open a separate trading account
with an online broker.
One key area of support that is often overlooked is technical and
trade support. This is particularly crucial as you begin to trade more
actively. There are few things more annoying, or more costly, than
trading in a fast market and having your trading software freeze or
not receiving a trade confi rmation quickly enough to let you know
where you stand in the position. In times like these, you need to
be able to pick up the phone and reach a support representative
quickly. If your broker can ’t deliver timely information backed up by
a responsive call team, then it ’s time for you to fi nd another broker.
3. Trading and Investing Products
The basics of the trading and investing products may be found at
just about every brokerage fi rm. Let ’s start with the basics and then
talk about some others.
Most of us think about stocks when we talk trading. Trading
stocks is the bread and butter of most retail traders. However, there
are other aspects of stock trading besides just pressing the buy and
sell button. You should consider whether your broker provides an
institutional desk for large lot orders. These representatives will take
a large lot order and work it into the market to minimize the impact
cc1144..iinndddd 228811 1111//22//0077 11::4433::3300 PPMM



==================================================
                     PAGE 301                     
==================================================

282 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
of your order on the stock price. Also, if you trade penny stocks, or
the pink sheets, consider whether your broker will allow you to trade
these online. The term pink sheet comes from the fact that the prices
of these cheap stocks were originally printed on pink paper.
Mutual funds are familiar to most investors today and there are
literally thousands to choose from. More fi rms are now offering a wide
selection of no- load, no - transaction - fee mutual funds. You need to
look carefully at the loads and expenses associated with mutual funds
and ensure that you ’ re not overpaying for underperformance. Index
funds are a great way to track the markets with very low fund expenses.
Because many mutual funds include a short - term redemption fee,
they are considered investment products rather than trading products.
Funds are priced once a day at the net asset value (NAV). Your broker
should be able to provide you with the NAV and complete fund infor-
mation for all of the funds they offer. In this category, we also include
exchange -t raded funds (ETFs). Since ETFs trade the same as stocks,
they are available to trade through almost all brokers. However, not all
brokers provide you with ETF - specifi c research tools.
Options are one of the fastest growing segments of the markets
today. As a trader, you should be on the lookout for a broker that lets
you research and trade options. Unless you are in the most advanced
segment of traders, the basic option information will be adequate for
your trading. This includes the full option chain with Greeks (how
an option price changes) and the ability to place simple and complex
option orders. Some of the advanced specialized options brokers
offer much more complex trading systems geared exclusively toward
the advanced trader. For those who trade at the advanced level, this
could be useful. For the majority of the traders who do not, this could
lead to analysis paralysis.
Bonds and cash products are important investments that pro-
vide stability and growth in your account without the same type and
level of risks that come with equity investments. We never recom-
mend trading with your entire portfolio and, therefore, you need
other investments to balance your trading activity. A good broker
will let you search for bonds, certifi cates of deposit (CDs), or other
high -y ield cash securities. Some of these will require that you hold
the investment until maturity in order to avoid an early withdrawal
penalty.
Looking at some of the more advanced products, you can con-
sider trading futures. Many futures brokers will let you trade futures

Going to the Dance 283
on multiple exchanges for products such as commodities, currencies,
interest rates, metals, market indexes, and energy. Often, a futures
account will have a higher minimum initial deposit than a standard
brokerage account because of the leverage associated with futures
trading. Other products that are available in various locations are
contracts for difference (CFDs), spread betting, and forex. You need
to be careful to understand the increased risks that may come with
the advanced derivative products and choose a broker who will pro-
vide support as you may need it.
4. Costs and Fees
Everyone looks at commissions so we’ ll start with this one, even
though commissions have dropped to the point that they’ re almost
a nonissue. It wasn ’t all that long ago that a 1,000 share purchase
of a blue - chip stock could set your account back hundreds of dollars
from the trade commission. Today, most brokers are hard- pressed to
justify a commission above $ 20 for a stock trade and many are less
than $ 10. Option trades are priced at a base commission plus a per -
contract fee. If you trade actively, you should look for a broker who
will further discount your commission based on your trading activity.
Some brokers also offer a bundle of free trades when you open a
new account or deposit additional funds. Any time you bring a value
to your broker, you should consider how they might be able to offer
you a value in return.
Another fee that is not quite as visible as the commission is the
margin interest rate that you pay on margin balances. This is noth-
ing more than the cost of borrowing money from your broker. How-
ever, in the same way that you may shop around for the best home
mortgage, you should also shop for the best margin rate if you tend
to trade with margin. These rates are often pegged to the prevailing
interest rate, but just as with commissions, margin rates are often
discounted for active traders or high- balance accounts. On the fl ip
side of the margin fee is the yield that is paid on cash balances. You
should pay close attention to this because a low yield may act as a sur-
rogate fee if you maintain cash in your account. The return you get
on your money is a function of costs and earnings. Low earnings can
have just as bad an effect on your account as high costs.
Account fees can quickly add up if you don’ t pay attention to
them. Ask your broker about the charges they impose for certain

account types, minimum balances or high transaction activity. You
should look for a broker who will consider all of your accounts as
a household and not assess fees to each account separately. It’ s ter-
ribly frustrating to have a trading account where you may be trading
50 times a month and paying $ 10 trade commissions, only to have
a separate account where you’ re paying $ 20 trade commissions
because you don ’t trade often enough.
You need to consider how various transaction fees are charged
to your account and fi nd a broker who can help you minimize these
costs. It is becoming more common for brokers to reimburse you
for ATM fees when you withdraw funds from your account, even if
the ATM machine is not on your home network. Other transaction
fees to consider are wiring, checking, option exercise and assign-
ment, stop payment, mail and processing, records and statements,
and verifi cation of deposit. As you can see, the menu of fees can be
quite extensive, and you need to determine which ones may affect
you and which broker keeps these costs down.
5. Software
Software for trading and investing is becoming more important as the
fl ow of information has shifted from the realm of the professionals
toward the average retail trader like you and me. Market software
generally falls into two categories: web-based software and stan-
dalone packaged software.
Web - based software is built into the broker’ s web site and is acces-
sible from any web connection. As a rule, web- based software tends
to be simpler than the stand - alone packages since it is used by the
majority of traders and investors, particularly those with less experi-
ence. There are a few features that you should look for in the web-
based software offered by your broker.
First of all, every web application should have some level of chart-
ing. This is a must. If your broker doesn’ t offer basic stock charts,
move on. The charting package is all the better if you can add trend
lines, moving averages and volume, at the least. It is also nice if you
can add some level of customization to the chart such as varying time
views and different charting styles. Most web software applications
include real - time quotes, as delayed quotes are available to the gen-
eral public on almost all fi nancial sites. Along with the quotes, you

should be able to access various stock statistics such as daily range,
volume, current bid/ask and 52- week high. You should also have full
access to your account information including balances, transaction
history and positions with gain/loss reports.
Web software usually lags stand - alone software from an active
trading standpoint. However, for the investor, web software is usu-
ally the better choice. Web applications are usually more complete
for products such as bonds and mutual funds, for both research
and trading. Furthermore, because many of the transaction func-
tions such as banking and bill paying are done through the web, it
is easier to integrate all of the account activity through a web- based
platform.
Standalone software applications usually come in the form of a
Java application or proprietary code that resides on your local com-
puter. These packages are specifi cally designed to address the needs
of the active trader and include more advanced analysis and execu-
tion functions than the web applications. There are myriad features
within the stand- alone applications, but we’ ll review some of the
more common features to aid you in your decision here.
• Charts. A solid charting capability is a must- have for any stand -
alone application. The bare minimum features that we would
consider for the more advanced software is the three major
chart styles (line, bar, candlestick), trend lines, moving aver-
ages, volume, scalability, and color/font customization. The
latter feature is important because (1) a chart that is easy on
your eyes will allow you to read it better, and (2) this feature is
so easy to code there ’s no reason for a broker not to have it.
• Screening tools. There are many types of screening tools from
preset screens to programmable screens. We prefer to have
the flexibility to create our own screens based on criteria that
we select. However, any trading platform should include top
gainers, top losers, top volume and a high/low list. Remember
that selecting a stock is one of the key parts of managing risk,
so if you can’ t screen for your stock, you’ re starting with an
unnecessary level of risk.
• Option data. Some people might disagree with us on this point,
but we think that you should have access to basic option chain
data even if you’ re not trading the option. As option trading

286 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
continues its explosive growth, you ’ ll find that option expira-
tion day, open interest, and other option- specific terms become
more important to every trader. Of course, if you are trading
options, the full call/put chain, Greeks, volume, and open
interest are the least you should expect from your broker.
• Stock data. Once the exclusive domain of the professional day
trader, the Level 2 screen is now an expected part of the stock
data on advanced platforms. This gives you visibility into the
price levels other than the high bid and low offer. You also
get to see how the stock has traded for the day as well as the
current trading ticker. Most of these platforms include direct
access, which lets you route your order to any market partici-
pant. Even with direct access, we find that the intelligent order
routing systems employed by the major brokers are sufficient
for most orders.
• Watch lists. The Market Guys actually consider this to be a mini-
mum requirement for advanced trading platforms because it
supports the stock screening function. Many times, we ’ ll find a
stock that is setting up very nicely for a trade but it ’s not quite
at the entry point yet. The best course of action is to place it
on a watch list and review it each day until the entry point is
reached or it fails to complete the setup, in which case we’ ll
remove it from the watch list.
• Real - time account and order status. What can we say here except
that you can’ t manage your trades if you don’ t know where
you stand? You should have instant access to your account
equity, buying power, and open positions. Each open posi-
tion should have real - time profit and loss updates. Perhaps
the most important is the order status, letting you know if an
order is open, filled, or partially filled. Sometimes the markets
move rapidly and you need to take action. It’ s at these critical
times that you need your software to work for you rather than
against you.
You may certainly have more features that you consider critical
to your trading. That ’s fi ne. Our goal in this list is to help you think
about the features that we use and that you may want to also con-
sider. Depending on what you trade, your experience level and your
time horizon for trading, there are many other tools and features
that you ’ ll want to review on a case - by - case basis.

6. Order Types
Traders today need the ability to execute trades according to their
strategy and market conditions. Your broker should give you the
ability to place the following trades as conditions warrant.
Market
The market order is an order that goes to the market and tells every-
one that you want to trade and are not concerned primarily with
price. A market buy order will usually fi ll on the offer or ask price
while a market sell will usually fi ll on the bid price. The market order
guarantees execution but not price. A limitation of the market
order is that it will only execute while the market is open. Low liquid-
ity and large spreads would make the market order dangerous to
use during the pre - and post - market trading hours.
Limit
The limit order is used when you want to specify a maximum buying
price or a minimum selling price for your order. A limit buy order is
always placed below the current trading price while a limit sell order
is always placed above the current trading price. While the market
order guarantees execution but not price, the limit order guarantees
price but not execution. If you place a limit buy order below the
market and the stock never falls to your limit price, your order will
remain open and unfi lled. Limit orders may be placed at any time
and may be fi lled while the market is closed since any fi ll that meets
your limit price is a valid trade.
Stop
The stop order is a little tricky for new traders to understand some-
times but it is really a simple order. The buy stop order is used to buy
a stock when the price rises; therefore, the buy stop order is always
placed above the current market price. The sell stop order is used to
sell a stock when it falls; therefore, the sell stop order is always placed
below the current market price. Notice how the limit sell and the
buy stop are both above the current trading price while the limit buy
and the sell stop are both below the current trading price.
Let ’s use one example to illustrate the stop order. If you own
a stock and you want to sell it if it starts to fall, you would protect
cc1144..iinndddd 228877 1111//22//0077 11::4433::3311 PPMM



==================================================
                     PAGE 307                     
==================================================

288 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
your open position with a sell stop. The sell stop will just sit in your
account only until the stock drops to the stop price that you specify.
When the stock hits your stop price, the sell stop order automatically
turns into a market sell order and your position would be closed at
the current market price.
It is possible to combine a stop order with a limit order to create a
stop limit order. The stop limit order requires that you specify both
a stop price as well as a limit price. Let’ s see how this would work
for protecting a stock that you own. Let’ s say you own a stock that is
trading at $ 50. You decide that you want to sell it if it drops to $ 47;
however, you really don ’t want to sell it for less than $ 45. In this case,
you would place a sell stop limit order with a stop at $ 47 and a limit
at $ 45. If the stock drops to $ 47, the sell stop limit order would auto-
matically convert to a limit sell. Here’ s the problem, though. If the
stock is falling rapidly, it is possible that the stock price could drop
below your limit price before your order is fi lled. In that case, you
would own a falling stock without any protection. For that reason,
if you ’ re using a stop order to protect an open position, we always
recommend that you use a stop rather than a stop limit.
Trailing Stop
This one is a handy twist to the standard stop order. The biggest
limitation to the stop order is that it will protect the stock you own
from falling, but it doesn’ t help you protect your profi ts. The trail-
ing stop accomplishes both. The trailing stop is a stop order that
will continually adjust the stop price in the direction of profi ts. In
other words, if you own a stock and it starts to rise, the trailing stop
will rise along with the stock price, thereby increasing the level at
which the stop order will execute. The stop order, therefore, trails
behind the trading price and will follow it until the stock starts to
retreat, at which point the stop order will sell your stock and lock in
the majority of the profi t.
This is another one that is best understood with real numbers. Sup-
pose you buy a stock for $ 50 and you want to limit your loss to $ 2 per
share. At the same time, you want to lock in your profi ts as the stock
rises. You could place a $ 2 trailing stop, which would set the initial
stop price at $ 48. Now assume that the stock price moves from $ 50 to
(cid:1)
$ 54. The stop price would automatically increase to $ 52 ( $ 54 $ 2).
Next the stock price increases to a maximum of $ 57.33. The stop

==================================================
                     PAGE 308                     
==================================================

Going to the Dance 289
price is now at $ 55.33. At this point, the stock starts to fall and when it
reaches $ 55.33, the trailing stop turns into a market sell and you exit
your trade for a $5 .33 profi t.
Contingent
We would not necessarily consider these orders as a hard require-
ment, but they sure do make trading life easier. A contingent order
is any order that will execute when a specifi ed condition is met. For
example, let ’s say that you wanted to buy a stock based on volume
rather than price. If the volume of the stock reaches 1 million shares,
you want to buy the stock because that would be an indication of
rising interest. A contingent order would let you create a market
buy order that only executes if and when the daily volume crosses
1 million shares.
Another example would be a sell collar. Suppose you own a stock
and you want to sell it for a minor loss if it drops or sell it for a profi t if
it reaches your price target. You cannot place two active sell orders on
one position so you would create a collar. This type of contingent order
is called a one- cancels -o ther (OCO) order. Both of the sell orders would
be active, but as soon as either one is executed, the other instantly can-
cels. That prevents you from executing two sell orders for one position,
which would otherwise leave you in a short position.
7. Research
While we tend to focus more on the technical analysis as traders,
we don ’t suggest that you give up doing any fundamental research.
There are many aspects of the underlying company, sector, indus-
try, or economy that are worth exploring as you prepare for and
manage your trades and investments. Fundamental research also is
increasingly important as your time horizon lengthens. Of course,
a day trader probably wouldn ’t do any fundamental analysis, but a
long - term investor needs to understand the company data more than
today ’s trading data. We’ ve compiled a list of standard research that
you might look for from your broker.
• Earnings data. Earnings data is one of the highest profile news
events that is released by a company. Your broker should provide
you with the earnings date, estimates, and all reports and f ilings
cc1144..iinndddd 228899 1111//22//0077 11::4433::3322 PPMM



==================================================
                     PAGE 309                     
==================================================

290 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
related to earnings. This should be fully accessible through
your broker ’s web site when you log in to your account. Many
traders pay particular attention to the date that earnings are
announced because trading volatility can increase dramatically
shortly before and after an earnings announcement.
• News. Most brokers will provide news from at least two or
three separate news feeds. A useful feature of any news feed
is the ability to filter for keywords. If you own IBM stock,
it is especially helpful to enter the keyword I BM into the fil-
ter and see only those headlines that affect your company.
Likewise, you may be targeting the energy sector in which
case you might filter for keywords such as e nergy, OPEC, or o il
futures.
• Company profile. You should ensure that your broker provides
you with the full company profile information including mar-
ket cap, shares outstanding, short interest, price- to - earnings
ratio (P/E), ex- dividend date, and beta. You should also be
able to check key ownership by corporate officers and major
shareholders. Along with the ownership, it is helpful to see
what the insider buying and selling activity looks like. Keep in
mind, though, that insider transactions are not real time, they
are reported monthly.
The accounting reports are a standard part of the company
profi le. These include the balance sheets, income statements,
cash fl ow statements and Securities and Exchange Commission
or other regulatory body fi lings. Once again, keep in mind that
the trader should watch price and volume fi rst, because there
is often a divergence between the company f undamentals and
the price, especially over the short term.
• Education and training. We consider this to be part of the
research because it is part and parcel with empowering you
as the trader or investor. Your broker should not be afraid to
enable you to be a more informed client. Many brokers pro-
vide online tutorials for their products and services to help
you navigate through the choices. The best brokers are those
who actually offer education and training classes where you
can attend and direct questions to the trainers. If your broker
offers these classes, don’ t underestimate the value that you ’ ll
receive from taking your knowledge up a notch.

8. Banking
If you want to integrate your trading and investing with your banking,
then consider a broker who offers various banking features through
your brokerage account. While there can be many advantages from
bringing your brokerage and banking accounts together, the biggest
drawback for many people is the loss of a local, personal banker. To
accommodate that concern, you could maintain a backup savings or
checking account at a neighborhood bank with a small portion of
your portfolio. Consider the following list when looking for a broker
who could take care of your banking requirements.
• Checking and ATM. Checking and ATM access are right at the
top of the list in the banking checklist. The key details to look
for here are the fees associated with various transactions. In
order to stay competitive, many brokers are offering unlimited
ATM withdrawals from any ATM. As we mentioned earlier, the
broker will credit your account for ATM fees incurred when
withdrawing funds from an off- n etwork ATM. On the checking
side, consider how many checks you write each month and be
sure your broker will not charge you for exceeding a monthly
check limit.
• Loans. Home, car, and boat loans are the current product focus
for many brokers. It only makes sense. They’ re holding your
investments, so they ’ ve already evaluated your financial situa-
tion. As a rule, clients who have trading and investing accounts
tend to be a bit more financially established than the average
Joe on the street that walks into the neighborhood bank for a
car loan. The brokers know that there is a steady revenue stream
that comes from issuing high- quality loans so they ’ re going to
be courting you when you ’r e looking to borrow money. The
shopping list here is the same that you would use for a bank
loan. Interest rate and loan terms are what it ’s all about.
• Bill pay. The bill- paying feature is a convenience that many of
us choose to not live without anymore. You can pay your bills
online through a recurring schedule and not have to worry
about stamps, envelopes, and missing payment deadlines. If
you haven’ t used bill pay yet, then look into this when you’ re
checking into brokers.

==================================================

292 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
• Wiring and fund transfers. Most people rarely use their broker
for wiring funds, but when you need that service, you’ ll be
thankful for a broker who makes the process easy for you.
Check into the fees charged for wiring and how your broker
processes the wires. Make sure you understand the cutoff time
for sending a wire out. Your broker should also be clear to help
you with funds tracking when a wire is sent or received.
More often, when you have multiple accounts with one
broker, you’ ll want to be able to transfer funds quickly between
accounts. Your broker should allow you to do this online and
provide transfer confi rmation immediately. This feature is an
integral part of cash management that will enable you to earn
the greatest return on your deposited cash. Move funds into
checking or trading accounts as you need them, but keep the
cash in high - yield cash accounts when the funds are idle.
• Credit cards. We’ r e not sure this is a hard requirement for select-
ing a broker since getting a credit card these days is about as
easy as falling off a chair. Nevertheless, many brokers offer a
branded credit card or, alternately, a debit card tied to your
brokerage account.
9. Reports and Records
Most people don’ t think very much about how good their broker is
with reports and records until tax day rolls around. Then you fi nd
yourself scrambling for your cost basis, transaction history, or trade
confi rmation and wonder how you’ ll ever fi nd the information. Bro-
kers generally provide the information through online access or
archive retrieval. The former is usually offered for free or for a nomi-
nal fee. The latter requires more handling by the broker and, there-
fore, you can expect to pay for the service as you request documents.
Our suggestion is that you focus on the online reports and records
and fi nd a broker who will provide this information without cost.
• Transaction history. When did that check that you wrote to the
charity clear? What was the date of deposit for the gift check
you received for your birthday? How many times did you pay
the builder by check? These are the kinds of questions that
you want answers to and you want the answers now. Having

                     PAGE 312                     
==================================================

Going to the Dance 293
online access to your account transaction history is a fact of
life these days and your broker should accommodate this eas-
ily. An added benefit is the ability to search or sort through the
transactions. For example, you might want to find all check
deposits between July and October. Or you want to reorder
the history list so that all of the checks come first, followed by
deposits, and so on.
• Trading activity. As a trader, you’ ll need the ability to know
exactly what you traded and when. Look for a broker that
lets you search through your trading activity for opening and
closing prices, date of trade, how many shares were filled at
each price level, time of trade, and other information that you
would see on your trade confirmation. You’ ll also want to see
a record of orders so that you know which orders filled and
which orders expired or were canceled. At the end of the
trading year, all of this information should be available in a
consolidated report to help you with your tax reporting.
• Gain/loss. The gain/loss report is a great way to track your prog-
ress on both your trades and investments. The data for this
report should be captured automatically for any trades that
you place through your broker. As you open a new position,
the opening price (or average opening price for multiple fills)
is compared against the current market price to let you know
your position profit or loss. The report also tallies up all open
positions to give you a cumulative profit or loss for the account.
If you transfer open positions in to your broker, provide them
with the cost basis for your transfer positions and the gain/loss
report should be able to track the ongoing performance.
• Account records. This is one report that is usually not available
online but that’ s okay because you should rarely have a need
for it. The account records include copies of such items as your
account applications, powers of attorney, options approval,
and written authorizations or instructions. These records are
usually required for litigation or estate settlement, for exam-
ple. While your broker should make these available to you,
expect to pay a retrieval and processing fee for each document
requested.
• Data downloading. There are a number of good third -p arty soft-
ware packages on the market now that let you manage your
own records and reports. Search for a broker that will let you

==================================================

294 The Market Guys’ Five Points for Trading Success
download your transactions periodically into your own com-
puter. Once you have your hands on the data, you can create
your own tax reports or gain/loss reports. We know many trad-
ers who include these reports as a part of their trading plan
and diary to track their growth and progress. You’ ll appreciate
not having to connect to your broker every time you want to
see where you stand.
10. Security
Security considerations for selecting a broker generally fall into two
categories: fund security and account security. Fund security refers
to the safety of your assets held by the broker. This is a function of
the health of the brokerage fi rm overall. Account security deals with
issues related to fraud. A breach of either one can be a nightmare
for you, so be sure you understand what protection your broker has
in place.
Fund Security
You may have seen the sticker in the corner of the window when you
walked into your broker’ s offi ce. Chances are your broker is a
member of one or more of the regulating or insuring bodies. Of
course, these organizations will differ among various countries, so
we ’ ll discuss the primary bodies within the United States and you
can look for the counterpart if you’ re doing business outside of the
United States.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) maintains the
stability and public confi dence in the U.S. fi nancial system by insur-
ing deposits and examining and supervising fi nancial institutions.
Savings, checking, and other deposit accounts, when combined, are
generally insured to $ 100,000 per depositor in each bank the FDIC
insures. Deposits held in different categories of o wnership —s uch as
single or joint accounts — may be separately insured. Also, the FDIC
generally provides separate coverage for retirement accounts, such
as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keoghs, insured up to
$ 250,000.
Investors and traders should look for the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC). When a brokerage fi rm is closed
cc1144..iinndddd 229944 1111//22//0077 11::4433::3344 PPMM

Going to the Dance 295
due to bankruptcy or other fi nancial diffi culties and customer assets
are missing, the SIPC steps in as quickly as possible and, within cer-
tain limits, works to return customers’ cash, stock and other securi-
ties. Without SIPC, investors at fi nancially troubled brokerage fi rms
might lose their securities or money forever or wait for years while
their assets are tied up in court. SIPC has limits of $ 500,000 per inves-
tor with a maximum of $ 100,000 cash.
One of the self- regulatory organizations (SROs) that oversees the
brokerage industry is the National Association of Securities Dealers
(NASD). The NASD reviews the activities of nearly 5,100 brokerage
fi rms, about 171,000 branch offi ces, and more than 663,000 regis-
tered brokers. They oversee and regulate trading in equities, corpo-
rate bonds, securities futures, and options. The NASD operates the
largest securities dispute resolution forum in the world, processing
over 4,600 arbitrations and nearly 1,000 mediations a year.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also has a regulatory body
that provides oversight to broker and trading activity. NYSE member
organizations hold 98 million customer accounts or 84 percent of
the total public customer accounts handled by broker- dealers. Total
assets of NYSE member organizations are over $ 4 trillion.
Account Security
Account security is not as great a problem as many people perceive
it to be. However, that doesn’ t mean that the opportunity for fraud
and account security breaches doesn’ t exist. Perhaps the greatest risk
occurs when traders go to their local coffee shop and log on to their
account through a wireless network. Entering your account password
in such a setting could put your password into the wrong hands. To
address this concern, see if your broker has a secure password key
for online access. This simple key generates a random number pass-
word, which changes every minute or so. Even if a hacker should get
your password in the coffee shop, it would be useless in seconds.
Another useful service offered by many brokers is an account
alert system. This will send alerts to your e- mail, cell phone, or per-
sonal digital assistant when any transactions or changes occur within
your account. Obviously, if an unauthorized individual should gain
access to your account, you would be notifi ed when they attempted
to do anything.

You Are in Control
In this fi ckle game of courting brokers, there’ s something that you
need to keep in mind: You ’ re the one in control. Brokers want your
business and when they get it, they don’ t want to lose you. Dating
prospective traders and investors is an expensive proposition for
brokers and they want to fi nd clients as cost and time effi ciently as
possible. Don’ t assume that the broker holds all the cards and that
you must meekly accept whatever service and pay whatever fees are
imposed upon you. Defi ne your requirements, do your shopping,
and you ’ ll fi nd that Mr. Right Broker is out there for you.

WEALTH HAS A PURPOSE
I
t was in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we were invited to present our
Five Points for Trading Success at the Traders Expo held in the Paris
Resort Hotel. With standing room only, the room was electrifi ed.
The venue had quickly fi lled to capacity and there was simply no
more room left for us to take any more traders who had come to see
us that day. We were disappointed that so many had to be turned
away but, at the same time, we couldn’ t help but be excited because,
it was then that we knew we had something special to offer. The pres-
entation went well and the crowd responded with many questions
and comments, letting us know that we struck a chord. As we were
wrapping up our equipment, a lady approached us and introduced
herself, thanked us for a great presentation, and asked us if we’ d
consider writing a book. We listened carefully to her proposal, but
as soon as she left the room, we looked at each other, laughed, and
said, “S ure, like we have time to write a book. ”
About six months later, we still had the book idea on our minds,
so we contacted our friend from Vegas. We chatted a bit about how
this project would come together, and after a number of conver-
sations, we agreed to commit our presentation to paper. We knew
that there would be challenges in being able to meet our chapter
deadlines, so we devised a plan to write as we traveled. There is no
denying that the seminar circuit can be as exciting as it is grueling,
and with a schedule as aggressive as ours, there were times when we
didn ’t even know where we were going until we looked at our travel

itineraries. So as we visited each country, we made it a point to write
along the way. Chapter 1 started in Atlanta, Chapter 2 in Orlando,
then on to Frankfurt, Switzerland, London, and Spain. Next stop,
Stuttgart, then Stockholm, followed by Chicago before returning
back home. As we wrote our fi nal chapters, we found ourselves in
Dubai, Hong Kong, and then Taiwan. We fi nally wound up in Paris
in a wonderful little coffee shop off the beaten path to write the last
pages of our manuscript. What started out as an almost impossible
feat for us wound up becoming one of the most rewarding experi-
ences of our lives. Not quite knowing how we were going to do it, we
did manage to complete these 15 chapters in less than three months.
With this being our last chapter, we thought it was important for us
to tell you some of the reasons why we do what we do and encourage
you to take action toward your goals and passions.
What Is Your Purpose?
We have done our best to deliver what we believe is a plan that can
help you create true wealth for yourself. Our goal was to take compli-
cated market strategies and break them down into simple ideas that
would be easy to understand and implement. While each chapter
has been fi lled with the “ how - to ” instructions for creating wealth by
using sound trading strategies and risk management principles, we
thought it was most important for us to explain some of the “ whys ”
for creating wealth.
We are individuals who believe that our lives have a purpose.
Many people think that the reason we do what we do is to show
investors how to make money and, although there is some truth to
that, our roots go much deeper. In the beginning chapters we talked
about greed as an emotion and how it was something that needed to
be controlled. As one of the driving forces behind price movement
in the market, there is no denying that greed can take on a life of its
own. We know that there are many thousands of people who believe
that if they were rich the world would think of them as being greedy
and with that belief comes guilt. As a result of this guilt, we have met
traders who have self - destructed, thinking that it’ s better for them
not to be rich. Instead, they settle for average wages and a life fi lled
with just getting by. Then there are some who believe they don’ t have
the capacity or deserve to be wealthy. These people do what they can
to avoid taking any action that might result in success.

There is something you need to know about The Market Guys.
Neither of us come from money, and we have both experienced
many challenges along the way that have taught us valuable lessons
about life. As children we learned from our parents that life is sweet
and the challenges we face make it even sweeter. However, the most
important thing we have both learned from our parents is that faith
is everything— faith in our ability to achieve; faith in people who
want to do what’ s right; faith in our Creator, who has given us the
opportunity to touch the lives of others who are less fortunate; and
faith in knowing that we all have a purpose in life. It’ s this faith that
brings us, two regular guys who have a passion for teaching and
a sweet tooth for life, to a place where we realize that it’ s not a series
of lucky breaks that has brought us to success but rather our purpose
in life that has brought us to you.
Take a good look around and you will see millions of regular
people working hard to make a living but have somehow forgot-
ten to make a life. It’ s sad to see so many people just wandering
through the years without even a simple plan for retirement. They
almost seem okay with just getting by, month to month, paycheck to
paycheck, with no regard for their future. Some are happy with the
status quo while others are striving to break out, waiting for the time
when they can make a difference. We’ re sure you’ ve heard variations
of the 80/20 rule, where 20 percent of the people are doers, who
make things happen, and 80 percent are the followers who let things
happen. If you think about it, the world needs both doers and fol-
lowers. The followers are the backbone of society, the driving force
behind most world economies, and if it weren ’t for them, the leaders
wouldn’ t have anyone to lead. The “ 20 - percenters” are movers and
shakers who are not afraid to take on some risk in their lives. These
are the people who were able to become good leaders because at
one time in their lives they were good followers.
But what really separates these two very distinct groups of people?
Actually, very little separates them. A 20 - percenter might be the fi ve-
year - old boy who runs a little bit harder on the football fi eld to score
the goal, or the middle- school girl who studies just a little bit longer
each day to make the grade. Twenty - percenters could also be the par-
ents who add an hour to their lunch in order to make the school play
during the day. These little extra efforts pay high dividends in the
world of the doers. And those extra hours for lunch, when invested
correctly, leave a lasting impression on the life of a child who sees

Mommy and Daddy clapping for them in the audience while they’ re
singing their song. If these examples are hitting home, then chances
are you are a doer who has sampled some of these dividends yourself.
It truly is the sweetness of life, and as we get older we see that the
examples we set become the standard others will follow.
As parents, we have seen the returns from investing in our kids.
They are mirrors who refl ect our beliefs and behavior patterns,
which is why parents should be careful about how they handle their
fi nances. If we’ re not careful, we could pass on a legacy of fi nancial
disaster to our children and grandchildren. What do you want your
legacy to be with your friends and family? What fi nancial legacy will
you leave to improve the world around you? These are the same
questions we ’ ve asked ourselves, and it’ s the reason why we have writ-
ten this book.
Changing the World One Person at a Time
Of course, we show people how to make money in the market, but
it ’s what we do with this money that makes all the difference. If you
think you are a doer now, just imagine what kind of a doer you will
be once you have accumulated signifi cant wealth in your life. If you
were that little boy on the football fi eld who ran a little harder to
help your team win the game then chances are you are the man who
will go the extra mile to help a homeless person. If you were that
middle -s chool girl who studied to make the grade then there is a
good possibility you are the teacher who stays back in class to help
that struggling student of yours. If you were one of those parents
who took off from work to see your child perform in the school play,
then you may be the one who winds up with grandchildren who are
leaders of the free world. We teach our children about greatness, but
it ’s our demonstration of faith that convinces them that they, too,
can go out and make the world a better place. If you have been to
any of our live seminars, you will always hear us talk about the rea-
sons why we do, and it ’s all about touching greatness.
We were in Stockholm when this idea hit us the hardest. Before
we enter any new country we make it a point to study the culture in
order to get a better understanding of the people there so we can
have an easier time relating to our audience. One of the things we
were glad to know is that most Swedes do not buy into the loud
infomercials that make promises of millions made overnight, nor do
they appreciate anyone making a scene in public, especially when it

comes to money. We have never been the ones who make false prom-
ises of instant riches. We were in Sweden to talk about how to create
wealth in the stock market, and we were doing it on a public stage
in the heart of Stockholm. We weren ’t sure how we were going to
be received. Right before we went on stage, back in the dressing
room, we made a decision to simply do what we have always done on
stage. We spoke for two days teaching charts, trends, risk manage-
ment, and options. At the end of the two- day seminar, we stood up
and told everyone in the theater why we do what we do. What hap-
pened next was nothing less than amazing.
One by one, people came to us. Annette spoke of the work she
was doing in the business community to help raise money for charity.
Maria, our emcee, introduced us to Nordine, a former professional
hockey player who retired from the sport to sells bricks. His story was
so fascinating that we had to learn more. Nordine was neither a brick-
layer nor a construction worker but, in fact, was one of those great
people who believe they are here to make a difference. Yes, he sold
bricks all right, but not in a way you might expect. He would search
for people who lived in small villages that were so poor they didn’ t
even have clean water to drink. Then, once he found these people,
he would go back home and sell bricks for them. Every brick he sold
carried with it the name of the person who purchased the brick. Once
he sold enough bricks, he would go back to those villages and build
wells for the people who needed water. Each well cost about $ 12,000,
but the most amazing thing about these wells is that it brought growth
to the local economies. Once a well was dug, people would travel to
it in order to get drinking water. Once there, they would spend what
little money they had on items found in shops scattered around the
well. As these small economies grew, roads were eventually built, allow-
ing more people to come. Some of the brick buyers would even come
to see the fruit of their generosity, and eventually there would be so
many people coming to these towns that it would attract the tourists.
Imagine for a moment what would happen if we bought one brick
from Nordine with every profi table trade. How many wells could we
build? Would that be important to the people in the village?
What ’s Your Story?
One at a time they came, one story after the other. Marie talked
about a nonprofi t organization called Students in Free Enterprise
(SIFE), telling stories of students who are aspiring to be the CEOs

of their own companies. With business plans in hand, they’ d partake
in competitions all over the world in order to showcase their talents
and ideas. The judges who vote in these competitions are CEOs of
major corporations who listen to the candidates present their busi-
ness plans and hear their dreams of changing the world for good.
Imagine how many young minds we could sponsor if we all took only
one week of our profi ts each year and put it toward an organization
like SIFE.
Then there was Charlie— a truly amazing man, 26 years young
with the wisdom of a 90 year old, who spoke about things he was
doing with students to encourage them as young entrepreneurs. For
years, these students have heard from the MBAs and lecturers who
had all of the degrees and accolades, but Charlie was special. When
Charlie spoke, people listened, because they knew he was the real
deal. His wisdom came through in every word, and you could see in
his eyes the passion for the work he was doing. You see, Charlie con-
sidered himself underprivileged as a child. With divorced parents
who were unemployed and a father who at one time was homeless,
Charlie refers to himself as “ The Ghetto Kid.” He and his cousin
are the only two in his immediate family to have graduated from
high school. Today, he speaks to college students to help guide them
through the initial stages of setting up a business. Keep in mind
that Swedish students are only obligated to go through nine years
of primary and secondary school, unlike U.S. students who are obli-
gated to 12 years before going to college. To look at him, you would
never know that he is a multimillionaire, yet that was the thing that
impressed us most about him. He is a humble man who knows where
he has come from but, interestingly enough, he now thinks of him-
self as being overprivileged. So he spends his days sharing his knowl-
edge and wealth with people he cares about, including his family,
and gives back to the world in thanksgiving.
It ’s overwhelming to see the outpouring of success stories. There
are so many stories that there are times when we are up on stage feel-
ing beside ourselves, it’ s that surreal. Through our travels around
the world, we are touching people and people are touching us. If
you are one of those people who have it in your heart to give back to
the world, then welcome to our club. The energy that keeps us going
comes from knowing that in our audience there will be one person
who will achieve a level of success that will earn him or her a place
in history. Is that person you? Are you the person who is going to go

out in the world with the wealth you have created for yourself and
make a difference?
If you understand what we have written in this book with regard
to profi ting in the markets, then you are now armed with a tool that
can change the world. It all starts with one person, one story, and
one trade. So, as you can see, the Market Guys represent a lot more
than showing people how to trade the markets. There is a much
bigger picture here. If you want to be a member of the most amaz-
ing network in the world, you must fi rst have faith that the plan will
work and be willing to act on that plan. Without the action plan,
everything just sits there. Everyone swims in a sea of ideas and oppor-
tunities but, without action, you never gain ground. One of the most
frustrating experiences of all is when you start wondering, “ what if.”
What if I had just acted on that idea years ago and followed through
on it? What if I had listened to myself and made that trade? What if
that trade allowed me to give back to those who have given to me?
Chatter Box — AJ
I would much rather regret something I have done than to regret
something I have not done.
Take Action
After you have followed the four points that we spoke about in the
previous chapters, you will see that it brings you to the last point,
which is to take action. This is the fi nal step in the “ how - to ” category,
and it’ s where we get to the place were we are entering the trade.
Many people get stuck on this part because it’ s the point in time
where they are actually taking the risk and not just thinking about
it. This is also the point where the fear emotion will appear. If this
is happening to you, then rest assured— you are in good company.
This is why we say, over and over again, expect to lose money from
time to time, but make sure you are protecting yourself when a stock
moves against you. If you are the person who is going to change the
world with your wealth, then you have a lot more riding on the line
than the person who is just looking to make a profi t in the market.

We are now holding you accountable for your losses. If you do not

gies, then this step- by - step plan of action will increase your prob-

enter the trade, and then protect with a stop loss. This is your plan
for taking action.

ask price The price at which a market maker is willing to sell a stock.
assignment A notice that is received by an option writer stating that the
option they have sold has been exercised by the purchaser or owner of
the option.
at-the-market Describes the action of one who enters an order to buy or sell
a stock immediately at the best available current price. A market order
guarantees execution but not a price, so be wary of using “market orders”
in stocks with low average volume or liquidity. If the bid/ask spread is
wide, you may wind up paying a lot more for that stock or o ption than
you originally anticipated.
at-the-money When an option has a strike price that equals the market
price of the underlying security. Example: If IBM were trading $95 per
share, the $95 call and put would be at-the-money.
bid and ask (also known as the National Best Bid and Offer, or NBBO) The
highest and lowest offers for a security in all exchanges and all market
makers.
bid price The price at which a market maker is willing to buy a stock.
breakout A price move over an established resistance level or below an
established support level that is generally supported by an increase in
volume.
call option Gives the owner the right, not the obligation, to buy stock at a
specific price over a given period of time.
cash-secured put selling The selling of a put option using cash in the
account to cover the purchase of the stock should the put seller be
assigned a long position. Selling a put obligates the seller to buy stock
from the buyer of the put option. The owner of the put option would
exercise the put, which requires the seller of the put to buy stock with
the cash that has been held aside in the account for this purpose.

cost averaging down A popular strategy based on a corrupt form of dollar
cost averaging. This is where traders buy more of a stock that is trend-
ing down in order to lower the cost basis of a losing position.
derivative In finance, a security whose price is dependent on or derived
from one or more underlying assets. The derivative itself is merely a
contract between two or more parties. Its value is determined by fluc-
tuations in the underlying asset. The most common underlying assets
include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and mar-
ket indexes. Most derivatives are characterized by high leverage.
dollar cost averaging This is where investors deposit small amounts of
money each month into an account that has been set up to automati-
cally purchase shares in a mutual fund equal to the amount deposited.
The goal is to accumulate shares in a retirement portfolio without hav-
ing to suffer the pain of having to endure extreme price swings brought
on by market volatility.
downtrend A time when successive drops in a security price close at levels
lower than those achieved in previous moves and when highs occur at
levels lower than previous highs.
exchange-traded fund (ET F) A basket of securities that is designed to
generally track an index—broad stock or bond market, stock industry
sector, or international stock—yet trades like a single stock.
expiration date The day in which the option contract expires. Technically,
most option contracts expire on the third Saturday of the expiration
month, but what most traders are focused on is the third Friday of the
expiration month, with that being the last day the option contracts can
be traded.
Expiration Friday The third Friday of the month, representing the last
trading day for the options in that calendar month. Example: Options
that carry the January expiration date will be traded up until the close
of the market on the third Friday of the month in January.
in-the-money For a call option, it’s when the option’s strike price is below
the market price of the underlying security. For a put option, it’s when the
option’s strike price is above the market price of the underlying stock.
In other words, it’s when an option has intrinsic value.
intrinsic value For call options, this is the difference between the under-
lying stock’s price and the strike price of the option. For put options,
it’s the difference between the strike price and the underlying stock’s
price. Keep in mind that if the difference is negative, the option has no

intrinsic value. Example: If IBM is trading at $95 and you are looking
at a call with a strike price of $90, the call will have intrinsic value equal
to $5. Compare that to a call with a strike price of $100; the $100 call
would have no intrinsic value.
Long-term equity anticipation securities (L E A P S) Publicly traded options
contracts with expiration dates that are longer than one year. Struc-
turally, LEAPS are no different than short-term options, but the later
expiration dates offer the opportunity for long-term investors or trad-
ers to gain exposure to prolonged price changes without needing to
use a combination of shorter-term option contracts. The premiums for
LEAPS are higher than for standard options in the same stock because
the increased expiration date gives the underlying asset more time to
make a substantial move and for the investor to make a healthy profit.
option chain A list of option quotes highlighting information such as
expiration month, strike prices, trading volume, and so on. The layout
is similar to what you might see in a typical spreadsheet.
out-of-the-money For a call, it’s when an option’s strike price is higher
than the market price of the underlying security. For a put, it’s when
the option strike price is below the market price of the underlying
security.
pending order file The place where limit buy and sell orders are held
until they are due for a fill. Market makers are very much aware of their
pending order file and many times will trade against the order flow
brought on by account holders of the broker they trade for.
premium This is the total cost of the option contract, which is nothing
more than the sum of the option’s intrinsic value and time value. It’s
important to know that volatility also affects the premium of an option.
Higher-volatility stocks have a tendency to trade with higher option pre-
miums because there is a great chance that these option contracts can
increase in value over a given period of time. This volatility premium is
reflected in the time premium and has no effect on intrinsic value.
profit taking The result of short-term traders placing sell orders in a stock
to realize a profit for the trader. This wave of selling results in the stock’s
moving to lower price levels.
put options Gives the owner the right, not the obligation, to sell stock at a
specific price over a given period of time.
resistance The price level at which the selling pressure is strong enough to
prevent the stock from rising further. You can think of this as a c eiling

where the sellers have convinced the buyers that they are outnumbered,
and the buyers move to the sidelines. Like support, this is not an exact
price level, and it’s best to think of resistance as a price area where sup-
ply in the stock has overcome the demand.
short covering The act of purchasing securities in order to close an open
short position. This is done by buying the same type and number of
securities that were sold short. Most often, traders cover their shorts
whenever they speculate that the securities will rise. In order to make
a profit, a short seller must cover the shorts by purchasing the security
below the original selling price.
short selling or “shorting” A way to profit from the decline in price of a
security, such as stock or a bond. To profit from the stock price going
down, a short seller can borrow a security and sell it, expecting that it
will decrease in value so that they can buy it back at a lower price and
keep the difference. Short sellers assume that they will be able to buy
the stock at a lower amount than the price at which they sold short. The
opposite of going long.
short squeeze A situation in which a lack of supply and an excess demand
for a traded stock forces the price upward. This, in turn, forces short
sellers into a position where they want out. As short sellers liquidate
and buy to cover their positions, the demand increases in the stock and
the price rally intensifies.
sideways trend A period of time when prices lay flat or move within a
relatively tight range. Also known as a trading range or consolidation
pattern, buyers and sellers establish boundaries that represent support
and resistance, yet supply and demand are balanced. Investors would
see this as a trend less stock.
simple moving average (SM A) The unweighted mean of the previous n
data points. For example, a 10-day simple moving average of closing
price is the mean of the previous 10 days’ closing prices.
stepping up A term used to describe the actions of a person who is moving
up his or her limit bid on a buy order. This is a common practice dem-
onstrated by the general public and one that market makers count on
after they have taken a long position in their own trading accounts.
strike price or exercise price The stated price per share, for which underly-
ing stock may be purchased (for a call) or sold (for a put) by the option
holder upon exercise of the option contract. When you exercise your

option, this is the value that you get the shares for. Option strike prices
are usually in increments of $2.50 or $5.00.
support Support is the level at which demand for the stock is strong
enough to keep the stock from dropping any further. Support levels
are usually identified somewhere below where the stock is actually trad-
ing and, although it is not an exact price point, we look at support as a
general area.
time value or time premium The portion of the option premium that is
attributable to the amount of time remaining until the expiration of
the option contract. Basically, time value is the value the option has in
addition to its intrinsic value.
trough A low point in a business cycle or on a statistical graph.
uptrend A time when successive rallies in a security price close at levels
higher than those achieved in previous rallies and when lows occur at
levels higher than previous lows.
underlying asset The stock, bond, currency, or other value that an option
contract is derived from. All references in this book were made to stocks,
which is the underlying asset for all options mentioned in Chapter 10.
volatility The amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of changes in
a security’s value. A higher volatility means that a security’s value can
potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means
that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time
period in either direction. Whereas a lower volatility would mean that a
security’s value does not fluctuate dramatically, but changes in value at
a steady pace over a period of time.
writer The seller of an option contract; one who sells or “writes” the option.
