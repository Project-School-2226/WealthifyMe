L
ET’S talk about your interest in the financial markets.
We’ll start with the hardest truth of all: it’s difficult to turn
profits and earn a living through the trading game. After
all, no one but the mint is printing money, nor does it grow
on trees.
So here’s the bottom line for anyone wanting to trade
stocks, currencies, or futures. You’ll either earn your suc-
cess through hard work or lose your stake and move on.
Trading has a mathematical advantage over investing,
and good traders will make more money over less time than
good investors. But the devil is in the details. It’s the
trader’s job to capture volatile price swings that flatten out
over the holding period of a buy-and-hold investor. As a
result, they need to master the challenging skill of time
management.
Take this pursuit seriously, and find a strategy that
capitalizes on market movement. Indeed, your success or
failure depends on the path you choose. The most danger-
ous road chases profits without an understanding of down-
side risk. The safest course builds skills one step at a time
and acts defensively when things go wrong.

xii FOREWORD
Fortunately, you’ve found your way to Thomas Carr’s
excellent book on trend trading. This informative text
opens the market vault to new and experienced traders,
welcoming them into our discipline with open arms.
Indeed, you’ll find everything you need to get started on
the road to trading profits in these enlightening pages.
But don’t stop your education there. Developing supe-
rior trading skills is a lifetime pursuit, in which we’re con-
stantly on the hunt for new ideas, methods, and strategies.
This active learning process keeps our game fresh in a
predatory market world that takes no prisoners.
Make sure your trading matches your lifestyle. You
can lose a lot of money when your reach exceeds your
grasp. Don’t trade every tick if you can’t follow the market
in real time. Don’t day-trade your investments or buy and
hold your trades. Never use the market as your therapy for
personal problems. It makes a terrible cellmate.
Watch the clock, and become a survivor. Develop a
sense of how stocks react to different cycles. Learn the
unique traits of the market day, week, and month. These
repetitive tendencies affect how prices move and how
traders trade. And they reveal telling quirks that produce
high-probability trades.
Catalog strange market behavior, and apply simple
techniques to trade it. Master a few setups, and let these
pay your way while you learn to play the game. Realize that
chasing hot stocks is a bad way to make money. Give up the
excitement and follow the precision of classic market
mechanics. They’ll produce consistent profits, with far less
stress.

FOREWORD xiii
Manage risk before worrying about profits. The most
important rule of risk management requires little inter-
pretation: Don’t enter a trade without knowing the exit.
Understand the risk of your positions, and get out when the
price action says you’re wrong. Trading small is the best
way for new players to control risk until they learn how to
make money. Remember that the markets will be there
tomorrow, next week, and next year.
Focus on precise entry and exit. Pick your price, and
stay on the sidelines when the market doesn’t give it to you.
Reduce position size when your buying or selling signals
don’t line up. Use discretion, execute wisely, and remem-
ber: good entries on bad stocks produce greater returns
over time than bad entries on good stocks.
The best trades come when the information flow sends
the same message in different ways. A moving average, news
report, and cross-market surge can all suddenly line up and
tell you to buy or sell. But avoid seeking out data and opin-
ions just to support your bias. The markets won’t care who’s
on your buddy list when they’re ready to move.
Finally, commit many hours of study and observation
to the market. Develop a predatory instinct, avoid greed,
and view this hobby as a lifelong obsession. Work hard to
complete your analysis, and don’t cut corners. Develop your
own trading style and don’t run with the herd.
Be patient, and the doors will eventually open to con-
sistent trading profits.

acknowledgments
A
COMPREHENSIVE book like Trend Trading for a Liv-
ing rests on the work of many others, past and present. As
a perpetual student of the markets and of trading systems,
I am privileged to have had many fine teachers and men-
tors whose contributions to this volume are evident on
every page. Let me take a moment here to acknowledge the
most important of those.
I owe a huge debt to the writings of the late Nicholas
Darvis, my first and greatest market inspiration, whose
story I tell in the Introduction. It was his box system that
first got me started in systems development, and it was his
breathless story of wealth creation in the stock market
while pursuing a full-time career that first inspired me to
believe that I could do it, too.
Even more, I am indebted to Alexander Elder, master
teacher and market psychologist, also mentioned in detail
in these pages. Dr. Elder first revealed to me the elegance
and logic of technical analysis as applied to price charts.
Many of the key concepts embedded in the systems
explained in this text come from his seminal work, Trading
for a Living, now considered a classic in trading literature.

I also wish to recognize a family friend, the late Gene
Browning. Gene was a successful options trader as well as
a man of deep faith; he is truly an exemplar of the life well
lived. Through several phone conversations, Gene taught
me that a career watching numbers and charts need not
necessarily exclude a life of devotion to higher principles.
Gene was first and foremost a disciple of Jesus Christ. He
always saw his trading skills as subservient to that calling.
This book would not exist were it not for Alan Far-
ley, whose commitment to teaching the art of trading to
others is second to none. Many years ago Alan embarked
on a career as a trader educator through his Web site,
Hardrightedge.com, and it was his example and encour-
agement (at a time when trading was mostly a profes-
sional’s game with rules unknown to the masses) that
inspired me to launch Befriendthetrend.com, now one of
the leading online sources of trading education. I am
deeplyindebtedtoAlanforvolunteeringtowritethefore-
word to this book, and I consider it a great honor.
Other important members in the cast of this drama
include Jamie Caputo, vice president at RBC/Carlin Equi-
ties, whose passion and enthusiasm for supporting traders
is as rare as it is contagious; Ken Adams, trading systems
developer, superb encourager, and long-term Silicon
Investor friend; and Dianne Wheeler, editor extraordinaire,
and all her colleagues at McGraw-Hill, for their tireless
confidence in this publication and their dedication to pub-
lishing professionalism.
A special thanks is owed to all our friends and part-
ners at Befriendthetrend.com: God bless you all!

INTRODUCTION
from passion to
profession
B
RAINSTORMwith me for a minute: what does the stock
market represent to you? What images come to mind?
What feelings do you associate with trading, with Wall
Street, with the global markets? When I reflect on what the
markets mean to me, this is what I come up with:
• A free-flowing stream of numbers, numbers,
numbers
• Greens and reds, ups and downs, peaks and
troughs, ebbs and flows
• A melting pot of products, services, technologies,
commodities, and information
• Manhattan high culture, soot-stained buildings,
suspenders and pinstripes
• A barometer of the economic and psychological
state of the nation, and of the world
• Power, greed, discipline, corruption, intelligence,
ecstasy, and agony
• The playground of very energetic people who
love making money

2 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• Icon of free-market capitalism, of democracy, of
America
• An efficient, highly accessible vehicle for creating
wealth, freedom, opportunity
Obviously, my impression of the stock market is an
amalgam of a variety of things. The market represents to
me the most challenging and most stimulating arena in all
of human culture. I love art, literature, architecture, sci-
ence, film, and fashion. I am a religiously committed per-
son and am conversant with many of the world’s major
philosophies. But of all products of human making, no
other so totally engages my intellect, my will, my passionas
does the stock market.
My introduction to the stock market came through a
recurring image in the pages of my favorite serial comic
book character: Richie Rich. There stood the “poor little
rich boy” in front of a glass-enclosed machine, slender tape
in hand, scrutinizing the ever-growing Rich fortune he was
destined to inherit. The neural network this image hard-
wired into my six-year-old brain must have been perma-
nent, for I have been striving ever since to understand what
Master Rich must have understood as he stared at that long
stream of paper. If I wanted to live like he lived (and what
young boy wouldn’t?), I knew I would one day have to
unlock the secrets of that mysterious ticker tape.
On my eighth birthday I asked for, and received, the
original, 1968 deluxe version ofthe Whitman Stock Market
Game. This classic game is played just like Monopoly, only
instead of buying famous streets, you accumulate shares in
some of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing companies.

                     PAGE 22                      
==================================================

FROM PASSION TO PROFESSION 3
At the time, those companies included Maytag, Woolworth,
American Motors, International Shoe, and General Mills
(how times have changed!). Players barter and bid for shares
and are forced to pay dividends when they land on a stock in
someone else’s portfolio. Unfortunately, I could not get any
of my playmates excited enough about the stock market to
play with me. So for the most part I played alone, often for
hours at a stretch, bidding against myselfas I amassed a small
fortune. Funny thing, I always won! As an aside, the 1968
Whitman Deluxe Stock Market Game is no longer manu-
factured, but you can occasionally find one for sale on eBay
for about $20.
My next childhood association with the stock market
came when I turned 12 and was old enough to walk on my
own to the downtown public library after school. The first
book I remember checking out with my new library card
was a biography of Howard Hughes. I devoured every
page, seeing in Hughes a real-life, grown-up version of
Richie Rich. While I remember not liking the man very
much, I recall wanting to do with my life what he was able
to do with his. I remember making the connection in my
mind between the ideas of risk, speculation, and passion-
ate investment on the one hand, and on the other, the kind
of freedom and power both Rich and Hughes enjoyed.
On my next visit to the library I walked up to the
librarian and asked, “Do you have any books on the stock
market?” Managing to hide a smile, the woman escorted
me quite courteously to a shelf located upstairs in a far,
dark corner. After looking over the neatly stacked books,
she pulled one down and handed it to me. “Here,” she said,
“you might like this one.” The book’s title couldn’t have

been more perfect: How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock
Market. It described how a young professional dancer
named Nicolas Darvas amassed a fortune by trading stocks
on only three bits of information: the high of the day, the
low of the day, and the close. Darvas invested in funda-
mentally sound, growing companies breaking out of con-
solidation bases on strong volume. Once he made a
purchase, Darvas would simply record the boxes the stock
price made as it moved above the base. A box was what
Darvas called the trading range the stock tended to trade
within, based on its daily highs and lows. If it broke above
the upper edge of the box, he would move the box up to a
higher level, but if it broke the lower edge of the box, he
would sell the stock and cut his losses.
Although I didn’t know it at the time, Darvas’s book
was my first introduction to systems trading—and I was
hooked. But I also knew that the kind of fundamental
analysis Darvas applied to the companies he traded was
beyond the competencies of my 12-year-old brain. So a
couple years passed before I picked up another stock mar-
ket book.When I did, I found a real winner, one that taught
me how a profitable system can turn the stock market into
a virtual money machine. It was Robert Lichello’s 1977
best-seller, How to Make $1,000,000 in the Stock Market
Automatically! Written in response to the 1970s bear mar-
ket, Lichello developed a system that exploited the type of
volatility that typically appears at market tops and bottoms.
Like Darvas’s box method, Lichello’s system was simple
and mechanical: after buying an initial position in a stock,
you buy more shares if the price goes down and you sell
shares if the price goes up. A mathematical formula was



==================================================
                     PAGE 24                      
==================================================

FROM PASSION TO PROFESSION 5
applied to the closing price at the end of each week to
determine what to do with your position: buy a little, sell a
little, or hold. In this way, Lichello claimed, a stock could
move up and down within a range—netting the buy-and-
holder very little—and still yield a handsome profit to the
one using his automatic investment management (AIM)
system.
After I finished Lichello’s book I decided to experi-
ment with his system to see whether it worked. I asked my
father to explain that odd section of the paper with tiny
print that listed all the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
companies and how they fared in that day’s trading. He
showed me how to read the numbers and suggested I focus
on a company I was familiar with. I chose McDonald’s. We
ate their hamburgers at least once a week, and though I
didn’t know that it was the fastest-growing franchise in the
United States, I was well aware from the big sign out front
that the number of hamburgers served at our local restau-
rant kept going higher. So I put the AIM method to work
with an imaginary 500 shares of McDonald’s.
Lichello’s AIM method requires only a weekly glance
at the closing price of a stock in order to work the system.
I decided that was too infrequent, so I checked the price
every day. I still remember feeling absolutely elated that
first day after my imaginary purchase upon learning that
MCD had closed (cid:1) 1/ point, netting me a paper profit of
4
$100. By the end of that first week, as I recall, MCD was
up a whole dollar. A $500 return in one week!
The problem with Lichello’s method is that it only
works with stocks making large up and down swings. How-
ever impressive a $1 move might be, it did nothing to trig-



==================================================
                     PAGE 25                      
==================================================

6 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
ger AIM’s signal to sell shares. That would have required
at least a $3 move. So I watched again the next week. Each
day I checked the paper to see how my shares did on the
big board battlefield, and each day my hopes would rise and
fall with each quarter-point advance or decline. This went
on for about two more weeks before I finally gave up out
of sheer boredom.
I decided to give Darvas’s box method another read. I
dog-eared the library’s copy of How I Made $2,000,000 in
the Stock Market, carefully taking notes on how to apply
every aspect of the system. Again, I took an imaginary
investment in my favorite company, McDonald’s. It cer-
tainly fit the Darvas profile: strong earnings growth, hot
prospects, and trading in a long-range base. So early in the
summer of 1974 I “bought” 500 shares of MCD in my
make-believe trading account and excitedly set about put-
ting Darvas’s system to the test. I drew up a kind of prim-
itive spreadsheet for keeping track of the daily highs and
lows in order to determine the boxes necessary to manage
the open position. At that time, MCD was trading in the
low 40s. It had recently broken out of a months-long trad-
ing range with a lower edge in the upper 20s and an upper
edge in the mid-30s. I already knew MCD was a funda-
mentally sound company, and this base breakout qualified
as a Darvas entry point. So I went long the stock around
$42 per share and set my stop-loss just under the lower
edge of the new trading range, around $37. About three
weeks later, the stock rallied to near $48 before closing the
month at $44, so I dutifully moved the Darvas box up two
points. My stop-loss now stood at $39, and I was comfort-
ably ahead nearly $1,000. Life was good!



==================================================
                     PAGE 26                      
==================================================

FROM PASSION TO PROFESSION 7
For a while things looked promising. The position
came close to getting stopped out following a stern earn-
ings warning, but my box was not touched and I remained
in the trade. Then disaster struck. MCD declared earnings
that fell below even their lowered prediction, and this was
followed promptly by several high-level downgrades. In a
swift New York minute I was taken out of the trade for an
imaginary, but no less painful, loss of $1,500. Suddenly, and
decidedly, my career as a teenage Wall Street tycoon had
come to an end.
I grew up a bit after that. I got interested in sports,
girls, parties—the usual adolescent distractions. At 18 I
went off to university to study medicine, until I discovered
I hated being in hospitals and felt nauseated at the sight of
blood. So I switched to religious studies and philosophy,
and 10 years of graduate study later found myself with a
doctorate in the subject, teaching the rudiments of Plato
and Aquinas to undergraduates.
Having weathered a very frugal decade as a starving
graduate student, and with a mountain of student loans and
credit card debt to pay off, not even a full-time professor’s
salary could tempt me back into the trading game. But
when I took up an offer to teach summer school, the $5,000
bonus brought with it, rather unexpectedly, a return of the
old trading bug.
The year was 1996 and a new trading tool was all the
rage: 24-hour financial television. First came the CNN-
Financial Network, and then CNBC and Bloomberg Tele-
vision. When this input coupled with Internet trading chat
rooms, online discount brokers, and cheap charting Web
sites, Wall Street quickly became Main Street. The market

8 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
had just put in a huge year in what was then the middle of
the great bull market of the 1990s. Cab drivers shared stock
tips, bus boys traded between shifts—the age of the day
trader had dawned. The smell of quick profits was in the
air, and I wanted to inhale as deeply as possible. So I opened
an online brokerage account that summer and put the
entire $5,000 into it. In those days, there were no pattern
day trader rules, so with $5,000 you could buy up to
$10,000 worth of stock on margin and trade it repeatedly
throughout the day.
I decided that with such a small amount of capital to
work with I had better stick with lower-priced stocks. So I
scanned the chat rooms and investor threads for ideas. I
soon found one. On all the major sites, traders were
buzzing with talk about a small public company that was
developing a process by which to turn sewage into safe
drinking water. There were rumors that the CEO was
going to be interviewed on a network news show sometime
that week, and that he would drink a full glass of former
sewage in front of the cameras to prove his confidence in
his company’s system. Speculation ran wild that this expo-
sure to millions of viewers would drive institutional
investors to buy up shares in droves.
This seemed about as close to a sure thing as I could
find. So I decided to make my first real-money stock pur-
chase in this wastewater treatment company. This small-cap
Nasdaq issue was trading around $2.00 at the time, so I
bought a starter position of 1,000 shares. I anxiously
watched the news that night, but there was no mention of
the company. The rumors persisted, and on the next day the
stock opened around $2.50. In my euphoria, I bought 1,000

more shares. When just before the close the stock hit a high
of $3.00, I bought 1,000 more shares, bringing my position
to 3,000 shares at a total investment of $7,500, one-third of
which was borrowed from my broker on margin.
That night my heart raced as the news promo men-
tioned a feature story on a “miracle” water purification sys-
tem that could revolutionize the way water is used and
supplied around the world. This purification process was
heralded as having the potential to save the lives of millions
of children around the world who would otherwise have no
access to clean drinking water. At that moment I clicked
onto the discussion thread monitoring the stock and shared
in the preannouncement revelry along with dozens of other
investors who, like me, had bought thousands of shares in
anticipation of this moment. I had never imagined trading
stocks could be this easy, or this fun. We were all going to
“clean up” on this one, pun intended!
I waited restlessly through the other stories of the eve-
ning until Tom Brokaw finally announced the feature we
were all waiting for. The preview clip even showed the
CEO of an “innovative water treatment company” being
challenged by Brokaw to drink a glass of what was formerly
sewage, purified by his system. The CEO announced,
“Sure, I’ll drink that!” With those words, I began a men-
tal process that I have repeated numerous times since: I
began calculating what I would do with my sudden wind-
fall. My conservative estimate was that the stock would
(cid:1)
double overnight, giving me a paper return of at least 125
percent. I planned to sell half my shares and hold the rest
as a free trade as the stock ramped up into double digits.
With a fresh account of $7,500 in cash, I would then begin

stalking my next conquest and do the same thing over
again—and again and again—until, like so many of the
other day traders I had been hearing about, I would retire
young to a seaside mansion and spend my days lounging
poolside.
The commercials ended, and Brokaw stood again on
screen, ready to introduce the final story of the night. He
began by outlining the global problem of polluted water,
which accounts for a massive number of deaths in devel-
oping nations. With that segue, he ushered in the concept
of using ultraviolet radiation along with microfilters to
sanitize wastewater. At that moment, there flashed over
Brokaw’s right shoulder a company logo and name, a com-
pany that held the patent on and exclusive marketing rights
to a machine that is capable of transforming raw sewage
into something that even Evian could bottle. There,
plainly visible to millions of television viewers—including
hundreds of hedge fund managers, mutual fund analysts,
brokers, and day traders—was the logo and name, not of
the company whose shares I owned, but of its primary
competitor!
Once the initial shock wore off, I immediately plunged
into denial. Surely there must have been some mistake.
NBC miscued the name of the company, and tomorrow a
public relations campaign would swing into action to cor-
rect the misinformation. Or perhaps, I quickly reasoned,
this is, in fact, very good for our company. People will now
invest in the whole sector, and our little company will get
swept up in what would become the great water purifica-
tion bubble of 1996!
As I tuned back in to Brokaw’s interview, I watched

intently as the CEO drank a full glass of water taken from
his machine. We were told that the water had been
reclaimed runoff from the city’s drainage system. No doubt
this display of confidence in the capacity of the process to
produce potable product would go far with industry ana-
lysts. I imagined thousands of calls being placed the next
day to brokers asking about any and all companies working
in this niche market. Again, my euphoria returned.
All was well and good—until Brokaw asked one final
question: “So just when will your machine be available to
the market?” It was a reasonable question, the kind of ques-
tion one would expect a top-notch journalist like Brokaw
to ask. And to this day every bit of the CEO’s answer—the
tonality, the meter, the syllabification—remains embedded
in my brain. “Oh, the process is too expensive right now to
make it marketable.” “So . . .” Brokaw pressed, “just how
long will it take to get the costs down?” “Well, we are 15,
maybe 20 years out,” replied the CEO.
And that was it. There was nothing to be done about
it. In those days there was no postmarket trading available
to make a quick exit. All I could do was wait it out. I knew
that throughout the night, traders would start piling up the
sell orders, and in the morning at the market’s open the
price of the stock would plummet—and along with it, all
my hopes for early retirement! Sure enough, the stock
opened the next day at $1.75 per share, well below my aver-
age cost basis for the position. There were far too many
orders ahead of mine to get so many shares out easily, and
by the time my order filled, I received $1.38 per share, for
a loss of over $3,500 if you include the commissions. My
trading account was devastated. In a fit of shame and self-

disgust, I wired the money out of the account and closed it
the next day.
Well, even after that embarrassing experience I sim-
ply could not shake the trading bug. The next summer I
taught summer school again, and again I opened a small
trading account with my extra $5,000. This time, I decided
I would do things the right way. I would transform myself
into a long-term buy-and-holder, a value investor, a cham-
pion of sound fundamentals and fiscal responsibility. I read
just enough Lynch, Buffett, Zweig, and O’Neil to know
that what I was looking for was a company with that magic
combination of regularly increasing earnings, increasing
pricing power, lots of cash on hand with little debt, a hot
new set of products, and solid growth prospects. I believed
the road to market riches lay in finding the next Microsoft,
Wal-Mart, or Starbucks before the rest of the investing
world. You buy before the growth phase hype hits the
streets and then hang on until, after a dozen splits, you sell
your nest egg for a small fortune.
Bolstered by this hope, I went searching for the next
big thing. What I found was a series of stocks destined,
through no fault of their own, to separate me from my
hard-earned money. There is no way I could have known
it at the time, but that summer of 1997 was not the most
opportune time to initiate new long positions. Despite a
raging bull market in tech and Internet stocks, the broader
markets were overdue for a consolidation, and they sure got
one: the S&P chopped sideways for four months and then
midyear began a decline that took it 13 percent below its
high. It was in that environment that I had determined I
would begin my career as a successful long-term investor.

So after several days of research, I bought a small
company that provided diagnostic equipment to the airline
industry. The stock’s press releases referred to the com-
pany as holding exclusive contracts with several large car-
riers. New management on board had been weaned away
from successful careers elsewhere. There was little debt
and plenty of cash on hand to begin buying up the compe-
tition. This company had the smell of Buffettology all over
it. It had the right products, under the right management,
and with the right business plan to take me and my nest egg
to the zenith of financial security; unfortunately, it was in
the wrong sector. As profits for the airlines began to dry
up, my little company and its exclusive contracts were
quickly shown the door. The stock went from $5 per share
to under a buck and was then delisted from the Nasdaq,
before the company eventually went bankrupt.
Next I bought a boutique electronics dealer with an
absurdly low price/earnings (P/E) ratio, no debt, and lots
of great press. It had weathered the market pullback well
and had recently hired a new CEO. Moreover, the com-
pany had just finished a series of small acquisitions, which
would ensure their stronghold in the industry. But, as luck
would have it, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and Circuit City were
just beginning to expand their operations, and my little
firm just couldn’t compete. Again, I lost money.
I decided to give the buy-and-hold strategy one more
try. With what little cash I had left (about $1,000), I bought
into a company that, after DELL and CSCO, was supposed
to be the must-own stock of 1997. The stock was in a com-
pany that went by the unusually Latinate name of Qual-
comm.

In late October, the broader stock indexes had rallied
off their lows and looked to be breaking out to new highs.
So with what was left of my trading stake, I bet it all on
QCOM. Within three weeks, it dropped 40 percent. But
this was a long-term hold, so I dutifully held on to my
shares. I held the stock for six more months. It went up; it
went down. It went up and down again. And again. Finally,
at just slightly worse than a break-even price, I sold my
shares just to get rid of the nausea. Imagine how heartbro-
ken I felt when less than a year later the stock ramped up
by 2,500 percent! Had I held on to those few shares worth
around a thousand bucks, I would have had the opportu-
nity to cash out within the year with a quarter-million-
dollar nest egg. Arrggh!
It was at this point that I decided to formulate three
rules that I have held to ever since:
1. Don’t trade on chat room tips.
2. Don’t trade on news reports.
3. Don’t trade on economic or business forecasts.
I decided that I needed, in all humility, to admit the
shortcomings in my preparation as a trader. Although I
possess an embarrassing amount of formal education, I am
trained in neither economics nor business management. I
remember the supply-and-demand curve from my bone-
head economics class in college, but the finer intricacies of
micro- and macro-economic relationships escape me.
Thus, I decided to leave fundamental analysis to the pro-



==================================================

fessionals. As for hot stock tips or trading news flashes,
there is already a healthy crowd moving in on that action
and I’ve never had much of a liking for crowds.
No, if I was going to succeed in the trading game—
and by now this was a matter of resolute determination—
I would have to come up with a trading methodology that
was well suited to my experiences, my temperament, and
the constraints on my time and energy as a full-time pro-
fessor. Following several weeks of research, I decided that
what I needed to learn more about was technical analysis, a
methodology that relies on simple mathematical relation-
ships along with intuitive price pattern recognition.
Think about this for a moment: fundamental analysis
relies on an almost infinite array of inputs, from balance
sheets and earnings projections to changes in management,
sector cycles, product development, and a whole host of
other things too numerous to mention. How can any sin-
gle human mind, however well trained in business theory,
keep track of it all? And not only do you have to know
everything about the company you want to invest in, you
also have to know everything about its competitors, its sec-
tor, its industry . . . and then you have to weigh this knowl-
edge against a background of national, and indeed global,
economic analysis. Frankly, who has the time for all that?
Now consider this idea: what if everything you needed
to know about a company’s future prospects were already
there in the price of its shares? This is the key assumption
of technical analysis. If the price of your shares is going up,
the market likes your company’s prospects. If the share
price is going down, it doesn’t. It’s as simple as that. Tech-

nical analysis saves a ton of time, is accessible to anyone
regardless of education, and, if rightly applied, works pretty
darn well.
So I decided then and there that I would focus exclu-
sively on technical analysis to trigger my buy and sell sig-
nals. The combination of disciplines inherent to technical
analysis seemed to mesh well with my academic training:
as a scholar of ancient texts, I had experience both in the
objective discernment of linguistic relationships and in the
more subjective art of interpretation. Technical analysis
seemed to me to be the closest thing to putting these two
skills to work on the markets.
Instead of income statements and balance sheets, tech-
nical analysts work with price charts. Price charts graphi-
cally portray the historical movements of a stock’s price and
trading volume. They are fixed pictures of a stock’s past
price behavior over time. The analyst who works with
charts is thus part historian, part psychologist, part philos-
opher: with an experienced eye, she reads the chart to
understand its past price patterns, which then allows her to
generate a psychological profile of the stock’s current state,
as well as project a conceptual framework within which the
stock is most likely to move going forward. In other words,
technical analysts are to the financial world what liberal arts
professors are to the world of academia: highly experienced
in the arts of evaluation, interpretation, and application.
So with my newfound commitment to learning the
finer points of technical analysis, I went in search of men-
tors. The first thing I did was enroll in a seminar taught by
a fellow whose name I won’t mention here, since he was later
convicted of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Com-



==================================================

mission (SEC). Nevertheless, while this trader’s marketing
tactics were suspect, he did, in fact, teach a valid, if basic,
technical methodology, the skeleton of which forms the
basis of several of the systems outlined in this book. In the
seminar I was taught how to use moving averages to deter-
mine trend direction and strength, and the stochastics indi-
cator to time entries and exits. To this day, I use both to
advantage and consider this particular setup the most reli-
able of all possible setups. To this fellow I truly owe the
foundation of my entire “befriend the trend” system.
An Amazon.com search led me to a second mentor,
Alexander Elder. His 1993 best-seller, Trading for a Living,
now deemed a classic in the field, is a highly readable intro-
duction to both the mathematics and the meaning of the
various tools used by technical analysts. Elder is himself a
professional psychologist, so I immediately felt at home
with someone who, like me, came to the world of trading
without a Wall Street or B-school background.
From Elder I learned most of what I now know about
the most common technical indicators. I learned what tech-
nical oscillators and price patterns tell us about the psy-
chological state of equity markets. I learned about trend-
lines and how to use them to apply patterns of containment
to future movements in price. Most important, perhaps, I
learned to recognize and evaluate divergences between
price and oscillator behavior. These disjunctions between
price trends and the visually portrayed mathematics of
those trends provide important psychological clues to the
current health and likely forward projection of trends.
Other seminars were to follow. I spent time with
Welles Wilder, learning how to combine various indicators

with projection trendlines. I learned the finer points of
Japanese candlesticks from Steve Nison. In addition to
reading all the best-selling books about day trading, I read
widely about the stock market itself, the history of Wall
Street, and the biographies of several of its biggest players.
With these resources under my belt I began to put together
and experiment with various technical systems that could
be used to recognize profitable market probabilities. It is
this set of systems that I am referring to in this book when
I talk about trend trading. I use the technical systems I have
personally developed to determine the nature and strength
of a stock’s trend, and then use those systems again to alert
me to short-term buying and selling opportunities.
There are four different sources of input used in these
systems (in no particular order):
• Price patterns (as determined by the use of
trendlines and channel lines)
• Moving averages
• Technical oscillators (the exact mix I use changes
with the markets, but the core five are MACD,
stochastics, RSI, CCI, and OBV)
• Japanese candlesticks
Essentially, successful technical reads of stock charts
are all about two things: present price and past price. Price
patterns supply the historical context portrayed by past
price that in turn gives meaning to present price. Moving
averages give us a visual smoothing of the changing tem-
poral relationship between the two. The various technical
oscillators render a visual account of the mathematical rela-

tionships between the two. Japanese candlesticks graphi-
cally mark the relationship between the current closing
price and the range within which the stock traded on an
intraday basis.
Definition: A price trend refers to the general
direction a stock price displays on a price chart
when it is moving either up (bullish trend) or
down (bearish trend). When a stock is not in a
trend but is merely moving up and down within
a trading range, we call that a trendless or range-
bound market.
Together, these four vectors map out the relationship
between a stock’s past and its present state much in the
same way the tools of the philosopher (logic, theories of
knowledge, metaphysics, etc.) allow him or her to apply
ancient wisdom to the issues of the day.
So I set to work hammering out my systems in real-
time trading. In order to do this right, I knew I needed the
support of an experienced community. To that end, I joined
an online trading forum called Silicon Investor. In July of
1998, I started a discussion thread there named “Befriend
the Trend Trading,” and it soon became one of the most
popular threads on the site. In dozens of daily posts, I
thought out loud about how to best combine these elements
into a series of workable, profitable systems. I posted my
picks for the day and followed up with a record of profits
and losses. Soon other, more experienced traders joined
me, offering their advice and contributing to the overall
methodology. We became a tight, mutually supportive net-

work. And within a year, we were consistently, even at times
radically, profitable.
Though no one knew it at the time, 1999 will always
be remembered—by traders at least—as the year of the
infamous tech bubble. The Nasdaq market was ramping up
in parabolic fashion. Waiters and barbers were retiring on
their investments in Qualcomm, Cisco, Yahoo, and Ama-
zon. Everyone was trading stocks, talking stocks, hyping
stocks. Traders were trendy, sexy, and (so everyone thought)
rich. They were treated by the media like rock stars, mak-
ing appearances on Good Morning America and The Tonight
Show. Bankers, doctors, dentists, and lawyers were leaving
their six-figure salaries to stay at home, sit in front of com-
puters in their bathrobes, and day-trade. A year and a half
later, the markets would crash and day tradingwould become
a dirty word. Until that time, however, the party was on and
there was no shortage of revelers.
A few made an amazing amount of money in those
heady days. One well-known example was Dan Zwanger.
In 1999 he turned $11,000 rescued from his greedy but
incompetent broker into a $14 million fortune. Another
fellow who goes by the name of “Waxie” sold his trading
card collection for $150,000, and after his broker reduced
it to $30,000, he took control of his portfolio and turned
it into $7 million.
We did okay, too. The Silicon Investor thread narrates
my experimental venture into the world of high-turnover
trading. Because my capacity to stomach market fluctua-
tions is not that strong, I mostly stuck with well-known,
larger-cap issues as I continued to refine my systems. We
did not yield as much return as the Nasdaq did that year



==================================================

( 86 percent), but we managed to turn in our first full year
of profitable trading.
Then came the year 2000, a year of reckoning. Once
all the Y2K fuss had died down, several words that hadn’t
been heard much the previous year began to be tossed
about on the financial shows: words like valuation, sustain-
ability, and that dreaded “b” word, bubble. The intraday
volatility increased fivefold as prescient profit takers clashed
with bullish latecomers. The get-rich-quick gold rush was
over, but it took about six months before most traders and
investors realized it. During that time there were regular
intraday swings on a scale of wildness that would have made
even the late Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, recoil in
fear.
It was in that environment that I began to experi-
ment with a trading system I called BTTT-MAX. BTTT
stood for Befriend the Trend Trading (our company
name), and the MAX part of the acronym stood for Mov-
ing Average Crossover. In this system you were fully
invested 100 percent of the time in one or more of the
most volatile stocks trading. You watched the intraday
hourly chart, and on bullish crossovers, you went long; as
soon as a bearish crossover was spotted, you sold the
shares and immediately went short. Since in that envi-
ronment signals came every few hours, and given the vio-
lent nature of the intraday swings during that period,
BTTT-MAX quickly piled up huge returns.
I’ll never forget my first real-money experiment with
BTTT-MAX. I was on spring break from the college and
spent the week glued to my computer, trading stocks. In
my first experiment with MAX, I traded NOVL, then

priced in the 30s but headed to single digits before the year
was out. I started with 100 shares per side, taking every sig-
nal on an hourly basis. After three days of trading I was up
nearly $800. Easy money! Encouraged, I added size and
began to trade a basket of four stocks per the system. Two
days later I was up another $2,200. While my colleagues
were out fertilizing their lawns, I had banked a cool three
grand simply by clicking my mouse every couple of hours.
Nor did the fun stop there. Three months of extreme mar-
ket volatility managed to exploit the MAX system to such
a degree that by the end my account had increased over 500
percent!
Word soon got out about the simple system with the
catchy moniker put together by a religious studies profes-
sor who was turning a messy market into a pot of gold. The
Silicon Investor thread shot to the top of the hot list and
stayed there for weeks, and I soon found my phone ring-
ing with requests for interviews. The Wall Street Journal
wanted to know whether I thought the markets would
come back and take out the March 2000 highs. I don’t
remember now what I said, but I’m sure it was something
like this: “It really doesn’t matter. What matters is having
a great system (like BTT-MAX), which can make money
in any kind of market!”
Then U.S. News and World Report did a feature story
on part-time day traders, using me as their poster child.
The story included a full-page color spread of “Dr Stoxx”
sitting in his cramped college office. Unbeknownst to me,
the story intended to focus on losing traders, and since I
was coming off a hard week my only quote after a three-
hour interview was about losing $1,500 on a JNPR trade.

After that, I wised up to the fact that the media wished to
portray traders negatively (as greedy, irresponsible, socio-
pathic dropouts), and so I declined all further interviews.
As seasoned traders know well, a system like BTTT-
MAX, which exploits particular market conditions, works
well only until those conditions change. Sure enough, they
did, and our profits began to dry up. I have since refined
the system to keep us out of the markets when conditions
are not right, but I doubt we will ever see returns with the
system like we saw in that magical summer of 2000.
In the years since the market’s bubble burst, since
those ecstatic days of BTTT-MAX, I’ve been hard at work
expanding the universe of Befriend the Trend Trading sys-
tems. In 2002 we launched our Web site, Befriend-
thetrend.com,along with a free weekly newsletter designed
to highlight one new stock pick each week derived from
whatever system was working best at the time. Today, five
years on, we are still going strong, with over 7,000 sub-
scribers to that original newsletter. Over the years we have
launched three additional newsletters for paying sub-
scribers and have seen brisk sales on the six trading manu-
als we have published and two seminars we’ve held. Our
latest venture began in March of 2005, when I incorporated
a capital management company and partnered with RBC
Carlin Equities and Goldman Sachs to oversee the
Befriend the Trend Fund for accredited investors. Yes, I
still teach (and enjoy teaching) undergraduate students at
the college the finer points of philosophy and religion.
Nothing has been easy since the nearly vertical market
ramp-up of the late 1990s. The broader indexes have been
trading within tighter and tighter ranges, as the SEC and

Federal Reserve are quicker to clamp down on excesses.
Currently, as I write this, various markers for market volatil-
ity (the VIX, Bollinger Band Width, option premiums, etc.)
are just beginning to rise off historic lows. Global and local
economies have had to discount things like terrorism, ris-
ing oil prices, and natural disasters. The current buzzword
among market prognosticators is not valuationor bubblebut
geopolitics. Day traders are out, and hedge fund managers—
a far more powerful influence on market volatility—are in.
Recently, both Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs fired
dozens oftraders because they were not making any money.
The markets are just that tough!
The good news is that in any market condition, with
the right systems at hand, trading can nicely supplement
your income, and if you have the patience to stick with it
for a while, it can even make you very wealthy. It takes
some work getting up to speed on the terminology. Learn-
ing to read a chart is a little bit like learning a foreign lan-
guage. But the hard part has been done for you. You hold
in your hands the culmination of years of intensive labor,
done on your behalf. Here you have all the information you
need to find stocks poised to move, to take positions in
those stocks, and to exit those positions with the greatest
exposure to profit and the least exposure to risk. The trad-
ing systems outlined here have been designed to be as close
to 100 percent mechanical as possible. And each system is
complete. You are not taught here a few fundamental prin-
ciples and then left on your own to apply them to the mar-
kets. I’ve done all the necessary applicational steps for you.
All you have to do is copy my work.

less of your education, your trading experience, your flu-
ency with numbers, you, too, can trade for a living. Can
you tell whether a line is moving up or down? Can you
click a mouse? Then you, too, can trade for a living. We at
Befriendthetrend.com wish you all the best as you start this
wonderful adventure of trend trading.

what you need to
get started
T
REND trading is the ideal home-based business. There
is no inventory to store in warehouses, nothing to ship, no
bothersome customers, no cold calling, no gimmicky mar-
keting. You don’t have to haunt garage sales and flea markets
looking for items to sell on eBay. Unlike real estate invest-
ing, traders don’t have to worry about doing any maintenance
work or tracking down renters who are late with their pay-
ments. There is no Wal-Mart down the road to undercut
your prices. There are no franchise fees, no staff to employ,
no lawyers to keep on retainer.
Yes, there is a certain amount of starting capital
required, and yes, there are some monthly costs that will
make a small dent in your profits. Compared to most other
home businesses, however, trend trading has as low a set of
barriers to entry as any business could possibly have. Profit
margins run well over 90 percent. It’s hard to beat that!
All you really need to trade profitably and comfort-
ably are a good chair, a newer computer with a wide-screen
monitor, a high-speed Internet connection, some software,
a calculator, and paper and pen. That’s it. I’m guessing that
many of you reading this will already have most if not all

of these items, but if you do not yet have them, let me offer
some guidance on the more important ones.
HARDWARE
I recommend using a recent-model desktop PC or Macin-
tosh computer. Between these two formats, the Windows-
based option is the better choice, since most of the software
useful for trading is available only in that format. With the
recent success of newer and faster Mac computers, this may
change in coming years, but for now the widest selection
of trading software can be found only for the Windows
platform.
Regarding the computer, processor speed is not as
important as memory capacity. To be sure, the faster the
processor speed, the better. The fact is, though, that even
the cheapest new PC today is plenty fast enough to handle
what you will need for trading. Memory, however, should
not be skimped on. With a large amount of random-access
memory (RAM), you will be able to run your trading plat-
form, charting software, news feed, and a couple of Web
browsers all at once without running the risk of freezing
your machine due to overload. RAM capacity of 500MB is
sufficient to run most trading platforms and charting pack-
ages simultaneously, but a doubling of that would nearly
guarantee a flawless trading experience.
The monitor is also an important piece of your trad-
ing arsenal. As a rule, the larger the monitor, the better.
For this reason, laptops are not the best choice for trading.
They are fine for those days you are on the road and need
to keep tabs on your portfolio. I find myself frequently



==================================================
                     PAGE 50                      
==================================================

WHAT YOU NEED TO GET STARTED 31
trading from the local Starbucks on a laptop with wireless
broadband connection. But try opening your trading work-
station, your real-time charts, a quote streamer, your watch
lists, and your Befriend the Trend newsletters all at once,
and you will soon realize how necessary it is to have as
much desktop space as possible. Some traders use more
than one monitor to trade from, and if you can afford it
this is not a bad idea. You may need to install a dual video
card to handle more than one screen, but the small invest-
ment will be worth it.
There are also multiscreen and tiling screen monitors
now that are designed especially for traders. These can give
you up to 100 diagonal inches of desktop space: a genuine
luxury. They are expensive, however, running over $5,000
each for the better models. As for me, I use a single, 24-inch
flat-panel, high-definition monitor and do not consider this
at all hazardous to my trading. But try to trade every day
on a tiny 14-inch screen? No way!
If you are interested in multiple monitors and can
afford it, take a look at a company called Digital Tigers
(assuming they are still in business). They produce multi-
panel monitors with as many as seven separate panels,
including a television display. Imagine having CNBC on
one panel and Bloomberg on another panel, with additional
panels devoted to your trading platform, a variety of your
favorite charts, and browsers open to trading chat rooms,
discussion threads, and your Befriend the Trend Newslet-
ters. Now that is trading heaven! They also manufacture a
product called a sidebar, which allows you to plug a multi-
ple monitor into your laptop (though then it is no longer a
laptop, is it?).

32 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
SOFTWARE
Where you go with software will depend greatly on what
kind of capital you are starting with in your trading
account. If you are trading under $10,000, then you will
need to find ways to get your streaming data and charts for
as little cost as possible (remember, I started out with only
$5,000). If, however, you can fund your account with up to
$25,000, then you can afford to step up to the next level,
and I’ll show you how. If you are fortunate enough to plunk
over $50,000 of risk capital into your account, then let me
show you the sort of premium services that will serve your
trading well.
The truth is, you really do not need to spend any
money at all on software to have all the tools you need to
trade safely and profitably. There are free services galore
in the trading world. And among the fee-based providers,
many will let you download their basic services without
paying. Of course, they hope you will like their entry for-
mat so much that you will be willing to pay for the
upgrade. But in most cases you will have all the informa-
tion you need to trade the markets profitably without much
in the way of overhead costs.
Among the free services, your first stop should be
Stockcharts.com. Stockcharts.com offers a fantastic Web-
based technical charting service that you can use for free.
Simply by signing up you will have access to 20-minute
delayed charts with a wide variety of technical indicators,
limited stock scans you can use to find setups, sector and
market breadth analysis, and much more. Their candle-
glance feature allows you to create and save an infinite



==================================================
                     PAGE 52                      
==================================================

WHAT YOU NEED TO GET STARTED 33
number of small charts that you can use as your primary
watch lists (explained later). With low-cost upgrades,
Stockcharts.com will allow you to access real-time charts
and scan for an unlimited number of setups.
Real-time quotes should be available from your bro-
ker, but if, like me, you like a freestanding quote streamer,
you should download a copy of Jerry Medved’s award-
winning Quotetracker software. It is free and compatible
with dozens of data sources, including most online broker-
ages and real-time charting packages. Quotetracker
includes Level II quotes, real-time intraday charts, price
alerts, and a news feed—all for free! The software is ad-
supported, so you will have to put up with periodic ban-
ners and pop-up ads, but for a very small monthly fee
(about the price of one trade commission) you can use a
version without the ads. For further information and to
download the software, just go to Quotetracker.com.
If you wish to take your trading to the next level and
want that extra measure of control over your entries and
exits, then you will need a real-time charting package.
While Quotetracker offers real-time charts for free,
many do not find the charting format very user friendly.
The same can be said for the charts offered by most
online brokers. Instead, I would recommend moving up
to IQCharts. As a midpriced service, IQCharts offers a
real-time, stand-alone charting package that includes all
the indicators you will need, intraday charts that auto-
matically update in real time, the ability to store dozens
of watch lists with slide-show capabilities, and both pre-
packaged and construct-your-own scans with technical
and fundamental parameters. IQCharts is also one of the



==================================================

==================================================

34 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
only real-time charting packages currently available for
the Macintosh platform.
Another midpriced option is TC2000. In addition to
a real-time charting system, TC2000 offers stock advisory
guidance from the company’s founders, the Worden broth-
ers. They also have a community feature where stock trad-
ers can chat with each other in real time about what they
are trading, and the Worden brothers themselves offer free
daily market commentary to all paying subscribers.
The highest level of trading sophistication comes with
a price tag. Ifyou can afford about $125 per month for your
real-time charts (more if you want futures data), then there
are three packages I can recommend: Quote.com, eSignal,
and RealTick. I’ve used all three services, and while there
are a few minor differences between them, I don’t have a
clear favorite. These services will take some time to get used
to if you have been trading on a more scaled-down format.
Once you get used to it, though, you’ll wonder how you ever
traded on anything less. If you plan on day trading any of
our trend-trading systems, then I strongly recommend
going with either of these two premium services.
There are many other forms of trading software you
can purchase, but I’m convinced that other than your bro-
ker’s trading platform, a basic membership with Stockcharts
.com, and a real-time charting package, there is nothing else
you need for trading profitably. However, there are traders for
whom research is half the fun of trading. For them there is
no shortage of software and Web-based services one can
purchase or subscribe to that will seemingly enhance their
ability to investigate every possible technical, economic,
cyclical, and fundamental angle of the markets.



==================================================
                     PAGE 54                      
==================================================

WHAT YOU NEED TO GET STARTED 35
Two such services I can recommend are MetaStock,
which is a high-end package that, among other things, will
allow you to backtest your technical trading systems, and
VectorVest, which analyzes and ranks the universe of stocks
every day according to certain fundamental and technical
parameters. Again, however, to trade well all you really
need to spend is between $10 and $50 per month for the
few basic services listed here.
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS
When it comes to Internet service providers these days,
you have a lot of choices. There is dial-up, high-speed dial-
up, HSDN, DSL, satellite broadband, cable broadband,
and T-1 lines. I’ve always used a cable ISP and would not
want to trade on anything slower. But then, I do a fair
amount of day trading where speed and a constant flow of
data are essential.
Many subscribers to our BTTT Newsletters trade
with dial-up and do just fine. To enter your trade orders
and monitor your open positions, dial-up is normally suf-
ficient. Fortunately, trading hours for most U.S. time zones
at least do not coincide with those dreaded “porn hours”
(late evening) when the phone lines get jammed and data
runs slowly. If you are a subscriber to one of our newslet-
ters (or any newsletter service, for that matter), you won’t
need the surfing speed required to do all the stock research.
However, if you plan on doing your own research—
running your market scans and checking your watch lists
each day—you will save yourself countless hours of surf
time by switching to a broadband provider of some kind.



==================================================
                     PAGE 55                      
==================================================

36 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
I am on the road a lot during the year and nearly
always stay in hotels that have high-speed Internet access,
but occasionally I have to resort to using dial-up. It works
just fine as long as you don’t need to be lightning fast when
entering and exiting trades. I also recommend keeping a
dial-up service installed and paid for as a backup during
those inevitable times when your cable or other higher-
speed service goes on the blink. To this end, I can recom-
mend using NetZero’s high-speed dial-up service. For $15
per month you have the security of knowing that you are
only a phone line away from being able to put on and take
off trades.
One final option to look into is a satellite service that
runs through your wireless phone connected by modem to
your laptop. This can be a bit expensive, with monthly
costs running up to near $100, and in the recent past they
were too slow to be cost effective. However, the current
versions are much faster, and with this setup you can take
your laptop nearly anywhere in the world and set up your
trading workstation.
ONLINE BROKERS
Just a few quick words about your online broker: you need
a good one, an inexpensive one, and one whose system for
inputting trades you are comfortable with. In my years of
trading, I’ve used most of the popular online brokerages:
Schwab, Datek, E*Trade, Suretrade, Scottrade, Investrade,
Interactive Brokers, and MB Trading (some of these are no
longer in operation). All offer discount pricing—though



==================================================
                     PAGE 56                      
==================================================

WHAT YOU NEED TO GET STARTED 37
some are more discounted than others—and user-friendly
trading and account management interfaces.
Currently I have a personal account with Interactive
Brokers (IB) and trade the Befriend the Trend Fund through
a prime broker (Goldman Sachs, which uses the REDIPlus
platform). I recommend IB to anyone. I have found them to
be reliable and inexpensive ($1 or less per 100 shares traded),
and their account management system is user friendly. Some
people, however, find their Trader Workstation, which is
where you input your trades, cumbersome and confusing.
A recommended alternative is MB Trading. They offer
the same price structure as Interactive Brokers, but they
also offer a $9.95-per-trade option for unlimited shares.
This is an attractive option for larger accounts or those
trading penny stocks. Generally I find their MBT Naviga-
tor, where trades are inputted, to be slightly more user
friendly than IB’s Trader Workstation, though IB’s recent
upgrades to their system make the differences between the
two formats minimal.

becoming a
chart reader
I
N the chapters that follow, I am going to reveal exactly
what I look for when I select new trades to be included in
the various Befriend the Trend Trading newsletters. An
important point to remember: selecting stocks to trade is
the easy part. Knowing when to enter and exit is the hard-
est part, and the most important part, of trading. Both how
to enter and how to exit your positions will be discussed in
detail here.
Before we get to the nuts and bolts of how you can
actually begin to put your money to work in the markets,
however, we first need to discuss the most important ele-
ment of all trading that is based on technical analysis: the
price chart. In this section I will tell you exactly how I set
up and read the charts I use for selecting new trades and
monitoring open positions.
THE INDICATORS
The first thing you should do is set up your default chart
with all the indicators and parameters you will need to
make technically sound trading selections. For myself, I use

two sets of charts: I make frequent reference to a delayed
charting service offered by Stockcharts.com and consider
their charts to be the best Web-based service available.
With their basic subscription (about $10 per month), you
can set up your charts with all the parameters and indica-
tors I teach here as well as screen for the setups taught later
in the book. Their charts are also easy to read and can be
formatted to suit a variety of aesthetic tastes. Recently,
Stockcharts.com added real-time data to their subscription
service for a small additional monthly charge. While the
charts do not update instantly as they do in the premium
services listed previously, you can set the charts to update
automatically every 15 seconds.
The second package I use is eSignal’s premium chart-
ing service with real-time stocks, options, and futures data.
With eSignal you can input an infinite number of watch
lists, and with a simple click of the mouse you can scroll
through these easily in real time. While the package I sub-
scribe to is fairly expensive and constitutes a considerable
overhead cost, the advantages it affords are worth it. With
the eSignal premium package, you can get automatically
updating charts with real time in all time frames, and with
what I consider to be the most readable format available.
If you use eSignal or a similar service, like Quote.com
or RealTick, for your charting needs, you have the oppor-
tunity to set up several charts that will simultaneously dis-
play different time periods for the same stock symbol. At
the click of the mouse, you can change from stock to stock
as you view weekly, daily, and various intraday charts for
each stock side by side. Less sophisticated charting pack-
ages such as IQCharts and TC2000 also allow for multiple

                     PAGE 60                      
==================================================

BECOMING A CHART READER 41
charts in different time frames, but the linkages between
them are not as intuitive and are often buggy and unstable.
For most trading purposes this is sufficient, but where you
need the edge of split-second decision making, there is no
substitute for higher quality.
Whatever charting service you use, you should add
the following indicators to your default chart:
• Simple moving averages (SMAs): 20 MA, 50 MA,
200 MA
• Moving average convergence-divergence
(MACD): 12–26–9 periodicity
• Stochastics: 5–3 (or 5–3–3) periodicity
• On balance volume (OBV)
• Relative strength index (RSI): 5 periodicity
• Commodity channel index (CCI): 20 periodicity
If you are confused at this point, don’t worry. Here is
a simple primer on what these indicators mean and how
they tend to be used.
Simple Moving Averages (SMAs):
20, 50, and 200 Settings
• Theory: An MA measures the consensus, or
average, closing price of a stock over a given
period of time. A 20 setting shows the average
price over 20 days, and so on. A simple MA is one
that takes an equally weighted average of price.
• Reading the indicator: SMAs represent price
consensus over a given period of time. When



==================================================
                     PAGE 61                      
==================================================

42 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
price gets too far away from the consensus, it
tends to revert to that consensus like a magnet. In
turn, SMAs tend to act as barriers to price,
putting a stop to any trend that runs into it.
SMAs also indicate trend: if they are sloped up,
the price trend is up (bullish). If they are sloped
down, the price trend is down (bearish). If the
slope is sharp, the trend is strong, and if the slope
is shallow, the trend is weak. A flat or choppy
SMA indicates a range-bound market.
• Uses:
1. To show areas of support and resistance
2. To determine the direction and strength of the
current trend
• Chart example: Figure 2.1 shows the S&P 500
proxy (SPY) with both the 20 (dotted line) and
the 50 (solid line) SMAs overlaid. Note how the
Figure 2.1 Dow Jones Industrial Average with 20/50 SMAs.



==================================================
                     PAGE 62                      
==================================================

BECOMING A CHART READER 43
upward slope on the left of the chart confirms the
uptrend in price and acts as support for that
uptrend, while the right of the chart shows the
SMAs confirming a breakdown in price. The flat
50 SMA in the right third of the chart indicates a
choppy, range-bound market.
Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
(MACD): 12–26–9 Periodicity with
Histogram (a Bar Graph of Daily
MACD Readings) Overlay
• Theory: MACD measures the difference between a
shorter-term consensus of price and a longer-term
consensus, and works on the assumption that when
these diverge, the current price trend is increasing
in strength, and when they converge, the trend is
decreasing in strength. The periodicity settings
represent the following: a 12-day moving average
of price (short-term), a 26-day moving average
(longer-term), and a 9-day average of the
difference between the two averages.
• Reading the indicator: Positive MACD readings
(above the 0-line) indicate that bulls are in charge
of the market, while readings below the 0-line
indicate that bears are in charge. The length of
the histogram bars can be used to determine the
strength of trends: the longer the bars, the
stronger the trend (and vice versa). Also, both the
MACD signal lines and the MACD histogram
can be used to show bullish or bearish divergence



==================================================
                     PAGE 63                      
==================================================

44 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
from price, which can give tradable signals (the
term divergence will be explained later).
Crossovers from positive to negative MACD
readings, and vice versa, do not offer reliable
trading signals, since they tend to lag the market.
• Uses:
1. As a contrarian indicator when it diverges from
price
2. To determine the strength or weakness of price
trends
3. To determine whether a market is currently
bullish or bearish
• Chartexample:In Figure 2.2, the SPY has the
MACD below it, showing an interesting relation-
ship between indicator and price. Note how as
Figure 2.2 SPY with MACD indicator.



==================================================
                     PAGE 64                      
==================================================

BECOMING A CHART READER 45
the uptrend matures, MACD fails to putin new
highs even as price does so. This indicates relative
weakness,or bearishdivergence. Also note the moves
above and below the 0-line with respect to price
moves. Clearly these shifts cannotbe used as
trading signals since they come too late to catch
the move, but they are valuable in indicating the
overall mood (bullish or bearish) of the stock’s
price.
Stochastics: 5 (%K), 3 (%D) Settings
• Theory: Stochastics measures the relationship
between the most recent closing price and the
total price range (highs to lows) over a given
period of time. A declining stochastics indicates
that price is tending to close near the lower end of
its recent trading range (bearish), while a rising
stochastics indicates that price is tending to close
near the upper end of its recent trading range
(bullish). %D is a moving average of %K values
over a given period.
• Reading the indicator: Stochastics gives a clear buy
signal once it passes below the 20-line (oversold)
and then %K crosses over %D. It gives a clear
sell signal once it passes above the 80-line
(overbought) and then %K crosses under %D.
• Uses:
1. To register overbought and oversold levels
in price
2. To register entry and exit signals for trend
trades

==================================================

Figure 2.3 SPY with stochastics indicator.
3. As a contrarian indicator when it diverges from
price
• Chart example: In Figure 2.3, the SPY has the
stochastics (5–3) below it. Note how dips to or
below the 20-line (oversold) often precede sharp
upward thrusts in price. The signals to sell over
the 80-line (overbought) are less reliable during
the uptrend, but offer profitable trading
opportunities once the index shows some
weakness in the overall trend.
On Balance Volume (OBV)
• Theory: Since OBV is measured by adding the
volume of an up day to a running total of volume



==================================================
                     PAGE 66                      
==================================================

BECOMING A CHART READER 47
and subtracting the volume of a down day from
that total, it gives us a pictorial image of whether
a stock is being accumulated (more shares being
bought than sold) or distributed (more shares sold
than bought) over time. A rising OBV indicates
accumulation, while a falling OBV indicates
distribution.
• Reading the indicator: If a price trend is confirmed
by supportive volume, OBV will move in concert
with price, making new highs or lows along with
new price highs or lows. When it does so, OBV
confirms the current trend. When it does not,
OBV acts as a contrarian indicator. OBV
sometimes acts as a leading indicator: if it rises
ahead of price, price tends to follow; and vice
versa if it falls ahead of price.
• Uses:
1. To confirm the validity of current trends and
breakout moves
2. As a contrarian indictor signaling false
breakouts and weakening trends
3. As a leading indicator useful to taking positions
in breakouts prior to the breakout move
• Chart example: In Figure 2.4, the SPY has OBV
below it. OBV is used to confirm price trends, so
as long as OBV is making new highs, the bullish
price trend should be bought. But note how OBV
gave a divergence warning in late February when
it failed to print a new high as price was hitting
new highs. The market sold off sharply right after
that. The OBV was right—traders were
distributing their shares.

==================================================

Figure 2.4 SPY with the OBV indicator.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): 5-Period Setting
• Theory: RSI is measured by dividing an average of
net positive changes in closing prices over a given
period of time by an average of net negative
changes in price. As this number increases over
time, a bullish trend is confirmed. When the
number decreases, a bearish trend is confirmed.
• Reading the indicator: RSI should move in concert
with price during major trends. When RSI
diverges from price, this represents a tradable
situation and may indicate a top or bottom to the
current trend. A reading above 70 indicates
overbought levels in price, while a reading below
30 indicates oversold levels in price.

1. As a contrarian indicator, foreshadowing
potential reversals of trend
2. To confirm the validity of the current trend or
price breakout
3. To register overbought and oversold levels in
price
• Chart example: In Figure 2.5, the SPY has RSI
below it. Like other oversold-overbought
indicators, RSI can be used profitably to alert us
to buy and sell signals, but only when other

factors are in place. As a stand-alone indicator, it
is best used to show divergence. On the chart in
Figure 2.5, we can see clear bearish divergence to
price in late February and bullish divergence in
the middle of March.
Commodity Channel Index (CCI):
20-Period Setting
• Theory: CCI is calculated by dividing price
increases or decreases over a period of time by a
mean standard deviation of a consensus or average
of price over time. The resulting plotted line of
this calculation will give visual readings of the
strength of current trends as well as indicate
“hidden” strength or weakness during relatively
flat market periods.
• Reading the indicator: Extreme high and low
(cid:1) −
readings in the CCI indicator ( 200/ 200) are
used by some traders to signal price waves or
cycles. The indicator can also be used, like other
single line indicators (RSI, OBV), to signal buys
and sells when the indicator diverges from price.
Like other indicators, CCI can be a leading
indicator when it diverges from price. A relatively
flat market with a rising or falling CCI can signal
future direction in price.
• Uses:
1. As a contrarian indicator, foreshadowing poten-
tial reversals of trend
2. To confirm the validity of the current trend

3. To indicate the beginning and end of price
waves or cycles within a larger trend
• Chart example: In Figure 2.6, SPY has the CCI
indicator below it. Again like the RSI indicator,
we see bearish divergence in late February
and bullish divergence in mid-March. What
is unique about CCI is its ability to pinpoint
cycle changes. The extreme bearish reading we
see at the end of February and beginning of
March signals a change of cycle. The short-
lived bearish cycle is likely over, and a new
bullish cycle has begun.

So that’s it. These “sexy six” are the only indicators I
use consistently in all my trend-trading systems. There are
other indicators I occasionally use, such as a five-period
exponential MA coupled with an eight-period SMA,
Bollinger Bands, ADX, and Money Flow, but these are used
mostly in special-case trading situations that fall outside
the parameters of ordinary, everyday trend-trading strate-
gies. For most trend-trading purposes, the preceding list is
sufficient.
SETTING UP YOUR CHART
Now it is time to set up your chart. The foregoing gives
you a list of all the indicators you should put on your pri-
mary chart, along with the specific settings. These indica-
tors and settings will remain the same whether you are
looking at weekly, daily, or intraday charts. The trend-
trading systems you will learn in this book can be applied
to all time frames, depending on your trading preferences
and goals. But for the purposes of simplicity, we will limit
our examples to the daily chart.
Some of these indicator settings are configured to the
standard default setting you get with most charting appli-
cations. But several (stochastics, RSI, CCI) have been set
to a more sensitive reading, which better supports what we
are trying to do with trend trading. You can fiddle around
with these numbers if you want to, but I recommend at
least trying the settings I use first.
Figure 2.7 is a chart of the S&P 500 proxy SPY (Spy-
ders) with all the aforementioned indicators. Take note of
several things.

54 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
1. First, look at how the MAs (20, 50, and 200) went
from a period of up and down confusion, crossing
over each other and not giving much of an
indication of trend, to a period where all three are
sharply rising, with the 20 (dotted line) over the
50 (thick solid line) and the 50 over the 200 (thin
solid line). This change of condition we call a
change from a range-bound to a strongly uptrending
market. Both these terms will be defined in greater
detail in the next section.
2. Note the oversold and overbought conditions of
the RSI, stochastics, and CCI indicators and
compare these values to what price did. Not every
oversold or overbought condition marks a valid
buy or sell signal. Indicators need to be taken
together with other triggers on the price chart
itself. Oversold and overbought conditions can
simply become very oversold or very overbought
before they resolve themselves. As a clear example
of this, compare the consistently overbought
action of stochastics during the month of
November with what price was doing (i.e., going
up and up).
3. Note how the OBV indicator can be played with
trendlines—just like price. A breakout of the
downtrend line in early November signaled the start
of a healthy bull run, while the break of the
uptrend line in mid-January may signal a new
downtrend in price.

4. Note how CCI marked significant cycle changes
(cid:1)(cid:2)
whenever it hit extremes of / 200. Except for the
November high, the other three signals circled on
the chart proved profitable. CCI can also be played
like OBV, with trendlines overlaid. The trendline
break to the upside in mid-October signaled a
buying opportunity.
5. Finally, note the bearish divergence that crept into
the last two months of trading. Note how even
though the SPY price was making new near-term
highs, the RSI and MACD indicators were making
lower highs. This is bearish divergence and flashes a
caution sign to market bulls. Indeed, several weeks
later SPY traded down to near 120.00 before
recovering.
Figure 2.8 is another chart of the S&P 500 proxy,
SPY, from a year earlier than the chart that preceded it.
Here I have highlighted a number of divergences between
price and the various indicators we use. Whenever price
sets a higher high or lower low without the indicators fol-
lowing suit, we have a setup that often foreshadows large
market moves. When divergence is seen between price and
one or more indicators, trend traders will fade the price and
trade in the direction of the indicators. Also note again the
use of trendlines on the OBV indicator and how a break of
those lines can signal a change in price direction. And
finally, take a look at how the indicators, especially sto-
chastics, register oversold and overbought conditions at or
near major market reversals.

BECOMING A CHART READER 57
TRENDLINES AND CHANNEL LINES
It is extremely important in trend trading to determine
whether the market in general, and the stocks on our watch
lists in particular, are in a trend, and if so, what kind of
trend it is. Trendlines and channel lines are among the tools
we use to do this.
Trendlines and channel lines are lines drawn over at
least two tops and under at least two bottoms of major price
movements. The more tops and bottoms you can intersect
with the trendline, the more valid the trend. As a general
rule, we recommend only drawing in a trendline that can
intersect at least three price points. Note that these price
points need not be pivots in price (that is, highs and lows
in price), merely touches of the trendline by individual
price bars.
Trendlines help traders identify the dominant trends
that price has tended to trade within, while channel lines
demarcate trendless channels or trading ranges with sup-
port and resistance points. In short, these lines give us a
simple, visual reference as to whether the stock is in an
uptrend or a downtrend, or is stuck in a trading range. Fur-
thermore, if we extend those lines beyond the right edge
of the chart, we will have a visual map of where the stock
is likely to trade into the near future. Thus, trendlines are
an invaluable tool in helping us to make profitable trading
decisions.
Trendlines are used to measure uptrends by drawing
the lines under the lows, while downtrends are measured
by drawing the lines over the highs. A series of higher lows
indicates that the bears are getting less aggressive and the

bulls more confident. That is all we need to know to call
such movement an uptrend. The reverse is true for a down-
trend. An uptrending line drawn below the lows combined
with a flat line over the highs is still an uptrend. A down-
trending line over the highs combined with a flat line under
the lows is still a downtrend. Again: In an uptrend, only the
lows count. In a downtrend, only the highs count.
The following are theoretical examples of both an
uptrend and a downtrend. Note that the trend is deter-
mined by only one side of the formation: the lows for the
uptrend and the highs for the downtrend. Figure 2.9 is an
example of an uptrend. Figure 2.10 is an example of a
downtrend.
If both trendlines—the one over the highs and the one
under the lows—are flat, the stock is in what we call a trad-
ing channel or trading range. The stock’s price is likely to
bounce up and down between these channel lines until
either the upper or the lower line is broken. If the upper

line is broken, we can expect to see a new uptrend develop.
If the lower channel line is broken, we can expect to see a
new downtrend develop. The same principles apply when
we have an uptrending line under the lows combined with
a downtrending line over the highs. This is still a channel,
but it is now what we call a narrowing channel or a triangle
formation. Any breakout from that formation is a tradable
event.
Figures 2.11 and 2.12 are theoretical examples of the
two most common types of trading ranges or channels.
Both trendlines and channel lines are used in follow-
ing ways:
• To determine the status of a price trend: up,
down, or range-bound
• To project future points of price resistance and
support
• To calculate where to put stop-losses
• To note areas of price containment in order to
predict breakout moves

Figure 2.13 BRCM showing trendlines.
Figure 2.13, the BRCM chart, demonstrates a trad-
ing channel or range in August that broke out to the upside.
This led to choppy trade with short-term up- and down-
trends, which then led to a more prolonged downtrend in
October, followed by a prolonged uptrend into December.
Note that if a position had been taken during either the
channel or any of the trending patterns, the stop-loss for
shorts should have been placed just over the upper trend-
line (dotted line) and a stop-loss for longs just under the
lower trendline (solid line) once the trendline was estab-
lished with at least three points of intersection.
Figure 2.14 is a classic trading range or channel
breakout exhibited by BEAS. The stock bounced up and
down within a 2.00 range for five months before finally
breaking out to the upside. This kind of long-term price
containment with breakout sends the bullish signal that
the stock is now ready to trade within a higher price range.

Figure 2.14 BEAS showing price channel breakout.
Note also that once the price channel was established by
sufficient price touches in late July, the lower trendline,
once extended out to the right, would have been a reason-
able place of support to put a bid in for the stock (and the
same would be true for putting an offer at the upper trend-
line). Note finally that the break of the second established
trading range’s lower trendline in early November signaled
that it was time to exit the trade and bank the profit. This
chart thus represents a potential trend trade return of over
(cid:1)
40 percent in about nine weeks: buying BEAS at trend-
line support (near 11.00) and selling on a trendline break
near 15.50.
Two warnings need to be issued regarding the use
of trend and channel lines. The first is that these lines
are always subjectively drawn. Even when software is
used to draw trendlines, there is subjectivity at work in
the way the programmer coded the software. This is to



==================================================
                     PAGE 81                      
==================================================

62 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
say that you must always be ready to alter your trend-
lines in response to new market data. It is all too easy
to draw in a trend channel where none really exists
because we have a predisposed bias to the stock moving
in a certain direction. Trendlines and wishful thinking
are a dangerous combination. For this reason, always
apply the following rule to your use of trend and chan-
nel lines:
No trend or trading channel exists until a line can
be placed on the chart that intersects at least
three price points. Two price points can yield a
trendline, but no trading decision should be made
until a third touch of the line is recorded.
There is much debate among market technicians and
traders whether one should run a trend or channel line
over/under intraday prices (the “tails” or “shadows” on the
candlesticks) or only the end-of-day price points. There are
various answers to this question. It has been my general
experience that closing prices trump intraday swings. Thus,
if you draw a trend or channel line across the tops or under
the bottoms of several runs in price, and then find that at
numerous points there are intraday swings in price that
cannot be contained by those lines, it is okay. As long as
you contain within the lines the majority consensus repre-
sented by the closing price (or the edge of the candle body
if you are using candlestick charts), I believe you can more
or less ignore the extreme opinions represented by a few
wayward intraday runs (or tails). Some do prefer, however,
to use lines to contain all points in price, including intra-

day swings. Hence, a sound compromise position on draw-
ing trendlines can be heard in the teaching of Alexander
Elder, who states, “. . . It is better to draw [the line]
through the edges of congestion areas. Those edges show
where the majority of traders have reversed direction.”
(Elder, p. 88)
In Figure 2.15, the chart of RIMM demonstrates
Elder’s trendline technique in action. Here we see a down-
trend line and subsequent uptrend line passing through
areas of price congestion rather than at either intraday or
end-of-day price points.
A second warning with respect to trend and channel
lines is that traders often have the tendency to draw too
many of them. If we keep in mind that such lines are
merely accidental tools we use to give us a very general
sense of price containment and are not nearly as mathe-
maticallyelegantandpreciseastheotherindicatorsmen-
tioned previously, we will then have a better attitude

itive or exclusive trading decisions, we can be tempted to
draw in lines under and over every little zigzag in price
movement, projecting ahead onto the right edge of the
chartmyriadcompetingandconflictinglines.Acharttoo
full of trend and channel lines will only lead to indeci-
sion.
The following one-year chart of QQQQ (Figure
2.16) demonstrates well how you can get too carried away
with trend and channel lines. Just how are you supposed to
get a solid read of this chart?
It is best, therefore, to use trendlines only to give us
the big picture. When in doubt, remember KISS (Keep It
Simple, Stupid!). In other words, try to incorporate as
many highs and lows (price point touches) as possible as
you draw your lines and try to contain as much price action
as possible. Use trendlines only to focus on major trends
and channels, and, as we will see in greater detail later, they
will become very useful tools indeed.

EYEBALLING THE CHARTS
Now that you have your charts set up, input each of the
stocks on your primary watch list so that you can eyeball,
or take a quick glance at, their daily charts. Don’t worry if
you do not yet have a watch list of stocks set up to moni-
tor. In Chapter 9, I will show you how to set up an awe-
some watch list of the best stocks available for trend
trading, and how to keep this list updated over time so that
you always have only the best markets available to you.
Here, I just want to introduce you to what will soon
become a daily discipline for you: eyeballing the charts for
current or developing setups.
Depending on which charting package you use, you
can go through your watch lists, 10 at a time, page by page,
or you can scroll through a drop-down menu of your watch
list stocks and with the click of the mouse call up the daily
chart for each one. Some charting packages will even let
you set up a slide-show function that will scroll automati-
cally through your lists for you. You simply sit back, watch,
and take notes. It should be said that one advantage to sav-
ing your watch lists in a Web-based service rather than
your charting package is that then if you, like me, trade
from different computers, you will always have instant
access to your watch lists through the Web. If your watch
lists are saved only to your charting software, you will only
be able to access your lists from the computer they are
saved on unless you take the time to export and import the
lists (a lot more easily said than done!).
Sometimes it is helpful to take your primary watch list
and divide it into smaller lists. There are several ways to do



==================================================
                     PAGE 85                      
==================================================

66 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
this. You can, for example, divide by sector, by price, by
index affiliation, or by some other scheme. I prefer to divide
by sector, since I regularly monitor sector charts and like
to key my trades off them. If, for example, I see the semi-
conductor sector flashing a fresh buy signal, I’ll go to my
semiconductor watch list and focus only on those stocks.
The same is true for steel stocks, financials, Internets,
China stocks, alternative energy plays, and so on. You can
also make saved watch lists of those stocks that turn up on
your special screens, as outlined later, but that have not yet
given buy or sell signals. In any case, you will run through
these watch lists at the end of each trading day, looking for
new setups.
The eyeballing process is the bread and butter of
trend traders. As technical analysts, our primary source of
input is the price chart.The only way to receive that input
is to lay your eyes on a number of them, day in and day out.
Tune out the news, tune out CNBC, tune out the spam
e-mail for “Hot stocks moving now!,” tune out your buddy
at the gym who has a hot stock tip. Your complete and
entire investment discipline requires only that you eyeball
the charts.
It is also important that before you begin eyeballing
the charts on your primary watch list, you first ask your-
self, “What do I expect the broader markets to do over the
next few days?” If you expect a bullish period, then you will
be eyeballing primarily for bullish setups. If you expect a
bearish period, then you will be eyeballing primarily for
bearish setups. If you are unsure about the general market
direction, then you will be eyeballing for both bullish and
bearish setups. (Don’t worry if you don’t yet know how to

determine the general trend expectations of the broader
markets. We will be covering that later.)
THE HERMENEUTICAL PROBLEM
I wrote my doctoral dissertation at Oxford on hermeneu-
tics, the study of how the mind understands and applies
the content of written texts. One of the things we can
learn from this study is that no one reads texts in a vac-
uum. Whether we are reading the Bible or the nightly
newspaper, we each bring our own experiences, biases,
and personal preferences to what we are reading, and
these in turn can influence how we understand and apply
what we read.
A stock chart functions very much like a text. Like a
text, a stock chart speaks to us about something we need to
understand, but instead of using ordinary language, it uses
price bars, candlesticks, moving averages, volume, and
other technical indicators. Together, these are trying to tell
us a story—a story about the underlying company’s suc-
cesses and failures and (if we listen very carefully) the
future prospects of its publicly traded shares. But there is
a problem in our ability to hear clearly what the chart wants
to say to us, and it is a hermeneutical problem. The prob-
lem, simply put, is this: our prejudices (or our “prejudg-
ments”) get in the way.
Let’s say, for example, that you plug into an Apple iPod
at the gym, and you use an Apple Macintosh at the office,
and you do your creative writing at Starbucks on an Apple
MacBook. You are a big fan of Apple’s products. Steve Jobs
is your hero. You genuflect every time you pass the Cuper-

tino exit on Highway 101. Okay, that’s a bit much . . . but
you get the point. You really like the company, think they
can do no wrong, and believe their stock price is going to
go “to da moon,” as they say. These are prejudices, and they
might prevent you from hearing what the stock chart wants
to tell you.
Back in January of 2006, Apple (AAPL) could do no
wrong. It was the darling of the street. Its stock price was
hitting new all-time highs, up near $90 per share. Its prod-
ucts, especially the iPod, were seen everywhere. Rumors
were flying about new products: an iPhone, an i-TV, and
so on. However, the daily chart was trying to say something
that only a few traders were willing to hear: not all was
right with the way the shares were behaving. There were
subtle sell signals forming in key indicators, like the
MACD and stochastics. Sure enough, the next month the
stock options backdating scandal hit the company and
shares plummeted over the next two quarters to $50 (since
then, of course, the iPhone did come out and AAPL shares
ramped up to nearly $150!).
The moral of that story: ignore the hype, ignore the
news, ignore your own prejudices, and just listen to what
the chart is telling you. As much as possible, “bracket your
prejudgments” (to use philosopher Edmund Husserl’s
phrase) and just tune in to the chart. As I like to tell my
trading clients: price and volume—that is all you need to
know to trade well.
Here is another example, but of a different kind.
Broadwing (BWNG) is a company with a multifaceted
footprint in the Internet sector. Through its subsidiaries,

BECOMING A CHART READER 69
the company provides data and Internet, broadband trans-
port, and voice communications services to several large
communications service providers. In late spring of 2006,
the company was hit with a string of events that sent its
earnings and its shares into a tailspin. Earnings announce-
ments failed to meet Street expectations. There were unex-
pected changes in management. With really poor timing,
the company priced a large convertible debenture offering,
which further diluted shares. Price plummeted from a high
of $16.44 to a low of $8.26, for a loss of nearly 50 percent.
Former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer, on his hit CNBC
show Mad Money, called Broadwing a “dog” and told his
audience to sell it.
However, the chart of BWNG told us otherwise. As
price skidded to lows below $10 per share—a point that
normally takes a stock off the radar screen of professional
traders—certain indicators were pointing to the fact that
the stock was under accumulation. Momentum in the
latest sell-offs was waning, and the stock was ripe for a
turnaround. Bullish divergence was seen in several key in-
dicators, telling us it was time to buy, not sell, shares.
Sure enough, three months later, shares had climbed to
$13 per share before they announced they were being
bought out by one of their competitors at a 20 percent
premium.
Again, the moral of the story is this: just check the chart.
If you don’t like the chart, don’t play the shares no matter
what the talking-head experts say. If the Street says sell but
the chart says buy, go with the chart. Always go with the
chart.

To read, understand, and apply what the chart is try-
ing to tell you, you will have to face up to the hermeneu-

them. Ignore them. Tell them to shut up! Just let the chart

developing a

T
HEREare two types of traders who will buy this book,
read it, and put one or more of its systems into practice in
the markets. The first type will be successful, making
money regularly from the markets, while the second type
will consistently lose money until he or she finally gives up
on trading altogether. The sad fact is that most traders will
fall into the second category, and only a small percentage
of those who buy this book will fall into the first category.
What is the difference between these two camps—
between the successful trader and the losing trader? Believe
it or not, the determining factor has nothing to do with
education, nothing to do with innate intelligence, nothing
to do with economic or business smarts. The difference is
strictly psychological. No one can deduce a universal per-
sonality profile from the set of winning traders. Among
successful traders, you will find introverts and extroverts,
feeling types and thinking types, levelheaded automatons
and passionate impulsives. But there are certain traits of
character they hold in common. The trader who success-
fully puts these trading systems into practice is one who
possesses all of the following:

• Self-discipline
• The ability to take responsibility
• A positive attitude toward success
• A keen understanding of risk
• The ability to maintain an open mind
The trader who unsuccessfully puts these trading sys-
tems into practice is more than likely lacking in one or
more of the these qualities of character. Note that these are
qualities of character, not personality. Attend any one of the
three annual U.S. Trader’s Expo symposia at which gather
hundreds of wildly successful stock, options, and futures
traders, and you will find every possible personality type
represented (including some that probably should be on
medication). But you will also find a narrow range of char-
acter traits—those listed here—that serve the trading
career well.
In short, one’s character or state of mind has a lot
more to do with trading success than one’s personality. I
won’t be saying too much about this topic, since there are
many excellent resources available that can give you a much
more detailed education. But what I have to say here might,
in fact, be the most important part of this book. As the
long-term successful trader you long to be, it is essential
that you pay attention to the psychological side of your
trading. You may have the world’s most robust, most prof-
itable trend-trading system at hand, but if fear, anxiety,
panic, laziness, greed, or some other unhelpful mental state
dominates your frame of thinking, you are much less likely
to make that system work for you. Even 100 percent
mechanical systems require a human hand to pull the trig-

ger at each new signal. Like it or not, that hand is connected
to a brain that makes it work.
CONTROLLING EMOTION
Contrary to popular opinion, there is not a specific emo-
tional archetype that is ideal for the successful trader. Some
portray the ideal trader as an emotionless robot, with ice
for blood and a computer for a brain. But the truth is,
highly profitable traders come in all sorts of emotional vari-
eties. Think of Jim Cramer, the screaming, saliva-spewing
host of CNBC’s popular Mad Moneyshow. Cramer is any-
thing but emotionless, and by most accounts (including his
own) his turn as a hedge fund manager was very success-
ful. No, it’s really not essential to trading that you curb
your emotional enthusiasm and trade like a machine.
Indeed, I believe that a passionate feeling for the markets,
a “fire in the belly,” is a real plus for the trader. What else
is going to keep you coming back day after day to the
tedious, often boring research that needs to be done? What
else will get you back in the game after a losing streak?
What is essential is not rooting out all emotion while
you are trading—an impossible task, in any case—but man-
aging your emotions as they arise. When emotions cause
impulsive trading, trading against the plan, trading against
your best instincts, experience, and education, they are
problematic. Any emotional state that undermines confi-
dence in your edge as a trader will pose serious obstacles
to your success. With the trading systems outlined in this
book, you now have your edge on the markets. But that
edge is worthless if it is not managed appropriately. As Ed

Seykota, the great futures trader, likes to say (and I para-
phrase), trading is mostly about numbers, but once you’ve
mastered the numbers, it’s all about psychology.
The primary cause of failure in trading is not a bad
trading system but bad trading psychology. Good trading
psychology can best be defined as any mental condition that
allows you enough confidence in your trading and money
management strategies to hang on to your winners and cut
short your losers. The first act, hanging on to winners,
requires the trader to possess a state of mind that is com-
fortable with success and that avoids self-sabotage. The lat-
ter act, keeping losses small, requires a hard-nosed realism,
an appreciation for risk, a mind open to the possibility that
you are wrong, and the self-discipline to stick with prede-
termined exit rules.
Developing this kind of winning trading attitude is no
small task. Fortunately, there are several excellent resources
available that have helped thousands of traders do just that.
The first book I recommend is Mark Douglas’s best-selling
Trading in the Zone. I believe this to be the best resource
currently available for helping traders develop the right
attitude toward the markets they are trading. Douglas is
president of Trading Behavior Dynamics, Inc., which devel-
ops seminars on trading psychology for brokerages, banks,
and money managers. Douglas emphasizes that having a
healthy respect for risk, a willingness to think in terms of
probabilities instead of certainties, and an open mind
toward whatever market expectations you may have are
essential ingredients in the winner’s mindset.
Douglas has conveniently included a trader’s person-
ality inventory test (it is better termed a “character inven-

tory” test) in his book. Once this test is assessed, you will
have a clear idea where you might be stuck emotionally and
in terms of your core beliefs—that is, the test uncovers
those specific mental attitudes that are the cause of so much
trading failure. Douglas is convinced that as you align your
core beliefs as a trader with what can rightly be expected
from the markets over time, you will have the mental appa-
ratus in place to take just about any trading system to the
heights of success.
Here is how Douglas himself describes the essence of
his work in Trading in the Zone:
As long as you are susceptible to the kinds of
errors that are the result of rationalizing, justify-
ing, hesitating, hoping, and jumping the gun, you
will not be able to trust yourself. Ifyou can’t trust
yourself to be objective and to always act in your
own best interests, achieving consistent results will
be next to impossible. ... The irony is that, when
you have the appropriate attitude, when you have
acquired a “trader’s mind-set” and can remain
confident in the face ofconstant uncertainty, trad-
ing will be as easy and simple as you probably
thought it was when you first started out. So, what
is the solution? You will need to learn how to
adjust your attitudes and beliefs about trading in
such a way that you can trade without the slight-
est bit of fear, but at the same time keep a frame-
work in place that does not allow you to become
reckless. That’s exactly what this book is designed
to teach you (Douglas, p. 15).

76 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
A second resource I can recommend is the longer,
more complex work of Van K. Tharp, entitled Trade Your
Way to Financial Freedom. Despite the title, Tharp’s book
does not outline a specific set of trading systems you can
use to trade for a living. Instead, Tharp focuses on what it
takes—mentally, emotionally, philosophically—to develop,
trade, and stick with your own trading methodology. His
essential point is that trading systems need to be matched
to trading temperaments, so the better you can under-
stand what kind of person you are, the better the trader
you will be.
In a chapter Tharp admits to be “the most difficult to
understand,” the author outlines six variables that must be
taken into account in any winning trading system: reliabil-
ity, profit-to-loss ratio, transaction costs, trade frequency,
initial account size, and position sizing. Tharp carefully
outlines the importance of each of these variables, then
relates them to the concept of expectancy, or what sort of
returns you can reasonably expect a trading system to pro-
duce over time. As these variables change within a partic-
ular trading strategy, so will what can be expected of the
strategy in terms of its returns. Consequently, with a sim-
ple tweaking of these variables, you can work toward a cus-
tomized optimization of your trading system based on your
particular trading psychology and objectives.
Tharp has over 20 years’ experience working with
individual and institutional traders as a consultant for the
development of trading systems. He also manages a com-
pany, the International Institute of Trading Mastery, Inc.,
that produces home seminars on systems development and
testing. Tharp’s Web site (www.iitm.com) contains a wealth

of resources for traders, including a free trading personal-
ity test and simulated trading game. Tharp nicely summa-
rizes his trading philosophy in these words taken from the
conclusion to Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom:
First, you cannot trade the markets—you can
only trade your beliefs about the market. As a
result, it is important for you to determine
exactly what those beliefs are. Second, certain
key beliefs, which have nothing to do with the
market, will determine your success in the mar-
kets. Those are your beliefs about yourself. What
do you think you are capable of doing? Is trad-
ing for success important to you? How worthy of
success do you believe yourself to be? Weak
beliefs about yourself can undermine trading
with a great system (Tharp, pp. 322–323).
VALUES-BASED TRADING
The last resource I’d like to mention is a book that makes
no mention of trading but has tremendous application
to cultivating a healthy trading psychology. The book
made its appearance in late 2005 and quickly rose to the
top of the New York Timesbest-seller list. Early in 2006 the
author was interviewed by Time magazine.* Needless to
say, the impact of the book has been tremendous. Not only
have the author’s teachings been taken up by the general
* John Cloud, “Happiness Isn’t Normal,” Time,February 13, 2006. Much
ofthe description ofAcceptance and Commitment Therapy in what
follows is taken from this article.

public, they have also caused an important reassessment—
though not without debate—of traditional psychological
therapies.
The book is provocatively titled Get Out of Your Mind
and Into Your Life. Its author, Steven Hayes, is a professor
of psychology at the University of Nevada—Reno. After
suffering from a series of unexpected panic attacks—so
severe that he couldn’t properly teach his classes—Hayes
pursued research into various models of therapy designed
to overcome depression and anxiety. It seemed natural that
Hayes, as former president of the Association of Behavioral
and Cognitive Therapies, would turn to these dominant
schools of psychology to treat himself. But he soon found
that neither behavioral nor cognitive modification could
effectively treat his particular illness. Hayes then began to
incorporate the Eastern practice of mindfulness into his
therapy, with positive results. To this he also added the dis-
cipline of consciously committing himself, not to what his
emotions dictated, but to the values that matter most to
him, to his personal convictions and beliefs. And with this
amalgam came his healing—and a new form of psycholog-
ical therapy as well.
What Hayes had discovered during his experiments
in self-healing came to be called Acceptance and Commit-
ment Therapy (ACT). Today ACT stands alongside the
psychoanalytical, behavioral, and cognitive schools of ther-
apy as the next big wave in psychotherapeutic practice.
ACT has generated an impressive pedigree of clinical sup-
port, with healing claims for everything from addictions to
schizophrenia. Skeptics dismiss it as a passing fad, but there
is a growing contingent of professional counselors who are



==================================================
                     PAGE 98                      
==================================================

DEVELOPING A TRADER’S MIND 79
embracing its primary mantra: Accept who you are and com-
mit yourself to who you want to become.
So how does ACT work, and of what use is it to trad-
ing? In short—you will have to read Get Out of Your Mind
for the full version—ACT proposes that whenever we have
a negative thought, instead of deprogramming it as cogni-
tive therapy suggests, we should embrace it. We are to
acknowledge the thought with attention and mindfulness,
for as we do so, Hayes insists, we distance ourselves from
the thought and therefore negate its power. So, for exam-
ple, instead of saying, “I am depressed,” we are to say, “I
am having the thought that I’m depressed.” In this way the
thought becomes something I have rather than something
I am. As such, it is much more easily discarded.
The second step in ACT, then, is to commit yourself
to what you most value. Having mindfully defused the
power of the negative thought, you must then just step out
in faith into what is believed to be the right course ofaction,
even if your emotions are not supportive. To facilitate this
commitment, Hayes recommends spending quality time
outlining your personal philosophy (or philosophies) oflife,
what you value most highly, what you want to accomplish
before dying, and so on. This then gives you a kind of road
map to follow during the darker times.
I am incredibly excited about the possibility of apply-
ing this new therapy to trading. Here is how I envision
ACT being used by the active trader: imagine that every
time you have a negative thought about your trading, you
were also able to detach yourself from, and thus defuse, the
thought before it affected your trading decisions. I know
how negative the trader’s mind can be at times. I have per-



==================================================

==================================================

sonally experienced the waves of regret, fear, anxiety, and
anger that come with every tick of the tape when it goes
against your position. How helpful would it be if you could
find a way to negate these emotional waves, and thus free
yourself to follow your system strictly and profitably!
Now imagine that you have written down somewhere
near your trading station a list of your commitments as a
trader. As for me, I have a number of bright yellow sticky
notes pasted to my monitor with pithy, bold, all-caps state-
ments on them. These include:
• Trade only your own picks!
• Never average down!
• Let winners run!
• Cut losses short!
• No impulse buys or sells!
You can probably guess that behind each of these
statements lies a terribly embarrassing, losing trade that
motivated me in absolute horror to write out a maxim and
slap it to the monitor. You can also likely imagine that
behind each of these commitment statements lies a partic-
ular value, something that I highly honor and desire as a
trader. My own list of trading values looks something like
this:
• Your trading systems are sound and profitable.
• You are in control of your impulses.
• Trade with integrity at all times.
• Trade responsibly for your family’s financial
future.

==================================================

DEVELOPING A TRADER’S MIND 81
• Trading is only a means to an end.
• Profits come with the system, not with hunches.
Now imagine that these and other trading values were
to govern my every trading decision—how much better a
trader I would be! Thus, regardless of what I am feeling
emotionally, as I detach myself from those impulsive feel-
ings that so often foul up my trading decisions I am free to
follow a structured road map of my own design, hammered
out by the hard-won experience of years of trading. This
is the promise of ACT when applied to trading: its tools
help me to clear and focus my mind so that I can commit
myself to following my system despite how I’m feeling
about a particular trade.
So what if you don’t have a set of trading rules or val-
ues for yourself? What if you are not sure what personal
psychological frame of thinking is most suited to active
trading? This is where the Douglas and Tharp books are
helpful. Together, they will provide for you that emotional
blueprint you need to follow as you construct your trader’s
mind.

B
ACK in the winter of 2003 I held an online seminar for
several hundred of our clients, most of whom were rela-
tively new to trading. In two grueling four-hour sessions
we covered the basics of chart reading, candlesticks, and
trend trading. I also included a full explanation of two
never-before-taught trend trading setups that I had been
working on the previous year. During the question-and-
answer period, however, I was surprised to find that most
of the concerns of the audience had little to do with the
logistics of trend trading and more to do with the specific
details of my trading approach. In order to answer those
questions as precisely as possible, I promised my clients that
I would write up my trading rules and send them each a
copy.
The following list is a replica of that original set of
rules I sent my clients. None of the rules have changed
since then, though some of their applications have gotten
a bit more sophisticated. As always with trading, there are
exceptions allowed, as dictated by current market condi-
tions.

THE 10 HABITS OF HIGHLY
SUCCESSFUL TRADERS
1. Follow the Rule of Three. There are many indica-
tors a technical analyst uses to determine whether or not to
take a particular trade. There are patterns the price bars
make on the chart; there are moving averages of price;
there are various momentum and overbought/oversold
indicators as well. Together, these form a pictorial descrip-
tion of where a stock’s current price is, relative to its price
history. My Rule of Three says that I will not enter any
trade unless I can carefully articulate three reasons from
among my list of technical indicators for doing so. Three
is the minimum, and more is better. So often young trad-
ers take a trade for only one reason: a double bottom, for
example, or overbought stochastics. These indicators need
to be confirmed by others working in tandem. Conflicting
indicators signal a confused market. We don’t want that.
We want to enter on conviction, not confusion. So always
wait until you can satisfy the Rule of Three (at least).
Remember, trading is a game of probabilities, and you
should always stack the odds in your favor.
2. Keep losses small. Bernard Baruch, the great Wall
Street speculator from the turn of the last century, once
said, “Even being right three or four times out of ten
should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut
his losses quickly.” Baruch was right. It is important to keep
losses to a minimum, as most large losses started out as
small ones, and large losses can end your trading perma-
nently. Normally, we keep our losses small by setting stop-
losses on all open trades. We do this on all trades that we



==================================================
                     PAGE 104                     
==================================================

THE 10 HABITS OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL TRADERS 85
are not monitoring on a minute-by-minute basis; other-
wise, we will keep a mental stop in place and exit the posi-
tion once that price level is violated. Remember Warren
Buffett’s Rule #1: “Don’t Lose Money!” Buffett also made
a second rule: “Don’t forget Rule #1!” So take a tip from
the world’s greatest investor and always strive to keep your
losses small.
3. Adjust stops and targets at the end of the day. At
the end of each trading day, on a high-watermark basis,
adjust your stop-loss or target price as needed. Here “high
water mark” means you adjust either the stop or target only
if the closing price sets a new high or low from the point
of entry. This is how it works: raise your stop-loss price at
each new closing high since entry (or new low if the trade
is a short). And if you are using a target price as an exit,
lower your target price at each new low if the trade goes
against you (or raise at each new high if short). Don’t get
complacent with your trades. Monitor them each day at
least once near the close, and adjust your stops and targets
accordingly. It is also a good idea to take off your stops
overnight to avoid the wide fluctuations of after-hours trad-
ing. But do keep your target orders in place. I like to break
down my target limit order into smaller bits and set them
one penny apart. Occasionally, one or more of these get
filled overnight in the sort of erratic, widely ranging trad-
ing that characterizes the after-hours market.
4. Keep commissions low. Use a discount broker of
your choice that charges a maximum of $10 per trade.
There are several online brokers (OLBs) that charge as lit-
tle as, or even less than, $0.01 per share per trade. You
should not be paying more than this. The qualitative dif-



==================================================
                     PAGE 105                     
==================================================

86 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
ferences between an OLB charging $30 per trade and one
charging $1 per trade are minimal at best. Both will offer
you fast fills, occasional price improvement between the
spread, frills like automatically trailing stops, boxing and
basket orders, and the ability to trade funds, options, and
futures. Why pay a premium for a brand name? Remem-
ber, commissions are part of your overhead costs—and
when running any business, the lower you can keep your
overhead costs, the more profits you get to take to the
bank!
5. Amateurs at the open, pros at the close. What this
familiar trading adage means is that, in general, the well-
funded institutional traders often fade (or trade against) the
morning momentum, happily handing shares to anxious
amateurs, before going off to gorge themselves on a high-
fat lunch. When they get back to their desks around 2:30
p.m. EST, they fully expect to be able to pick up the same
shares at a better price. They are usually right. That’s why
they are professionals. They get paid to be right about
things like that. So if you must trade in the morning, be
sure to ease into your trades in smaller portions. Yes, you
might miss out on some nice moves, but in the long run
you will save yourself money. Even better: look to enter
your trades within the last two hours of trading. In that
way you are more likely to be in sync with the larger and
more determinative moves caused by professional trading.
6.Know the general market trend, and trade accord-
ingly. This is more easily said than done, but it is absolutely
essential to successful trend trading. You need to know
each day what kind of market you are currently trading in.
We will say more about this in Chapter 5. Here the gen-



==================================================
                     PAGE 106                     
==================================================

THE 10 HABITS OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL TRADERS 87
eral rule can be stated that the type of market we are in will
determine the type of trade you put on. There are five gen-
eral types of market trends: weak uptrend, strong uptrend,
weak downtrend, strong downtrend, and range-bound. In
weak uptrends and downtrends, you should focus on con-
tinuation plays; in strong uptrends and downtrends, you
should focus on breakout plays; and in range-bound mar-
kets, you should look for reversal setups. Again, these terms
will be discussed in the next chapter.
You should also ask whether the current trend or
range-bound condition is relatively new or relatively old.
The longer a market persists in its current condition
(uptrend, downtrend, or range-bound), the shorter your
time frame should be for new positions. For example, if we
are in the early weeks of a new bull market, you should feel
comfortable setting a higher target on your long positions.
But if you are long during an overbought market (an older
bull market), you should aim to take quick profits when
given. One quick and easy way to determine the kind of
market we are in is to apply the 50-day moving average of
closing prices to a chart of the S&P 500. Then simply look
at the slope. Is its slope upward (weakly or strongly), down-
ward (weakly or strongly), or flat (range-bound)? Has it
been this way for a while (prolonged), or did it just turn
(new)? And so on.
7.Write down every trade.We keep track of so many
other things in life—the checks we write, the groceries we
need, the donations to charity we make, our golf scores,
the last time we changed the oil in the car—but how many
of us write down the details of every trade we make? In
reading the Market Wizardsbooks by Jack Schwager (which

==================================================

88 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
I highly recommend, by the way), you learn that nearly all
of the wizards keep trading journals. I suggest you do the
same. Make a spreadsheet that records the date of each
trade entry and exit, the symbol of the market traded, the
price of your entry and exit, the size of the trade, the profit
or loss, a running total of profits/losses, and a comment
section where you describe as specifically as possible why
you entered and exited the trade. If you are adept at work-
ing with spreadsheets, you can even program columns to
keep track of your stop-losses, target prices, and position
size.
Analyze these trades at the end of each month. Are
you consistently losing with one particular setup? Are your
breakout plays working better than your reversal plays?
Are your stops set too tight? Use this journal to learn
about your weaknesses as a trader. Awareness of those
weaknesses should soon lead to overcoming them. If you
have any trouble setting up your spreadsheet, e-mail me
at support@befriendthetrend.com, and my staff will be
happy to send you the one I use.
8.Never average down on a losing position.Let’s say
you buy a stock, expecting it to take off like a rocket, and
instead it drops like a rock. What do you do? Answer: you
do nothing. You stick with your plan. You keep your stop-
loss in place, lower your target at the end of the day, and
wait patiently. Do not buy more shares at a lower price to
make your average cost lower. That is a loser’s game. You
already own shares at that price; why buy more? Why
throw good money after bad? Just sit on your hands and let
the market do what it wants. Now the one exception to this
rule is when you are positioning yourself into a trade and

==================================================

THE 10 HABITS OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL TRADERS 89
on your entry day you take advantage of a small dip in share
price. But in this case you must still be favorable toward
the chart, far away from your stop price, and price is show-
ing signs of recovering from its slight dip.
9. Never overtrade. You know the feeling: you’ve
closed out all your overnight trades for a tidy profit and you
say to yourself, hey, I’m on a winning streak, let’s take
advantage of it. So you put on a few more trades. But these
don’t go well, and now you are back to breakeven. You want
those morning profits back, so you put on a few more
trades, only now you go with the e-minis or a few, deep in-
the-money options to leverage your position. These don’t
go well either, and you close the day with a loss. Or per-
haps you start the day by closing out losing positions, and
you overtrade to try to get the money back, only to deepen
your losses on the day. This is the obsessive-compulsive
disorder known as overtrading. It is a problem familiar to
all traders and is rooted in deep-seated feelings of fear and
greed.
The best way to overcome this behavior is to set lim-
its on yourself: when you reach a certain profit point dur-
ing the day, either reduce your position size or just quit.
Better yet, when you reach a certain number of trades dur-
ing the day, just quit. Reward yourself then for your disci-
plined behavior: go sit by the pool, read a good book, take
a bike ride in the woods—just do something nice to rein-
force this discipline until it becomes a habit.
10.Give at least 10 percent of all trading earnings to
charity. The children of John D. Rockefeller were taught
five basic rules regarding money: (a) work for all you get,

cent, (d) live on the rest, (e) and account for every penny.
The Rockefellers believed that giving away their money
was essential to their wealth. And so should you. The secret
is that money multiplies fastest when it’s divided. It’s all
God’s money, in any case. We are merely temporary stew-
ards of a small portion of God’s abundance. And when this
portion is shared freely with those less fortunate, we prime
the economic pump of the universe.
I encourage you to establish a legacy that will outlive
you. Plant money trees from which others will harvest the
fruit. Ultimately, the only purpose for having wealth is to
help others less fortunate. Wealth shared is true wealth
indeed. The way I see it, God in His grace gave me the
undeserved talent to make money by simply sitting in front
of a computer and clicking a mouse every now and then.
As a result of that gift, we as a family have been able to
travel the world, build a large home, and enjoy some of the
finer things in life. The least I can do is give a healthy por-
tion of the fruits of that gift back to God’s work in the
world.

what is trend
trading?
T
REND trading is a form of trading that seeks to maxi-
mize trading profits and minimize risk by entering and exit-
ing strategic price chart setups. While the trend-trading
systems outlined here can be applied to any time frame—
from multimonth position trades to multiminute day
trades—most trend trades are held from 3 to 30 trading
days. It is called trend trading because it seeks to enter
already established trends (for the most part) and ride them
as they swing up or down to new highs or lows. But before
we further define what trend trading is, let’s first separate
the idea from what it is not.
WHAT TREND TRADING IS NOT
Trend Trading Is Not
Buy-and-Hold Investing
Buy-and-hold investing involves the fundamental or eco-
nomic analysis of market cycles, business sectors, and indi-
vidual companies with the intent ofbuying solid companies,
or funds of such companies, when valuations are attractive

94 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
or when growth prospects are strong, or, ideally, both. The
aim of this strategy is to realize long-term capital gains
with a minimum of portfolio turnover. Buy-and-hold
investors are not traders. They normally pay little atten-
tion to even the basics of technical analysis. A price chart
trend either up or down matters little to them. What mat-
ters instead is, in Warren Buffett’s terms, “buying a great
company at a fair price.” The holding time of a buy-and-
hold position is usually measured in years. In some cases
buy-and-hold investments can last a lifetime.
Trend Trading Is Not Position Trading
Position traders are indeed traders inasmuch as they nor-
mally rely on the technical analysis of price charts rather
than the fundamental analysis of companies. Rather than
positioning themselves within already established trends,
however, their aim is to get in on the beginning of new
trends, or even in anticipation of a trend prior to its begin-
ning. In other words, position traders like to buy bottoms
and sell tops, two things that trend traders are forbidden
to do except in a very limited sense (e.g., buying the bot-
tom of a dip to support in an established uptrend). Com-
pared to trend trading, position trading requires quite a bit
more patience. Position trades are normally measured in
months and can last a year or longer. The primary chart of
the position trader is the weekly chart, with the daily chart
being used to time entries and exits. If a position trade is
entered too soon, the trader is forced to sit through some-
times lengthy drawdowns.

==================================================

WHAT IS TREND TRADING? 95
Trend Trading Is Not Overnight Trading
The overnight trader is someone who relies on technical
analysis and tape-reading skills, along with (sometimes)
intraday news breaks, to take a quick two-day position in a
stock. The overnight trader normally enters the position
late in the trading day and sells before the close of the day
following. The overnight trader’s aim is to capture three
phases of movement: the afternoon run, the overnight gap,
and the next-day continuation. This is a very profitable
form of trading for someone with sound trading strategies
and a keen understanding of what prompts a stock’s
momentum, but it can be very time consuming, and trad-
ing the exit requires as much focused attention as day trad-
ing. While trend-trading skills can be used in overnight
trading, it is a multifaceted discipline and thus goes beyond
the normal range of trend trading.
Trend Trading Is Not Scalping
Scalping is a form of day trading inasmuch as positions are
held for only one trading day and all positions are exited
prior to or at the close of the trading day. As a day trader,
a scalper always goes home flat (completely in cash) at the
end of each trading session, with no open positions held
overnight. But scalping differs from ordinary day trading
(which can be a subspecies of trend trading) in that posi-
tions are normally held for only a few seconds, or at most
a few minutes. And while day traders usually rely on their
chart-reading skills, scalpers play only on the tape. They
isolate the stocks that are moving sharply that day—



==================================================
                     PAGE 115                     
==================================================

96 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
usually in response to unexpected news, an earnings
announcement, an upgrade or downgrade, or the like—and
scrutinize the tape (Level I and II quotes) for opportunis-
tic, quick-turn in-and-out trades. Scalpers put on lots of
trades each day, sometimes in the hundreds, with the aim
to make only a small profit on each (a scalp). These small
profits are leveraged into larger profits by increasing both
the volume of trades and the position size. Because scalpers
make little reference to price charts, they are technically
not trend traders.
WHAT TREND TRADING IS
In terms of time frame, trend trading occupies the range
of holding periods between the multimonth position trader
at the one extreme and the multisecond scalper at the other.
The primary aim of the trend trader is to capture the bulk
of major moves in trending stocks, entering after the trend
has begun and normally exiting before the trend concludes.
Trend traders use the price chart in a time frame that best
fits their intended holding period. If the trend-trading sys-
tem is applied to swing trading (see later discussion), for
example, then the trade will likely be held from 5 to 30
trading days. In swing trading, the daily chart is used pri-
marily. But the trend-trading systems outlined here can
also be used for day-trading purposes, in which case an
intraday chart like the five-minute period is most com-
monly used and the position held for only minutes or a few
hours at most.
Thus, it is important to think of trend trading as a set

of trading systems and not a trading style. Your particular
trading style (position trader, swing trader, day trader, etc.)
has to be determined by, among other things, your trading
objectives, the limits of your time, your temperament and
skills (e.g., unless you have quick reflexes, don’t even think
about scalping), and your income expectations. Further clar-
ification ofthe different types oftrading styles can be found
later in this chapter. (Note that only swing trading and day
trading, as defined here, are forms of trend trading.)

ADVANTAGES OF TREND TRADING
The advantages of trend trading over other forms of trad-
ing are numerous. Obviously, the anticipated returns tend
to be higher than what a buy-and-hold investor would
expect, even over what position traders expect, making
trend trading in either its longer-term (swing trading) or
shorter-term (day-trading) forms an ideal way to trade for
a living. If you do not hold a day job and have 8 to 10 hours
of free time each day—not to mention the inclination to
spend that time sitting in front of a computer screen click-
ing a mouse—then day trading may be the ideal way to
transform the trend-trading techniques outlined in this
book into a very profitable business. If you don’t have that
much spare time or would rather be doing other things
than squinting at pixels all day, then swing trading using
the trend-trading strategies we outline here may be the
ideal way to trade for a living.
Perhaps more important, trend trading does not
require the same level of expertise that sound buy-and-



==================================================

==================================================

100 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
holders need to turn a reasonable profit year after year. No
doubt about it, phenomenal wealth can be attained through
long-term investing—but it takes a lot of hard work, a lot
of time, and a bit of luck as well. One of the world’s wealth-
iest men, Warren Buffett, is the epitome of the intelligent,
successful long-term investor, buying sound companies at
steeply discounted prices. But Buffett works very hard at
what he does. He knows the businesses he buys inside and
out. He lunches with the company’s executives; he inter-
views middle management; he visits the company’s manu-
facturing plants and supply chains; he pores night and day
over oodles of bottom-line information—all before com-
mitting one dime of his hard-earned cash to a new invest-
ment. Even then, there is little guarantee of success. While
Buffett is truly an investing genius, his returns over the
past 10 years have averaged only a little over 6 percent
annually.
As a trend trader, do you have to work as hard as War-
ren Buffett? No! You simply take one of the systems taught
in these pages, go over a few charts each night, click the
mouse a few times in the morning, and you are all set to
make a decent living.
Moreover, buy-and-hold investors, and to a lesser
extent position traders, must have a great deal of patience.
They have to wait months, if not years, for the fruits of
their labor to become evident. Not so with trend trading.
This is what makes trend trading so ideal for those who
want to trade for a living. Stock market trends are fairly
short-lived phenomena. Up to 80 percent of the time,
stocks move sideways; they run in trends only about 20 per-



==================================================
                     PAGE 120

cent of the time. To follow trend-trading techniques is to
move in and out of stocks on a weekly (for swing traders)
or hourly (for day traders) basis. Thus, the payoff for your
efforts is more immediately seen.
This makes trend-trading techniques ideal for setting
up trading as a primary source of your income. If you apply
trend-trading systems to swing trading, say, your income
can be made available on a monthly basis due to the rela-
tively high turnover rate. This allows the trend trader to
trade two weeks for income to pay the monthly bills and
then two more weeks to compound the trading account.
With day trading, the income is available even more fre-
quently. What I do as manager of our Befriend the Trend
Fund is combine the two: swing trading for larger moves
with day trading to exploit intraday moves.
It needs to be said, of course, that like all forms of
trading, trend trading is susceptible to market fluctuations
and cycles. While you can trend-trade for a living, you
need to be very careful to set aside funds during the good
periods in order to have money available to pay the bills
during the lean periods. Like any form of trading or invest-
ing, there certainly will be lean periods.
Another advantage to trend trading is that when prop-
erly executed, trend-trading strategies of the type taught
here will yield much less risk than longer-term strategies.
Long-term investors are forced to ride bear markets into
the ground, anxiously watching their net worth slip away
as the indexes grind down day after day. But trend traders
have the freedom to simply exit losing trades quickly and
step aside. Or they can use one of the strategies outlined

here that are designed especially for bear markets to play
on the short side and thus make money while the investing
world suffers a drawdown.
Finally, to trend-trade well, you needn’t worry
about . . .
• Poring over financial statements like buy-and-hold
investors
• Catching precise market tops and bottoms like
position traders
• Seeing the bulk of your profits evaporate on
overnight gaps that go against you like overnight
traders
• Learning the sophisticated nuances of Level II
and other tape-reading devices like scalpers
In short, trend trading provides the greatest amount
of return for the least amount of work of any trading style.
So, let’s get started trend trading for a living!

setting up your
watch lists
T
HERE are over 10,000 listed and over-the-counter
stocks available for trading daily—and the list grows every
week. It is impossible to monitor the whole universe of
trading vehicles on a daily basis. So the logical thing to do,
and what trend traders must do before they do anything
else, is create and regularly update watch lists of stocks that
meet certain criteria. It is from these watch lists that we
will select most of the stocks we use for trend trading.
In order to create a watch list, we will need to screen
out those stocks that are unsuitable for trend trading.
Some charting services will offer special screening tools
for subscribers, but for our purposes the free stock screen-
ers offered by Yahoo! Finance are sufficient. Note that
Yahoo! Finance offers two free screening tools: a basic
service and a more advanced one. You should use the more
advanced tool, since the basic screener does not allow for
screening by volume. Fee-based screening can be found at
Stockcharts.com and at IQCharts; a subscription to either
service includes screening and scanning tools as part of the
package. I can also recommend the screening tool in
OmniTrader from Nirvana Systems. It runs very slowly

and thus is not suitable for frequent use, but it otherwise is
a very powerful resource.
YOUR PRIMARY WATCH LIST
I recommend setting up a list of possible trend-trading can-
didates by screening for the following three criteria: price,
average volume, and beta (a function of stock volatility rel-
ative to the broader market). There are usually lots of other
options available in screening packages—things such as
price/earnings ratios, quarterly growth trends, debt/equity
ratios, and often, too, a variety of technical variables. Just
ignore them for now. Subsequent chapters outline ways to
harness the full power of your screening tool to find great
trend-trading setups. To set up your primary watch lists all
you need are the three variables mentioned.
In screening for price, we want to weed out stocks that
are either too low in price (i.e., we want to avoid “penny
stocks”) or too high in price. In screening for volume, we
want to avoid thinly traded stocks. In screening for beta, we
want to eliminate slow-moving and nontrending stocks.
Specifically, I recommend screening per the following
settings:
• Price: between $10 and $100
• Average daily volume: greater than 500,000
• Beta: greater than 2.0 (at least twice as volatile as
the S&P 500)
This screen should return at least 50 stocks, and most
of the time it will yield well over that. But in certain mar-

==================================================

SETTING UP YOUR WATCH LISTS 105
ket conditions you may get less than 50 hits, in which case
it may be necessary to fiddle a bit with the numbers. In a
breakaway bull market of the kind we saw in the late 1990s,
for example, we may need to raise our maximum stock
price to capture the higher-priced big movers. In certain
markets you are forced to pay up for quality, and when it
comes to stocks, that is nearly always a wise thing to do.
Sometimes the market goes into a quiet period without
much movement, in which case we may not be able to find
many stocks trading at a 2.0 beta. In that case, the figure
may need to be lowered a bit.
Traders with smaller accounts may want to focus only
on lower-priced stocks. In this case, you can change the price
screen to something like $5 to $50, or whatever is most suit-
able. Traders with larger accounts and options traders who
are looking for daily multipoint swings may want to raise
the price range accordingly. At Befriendthetrend.com we
keep two separate watch lists to serve our two most popu-
lar newsletters: one designed for smaller account traders
(stocks priced $5 to $15) and one for larger account trad-
ers (stocks priced $15 and up). Keeping two separate lists
like this gives me a very interesting bit of market infor-
mation: I know we are in a bull market when I have too
many stocks showing up in the higher-priced screen and
too few in the lower-priced screen—and vice versa for
bear markets.
Regarding volume, it is important to note that we want
to screen for average daily volume, not single-day volume.
This avoids stocks that have a one-day high-volume event
but which on average are too thinly traded to suit our pur-
poses. It bears repeating that in no case should the average

volume figure be lowered below 500,000 daily shares. Liq-
uidity means stability, stability means lowered risk, and
lowered risk means greater profits in the long run; thus,
liquidity is an essential element in building a long-term
trading career.
Once this screen returns a list of stocks, sort the list by
order of decreasing beta. To make your primary watch list,
take the first 50 stocks on that list, that is, the top 50 stocks
ranked by order of decreasing beta. These are the stocks
you are going to monitor daily for trading setups. Don’t
select more than 50, because in certain market conditions
you will register too many setups to trade. Nor should you
limit your list to less than 50, because in nontrending mar-
kets you may not have any setups at all.
Once you have your list of 50 stocks, write these into
your charting software and save them as a focus list. As an
alternative, you can input the list into the Candleglance fea-
ture on Stockscharts.com. This feature gives you 10
thumbnail charts per Web page, and includes the 20- and
50-period moving averages and one technical indicator of
your choice on each chart. Figures 6.1 through 6.6 repre-
sent the six top high-beta, liquid stocks priced between $10
and $100 as screened on September 21, 2007 (note: my ini-
tial screen returned 247 stocks, which is typical of bull
markets like the one we are in now). I’ve added the CCI
indicator and set the charts at the two-month time period
(this also is variable). This is what Candleglance charts look
like once you have set them up.
Another site I like for keeping watch lists is Clear
station.com, which allows you to keep an infinite number
of lists for free. If you input your list of stocks into
Clearstation—to do this you will have to register with the

site—not only will you get thumbnail charts with moving
averages, stochastics, and MACD, you will also get daily
updates on which of your stocks have had upgrades or
downgrades, are expecting earnings, and have just trig-
gered certain technical buy and sell signals. An advantage
ofthe Clearstation watch lists is that you only need to book-
mark one page to access all your charts; with Stockcharts’
Candleglance feature you have to bookmark one page for
each 10 stocks on your list. A disadvantage is that Clearsta-
tion only offers bar charts, whereas Stockcharts uses the
more informative candlestick chart as its default.
I use both these services because each offers a slightly
different set of tools. I do prefer the watch list capacity at
Stockcharts to that of Clearstation, since, as a subscriber,
I have access to updates in real time (versus delayed time
for Clearstation). In truth, both are ideal for sorting
through dozens of stocks to find a shortlist of the charts
you want to do further research on.

Now, with your watch list of the 50 most liquid and most

After looking at their charts day after day, you will
begin to develop a feel for how these stocks trade. As you
train yourself in the trend-trading systems outlined in this
book, you will learn to recognize points of support and
resistance. You will be able to make notes of special trad-
ing opportunities as they set up on the charts (breakouts,
breakdowns, consolidations, movements toward or away
from major moving averages, etc.). You will be able to dis-
tinguish those that look like easy traders—that is, ones that
make smooth turns, rarely gap up or down, and have a
steady volume flow—from those that look more difficult.
The more difficult stocks to trade tend to have sloppy,
choppy price movements, wide overnight gaps, and huge
intraday ranges. These you should delete from your watch
list. You can replace them with stocks farther down the list
of your original screening. Remember, trading is a business
and these price charts are your employees. As a good boss,
you should keep close tabs on them: fire the unproductive
ones and replace them with more eager workers.
Your primary watch list will need to be updated once
a month. To do this, simply repeat the same process: screen
for price, volume, and beta; select the 50 highest beta
stocks; then input these into your charting software. As
you do your monthly updates you will find that the list does
not change all that much over time. The same great trad-
ing vehicles keep getting screened out from among the
masses. But in most market conditions you should be
replacing about half a dozen stocks at each new screening.
Keep track of these new additions, because you will now
need to become just as familiar with them as you were with
those they replaced. Also, whenever a company is bought

out or has a horrible news event, it is best to delete it from
your watch list. Large, multipoint gaps either up or down
tend to make for messy trading in the weeks and months
going forward.
In addition to this primary list of trading stocks, you
should add, on a daily basis, a few stocks that are screened
for special trading setups. These setups are described later.
You can add these stocks to those you have chosen from
your primary watch list, or you can do what I do: make sep-
arate watch lists for each special setup screen.
One last word on updating your watch lists: if you
choose to use Stockcharts.com for keeping your watch lists,
you have the advantage of moving the results of your
special setup screens directly into your watch lists with
a single click of the mouse. Since you will eventually be
screening for up to 10 setups—which means potentially
having 10 different watch lists in addition to your primary
list—this can prove to be a valuable timesaving option.

HEart of applying technical analysis to your watch lists
and then selecting which stocks to trade is a chart-specific
exercise. This is to say, your primary point of reference is
the stock’s price chart itself. All you need to know to make
profitable predictions about a stock’s future price move-
ment are the patterns of its past price movements as
recorded on the stock’s daily chart. This means that, with
the tools of technical analysis in your trading arsenal, you
do not need to:
• Watch every minute of CNBC or Bloomberg
Television
• Pore through hundreds of profit and loss
statements—boring!
• Track prior quarters for earnings and revenue
growth
• Worry about things like price/earnings ratios and
debt/equity ratios
• Monitor every news dispatch on Briefing.com or
Reuters
• Keep track of gross domestic product (GDP), the

consumer price index (CPI), the producer price
index (PPI), housing starts, and employment data
• Hang on every syllable of the latest Federal
Reserve announcement
• Anticipate mergers, buyouts, public offerings,
splits, FDA approvals, and so on
Instead, all you need to do to trend-trade profitably with
technical analysis is to check the chart, find trends, enter
them after they start, and exit them when they end.
Having said that, there is one further bit of analysis
beyond the stock’s price chart that you can do to add to the
likelihood that your trade will go in the intended direction.
It also involves applying technical analysis to a price chart,
but instead of the chart of the stock you intend to trade,
you will now be looking at the chart of the broader mar-
ket. If you can correlate your trade as much as possible with
the general market’s directionality and momentum, then
you will add significant percentage points to the probabil-
ity that your trade will turn out a winner.
In his best-selling book How to Make Money in Stocks,
William O’Neil includes market direction as an important
part of his CAN-SLIM trading strategy (it is the “M” in
SLIM). O’Neil’s strategy combines basic principles of fun-
damental analysis with an assessment of the price chart of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. O’Neil rightly concludes
that to give your trades every chance of success, whenever
possible you should avoid two fundamental mistakes: going
long in a bear market and buying into the top of a market
run.
But O’Neil overstates the case when he says, “If you



==================================================
                     PAGE 134                     
==================================================

DETERMINING GENERAL MARKET DIRECTION 115
are wrong about the direction of the broad general market,
three out of four of your stocks will slump with the mar-
ket averages and you will lose money” (O’Neil, p. 44). If
you follow the systems I outline here, you will be able to
make good money long in a bear market and short in a bull
market.
The key to trend-trading success in any type of mar-
ket is finding good charts. And there are always great charts
that shine brightly during bear markets, just as there are
many laggards that stink up the place during bull markets.
Again, any robust technical system must be chart-specific:
if directional movement is not happening in the daily chart
of the stock, it doesn’t matter what the general market is
doing, your stock position is not likely to move.
Still, it is important to have a general sense of what
type of market we are in: bull, bear, or range-bound. One
reason this is important is not because our success is depen-
dent on it, but because it makes our job a lot easier. It is
much easier to find good long setups in a bull market than
in a bear market. And you will have many more shorts to
choose from in a bear market than in a bull market. So
understanding the current market dynamic and playing it
accordingly is really an exercise in efficiency. More impor-
tant, perhaps, knowing and trading with the general mar-
ket direction can put a few percentage points of probability
on our side. Were we infallible chart readers, this would not
matter. But the fact that bull markets tend to cause more
stocks to go up than down, and bear markets cause more
stocks to go down than up, means that getting on the side
of the general market direction can help cover a multitude
of chart-reading sins.

GENERAL MARKET
Before we look more carefully at types of general markets,
let’s talk a bit about what we mean by the general market.
The truth is, there is nothing “general” about the stock
market. It is a collective of very specialized market niches,
each one of which has the capacity to sway the whole. Still,
we are able to get a day-by-day picture of the market’s con-
sensus by looking at the various stock indexes. For the pur-
poses of trend trading, we will need to look at only two
primary indexes: the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. To
make things as simple as possible, I like to use charts of the
exchange-traded fund (ETF) proxies for these indexes:
SPY for the S&P 500 and QQQQ for the Nasdaq 100. You
can also refer to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (whose
ETF is DIA). It is a much-revered benchmark, and it does
represent the country’s 30 largest companies working the
world’s most productive industries. But it so closely shad-
ows the S&P 500 that it needn’t be a requisite part of our
general market analysis.
More experienced traders can also add special market
cap indexes and sector indexes to their analysis. If you want
to do that, let me suggest that you also add the following
charts to your general market watch list (again, put these
in your Stockcharts.com or Clearstation.com watch lists
for added convenience):
General Markets
• SPY (S&P 500)—tracks the 500 largest publicly
traded companies

• QQQQ (Nasdaq 100)—tracks the 100 largest

• MDY (S&P Midcaps)—tracks 400 representative
midcap companies
• IWM (Russell 2000)—tracks 2,000 representative
small-cap companies
Sector Indexes
• SMH—semiconductor companies
• IBB—biotech companies
• OIH—oil services companies
• HHH—Internet companies
• RTH—retail companies
• XLF—financial services companies
• XHB—home building companies
This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but it is a
good start. These ETFs also make great trading vehicles,
by the way. At Befriendthetrend.com, we offer The Index
Newsletter, which trades these and other ETFs exclusively,
including the brand-new ultra funds, which move in sync
with the broader indexes but are leveraged at 2:1. I use sev-
eral. Many subscribers use this letter to determine their
sense of general market direction as well as profit from the
trend-trade picks listed there. But if you would rather
determine general market direction on your own, we give
you here the rules for doing so.

going to use SPY and QQQQ as your primary indicators
of general market direction. Over the course of several
years of watching and trading these broader indexes, we
have come to note five different types of market conditions.
They are:
• Bullish strongly trending
• Bullish weakly trending
• Bearish strongly trending
• Bearish weakly trending
• Range-bound (or nontrending)
In general, we want to focus on long plays in the first two
types of market, short plays in the next two types, and a
mix of longs and shorts in the last type of market. Let’s first
define the parameters of these different market types.
BULLISH: STRONGLY TRENDING
The Focus It should be on long setups, particularly
breakout plays (to be explained later).
Characteristics This is everyone’s favorite kind of
market—except, of course, those “permabears” who always
think the U.S. economy is going to collapse at any moment.
This is the sort of market that sparked the day-trading
frenzy in the late 1990s: everything goes up, and up a lot,
nearly every day. The bulls are completely in control and
win every battle with the bears. Making money is easy in
a bullish strongly trending market, as long as you have the
right entry system. But the drawback is that when this kind



==================================================
                     PAGE 138                     
==================================================

DETERMINING GENERAL MARKET DIRECTION 119
of market reaches a top, the sell-off can be quick and harsh
and can wipe out months of hard-won gains in a matter
of days. So in a strong bull market you must always be
careful to play defensively against a possible reversal of
momentum.
What to Look For Bullish strongly trending markets are
easy to spot. Here are the key indicators:
• The 20 MA is above the 50 MA.
• Both the 20 MA and the 50 MA are rising.
• The distance between the 20 MA and the 50 MA
is large and/or getting larger.
• Pullbacks in price reach only to the 20 MA, or at
the most between the 20 MA and 50 MA; they do
not reach all the way to the 50 MA.
How to Play It Use one of our systems as outlined later.
Here we can say that a bullish strongly trending market is
a great market to be in if you are already long. But if you
are coming late to the party (and hopefully not too late),
your best play is to look for stocks that are breaking out to
new highs from periods of consolidation. You must make
sure these breakout plays are confirmed by the various
technical indicators we use. If price is making a new high
but the indicators are not making new highs, then you have
bearish divergence and you should move on to another
chart.
Chart Example The chart of SPY in Figure 7.1 shows a
classic bullish strongly trending market. Note that the 20



==================================================
                     PAGE 139                     
==================================================

Figure 7.1 SPY—bullish: strongly trending.
MA (dotted line) is above the 50 MA (solid line), and that
both MAs are in a rising uptrend. Further, the 20 MA is
quite far away from the 50 MA, and the distance between
is getting larger rather than smaller. Finally, note that the
mid-August pullback and the two pullbacks in September
traveled only as far as the 20 MA before the trend upward
resumed again.
BULLISH: WEAKLY TRENDING
The Focus It should be on long setups, particularly pull-
back plays (to be explained later).
Characteristics This is a tougher market to trade, since
the pullbacks tend to be more frequent, steeper, and
longer-lived. In a weakly trending market, corrections can
last a couple of weeks. This can be frustrating if you are



==================================================
                     PAGE 140

sitting on open long positions. Ultimately, the bulls are in
control, but it can seem for days on end that the bears have
moved in and made themselves right at home. However,
this is one of the best markets in which to find great
risk/reward scenarios in our setups. Those lengthier pull-
backs serve to take a lot of the risk out of a trade, so our
stop-loss can be closer to entry, and our exit targets can be
that much further away.
What to Look For Bullish weakly trending markets are
not quite as obvious as their strong counterparts, but with
some experience you should be able to recognize them.
Here are the key indicators:
• The 20 MA is mostly (though not always) above
the 50 MA.
• The 50 MA is rising, but the 20 MA is fluctuating
(though mostly rising).
• The distance between the 20 MA and the 50 MA
changes frequently.
• Pullbacks reach all the way to the 50 MA
(sometimes beyond but only briefly).
How to Play It Use one of our systems outlined later.
Here we can say that a bullish weakly trending market is an
ideal market for trend trading. You should find stocks that
are showing strong trending action (normally stronger than
the general market itself) but have pulled back to an area
of support. This pullback should be confirmed by oversold
indicators, and the current daily candlestick should put in
a reversal bar of some kind before you consider an entry.

Figure 7.2 SPY—bullish: weakly trending.
Chart Example The chart of SPY in Figure 7.2 shows a
classic bullish weakly trending market. Note that the 20
MA remains above the 50 MA, and that the 50 MA is
clearly in a rising uptrend. But also note that there are fluc-
tuations in the 20 MA, indicating that sell-offs in the index
are quite sharp and deep. You should also note that the var-
ious pullbacks seen in every month of this chart period
traveled as far as the 50 MA, and sometimes beyond, before
the trend upward resumed.
BEARISH: STRONGLY TRENDING
The Focus It should be on short setups, particularly
breakdown plays (to be explained later).
Characteristics This is perhaps the most difficult mar-
ket to trade. There are two reasons for this. First, bear
markets always fight the long-term trend of the stock mar-



==================================================
                     PAGE 142                     
==================================================

DETERMINING GENERAL MARKET DIRECTION 123
ket (which is up) and, as such, tend to be short-lived. The
second reason has to do with the extremely volatile nature
of short-covering. Strong downtrends can cause a market
to get so oversold so quickly that automated buy programs
kick in to scoop up cheap shares. This causes traders and
fund managers to cover their short positions in order to
lock in profits. As they do so, they are forced to buy back
shares they have borrowed, and the result is a sharp and
quick short-covering rally (what traders call a dead cat
bounce). But the advantage of bearish strongly trending
markets is that they tend to go down faster than bullish
strongly trending markets go up. When the bears are in
control of a market, as they are in this type of market, they
tend to go wild and overdo things. Can you blame them?
For over 200 years, they have had to play second fiddle to
the flashier bulls, and finally this is their chance in the spot-
light. But you can take advantage of this. If you are willing
to play the short side—to trend-trade for a living you must
be willing to short—you can potentially make a lot more
money in less time in a bearish strongly trending market
than in any other type of market. And it is always a thrill
to make money while 90 percent of the investing world is
losing theirs.
What to Look For A bearish strongly trending market
is as easy to spot as its bullish cousin. Here are the key indi-
cators:
• The 20 MA is below the 50 MA.
• Both the 20 MA and the 50 MA are falling.
• The distance between the 20 MA and the 50 MA
is large and/or getting larger.

==================================================

124 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• Rallies reach only to the 20 MA or, at the most
between the 20 MA and the 50 MA.
How to Play It Use one of our systems outlined later.
Here we can say that a bearish strongly trending market is
a great market to be in if you are already short. But if you
are coming late to the party (and hopefully not too late),
your best play is to look for stocks that are breaking down
to new lows from periods of consolidation. You must make
sure these breakdown plays are confirmed by the various
technical indicators we use. Ifprice is making a new low, but
the indicators are not making new lows, then you have bull-
ish divergence and you should move on to another chart.

classic bearish strongly trending market. Note that once the
bear market begins in earnest in late April, the 20 MA

crosses below the 50 MA and remains there throughout the
period. Also note that both MAs are falling, and that the
20 MA is falling at a faster pace than the 50 MA. You
should also note that the various rallies seen in this chart,
once the strong trend is established, travel only as far as the
20 MA before the dominant trend downward resumes.
As a follow-up, keep in mind our previous warning:
bearish strongly trending markets can end very abruptly if
a short-covering frenzy sets in. Check out what happened
just two weeks after SPY tested the 20 MA in a bearish
strongly trending market: instead of resuming the domi-
nant trend, it reversed and killed it.
BEARISH: WEAKLY TRENDING
The Focus It should be on short setups, particularly ral-
lies into resistance (to be explained later).

==================================================

126 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
Characteristics This is an easier bear market to trade
than the strongly trending version, since the rallies into
resistance that trigger our setups take a lot of the risk out
of the trade. But it still suffers from the two problems asso-
ciated with bear markets we mentioned previously. In a
weakly trending market, corrections (rallies) can last a cou-
ple of weeks, which can be frustrating if you are sitting on
open short positions. Ultimately, the bears are in control,
but it can seem for days on end that the bulls have moved
in and made themselves right at home. However, just like
its bullish cousin, this is one of the best markets in which
to find great risk/reward setups. Those lengthier correc-
tions to the dominant trend serve to take a lot of the risk
out of a trade, so our stop-loss can be closer to entry, and
our exit targets can be that much farther away.
What to Look For Bearish weakly trending markets are
also easy to spot. Here are the key indicators:
• The 20 MA is mostly (though not always) below
the 50 MA.
• The 50 MA is falling, but the 20 MA is
fluctuating (though mostly falling).
• The distance between the 20 MA and the 50 MA
changes frequently.
• Rallies reach all the way to the 50 MA
(sometimes beyond but only briefly).

DETERMINING GENERAL MARKET DIRECTION 127
a good market for trend trading. You should find stocks
that are showing strong downwardly trending action (nor-
mally stronger than the general market itself) but have ral-
lied up into an area of resistance. This rally should be
confirmed by overbought indicators. The daily candlestick
should put in a reversal bar of some kind before you con-
sider an entry.
Chart The chart of SPY in Figure 7.5 shows a classic
bearish weakly trending market. Note that the 20 MA
remains for the most part below the 50 MA. There is a
period in February where the 20 MA rises above the 50
MA—a sign that the index might be moving into a range-
bound condition. But then the trend resumes with another
bearish crossover. Note that the 50 MA is clearly in a falling
trend throughout the period. Also note that there are fluc-

tuations in the 20 MA, indicating that the rallies in the
index are quite sharp and prolonged. These various rallies
traveled as far as the 50 MA, and sometimes beyond, before
the trend downward resumed again.
RANGE-BOUND (NONTRENDING)
The Focus It should be on both long and short setups,
particularly trendline breakout/breakdown plays (to be
explained later).
Characteristics Range-bound markets are the bane of a
buy-and-holder’s existence, but for the technical trader they
are a godsend. This is because the technical indicators we
use (stochastics, CCI, RSI) register overbought and over-
sold signals that work most robustly in range-bound mar-
kets. Moreover, if you are willing to trade more frequently,
you can make a lot of money in a range-bound market. It
is essential therefore to learn how to identify range-bound
markets, because the general market spends a majority of
its time in such a condition. In a range-bound market, price
bounces up and down between roughly parallel pivot points
of support (on the low side) and resistance (on the high
side). Such a market suggests that bulls and bears are wag-
ing a war with each other, but no one side is clearly win-
ning. Trading ranges between parallel pivot points can be
either wide or narrow, and it is a general rule that the wider
the trading range, the longer price stays within it. Nar-
rower ranges tend to be broken to the upside or downside
more easily.

                     PAGE 148                     
==================================================

DETERMINING GENERAL MARKET DIRECTION 129
What to Look For Range-bound markets are not always
easy to spot, but there are rules to follow. Here are the key
indicators:
• The 20 MA spends about as much time above as
below the 50 MA.
• The 50 MA is mostly flat, while the 20 MA varies
from rising to falling.
• The distance between the 20 MA and the 50 MA
varies greatly.
• Rallies and sell-offs easily pass through both
moving averages.
How to Play It Use one of our systems outlined later.
Here it can be said that it is frustrating for traders when a
range-bound market first appears, especially when it follows
a strong up- or downtrend. Traders can be reluctant to tran-
sition from a fast-money, momentum environment (strong
trend) to the more strategic, labor-intensive environment
of the range-bound condition. But once the trading range
is established, it can be an ideal trading environment. In a
trading range, we use trendlines to highlight and delimit the
minitrends within the range and our technical indicators to
spot oversold and overbought levels as well as bullish and
bearish divergence. We are looking to play reversals right
off the pivot points of support and resistance, confirmed by
a break of the intrarange trendline. Indicator divergence is
often a key to locating the best reversal trades and will often
let us pinpoint with extreme accuracy the tops and bottoms
of movements within the range.

Chart The chart of SPY in Figure 7.6 shows a rather
wide trading range or range-bound condition. Note that
the 50 MA remains relatively flat throughout this period,
while the 20 MA bounces up and down following price.
Also note that price does not pause much at either moving
average but for the most part continues up and down as if
they were not even there (in trending markets the MAs
tend to act as support and resistance). That snake-ish look
to the 20 MA, up and down like a roller coaster, is a tell-
tale sign that we are in a range-bound market.
Once you understand the type of market you are cur-
rently trading in, you will have a better sense of the type
of trade to look for: long or short, breakout or breakdown,
pullback to support or rally into resistance, and so on. As
indicated at the beginning of this section, this piece of your
trading strategy is far from being the most important. The

vital key to your success as a trend trader is finding the
best-looking chart, regardless of what the rest of the mar-
ket is doing. But if you can consistently get yourself on the
same side as the market’s net money flow, you will give your
trading an extra edge. Sometimes that can make the differ-
ence between long-term success and a short-term wipeout.

Nthe following pages I am going to display a number of
charts from the ETF proxies that represent the three pri-
mary stock averages: SPY (S&P 500), DIA (Dow Jones
Industrial Average), and QQQQ (Nasdaq 100). Take a
piece of paper and jot down what market type you think
each chart displays. It might be helpful first to review the
rules for each of the market types.
Bullish: Strongly Trending
• The 20 MA is above the 50 MA.
• Both the 20 MA and the 50 MA are rising.
• The distance between the 20 MA and the 50 MA
is large and/or getting larger.
• Pullbacks reach only to the 20 MA or, at the
most, between the 20 MA and 50 MA.
Bullish: Weakly Trending
• The 20 MA is mostly (though not always) above
the 50 MA.
• The 50 MA is rising, but the 20 MA is fluctuating
(though mostly rising).

between one type and another. To answer correctly in these
cases you will need to identify both market types on either
side of the transition. There may be a few charts that
clearly show more than two types of market. So think care-
fully about your answers. Review the rules and stay
focused!

Remember, these answers and their supportive com-
mentary are the products of my own subjective readings of
the charts based on many years of active trading experi-
ence. As mentioned, chart reading is not an exact science.
Subjectivity is involved no matter how many rules are
applied. Nevertheless, a conscientious application of the
rules we laid out should keep us more or less on track. In
trading we are not looking for exactitude. Precision is not
an available commodity on the trading floor. All that is
needed to be hugely profitable in the trading game is to be
right more often than wrong.
Here are the answers as I see them (feel free to argue,
but you better have some good reasons for doing so!). Give
yourself points for every market type you get right:



==================================================
                     PAGE 165                     
==================================================

1. This is clearly a bullish strong trending market, no
questions asked. [1 point]
2. This one is a bit harder to decipher. The left side of
the chart shows a straightfoward bullish strong trend.
Then things get fuzzier. The market goes into a
tight consolidation that could be called range-bound,
but because there is not much snake-ish action from
the 20 MA it is really more a period of transition.
From there we have two possibilities. Either the
market goes into a short-lived bullish strong trend,
followed quickly by a bearish strong trend, or the
market transitioned into the initial phase of a wide
range-bound condition. More time is needed to
confirm which possibility is correct. Give yourself
credit if you gave either answer (in fact, the market
went into a wide trading range in late 1998).
[2 points]
3. Here we see a range-bound market. While the
general trend is modestly upward, we see enough
variation in the 50 MA to hesitate in calling it
trending. The 50 MA is the key to the trending
market: it should show no hesitation in moving up
or down (a bit of flatness is okay, but it should never
move countertrend). Certainly the 20 MA is
“snakey” enough to allow us to get in some
trendline breakout and breakdown plays. [1 point]
4. Clearly a bullish strong trend. What a beauty of a
chart! [1 point]
5. Another range-bound market. Note the up and down
twists of the 20 MA. [1 point]

6. Another clear bullish strong trend. It took a bit for
this one to get started, but when price pulled back
on September 11 to touch the 20 MA, then pushed
off again, we got the confirmation that this was
indeed a market with the bulls in control. [1 point]
7. Again, a range-bound market, as shown by the 50
MA, which just refuses to confirm an uptrend.
Things did get strongly bullish in late September
for a week or so, but once price pulled back and
closed below the 50 MA, that possibility was
negated. [1 point]
8. Range-bound, very clear. Look at that 20 MA: snake-
city! [1 point]
9. There is a lot going on in this chart. Here we have
five distinct market types: how many did you name?
Clearly, on the left side of the chart we are in range-
bound territory. That is easy enough. But then a
sharp drop in the index in July and August tempts
us to say we are in a bearish strong trend. This gets
confirmed when price kisses the 20 MA on a relief
rally and then plunges lower and the 50 MA shows a
downward slope. So that’s the second market type.
But the trend gets negated pretty quickly once price
shoots up above the 50 MA in early September. At
this point we would have to say we are back to a
range-bound market, only the range is now wider.
But then the index keeps going up, and the first
pullback in late September bounces cleanly off the
50 MA without going through it. This gives us
our fourth market type: a bullish weak trend. We
hold to this view until mid-October, when some



==================================================
                     PAGE 167                     
==================================================

148 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
consolidation brings the index down to the 20 MA
area. Here it holds before pushing strongly higher.
The fact that it never went all the way to the 50 MA
means that now, on the right side of the chart, we
are in a bullish strong trend. This clearly gets
confirmed as the index continues to climb higher,
and the 20 MA moves further and further away
from a rising 50 MA. Give yourself one point for
each market type you recognized (in the right
order). [5 points]
10. Range-bound. No questions asked. [1 point]
11. Bearish strong trend. No doubt about it. [1 point]
12. This chart is a bit more interesting. It starts with an
obvious bullish weak trend. Note the frequent
pullbacks to the 50 MA, which is in a consistent
uptrend. But then the chart morphs into a range-
bound condition as it consolidates all that upward
movement and the 50 flattens out. By mid-July we
might be tempted to call the early part of that
transition a bearish weak trend, since the 50 MA area
came close to holding as resistance and it is starting
to roll over to the downside. But the fact that on its
second relief rally later that month the index was
easily able to pass through the 50 MA leads us to
confirm that we are still within a trading range
rather than starting a new trend. [2 points]
13. We see a range-bound initially, then the chart falls
off quickly into a bearish strong trend as that tight
range breaks to the downside. The trading range



==================================================

==================================================

PUT YOUR MARKET-READING SKILLS TO THE TEST 149
seen here is very tight, and as such it is one of the
worst kinds of market environments to trade in.
Range-bound conditions are great for trend
trading, as long as the range is wide enough to
permit both longs and shorts sufficient time to
bring our trailing stop-losses into profit territory.
But the kind of tight range seen here is next to
impossible to profit from unless you are a day
trader. When we are in a tight range-bound
market, we therefore need to find charts on our
watch list that are not range-bound but which
are showing sizeable moves either up or down.
[2 points]
14. This chart starts with a bullish weak trend that then
morphs into a bullish strong trend. Either way, it is a
nice market for longs. [2 points]
15. A bullish weak trend is clearly seen here. [1 point]
16. Here we have a bearish strong trend that then
reverses sharply and becomes a bullish strong trend.
The fulcrum on which this strong reversal pivots is,
of course, the terrorist attacks on the United States
that took place on September 11, 2001. You can see
clearly the gap down that took place after the
markets reopened (they were closed for four days
after the attacks) and subsequent selling pressure
that led the index to make a deep cut low. From
there, the index rallied over 50 percent in a few
short weeks. We were able to position ourselves for
this ramp-up, by the way—even before the strong

trend was confirmed—by looking at bullish
divergence in the indicators. [2 points]
17. A bullish strong trend, which then consolidates in a
range-bound condition. [2 points]
18. A bullish strong trend that then flattens out and
morphs into a bullish weak trend. Note the transition
that takes place between the two markets. In July
we see some price consolidation after the sharp
upward ramp. The 20 MA begins to flatten out, and
the index moves all the way into the 50 MA, even
slightly beyond. But once the 50 MA held as
support and the index rallied, we knew we were still
in an uptrend; only now it would not likely be as
strong as it had been in prior weeks. Again, strong
trends play off the 20 MA, weak trends off the 50
MA. [2 points]
19. A bearish weak trend is clearly seen here. Note that
this trend got a big kick start with a gap down in
January. Also note how the 50 MA acts as resistance
all the way through. [1 point]
20. Easy enough: a range-bound market (due to the fact
that price moves so easily through the 50 MA) that
by mid-August, with the first successful hold of the
50 MA as support, becomes a bullish weak trend.

the assessments listed here.
Here is how you should score yourself:

I would suggest rereading this chapter and spending
some time looking at more charts before moving on.

I
N this section, I am going to introduce you to my top
10 technical setups. These are the setups we at Befriend
thetrend.com have found over the years to be the best pos-
sible setups for trend trading. Each of these setups is pro-
prietary. This doesn’t mean that we have a copyright to
them, or that they use any secret “black box” formula that
we will reveal to you only at our really, really expensive
seminars. Rather, it simply means that they have been
uniquely designed by me (“Dr. Stoxx”) and the Befriend
thetrend.com team through long periods of rigorous back-
testing and real-money trading. These are the setups we
use daily to find the trades we recommend to our various
newsletter subscribers, and that we also trade with real
money in our Befriend the Trend Fund. While they use
common technical elements—so common that any popu-
lar charting system can accommodate them—there is noth-
ing common about their performance.
A setuphere refers to a combination of price pattern—
the way price paints a certain picture on the chart—and
technical indicators that, together, give us the right condi-

tions for predicting with reasonable confidence the future
direction of a stock’s price. Now just because you have a
great-looking setup on a chart does not in any way guar-
antee that price will move in our predicted direction. But
the following setups have been selected because they have,
in the past, contributed to a healthy percentage of highly
profitable trades. They are thus high-probability setups.
For each of these setups we are going to tell you sev-
eral things. We will indicate which market type, of the
types we studied in Chapter 8, each setup is best suited for.
This doesn’t mean that there is only one market type you
should play the setup in—it only means that the market
type indicated will give your trade the best possible edge.
We will also give you the rules you need to identify the
setup on your watch list (see Chapter 6 on setting up a
watch list), including the rules needed to confirm your
entry into the trade. We will also show you how to use a
stock-screening tool to search for these setups. You will
have to resort to this tool whenever your watch list fails to
produce any examples of that particular setup. We will tell
you in very specific terms exactly how and when to enter
the setup as you initiate a new stock position. For each
setup we will give you two or three charts to examine that
illustrate what each of the setups looks like in live trading.
For the sake of convenience we have put our five bull-
ish setups in this chapter and our five bearish setups in
Chapter 10. In Chapter 11, we will be treating the all-
important topic of how to properly enter and exit your
positions in order to maximize your profits and minimize
your risks.

nese candlestick terms, please go to one of the several free
Web-based tutorials on the subject. Three that I can rec-
ommend are supplied by these Web sites:
• www.altavest.com
• www.stockcharts.com
• www.incrediblecharts.com
Candlestick formations factor quite prominently in
several of our systems, so be sure that before you continue
you are familiar with their basic terminology. There are
dozens of candlestick formations that you could study, but
I focus only on the following high-percentage formations:
• Doji
• Hammer
• Piercing
• Morning/evening star
• Engulfing
Once you have had your candlestick tutorial, you are
ready to begin looking for our top 10 setups. We have
divided these into two general types: five bullish setups and
five bearish setups. If you are looking for trades on the long
side, with the expectation that price will rise for several
days after entry, then you will be looking for one of our
bullish setups. If you are looking for trades on the short
side, with the expectation that price will fall for several days
after entry, then you will be looking for one of our bear-
ish setups.

setups, and sometimes none at all. In other market condi-
tions, you will find dozens of tradable setups. It is best
always to maintain the mindset that you will take whatever
the markets give you. Following are the top five bullish
setups.
THE PULLBACK
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bullish: strongly trending markets
• Bullish: weakly trending markets
Characteristics This is one of my all-time favorite
setups. Its origins lie in a seminar I took back in 1996
under the tutelage of a now discredited stock market guru.
If we can bracket out the fact that the man was convicted
by the SEC of making fraudulent claims on his Web site,
it is fair to say that he put on a very helpful seminar back
then, at a very reasonable price. The essential tools I
learned there form the basis for this bullish setup. Its focus
is on uptrending stocks that have experienced a period of
minor weakness. This weakness may just be a spate of
profit taking, or it may be in response to news or an earn-
ings announcement. Regardless, our assumption is that the
weakness is temporary and thus a buying opportunity.
Normally after a period of minor weakness—as measured
here by the stochastics indicator reaching an oversold
level—the dominant uptrend will reassert itself as traders
who missed out on the prior move use the dip to get on
board.



==================================================
                     PAGE 178                     
==================================================

SELECTING BULLISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 159
Key Indicators In the pullback setup, there are three key
indicators:
• First, you should identify an uptrending stock (see
definition) that has pulled back either into an
upsloping 20 MA, between the 20 MA and the 50
MA, or all the way to the 50 MA. If this pullback
point coincides with, or lies near, an upsloping
trendline drawn under the lows of the uptrend, so
much the better.
Definition: An uptrending stock is a stock that is
making higher lows (and preferably higher highs,
but, strictly speaking, this is not necessary) over
at least the past three months. A weakly uptrend-
ing stock is an uptrending stock whose 20 MA is
mostly rising and mostly above a consistently ris-
ing 50 MA. A strongly uptrending stock is an
uptrending stock whose 20 MA is always rising
and always above a consistently rising 50 MA.
The further these two moving averages are from
each other, the stronger the uptrend.
• Second, along with the price pullback there must
be a sharp dip in the stochastics indicator (5,3
period) to or below the oversold 20 line. This
confirms that the stock is in an oversold
condition.
• Third, the current candlestick must register a
bullish reversal candle of some kind (hammer,
engulfing, piercing, or doji). If the current



==================================================
                     PAGE 179                     
==================================================

160 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
candlestick shows a bearish candle, or a red or
black candle of any kind (close lower than the
open), then this is a wait-and-see condition. You
should make a note to check that stock again the
next trading day.
• Buy signal: These three factors register a buy
signal, and the stock is ready to be short-listed
as a valid pullback play.
The Screening Tool The pullback setup occurs most
often in bullish weakly trending markets that have suffered
a short period of price consolidation or profit taking. They
can also occur in strongly uptrending markets in volatile
stocks that tend to pull back further than the general mar-
ket. There are occasions in the natural course of market
cycles when pullback setups do not appear very often. Ifyou
fail to find any decent pullbacks on your primary watch list,
you can try using a special screen to search the universe of
stocks for them. To screen for pullback plays, input the fol-
lowing criteria into Stockcharts.com’s screening tool:
• For the last market close:
• All stocks with . . .
• 60-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 15.
• The chart has a bullish engulfing pattern for to-
day (you can also run this with piercing, ham-
mer, or doji selected as well).
• 20-day simple moving average of close for today



==================================================
                     PAGE 180                     
==================================================

SELECTING BULLISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 161
is greater than 50-day simple moving average of
close for today.
• Daily close for today is less than daily close for
five days ago times 1.15.
This will normally give you a list of between two and
twenty stocks, depending on market conditions. If the list
is large, I will increase the 60-day moving average of vol-
ume to 1,000,000 and the daily close five days ago multi-
plier to 1.20. If the list is too small, I will decrease the
multiplier to 1.10 or less. It is not wise to go any lower than
500,000 on the moving average of volume.
If that scan fails to produce any viable pullback can-
didates, you can try this alternate scan:
• For the last market close:
• U.S. stocks with . . .
• 20-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 1,000,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 5.
• 20-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 50-day simple moving average of
close for today.
• 50-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 200-day simple moving average
of close for today.
• 50-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 50-day simple moving average of
close for 10 days ago.
• 200-day simple moving average of close for to-

day is greater than 200-day simple moving aver-
age of close for 20 days ago.
• Daily close for today is less than daily close for

• Daily close for 7 days ago is greater than daily

• Daily close for today is less than or equal to 20-

Figure 9.1 is an example of a strongly uptrending
stock, BRCM, which gave two pullback buy signals. Note
that the stock is easily seen to be uptrending, and indeed is
in a strong uptrend, with the rising 20 MA well above a ris-
ing 50 MA. We can see that on two occasions the stock
pulled back to the 20 MA area and then put in a bullish
candle: in the first signal there is a bullish engulfing can-
dle, and in the second instance a doji. At both signals the
stochastics dropped down to or below 20, signaling an
oversold condition ripe for a reversal.
Figure 9.2 is another example of a strongly uptrend-
ing stock, QCOM, which gave one wait-and-see signal
(first arrow) and two pullback buy signals. Note that the
first of the two buy signals (second arrow) occurred in a

strong uptrend but nevertheless got us in a bit prematurely,
but a well-placed stop-loss (see Chapter 11) would have
kept us in the trade. With a little patience, the trade even-
tually turned profitable. The second buy signal occurred
during a weaker moment in the uptrend but still yielded a
solid profit opportunity.
THE COILED SPRING
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bullish: strongly trending markets
• Bullish: weakly trending markets
• Range-bound markets
Characteristics This is sometimes known as a bull flag
or bull pennantsetup and sometimes as a symmetrical trian-
gle pattern, depending on the shape of the coiled spring.
For our purposes, we will lump all these together under a
single setup. The premise of the coiled spring is that after
a strong runup, a strong stock likes to take a breather as it
consolidates the ramp-up in price. A weak stock will sell
off, giving back much of its gains. But a strong stock likes
to coil up in a sideways movement. As it does so, price tends
to trend inside an ever tighter range—the spring coils up
tighter and tighter—until shares are ready to climb again.
When the coil finally springs open, it usually does so with
a delightfully profitable burst of upward momentum.
Key Indicators The pattern relies on a precise definition
of what we mean by coiled spring. Here are the parameters:

==================================================

SELECTING BULLISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 165
• In the coiled spring setup, you are looking for a
weakly uptrending to strongly uptrending stock
(see previous setup for definition) that has
recently put in a new high. By recently we mean
within the past 20 trading days. This new high
must be at least a new three-month high.
• Since setting that new high, the stock has
consolidated inside a coiled spring (see definition).
The coiled spring can be short and tight or drawn
out and choppy, but the pattern requires the coil
to be tightening up (the trading range is getting
smaller) as it moves further to the right.
Definition: The coiled spring gets its name from
the narrowing range the stock trades in over the
last seven to twenty trading days as shares con-
solidate at or near its new high. This range can
trade sideways or it can downtrend slightly, but it
should not be trading at an upward angle. The
key to the pattern is that the trading range, in
general, is getting tighter and tighter.
• Note that in this setup we pay no attention to
indicators. This is a pure pattern play. All we
need are the two moving averages, the 20 MA
and the 50 MA, and some trendlines.
• Use the moving averages to determine that the
stock is weakly or strongly uptrending (see pre-
ceding definition).
• Draw in trendlines over the top and bottom of
the coiled spring. It should form a triangular



==================================================

==================================================

166 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
shape of some kind due to the narrowing trad-
ing range of the coil but should not be angled
upward.
• It is essential that the coiled spring last at least
seven but no more than 20 trading days. It is also
essential that no part of the coil extend to or
beyond the 50 MA. It can pass over the 20 MA,
but not the 50 MA.
• Buy signal: The coiled spring itself puts the stock
on the shortlist. A break of the trendline drawn
over the tops of this coil marks the buy signal. A
close below the lower trendline negates the coiled
spring, and so we delete it from our watch list.
The Screening Tool The coiled spring setup is not
often seen among high-beta or volatile stocks, so it will not
show up much on your primary watch list. But you can
screen for such stocks by inputting the following parame-
ters into Stockcharts.com’s screener:
• For the last market close:
• All stocks with . . .
• 60-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 10.
• Daily close for today is greater than or equal to
daily open for today.
• Daily high for today is less than or equal to
daily high for five days ago.

• Daily low for today is greater than or equal to
daily low for five days ago.
• 20-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 50-day simple moving average of
close for today times 1.08.
Here is an alternate screen that also can turn up some
nice coiled spring setups:
• For the last market close:
• All stocks with . . .
• 60-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 10.
• 50-day simple moving average of close for today
is less than 20-day simple moving average of
close for today.
• Daily Average Directional Index (ADX) line
(14) for today is less than daily ADX line (14)
for 20 days ago times 0.41.
In a market moving mostly sideways, you may return
10 to 15 stocks per day with these screens. But in most
market conditions, your list will be a short one, and not all
the stocks that turn up on this screen are really coiled
springs. Give each chart that turns up on the screen a good
eyeballing, and use the aforelisted rules to eliminate all but
the most coiled of springs.
One thing to watch out for is that the trading range

                     PAGE 187                     
==================================================

168 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
within the coil is generally getting smaller (less intraday
movement). The intraday lows should be getting a bit
higher, and/or the highs a bit lower. You can have a wide
range bar or two in this range, but that should be the
exception, not the rule. Generally speaking, the longer the
coiled spring is strung out, the higher it will rise after
the spring has sprung. But coiled springs longer than 20
days in duration tend to indicate indecision on the part of
investors and are best avoided.
Figure 9.3 is an example of a stock, ALVR, showing a
coiled spring setup that triggered a successful buy signal
once price broke above the trendline drawn over the tops
of the coil. Note that the coil is a consolidation of a recent
price high in an uptrend, is getting tighter, does not violate
the 50 MA, and in this case is trending slightly downward.

While this run to over 10.50 yielded a 16 percent return

in less than two weeks, the stock continued higher and is
(cid:1)
currently trading 55 percent higher than the entry price.
FORD (Figure 9.4) shows another coiled spring
example. Note that the 20 MA is rising and is nicely above
a rising 50 MA, showing the stock to be in a strong
uptrend. Also note that candlestick tails can poke out of the
coil as long as the open and close of each candle stays
within it. Again, a buy signal is triggered once price trades
above the upper trendline. In this case the trade yielded
(cid:1)
over 50 percent in about one month.
Figure 9.5 is an example of another stock, CME, that
shows two coiled springs. Note the sideways to slightly
downtrending movement that marks the coiled spring, and
how many of the candles are getting smaller relative to pre-
vious candles seen in the uptrend. Note also the buy sig-
nals as they print just above the resistance lines.

THE BULLISH DIVERGENCE
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Range-bound markets
• Bullish: weakly trending markets
• Bearish: weakly trending markets
Characteristics This setup is really a workhorse for us.
We can use it in all sorts of markets, even bearish ones. The
markets spend most of their time in range-bound or weakly
trending conditions, and this setup works in those condi-
tions very well. As swing traders, we use the bullish diver-
gence setup to pinpoint the bottoms of deep pullbacks
(beyond the 50 MA) within long-range uptrends (see
following definition). We will also use a version of it in
another setup discussed later. Truly, the divergence tool



==================================================
                     PAGE 190                     
==================================================

SELECTING BULLISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 171
is a very handy one indeed. The bullish divergence setup
looks at a stock that is trading within a long-range uptrend,
but which is currently in a substantial sell-off and has just
put in a series of lower lows. This downtrending series
needs to be at least two lows long so that there is a basis for
comparison. Of course, too many lower lows will eventu-
ally negate the long-range uptrend, and thus nullify this
setup.
Key Indicators This setup relies on both price patterns
and a variety of technical indicators. Here are the specifics:
• First, we need to identify the stock as being in a
long-range uptrend (see definition). This supports
the idea that the deep pullback we enter on is
only a temporary aberration.
Definition: The easiest way to identify a long-
range uptrendis to note on the daily chart that the
50 MA (either rising or falling) is trading above
a rising 200 MA. Note: It is key that the 200 MA
is rising; this signals the uptrend. Once the 50
MA crosses under the 200 MA, even if the 200
MA is rising, the long-range uptrend is negated.
• Next, the bullish divergence setup is valid when
price does three things:
1. It trades below the 50 MA.
2. It puts in at least two clear price lows during
that pullback, with at least five trading days
between the lows.



==================================================

3. The last price low corresponds with a higher
low in two or more of the following technical
indicators: MACD, MACD histogram, stochas-
tics, RSI, OBV, and CCI (at the settings we
specified earlier).
• Note that if the last (lower) price low corresponds
with the 200 MA, trendline support, or prior
price support, so much the better.
• Buy signal: When the aforementioned conditions
have been met, a buy signal is triggered when
a bullish candle of some kind (doji, hammer,
engulfing, morning star, etc.) is printed on the
daily chart.
The Screening Tool The following screen inputted into
Stockcharts.com’s stock screener will identify potential
bullish divergence candidates:
• For the last market close:
• All stocks with . . .
• 60-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 10.
• Daily low for yesterday is less than daily low for
20 days ago.
• Daily low for yesterday is less than daily low for
three days ago.
• Daily MACD histogram (12,26,9) for today is
greater than daily MACD histogram (12,26,9)
for 15 days ago.

• Daily CCI (20) for today is greater than daily
CCI (20) for 15 days ago.
• Daily RSI (5) for today is greater than daily RSI
(5) for 15 days ago.
• 50-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 200-day simple moving average of
close for today.
• Daily open for today is less than daily close for
today.
In Figure 9.6, FWLT registers a nice bullish diver-
gence setup following a blow-off double bottom with a
lower price low coupled with three cases of bullish
divergence in the indicators: MACD, RSI, and CCI.
Note that on the day of entry the 50 MA (dotted line),
though falling, is still above a rising 200 MA (solid line),
and that on the day prior to entry we have a bullish can-
dlestick marking the second low (hammer candle). The
(cid:1)
shares went on to gain 25 percent in only 20 trading
days.
In Figure 9.7, see BRCM, which gave two nice bull-
ish divergence buy signals in the course of this choppy
runup. The trigger candle for the first setup was a doji and
for the second a hammer. Note that you need divergence
on only two indicators to validate the play. It is also inter-
esting to note that the buy-and-holder with shares held
from the left side to the right side of this chart would have
(cid:1)
seen her position increase by 24 percent, a nice run. But
consider what you would have gotten on two trend trades:
(cid:1)
40 percent with a lot less time exposed to the risks of the
market.

176 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
THE BLUE SKY BREAKOUT
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bullish: strongly trending markets
Characteristics Also called a cup-and-handle formation,
this setup is sometimes your only play during prolonged
bull markets when there just doesn’t seem to be any pull-
back. Some swing traders are forced by a strong bull mar-
ket to sit on the sidelines day after day, waiting for a pullback
or price consolidation to give them setups. How frustrating
is that when all those buy-and-holders are gloating over
their gains! But trend traders have a key weapon in their
arsenal during such times: the blue sky breakout setup. Blue
skyhere refers to the new high territory the stock trades up
into as it clears at least three months of prior price highs.
We confirm the breakout by looking at an indicator that
gives us a visual reference of recent trends in volume.
Key Indicators This setup relies on five price parame-
ters combined with one technical indicator: on balance vol-
ume (OBV). Here are the rules:
• First, the closing price of the stock (not just the
intraday move) must register a new high
following a previous new pivot high set within
the past 20 trading days. A pivot high is a new
price high followed by a sell-off or sideways
consolidation of at least five bars (but not more
than 20) in length. We set these limits because it
is important that the new high be the result of a



==================================================
                     PAGE 196                     
==================================================

SELECTING BULLISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 177
recent and short-lived move in price rather than a
prolonged runup.
• Second, the current new closing price high must
be a significant high; no higher closing price high
should be recorded in at least the past three
months of trading.
• Third, the new closing price high cannot have
run too far above the 52-week low for the stock.
We don’t want stocks that are too overextended.
To prevent this, we calculate a multiple by taking
the new high closing price and dividing it by the
52-week low price. This multiple should not be
more than 3.0. In other words, if a stock’s 52-
week low is 10.00, we want to buy a blue sky
breakout only if the new closing high is less than
30.00.
• Fourth, the current breakout into blue sky
territory (no price resistance within the previous
three months) should be accompanied by the
highest OBV reading seen in at least the past
three months (see definition).
Definition: OBV stands for on balance volume.
It measures the accumulation or distribution of
shares: share volume is either added to (on up
days) or subtracted from (on down days) a run-
ning balance of volume. OBV confirms price
moves when it runs with price, and shows diver-
gence when it runs against price. It tends to be a
leading rather than a lagging indicator and as
such is useful in predicting future price moves.

==================================================

178 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• Fifth, the candle on the day of the breakout to a
new high must be a green or white candle (close
higher than the open).
• Buy signal: When all five of these parameters have
been met on the same day, we have a buy signal.
The Screening Tool In a bull market, the following scan
should turn up several possible blue sky candidates—but
since that first price parameter cannot be screened for, a
further eyeballing of the charts is usually required to weed
out invalid setups:
• For the last market close:
• U.S. stocks with . . .
• New 52-week high.
• 20-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 10.
• Daily close for today is less than or equal to
minimum low over 260 days starting today
times 3.
• Daily OBV for today is greater than daily OBV
for 60 days ago.
In Figure 9.8, AAPL shows three blue sky breakout
signals. This kind of stair-stepping or repetitive cup-and-
handle pattern is common in strong, healthy uptrends and
often precedes a lengthy and extended bullish run. Note
that the new price highs were set within 20 days of a pre-
vious new high with at least three down days in between.

==================================================

Figure 9.8 AAPL showing blue sky breakout setups.
Also note the new high seen in OBV in each case. Further
note that by new highwe mean on a closing basis rather than
an intraday basis. Thus when drawing your lines on the
price chart, put them over the tops of the closing prices
rather than the upper “tails” of the candles. So healthy was
this trend, in fact, that AAPL made it all the way to 86.40
before succumbing to profit taking.
Our second example, CREE, (Figure 9.9) shows a
very profitable blue sky breakout. In late April, CREE set
a new five-month pivot high at the 20.00 price level. After
16 days of consolidation, the bulls stepped up again to drive
price higher. On April 22 we got our price breakout cou-
pled with a new high in OBV. We actually called this one

in our Trend Trade Newsletter, netting subscribers a quick

22 percent gain in 12 days. A longer hold could have
(cid:1)
banked something closer to 50 percent.
The blue sky breakout is truly a befriend-the-trend
kind of setup, and certainly one of the most exciting setups
to trade. But many traders are afraid to play this kind of
breakout because they worry the shares are too overbought
and extended. They needn’t be. In a strongly uptrending
market, your best bet is to “buy high and sell higher”.
Trends once begun tend to keep trending: this is the
essence of trend trading. But to keep the odds in your favor,
stick closely to the five rules we outlined above.

THE BULLISH BASE BREAKOUT
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bullish: weakly trending markets
• Bearish: strongly trending markets
• Bearish: weakly trending markets
• Range-bound markets
Characteristics This is another very useful setup that
can be traded in a variety of markets. It nicely rounds out
our series of bullish setups since it is not strictly a befriend-
the-trend kind of setup. Rather, in this setup we are going
to be contrarian, bucking the trend. Here we are looking
for a stock that is in a downtrend but has put in an extended
sideways base of some kind. The fact that the stock is now
moving sideways instead of down makes this base a bullish
one. To render the setup valid, we need the indicators to
tell us two things about price behavior within the base: it
has to be gaining in momentum, and there must be evidence
that shares are under accumulation. While longer holds of
this setup can return spectacular gains, there is often a quick
burst of buying activity at the point of breakout that can
(cid:1)
bring gains of 10 percent or more within a few days, mak-
ing this an ideal short-term, trend trade setup. Moreover,
this setup is most often seen in lower-priced stocks, so it is
an ideal setup for smaller account traders.
Key Indicators This setup relies on a price pattern (bull-
ish base) combined with two technical indicators: MACD
and on balance volume (OBV). Here are the specifics:



==================================================
                     PAGE 201                     
==================================================

182 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• First, the stock must be clearly seen to be in a
downtrend of some kind, strong or weak (see
definition).
Definition:A downtrending stockis a stock that is
making lower highs (and preferably lower lows,
but, strictly speaking, this is not necessary) over
at least the past three months. A strongly down-
trending stock is a downtrending stock whose 20
MA is consistently falling and below a consis-
tently falling 50 MA. A weaklydowntrendingstock
is a downtrending stock whose 20 MA may be
rising and falling, but it is at least mostly below a
consistently falling 50 MA.
• Second, for at least the past 30 trading days (six
weeks), price must be moving within a
consolidation base of some kind. There are two
types of consolidation bases: triangles and
rectangles. These bases can occur in uptrends as
well as downtrends. In this setup, we want to see
these at the bottom of a downtrend.
• Figures 9.10 and 9.11 are two types of rectan-

gle bases seen in downtrending markets (flat and

• Figures 9.12 through 9.14 are three types of
triangle bases seen in downtrending markets
(symmetrical, ascending, and descending.)
• The one type of consolidation pattern we want to
avoid is the rising wedge, a type of triangle
consolidation that occurs in downtrending stocks,
but which usually precedes a continuation of
the downtrend. A rising wedge does not form a
valid base for this setup. Rising wedges look like
Figure 9.15, where both trendlines slope upward.

==================================================

184 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• Once we have identified a consolidation base in a
downtrending stock, we need to confirm that it is
a bullish base. We do this by referring to two
technical indicators: MACD and OBV.
• MACD must be making a series of higher lows
while price is within the base may or may not be
making higher lows.
• OBV must rise above a trendline placed over
the tops of the indicator.
• Buy signal: A buy signal is triggered in a bullish
base at the first green or white candle (close
higher than the open) after the candlestick on
which the OBV trendline broke to the upside.
You can also enter on the day of an OBV break if
that candle is green or white.
The Screening Tool It is not possible to screen for
triangular or rectangular bases using what is commonly
available. Most of your trades in this setup will have to
come from your watch lists as you eyeball the charts. But
the following screen will turn up a few decent candidates
among many false hits that can be short-listed for further
research. Readers who are more adept at this sort of thing
than I am might want to fiddle around with these parame-
ters to make them more robust.
• For the last market close:
• U.S. stocks with . . .
• 20-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.

• 50-day simple moving average of close for today
is less than 50-day simple moving average of

• Maximum range over 30 days starting today is
greater than maximum range over 15 days start-

• Maximum range over 15 days starting today is
greater than maximum range over 5 days start-
ing today.
• Daily OBV for today is greater than daily OBV
for 40 days ago.
• Daily MACD line (12,26,9) for today is greater
than daily MACD line (12,26,9) for 40 days
ago.
• 50-day simple moving average of close for today
is less than 200-day simple moving average of
close for today.
In the absence of a reliable screen, you will have to
check the charts on your watch list on a regular basis. In
fact, this is a better way to go because it allows you to watch
a base develop over several days and weeks. That OBV trig-
ger signal is really the key to this setup: if you can get in
on the day that happens, you often will be in at the start of
a significant rally. But the stocks that show up on the pre-

ceding screen most often have already triggered their OBV
signal.
In Figure 9.16, AKS shows a weak downtrend coiling
up within a bullish triangular (symmetrical) base. We can
see that MACD shows higher lows (bullish confirmation)
and that OBV triggered a buy signal after price broke up
out of the base. From there the stock quickly climbed
nearly 20 percent over seven trading days.

In Figure 9.17, KLAC consolidates a strong down-
trend capped by a nasty gap down within a bullish rec-
tangular base. We know it is bullish because MACD, which
measures price momentum, is rising throughout the base.
OBV then gives a buy signal just prior to the base break-
out. An entry around 42.00 would have returned a healthy

firming that the base is a bullish one. When OBV triggered
a breakout of its trendline, we had confirmation that shares
of JNPR were being accumulated. Price often follows an
OBV breakout, and, sure enough, shares of JNPR did just
that. Shortly after the falling rectangle gave way, JNPR

selecting
bearish stocks
to trend-trade
SHORT SELLING
Short selling, or shorting, is an essential skill for trend trad-
ers. Technically, it is not much different from buying shares
of a stock to open a position and then selling those shares
back to the market to close the position. Only in short sell-
ing, you reverse that order: first you sell shares to the mar-
ket, then to close the position you buy them back. If your
open position trades down below your entry price, money
will be credited to your account on the purchase of stock.
If your open position trades up above your entry price,
money will be taken out of your account to cover the loss.
Since you can only sell shares to the market that you
already own, you must first borrow from your broker the
shares needed to open a short position. Thus, whether your
broker has the shares to borrow in the first place is an
essential part of the short-selling equation: if your broker
has no shares to lend, you have no shares to borrow in order
to sell short. Generally, most good online brokers keep a
healthy supply of shares to lend on all major, liquid stocks.
The stocks we normally trade at Befriendthetrend.com are
almost always available to short. Occasionally, however, you

will find yourself in the frustrating predicament of having
done a lot of research on a chart only to discover that you
cannot open the position because your broker doesn’t have
shares to borrow. Even more frustrating is seeing that stock
tank hard for days on end—without you on board. An
alternative to selling the stock short, then, is buying put
options on the stock. As explained in Part Four, buying
puts on a stock is a way to profit from a selloff in the stock;
and it is sometimes your only alternative when your broker
is out of shares to borrow.
Some say that short selling is un-American or that it
somehow hurts the general economy. Others say that it is
beneficial to the overall health of the market in that it sup-
plies much-needed liquidity to the buyers of stock, espe-
cially during prolonged bull markets. But I don’t think you
can make a strong case either way. For every buyer there
must be a seller, and it makes little difference whether you
sell your own shares or your broker’s shares. In fact, when
you sell your own shares, that terminates your relationship
with the company and its public offerings. When you short
using borrowed shares, you have, in fact, entered into a
promissory agreement with that company to make a pur-
chase of its shares at some point in the future (on behalf of
your broker, of course, not your own account).
There is also the perception that short selling is a
higher-risk activity than simply buying stock. The ratio-
nale behind this is that, while your long positions can go to
zero and wipe out your entire investment, a short position
can rally to infinity (in theory), thus wiping out not only
your investment but all your cash reserves as well, not to
mention every other asset you own. And then there is the

==================================================

SELECTING BEARISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 193
numbers game: a stock that goes from $50 to $25 takes a
50 percent haircut off your investment; however, if that
same stock sold short were to rally from $25 to $50, you
are out 100 percent of your original investment.
Several things need to be said here in defense of short
selling. First, there are easy ways of managing your short
positions in order to play them defensively, which we will
discuss later. These keep your losses to a minimum when
a trade goes against you. Second, long before your entire
account is wiped out, your broker is going to give you a
margin callin the event that your short positions get to the
point that they jeopardize your ability to trade (it is in your
broker’s best interests to keep you trading). In most mar-
gin calls, your broker will simply exit your positions for you
if you don’t do it yourself within a given time period.
Third, far more companies go bankrupt and trade to penny
stock status than soar to infinity, so the overall trend is on
the side of relative safety. Fourth, the short-selling systems
described here have at least a 70 percent success rate. They
are oriented toward making money, not losing it. In short
(pardon the pun), with the right trading and position man-
agement systems in place, the risks of short selling are far
outweighed by the rewards.
TOP FIVE BEARISH SETUPS
If you are looking for trend trades on the short side, with
the expectation that price will fall after entry, then you will
be looking for one or more of the following setups. When
you come across a stock on your watch list fitting one or
more of these setups, jot it down on a piece of paper. Once



==================================================

==================================================

194 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
you have finished eyeballing your primary watch list, you
should have a short set of stocks you will then do further
research on. You may also add to this list stocks that turn
up on your special screens.
The Relief Rally
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bearish: strongly trending markets
• Bearish: weakly trending markets
Characteristics This setup is really the inverse of the
pullback setup mentioned previously. Here we are looking
for a stock that is strongly or weakly downtrending but has
rallied up off its lows to reach a major moving average,
which should act as resistance. We always wait to enter until
we get confirmation of an overbought condition—as seen
in the stochastics indicator—and a confirming bearish can-
dlestick of some kind. The relief rally itself may just be a
spate of short-term profit taking or a short squeeze (where
shorts are forced to cover their positions and buy back
shares due to a surprising reversal), or it may be in response
to news or an earnings announcement. Regardless, once the
reevaluation of shares plays itself out, the dominant trend
usually emerges again. The odds of this happening are
heightened when this play is put on when a bearish trend
is seen in the broader market.
Key Indicators In this setup there are three key ingre-
dients:



==================================================
                     PAGE 214                     
==================================================

SELECTING BEARISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 195
• First, identify a strongly or weakly downtrending
stock that has rallied up into a downsloping
20 MA (strongly downtrending) or 50 MA
(weakly downtrending). If this moving average
coincides with, or is placed near, a downsloping
trendline placed over the highs of the downtrend,
so much the better.
Definition: A downtrending stock is defined as a
stock that is consistently making lower highs (and
preferably lower lows, but, strictly speaking, this
is not necessary). A strongly downtrending stock is
a downtrending stock whose 20 MA is always
falling and below a falling 50 MA. The further
these two MAs are separated, the stronger the
downtrend. A weakly downtrending stockis a down-
trending stock whose 20 MA is mostly falling and
is below a falling 50 MA.
• Second, there must be a sharp rise in stochastics
(five-period) to or above the overbought 80 line.
• Third, the price on the rally to that moving
average must have put in a bearish candle of some
kind (doji, engulfing, gravestone, hanging man,
evening star, etc.). If it has put in a green or
white candle (close above the open), then this is a
wait-and-see condition. You should make a note
to check that stock again the next trading day.
• Sell short signal: These three factors register a sell
short signal and the stock is ready to be short-
listed as a valid relief rally setup.

The Screening Tool There are occasions in the natu-
ral course of market cycles when relief rally setups do not
appear very often. If you fail to find any decent relief
rallies on your primary watch list, you can try using a
special screen to search the universe of stocks for them.
When I do this, I input the following criteria into
Stockcharts.com’s screening tool:
• For the last market close:
• All stocks with . . .
• 60-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 10.
• The chart has a bearish engulfing pattern for
today.
• 20-day simple moving average of close for today
is less than 50-day simple moving average of
close for today.
• Daily close for today is greater than daily close
for five days ago times 1.15.
Normally, half a dozen stocks appear from this screen,
depending on market conditions. If the list is too large, I
will increase the volume to 1,000,000 and the daily close
five days ago multiplier to 1.20. If the list is too small, I will
decrease the multiplier to 1.10 or less.
Figure 10.1 is an example of a downtrending stock,
NVDA, that gave two relief rally sell short signals: the first
during a weak downtrend with a rally into the 50 MA, and
the second after the trend got stronger with a reliefrally only
into the 20 MA. Also note that we have two bearish candle

formations in both cases: a bearish engulfing at the first sig-
nal and a shooting star doji at the second signal. You will also
note that on July 9 there was an additional signal that failed
to yield the desired result, unless you used a wide stop-loss.
Figure 10.2 shows another example ofa weakly becom-
ing strongly downtrending stock, QLGC, which gave four
relief rally sell short signals within four months. It is rare to
get so many short signals in such a short time period, but
when they happen like this, it is a trader’s dream come true.
Note that tightly trailing stops would have done well to lock
in substantial profits on at least three of the trades. A rea-
(cid:1)
sonable return on this sequence of trades is in the 50 to
(cid:1)
60 percent range, while the buy-and-holder had to sit
through a very uncomfortable 55 percent drawdown.

The Bearish Divergence
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Range-bound markets
• Bearish: weakly trending markets
• Bullish: weakly trending markets
Characteristics This setup is the flip side of its bullish
cousin noted previously, and as such is also a great work-
horse for us. We can use it in all sorts of markets, both
bearish and bullish. As trend traders, we use the bearish
divergence setup to pinpoint the tops of sharp rallies
(beyond the 50 MA) within long-range downtrends. We
will also use a version of it in another setup discussed later.



==================================================
                     PAGE 218                     
==================================================

SELECTING BEARISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 199
Truly, the divergence tool is a very handy one indeed. The
bearish divergence setup looks at a stock that is trading
within a long-range downtrend, but which is currently in
a substantial rally, and has just put in a series of higher
highs. This uptrending series needs to be at least two highs
long so that there is a basis for comparison. Of course, too
many higher highs will eventually negate the long-range
downtrend and thus nullify this setup.
Key Indicators This setup relies on both a price pattern
and a variety of technical indicators. Here are the specifics:
• First, we need to identify the stock as being in a
long-range downtrend (see definition). This
supports the idea that the sharp rally we enter on
is only a temporary aberration.
Definition: The easiest way to identify a long-
range downtrendis to note on the daily chart that
the 50 MA, either rising or falling, is trading
below a falling 200 MA. Note: It is essential that
the 200 MA is falling; this signals the down-
trend.
• Next, the bearish divergence setup is valid when
price does three things:
• It trades above the 50 MA.
• It puts in at least two clear price highs during
that rally, with at least five trading days between
the highs.
• The last price high corresponds with a lower
high in two or more of the following technical



==================================================
                     PAGE 219                     
==================================================

200 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
indicators: MACD, MACD histogram, stochas-
tics, OBV, CCI, or RSI.
• Note that if the last (higher) price high
corresponds with the 200 MA, trendline
resistance, or prior price resistance, so much
the better.
• Sell Short Signal: When the preceding conditions
have been met, a sell short signal is triggered
when a bearish candle of some kind (doji,
gravestone, engulfing, evening star, etc.) is
printed on the daily chart.
The Screening Tool When eyeballing your watch list
fails to turn up any relief rally setups, the following screen
inputted into Stockcharts.com’s stock screener should iden-
tify several possible candidates:

high for 20 days ago.
• Daily high for yesterday is greater than daily
high for three days ago.
• Daily MACD histogram (12,26,9) for today is
less than daily MACD histogram (12,26,9) for

• Daily ROC (12) for today is less than daily

downsloping 200 MA along with an area of former price
resistance (20.00 area).
The Gap Down
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bullish strong trending markets
• Bullish weakly trending markets
• Range-bound markets
Characteristics The gap down setup employs a con-
trarian trading style. This setup trades stocks that are in
strong uptrends but have just printed an unfilled gap down;
that is, they gap down sharply at the open and fail during
the day to close the gap. This setup requires that the gap
down occur only after a significant new high (highest price
for at least three months) has been established. This is the
reason they work best in bull markets. Any stock climbing
to new highs in a bear market is a safe-haven stock and
should be avoided by short sellers. Frequently this setup
signals a strong reversal of trend, as investors panic and
rush to the exits in order to lock in profits in the wake of
bad news, disappointing earnings, profit taking, and so on.
This setup has a tendency to take a few days to get started
as bears fend off the dip-buying crowd. But once they win
control, and they usually do after a gap down, the drop can
be sharp and fast.
Key Indicators This setup is very easy to spot and trade.
Here are the specifics:



==================================================
                     PAGE 223                     
==================================================

204 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• First, we need to identify the stock as being in a
steady uptrend. For the purposes of this setup, we
define a steady uptrend as follows:
• The 50 MA is rising steadily without any major
dips.
• Price has remained above the 50 MA for at least
the past 40 trading days (two months).
• Second, there needs to be an unfilled gap down on
the current candlestick (see definition).
Definition: An unfilled gap down is identified
when, on the market’s close, a stock’s intraday
high price remains below the intraday low of the
preceding day’s trading.
• Sell short signal: When these conditions have been
met, a sell short signal is triggered anytime after
the gap down day when price trades below the
intraday low of the gap down candlestick. Note: If
at any time price trades up into the gap prior to
triggering the sell signal, the setup is negated.
The Screening Tool Several premium charting pack-
ages, including eSignal and Quote.com, offer an unfilled
gap hotlist function, but this does not screen for uptrend-
ing stocks. However, the following screen parameters,
when inputted into Stockcharts.com’s stock screener, will
search daily for gap down setups in uptrending stocks.
• For the last market close:
• All stocks with . . .

• Breakaway gap down.
• 60-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 10.
• 20-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 50-day simple moving average of
close for today times 1.1.
The chart of EBAY in Figure 10.5 shows the gap
down setup following a strong uptrend. Note that the
intraday high on the gap down day remained below the low
of the previous trading day, and that the 50 MA is in a
steady uptrend.

shortly after the gap down setup was confirmed. Note that

gapped down again. With an opening price below the pre-
vious day’s low, we had our entry signal. While it took a
few days to consolidate the new bearish posture, once price
resumed its new trend, it really took off.
The chart of SWIR in Figure 10.7 shows another gap
down setup following a strong uptrend. Note that the gap
down candlestick here is quite long, which may lead some
to conclude that the position has already gone too far to
warrant an entry. Never underestimate the power of a gap
down. It is truly a trend killer. All that is needed to com-
plete this setup is a trade below the low of the unfilled gap
down day’s candle.
Although it took three days to get moving again after
that big red stick, and indeed to trigger our sell short entry
signal, SWIR shows just how powerful the gap down setup
can be (Figure 10.8). Note that SWIR’s gap down into a

rising moving average may have looked tempting to the
“buy the dip” crowd. Consider this a warning: never buy a
dip to support in an uptrending stock that takes place after
an unfilled gap down, however strong the uptrend! You are
likely to get caught in a bull trap.
The Blue Sea Breakdown
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bearish: strongly trending markets
Characteristics Think of this as a reverse cup-and-
handle formation. Like its bullish cousin outlined in the
previous chapter, this setup is sometimes your only play
during prolonged bear markets when there just doesn’t
seem to be any relief in sight. Blue seahere refers to the new
low territory the stock trades down into as it clears at least
three months of prior price lows. We confirm the break-
down by looking at an indicator that gives us a visual ref-
erence of recent trends in volume.
Key Indicators This setup relies on five price parame-
ters combined with one technical indicator: on balance vol-
ume (OBV). Here are the rules:
• First, the closing price of the stock (not just the
intraday move) must register a new low following
a previous new low set within the past 20 trading
days. It is important that the new low be the



==================================================
                     PAGE 228                     
==================================================

SELECTING BEARISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 209
result of a recent and short-lived move in price
rather than a prolonged sell-off.
• Second, the current new closing price low must
be a significant low; no low closing price low
should be recorded in at least the past three
months of trading.
• Third, the new closing price low cannot have run
too far below the 52-week high for the stock. We
don’t want stocks that are too overextended to the
downside. To prevent this, we calculate a multiple
by taking the 52-week high and divide it by the
new low closing price. This multiple should not
be more than 2.0. In other words, if a stock’s 52-
week high is 30.00, we would sell short a blue sea
breakdown only if the new closing low is greater
than 15.00.
• Fourth, the current breakdown into blue sea
territory (no price support within the previous
three months) should be accompanied by the
lowest OBV reading seen in at least the past three
months.
• Fifth, the candle on the day of the breakdown to
a new low must be a red or black candle (close is
lower than the open).
• Sell short signal: When all five of the these
parameters have been met on the same day, we
have a sell short signal.
The Screening Tool In bull markets this screen will not
return many candidates, but in a strong bear market it

should turn up several possible blue sea candidates. Since
that first price parameter cannot be screened for, a further
eyeballing of the charts is usually required to weed out
invalid setups.
• For the last market close:
• U.S. stocks with . . .
• New 52-week low.
• 20-day simple moving average of volume for to-
day is greater than 500,000.
• 60-day simple moving average of close for today
is greater than 5.
• Daily close for today is greater than or equal to
maximum high over 260 days starting today
times 0.5.
• Daily OBV for today is less than daily OBV for
60 days ago.
In Figure 10.9, JNPR shows a blue sea breakdown sig-
nal as it passes below a three-month low with confirming
new low in the OBV indicator. An entry at the open of the
next trading day could have been covered nine days later,
(cid:1)
for a maximum gain of 17 percent. The stock rallied
shortly after that, so you would likely have been stopped
(cid:1)
out for something more like 12 percent.
In Figure 10.10, we see XMSR confirming a blue sea
breakdown with supportive OBV on the last day of April.
In this case, OBV first broke down to a new three-month
low, and the stock price did not confirm the breakdown
until the next day. However, once it confirmed—BAM!—
(cid:2)
the stock got a 50 percent haircut. Note that the stock is

clearly in a steady downtrend as signaled by the steadily

lines factor into this setup since a new three-month price
low is evidence enough that we are in a downtrend.
One further thing to note about the XMSR chart in
Figure 10.10 is just how abruptly the downtrend can end
in a blue sea breakdown. With no immediate support under
price, these trades tend to move down quickly and sharply.
But when bottom-feeding hedgies (hedge fund traders)
smell blood in the water, they like to move in with size, cre-
ating panic among the shorts. That is the power of short-
covering: it is price manipulation at its worst and can wipe
out weeks of gains on the short side in a matter of hours.

Figure 10.10 XMSR shows a blue sea breakout setup.
If you are on the right side of the trade it can be a beauti-
ful thing, but if you are short it is your worst nightmare.
Still, with the right stop-loss, this trade could easily have
(cid:1)
netted over a 40 percent return in three months. Even a
(cid:1)
shorter-term hold of four weeks would have netted a 25
percent return on equity, and in a down market no less.
That truly is trend trading for a living!

The Rising Wedge Breakdown
Market Type This setup is best used in:
• Bullish: weakly trending markets
• Bullish: strongly trending markets
• Range-bound markets
Characteristics This final setup is similar but not iden-
tical to the bullish base breakout mentioned previously.
Like its bullish cousin, this setup can be traded in a vari-
ety of markets. It is also a contrarian play. Here we are
looking for a stock that is in an uptrend but is ready to fall
out of that trend in dramatic fashion. The wedge is created
when the oscillations of the uptrend get narrower and nar-
rower. To render the setup valid, we need to see indicators
tell us two things about price behavior within the wedge:
its momentum has to be slowing down and there needs to
be evidence that shares are being distributed (sold) more
than accumulated (bought). While longer holds of this
setup can return spectacular gains, there is often a quick
burst of selling activity at the point of breakdown that can
(cid:1)
bring gains of 10 percent or more within a few days,
making this an ideal trend trade setup.
Key Indicators This setup relies on a price pattern (ris-
ing wedge) combined with two technical indicators: MACD
and on balance volume (OBV). Here are the specifics:



==================================================
                     PAGE 233                     
==================================================

214 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• First, the stock must be clearly seen to be in an
uptrend of some kind, either strong or weak (see
preceding definition).
• Second, the up and down swings of the uptrend
must be trading within a narrower and narrower
range. When this happens, price prints a pattern
called a wedge. You can better visualize the
wedge by drawing in support and resistance
trendlines under the bottoms of lows and over
the tops of highs in the uptrend. To qualify as a
wedge, you must have at least three price point
touches (not high or low pivots, but simply
intraday touches) at each trendline, and the more
touches, the better.
• Rising wedges can have a flat top like the as-
cending triangle shown in Figure 10.11.
• Or they can look like the pattern shown in Fig-
ure 10.12, where both trendlines are rising.
• Once we have identified a wedge pattern in an
uptrending stock, we need to confirm that it is a
bearish rising wedge. We do this by referring to
two technical indicators: MACD and OBV.

==================================================

SELECTING BEARISH STOCKS TO TREND-TRADE 215
• MACD must be making a series of lower highs
while price is within the wedge (price may or
may not be making lower highs).
• OBV must fall below a trendline placed under
the lows of the indicator.
• Sell short signal: A sell short signal is triggered in a
rising wedge at the first red or black candle (close
is lower than the open) after the candlestick on
which the OBV trendline broke to the downside.
You can also enter on the day of an OBV break if
that candle is red or black.
The Screening Tool It is not possible to screen for ris-
ing wedges using what is commonly available, but the fol-
lowing screen will turn up a few decent candidates among
many false hits that can be short-listed for further research.
Readers who are more adept at this sort of thing than I am
might want to fiddle around with these parameters to make
them more robust.

daily MACD Line (12,26,9) for 40 days ago.
• 50-day simple moving average of close for today

of close for today.
In the absence of a solid screen, you will just have to
eyeball the charts on your watch list. In fact, this is a bet-
ter way to go because it allows you to watch a wedge
develop over several days and weeks. That OBV trigger sig-
nal is really the key to this setup: if you can get in on the
day that happens, you often will be in at the very start of a
significant trend-down sell-off. The stocks that show up on
the preceding screen most often have already triggered
their OBV trendline signal.
In Figure 10.13, NVDA begins to trade within a nar-
rowing range or wedge just before breaking down. Note
that once we have the two trendlines in place we can clearly
see that the support line is rising at a steeper pace than the
resistance line. The indicators told us ahead of time that

trouble was ahead, and indeed it was. An entry at the close
on the day of the sell short trigger—the break of the OBV

trendline—would have returned 30 percent at the maxi-
mum extension of the trade in just about four weeks. Note,
too, that the sell short trigger occurred prior to price
breaking down out of the wedge pattern.

the wedge, this is still a valid signal and can be entered on
the close of the trigger day at a price of 20.75. Note the
bearish candle on the trigger day and the bearish diver-
gence seen in the MACD indicator.
That wedge breakdown sell trigger signaled the end
to CSCO’s uptrend. After price took a few sessions to clear
the lower edge of the trendline, it was a slow and steady
drop over the next two months to hit a closing low of 17.24,

to do is whittle this list of possible plays down to only the
most highly qualified, most riskworthy candidates, which
you will monitor the next trading day for entries. Input
each stock into your Stockcharts.com chart setup with all
the indicators I’ve listed in the aforementioned setups.
Make sure the chart is large enough to get a good, clear pic-
ture of at least six months of daily data. You then put each
setup through a series of tests. Do not—I repeat, do not—
be tempted to skip this further testing. It is tedious and
sometimes yields few results, but it is absolutely essential if
you want to streamline your shortlist down to the one or
two best possible trades for the day. In this process you are
going from your B-list to your A-list ofstocks. This last step
is key to putting the greatest number of odds on your side.
Here is how you would further test or screen your
shortlists per the various setups we have just discussed.
Bullish Setups
The pullback: You will favor stocks where ...
• Volume on the dip to support is lower than
average.
• There is no close during the dip under the 50 MA.

indicators.
• Price has not put in a double top formation (two
equal price highs) on the daily chart.

This final screening process will force you to focus
only on those stocks that have the highest technical merit.
This final list is now ready for one last question, and it is
an all-important one: Is the risk/reward ratio worth taking a
chance on?
To calculate a stock’s risk/reward ratio, divide the per-
centage of your expected gain by the percentage of your
initial stop-loss. If you plan on trailing a stop-loss (to be
explained in the Chapter 11) as the trade moves in your
favor, then you will need only a 1.25 ratio or better. For

(cid:1)
example, if your target price is 10 percent, then you can
afford a stop-loss of (8 percent because as the trade moves
in your favor, this percentage loss gets smaller and smaller,
and your risk/reward ratio becomes more favorable. The
best risk/reward scenarios, however, start at 2.0 or better.
Any setup that cannot predict at least a 10 percent return
before running into significant resistance should be
scratched.
One final note: Don’t be afraid to say, even after sev-
eral hours of hard work, that you simply do not have any
setups that have either enough technical merit or a high
enough risk/reward ratio to warrant your investment. As
Donald Trump says, “Sometimes the best investments are
the ones you don’t make.” Not that we need to take invest-
ment advice from The Donald, but the point is well taken:
it is best to stand aside and see what the next day’s trading
offers than to risk good money in less-than-optimal trades.

EFORE going further, let me take a moment here to
remind you of what was written earlier about trading psy-
chology. There I listed several major resources that will
help traders work through the emotional and tempera-
mental issues that can so often undermine even the most
robust trading systems. If you skipped over that section,
and if you (like me) struggle with strictly following the
trading plan you have laid out, then I suggest you go back
and read through that section of the book again. Study one
or more of the resources listed there. Spend a week on your
emotional control and you will go far toward establishing
a lifetime of profitable trading.
ENTERING THE TRADE
If you find a stock that satisfies all the requirements of a
particular setup, and it has passed your further screening
process and presents a favorable risk/reward ratio, then
entering that trade is merely a matter of picking the best
entry price and setting an order with the broker for that
price. In every case for all the setups, I recommend the fol-

lowing as the most reasonable and profitable way to pick
the best entry price.
For Long Setups
• Once all your requirements for a valid entry have
been satisfied on the chart, enter the trade on a
stop order set at either $0.02 (for slower-moving
stocks) or $0.05 (for faster-moving stocks) above
the intraday high of the previous trading day.
• If the stock gaps up above this buy point, then set
a limit order for that price and wait for the price
to come back down. If it never hits this buy price,
then consider the trade a scratch and move on.
For Short Setups
• Once all your requirements for a valid entry have
been satisfied on the chart, enter the trade on a
stop order to sell at either $0.02 (for slower-
moving stocks) or $0.05 (for faster-moving
stocks) below the intraday low of the previous
trading day.
• If the stock gaps down below this sell short point,
then set a limit order for that price and wait for
the price to come back up. If it never hits this sell
short price, then either pay up for your shares or
consider the trade a scratch and move on.
Let me add to that last note an important principle:
the entry is the least important part of trading. Too many
traders angst out over shaving a penny or two off their
entry price. I’ve seen traders abandon excellent, extremely

profitable setups simply because they were afraid of paying
up a nickel for their shares. So don’t worry about the entry.
If you’ve got a great setup and your entry price is not hit
by the end of the day, don’t skimp. Pay up and adjust your
stop and target accordingly.
Entering the trade is the easy part. Knowing when to
exit, now that is hard. Not only is it hard, but for most mor-
tals it is close to impossible to exit a trade anywhere near
the right time. When a trade goes against us, we either
panic and sell too soon or entertain irrational hopes and
hold on too long. When a trade moves in our favor, we
either exit too soon out of fear or hang on too long out of
greed. The true geniuses of trading, the masters of the
mouse who can turn the chaotic noise of the markets into
profitable events, are all extremely proficient at knowing
when to exit trades.
That kind of genius, that sixth sense that seems to
know intuitively just when a price will pivot, is probably a
birthright, a divine gift. For the rest of us, we need hard-
and-fast rules; rules that, if followed, will restrain our emo-
tions and rational minds long enough to keep us from
making the kind of embarrassing clown trades I described
in the Introduction. In the following section I outline the
rules. There are several exit strategies suggested here. Try
each one for yourself to determine which strategy best fits
your trading style.
STOP-LOSSES
Once you are in a trade, you will need to put into action
your exit strategy. That strategy must take into account
two different possibilities: the trade goes against you and



==================================================
                     PAGE 249                     
==================================================

230 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
you need to exit in order to cut your loss short, or the trade
goes in your favor and you need to bank the profit before,
inevitably, the momentum fades. In this section we will deal
with the first of these two possibilities: how to manage
losses.
Remember, we are not position traders and not buy-
and-holders. Trend trading is not about trying to grab the
full move of a stock’s price, only the “meat” of the current
(cid:1)
trend. We want a high percentage of wins (at least 60 per-
(cid:1)
cent, but up to 80 percent is possible with some systems
and in certain market conditions), small losses, and no
regrets about banking small profits. Obviously, we want
our profits to run, but we are quick on the trigger to bank
those profits when they begin to dwindle (and they nearly
always will if you hold long enough). The way we minimize
our losses in the event a trade turns against us is to set a
stop-loss.
Every trade you put on needs to have an exact price at
which you will definitely sell it in the event the trade goes
against you. This is what we call a stop-loss: a specified exit
you will takeno matter whatin order to cut your losses. One
more time: every trade needs a stop-loss, and a stop-loss is
that exact price (not a notional, in-your-head price
“area”—give me a break!) at which you will close the posi-
tion in the event of a loss or decrease in profit.
I teach my students four different methods for setting
stop-losses. The method that works best for you depends
on the kind of trader you are, your trading experience, your
chart-reading experience, your tolerance for risk, and so
on. I recommend experimenting with these four types of
stops to see which is most profitable for you. Remember,



==================================================
                     PAGE 250                     
==================================================

ENTRIES AND EXITS 231
the only wrong way to put on a stop-loss is to put on no
stop-loss. The four stop-loss methods are:
• A percentage stop-loss
• A price pattern stop-loss
• An average true range stop-loss
• A parabolic SAR stop-loss
Percentage Stop-Loss
The percentage stop-loss is the easiest to set. It works this
way: to set a stop-loss, simply calculate a percentage loss
from your point of entry and set the stop at that price. In
trend trading, your expected percentage return varies from
stock to stock, depending on the issue’s volatility and the
pattern or setup you are trading. In most cases, however,
due to the relatively short-term nature of these trades, you
−
will want to set a stop-loss no greater than 8 percent on
any given trade no matter what you expect to gain from a
successful completion of the trade. You should move this
stop at the end of each day, as long as the trade moves in
your favor, recalculating the percentage stop from the cur-
rent closing price. Some online brokerages will allow for a
trailing stop, which will automatically recalculate your stop-
loss at every new intraday high (if long) or low (if short), or
at every new closing price if you select that option.
Price Pattern Stop-Loss
A more sophisticated stop-loss, and the one I use myself, is
the price pattern stop-loss: here we want to look for an area
on the chart of nearby price support (if long) or resistance



==================================================
                     PAGE 251                     
==================================================

232 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
(if short) that if price were to violate that area would sig-
nal that the trade is not likely to work out. Price support
or resistance can come in the form of a major moving
average, an area of previous price reversal, or a trendline.
Traders familiar with Bollinger Bands or other forms of
standard deviation envelopes can also use those tools to set
price pattern stops.
The price pattern stop-loss is a more reasonable way
to apply stop-losses in that, instead of relying on an arbi-
trary distance away from the entry price, it uses a distance
suggested by the price action of the stock itself. Further-
more, a price pattern stop gives you a quick read on the
risk/reward ratio. Say, for example, your stock is in a strong
uptrend and has pulled back to the 50 MA and then trig-
gered an entry signal only 3 percent above that MA, and at
the same time you calculate a target price of 12 percent.
This would prove to be an excellent risk/reward entry. But
in every case, I recommend not risking more than an 8 per-
cent loss on any given trade. In most trades you should set
a stop-loss at something more like 5 to 6 percent. The aver-
age loss in our Swing Trade Newsletter, for example, is 4.76
percent. Leave it to the investors and position traders to
take the double-digit losses!
Average True Range (ATR)
A third way to calculate a stop-loss is to use the average
true range(ATR) of the stock. The “R” in ATR stands for
the range of intraday movement a stock makes from its
intraday high to its intraday low; the “T” is there because

price, thus incorporating any overnight gap; and the “A”
signifies that a running average of these figures is what
makes up the indicator’s end value. The ATR is a mea-
surement of the intraday volatility of the stock. As shares
tend to trade within a larger intraday range, ATR moves
up. As price consolidates and the intraday moves tighten,
ATR moves down. Using ATR to set your stop-loss means
you are correlating the amount you are willing to lose with
the stock’s volatility: the greater the volatility, the greater
the potential reward, but also the greater the potential
loss.
Most charting packages will calculate ATR for you.
The default periodicity for the ATR is usually set at 14,
which works just fine. Double the ATR value and in most
cases you have a reasonable place to set a stop-loss. If that
figure is more than 8 percent from the entry price, the
stock may be too volatile for a swing trade and should
either be entered very lightly with a tighter stop or not
entered at all. The ATR has the added advantage of giving
you a valuable tool for position sizing, and it is used in a
variety of formulas by fund managers seeking to reduce
risk in their portfolios.
Parabolic SAR Stop
A fourth and final way to input a stop-loss, the parabolic
SAR stop-loss, can also be done with your charting package.
Most charting packages will allow you to overlay a para-
bolic SAR (stop and reverse) indicator on the price chart.
This indicator was developed by Welles Wilder as a means
of trading volatile stocks in a stop-and-reverse fashion: if

you were stopped out long, you would immediately go
short, and vice versa. The indicator doesn’t work that well
on most stocks as an SAR entry system, but it is a handy
tool for setting stop exits. The SAR overlay consists of a
series of dots under each day’s candlestick. Some lie under
price lows and some lie above price highs. As the stock
moves up and down, these dots change location. They
even change if the stock trades flat. The parabolic SAR is
designed as both a price and a time stop: if the trade goes
nowhere, or even if it goes against you, your stop-loss
tightens up regardless—hence, the parabolic effect of the
tool.
Your charting package will tell you the value of the
current day’s SAR, so that value is then your stop price.
Figure 11.1 is an example of a chart with the parabolic SAR
overlay on it (MRVL). You can see that the SAR nicely
catches the major trends, but it loses money during chop-
pier market moves.
HOW TO BANK YOUR PROFITS
The second possibility with your open position occurs
when the trade moves in your favor. Here you are left with
the more pleasurable but admittedly very difficult decision
of choosing when to exit the trade with the greatest amount
of profit. Many traders struggle more with selling too early
than with cutting losses.
I teach my students four different methods for tak-
ing profits on their trades. Again, the method that works
best for you depends on the kind of trader you are, your
trading experience, your chart-reading experience, your

tolerance for risk, and so on. I recommend experiment-
ing with these four types of profit exits and see which
works best for you. Remember, no one goes broke tak-
ing profits. The four profit exit methods we will cover
here are:
• A percentage profit exit
• A price support or resistance profit exit
• An average true range profit exit
• The trailing stop profit exit
Percentage Profit Exit
The simplest exit strategy is to use a percentage profit exit.
Here you should place a profit target limit order to close
the trade at a percentage removed from your entry price
that is 1.5 to 2.0 times that of your stop-loss. For example,
−
if you have set a 5.0 percent stop-loss, then you would set

                     PAGE 255                     
==================================================

236 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
(cid:1) (cid:1)
your profit limit order somewhere between 7.5 and 10.0
percent. Your stop-loss order may change as the stock
moves in your favor, but you must keep your profit limit
order in place at all times. The trade is considered closed
when either one or the other is hit and executes. With the
kind of volatile, high-beta stocks we screen for, this usu-
ally happens within a few days.
Price Resistance or Price Support Exit
A more sophisticated way of setting a profit limit order is
to look for an area of nearby price resistance(if long) or price
support (if short) such that if price were to reach that area
it would likely attract the wrong kind of crowd (sellers
pouncing at resistance or buyers gathering shares at sup-
port). Price support or resistance can come in the form of
a major moving average, an area of previous price reversal,
or a trendline. Traders familiar with Bollinger Bands or
other forms of standard deviation envelopes can also use
those tools to set price pattern stops. This is a more rea-
sonable way to approach profit limits, and it takes advan-
tage of your chart-reading skills.
Average True Range Profit Exit
A third way to calculate your exit target is to use an aver-
age true range profit exit. To calculate this, simply multiply
your ATR by 3, assuming you set your stop at 2*ATR. So
say, for example, you are trading RIMM long, which is cur-
rently being offered at 96.82 with an ATR of 3.25. If your
entry price was 96.00, say, you would then set your stop-
(cid:2) (cid:4)
loss at 96.00 (2 3.25), or 89.50, and your target limit
(cid:1) (cid:4)
order at 96.00 (3 3.25), or 105.75.

==================================================

ENTRIES AND EXITS 237
Trailing Stop Profit Exit
The fourth and final way to bank your profits, and the way
I normally use, is simply to take your stop-loss and move it
in response to any positive movement in your position (up
for longs, down for shorts) on a closing basis. This is called
a trailing stop exit, and studies show it is by far the most
profitable. Why is this? Because it follows the age-old
trader’s dictum: “Let your winners run.” Setting specific
profit targets is often the favored choice for trend trading
because it keeps your turnover of trades flowing smoothly.
It is the right choice if you need your trading account to
produce a steady cash flow in order to pay your bills. The
problem with using profit targets, however, is that you then
miss out on those few big runs that, in themselves, can be
all the fuel you need to get your account into the big
leagues. In fact, you can take losses in the majority of your
trades, but if you cut them short and let your winners run,
those two or three huge winners you are bound to get each
year can keep you at the trading game a long, long time.
Read the Market Wizards stories: nearly every trader
there looks back on one or two huge winners that propelled
them from amateur wannabes into the professional trading
arena. So if you are not sure where to place a profit target,
or you think your position could be the next Google, hold
on to it for a while with a trailing stop-loss and let the mar-
ket take you out of the trade.
REAL-TIME TRADING

to know to execute profitable trend trades. What is not

here, and indeed cannot be here, is perhaps the most
important part of trend trading: real-time experience.
There is no substitute for the countless hours it will take
to put this knowledge into practice in a way that will lead
you to find technically sound trading setups, make consis-
tently profitable trades, take reasonably small losses, and
ultimately ramp up your trading account to new highs. To
put into practice what you have learned in this chapter, I
suggest you take the following action steps:
1. Read this chapter at least twice. We all read through
our prejudices, and these may cause you to overlook
important bits of information. Go back over this
material to be sure to catch items you may have
missed on the first reading.
2. Spend several trading days just eyeballing your watch
lists. There is no substitute for putting in hours of
chart reading for the setups we teach in this book.
You will need to so internalize these setups that
they become second nature to you. You need to
gain that intuitive sense for stocks that look
somewhat like a particular setup but have other
issues going on that likely would weigh against the
setup, and that intuitive sense for a setup that is just
so outrageously perfect that you can hardly wait to
enter your position the next day.
3. Give serious thought to position sizing. This could
constitute an entire chapter by itself, but instead of
boring you with my theories let me suggest that you
read Chapter 12 of Van Tharp’s book Trade Your

Way to Financial Freedom. Short of that, I always
recommend that my students divide their accounts
into equal monetary amounts and put no more than
that amount into each trade. When you are first
starting out as a trend trader, you should go very
lightly into your trades (dividing by 10 ought to
work). You can increase your size as you gain
more experience. It is also not a bad idea to scale
back on size during a losing streak and increase
in size during a winning streak. That may seem
counterintuitive, but in the game of trading, losing
tends to beget more losing and winning tends to
beget more winning.

L
ET’Slook at another form of trend trading using a dif-
ferent asset class: stock options. Options will add a great
deal of flexibility to your trend trading. Don’t like the risk
in a certain setup, but you really like the chart? Trade the
options instead. Don’t have much cash on hand, but you
want to get in on a predicted move in Google (currently
trading well over $500 per share)? Buy the options for a lot
less. Do you have a large amount of profit in your open
positions, and you fear the markets are about to reverse?
Add some price insurance—with options. Want to profit
from the huge moves that take place during earnings sea-
son but don’t want to risk being on the wrong side? You can
do that too—with (you guessed it!) options. So, you may
be asking, what the heck are options?
WHAT ARE OPTIONS?
Options are traded just like stocks. You can either buy them
in the hope that they will rise in price or sell them short
(this is also called writing an option) in the hope that they

will fall in price. There are only two kinds of stock options:
calls and puts. Call options tend to rise in price as the stock
price rises. Put options tend to rise in price as the stock
price falls. So both the buyer of a call option and the writer
of a put option, generally, are bullish on the stock. And
both the writer of a call option and the buyer of a put
option, generally, are bearish on the stock.
Option buyers have rights, and option writers have
obligations. Option buyers have the right, but not the obli-
gation, to buy (if a call is bought) or sell (if a put is bought)
the underlying stock at a specified price. This right remains
in place until the option expires. Each option contract you
purchase will have a specified expiration month associated
with it. Options expire on the third Friday of their expira-
tion month. Option writers have the obligation to sell (if a
call is sold short) or buy (if a put is sold short) the under-
lying stock at a specified price. This obligation remains in
place until the option expires.
There are no margin requirements if you want to pur-
chase an option because your risk is limited to the price of
the option. An option purchase requires the account to be
debited in the amount of the option’s purchase price, or pre-
mium. Option writers, on the other hand, receive a credit
to their account in the amount of the option’s premium for
selling that option. They get to keep this amount if the
option expires worthless on its expiration date. However,
since option sellers also have an obligation to buy (put) or
sell (call) the underlying stock if their option is exercised
by the person they sold their option to (the assigned option
holder), they assume a risk greater than the amount of the

price of the option. Therefore, writing an option always
requires the use of a margin account. Not all brokers allow
for the writing or selling of options unless the writer or
seller also owns shares of the underlying stock.
STOCK OPTIONS TERMINOLOGY
To trade options, you must be acquainted with the termi-
nology of the options market. I’ve provided here a list of
the most commonly used terms associated with buying and
selling stock options.
At-the-Money
An option is at-the-money if the market price of the under-
lying interest is at or near the underlying stock price.
Generally, at-the-money options cost more than out-
of-the-money options.
Buy to Close
Buying to close is when you buy a contract that you are
currently short.
Buy to Open
Buying to open a position is when you buy a contract that
you don’t already own.
Call Option
A call option is a contract that gives the holder the right to
buy the underlying for the strike price anytime until expiry.

==================================================

246 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
Delta
There are several Greek letter symbols used in options ter-
minology that refer to changes in an option’s premium.
The most important of these for our purposes is delta.
Delta refers to a ratio between option premium and
stock price. This relationship is not normally a 1:1 ratio.
Most often it is around 0.5:1 (and often less than that). In
other words, if the delta for an option is 0.5, then for every
$1 move in the stock, there is a corresponding $0.50 move
in the option premium. That may make it seem like options
are not as good a deal as stocks, but the fact that options
are leveraged by price—it takes a lot less money to control
100 shares buying the options rather than the shares—
makes them very attractive despite the delta ratio.
There is some good news regarding delta: it changes
as the stock price moves more and more in-the-money.
Usually, at the strike price delta is around 0.5. Deep in-the-
money options, however, can move at closer to a 1:1 ratio.
The opposite is true as well: if the stock moves away from
the strike price and out of the money, delta tends to de-
crease. This factor alone—the delta factor—makes options
very attractive for trend trading: as a position moves in our
favor, our options increase in value at a faster and faster
rate, but as a position moves against us, they decrease in
value at a slower and slower rate.
Exercise Style
• American Style: American-style options can be
exercised anytime until expiry.
• European Style: European-style options can be
exercised only on expiry (not before).

==================================================

OPTIONS BASICS 247
Exercise and Assignment
Exerciseis when the option holder decides to use the option
to buy or sell the underlying stock at the strike price.
Assignmentis when an option seller (called the writer of an
option) is required to buy or sell the underlying stock due
to the obligation from writing the option. An option holder
exercising an option will cause an option writer to be
assigned.
Expiration Date
A stock option expires by the market’s close on the third
Friday of the expiration month. All listed options have
options available for the current month and the next
month as well as specific future months. Each stock has a
corresponding cycle of months that they offer options in.
There are three fixed expiration cycles available. They are
as follows:
1. January, April, July, and October
2. February, May, August, and November
3. March, June, September, and December
The date the option expires is referred to as the expiration
date.
Holder
The holder is the person who bought an option contract.
People who buy an option they previously wrote are not
holders, they are just closing an existing position. Option
holders are said to be long the option they bought.

In-the-Money
• Call options: The underlying stock price is above
the option strike price.
• Put options: The underlying stock price is below
the option strike price.
• Note: All options with intrinsic value are in-the-
money.
Generally, in-the-money options cost more to pur-
chase than at-the-money options.
Intrinsic Value
Intrinsic value is the portion of an options premium that is
attributed to the value that could currently be realized by
exercising and simultaneously closing out the position in
the open market.
Long
If you own a security or stock option, you are said to be
long that security or option.
Out-of-the-Money
• Call options: The underlying stock price is below
the option strike price.
• Put options: The underlying stock price is above
the option strike price.
Premium
A premium is the price that is paid for an option contract.
An option’s premium is determined by a number of
factors including, but not limited to, the current price of



==================================================
                     PAGE 268

OPTIONS BASICS 249
the underlying asset, the strike price of the option, the time
remaining until expiration (time value), and the volatility
of the stock. An option premium is priced on a per-share
basis. Each option on a stock corresponds to 100 shares.
Therefore, if the premium of an option is priced at 2.50,
the total cost for that option would be $250 per contract
(cid:4)
(2.50 premium 100 shares per contract). Buying an
option creates a debit in the amount of the option’s total
cost to the buyer’s trading account. Writing or selling short
an option creates a credit in the amount of the option’s total
cost to the seller’s trading account.
Put Option
A put option is a contract that gives the holder the right to
sell the underlying for the strike price anytime until expiry.
Sell to Close
Selling to close is selling a contract you currently own.
Short
If you sell a security or stock option you didn’t already
own, you are said to be short that security or option.
Time Value
The time remaining until expiration of a purchased option
has a monetary value in options trading. This value is called
the option’s time value. Time value increases the further
away from expiration the option is, and it decreases as the
option moves closer to expiration. The rate of this decrease
changes exponentially over time, so as an option moves
closer and closer to expiration, the option’s time value

decreases at a faster and faster rate. On the day of expira-
tion, options possess no time value whatsoever.
Strike Price (Exercise Price)
The strike price is the price that the underlying asset will
be bought or sold at if an option contract is exercised.
Options are available in several strike prices above and
below the current price of the underlying asset. Stocks
priced below $25 per share usually have strike prices at
intervals of $2.50. Stocks priced over $25 usually have
strike prices at $5 intervals.
Underlying
The underlying is something that an option contract is
based on. This could be a stock, an index, a foreign cur-
rency, an interest rate, or a futures contract. The underly-
ing is commonly referred to as the underlying interest,
underlying asset, underlying security, or underlying stock.
Writer
A writer is someone who sold an option contract to open a
position. The writer is the person who is taking on the risk
(underwriting the risk). People who sell an options con-
tract they already own are not writers, they are just clos-
ing an existing position. Option writers are said to be short
the option they wrote.
Write (Sell to Open)
Selling to open is selling short an options contract that you
don’t already own. The writer is the person taking on the
risk (underwriting the risk). People who sell an options

contract they already own are not writers, they are just

SUMMARY OF
HOW OPTIONS WORK
• Stock options give you the right to buy or sell an
underlying stock.
• If you buy an option, you are not obligated to buy
or sell the underlying stock; you simply have the
right to do so.
• If you sell an option and the option is exercised,
you are obligated to deliver the underlying
stock (if you bought a call) or take delivery
of the underlying stock (if you bought a put)
at the strike price of the option, regardless of
the current price of the underlying stock.
• Options are good for a specified period of time,
after which they expire and you lose your right to
buy or sell the underlying instrument at the
specified price.
• Options when bought are done so at a debit to the
buyer.
• Options when sold are done so by giving a credit
to the seller.
• Options are available in several strike prices
representing the price of the underlying
instrument.
• The cost of an option is referred to as the option
premium. The price reflects a variety of factors

==================================================

including the current price of the underlying
stock, the strike price of the option, the time
remaining until expiration, and volatility.
• Options are not available on every stock. There
are approximately 2,200 stocks with tradable
options. Each stock option represents 100 shares
of a company’s stock.
ADVANTAGES OF OPTIONS
Options are the most versatile trading instruments avail-
able. They can, for example, be traded on a wide variety of
instruments, including stocks, stock indexes, exchange-
traded funds (like the QQQQ), commodities, currencies,
and bonds. Options on all these instruments function in
exactly the same way as described previously. Our focus
here, however, will be on stock options.
Options are also versatile because they can be used for
a larger variety of reasons than simple stocks.
• Options are used to hedge against risk.
If you have 1,000 shares of IBM, for example, and suspect
that the stock might be in for a drawdown, you can buy 10
put options (or sell 10 calls), which would increase in value
in that event. Once the sell-off was over, you could then
sell the puts for a profit against the loss suffered in the
stock. The effect is twofold: you are partially protected
against a loss in the stock, and the profit from the option
sale serves to lower the entry cost of the IBM stock.



==================================================
                     PAGE 272                     
==================================================

OPTIONS BASICS 253
• Options can also be used to profit from periods when
the markets are volatile and unpredictable.
There are certain market-neutral strategies using options
that take advantage of the fact that options tend to gain in
value at an increasing rate as a stock moves favorably, but
decrease in value at a decreasing rate as a stock moves unfa-
vorably. This is the aforementioned delta factor of an
option, and it can yield incredibly consistent gains if played
wisely. If, for example, one expects RIMM to move wildly
on its earnings announcement, but you are not sure
whether that move will be up or down, you can purchase
both a call and a put on RIMM. If on the day of the
announcement RIMM trades up strongly, you can sell the
put for a loss and hold the call for the gain. Because of
the delta factor, the put should decrease in value at a rate
slower than the increase in value of the call option. This is
a profitable variance that can be exploited again and again,
particularly during earnings season. We will teach you how
to implement this strategy later.
• Options give the smaller account trader an incredible
amount of leverage with which to play higher-priced
stocks.
By buying a call or put instead of the actual stock, a trader
with only a couple thousand dollars to trade can still con-
trol round lots of the stock instead of having to purchase
odd lots (less than 100 shares). He or she can take full posi-
tions in some of the higher-priced stocks, the big movers,

when normally the smaller trading capital would have pro-
hibited it. With options, a smaller account trader can take
multiple positions without tying up all his or her cash.
But the primary advantage of stock options versus
simple stocks is leverage. Leverage is here defined as the
advantage gained by the investor who can make a small
amount of money do the work of a much larger amount. In
stock options, you can frequently put yourself in a situa-
tion where every $1 invested in options is doing work
equivalent to $10 or more invested in stocks.
Let’s give a real-world example. Let’s say I wanted to
buy 500 shares of EBAY because I think it is going to go
up over the next few weeks. Currently EBAY is trading at
about $40 per share. So those 500 shares of EBAY are
going to cost me $20,000. Let’s also say that I am right:
over the next month, EBAY goes to $50. My 500 shares are
(cid:1)
now worth $25,000. I have made a profit of: $5,000, or 25
percent on my original investment, less commissions. Here
is a summary of my stock trade:
• Buy 500 shares EBAY @ $40: cost $20,000
(cid:1)
• Stock goes to $50: profit $5,000, or 25 percent
Anytime you can bank a 25 percent gain in a month, you’ve
made a nice trade.
But now let’s say, instead of buying the stock outright,
I purchased call options on the stock instead. If EBAY is
trading at $40, and I think it is going to go up, I would
want to buy calls at the 40 strike at least two months out
(to give my trade time to mature). Currently the premium

on these options is about 4.00, or a cost of $400 per con-
tract. I’m going to buy five contracts at a cost of $2,000.
Again, I’m right, and EBAY rockets to $50. At a delta of
0.5, which then increases to about 0.7 as the calls move
from being at-the-money to being in-the-money, the pre-
mium on my calls increases from 4.00 to about 10.00.
Those five options are now worth $5,000. I have made a
profit of $3,000 less commissions. While this is less than
the profit made with the stock purchase, it represents an
(cid:1)
overall gain of an astonishing 150 percent. To put this
into perspective: if I had put the same amount of money
into the options as I had put into the stock ($20,000), I
could have bought 50 calls. Those 50 calls would have
risen to a premium value of $50,000, or a net profit of
$30,000 versus the $5,000 I made trading the stock. That’s
600 percent leverage. That’s what I’m talking about with
options. Leverage, baby, leverage!
So to summarize:
(cid:5)
• Buy 5 EBAY 40 calls @ $400: total cost $2,000
(cid:5) (cid:1)
• Stock goes to $50: profit $3,000, or 150
percent
But what happens if EBAY does not move in my
expected direction? If instead of shooting up $10, it drops
$10? What happens to my investment then? Well, if I had
simply bought 500 shares of the stock, I would be down
$5,000. My $20,000 investment would now be worth only
$15,000, for a loss of 25 percent. But if I had bought five
call contracts instead of the stock, I would also be down,

==================================================

256 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
but not as much. Again, delta works in our favor in the
event of a loss. As EBAY’s stock price moves against us, and
our options go further and further out-of-the-money, the
rate of decrease in the premium value slows down. I will
lose some time value during the days of EBAY’s sell-off,
but the overall amount of loss in premium tends to decrease
relative to the loss in the underlying stock. This means that
buying the options provides less risk than owning the stock.
For example:
(cid:5)
• EBAY goes from $40 to $30 $5,000 loss on
stock trade.
(cid:5)
• But: My call options go from 4.00 to 2.00
$1,000 loss on the options trade (compare this
to a $3,000 gain if the stock makes the same
10-point move to the upside).
• So: The options risk/reward ratio is 3.0 times greater
than the stock purchase, thanks to the power of delta.
There are several other advantages to the purchase of
stock options versus the purchase of the underlying stock.
For one, there is no uptick rule when you want to profit
from a stock’s sell-off. If you short a stock, normally you
must wait for a bid uptick before you can enter the posi-
tion. Not so with options. You simply buy the put at the
offer price. There is no need for an uptick.
With puts, there are no dividends and margin inter-
est to pay. If you short the stock, however, you will be
charged interest on 50 percent of your investment (margin
fee), and you will also be charged for any payable dividend
if there is one.

OPTIONS BASICS 257
DISADVANTAGES OF OPTIONS
There are some disadvantages with options that should be
pointed out, before anyone thinks they have found the ideal
trading vehicle.
• Time value decay: Options lose value as they
approach expiration, and there is nothing you can
do to stop it.
• The rate of time value decay increases over time: the
closer the option gets to expiration, the faster the
decay-see Figure 12.1.
• Full loss of investment: If the trade goes against you
and you hold the option to expiration (which we
caution strongly against in any case), your option
will expire worthless.
• Thismeansyouwillhavetoreduceyourper-trade
investmentsize,thusreducingyouroverallgains.
• It also makes compounding gains more difficult,
since 100 percent compounding can lead to
irreparable damage if you take a large loss.
• With options there is no pre- or postmarket trading
available: if you see bad news come out overnight
and you own calls, there is nothing you can do
about it until the next trading day.
• There is normally less liquidity in options than in
stocks: Some out-of-the-money options do not
trade every day.
• In general, the more liquid a stock is, and the
closer to being at-the-money the option strike
is, the more liquid the option will be.

==================================================

258 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• There are larger spreads between bid and ask.
• In well-traded stocks, the spread on the stock
option is usually 0.10 to 0.20.
• In less liquid stocks, the spread can be 0.40
or more.
• Options cannot be traded in some IRAs.
• Some IRAs restrict options trading to purchase
only and forbid the writing of options.
Figure 12.1 is a clear, visual example of the exponen-
tial increase in the rate of time value decay as an option
approaches its maturity at expiration. This fact increases the
risk value ofoptions as they are held over time: ifthe under-
lying stock does not move in a favorable direction within a
Figure 12.1 Time decay curve.

short period of time following the option’s purchase, the
chances of that option becoming profitable decrease; the
longer the delay, the less likely the chance for profit.
BASIC OPTIONS PARAMETERS
Option contracts possess four identifiers: the underlying,
the expiration month, the strike price, and the type.
(cid:5)
• The underlying what market the option
represents (stock, index, etc.)
(cid:5)
• Expiration date the third Friday of the month in
which the option expires
(cid:5)
• Strike price the price at which the option owner
has the right (not the obligation) to purchase the
underlying
Options are classified as being in-the-money(ITM), at-the-
money (ATM), or out-of-the-money (OTM).
(cid:5)
• ITM the call strike price is less than the
underlying price; the put strike price is greater
than the underlying price.
(cid:5)
• ATM the call/put strike price is the same as
the underlying price.
(cid:5)
• OTM the call strike price is greater than the
underlying price; the put strike price is less than
the underlying price.
(cid:5)
Type calls or puts. There are only two types of options:
calls and puts (see Figures 12.2 and 12.3).

==================================================

OPTIONS BASICS 261
• A call option gives the option buyer the right,
but not the obligation, to purchase the
underlying market (100 shares per option
contract on stock) at a specified price (the strike
price) at any time between option purchase and
option expiration.
• Calls bought make money as the market goes
up.
• Calls sold or written make money as the market
goes down or stays flat.
• A put option gives the option buyer the right, but
not the obligation, to sell the underlying market
(100 shares per option contract on stock) at a
specified price (the strike price) at any time
between now and option expiration.
• Puts bought make money as the market goes
down.
• Puts sold or written make money as the market
goes down or stays flat.
Options have two kinds of value, which combine to make
the premium you must pay to own them:
• Intrinsic value (IV) is a function of a variety of
factors including the price of the underlying; IV
increases as the option moves further in-the-
money; IV becomes 0 once an option is out-of-
the-money.
• Time value (TV) decreases as the option moves
closer to expiration; TV becomes 0 at expiration.

DR. STOXX’S RULES FOR TRADING
STOCK OPTIONS
In this section I am going to outline the basic rules I use
for trading options on our Befriend the Trend Trading
trend trade picks. Many of our newsletter subscribers use
options on our picks with truly incredible results. Some
use options exclusively and so do not trade those picks
whose options do not meet the criteria outlined here. Oth-
ers use options when the price of the underlying stock is
too high for their accounts. Either way, you will learn

OPTIONS BASICS 263
here how to trend-trade stock options with the least
amount of risk.
If you are already a successful trend trader, then you
will have no problem at all becoming a successful options
trader. Simply follow the rules as I’ve outlined them here.
Remember, these rules are not optional. If you want long-
term trading success with options, you must follow these
rules to the letter. You have no choice. Due to their lever-
age, you cannot trade options in the same way you trade
stocks.Itmayworkintheshortterm,butlongerterm,you
willwipeoutyouraccount.Pleasedonotskipthissection.
Read these rules carefully, write up a brief summary of
theminyourownwords,andpostthemnexttoyourtrad-
ing computer.
1. Never buy options with less than one month to expiration
unless they are to be used for day trading.
• In this way you avoid the worst period for time
value decay and thus take some of the risk out of
your trade.
2. Avoid options on stocks that trade fewer than 1 million
shares per day.
• Options are much less liquid than stocks, so we
can increase our chances of getting a decent fill,
and of a reliable exit, if we trade options only on
the most liquid of stocks.
3. Avoid options with spreads larger than 10 percent (e.g.,
0.2 on 2.00 option).
• The spread is the difference between the asking
price and the bid price; it is a premium you have



==================================================
                     PAGE 283                     
==================================================

264 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
to pay to the exchange’s market makers in order
to put on the trade.
• The greater the spread, the more the underly-
ing stock has to move to get you to a break-
even point; the more the stock has to move, the
greater your risk in the trade.
• A rule of thumb I like to follow is this: if a
spread is greater than 0.10, I usually enter a
limit order between the spread; if the spread is
greater than 0.30, I usually avoid trading that
option. Yes, I miss out on some great trades
doing this, but that’s just me. I hate to pay
premium for anything (just ask my wife!).
• Some options that are heavily traded (such as
options on the QQQQ) have spreads as narrow
as 0.05. New rules have recently come into effect
that allow options exchanges to offer spreads in
0.01 increments. This should serve options trad-
ers well, as they will then have greater pricing
control, and thus narrower spreads.
4. On short-term plays (less than two weeks), buy the next
month’s strike (paying attention to rule #1).
• For example, if today is July 6 and I want to buy
EBAY calls because I think EBAY is likely to go
up in price within the next one to two weeks, I
would not buy the July options, since we are less
than one month from July’s expiration date, but
would instead buy the next month out.
5. On longer-term plays (more than two weeks), buy the
strike at least two months out.



==================================================
                     PAGE 284                     
==================================================

OPTIONS BASICS 265
• For example, if today is July 6 and I want to
buy EBAY calls because I think EBAY is likely
to go up in price within the next three to four
weeks, I would not buy the next month out,
since four weeks would put us in the worst
phase of those options’ time value decay curve.
Instead, I would buy the next expiration out
after that, which for EBAY means the
October calls.
6. Buy the closest in-the-money or at-the-money strike.
• For example, if GE is trading at 27.00, you
would buy the 27.50 strike (puts or calls), but if
GE is trading at 26.00, you would buy the 25.00
strike (puts or calls).
• Note: In general (assuming you trade a winning
system) . . .
• Trading far OTM options have a lower winning
percentage but a higher-percentage return if the
trade is successful (lower premiums paid but a
bigger move in the stock is needed to make a
profit).
• Trading far ITM options have a higher winning
percentage but lower-percentage returns
(higher premiums paid but a smaller move in
the stock is needed to make a profit).
7. If you are only trading options, commit no more than
50 percent of your total account at any one time (keep at
least 50 percent reserve in cash), and spread this out over
at least five positions (roughly 10 percent of your total
account per trade).



==================================================
                     PAGE 285                     
==================================================

266 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
• Options are high risk. Anything less than this
kind of allotment runs the risk of wiping out a
significant portion of your account, and your
overall returns will suffer, if you are not forced
to close your account altogether. It will happen.
Even with the most robust of systems, losses
happen. And with options, this can mean a total
loss if you are not careful to pay attention to
position sizing.
• If you trade stocks and options together, as I
do, I suggest putting only 20 percent of your
total account into options and the remaining
80 percent of your capital to work in stocks.
8. Be quicker to take profits on options than on stocks
(because of time value decay).
• Losses can be held a bit longer since delta works
in your favor (delta slows down as the option
moves further OTM).
• Keep in mind that even a nice gain in an option
trade can disappear quickly if you hold on too
long, even if the stock does not move unfavor-
ably.
• At all times, respect the inevitability of time
value decay!
9. Determine a percentage stop price (25 to 40 percent
recommended) and set an audible alert near this price (or
set an alert on the underlying stock).
• Do not set an actual stop-loss on options; due to
their wider spread and lowered liquidity, a real



==================================================
                     PAGE 286                     
==================================================

OPTIONS BASICS 267
stop-loss on an option trade is not recom-
mended.
10. Set a limit sell order at your target based on an estimated
(cid:4)
move in the underlying delta.
For example, say KLAC is trading in early July
around $50 and you expect the stock to move to 55:
• So you buy KLAC Sept 50 calls @ 5.00 (delta
0.50).
• As soon as you are executed, you should set a
limit sell order, good till canceled (GTC), at
(cid:4)
7.50 ($5 move 0.50; 50 percent gain).
(cid:2)
11. Never take more than a 40 percent loss on any options
(cid:2)
position or 5 percent of your total account, whichever is
smaller.
• This rule holds only for the single positions, not
the compound positions, which require the use
of more than one option at once. In the com-
pound positions, your potential loss is generally
(cid:2)
limited and is usually nowhere near 40 percent.
• A 5 percent loss guarantees that you will be able
to put on at least 20 options trades before you
run out of money. If you can’t turn a decent
profit with 20 options trades, then you should
be out of the game altogether.
12. Once an option position has a profit of 50 percent, close
the position if it trades down to breakeven.
• There is an old adage said about options: Profits
once lost rarely return. If you have a decent return



==================================================
                     PAGE 287                     
==================================================

268 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
in your options position and it suddenly fizzles
back to your entry price, it is probably a good
idea to close the position at breakeven to avoid a
loss. Due to a variety of pricing factors, and un-
like the tragic Sisyphus, options have a harder
time climbing the hill the second time around.
13. Hold all compound option positions (covered calls, bull and
bear spreads) to expiration.
• The one exception to this rule is for the straddle,
which you will learn about in Chapter 13.
14. If you are profitable in a single option position (calls, puts,
naked calls and puts), close the position two weeks before
expiration and, if you want to remain in the position, buy
the next month’s position at the nearest ITM strike.
• This is called rolling over your position; if you
reinvest your profits by buying a larger position
in the new option, you are pyramiding your
position. Both are good ideas as long as your
position is nicely profitable. This is how you can
get ten-baggers and more from options.
Okay, those are my must-follow rules for swing trad-
ing stock options. Remember, if you are going to buy or
write a stock options contract, you must have a reasonable
degree of confidence in the future direction of the under-
lying stock, just as you would if you were to buy or sell
short the stock itself. For this you need a sound trading
strategy. And if you employ a market-neutral approach to
an options position, you need to be reasonably sure that the

stock is about to make a sizeable move, one way or the
other. For this, again, you need a sound trading strategy.
One final note, and it is an important one: you can be
a successful stock options trader only if you are already a
successful stock trader. It is strongly recommended that
you nottrade options until you have a proven track record
of strong stock-trading gains. You can go a long time los-
ing at the stock-trading game and still maintain enough
capital to mount a comeback once you’ve gained the nec-
essary experience. However, the highly leveraged nature of
options ensures that losing at the stock options game is a
short-lived experience.

I
T bears repeating that you need to know, before you
enter any options position, whether you are bullish, bear-
ish, or neutral on the underlying stock, and to what degree
you are so. Options trading also requires you to assess your
risk tolerance so that you can select the appropriate option
combination to either increase or reduce your risk expo-
sure.
With this in mind, the following list of options-
trading strategies is offered for your consideration. The list
is set up to allow you to choose the best options strategy
based on:
• Your directional bias on the underlying stock
• Your risk tolerance for the particular trade
Directional bias here means in which direction you see the
stock moving as it trades into the near future. And risk tol-
erance refers to your confidence level regarding the trade:
if it is high, you might want to assume unlimited risk (with
unlimited upside potential) and use a stop-loss; if it is not

very high, you might want to assume limited risk (which
usually goes along with limited upside potential). Once you
have decided these two elements, you are ready to select
the appropriate options-trading strategy for the stock you
wish to profit from.
So the first question to ask yourself is: “What is my
outlook on the stock I want to trade?”
• Bullish: I expect a significant price rise.
• Bearish: I expect a significant price fall.
•Neutral: I expect a move up or down but am not
sure which.
• Volatile: I expect a strong move up or down.
BULLISH STRATEGIES
Let’s assume you are bullish on your stock. You have now
satisfied your directional bias question. Next thing you
need to do is determine your risk tolerance, or more pre-
cisely, how confident you are that your stock is going up by
a significant amount.
So you now need to ask yourself, “Just how bullish am
I on this stock?”
• Very bullish: Requires a higher-risk strategy.
• Moderately bullish: Requires a more conservative
strategy.
Now it is time to lay out our strategies for these var-
ious scenarios.

==================================================

OPTIONS STRATEGIES: BULLISH TRENDS 273
VERY BULLISH
Strategy 1: Buy Calls
Strategy rationale: The investor thinks that the stock
will rise significantly in the short term.
Strategy implementation: Call options are bought at
the nearest ITM strike price.
Upside potential: The profit potential is unlimited
and rises as the stock price rises.
Break-even point at expiry: Strike price plus the
spread and commission.
Downside risk: Limited to the premium paid-
incurred if the stock at expiry is at, or below,
the strike price.
Margin: Not required.
Comment: If the market does little, then the value of
the position will decrease as the option time
value falls.
Strategy 2: Sell Naked Put
Strategy rationale: The investor is bullish on the
stock and quite certain the stock will not
decline over time.
Strategy implementation: Put options are sold or
written at the nearest ATM or ITM strike
without also holding a short position in the
stock (hence, a naked put). If an investor is very
bullish, then deeper ITM puts would be sold
or written.



==================================================
                     PAGE 293                     
==================================================

274 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
Upside potential: Profit potential is limited to the
premium received. The more the option is
ITM at purchase, the greater the premium
received.
Break-even point at expiry: Strike price less the
spread.
Downside risk: Loss is almost unlimited (“almost,”
since the underlying price cannot fall below
zero). This is a high-risk strategy, although
stops can be used to limit that risk. There is
the potential for a catastrophic loss if the stock
crashes overnight due to bad news.
Margin: Always required.
Comment: If the stock does little, and time passes,
the position is likely to become profitable as
time value in the option erodes.
MODERATELY BULLISH
Strategy 1: Bull Call or Put Spread
Strategy rationale: The investor thinks that the
stock price will rise modestly and not fall,
but wants to limit the downside risk just in
case.
Strategy implementation: A call option is bought at
the nearest ITM strike price, and another call
option is sold or written at the nearest OTM
strike price; this produces a debit to the
account.

==================================================

OPTIONS STRATEGIES: BULLISH TRENDS 275
OR
A put option is bought at the nearest ITM strike
price, and another put option is sold or written
at the nearest OTM strike price; this produces
a credit to the account.
Upside potential (in the case of a bull call spread):
Limited to the difference between the two
strikes (normally $500 per contract) less the
initial debit; maximum profit is gained if the
stock at expiry is above the higher strike.
OR
(In the case of a bull put spread): Limited to the
initial credit; maximum profit is gained if the
stock at expiry is above the higher strike.
Downside risk (in the case of a bull call spread):
Limited only to the net initial debit; maximum
loss is seen if at expiry the stock price is below
the lower strike.
OR
(In the case of a bull put spread): Limited only to
the difference between the two strikes less
the initial credit; maximum loss is seen if at
expiry the stock price is below the lower
strike.
Margin: Required only on the calls sold or written.
Comment: Time value erosion is not too significant a

==================================================

factor in this strategy due to the balanced
position.
Strategy 2: Covered Calls
Strategy rationale: The investor thinks that the stock
price will rise modestly over time but is
worried about a possible drawdown first and
wants to limit the downside risk.
Strategy implementation: The investor buys the
underlying stock (hence, covered call as opposed
to naked call where one does not own the stock)
and sells or writes a call (1 per 100 shares
owned) against the stock at the nearest OTM
strike price.
Upside potential: Limited to the difference between
the purchase price of the stock and the strike
price, plus the credit for the call sold.
Downside risk: Limited to the drop of the underlying
stock less the credit for the call sold.
Margin: Required only on the calls or puts sold or
written.
Comment: Time value erosion works in your favor in
this trade.

confident you are that your stock is going down by a sig-
nificant amount.

VERY BEARISH
Strategy 1: Buy Put
Strategy rationale: The investor thinks that the stock
will drop significantly in the short term.
Strategy implementation: Put options are bought at
the nearest ITM strike price.
Upside potential: Profit potential is unlimited and
rises as the stock price declines.
Break-even point at expiry: Strike price plus the
spread.
Downside risk: Limited to the premium paid—
incurred if the market at expiry is at, or above,
the strike price.
Margin: Not required.
Comment: If the stock does little, then the value of
the position will decrease as the option time
value falls.
Strategy 2: Sell Naked Call
Strategy rationale: The investor is bearish on the
stock and quite certain the stock will not
appreciate over time.
Strategy implementation: Call options are sold or
written at the nearest ATM or ITM strike
without also holding a long position in the
stock (hence, a naked call). If an investor is very
bearish on the stock, then deeper ITM calls
could be sold or written.

==================================================

OPTIONS STRATEGIES: BEARISH TRENDS 279
Upside potential: Profit potential is limited to the
premium received. The more the option is
ITM at purchase, the greater the premium
received.
Break-even point at expiry: Strike price less the
spread.
Downside risk: Loss is unlimited (since in theory the
price of a stock could rise to infinity). This is a
high-risk strategy, although certainly stops can
be used to limit that risk. There is the
potential for a catastrophic loss if the stock
gaps up overnight due to unexpected good
news.
Margin: Always required.
Comment: If the stock does little, and time passes,
the position is likely to become profitable as
time value in the option erodes.
MODERATELY BEARISH
Strategy 1: Bear Call or Put Spread
Strategy rationale: The investor thinks that the
stock price will rise modestly and not fall
but wants to limit the downside risk just in
case.
Strategy implementation: A call option is sold or
written at the nearest ITM strike price, and
another call option is bought at the nearest

OTM strike price; this produces a net credit to
the account.
OR
A put option is sold or written at the nearest ITM
strike price, and another put option is bought
at the nearest OTM strike price; this produces
a net debit to the account.
Upside potential (in the case of a bear call spread):
Limited to the initial net credit; maximum
profit is gained if the stock at expiry is below
the lower strike.

(In the case of a bear put spread): Limited to the
difference between the two strikes (usually
$500 per contract) minus the initial net debit;
maximum profit is gained if the stock at expiry
is above the higher strike.

maximum loss is seen if at expiry the stock
price is above the higher strike.

THE EARNINGS SEASON PLAY
In this section, I am going to introduce you to one of my
favorite options strategies, which can be used only at cer-
tain times of the year: the four earnings seasons. The timing
of earnings seasons will vary slightly from year to year as
different companies change their earnings dates over time.
For the most part, they follow the changes of the seasons.
Generally, whenever a new season begins—winter, spring,
summer, fall—we can look forward to a fresh batch of
earnings reports over the next four to five weeks.
With earnings reports comes a well-recognized phe-
nomenon: incredible market volatility. The options strat-
egy I will outline in this chapter—called the straddle, one
of the most mechanical of all options-trading strategies—
will show you how to capitalize on this volatility.
In its simplest form—straddle on, straddle off—we
(cid:1)
can expect returns from a straddle position in the 10 to
(cid:1)
20 percent range for a hold that can last anywhere from
two to five days. As long as you follow my rules to the let-
ter as listed here, you should expect about a 60 percent win
rate with this strategy. And because this is a compound

position (i.e., both long and short at the same time), the
losses when incurred are normally small. In its more com-
plex form—leg into the straddle, leg out of the straddle—
(cid:1)
returns can run to 50 percent or more in five to eight
trading days (legging inand legging outwill be defined later).
Both the simple and the complex forms are taught here. I
will first narrate the trading strategy, then I will offer a
more concise summary at the end of this chapter.
FINDING THE RIGHT STOCKS
What we are looking for when we put a straddle on a stock
during earnings season is an optionable, liquid, highly
volatile stock that is just about to report to the public its
quarterly earnings results, and which at past earnings
reports has fluctuated wildly in price. Whether the stock
tends to trade up or down following earnings does not mat-
ter; what matters is that it tends to move big one way or the
other. Three days before the report goes public, we are
going to put on (the simple version), or leg into (the com-
plex version), what is called a straddle. We will hold this
position for up to five days following the announcement (up
to seven days in all), during which time we will look to take
the position off, in most cases, for a nice profit.
First, let’s go over the search process step by step. A
successful straddle play requires a stock that satisfies the
following six criteria:
1. It is going to report its earnings three market days
from now.



==================================================
                     PAGE 304                     
==================================================

2. It is going to report its earnings after the market
close, on Monday through Thursday (normally no
company reports earnings on a Friday).
3. It is a volatile or high-beta stock.
4. It is a liquid stock (it has a large daily volume).
5. It is priced over $40 (the higher, the better).
6. It has a history of gapping up or down more than
$1.00 on the day after its earnings announcement.
The first step is to find a stock that is about to report
earnings. This is easily done with a free search of Yahoo!
Finance’s earnings calendar. You will find a link for this cal-
endar at http://biz.yahoo.com/r/. Look under “Company
Earnings” for the Earnings Dates link. Click on that link
and you will come to a page that lists, day by day, all the
companies that are reporting earnings for the current
week. You can also click ahead to the next week to see what
is coming up. When you do that, you should be looking at
a page that looks something like Table 15.1.
Alcoa is the company thought to usher in each new
earnings season, since it is listed first in any alphabetically
ordered list and thus is given a privileged position among
the companies announcing their earnings (one of those
funny Wall Street rituals). So once AA reports, it is time
to begin scanning the earnings announcement pages like
the one shown in Table 15.1. Early in the season you will
see about this number of companies reporting each day, 10
to 20. But the pace quickly picks up, and during the thick

of the season you will see numbers well over 100 report-

see several days without any companies reporting.
We want a stock that is going to report in three trad-
ing days. Assume that today is July 19. I will therefore be
looking for a stock that is set to report on July 22 after the
close. The reason we look only at those stocks that report
after the market closes is that the larger moves occur then,
as the news has a chance to be reported overnight to a

larger audience. It allows both evening traders and morn-
ing traders to have a chance to move the shares.
Here is part of the actual list of companies that were
set to publicly report their earnings on July 22, 2006. As
you can see from this partial list (only A through C com-
panies), we are now in the thick of the earnings season
(Table 15.2).
This is a long list (and we are only up to the C’s), but
we can soon whittle it down to a manageable number. First,
we eliminate all those stocks that report “before market
open.” We are not interested in those. We can also delete
those where “time [is] not supplied.” Most of those are
smaller companies we wouldn’t want to trade in any case.
So, after the first round of elimination, this is what we are
left with:
ARDI BHL CPKI PWN CBU
ADVS BORL ELY CATT CPSI
AMZN BFAM CBM CLS CPWR
ARTG BDN CMO COBZ CR
ABTL BRCM CPTV COHU CYT
Of the list that remains, we want to select only those
companies that trade at least 1 million shares each day and
are reasonably volatile (they trade up and down wildly at a
pace quicker than either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500). If
you are an active trader, as I am, and you work from a
watch list of stocks selected for their high volume and
volatility, as I do, you only need eyeball the preceding list
to recognize your favorite high-beta stocks to short-list.

This is the Key Statistics page from Yahoo! Finance, which
will give you a reading both of the average daily volume
and of beta, which, as mentioned, is a function of the
stock’s volatility relative to the S&P 500. Here, then, are
the rules for further elimination using this information:
• Eliminate all stocks with less than 1 million daily
shares traded.
• Eliminate all stocks with less than 2.0 beta.
• Eliminate all stocks priced less than 40.00.
This process of elimination has now whittled our list of
A—C stocks down to two: AMZN and BRCM. No sur-
prises there. To all active traders—at least at this writing—
these are very familiar symbols, and are nearly always on
the list of great trading vehicles.
The next thing we do with these two stocks is go to
the charts and ask this question: What have AMZN and
BRCM done in the previous two quarters at the announce-



==================================================

ment of earnings—are they overbought, oversold, or some-
where in between?
AMZN last reported earnings after the bell on April
22. In anticipation of the announcement, traders ran price
up to a short-term high, and they were right: the news was
(cid:1)
great. AMZN beat estimates by 21 percent! However, on
the day following the announcement, the market sold off
strongly overnight on the news (it’s another one of those
weird Wall Street rituals!), and the stock gapped down.
This signaled a buying opportunity to traders, who then
rallied the stock back up into resistance (see Figure 15.1).
That is exactly the kind of volatility that can turn a
straddle into an easy winner. This is just what we are look-
ing for when we go back to the previous two quarters’
announcements.
Two quarters ago, AMZN again showed great move-
Figure 15.1 AMZN showing earnings volatility.

                     PAGE 313

ment. The stock was overbought and near new 52-week
highs. Earnings came in cold, and the stock gapped down
sharply and then went into a tailspin for several weeks. Fig-
ure 15.2 is what the chart looked like.
Again, another easy winner for the straddle strategy.
Clearly, AMZN is going on our list of straddles to put on.
It satisfies all our criteria: it is optionable and highly liquid,
it has a high beta (is very volatile), and it goes absolutely
bonkers at earnings time.
Now, let’s take a quick look at BRCM. Like AMZN,
BRCM reported after the bell on April 22, 2004. In antic-
ipation, traders took a greatly oversold stock and ran it up
strongly (this is perfect for our legging-in strategy—see
later description). On the day of earnings, BRCM gapped
up strongly to continue the trend, then the shares met with
resistance. It came crashing back down again over the next
several days (see Figure 15.3).
Figure 15.2 AMZN showing earnings volatility.

==================================================

OPTIONS STRATEGIES: NEUTRAL 295
Figure 15.3 BRCM showing earnings volatility.
In the previous quarter, BRCM did something very
similar. It ran up into the earnings announcement, gapped
up hugely the day after the announcement was made, then
proceeded to sell off for several days after that (see Figure
15.4).
Now we will add both AMZN and BRCM to our list
of straddles to put on. They have satisfied all our entry
requirements, and both are great candidates for huge
returns during the week of July 19, as we straddle each
stock with a pair of options.
The next thing we want to know is this: where are
these stocks with respect to oversold or overbought levels
three days before earnings are announced? If we get a clear
oversold or overbought reading on that day, then we are
given a green light to leg into the straddle trade. If not,
then we will have to wait to put the straddle on into the
close of the day that earnings are to be reported. Both

Figure 15.4 BRCM showing earnings volatility.
AMZN and BRCM, as mentioned, are announcing after
the close on July 22. This means that we will check their
charts on July 19 to determine these levels.
We use the following technical indicators to tell us just
where these stocks are on the oversold-overbought spec-
trum:
• RSI (5) reading
• Less than 30 (oversold) or more than 70
(overbought)
• Stochastics %K (5) reading
• Less than 25 (oversold) or more than 75
(overbought)
• CCI (20) reading
(cid:2) (cid:1)
• Less than 100 (oversold) or more than 100
(overbought)

OPTIONS STRATEGIES: NEUTRAL 297
We need to see at least two out of three of these indi-
cators give oversold or overbought readings in order to get
a green light to leg into the trade. On July 10, BRCM had
(cid:2)
readings of 24.6, 6.24, and 140.5. AMZN had readings
(cid:2)
of 18.3, 23.17, and 108.4. Clearly, both stocks are in an
oversold condition. If these numbers were to hold until
July 19 (three days before each announces earnings), we
would then have given the green light to leg into these
straddles. Again, if we do not get a green light, we will not
leg into the trade. We will wait until the day of earnings to
put on both sides of the straddle.
Definition: Legging into an options straddle
occurs when we buy each side of the straddle—
the calls and the puts—on different market days.
Legging out ofan options straddle occurs when we
sell each side of the straddle on different market
days. The alternative is simply called putting on
the straddle: here both sides of the trade are
bought on the same market day, and usually at
the same time.
Legging in is the preferred mode of entry, since it has
the potential of maximizing our gains. But this is a more
complex form of the straddle and requires some market
timing. The simpler form of the straddle is to put the strad-
dle on during the day that earnings are to be announced.
This can be done in the morning or afternoon; it doesn’t
matter. In both cases, however, we will be legging out of
the trade. Just how these are all done will be explained later.

Keep in mind that a straddle is a market-neutral strat-
egy, meaning that we are not sure going into the trade in
which direction the stock is likely to go after we put the
position on. We just believe that the stock will move, and
move big, in response to its earnings announcement.
Whether it moves up or down makes no difference to us.
We will profit either way as long as the move is big enough.
The straddle is also, like the bull and bear spreads pre-
viously described, a compoundtrade. This means that we are
going to enter and exit more than one type of option. We
will, in fact, be buying both a call and a put. These may be
bought at separate times, which is what we mean by legging
into and legging out of the trade. Here is how we define the
straddle play.
MARKET NEUTRAL
Strategy: Straddle
Strategy rationale: The investor thinks that the stock
will be very volatile in the short term but does
not know which way the stock will move.
Strategy implementation: The call option and the put
option are bought at the same ATM strike
price; if the stock price is between two strikes,
then the call and the put are each bought at the
nearest strike.
Upside potential: Unlimited.
Break-even point at expiry: This trade is never held to

expiration; the trade always remains at or near
breakeven less spread and time value decay
Downside risk: Limited to the two premiums paid.
Margin: Not required.
Comment: The position loses value with the passage
of time as the time value decreases on options.
PUTTING ON THE STRADDLE
Now we are ready to put the trade on. We have two options
here: either we leg into the trade, meaning that we will buy
the two sides of the position on different days, or we will
simply put the trade on by buying both sides together.
We are given a green light to leg into the trade when
the stock is either oversold or overbought three days before
the earnings announcement. Here are the rules for legging
into the trade:
Three days before earnings, check the chart.
• If oversold, buy the call options at the close of
that day, and on the day of the earnings an-
nouncement, buy the puts at the close.
• If overbought, buy the put options at the close
of that day, and on the day of the earnings an-
nouncement, buy the calls at the close.
That is how we leg into the trade. Of course, you can tin-
ker a bit with the “buy at the close” idea. If you are going
to leg into the calls, for example, and the market is strong
in the morning, you might want to buy them earlier in the

==================================================

day rather than only at the end. But the simplest entry is to
buy them just a few minutes before the market closes at
4 p.m. EST. Keep in mind that options do not trade in
after-hours trading (at least not yet—in the future they
likely will).
Legging into the straddle position is a strategy aimed
at maximizing the potential return of one side of the trade
prior to the big move. The theory here is that in an over-
sold or overbought market, traders will move the stock in
the opposite direction a few days before the announcement
in anticipation of a contrary move after the announcement.
The other mode of entry is less complex. If we do not
get a green light to leg into the trade, we will simply buy
both sides of the trade, both call and put options, sometime
before the close on the day of the announcement.
Here is an important note: we want to buy the same
strike price for each side of the trade, and it should be the
nearest strike possible. Choosing an expiration month will
follow the same rules for all options trades as listed previ-
ously.
TAKING OFF A STRADDLE
We have selected our stocks to straddle and have entered
both sides of the trade: calls and puts. Now we need to
know how long to hold both. Here is how we do this.
We expect a large move to occur in the stock over-
night as the numbers are announced and speculators pile
on orders in the after-market trading period. By 9:30 a.m.
EST, when the market opens the next day, we should see a
sizeable gap in price relative to the previous day’s close. If

==================================================

OPTIONS STRATEGIES: NEUTRAL 301
the gap is up, then our calls are going to ramp up in value
and become winners for us. If the gap is down, then our
puts are going to ramp up in value and become winners for
us. Of course, the opposite is true for the other side of the
trade. In a gap up our puts are going to stink, and in a gap
down our calls are going to stink. But here is the great
thing about options, and what makes the straddle such a
low-risk play: because of the delta factor, the losing side of
the trade will not lose as much as the winning side of the
trade will win.
As mentioned previously, delta, or the rate of change
in an option’s premium to change in the value of the under-
lying stock, increases as a trade moves more and more in-
the-money, and it decreases as a trade moves more and
more out-of-the-money. In other words, a big gap up will
increase the value of our calls more than it decreases the
value of our puts—and vice versa on a gap down. To our
bottom line, this means that as long as the stock moves big,
we should always show a profit on the trade because of the
delta factor, and normally that profit is large enough to
cover commissions and the spread and still post a solid
double-digit-percentage winner.
Now, after the opening gap, what usually happens is
that a “fade the news” mentality takes over, and traders seek
to close the gap. This is not always the case, so we always
have to anticipate a run in the direction of the gap. Often,
however, the gap will close and the market runs in the
opposite direction (a move we call, poetically, gap and crap).
With all this in mind, we can now establish our rules for
closing out the straddle position.
Here is how we take off the straddle.

If the market was oversold (we legged into the strad-

• We will sell our puts at the open and hold our

• We will hold our calls for every day the stock
puts in a green candle (close is higher than the

• If we are still in our calls on the fifth trading day

a gap up, puts in a gap down) at the open and

• We will hold our calls for every day the stock
puts in a green candle, or puts for every day the
stock puts in a red candle, up to five trading days
after the announcement.
• If we are still in our calls or puts on the fifth
trading day after the announcement, we will sell
them at the close.
If the market fails to gap more than $1.00 at the open,
then we have a judgment call to make. Generally, if the gap
is between $0.50 and $1.00, we can still simply follow the
rules as listed previously. The larger the dollar amount of
the gap, however, the more profitable the trade will be.
This is why it is so important to select stocks that are
higher in price, are very volatile, and have had a history of
multibucker gaps at earnings.
But if in the event a stock that has met all our other
conditions fails to open with a gap larger than $0.50, here
are the general rules to follow:
• If the market is oversold: sell the puts and hold the
calls, as previously described.
• If the market is overbought: sell the calls and hold
the puts, as previously described.
• If the market is neither oversold nor overbought: sell
the losing side of the trade and hold the winning
side, as previously described.
Our expected returns on any straddle depend a lot on
whether we legged in or not (we will always leg out). A per-
fect straddle trade is one where we generate a nice profit in

OPTIONS STRATEGIES: NEUTRAL 305
the three days prior to earnings on our first leg in. We have
to cash it out the next day on the gap for less than our max-
(cid:1)
imum profit, but we still bank, say, 10 percent. Then the
other side of the trade, which we just bought on the day of
earnings, gets a great ramp-up on the following day’s gap
(let’s say it ramps up 25 percent on the close) and contin-
ues to run for the next five days. By the close of the fifth
day, it may have doubled in premium value. This would
(cid:1) (cid:1)
give us a total return on investment of 55 percent ( 110
percent total divided by 2) in eight trading days. While not
all straddles run this well, enough do if you follow our rules
to the letter to make this a very profitable system. Losses
are normally small and usually just involve the loss of some
time value and the loss on spreads and commissions.
While these returns may sound ideal, keep in mind
that straddles work only during the peak of earnings sea-
son, so we have only about a 12- to 16-week window each
year. Moreover, there are quiet market cycles when even
the most volatile of stocks do not move that much in
response to earnings. During the straddle off-season, or
when the markets are less volatile, we will need to turn to
one or more of the other options strategies listed in the
previous two chapters.
THE STRADDLE STRATEGY:
AN 11-POINT REVIEW
The straddle is one of the best trading strategies you can
have in your arsenal of strategies. It takes some practice to
execute correctly, however, so the best advice I can give is
to trade the straddle initially with a very small amount of

capital (you can start with just one contract per side to get
the feel of it). But after an earnings season or two, you
should be able to put straddles on and off with some degree
of comfort.
Here is a review of the system as we outlined it in this
chapter:
1. Get a list of stocks reporting earnings three trading
days from today.
2. Eliminate all stocks not reporting earnings after the
bell.
3. Eliminate all stocks not trading more than 1 million
shares per day.
4. Eliminate all stocks with a beta less than 2.0.
5. Eliminate all stocks priced less than 40.00.
6. Check the chart to determine whether the stock
gapped more than $1.00 at its last two earnings
announcements. Eliminate those that did not.
7. Check the chart to determine whether the stock is
oversold or overbought using the following indicators:
• RSI (5) reading: less than 30 (oversold) or more
than 70 (overbought)
• Stochastics %K (5) reading: less than 25 (over-
sold) or more than 75 (overbought)
(cid:2)
• CCI (20) reading: less than 100 (oversold) or
(cid:1)
more than 100 (overbought)
8. We need agreement from any two of these
indicators to register an oversold or overbought

condition. If we get such a condition, then we will
leg into the trade:
• Buy the calls three days before earnings if over-
sold.
• Buy the puts three days before earnings if over-
bought.
• Then buy the other half of the trade before the
close on the day of the earnings announcement.
9. If neither oversold nor overbought, we will buy both
sides of the trade on the day of the announcement.
10. We will buy the same strike price for each side of
the trade, and it will be the nearest strike possible.
The expiration month chosen should follow the
same rules for all options trades, as listed in
Chapter 12.
11. We will hold both sides over the earnings
announcement, then leg out of the trade using the
rules listed in the previous section.
There is no substitute for hard work and real-time,
real-money experience when it comes to mastering the fine
art of trend-trading options. You have in this and the pre-
ceding two chapters a number of strategies for enhancing
your trend-trading returns using stock options. Now is the
time to put this information to work. Start small: buy a
couple of calls or puts instead of shares in a stock that meets
one of our trend-trading setups. After you are comfortable
with that, try one of the compound strategies listed here.
If we are in earnings season, try the straddle. You may soon
find yourself preferring options to stocks. But let me repeat

a warning I stated at the beginning of this section on
options: don’t even think about trend-trading options until
you are first a profitable trader of stocks. The leverage
found in options, along with the various factors that weigh
against your profit margin (the spread, time value decay,
decreasing delta), will soon bring your trading career to a
swift demise if you haven’t yet mastered the art of trend
trading.

the bigger vision:
where trend
trading can
take you
I
N this last chapter of the book, I’d like to share with you
two things. First, I want to talk about some of the life les-
sons that can be learned from trading. I’m of the opinion
that ifyou are not willing to learn these lessons, ifpride pre-
vents you from building the kind of character that can both
trade well and live well at the same time, then you are much
better off—and your friends and family are much better
off—ifyou can find some other way to improve your income.
And second, I want to share with you a vision I have for
where I’d like to see the whole stock-trading phenomenon
go over the next decade or two. It is a vision born out ofboth
my love for the trading game and my sense that it can pro-
vide immense benefit to a large, growing, and increasingly
frustrated demographic in our society: the overworked,
underpaid, and, all too often, exploited worker.
TRADE FOR A LIVING;
TRADE FOR LIFE

2002. The first half of the motto is taken from the title of
Alexander Elder’s famous book, the book that so greatly
influenced my shift from fundamental to technical analysis
(read the story in the Introduction) and, of course, that so
greatly influenced the title of this book. I have always loved
the phrase trading for a living. It evokes all the hope and
promise that caused so many doctors and lawyers back in
the late 1990s to leave their lucrative jobs and set up trad-
ing stations in the basements of their suburban homes, and
so many busboys and taxi drivers to buy shares of Amazon
and Qualcomm in between shifts. To trade is to hope: to
hope for a better life. But unlike many other hope-inducing
schemes, trading is one that can reasonably fulfill what it
promises.
I am convinced that anyone with the right mindset,
strategic tools, and real-time experience can become a suc-
cessful trader—successful enough to get out of debt, pay
cash for a daughter’s college education, retire early, and
endow a scholarship at an alma mater.
Beyond financial success, however, the school of trad-
ing can also be an important teacher of character. This is
where the second half of our motto comes in: not only can
trading provide a good living, it can also help you “get a life.”
Traders sometimes get a bad rap for being self-centered ego-
maniacs, and no doubt this is true for some of the better-
known names in the business. In many ways Wall Street
functions a lot like Las Vegas: the enticement ofa huge pay-
offhas a tendency to lure some ofhumanity’s most seriously
flawed characters. However, for every “mad money” clown,
there are 10 serious, principled, self-possessed traders grunt-
ing out a solid living for themselves and their families with

great integrity and generosity of spirit. I’m convinced that
they are that way, at least in part, because of their trading.
Funny thing about trading: it has this odd way of reinforc-
ing virtuous habits of character.
Let me suggest five ways in which trading can help
you improve your presence in this world. Is your spouse
anxious now that you are thinking about taking up trading
for a living? Then hand him or her this part of the book.
Spouses might be surprised to learn that the people they
are married to may well become better spouses as a result
of their trading careers.
Trading Teaches Patience
Probably the most obvious lesson you can learn from trad-
ing is to be more patient. Whether you are planning to
hold a trade for several weeks or only a few minutes, suc-
cessful trading requires patience. Patience means the good-
natured willingness to suffer (the Latin root of the word
patiencemeans “to suffer”) from the delay of an anticipated
good. In trading, the good anticipated is a healthy profit.
Oftentimes market conditions are such that that good is
delayed or even negated altogether. What do impatient
traders do? They act impulsively; they panic; they make
mistakes. They trade in and out when they should be hold-
ing. They dump small losers just before they turn into win-
ners, and they dump small winners just before they turn
into jackpots. No, impatient, impulsive traders will never
win at the trading game. Then who wins? Those with the
fortitude—a cardinal virtue, by the way, according to St.
Thomas Aquinas—to wait out the markets day in and day

out as they patiently apply their time-tested trend-trading
systems.
In addition to trading, I am also a runner. I’ve run one
marathon (and will never do that again!) and dozens of 5K
and 10K races, and I put in 20 to 30 miles per week on the
roads around our home. Running is a great deal like trad-
ing. On a long training run, it is imperative that you settle
into a quiet, efficient pace in order to put in the miles
needed to build up the capacity to endure the faster pace
of the race. Go out too quickly and you risk breaking down
before your goal distance. The correct pacing on a long run
requires patience: the runner must hold himself back, not
impulsively surge forward, in order to complete the goal.
The same is true with trading. The trading game is a mar-
athon run, not a sprint, and to win it you must patiently
pace yourself.
Trading Teaches You How to Listen
To read a chart properly, you have to pay close attention to
what the chart is trying to say. You have to develop the skill
of listening to something other than yourself. Too many of
us today are great at tuning in to ourselves. We engage for
blissful hours in self-dialogue, and when speaking with
others we are constantly thinking of ways to turn the con-
versation back to what we really want to talk about. Few of
us are very good at listening. Do you want to be a great
trader? Then you must become a great listener.
The chart is a pictorial form of language. The price
patterns, the indicators, the ebb and flow of volume: these
are the words charts use to speak to us. The trader must be

==================================================

THE BIGGER VISION: WHERE TREND TRADING CAN TAKE YOU 315
able to hear what is said and respond appropriately. Some-
times charts just speak noise. We avoid those charts. Some-
times charts speak beautiful music. Those are the charts
we play. In either case, we need to listen attentively to hear
what the charts have to say.
Listen to this, men: according to all the polls, what do
women want most in a man? No, not that! What women
want most is a man who will listen to them, pay attention
to them, a man who will “get” them. Guys, write this
down: trading can make you a better listener, and that can
make you downright sexy!
Trading Teaches You How to Be Forgiving
Imagine this scenario: you run your scans, you eyeball your
charts, and after several hours of intensive research you
come up with what looks to be the best trade of the week.
In fact, this chart is the best-looking chart you have seen
in a long time. The markets have been choppy and tough
to trade lately, but this setup looks like a surefire winner.
So at the open you fire off your stop-limit order to enter
the trade, and sure enough, half an hour later it executes.
You are now long XYZ in size. It closes the first day with a
(cid:1)
3 percent profit—not a bad start. It closes the second day
(cid:1) (cid:1)
at a 5 percent profit, and the third day at 7 percent. All
(cid:1)
is well, and you envision the trade hitting your 15 percent
profit target by the end of next week. That evening, how-
ever, the company comes out with some bad news: earnings
are not going to be as great as everyone expected and so
the company is lowering its guidance figures by a consid-
erable amount. The next day, the stock opens below your



==================================================

entry price and proceeds very quickly to trade down
through your stop-loss. You are out of the trade with a loss.
In a quick Wall Street minute your hopes have been
dashed.
How do you feel at this point? I’ll tell you how you
feel. You feel betrayed and resentful. The company’s man-
agement let you down. They are bumbling idiots. It’s all
their fault! Or, if you are a neurotic like me, you will blame
yourself. You should have done more research. You should
have taken some profits while you had the chance. You
should have seen that internal weakness in the chart. If only
this, and if only that, you will say. Regret and shame color
your mood.
Now, those are perfectly understandable emotional
responses to a disappointing experience. But are they the
best way to respond to a trade gone bad? Of course not.
Over time, those negative experiences (and at times they
will come in large batches) will eventually drive you out of
the trading game if you can’t get a handle on them. This is
precisely what trading teaches us to do: in order to get
beyond the blame game or the “woe is me” game, we need
to learn the art of forgiveness. Forgive the company for
mishandling a bad quarter. Forgive the chart for not draw-
ing your attention more strongly to that hidden pocket of
weakness. Forgive yourself for not being diligent enough,
or prescient enough, or whateverenough. Forgive and for-
get and move on to the next trade. It is an essential lesson
to learn in life—to forgive the mistakes of others as well as
your own—and it is an essential lesson to learn in the pro-
cess of trading for life.

==================================================

THE BIGGER VISION: WHERE TREND TRADING CAN TAKE YOU 317
Trading Teaches You to Hold Your
Biases Loosely
A bias is simply a partiality I hold toward some expected
outcome. Negatively, biases can hinder us from evaluating
a situation objectively. Positively, a bias is often the only
reason I would evaluate a situation in the first place. Let me
illustrate. It is often said that there is a liberal bias in the
media today. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that
that is true. Negatively, this means that media investiga-
tions of an event may not provide us with an objective read-
ing of what actually happened. Instead, what we get is an
assessment from the liberal perspective, not the whole
story. But positively, that liberal bias is likely what initiated
the investigation in the first place. Without that bias, there
might not have been enough interest to generate a news
story at all. Hence, biases can play a productive role if kept
in check: they generate the initial interest in an outcome
and give that outcome its significance.
Statistics defines accurate results as results that are
free of all bias. Science defines a well-designed study as one
that is free of all bias. But stock trading is not so objective.
We need an initial bias—bullish, bearish, or something in
between—in order to generate our initial interest in, and
then our directional commitment toward, a particular trad-
ing outcome. We need a sense of where we see the markets
headed over the short term at least so that we can apply the
most profitable trading systems for that market type. And
we need to know whether the chart we are scrutinizing is
more likely to move up, down, or sideways in the near



==================================================
                     PAGE 337                     
==================================================

318 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
future. This is why trend traders use technical analysis:
moving averages, trendlines, candlesticks, and indicators all
help us build a rational, probabilistic bias toward the mar-
kets in general as well as toward our individual trades.
Traders get into trouble, however, when they cling too
closely to their biases. Learn this market mantra: “Let the
markets do what they want to do!” If our bias gets us into a
trade and it turns out that our bias was wrong, we need to
cling loosely enough to it to let it go. Too strong a bias will
prevent us from doing what we should be doing with a
trade gone bad: taking the quick loss and moving on. Biases
can also hurt us with our winners. How many times have
we held on to a nice winner, believing in our bias that it
would be a big jackpot win only to see those paper profits
dwindle to nothing? All too often, no doubt. So again,
traders need to hold an initial bias toward the markets and
truly commit themselves to it in the form of real-money
trades, but they must also refuse to cling to that bias when
it proves to be a misread.
Trading Teaches You to Be Humble
This brings us to our last lesson: along with holding loosely
to our biases, trading teaches us to hold loosely to our
pride. The markets are just too big for any mere mortal to
conquer. There are too many vectors, too many inputs, too
many inter- and intramarket relationships, for any single
person to get a handle on them all—but put together a
string of healthy winners and you will soon feel like you
are (blast the fanfare) Master of the Market Domain! Strike

you. No one—not Buffett, not Cramer, not Seykota, not
Soros—masters the market. The best we can do is to learn
time-tested systems that put as much probability on our
side as possible, and then be diligent in applying those sys-
tems day in and day out.
Trading psychologist Bennett McDowell suggests in
an online article that a humble, submissive posture toward
the power of the markets is of much greater benefit than
an aggressive stance. He writes:
Some new traders who had to be aggressive in
their chosen businesses tend to think they need
to be aggressive with the markets. It seems logi-
cal. In fact, that is what made them successful
before as sales people, managers, executives, doc-
tors, business owners, entrepreneurs, etc. In
trading however, this aggressive type of behav-
ior can actually be your biggest weakness. The
belief that you can force the market to do what
you want and make your trade work, just won’t
happen! The markets are too big. In fact some of
the most successful traders I know approach the
market passively! They tend to “Follow” the mar-
kets and not force an outcome.
Again, learn this maxim: “Let the markets do what they
want to do!” This book gives you the tools necessary to do
just that and earn a great living from them. In truth, trend
trading is really all about trend following. You will note that
in nearly every setup we offer here, a trend is already in
place—either in price, in the indicators, or in both—before

we enter the trade. The prideful trader wants to glory in
trying to outthink the markets, to buy when everyone is
selling and to sell when everyone is buying in the hopes of
catching the reversal before anyone else sees it. But unless
you have insider information, or you are as business savvy
as a Warren Buffett or a Peter Lynch, it is best to stick with
what works. What works in trend trading is a humble pos-
ture toward the market, letting it tell us as clearly as pos-
sible what it is likely to do next.
Another area where pride needs to be swallowed and
humility adopted is that of sticking firmly to your trading
systems. Let me give you an example from one of the worst
trades I’ve made in recent memory. While my trading sys-
tems normally require that we sell prior to an earnings
announcement, I decided to hold one of my positions over
the announcement in the hope that the company, like it did
in the previous two quarters, would beat Street estimates.
(cid:1)
The company closed trading at a price of 25.48, a full 12
percent over our entry price. Our subscribers happily
logged their nice gain and moved on. I, however, woke the
next morning to find the same stock trading below 20.00
after both earnings per share (EPS) and guidance came in
below the Street. And when the dip buyers failed to come
to my rescue (the stock traded briefly under 18.00), I finally
sold my position for a very embarrassing loss.
This kind of agonizing mistake happens even to the
best of traders, but it cannot happen to successful traders
very often. What caused me to hold overnight? Well,
greed, pure and simple, yes, but also pride—the prideful
attitude that led me to believe that I knew better than my
own trading systems. Imagine that! So in short, for the sake

of your trading success, adopt a humble attitude toward
both the markets and your various trading disciplines. Both
know better than you do.
DR. STOXX’S BIG VISION:
MAKE EVERYONE A TRADER
Several years ago I sat in a commuter’s café in New York
City’s Grand Central Station with my brother-in-law,
Tony. As the caffeine began to whirl in our brains, we
talked of our mutual love for trading and how we both were
looking for ways to take our trading to the next level. By
that time I had developed most of the systems taught in this
book, and my online trading store, Befriendthetrend.com,
had just been launched. Tony is a computer programmer,
among other things (including owning his own ISP), and
he suggested that there might be a way to automate my
nightly research routine. He described the possibility of
software that would screen for each of our setups, suggest
entry prices and stop-losses, and even connect to an OLB
to send in the trade orders automatically. In this way, you
could truly trade for a living while being completely occu-
pied with some other activity (such as your day job).
That conversation never did get much further than
that, unfortunately. I am still waiting for Tony to sell his
business and devote himself full-time to programming our
software. But the conversation started me thinking of ways
I could expand the outreach of our services. Over the next
year, I began writing up various how-to manuals on differ-
ent trading strategies including swing trading, day trading,
and e-minis trading. All of these have sold very well over



==================================================
                     PAGE 341                     
==================================================

322 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
the years, and they are still hard to keep in stock. Then we
held a four-hour online seminar for over 200 beginning
traders. The seminar was so successful, we put on a second
seminar for intermediate to advanced traders the next
month. Soon I started getting calls from traders to serve
as their personal trading coach. Then came requests that I
set up a hedge fund for our clients who were too busy to
trade for themselves. So we did, and the Befriend the Trend
Fund was born (now approaching its fourth year). Then
there were requests for articles to trading publications. And
now this book. In short, my passion for trading quite
quickly became a small cottage industry.
Now, as we head into our seventh year in business at
Befriendthetrend.com, I find myself asking, “What’s next?
Where does the dream go from here?” Well, I’m not sure
where it willgo from here, but I can tell you where I’d like
it to go. Let me in summary form lay out a vision of where
I hope to see the trend-trading phenomenon go over the
next decade (and Befriendthetrend.com along with it).
Trading Centers
I’d love to see the development of trading and educational
centers across the United States and abroad. I’m not talk-
ing here about the notorious “prop shops” of the 1990s, so
many of which either went bankrupt or were indicted for
fraud. What I envision instead is a series of franchise-
worthy storefronts, located in suburban shopping malls as
well as downtown business districts, that would house trad-
ing stations, plenty offlat panels showing financial news, and
overhead monitors to flash market updates and charts of
interest on large screens. These would be cool, hip places—



==================================================
                     PAGE 342                     
==================================================

THE BIGGER VISION: WHERE TREND TRADING CAN TAKE YOU 323
with attention paid to interior design—where traders could
hang out together, talk stocks, trade their accounts, and
along the way, learn a thing or two. Managers of each cen-
ter would be highly adept at technical analysis and reading
between the lines of money flow and would be available to
traders for advice and training. Stocks showing promising
technical setups would be called out over loudspeakers and
their charts flashed up on the screens. In back rooms, sem-
inars would be taught each day for those wanting to
strengthen their trading skills. Espresso would be served
during market hours and then microbrews after the close.
Heck, forget about trading; it would just be a lot of fun to
hang out there, wouldn’t it?
I’m not sure what the best business plan would be to
make sure these centers are profitable. Perhaps they could
come under the wing of some of the bigger Wall Street
banks as an extension of their private client services.
What’s in it for them? A number of things: increased cus-
tomer base, enhanced customer loyalty, positive branding
(think Goldman Sachs meets Starbucks), investment diver-
sification (through owning commercial property), and cer-
tainly an increase in commission revenue, to name a few.
Monthly membership fees, a cut on the commission struc-
ture, and sales from beverages, music, seminars, and edu-
cational materials would likely make the individual shops
an attractive franchise.
Automated Money Machines
Well, one problem with the trading centers idea is that mar-
ket hours are usually when everyone has to work, doggone
it. Not everyone can (yet) trade for a living. Some of us

                     PAGE 343                     
==================================================

324 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
have to keep the old day job. So who is going to spend time
there on a Tuesday morning at 10 a.m.? Mostly retirees and
the unemployed, both groups that tend not to have the kind
of discretionary funds needed to open a trading account.
So here is an alternative that would also serve the same
purpose of bringing more people into the trading game:
build software for use at home that would completely auto-
mate the trading process. If we can find a way to mecha-
nize the setup screening, and if we can find a way to enter
orders automatically, and if the same software can then
update those orders at each market close, in effect we will
have created an automatic money machine. We will have
turned all my years of hard work into a regular ATM.
Is this possible? Sure it is. Currently there exist chart
pattern recognition software, technical parameter screen-
ing software, and automated order entry and order man-
agement systems. Why couldn’t all these be put together
into a single package? Why couldn’t we design software to
(1) determine the general market type (as mentioned pre-
viously), (2) screen for trade setups to match the market
type, and (3) enter and exit those setups automatically, in
hands-off fashion? Certainly this can be done. Any soft-
ware engineers out there in need of a job?
Okay, there is one glaring problem facing the creation
and marketing of such a trading machine. Let’s say we were
successful in building an automatic money machine that
would screen for and trade only the most fitting of all our
trend-trading setups. And let’s say we then wanted to offer
this software to the public. So we hire a top-notch adver-
tising firm and get the word out. We put on e-mail cam-
paigns; we send out direct-mail fliers; we buy radio and



==================================================
                     PAGE 344                     
==================================================

THE BIGGER VISION: WHERE TREND TRADING CAN TAKE YOU 325
even television time. And soon the orders come streaming
in. We sell 500 copies . . . and then 1,000 . . . and then word
of mouth kicks in and we are quickly up to 5,000, then
10,000. Then we make a few refinements, bring out the 2.0
version, and sell another 10,000 copies. So now there are
20,000 traders out there using our money machine to trade
their accounts automatically. That’s a reasonable figure for
a piece of software that might retail for around $2,000 (plus
the monthly data fee).
Do you see where this is going? Let me spell it out.
Say the machine issues a signal to buy KLAC at 50.00 per
share. KLAC is a pretty heavily traded stock. The average
number of shares traded is around 5 million per day. But
look what happens when 20,000 traders get the same sig-
nal to buy KLAC at 50.00 per share. If each trader takes an
average position of 500 shares (some a lot more, some a lot
less), that makes for 10 million shares aiming at a single
entry price of 50.00. That’s over twice the average daily
volume trying to enter the market in the first minute of
trading. Is that going to happen? No way. Either KLAC
will gap up and over 50.00 and not look back, or it will gap
open at 50.00, run up a bit, then collapse once all that vol-
ume is assimilated. Neither scenario provides a profitable
trading environment.
Is there a solution? Yes there is, and it’s called diversi-
fication. We need to come up with not one money machine
but dozens of them. We need to have money machines for
day traders, scalpers, swing traders, overnight and position
traders; for those with high-risk and those with low-risk tol-
erances; for large account and small account traders; for
professional money managers; and for the average Joe trad-

ing his IRA. Then come the sector money machines, the
ETF money machines, the e-mini money machines, the
Forex money machines—and on and on it goes. In this way
we spread the wealth, the order flow, and, hence, the risk
as well.
Personal Trading Coaches Network
One last dream I have for trend trading over the next decade
is to establish a network of personal trading coaches. These
coaches would be trained at one ofseveral training facilities
(see the trading centersidea mentioned previously) to serve
individual traders in need ofprivate coaching. And why not?
Today we have fitness coaches, weight loss coaches, child-
birth coaches, and motivation coaches. We hire coaches to
help us learn how to cook, knit, do yoga, and get closer to
God. Why not hire a coach to help us learn how to trade?
I envision a network of dedicated, licensed profes-
sional traders who, as a means to supplement their income,
would travel to the client’s home for a series of one-on-one
sessions. In this private setting, every aspect of trading
could be covered, from setting up the watch lists to screen-
ing out the best trades. Higher-level skills such as tape
reading, spread trading, and hedging could be taught to
more advanced clients. And all clients would benefit from
various trading visualization exercises led by the coach in
order to bolster the healthy trader’s mindset.
I know that this kind of one-on-one mentoring really
works well for taking a mediocre trader, even a losing
trader, to a high level of trading success. I’ve been privi-
leged to coach several of our clients personally, in their

homes at their own computers, and have found it to be a
very rewarding teaching experience. Certainly it is the
most efficient way to convey trading knowledge. Often it
is simply a matter of spotting one thing the trader was
doing wrong and then suggesting a remedy. In other cases
it is a matter of doing some serious structural work on the
entire trading system. However the coaching proceeds, it
is a wonderfully effective process, and I would like to see
it become more and more accessible.

final thoughts
T
REND-TRADINGstocks and options can be one of the
most exciting, and certainly one of the most challenging,
hobbies you can have. Over time, and with the right edu-
cation and experience, it can become a very profitable
hobby—so profitable, in fact, that you can make a very nice
living from it and never have to hold a real job again (unless
you consider sitting in front of a computer and clicking a
mouse now and then a real job). I believe that you now hold
in your hands all you need to know to take your trading to
the highest levels of success. Trend trading is right at the
sweet spot of what trading is all about, and this book is your
key to learning how to trend-trade.
Trend trading can be the means to many wonderful
and important ends, but as soon as it becomes your raison
d’etre, you have lost the battle for balance. Here is a test:
What is the first thing you think about when you wake up?
What is the last thing you think about as you drift off to
sleep at night? Is it the same thing? And is that thing trad-
ing? Now here is a warning: if your first and last thoughts
of the day are about trading, then trading for you is no
longer a hobby—it is an addiction.

330 TREND TRADING FOR A LIVING
It is natural (and I’m speaking from experience) to be
so excited about your trading successes that the joy and
hope of it all color everything else you do with a resplen-
dent glory. It is likewise natural (again from experience) to
feel so despondent about your trading failures that every-
thing else you do is burdened by a dark melancholy. If you
do not have some means of getting beyond this emotional
roller coaster, of living a life of stable productivity despite
what the market does, it is perhaps best if you do not take
up trading at all. Or better yet: determine right now to
build into yourself the kind of character that can function
well, relate well, and in every way be well regardless of what
the market does with your money.
You now know where to open your online trading
account, which charting package to use, how to set up your
charts and watch lists, how to scan and screen each day for
viable setups, how to whittle your results down to the best
one or two setups each day, and at what price to enter and
exit your trades. You also have a variety of resources that
should help you develop the sort of mental approach to
your trading that will allow you to follow our guidelines.
This is a complete system. Study the setups in this book
until their various parameters are memorized. Then apply
them rigorously, and watch as slowly, over time, your
account begins to blossom.
I want to leave you with three final thoughts.
The first is this: be patient with yourself and with your trad-
ing. Trend trading is not by any means a get-rich-quick
scheme, but it potentially is a get-rich-slow scheme. You
will see net gains over time. Over the long haul (and I mean
years, not months), you will see substantial gains. Stick



==================================================
                     PAGE 350                     
==================================================

FINAL THOUGHTS 331
with this system for a lifetime and you may very well see
phenomenal gains.
The second is this: there is always room in every trader’s
toolbox for ingenuity. While I’ve made every effort to make
our 10 trading setups and our options systems as mechan-
ical as possible, 1,000 traders reading this book and apply-
ing our 10 setups will not come up with the same stocks to
trade. There is room for interpretation, even experimen-
tation within the basic parameters. It is important to find
what you are most comfortable with, what best suits your
temperament and lifestyle, and then stick with that. And
that sticking-to-it-ness really is the key: once you have your
system established, stick with it!
The third is this: you can do it! No matter what language
you speak, where you went to school, how much money
you have to start with (okay, that one matters a little), you
can open a trading account, buy a few shares, put on stop-
loss and target orders, and make some money. Don’t let fear
get in your way.
If confusion is now your obstacle, then that is my fault
and I am wholeheartedly sorry. Write me, “Dr Stoxx,” at
support@befriendthetrend.com if you have any questions.
I am always here to help. God bless you in all your endeav-
ors, and especially as you trend-trade for a living!

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Dr. Thomas Carr,or Dr. Stoxx, as he is widely known in the trad-
ing community, has been actively involved in the markets since 1996,
following several years of studying technical analysis. He holds a
master’s of divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary,
and master’s and doctorate degrees in philosophy and theology from
Oxford University. In addition to trading and managing a small
hedge fund, Dr. Carr is a tenured professor of religious studies and
philosophy at Mount Union College in Ohio. He has been inter-
viewed by the Wall Street Journaland U.S. News and World Reportfor
his insights into trading psychology. His previous publications on
trading have appeared in Active Traderand Technical Analysis of Stocks
and Commodities. Dr. Carr is also the author ofthe popular textbook,
Introducing Death and Dying (2005: Prentice-Hall).
Dr. Stoxx began trading as a part-time hobby until two years
oflosses forced him to do more research. He attended several trad-
ing seminars and studied under some of the top names in the busi-
ness, including Alexander Elder, Steve Nison, and Welles Wilder.
Soon he began experimenting with his own trading systems. The
result was a set of time-tested, proprietary trading methods that
have proved to be very profitable in all types of market conditions.
These systems are based on the essentials of technical analysis but
also incorporate Dr. Stoxx’s unique method ofassessing market psy-
chology, sector strength, and general market directionality. Highly
skilled as a tape reader, Dr. Stoxx possesses an uncanny ability to
time his entries and exits, often just prior to major moves. Dr. Stoxx
is CEO of Befriend the Trend Trading, a Web-based advisory and
trading education service (www.befriendthetrend.com). He also
serves as general partner ofa capital management company that pro-
vides wealth-creating opportunities for accredited investors.
Dr. Stoxx lives with his wife and two daughters in northeast-
ern Ohio. He is in frequent demand as a seminar speaker and pri-
vate trading coach. For booking information, please send enquiries
to drstoxx@befriendthetrend.com.
