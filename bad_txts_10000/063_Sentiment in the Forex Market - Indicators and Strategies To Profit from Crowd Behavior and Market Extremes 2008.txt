A
s public interest in the FX market has skyrocketed, so too has the
amountoftechnicalandfundamentalresearchavailabletoaspiring
traders.Anareathathasfailedtoreceivethesameamountofatten-
tion is often considered part of the technical approach: sentiment. After
thenewsreleasesaredigestedbyfloortraders,thefundamentalsdigested
by economists, and the latest comments from the central banker are dis-
sected, the market’s trend is still a product of underlying sentiment. That
is the premise of this book. Much (if not most) of the information fed to
retail traders is of little use when it comes to making money by trading.
Tradingishardlyassimpleasbuyingorselling,becauseaneconomicindi-
catorisgoodorbad.Similarly,thegameisnotasblackorwhiteasbuying
orselling,becausepriceisaboveorbelowamovingaverage.
For one, I hope to prove that traditional approaches such as the eco-
nomic indicator approach do not work. No consistent correlation exists
between the U.S. dollar and U.S. economic indicators, but conventional
wisdomsaysthatthetwomoveinlockstep.Whyisthisapproachfollowed
so fervently if its foundation is rooted in falsities? The reason that mar-
kets move in identifiable patterns is probably the same reason that many
acceptasgospeltheconventionalapproachestomarketanalysisandtrad-
ing that have marginally successful track records at best. That reason is
thepropensityforhumanstofollowthecrowd,especiallyinsituationsas
emotionallydrivenastrading.Althoughtherearenodoubtverysuccessful
news traders, the cost to the trader is significant: an expensive machine
such as Bloomberg or Reuters, turbulent market conditions just after a
news release, and most important—the emotional impulses that are our
worst enemy in trading are heightened, and the ability to make a rational
decisionjustafteranewsreleaseisgreatlyreduced.IthinkthatIcanshare

The Argument
for a
Sentiment-Based
Approach
A
t its core, sentiment is a general thought, feeling, or sense. In free
markets, sentiment refers to the feelings and emotions of market
participants. All of the participants’ feelings toward a specific mar-
ketresultinadominantpsychologythatiseitheroptimisticorpessimistic.
Every change in price results from a change in the balance between opti-
mismandpessimism.Priceitselfisaresultofwherecollectivepsychology
lies in the never-ending oscillation between optimism and pessimism. As
oscillationsuggests,thepsychologicalstateofamarketexperiencespeaks
(optimistic extreme) and troughs (pessimistic extreme). These sentiment
extremesarewhataffectmarkettopsandbottoms.
In the 1932 edition of Charles Mackay’s classic Extraordinary Popu-
lar Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, Bernard Baruch wrote in the
foreword that “all economic movements, by their very nature, are moti-
vated by crowd psychology.” Baruch went on to write in the same fore-
wordthat“withoutduerecognitionofcrowd-thinking(whichoftenseems
crowd-madness) our theories of economics leave much to be desired.”1
It seems that so many, if not most, of the members of the financial com-
munity seem to forget these basic truths. Analysts, traders, and financial
media members attribute reasons to price movements with an uncanny
ease.
For example, “The government reported a larger than expected in-
creaseinthenumberofjobscreated,whichsupportedtheU.S.dollar.”For-
getthatthesamereportonemonthearlierindicatedthatfewerjobswere
created than expected...and the dollar rallied anyway. On that day, the

headline probably read something like this: Dollar Rallies Despite Down-
beat Jobs Report. These examples are hypothetical, but if you follow the
currencymarket,youhaveundoubtedlywitnessedsimilarinconsistencies
infinancialreporting.Howcanthemovementofacurrencybeattributed
to an outside event such as the release of an economic indicator one
month when the same currency and same economic indicator show ab-
solutelynorelationshipinothermonths?Ifarelationshipexistsonlysome
ofthetime,thenbydefinitionthereisnoconsistent relationship.Yet,the
majority of market participants base trading decisions on economic indi-
cators anyway. Why? Even though the approach is suspect, it is conven-
tional and popular and humans like to be with the crowd, even if they
are wrong. It is much easier to be wrong in a crowd than be wrong by
yourself.
Baruch also wrote in the foreword of Extraordinary Popular Delu-
sionsandtheMadnessofCrowdsthat:
Entomologists may be able to answer the question about the midges
and to say what force creates such unitary movement by thousands
of individuals, but I have never seen the answer. The migration of
some types of birds; the incredible mass performance of the whole
species of ocean eels; the prehistoric tribal human eruptions from
Central Asia; the Crusades; the mediaeval dance crazes; or, getting
closertoeconomics,theMississippiandSouthSeaBubbles;theTulip
Craze; and (are we too close to add?) the Florida boom and the
1929 market-madness in America and its sequences in 1930 and
1931—allthesearephenomenaofmassactionunderimpulsionsand
controls which no science has explored. They have power unexpect-
edlytoaffectanystaticconditionorso-callednormaltrend.Forthat
reason, they have place in the considerations of thoughtful students
ofworldeconomicconditions.2

This is the rule in all financial markets, where man’s impulse to herd

TheArgumentforaSentiment-BasedApproach 3
A popular (if not the most popular) model used to trade foreign ex-
change(FX)amongretailtradersisbasedoneconomicindicators.Under
this approach, a trader will buy a country’s currency if the news of that
countryisconsideredgood.Ifthenewsofacountry’scurrencyisconsid-
eredbad,thenthetradersellsthatcountry’scurrency.Thismodelassumes
that EMH governs markets because it assumes that market participants
willmakeobjectivetradingdecisionsbasedonrationalthought(buyifthe
newsisgoodandsellifthenewsisbad).However,marketparticipantsdo
notmakeobjectivetradingdecisionsbasedonrationalthought;theymake
subjective trading decisions based on emotions. If you have ever traded
FX,thenyouknowthisbecauseyouhavewitnessedacurrencyrallythat
followed a worse than expected jobs report or an increase in that coun-
try’stradedeficit.Still,thenewswasexplainedinordertorationalizethe
marketmovement.Ifexplainingthenewsinordertorationalizethemarket
movementprovestoodifficult,thenthemarketmoveisoftenattributedto
a“technical”correctionorsomethingsimilar.
This is not to say that news and economic releases are unimportant.
It is imperative that you know when the releases occur because volatil-
ity spikes during these times as a great number of traders are involved in
themarket.Sometimesthecorrectmoveistofadetheinitialreaction.For

WHAT IS FUNDAMENTAL?
Anyonewhoisanygoodatanythingwilltellyouthatpreparationisjustas
important, if not more important, than whatever it is that you are prepar-
ingfor.Successfulactorsresearchtheirrolesbeforefilmingbegins.Sports
teamspracticeandwatchfilmsoftheiropponentsbeforetheyplayagainst
them.Similarly,inordertotradesuccessfully(especiallyinahighlylever-
agedmarketsuchasFX),youmusthaveaplan,anapproach.Anapproach
should not consist of buying because an economic indicator was strong
or selling because the same economic indicator was weak. You probably
havegatheredbynowthatIdonotfindvalueintraditionalfundamentals.
Whatisconsidered“fundamental”—primarilyeconomicindicators—isnot
actually fundamental to price at all. The charts in Chapter 2 support
thisclaim.
Although I lean toward a technician’s point of view, a successful ap-
proach to market analysis and trading is not as simple as buying because
price is above the moving average or selling because price is below the
moving average. Trading is hardly this black and white. A grasp of what
is really fundamental to a market’s movement—sentiment—is the key to
successinthegameoftradingandspeculation.
TOP-DOWN APPROACH
The trader must process information (preparation) before making a de-
cision (the trade). There are two approaches to processing information:
top-downandbottom-up.Whenimplementingatop-downapproach,infor-
mationregardingthebigpictureisgatheredfirst.
Big picture is the sentiment backdrop as defined by analysis of indi-
cators such as (but not limited to) the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s (CFTC’s) Commitment of Traders (COT) reports. Does fu-
tures positioning indicate that the currency in question is at or is nearing
anoptimisticorpessimisticextreme?Isthefinancialmediaprovidingany
signals? It may sound unconventional (because it is—which is probably
whyitworks),butthefinancialmediaoftenprovidesexceptionallytimely
signals. It is just as important to know when a market is not extreme be-

arealwaysfightingthetrendandnevermakemoney.
After you feel that you have correctly gauged the psychological state
of the market, it is time to assess your risk and time your trade. Knowl-
edge of the market’s structure is essential to this next step. All markets

exhibit the same patterns, on all time frames. This is known as the El-
liottwaveprinciple,orsimplythewaveprinciple.Inthe1930s,RalphNel-
son Elliott discovered that crowd behavior will trend and countertrend
in recognizable patterns. Although he primarily studied the stock mar-
ket, the wave principle can be applied to any freely traded market. The
size of the FX market makes it a perfect candidate for an analysis tech-
nique based on crowd behavior. You will be amazed at the accuracy
with which you can gauge support and resistance and forecast direc-
tion and the extent of the directional move with knowledge of the wave
principle.
Traditional technical indicators such as moving averages and oscilla-
tors aid in identifying the trend but should be used as secondary tools to
sentimentindicatorsandpricepatterns.Afterall,youaretradingprice,not
theindicator.
Thegoalofthisbookistoprovidethetoolsnecessaryfordeveloping
a top-down, sentiment-based approach to trading and speculation in FX.
I refrain from providing specifics such as entries or risk control because

REMINISCENCESOFASTOCKOPERATOR
If there is one trading book that has had a profound impact on me, then
without a doubt that book is Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, written
in 1923 by Edwin Lefe´vre. The fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore
(somesaythatheactuallywroteit),oneofWallStreet’sall-timegreatspec-
ulators,thestoryistoldthroughtheeyesofthefictionalLarryLivingston.
(Livermore was the inspiration for Livingston.) Livingston’s experiences
and related commentary ring true to the point that it is hard to believe
thatLivermorehimselfdidnotwritethebook.Regardlessofwhowroteit,

Translation:Sentimenthasbeen,is,andalwayswillbefundamental
to price in any market. Price patterns that occurred 50 or 100 years ago
occur now and will occur in the future. A market price is determined by
fear and greed, which is manifested through the activities of the market
participants; traders, investors, speculators, and the like. This will never
change.

In the FX market, fundamental analysis refers to analysis of a coun-
try’s economic conditions. This includes macroeconomic indicators such
as growth rates, interest rates and monetary policy, inflation, and unem-
ployment. The fundamental analyst and/or trader believes that he or she
can analyze these macroeconomic indicators, arrive at a bullish or bear-
ish bias regarding the currency in question, and trade accordingly. Remi-
niscences of a Stock Operator sumsuptheeffectivenessoftradingbased
strictlyonnewsevents(economicindicatorsareconsiderednewsevents).
The main character, Larry Livingston, remarks that “the trend has been
established before the news is published, and in all bull markets bear
itemsareignoredandbullnewsitemsexaggerated;andviceversa.”1 This
was true in 1923 when Reminiscences was first published, and it is true

Theoppositeistruewhenconsideringfinancialspeculation(currency
trading, in this case). The conventional approach (the approach that the
crowd follows), which relies on studying economic indicators in order to
trade the FX market, does not work in my opinion. One look at a chart
disproves the myth that a positive correlation exists between economic
indicatorsandcurrencyvaluesoveranymeaningfultimeperiod.
More than 90 percent of all currency trades involve the U.S. dollar;

HOW THE HUMAN BRAIN WORKS
In The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior, Robert Prechter cites
theresearchofPaulMacLean,formerheadoftheLaboratoryforBrainEvo-
lution at the National Institute of Mental Health, in order to explain from
a biological perspective why investment and trading decisions are based
on emotions, not rational thought. In The Triune Brain in Evolution,
MacLean proposes that the brain consists of three parts: the R-complex,
the limbic system, and the neocortex. The R-complex is the part of the
brain that humans share with other animals and even reptiles. The reptil-
ianbrainincludesthebrainstemandcerebellum,whichcontrolssurvival
instincts such as muscles, balance, breathing, and heartbeat. The limbic

edgeadequatetoformanindependentconviction,whichmakesthemseek

whichtoexercisereason;youronlyalternativeistoassumethattheherd

later prove that market participants herd. By definition, herding means
that the emotional part of the brain, the limbic system, is in charge. Re-
member, this is the same part of the brain that controls fighting and the
emotionoflove.Doyoueverthinkrationallywhenitcomestofightingor
love?Similarly,theneocortex(rationalthought)issubservientinfinancial
speculation. Therefore, the study of sentiment indicators, or the study of
crowds, is more important than the study of economic indicators, if you
wishtomakemoneytrading.
The charts in this chapter support this assertion. What most assume
is important regarding currency valuation actually has little impact, aside
fromknee-jerkreactionsjustaftertheeconomicrelease.
THE MYTH OF ECONOMIC INDICATORS
Asmentionedearlier,onewouldthinkthatsincemorethan90percentof
all currency trades involve the U.S. dollar, consistent correlations would
exist between the dollar and various economic indicators. But we know
thattheemotionalpartofthebrainrulesdecisionmakingduringfinancial
speculation, which is a herding process, so it is unlikely that there is a
consistent correlation. If there were consistent correlations between the
U.S.dollar andeconomic indicators, thenone wouldhave toassume that
trading decisions were being based on rational thought, which simply is
notthecase.

All of the charts shown here are monthly (since the indicators that
we are looking at are released once a month) and the correlations are
3-year(36-month)correlations.Theeconomicindicatorsthatareassumed

lararethenonfarmpayrollsreport(EmploymentSituation),theTreasury
International Capital number (investment flows), the U.S. trade balance,

have included rather detailed descriptions of the economic indicators as
well. If you are going to enter into a debate with someone who contends
that economic indicators are the secret to trading success, then it is wise
to know what you are arguing about. You will also see that some of the
waysinwhichtheeconomicnumbersarecalculatedaresuspect,tosaythe
least.
NONFARM PAYROLLS
On the first Friday of the month, the Employment Situation report is
releasedbytheBureauofLaborStatistics(BLS).Tobehonest,therelease
of the indicator can, and often does, lead to one of the more exciting
days to be in the market. It makes sense that analysts and traders would
assume that employment is critical to currency valuation. A country that
cannot employ its citizens is certainly facing economic problems. In the
UnitedStates,consumerspendingaccountsforroughly70percentofgross
domesticproduct(GDP).Alossofjobswillmostlikelyleadtoadecrease
in discretionary income, which leads to a decline in consumer spending,
which leads to a decline in GDP (we will look at GDP later). It seems
logical that the release of the Employment Situation report would be a
maindeterminantinthepriceoftheDollarIndex(DXY),andbyextension
the EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, and so forth. However, remember that
the market is far from logical. Believing that the market will move based
onwhatshouldbelogicalisthekindofthinkingthatgetsusintroublein
trading.
The big number within the Employment Situation, and the number
that we will examine, is the change in nonfarm payrolls. The calculation
of the employment statistics includes people age 16 and older. The BLS
defines employed people as those who have worked and been paid for
their work by someone else or by themselves. Those who are on leave
from a job, paid or unpaid, are also considered employed. Examples in-
clude maternity or paternity leave, illness, or vacation. Unemployed peo-

difference,wherethejobscreatedwerefarmorethanexpected,wasMay
2004.Interestingly,May2004wasapositivesurpriseofmorethan188,000,
yet the DXY actually fell 1.91 percent that month. All of the other differ-
ences were negative surprises. In other words, the jobs created were far
less than expected. The conventional approach assumes that a negative
surprise is negative for the dollar so the DXY should fall during those
months. The dollar did fall in July 1999 (significant loss), April 2003, and
September2004,butthedollargainedinNovember1999(significantgain),
August 2000 (significant gain), and June 2001 (not much of a gain). The
evidenceindicatesthatthechangeinnonfarmpayrolls,evenchangesthat

GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
Gross domestic product (GDP) is considered the “broadest, most com-
prehensivebarometeravailableofacountry’soveralleconomiccondition.
GDP is the sum of the market values of all final goods and services pro-
ducedinacountryduringaspecificperiodusingthatcountry’sresources,
regardlessoftheownershipoftheresources.”7 GDPincludesdataonper-
sonal income and consumption expenditures, corporate profits, national
income,andinflation.IntheUnitedStates,GDPisreportedquarterlyand
by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Al-
though released quarterly, there are actually three versions: the advance
report, the preliminary report, and the final report. The different versions
ofthereportresultinareleaseeverymonth,buttwo-thirdsofthereleases
arerevisions.
The advance report is released one month following the quarter re-
ported on. The first report of the year then is the advance report for the
fourth quarter of the previous year. For example, the advance report for
2006 fourth quarter GDP was released on January 31, 2007. One month
later, or two months following the end of the quarter, the preliminary re-
portisreleased.Thisisthefirstrevision.Thesecondrevisioniscontained

What’s more, “every five years the BEA issues a so-called benchmark

TRADE BALANCE
A country’s trade balance is the value of its net imports subtracted from
thevalueofitsnetexportsoveraspecifictimeperiod.Naturally,theU.S.
trade balance is reported, or valued, in U.S. dollars. A country, such as
China,thatexportsmorethanitimportshasatradesurplus.Acountrythat
importsmorethanitexportshasatradedeficit.TheUnitedStatescarries
theworld’slargesttradedeficitatover$700billion,orcloseto$60billion
per month. Many analysts see deficits as detrimental to the currency of
the country running the deficit. The thinking is that deficits are corrected
by free markets as floating currency rates rise or fall over time in order
toencourage exports over imports, reversing again infavor ofimportsas
thecurrencygainsstrength.FormoreinformationregardingtheU.S.trade

The Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system is the
U.S. government’s source of data on capital flows into and out of
the United States, excluding direct investment, and the resulting
levels of cross-border claims and liabilities. The data is used by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the computation of the U.S.
Balance of Payments accounts and the U.S. International Invest-
mentPosition.Informationiscollectedfromcommercialbanksand
other depository institutions, bank holding companies, securities
brokers and dealers, custodians of securities, and nonbanking en-

nonbanking reports exclude accounts of nonbanking enterprises in
the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad
or with their foreign parent companies. Such accounts with foreign
affiliates are reported by business enterprises to the Commerce De-
partment on its direct investment forms. There was an exception

opposite the country or geographical area where the foreigner is lo-

SecuritiesTransactions
The data series are based on submissions of monthly TIC Form S,
“PurchasesandSalesofLong-TermSecuritiesbyForeigners.”These
reports are mandatory and are filed by banks, securities dealers,
investors, and other entities in the U.S. who deal directly with for-
eign residents in purchases and sales of long-term securities (eq-
uities and debt issues with an original maturity of more than one
year) issued by U.S. or foreign-based firms. Typically, the data se-
ries are revised for up to 24 months after the initial “as of” report-
ing date. The data are released to the public with a lag of about
11/2 months. The data reflect only those transactions between U.S.
residents and counterparties located outside the United States. The

PRODUCER AND CONSUMER
PRICE INDEXES

Like most U.S. economic indicators, the releases occur at 8:30 A.M. ET.
Botharereleasedmid-monthbutthePPIisreleasedadaybeforetheCPI.
The PPI measures the average change over time in the selling prices re-
ceived by domestic producers of goods and services. The calculation of
PPI involves price changes for about 100,000 goods, which are separated
into over 10,000 different producer price indexes. PPIs are available for
the products of nearly every industry in the mining and manufacturing
sectors of the U.S. economy. There are three major categories that the
10,000 indexes fall into: commodity indexes, industry indexes, and stage-
of-processing indexes. The stage-of-processing indexes include crude
materials, intermediate materials, and finished goods. The finished goods
indexes are usually focused on because they are the items that have the
greatest impact on the consumer, who is responsible for roughly 70 per-
centofU.S.GDP.

What Does the Chart Say?
The assumption is that increased inflation (higher PPI and CPI readings)
is positive for a currency. Most analysts focus on what action the Fed-
eral Reserve might or might not take in response to an inflation number.
Figure 2.7 shows that there is no consistent correlation between the fed
funds rate and the DXY, either. If inflation is elevated, then central banks
increase interest rates in order to combat inflation. Higher interest rates
can bolster a currency by giving better returns on fixed-income invest-
ments.Thislineofthinkingisconvincingbutincorrect.Ifitwerecorrect,

The Power of
Magazine Covers
Y
ouareprobablyaskingyourself,“Whatisachapteronmagazinecov-
ers doing in a book about currency trading?” Magazine covers are
oneofthebestindicatorsofmasspsychologyand,byextension,one
of the best signals that a market is close to forming a significant top or
bottom. Markets, like life in general, are not linear. Markets change di-
rection and bullish (optimism) for a top and bearish (pessimism) for a
bottom—extreme sentiment—is required to effect that change. A major
magazine would not devote its cover story to a financial market unless
thestoryinquestionwasconsiderednewsworthy.Astory(especiallyone
about the value of a currency) is not considered newsworthy to a major
magazine unless the public is obsessed with the story, and an obsessed
public defines extreme sentiment. Since sentiment extremes accompany
marketturns,byassociation,majormagazinecoversarecontrarianindica-
torsandsignalmarketturns.
Theideathatmagazinecoverscanbeusedascontrarianindicatorsin
financial markets is not new. Paul Montgomery of Universal Economics
has studied the covers of major news magazines for years and found that
whenamagazine’scovertakesadirectionalstandonthestockmarket,that
market usually forms a significant top (if the cover is bullish) or bottom
(if the cover is bearish). The same concept can be applied to the foreign
exchangemarket.

Appearing on the top right-hand corner of the February 2, 1985, The

coverstory,buttheeditorsfeltthattheultra-depressedleveloftheBritish
pound was newsworthy enough for at least a portion of the cover. The
GBPUSD exchange rate closed the week of February 1, 1985, at 1.1110.
Weakness was attributed to the falling price of oil. In the words of The
Economist, “Sterling is a petrocurrency whose exchange rate is affected
byIranianmullahs,OPECtalks,andthelogicalpressureofmarketforces

anall-timelow(takingintoconsiderationsyntheticDEMrates,theall-time
lowwasactuallyinFebruary1985at.7155),closingonSeptember15that
.8532.Thefirstparagraphofthecoverstoryreads,
The echoes from the 1970s and 1980s are becoming oppressive. Oil
crises, fuel shortages, street blockades and protests, currency woes,
paralyzed governments, excessive taxes: to many observers, both
within and beyond Europe, it must seem as if the old continent is
once again locked in the grip of its old disease, eurosclerosis, which
first struck a quarter of a century ago, just after the 1973 oil shock.
WasallthepromiseofEurope’ssinglemarketanditsnewcurrency,
coupled with the oft talked-of spread of Thatcherite supply-side re-
formsacrossthecontinent,justanillusion?6
This lead paragraph captures the pessimistic sentiment that perme-
ated the minds of traders and investors at that time regarding the euro.
The article later read, “Many voices are now proclaiming that the single
currency has ‘failed’ and that Europe’s sickly economies are doomed to
be left behind by a resurgent America—and they do not come only from
hardened British Eurosceptics. Recent polls suggest that support for the
euro has sunk to new lows in Germany, and the Danish referendum that
is being held later this month on whether to join the euro now rests on a
knife-edge.”7
Another article in the same issue, titled “Europe’s Economies—
StumblingYetAgain?,”mentionedthat,“Newspaperheadlinesarefretting
aboutthefactthattheeurohasfallentoa‘recordlow’ofbelow86cents,
27% below its starting level in January 1999. Some dealers predict that it
could soon hit 80 cents, even though it is already well below most esti-
matesofitsfairvalue.”8
Does the environment described in these articles sound like one that
is euro bullish? Of course not. Even the professionals (the dealers) were
predicting 80 cents. Of course, the EURUSD found a bottom in the week
that ended October 27, 2000, at .8225, six weeks after the cover of The
Economist read “Euroshambles.” The rate challenged .9600 three months
later, consolidated for a year, and then rallied nearly 5,000 pips in three
years. (See Figure 3.5.) Interestingly, the most timely signal to exit euro

500 Index had declined over 37 percent from its March 2000 high. One of
the largest financial bubbles in history had burst, and most market par-
ticipants expected stock markets to continue sliding for a while longer.
The financial landscape and mentality of investors was described by The
EconomistinitsJune22,2002,issue.Thecoverofthisissuewasofaburn-
ing $100 bill, in the shape of the United States, and the title on the cover
was“AnEconomySinged.”Hereisanexcerptfromtheleadarticleofthat

This passage would make you think that American capitalism would
notexistmuchlonger.Thementionofthe1920s,whichsawthestockmar-
ket crash of 1929, does not exactly conjure up bullish images. Additional
commentaryfromthatissuementionsthat“withnoevidenceofarebound
in investment, any hint of a flagging consumer suggests that the recov-
ery will be weak at best, and certainly not the robust boom that markets
countedonatthestartoftheyear.”14 Anotherarticlefromthesameissue
statesthat“nowshouldbethetimeforstockmarketstoroaraheadagain.
Instead,sharepricescontinuetoslip”andthat“thebullmarketwisdomof
always buying ‘on the dips’ might seem to apply. Yet this summer—and
possibly for some seasons to come—the wisdom may not be borne
out.”15
One“reason”forstayingawayfromequities,accordingtothisarticle,
was“sluggishprofits.”Thewriterlaterexclaimsthat“profitsareatthefront
of investors’ minds” and that “firms are finding that corporate profits are
rising rather more slowly, if at all.” The contrarian knows that profits are
not at the front of investors’ minds—fear is. A bearish magazine cover is

Thesubtitlefortheleadarticle,“AnEconomySinged,”was“Themar-
kets’ mood reflects a poor outlook for America’s economy.” A more ac-
curate subtitle would have been “The markets’ mood indicates that stock

It is December 2007 as I write this book and the EURUSD hit a
high of 1.4967 on November 23. Guess what? The December 1 issue of
The Economist features the U.S. dollar yet again. An image of George
Washingtoninanairplanethatisgoingdowninflamesisonthecoverwith
the title, “The panic about the dollar.” The day that this cover hit news-
stands, the EURUSD rate closed at 1.4744 in New York dealing. Today is

fessors from the University of Richmond, Virginia, conducted a study in
ordertodeterminewhether positivecover storiesareassociated withsu-
perior future performance and whether negative stories are associated
with inferior future performance regarding specific corporations. “Supe-
riorandinferiorweredeterminedincomparisonwithanindexoranother
companyinthesameindustryandofthesamesize.”Over2,000coversto-
ries were compiled from Business Week, Fortune, and Forbes over a 20-
year period (1982–2002) and divided into five categories: 1 for definitely
positive, 2 for positive/optimistic, 3 for neutral, 4 for negative, and 5 for
definitely negative. Of the 2,080 cover stories, 549 focused on a specific
corporation. Of the 549 stories, 350 were definitely positive and 100 were
definitely negative. This is almost certainly due to the fact that the
1982–2002periodwasabullmarketforstocks.Theprofessorsfoundthat

The specific examples that I cited along with the statistical tests per-
formed by the professors from the University of Virginia are proof that

multiyearturns.Themorerecentmagazinecoversdedicatedtothegreen-

The magazine cover is the result of a sentiment extreme, which is
expressed through other media outlets as well. The number of articles

Like the public, the media is always wrong about the direction of fi-
nancial markets at the turn. Robert Prechter describes why in The Wave
PrincipleofHumanSocialBehavior:
Reporters are usually nonprofessional in the fields that they cover,
so the feelings of reporters in general mirror those of the public. Re-
porters often contact financial analysts who express their own feel-
ings about markets, thus reflecting society’s consensus feelings. A
bullish analyst rarely gets a forum at a major market bottom, and
a bear rarely gets one at a major market top. The media’s choice of
timestoquotecertainprofessionalstypicallyshowsthoseprofession-
alsretrospectivelyintheirworstlight.17

use the actual headline as an exit strategy and wait for a higher probabil-

conditions are volatile. Also, if the market is at a multiweek/month/year

place my stop?” unless of course you are familiar with the wave princi-
ple (see Chapter 7). Additional timing tools such as pivot points can also
beused.

he charts in Chapter 2 of various economic indicators plotted with
the USD Index (DXY) show that there is absolutely no relationship
betweenanyoneeconomicindicatorandtheU.S.dollar.
Critics will argue that you cannot use just one economic indicator.
They will say that you have to look at a number of indicators and under-
stand the big picture. The problem with this approach is that most eco-

rately forecasting one economic number with another economic number

Others will argue that economic numbers do play a role but that a
host of other variables are also important, such as war, the price of com-
modities(oilorgold,forexample),andBlackSwaneventsasdescribedby

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission), an
independent agency with powers greater than those of its predeces-
sor agency, the Commodity Exchange Authority. For example, while
the Commodity Exchange Authority only regulated agricultural com-
modities enumerated in the Commodity Exchange Act, the 1974 act
granted the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over futures trading in all
commodities.
CURRENCY FUTURES HISTORY
Following the collapse of Bretton Woods, a group of commodity traders
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) naturally wanted to take
advantage of free floating currencies by trading in them. Unfortunately
for them, they did not have access to the inter-bank market. Refusing to
give up and possibly miss big profits by not trading in the new arena, the
group of traders established the International Monetary Market (IMM),
which is now a division of the CME. On May 16, 1972, seven currency
futures contracts began trading as the first financial futures. Previously
limited to large commercial banks and their corporate customers, now
individuals, investment funds, governments, and just about anyone else
could buy and sell currencies for future delivery or cash settlement. Of
course, anyone who opens a forex trading account with a forex dealer
member has access to the spot market today. Tighter spreads, 24-hour
trading, and customizable leverage are just some of the benefits that the
forexmarketenjoysovercurrencyfutures.
ABOUTTHECOT(abstractedfromwww.cftc.gov)
The Commitments of Traders (COT) reports can be traced back
to 1924. In that year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Grain
Futures Administration (predecessor to the USDA Commodity Ex-
change Authority, in turn the predecessor to the CFTC), published
its first comprehensive annual report of hedging and speculation in
regulatedfuturesmarkets.
Beginning as of June 30, 1962, COT data were published each
month. Those original reports then were compiled on an end-of-
month basis and published on the 11th or 12th calendar day of the
followingmonth.
Over the years, the CFTC has improved the Commitments of
Traders reports in several ways as part of its continuing effort to
betterinformthepublicaboutfuturesmarkets.
(cid:1)
The COT report ispublished more often—switching tomid-month
andmonth-endin1990,toeverytwoweeksin1992,andweeklyin
2000.

The report also is more widely available—moving from a

1993, and, beginning in 1995, becoming freely available on
www.cftc.gov.

you know what you’re looking at. The COT reports contain much more
information than just open interest and commercial and non-commercial
positioning, but these three numbers are the meat of the report and are
what I analyze. You can find more details at www.cftc.gov, such as the
definitionsbelow.
OpenInterest
Open interest is the total of all futures and/or option contracts en-
teredintoandnotyetoffsetbyatransaction,bydelivery,byexercise,
etc.Theaggregateofalllongopeninterestisequaltotheaggregateof
allshortopeninterest.
CommercialandNon-CommercialTraders
When an individual reportable trader is identified to the Com-
mission, the trader is classified either as “commercial” or “non-
commercial.” All of a trader’s reported futures positions in a com-
modity are classified as commercial if the trader uses futures
contracts in that particular commodity for hedging. To ensure
that traders are classified with accuracy and consistency, Com-
mission staff may exercise judgment in re-classifying a trader
if it has additional information about the trader’s use of the
markets.
Atradermaybeclassifiedasacommercialtraderinsomecom-
modities and as a non-commercial trader in other commodities.
A single trading entity cannot be classified as both a commercial
and non-commercial trader in the same commodity. Nonetheless, a
multi-functionalorganizationthathasmorethanonetradingentity
may have each trading entity classified separately in a commodity.
For example, a financial organization trading in financial futures
mayhaveabankingentitywhosepositionsareclassifiedascommer-
cialandhaveaseparatemoney-managemententitywhosepositions

For example, Toyota’s headquarters are based in Japan, but the com-
pany manufactures a lot of cars in the United States. Toyota needs to ex-
change Japanese yen for U.S. dollars in order to pay U.S. employees in
dollars. An entire new risk to the bottom line—currency risk—enters the

Remember, commercial traders in the currency arena such as banks
and multinational corporations are hedgers and have enormously deep
pockets. With each tick higher in price, the hedger is selling in order to
hedge against a decline in price. The more price increases, the more the
hedger sells in order to obtain a higher average sell price. The result of

The errors of optimism and pessimism that Pigou referenced (refer
back to Chapter 1 for the full quote) are clearly displayed in the charts
above. An uptrend is established and speculators add to long positions,
creating what can be described as a bullish sentiment extreme (error of
optimism)untilthemarketreverses.Tradersthensellaspricefalls,which
eventually leads to a bearish sentiment extreme (error of pessimism).

Applying Percentiles to Ratios
Obviously,thegoalistohaveCOTindicatorsthatarenotonlytimelybut
alsoreliable.OurarsenalincludestheCOTIndex(whichiscalculatedwith
the Composite COT) and the percent long ratio (speculative). I also look
at the percent long ratio (commercial). Remember, there are three main
characteristicsofCOTdatathatwarnofaturn.
1. The difference between speculative and commercial positioning is
large, usually the largest it has been in a certain period (13, 26, 52
weeks):COTIndexat0or100.
2. Speculativepositioningisthemostbullishatthetopandmostbearish

3. Commercialpositioningisthemostbearishatthetopandmostbullish

When these three things line up, the probability of a turn outweighs
theriskthatcomesfromgivingbackprofitsbystayinginthetrade.Inthis
instance,itiswisetokeeprisktightand/orexaminethechartforapossi-

The Power of
Technical
Indicators
T
he method that is referred to as technical analysis encompasses
a wide array of techniques, including moving averages, oscillators,
point and figure charting, candlesticks, time cycles, pivot points,
trendlines, traditional chart patterns such as the head and shoulders, and
tools derived from Fibonacci mathematics (which is the mathematical
foundation for Elliott wave analysis). I will cover just a few of these in-
dicators. There are so many indicators, and many new traders feel over-
whelmed when it comes to deciding what technical tools to use for their
trading. Technical analysis is only valuable if the person using it is disci-
plined. Once you develop a trading method robust enough that you feel
comfortable risking real money, it is imperative to be consistent and stay
withthatstrategyuntilfurtheranalysissuggestsotherwise.Exploringand
testing new methods is always important, but hastily changing your trad-
ingstylebecauseofafewbadtradesdestroystheadvantagethattechnical
analysis provides inthe firstplace. That advantage is objectivity. The fol-

Flip-flopping back and forth between technical methods is just as
badastradingbasedonbackwardlookingfundamentals.Neithermethod
leadstosuccess.Thebiggestproblemwithbothislackofconsistencyand
objectivity. I recently came across an article from Reuters titled “Stocks
anddollarfallaseconomy,earningssour.”Thefirstsentenceofthatarticle
is “Stocks slipped and the dollar fell on Thursday after another batch of
weak data suggested the economy faces further weakness.” Three days
earlier, a Thomson Financial article was titled “Dollar recovers against
euro as investors turn to safe haven currencies.” The first sentence of
that article was “The dollar recovered firmly against the euro as falls in
equity markets prompted investors to turn to safe-haven currencies.” To
summarize: On Monday, the dollar rallied and stocks fell because of a
slowing economy. On Thursday, the dollar fell and stocks fell because of
a slowing economy. There is nothing consistent or objective about that
analysis nor is there anything consistent or objective about switching
technicaltradingmethodsonawhim.

KEEP IT SIMPLE
Oneproblemthattraders,especiallynewtraders,faceisthatthereareso
many indicators to use. Which ones should you use? Many free charting
packages include at least a dozen or more indicators, and paid packages
include many more. The charting package that I use provides hundreds
of already programmed technical indicators. Traditionally, indicators are
classified as either trending or range. Moving averages are often consid-
ered to work better in trending markets and oscillators such as RSI, and
stochasticsareconsideredtoworkbetterinrangeboundmarkets.Techni-
calindicatorsarejustapieceofthepuzzle,alongwithsentimentindicators

WHAT TIME FRAMES TO USE?
A study of price data, technical analysis can be classified as a statistical
study. Any statistician will tell you that the results become more reliable
asmoredataisincludedinthestudy.Inourcase,theresultisfutureprice

An hourly chart will yield more reliable signals than a minute chart since
the hourly chart includes much more data than a minute chart. Similarly,
a daily chart will yield more reliable signals than an hourly chart, and a
monthly chart will be more reliable than a daily, and so on. With this in
mind,Ifindextremelyshort-termcharts,whichIconsideranythingunder

Also, short-term trading increases the risk of making emotionally
based decisions. For example, a swing trader risking 100 pips on a 1 lot
trade is risking the same amount as a scalp trader risking 10 pips on 10
lots.Asidefromthefactthatthescalper’smarginforerrorisfarless,the

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

nical analysis: support and resistance. Support is an area below the mar-

helpanswer.
Moving Averages
Moving averages are the most widely used technical indicators and prob-
ably the simplest to understand. There are different kinds of moving av-
erages but the most common are the simple moving average (SMA) and
the exponential moving average (EMA). An SMA is just the average of a
specifiedbodyofdata.Forexample,a10-periodSMAisthesumofthelast
10prices(usuallyclosingprices)dividedby10.
The calculation for an EMA is much more complicated. Some techni-
ciansprefertheEMAtotheSMA,arguingthatitdecreaseslagtimebecause
itassignsmoreweighttothemostrecentprice.AlthoughtheSMAusesjust
thenumberofperiodsspecifiedinitscalculation,theEMAusesallofthe
dataonthechart(ifyouareusinga10-dayEMAandlookingatathree-year
chart,allthreeyearsofdatawillbeinthatEMA).Howdoesthiswork?As
mentioned,theEMAcalculationismorecomplicatedthanthatoftheSMA.
EMA(current)=EMA(previous)+SmoothingFactor
×(Price−EMA[previous])
SmoothingFactor =2÷(1+n)
n=periods
Ifn=10,thenthemultiplier=2÷11=.181818.
SincethecurrentEMAiscalculatedfromthepreviousEMA,whichis
calculated from the previous EMA, which is calculated from the previous
EMA, and so on, every price on the chart is included in the current EMA.
OlderpriceshavelessofaneffectonthecurrentEMAthannewerprices
do, but they do have an effect, nonetheless. The calculation is similar to
the passing down of genes in a family. My genes are very similar to my
parents,lesssimilartomygrandparents,andevenlesssimilartomygreat
grandparents(butthereisasimilaritynonetheless),andsoon.

weight is given to the most recent prices. As a result, the EMA provides
quicker signals, but this can also lead to more false signals. Is the payoff

Pivot Points
Aspreviouslymentionedinthischapter,tradingrequiresreferencepoints
(supportandresistance)fromwhichtoenterthemarket,placestops,and
take profits. One tool that actually provides potential support and resis-
tance and therefore helps minimize risk is the pivot point and its deriva-
tives.Originallyemployedbyfloortradersonequityandfuturesexchanges,
pivot points have proved exceptionally useful in the FX market. Pivot
points can be calculated for any time frame. The previous period’s prices
areusedtocalculatethepivotpointforthenextperiod,asfollows:
Pivotpointforcurrent=high(previous)+low(previous)
+close(previous)÷3

On a log scale, price change is plotted as a percentage rather than an ab-
solute number. On an arithmetic scale, a movement of 1 to 2 is the same
as a movement of 10 to 11. Going from 1 to 2 is a 100 percent change, or
doubling in price. Going from 10 to 11 is just a 10 percent change. On a

What does this have to do with an indicator? If you are measuring
momentum in absolute terms, then you would conclude that a EURUSD
rally from 1.0000 to 1.1000 is the same as a EURUSD rally from 1.3000
to 1.4000. The former move was 10 percent and the latter move was
7.7 percent. A momentum indicator displays these two moves as being
equal (1,000 pips) when in reality they are not. On the other hand, a rate

at a slower rate of change. In other words, momentum slows but direc-
tion does not. In an uptrend, the result is a series of higher highs in price
but lower highs in momentum. In a downtrend, the result is a series of
lower lows in price but higher lows in momentum. What I have just de-
scribed is divergence (price and indicator diverge). Bearish divergence
occurs at market tops, and bullish divergence occurs at market bottoms.

The next example (see Figure 6.16 again) is also of the EURUSD but
from the bullish side. The decline that began at 1.3666 ended at 1.1640
in November 2005. On May 3, 2006, the 13-day EURUSD rate of change
stood at 4.30. This was the highest reading since December 2003. The
May 3rd closing price was 1.2630. Much like the previous example, many
tradersprobablytriedtofadethemomentumextremeonlytoseetherally
extend to 1.2970 by May 15th. As it turned out, the momentum extreme
in May 2006 was the kickoff for the EURUSD rally that would eventually
challenge1.5000.
I have used the term momentum extreme a lot, so a definition is
in order. A momentum extreme occurs when rate of change is greatest
(plus or minus) over a specified amount of time. The amount of time
specified and the power of the signal are directly correlated. In other
words,athree-yearmomentumextremeismorepowerfulthanaone-year
momentum extreme. Of course, this technique can be applied to any
time frame. For example, a 120-hour rate of change covers five days.
In this instance, you are looking for a five-day momentum extreme in
ordertodetermineabias.Ifusingmomentumtotradereversals,thenthe
momentumextrememustbemadeinthedirectionoppositethepreceding
trend.Forexample,Figure6.17isoftheUSDCADdailychartwith13-day
rate of change. The pair had clearly been in a downtrend for some time,
but a momentum extreme was made on November 6, 2007. This is not a
signal to get bearish USDCAD, because the USDCAD had been declining
for some time. However, notice that a bullish momentum extreme was
madeonNovember 23rd.Thisisavalidreversalsignalsincetheextreme

As you can see, the calculation is far more complex than simply rate
of change or momentum. Instead of simply dropping the last data point
(n + 1) in the calculation, Wilder developed RS (relative strength). Think
back to the exponential moving average equation and the family analogy.
ThecurrentRSusesthepreviousaveragegainandaveragelossinitscalcu-
lation. Each previous RS uses the average gain and average loss previous
to it. You get the picture. RS is a rolling, continuous calculation. In the-
ory, all of the data in the history of the instrument has an effect on the
current RS reading. In reality, the effect of price changes from far back
diminishes as time progresses to the point that the price changes are not
noticeable.Inanycase,theresultisasmootherlinethanifthecalculation

Manydonotpayattentiontothe50line,butIfindituseful.Muchlike
rate of change above 0 or below 0 indicates a bullish or bearish bias, RSI
above 50 or below 50 indicates a bullish or bearish bias. Wilder recom-
mendedlabelingamarketasoverboughtwhenRSIadvancedabove70and

toatleastpullback.Whileatraditionalsellsignaldoesnotactuallyoccur
until RSI drops back below 70 (a traditional buy signal when RSI crosses

Overbought and Oversold Is Erroneous
Theconceptofoverboughtandoversoldinthetraditionalsenseisflawed.
Overbought and oversold could just as easily be termed strong uptrend
andstrongdowntrend.Sure,priceeventuallyreachesapeakortroughand
turns,butnotafterremainingoverboughtoroversoldforanextendedpe-
riod of time. The strongest trends (the ones that we as traders want to
ride for as long as possible) can remain overbought or oversold, as the
terms are defined in the traditional sense, for weeks or longer on daily
charts.
MostnovicetraderswillnotethattheRSIindicatorisabove70;there-
fore, price is overbought and the correct decision is to sell. Oftentimes,
the correct and therefore profitable decision is to do the exact opposite.
The chart in Figure 6.19 is a weekly plot of the EURUSD. The bold bars
indicate that 13-week RSI is below 30 or above 70. In nearly all of the in-
stances, RSI moving above 70 was much closer to the beginning of a bull

As with any technical tool, RSI crosses above or below a specific
level are not to be taken as blind signals. Rather, use the cross to deter-
mine a bias. For example, once RSI is above 60 on the weekly chart, buy
intra-week weakness by placing orders near the calculated weekly pivot
supports.

analysis.
LaneactuallystudiedElliottwavetheoryhimselfandadvocatedusing
his stochastic indicator in conjunction with Elliott. What is interesting is
the name that Lane chose for his indicator: stochastic. Stochastic means
“randomness”and“unpredictability.”AnypractitionerofElliottknowsthat
markets are not random, but follow a basic form (which we will get to
later). Probabilities can be predicted but are not certainties; in this way,

Signals can be generated using crossovers. If %K crosses above %D,
then a buy signal is generated. If %K crosses below %D, then a sell sig-

20 designate overbought and oversold. One reason the stochastic oscilla-
tor is more sensitive an indicator than RSI, which is why the overbought

Lane himself advocated using his indicator primarily to spot diver-
gences in order to anticipate reversals (in conjunction with Elliott). As
was mentioned previously, divergence does warn that the probability of
thetrendcontinuingisnotashighasprevious,butdivergencecanremain
inplaceforalongtime.Theresultisthattraderstrytosellthetoporbuy

tremeterritory,takeadvantageofthetrendbyremainingwithitinsteadof

The results are promising. If you compare Figure 6.24 to Figure 6.19,
you’ll notice that the stochastic oscillator signals the change in trend
quicker than the RSI. The drawback though is that there are more false
signals.RSIsignalsthefirstdowntrendintheEURUSDinMarch1999.The
stochasticoscillatorsignalsthedowntrendtwomonthsearlierinJanuary
1999. The RSI does not switch to a bullish bias until June 2002 but the
stochastic oscillator gives a false buy signal in October 1999 before re-
verting back to a bearish bias the next month. From October 2000 until
February2002,theEURUSDtradedinarange.WithRSI,yourbiaswould
haveremainedbearishduringthisrangeboundperiod.Withthestochastic
oscillator, your bias would have changed multiple times. This is not nec-
essarily a bad thing. The stochastic oscillator is more sensitive than RSI
and therefore changes bias more often. This leads to earlier and timelier
signals but also more false signals. Finding the correct balance between
timelinessandreliabilityisessentialtosuccessintechnicalanalysis.Asis

JohnBollingerdevelopedBollingerbandsintheearly1980s.Thefollowing

The purpose of Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of
high and low. By definition prices are high at the upper band and
lowatthelowerband.
MiddleBollingerBand=20-periodsimplemovingaverage
Upper Bollinger Band = Middle Bollinger Band + 2 * 20-period

Lower Bollinger Band = Middle Bollinger Band – 2 * 20-period

Fibonacci), then I urge you to read the books listed in the Notes section
at the back of the book. An experienced Elliottician has at his or her dis-

WHO WAS ELLIOTT?
Ralph Nelson Elliott was a successful accountant early in the twentieth
century and “held executive positions primarily with railroad companies
in Mexico and Central America.” His success in turning around troubled
rail companies attracted the attention of the U.S. State Department, and
in 1924 the department “chose him to become the Chief Accountant for
Nicaragua, which was under the control of the U.S. marines at the time.”

Elliott moved to Guatemala City after the United States extricated itself
from Nicaragua to take on the position of general auditor of the Interna-
tional Railway of Central America. While in Central America in the late
1920s, Elliott contracted an “alimentary tract illness caused by the organ-
ismamoebahistolytica.”2
At58yearsofage,theformeraccountantwasverysickandconfined
tohishome.Hismindalwaysatwork(hehadwrittentwobooks),Elliott
dedicated his time to studying the price behavior of the Dow Jones Aver-
ages.Elliottstudiedmanytimeframes,from30minutetoyearly.Thismust
havebeenquiteanarduoustaskgiventhatchartswereplottedbyhandon
graphpaperthen.
Elliottdiscoveredthatpriceactiondisplayedondifferenttimeframes
formed the same basic patterns. In other words, there is a market form
at all degrees of trend. The basic pattern that Elliott discovered was that
a market cycle consists of eight waves, five waves with the trend and
three waves against the trend. Within the five waves, waves 1, 3, and 5
are in the direction of the trend while waves 2 and 4 are against the
trend,orcorrectionsofthetrend.Wave2correctswave1andwave4cor-
rects wave 3. Following the completion of five waves in one direction, a
larger correction takes place in three waves. The basic 5–3 pattern forms
the foundation from which everything else is a part. Figure 7.1 shows
the basic pattern of five waves with the trend and three waves against
thetrend.

ExplanationofElliottWaveandFibonacci 153
Fractal Nature of Markets
Elliott discovered that price action exhibited the same basic patterns re-
gardless of time frame. The patterns come together to form similar but
larger patterns. For example, the patterns on the 30-minute chart link to-
gether to form similar patterns on the daily chart, which link together to
form similar patterns on a monthly chart. This idea, that the patterns are
thesameregardlessoftimeframe,wouldcometobeknownasfractal.The
term fractal was actually coined by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975 and is de-
scribedbyhimas“aroughorfragmentedgeometricshapethatcanbesub-
divided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size
copy of the whole.”3 The word is derived from the Latin fractus meaning
“broken” or “fractured.” Although termed by Mandelbrot, Elliott had dis-
coveredalmost50yearsearlierthatfinancialmarketsarefractalinnature.
In this sense, the wave principle is not just a trading and forecasting tool
butalsoa“detaileddescriptionofhowmarketsbehave”4Thefractalnature
ofmarketsisillustratedinFigure7.2.
Elliottalsofoundthesamerecurringpatternsonthechartsregardless
of the market that he was studying. If different markets are supposed to
react to different news stories and events, then why would the different
markets exhibit the same patterns? The only answer is that freely traded
financial markets are not influenced by outside forces but are instead

describeddiagonalsasoccurringwhen“theprecedingtrendhasgonetoo
far too fast.”6 In a diagonal, wave 4 often does overlap wave 1 although
this is not a requirement. Whereas a diagonal does consist of five waves
and wave 3 cannot be the shortest wave, each of the five waves consists
of three waves. The most common type of diagonal is a contracting one,
in which two lines converge, like a diagonal triangle. The name diagonal
originatedfromthistendency.TheothertypeofdiagonalthatElliottwrote
aboutwasanexpandingdiagonal;whichisextremelyrare.Thepatternthat
formsfromthepriceaction(seeFigures7.10,7.11,and7.12)isareflection

With this in mind, think about why an expanding triangle is rare. Di-
agonal or not, triangles reflect a balance of bullish and bearish forces
that creates a low volatility environment. In contrast, volatility increases
in an expanding triangle or diagonal. It is rare indeed for volatility to in-
creasedespiteasidewaystrend(whichbringsupthepointthattrenddoes

The Ending Diagonal Reversal
Although the 1–2 Base setup often presents the most profitable opportu-
nities, trading the ending diagonal reversal is probably my favorite setup.
Themovefollowinganendingdiagonalisjustasfastasathirdwave,and

tience is required when attempting to catch a third wave because price

An ending diagonal is referred to as a wedge by traditional chartists.
Ending diagonals are fairly common. In fact, you should expect an end-

Again, I enter in halves. Enter the first half of the position where the
line that is extended from waves 1 and 3 intersects with price. Enter the
second half of the position on a break of the line that is extended from
waves 2 and 4. Ending diagonals are usually fully retraced, so the profit

if you simply wish to add to your position on a pullback, then an optimal

waves are often more shallow than second waves. If wave 2 is a zigzag,
then wave 4 will most likely unfold as either a flat or a triangle (the ten-
dency for two corrective waves in a five wave impulse to be different in
character,onedeepandoneshallow,isknownasalternation).Again,the
most important aspect is form, but Fibonacci relationships among waves
of the same degree help with timing. Wave 4 will most commonly retrace
roughly 38.2 percent of wave 3 (Figure 7.25). A stop is placed below the

Wave C of a Flat Correction
Wave C of a flat correction (or any correction, for that matter) is al-
ways an impulse. If the final leg of a correction is not an impulse, then

Regarding the U.S. dollar, the peak in 1985 appears to have formed
after an impulse that sported an extended fifth wave. Did the U.S. dollar

If the COT indicators are not yet extreme, then the trend will likely con-

If you see a clear Elliott wave pattern, then you will have a good idea as

for an opportunity elsewhere. When the measures confirm one another,
exploittheopportunity.
