Preface
T
his may come as a surprise, but I don’t really think of myself as a
writer.Ithinkofmyselfasamarketanalystwhowritesaboutthings
thatIseeoncharts.Fortunately,I’veachievedsomesuccessinboth
fields. My first book, Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets (New
York Institute of Finance/Prentice Hall, 1986) was described by many as
the bible of technical analysis and was translated into a half dozen lan-
guages.AsecondeditionwaspublishedunderthetitleTechnicalAnalysis
of the Financial Markets (Prentice Hall, 1999) and, as the newer titleim-
plies, broadened its coverage to include all financial markets. I authored
IntermarketTechnicalAnalysis(JohnWiley&Sons,1991)whichwasde-
scribedasalandmarkpublicationsinceitwasthefirstbooktoemphasize
linkagesbetweenfinancialmarketsandassetclasses.Asecondeditionof
thatbook,IntermarketAnalysis(JohnWiley&Sons,2004)waspublished
12yearslater.
ThefirsteditionofTheVisualInvestor(JohnWiley&Sons,1996)was
myfavoriteofthebookswrittenthusfar—andstillis.Whilemyothertwo
books were written primarily for market professionals, or investors with
somedegreeofchartingexperience,The Visual Investorwasforthegen-
eralpublicwithlittleornochartingexperience.Thegenesisforthebook
came while I was the technical analyst for CNBC. I usually had three or
four short segments on the air each day to discuss some aspect of the fi-
nancial markets. And I used a lot of charts. Unfortunately, there wasn’t a
lot of time to explain how the charts were constructed and exactly how
to interpret them. I received an awful lot of mail from viewers asking me
to explain what all the lines on the charts meant. The first edition of The
VisualInvestorwasmyanswertoallofthoseviewerrequests.
We decided to call the book The Visual Investor for a couple of rea-
sons. What I did on TV (and still do in my market commentary) is show
pictures of markets in much the same way that meteorologists look at
weather maps. It’s all visual. There was no point calling it anything else.
Besides, a lot of people are intimidated by the term “technical analysis.”

xvi PREFACE
it really was in an attempt to get more people to consider this valuable
formofmarketanalysiswithoutalltheunnecessarytechnicalbaggageand
jargon.
IalsostartedcallingwhatIdidvisual analysistolessenthefearfac-
torof TV producers who seemed terrifiedby thesubject (despite thefact
that TV is a visual medium). It seems like every TV story has some chart
attached to it these days. It still seems, however, that TV producers are
reluctant to interview someone who actually knows how to read a chart.
They’llaskeconomists,securityanalysts,andsometimesoneoftheirown
commentatorswhatthechartsmean.Theyseemreluctant,however,toask
acard-carryingchartanalyst(yes,professionalchartistsnowcarrycards).
Theyseemafraidthatwouldbe“tootechnical”forthemortheiraudience.
That’sprobablyjustaswellbecauseyoudon’tneedtowatchTVtofindout
whatmarketsaregoingupandwhicharegoingdown.Oneofthepurposes
of this second edition is to convince you that you’re perfectly capable of
doing your own visual analysis of the various financial markets. And it’s
notashardasyoumightthink.
Oneofthethingsthathappenstomostmarketveteransovertheyears
isthattheytendtosimplifytheirwork.Partofthereasonforthatmaysim-
ply be lack of energy as one gets older. I prefer to think of the tendency
to simplify things as a sign of experience and, hopefully, some increased
maturityandwisdom.WhenIfirststartedmycareerasachartist40years
ago, I studied (and tried to apply) every technical tool and theory that I
found.Believeme,therewerealotofthem.Atonetimeoranother,Istud-
iedandusedvirtuallyeveryoneofthem.AndIfoundsomevalueineach
one of them. As my intermarket work forced me to broaden my horizon
to include all financial markets all over the world, however, there simply
wasn’t time to perform in-depth chart analysis on each and every one of
them(especiallywithasmanyas80technicalindicatorsinsomecharting
packages). Then I found something else out. It wasn’t really necessary to
dosoanyway.Allonereallyneedstodoisfindoutwhichmarketsarerising
andwhichonesaren’t.It’sreallyassimpleasthat.
On an average day, I scan hundreds of financial markets. I don’t nec-
essarilylookateachcharthowever.Wenowhavescreeningtools(which
I’ll show you later) that help us to quickly determine which markets are
risingandwhichonesarefalling.Withinthestockmarket,forexample,we
can usually tell ataglance which market sectors and industry groups are
the strongest and which ones are the weakest on any given day. We can
then look to see which individual stocks are driving those groups higher
or lower. Only after we’ve uncovered the leaders (or laggards) do we ac-
tuallylookatthecharts.Wecandothesameforforeignstocksandother
financial markets such as bonds, commodities, and currencies. The Inter-
netmakesallofthateasytodo.

Oneadvantageofscanningsomanymarketsisthatitgivesmeafeeling
forthebigpicture.Sinceallfinancialmarketsarelinkedinsomefashion,
it’shelpfultogetasenseofwhatthemainthemeis.Risingstockprices,for
example, are usually associated with falling bond prices. A falling dollar
usually coincides with rising commodities and stocks tied to those com-
modities. Strong foreign markets usually signal a higher U.S. market and
vice versa. A strong stock market usually favors economically sensitive
stock groups like technology and transportation. In a weaker market, de-
fensivegroupssuchasconsumerstaplesandhealthcareusuallydobetter.
Nomarkettradesinavacuum.Traderswholookatonlyahandfulofmar-
kets miss out on valuable information. By the time you finish this book,

ThesecondeditionofThe Visual Investorfollowsthesamethemeas

whatvisualanalysisisallabout.Knowingwhyamarketisgoingupordown
is interesting, but not crucial. The media is full of people telling you why

isalsofullofpeopletellingyouwhatthemarketsshouldbedoing.Allthat
mattersiswhatthemarketsareactuallydoing.Visualanalysisisthebest
waytodeterminethat.Andthat’swhatthisbookisallabout.
Asyoubegintounderstand theprinciplesofvisualanalysis,youmay
notice an increase in your own sense of self-reliance. You may find that
you don’t really need to listen to all those analysts and economists who
like to explain why the markets did what they did yesterday (which they
didn’t know or didn’t bother tell you about the day “before” yesterday).
You’ll begin to realize that all those financial “experts” aren’t that expert
after all. Remember all those experts who didn’t see the housing bubble
bursting in 2007 until it was too late. Or those experts who assured us
that the subprime mortgage mess wasn’t all that serious in summer 2007.
Even the Federal Reserve Board kept insisting during the second half
of 2007 that the economy was in fine shape and inflation was well con-
tained. While they were saying that, the stock market and the U.S. dollar
werefallingwhilebondpricesandcommoditieswererising—arecipefor
stagflation.Bythemiddleof2008,theFedadmittedthatitwastryingtobat-

Acknowledgments
I
n the first edition of this book, I recommended that an investor have
charting software and access to an online data service to perform vi-
sual analysis. Thanks to the increasing number of Internet resources,
all one needs now is a good charting website, which eliminates the need
for a separate data service. In other words, all you need to do is log on
and start charting. One such charting service is StockCharts.com. As the
chief technical analyst (and part owner) for that award-winning site, I’ve
had some say in its development. Needless to say, I’m very proud of the
result.Allofthecharts(andvisualtools)inthisbookaretakenfromthat
website. I’d like to thank Chip Anderson, president of StockCharts.com,

Introduction

raders and investors have been using a visual approach to investing
foroveracentury.Upuntilthepastdecade,theuseofvisualanalysis
asaseriousmethodoftradingandinvestingwasprettymuchlimited
toprofessionalsandfull-timetraders.Mostsuccessfultraderswouldnever
thinkofmakingatradewithoutfirstconsultingthepicturesontheircharts.
EventheFederalReserveBoardnowusespricecharts.
WHAT HAS CHANGED?
For the average investor, however, the world of visual trading had been
largelyclosed.Theintimidatingjargonandcomplicatedformulaswerebe-
yond the reach and, indeed, the interest of the nonprofessional investor.
A couple of important factors have changed that in the past decade. The
most important is the availability of inexpensive computers and Internet
chartingservices.Theinvestingpublicnowhasanimpressivearrayoftech-
nologicalandvisualtoolsthatweren’tavailabletotheprofessionalcommu-
nity30yearsago.
Theseconddevelopmenthasbeenthedramaticexpansionofthemu-
tualfundindustrytothepointwheremoremutualfundsexistthanstocks
now traded on the New York Stock Exchange. This phenomenal growth

made the task of the individual investor more difficult. The original pur-
pose of mutual funds was to simplify investing. If someone didn’t have
the time or expertise to pick stocks, that task could be turned over to a
mutualfundmanager.Besidesprofessionalmanagement,instantdiversifi-
cation was provided. An investor could buy one fund and be in the mar-
ket. Now, however, mutual funds are so segmented that the investor has
a bewildering set of choices to make. In the past decade, the arrival of
exchange-tradedfunds(ETFs)hasreplacedmanymutualfundchoices.
FUND CATEGORIES
Domestic stock funds are categorized by goal and style—aggressive
growth, growth, growth and income, and equity income. Funds are
also divided by the size or capitalization of the stocks included in their
portfolios. Large-cap stock funds limit their portfolios to those stocks
included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Midsize funds focus
onstocksincludedintheS&P400Mid-CapIndexortheWilshireMid-Cap
750.Small-cap fundschoosetheirportfoliosfromtheRussell2000orthe
S&P 600 Small-Cap Index. Stock funds can be further identified by their
specializationinvariousstockmarketsectors,suchasTechnology, Basic
Industry,HealthCare,FinancialServices,Energy,PreciousMetals,and
Utilities.Stocksectorscanbefurthersubdividedintoindustrieswitheven
morespecifiedfunds.TheTechnologysector,forexample,wouldinclude
funds that emphasize computers, defense and aerospace, communica-
tions, electronics, software, semiconductors, and telecommunications.

Introduction 3
INVESTORS NEED TO BE BETTER
INFORMED
For many investors, fund investing has replaced individual stock selec-
tion.However,withthedegreeofsegmentationthathastakenplaceinthe
stock fund industry, investors have little choice but to become better in-
formedandmoreactivelyinvolvedinthefundselectionprocess.Investors
mustbeawareofwhatdifferentsectorsoftheAmericanmarketaredoing
aswellashowglobalmarketsarefaring.Thenumberofchoicesavailable
totheinvestorisamixedblessing.
So, too, are the technological advances of the past decade. The prob-
lem is knowing how to select and use the resources available. The tech-
nology has outpaced the public’s ability to use the new data in the most
efficient way. Which brings us to the purpose of this book—to help the
average investor quickly acclimate to visual trading; and then show how
these relatively simple principles can be applied to the problem of sector
investingprimarilythroughexchange-tradedfunds.
BENEFITS OF VISUAL INVESTING

funds also provide additional ways to diversify one’s core stock holdings

price and volume charts. Analysis of fundamental data, such as earnings
expectations and thestateof theeconomy, helps determine what astock
should be doing. Market analysis tells us what the stock actually is do-
ing.Thetwoapproachesareverydifferent.Theuseofearningsestimates

THE TREND IS TO BLEND
Thefactofthematteristhatmostsuccessfultradersandmoneymanagers
use some blend of the visual and the financial. The more recent trend is
toward a blending of the chart and fundamental disciplines. The use of
intermarket analysis,thestudyofmarket linkages(discussedinSection
Three), blurs the line between those two disciplines even further. The in-
tention here is simply to explain how the two approaches differ and in-

WHY STUDY THE MARKET?
Let’s suppose an investor has some money to invest in the stock market.
Thefirstdecisioniswhetherornotthisisagoodtimetoputnewfundsinto
themarket.Ifitis,whichsectorofthemarketwouldbemostsuitable?An
investor has to study the market in order to make an informed decision.
Thequestionishowtoaccomplishthattask.
An investor can read the newspapers, plow through a lot of earnings
reports,calluphisorherbrokeronthephone,orsubscribetosomefinan-
cialpublicationorwebsite.Allofthosethingsshouldprobablybedoneas
partoftheprocessanyway.Butthere’saquickerandeasierway:Insteadof
wonderingwhatthemarketshouldbedoing,whynotlookatwhatitisdo-
ing?Beginbystudyingthepricetrendofmajorstockaverages.Then,look
atthechartsofthevariousstocksectorstoseewhichwaythey’retrending.
Both steps can be accomplished in a matter of minutes by looking at the
appropriatechartpictures.
CHARTISTS ARE CHEATERS
In a way, using chart analysis is a form of cheating. After all, why does a
stock go up or down? It goes up because its fundamentals are bullish. It
goes down because its fundamentals are bearish. Or, at least, that is how
the market perceives a stock’s fundamentals. How many times have you
seenastockfallinpriceinthefaceofabullishpieceofnews?Whatmatters
isn’talwaystheactualnews,butwhatthemarketwasexpectingandwhat
itthinksofthatnews.
Why,then,ischartanalysischeating?Becauseitisashortcutformof
fundamental analysis. It enables a chartist to analyze a stock or industry
groupwithoutdoingalloftheworkofthefundamentalanalyst.Andhow
doesitdothat?Simplybytellingthechartistwhetherthefundamentalsof
a stock are bullish or bearish by the direction its price is moving. If the
market perceives the fundamentals as bullish, the stock will be rewarded
withahigherprice.Anegativemarketevaluationofastock’sinherentfun-
damental value will punish the stock by pushing its price lower. All the

ordown.Italmostseemslikecheating,butitreallyisn’t.It’sjustsmart.
IT’S ALWAYS JUST SUPPLY AND DEMAND
The simplest way to understand the difference between the two ap-
proaches is to consider supply and demand. Simple economics tells us

that when demand increases relative to supply, prices rise. When supply
exceedsdemand,pricesfall.Thesameprincipleappliestostocks,bonds,
currencies,andcommodities.However,howdoesonetellwhatthosesup-

CHARTS ARE JUST FASTER
An excellent example of the difference between the two approaches was
providedtomeearlyinmycareerasamarketanalyst.Ourportfolioman-
agercalledmeandafundamentalanalystintohisofficeonedayandgave
usboththesameassignment:toanalyzethehistoricvaluelevelsforalist
ofstocksthathewasconsideringpurchasingforthecompany’sinvestment

and which were at more reasonable historic levels and more suitable for
purchase.
I went back to my office and got out a long-term chart book showing
pricehistories,goingbackseveraldecades,foreachstock.Isimplynoted
thepricelevelswherethestockshadpeakedandtroughedinthepast,and
whichstocks wereclosest tothose peaks andtroughs. The entireproject

However, my report wasn’t submitted for another two weeks, which

When both lists were submitted, the funny thing was that we both came
up with essentially the same results. He had taken all of the fundamental
factors,includinghistoricprice/earningsratiosandthelike,intoconsidera-

pricehistoriesofthestocks.Wecameupwiththesamenumbers,butmy
task took two hours while his took two weeks. I learned two things from
that. First, both approaches often give us the same results, demonstrat-
ing the enormous overlap between the two. Second, the chart approach
is much quicker and doesn’t require much knowledge of the stocks in
question.
CHARTS DO LOOK AHEAD

themarket oftengoes intheopposite direction. The tendency ofmarkets
toleadfundamentaldataaccountsformostofthediscrepanciesbetween
thetwoapproaches.
PICTURES DON’T LIE
Since fundamentals are discounted in the market, market analysis is just
anotherformoffundamentalanalysis—amorevisualapproach,ifyouwill.

It also demonstrates why studying the market visually is such a vi-
tal part of the investing process. It suggests why fundamental analysis
shouldn’t be used in a vacuum. Market analysis can alert an investor to
changesinamarket’ssupply/demandequation,whichwouldthenprompt
a reevaluation of that market’s fundamentals. Or, market analysis can be
usedasacheckorfilteronfundamentalassessments.Eitherway,thereis
plentyofroomforbothdisciplinestocomplementeachother’sstrengths.
PICTURE ANYTHING YOU WANT
One of thegreatest strengths of the visual approach tomarket analysis is
its ability to monitor a large number of markets at the same time and to
cross over into other investment mediums. It is possible for an investor
to chart markets all over the world. Global stock and bond markets, for-
eigncurrencies,stocksectors,individualstocks,bonds,andcommodities
can easily be monitored. In addition, the principles of chart analysis can
beappliedtoanyandallofthosemarketswithlittleknowledgeofthere-

IT’S ALL ABOUT TREND
The second reason that charts work is that markets trend. If you don’t
believe it, look at the chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in

yourself is buy a stock that is falling. The existence of a downward trend

TIMING IS EVERYTHING
Thisfirstchapterintendsnotonlytoexplainhowthevisualapproachdif-
fers from traditional forms of financial analysis, but also to show how
they can be blended together. Consider the problem of timing: Suppose
yourfundamentalanalysisidentifiesastockthatappearsattractiveforpur-
chase. Do you just go in and purchase it? Maybe the analysis is right, but
thetimingiswrong.Insuchcases,theapplicationofsomebasiccharting

The point of this chapter is to present some of the philosophical ground
onwhichvisualchartanalysisisbasedandtodemonstratehowandwhyit

the visual approach is both appealing and compelling. At the same time,
itseemsworthwhileforanyonejustbeginningastudyofthisapproachto

Consider the plight of someone who doesn’t use any form of visual

isusuallyaconfirmationthatatrendreversalhasinfacttakenplace(see
Figure2.3).Adowntrendisjustamirrorimageofanuptrendandischar-
acterized by a series of declining peaks and troughs (see Figure 2.4). The
abilityofapricetoholdaboveapreviouslowpointfollowedbyanupside
penetration of a prior high point is necessary to signal a reversal of the
precedingdowntrend.
SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS
Fortunately,thesepeaksandtroughshavenamesthatareself-explanatory
(see Figure 2.5). Support refers to a reaction low, or trough, that was
formedsometimeinthepast.Analystsoftenspeakofpricesbouncingoff
asupportlevel.They’reusuallyreferringtonothingmorethanapriorlow
formed sometime in the last week, month, or year. Remember that sup-
port is always below the market. What the market does at that support is
very important. If the market closes below the support level (referred to
as breaking support), the downtrend is resumed. The ability of prices to
bounce off that support level (referred to as a successful test of support)
is usually the first sign that the downtrend is ending and that prices are
beginningtobottom.
Resistance is the name assigned to any previous peak. You may hear
analysts speak of prices approaching an overhead resistance level. They
aresimplyreferringtosomepricelevelatwhichapriorpeakwasformed.
The ability of prices to exceed that prior peak is critical. If prices close
above the peak, the uptrend is maintained. If prices back off again from
the prior peak, a warning signal is given of a possible trend failure (see
Figure2.6).Resistanceisabarrierabovethemarket.
ROLE REVERSAL
This is a market phenomenon that you should be aware of. After support
and resistance levels are penetrated by a reasonable amount, they often
reverse roles. In other words, a broken support level (prior bottom) be-
comesaresistancebarrierabovethemarket.Duringanuptrend,abroken
resistancelevel(priorpeak)usuallybecomesanewsupportlevelonsub-
sequent market corrections. Figure 2.7 shows how this happens. Market
analystslookforsupporttofunctionnearapriormarketpeak.Figure2.8

SHORT VERSUS LONG TERM
Manyinvestorsareconfusedbythetermsshorttermandlongterm,which
are so casually tossed around by market professionals. The distinction is
actuallyfairlysimple,butrequiresanunderstandingofthefactthatthere
are many different degrees of trend interacting with each other. A major
trend,asthenameimplies,referstoanimportanttrendthatlastsanywhere
fromsixmonthstoseveralyears.Whenanalystsspeakofthemajortrendof
thestockmarket,theyarereferringtothelonger-termtrendofthemarket,
which is the most important to stock investors. The major trend is also
calledtheprimarytrend.
The second most important trend is the secondary, or intermediate,
trend.Thisreferstoacorrectioninthemajortrendthatcanlastfromone
to six months. In other words, it is not long enough to qualify as a major
trend, but too long to be considered a short-term trend. The third degree
oftrendistheshort-term,orminor,trend.Thisusuallyreferstoacorrec-
tionorconsolidationphasethatlastslessthanamonthandismeasuredin
daysorweeks.Itusuallyrepresentsnothingmorethanapauseintheinter-
mediate or major trend. The short-term trend is generally of most impor-
tancetomarkettradersasopposedtoinvestors(seeFigures2.9and2.10).
Breaking down market trends into three categories is really an over-
simplification. There are an infinite number of trends to measure at any
one time, from an intraday chart showing hourly changes, to a 50-year
trend measured on annual charts. However, for purposes of convenience
and simplification, most analysts use some version of the three just men-
tioned.Bearinmindthatdifferentanalystsmayusedifferenttimeparam-
eters to determine trend significance. Some measure short-term trends in
days,intermediatetrendsinmonths,andmajortrendsinyears.Theprecise
definitionisn’tthatimportant.Whatisimportantisthatyouunderstandthe

For example, an analyst may be bullish on a stock, but bearish short
term.Thatsimplymeansthatalthoughthemostimportanttrend(themajor
trend)isstillup,thestockwillprobablyexperiencesomeshort-termdown-
wardpressure(oftencalledvolatility).Thismaymeandifferentthingsto

DAILY, WEEKLY, AND MONTHLY CHARTS
Anappreciationofwhateachtrendisdoingisimportant.Forthisreason,
it’s necessary to use price charts that monitor the different trends. In or-
der to gain a long-term perspective, monthly charts showing 10 years of
pricehistoryareagoodplacetostart.Weeklychartsthatcoveratleastfive
years are recommended to get a closer picture of the major trend. Daily
charts going back a year are necessary to study the shorter-term trends.

allybullishorbearishattitudeonamarket,dailychartsaremosthelpfulin

RECENT VERSUS DISTANT PAST
Time is important in market analysis. Generally speaking, the longer a
trend has been in motion, the more important it is. A five-day trend is
clearly not as significant as a five-month or a five-year trend. The same
istrueofsupportandresistancelevels,sincetheymeasurethosedifferent
degrees of trend. A support or resistance level that was formed a couple
of weeks ago is not nearly as important as one formed two years ago. As
a general rule, the further back in time that a support or resistance level
was formed, the more significant it becomes. As a second rule, the more
times a support or resistance level has been “tested,” the more important
itbecomes.Sometimesamarketwillbackofffromaresistancelevelthree
or four times. Clearly, any subsequent penetration of that barrier carries
much more significance. The number of times a price tests support or re-
sistanceisalsoimportantintheidentificationofpricepatterns,whichwill

determinewhenthattrendischanging.Althoughhorizontaltrendlinescan
be drawn on a chart, the most common usage refers to up trendlines and
downtrendlines.Anuptrendlineissimplydrawnundertherisingreaction

Once a valid trendline is drawn, markets will often bounce off it sev-
eraltimes.Forexample,inanuptrend,marketswilloftenpullbacktothe
up trendline and bounce off it. Retests of up trendlines often present ex-
cellent buying opportunities (see Figure 2.13). Prices in a downtrend will
oftenbouncebacktothefallingtrendline,presentingasellingopportunity.
Analystsoftenrefertotrendlinesupportandresistance.

bars.Someanalystsprefertoconnectonlytheclosingpricesinsteadofthe
individualpricebars.Forlonger-rangetrendanalysis,itdoesn’tmaketoo
much difference. For shorter-term analysis, I prefer connecting the tops
andbottomsoftheindividualpricebars.
Ittakestwopointstodrawaline.Anuptrendlinecan’tbedrawnun-
til two troughs are visible. Even then, the trendline is not necessarily a
validtrendline.Pricesshouldtestthetrendline,andbounceoffit,tocon-
firmthatthetrendlineisvalid.Preferably,pricesshouldtouchatrendline
three times. (Sometimes, however, the market isn’t as accommodating as
we would like and a trendline is touched only twice.) The more times a
trendline is tested, the more significant it becomes. Figure 2.14 shows a
long-termdowntrendlinebeingtouchedthreetimes.
Most analysts draw several lines on their charts. Sometimes the orig-
inal trendline proves to be incorrect, in which case a new trendline must
be drawn. Another reason for having several trendlines is that they mea-
suredifferenttrends.Somemeasuretheshort-termtrend,somethelonger
trend.Aswithtrendsthemselves,longer-termtrendlinescarrymoresignif-
icancethanshorter-termtrendlines(seeFigures2.13and2.14).

CHANNEL LINES
Channel lines are easily drawn on price charts and often help identify
support and resistance levels. Markets will often trend between two par-
alleltrendlines,oneaboveandonebelowthepriceaction.Duringadown-
trend, you must first draw a conventional down trendline along two mar-
ketpeaks.Thenmovetothebottomoftheinterveningtroughanddrawa
line parallel to the declining trendline. You’ll wind up with two declining
trendlines, one above the price action and one (the channel line) below
(seeFigure2.15).Astockwilloftenfindsupportwhenittouchesthelower
channelline.
To draw a rising channel (during an uptrend), you must first draw a
conventional up trendline along two market lows. By moving to the peak
between the two troughs, you can draw another rising trendline exactly
paralleltothelowertrendline—exceptthatthechannellineisrisingabove
the price trend, while the conventional up trendline is below. It’s usually
agoodideatoknowwhererisingchannellinesarelocated,sincemarkets
willoftenstallatthatlevel.
While the channel technique doesn’t always work, it’s usually a good
idea to know where the channel lines are located. A move above a
rising channel line is a sign of market strength, while a decline below a
fallingchannellineisasignofmarketweakness.Somechartservicesrefer
tochannellinesasparallellines.

One-Third to Two-Thirds Retracements
Usually a market will retrace a minimum one-third of its prior move.
A rally from 30 to 60 will often be followed by a 10-point correction
(one-third of the 30-point gain). This minimum retracement tendency is
particularly helpful in the timing of purchases or sales. In an uptrend, an
investor can determine in advance where a one-third retracement lies,
and use that level as a potential buy point. In a downtrend, a one-third
bouncecouldrepresentasellingarea.Sometimesaseverecorrectionwill
retraceasmuchastwo-thirdsofthepriormove.Thatlevelbecomesvery
significant. If the correction is just that, prices rarely retrace more than
two-thirds.Thatarearepresentsanotherusefulsupportareaonthecharts.
Ifamarketmovesbeyondthetwo-thirdspoint,thenatotaltrendreversal
ismostlikelytakingplace.
Mostchartservicesallowtheusertoidentifyretracementlevelsona

and end of a move with a cursor, a table appears which tells the user at
whatpricelevelsthevariouspercentageretracementswilloccur.Asecond
optiondrawshorizontallinesthathighlightthelevelsonthepricechartat
whichthevariouspercentageretracementswilloccur.Theseretracement
lines help function as support levels in an uptrend and resistance levels
in a downtrend. The user can preset the percentage retracements to any
levelsdesired.Thelevelsmostcommonlyusedare38percent,50percent,
and62percent.
Why 38 Percent and 62 Percent?
These two retracement levels are derived from a number series known
as the Fibonacci numbers. This series begins with the number 1 and
adds each two succeeding numbers together (e.g., 1 + 1 = 2, 1 +
2 = 3, and so on). The most commonly used Fibonacci numbers are
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89. Fibonacci ratios are very impor-
tant. The two most important are 38 percent and 62 percent. Each
Fibonacci number is approximately 62 percent of the next higher num-
ber (e.g., 5 =.625); hence, the 62 percent retracement level. 38 is the
8
inverse of 62 (100 − 62 = 38); hence, the 38 percent retracement num-
ber. This is probably all you need to know at this point about these num-
bers. They are very popular among professional traders and are widely
used to determine how far corrections will retrace. Figure 2.16 shows
the 38 percent, 50 percent, and 62 percent retracement lines applied to
achart.

in the same way as a daily chart. One of the real advantages of com-

50 THEVISUALINVESTOR
Logarithmicorsemilogchartsmeasurepricechangesbypercentages
instead of by units. In other words, a move from 10 to 20 looks much
larger than a move from 50 to 60. The reason is that, in percent terms, a
rally from 50 to 60 is not nearly as significant as a move from 10 to 20.
An investor who buys a stock at 10 and watches it rise to 20 has doubled
his or her money—a 100 percent gain. An investor purchasing a stock at
50 and watching it rise to 60 has only gained 20 percent, despite the fact
thatbothstocksrallied10points.Inordertomatchthesame100percent
gainfrom10to20,theotherstockwouldalsohavetoalsodoubleinprice,
risingfrom50to100.Logcharts,therefore,areconstructedinsuchaway
that the gain from 10 to 20 (100 percent) measures the same distance as
themovefrom50to100(100percent).
Generally speaking, the difference between the two scales isn’t that
significantforshortertimeperiods.Mosttradersstillemploythemorefa-
miliar arithmetic scale for that purpose, and there’s no reason why you
shouldn’t do the same. The differences on longer range charts can, how-
ever, be significant. On a semilog chart, successive price increases look
smaller in comparison to earlier moves. As a result, trendlines drawn on
logchartswillbebrokenmuchquicker.There’snoabsoluteanswerasto
which technique is better. For most of our work in this text, we employ
thesimplerarithmeticscaling.However,it’susuallyagoodideatolookat
thechartbothwayswhendoinglonger-rangework.Thecomputerletsyou
switchbackandforthquiteeasily.
VOLUME ANALYSIS
Most price charts also show volume bars along the bottom of the chart.
On a bar chart, for example, the vertical volume bars along the bottom
horizontalpartofthechartcorrespondtoeachpricebarintheupperendof
thechart(seeFigure3.7).Heaviervolumeisshownbylargervolumebars
and, of course, lighter volume can be identified by smaller volume bars.

52 THEVISUALINVESTOR
Granville’s On-Balance Volume
This useful indicator was first described by Joseph Granville in his 1963
book, Granville’s New Key to Stock Market Profits. What makes on-
balance volume (OBV) so useful is that it presents a more visually help-
ful way to view the volume flow and to compare it with the price action
(seeFigure3.8).Volumeshouldincreaseinthedirectionofthepricetrend.
Granville’s indicator makes it easier to make sure that is happening. The
construction of on-balance volume is extremely simple. Every day that a
stock trades, it closes up or down on a certain amount of trading activ-
ity. If the stock closes higher, that day’s volume is given a positive value
and is added to the previous day’s volume. If the stock drops, its volume
isconsideredtobenegativeandissubtractedfromthepreviousday’svol-
ume.Ondayswhenthestockisunchanged,thevolumelinealsoremains
unchanged. In other words, on-balance volume is a running cumulative
totalofpositiveandnegativevolumenumbers.
Eventually, theon-balance volume linewilltakeadirection. Ifthedi-
rectionisup,thelineisbullish,meaningthatthereismorevolumeonup
daysthanondowndays.AfallingOBVlinesignalsthatvolumeisheavier
ondowndays,andisconsideredtobebearish.ByincludingtheOBVline
alongthebottomofthechart(oroverlayedrightontopofthepriceaction),
the analyst can easily see if the price and volume lines are moving in the
samedirection.Ifbotharemovinguptogether,theuptrendisstillhealthy.
In that case, volume is confirming the price trend. However, if prices are
movinghigherwhilethevolumelineisdropping,anegativedivergenceex-
ists,warningthatthepriceuptrendmaybeintrouble.Itiswhentheprice
and volume lines begin to diverge from each other and travel in opposite
directionsthatthemostimportantwarningsignalsaregiven.
ItisthedirectionoftheOBVlinethatmatters,notthenumericalvalue
of the line. The OBV values will change depending on when the line was
begun (how far back you are looking). Concentrate on the trend, not the
numbers.ChartserviceswillcomputeanddrawtheOBVlineforyou.

What the analyst then has is a possible double top in its earliest stages. A
doubletopisnothingmorethanapricechartwithtwoprominentpeaksat

Trading Ranges
ThechartinFigure3.10showswhyweneverknowforsureifthatpullback
isthebeginningofadoubletoporjustanaturalhesitationatapriorresis-
tance level. Prices will often do nothing more than trade sideways for a
whilebetweenthepriorpeakandthepriortroughbeforefinallyresuming
the uptrend. We normally refer to that sideways pattern as a consolida-
tion or a trading range. In order for an actual double top to be present,
something else has to happen. Not only does the stock have to stall at a
previous peak—the price also has to fall enough to close below its previ-
oustrough.Oncethathappens,thepatternofhigherpeaksandtroughshas
beenreversedandtheanalystisleftwithadoubletopreversalpattern.The
double top is also referred to as an M pattern because of its shape (take
anotherlookatFigure3.9).
Although we’ve described a topping pattern, the bottoming pattern
is just a mirror image. A double bottom is present when a market forms
two prominent lows around the same price level, followed by an upside
close through the prior peak. A new uptrend has been started, especially
iftheupsidebreakouttakesplaceonheavyvolume.Hereagain,chartists

If, however, three prominent peaks are visible around the same price
level and prices break below the previous reaction low, then a triple top
reversal pattern has probably occurred (see Figure 3.13). A triple bottom
would naturally show three prominent troughs at about the same price
level, followed by an upward penetration of the previous peals. As you

ifthetradingrangemeasuredfrom50to70,abreaktothedownsidewould
implyatargetto30.
The measurement for the head and shoulders is a bit more precise.
At a top, the vertical distance from the top of the head to the neckline
is subtracted from the level where the neckline is broken on the down-
side. At a head and shoulders bottom, the vertical distance from the bot-
tomoftheheadtothenecklineisaddedtothepointwherepricesexceed
the neckline. Bear in mind, however, that these are not precise measure-
ments and only help to approximate the minimum potential for a market
move.

THE TRIANGLE
This pattern differs from the previous ones in that the triangle is usu-
ally a continuation pattern. Its formation signals that a trend has gotten
ahead of itself and needs to consolidate for a while. Once that consoli-
dation has been completed, the prior trend usually resumes in the same
direction. In an uptrend, therefore, a triangle is usually a bullish pattern.

CHART PATTERN RECOGNITION
SOFTWARE
Virtually all of the technical indicators that are discussed in this book
are relatively objective (as you’ll see in Section Two). A signal is either
given or it isn’t. These indicators also lend themselves to back-testing
to determine their reliability and are very useful in building objective

hefirstthreechapterscoverafairamountofground.Youcouldstop
reading here and still do a fair job of visual market analysis simply
bystudyingthetrendofthemarkets,knowingwherethesupportand
resistance levels are located, drawing some trendlines, and being able to
spot important chart patterns. There are additional indicators, however,
thathelptheanalysttrackexistingtrendsandthatsignalwhenthosetrends
are reversing or losing momentum. This brings us to the moving average,
whichworksespeciallywellinatrendingmarket.
TWO CLASSES OF INDICATORS
Moving averages, like trendlines, help measure the direction of existing
trends and can help determine when a trend change has taken place.
Moving averages also act as support and resistance levels. Moving aver-
ages, as helpful as they are, are lagging indicators. They confirm that
a trend change has occurred, but only after the fact. Another class of

other indicator that uses moving averages, while also functioning as an
oscillator,togiveyouthebestofbothworlds.
THE MOVING AVERAGE
There’s good news and bad news related to the moving average. The bad
news is that it won’t tell you in advance that a trend change is imminent.
The good news is that it will help you determine if an existing trend is
still in motion and help to confirm when a trend change has taken place.
It may be helpful to think of a moving average as a curving trendline. A

same meaning as the breaking of a trendline in the sense that it implies a
trend change. The main advantage of the moving average over the trend-
lineistheformer’sabilitytocombinemorethanonemovingaverageline
togenerateadditionaltradingsignals.
THE SIMPLE AVERAGE
Chart services offer a wide variety of ways to plot moving averages. For
example, the user can plot one moving average line by itself, or combine
two lines to generate crossover signals. The length of the lines can also
bevaried,dependingonwhethertheanalystisplottingshorter-orlonger-
termtrends.Thefirstchoicetobemade,however,iswhichtypeofmoving
averagetoemploy.Let’sexplainwhy.
A moving average is simply an average of a market’s closing prices

WEIGHTING THE AVERAGE
OR SMOOTHING IT?
Whilethesimpleaverageismostcommonlyused,someanalystsprefergiv-
ingextraweighttothemorerecentpriceaction.Thisistheideabehinda
weighted moving average. The weighted average assigns more weight to
recentpricedataandlesserweighttopricesfurtherbackintime.Forthat
reason,theweightedaverageismoresensitivethanthesimpleaverageand
tendstohugthepricetrendmoreclosely.Theexponentiallysmoothedav-
erageisthemostpopularoftheweightedaverages.Thisaverageassignsa
percentagevaluetothelastday’sprice,whichisthenaddedtoapercent-
ageofthepreviousday’svalue.Forexample,thelastday’sclosecouldbe
assignedavalueof.10.Thismeansthatthelastday’sclosingpricewould
begivenavalueof10percent,whichisthenaddedto90percentofthepre-
vious day’s value. A value of .05 would give the last day’s price a smaller
5percentweightingandthepreviousday’salarger95percent.Thehigher
the percentage assigned to the last price, the more sensitive the line be-
comestomorerecentpriceaction.
Computersallowtheusertoconvertthesepercentageweightingsinto
time periods for easier comparison. For example, the 5 percent expo-
nential weighting is equivalent to a 40-day moving average. A 10 percent
weightingwouldbetheequivalentofamoresensitive20-daymovingaver-
age. The person who wants to use a 40-day moving average, for example,
can choose between a simple average, a weighted average, or an expo-
nentially smoothed average by making a keystroke. If you do choose to
experiment with weighted averages, this explanation should help you un-
derstandthedifferences.Anotherreasonforexplainingtheexponentially
smoothed average here is to prepare you for our discussion in Chapter 6

MOVING AVERAGE LENGTHS
What length moving average should one employ? That depends on what
trend the analyst is tracking. For long-term trends, the 200-day average is
mostpopular.The50-dayaverageismostcommonlyusedonstockcharts
totracktheintermediatetrend.Traderswhospecializeinthefuturesmar-
kets, with a much shorter time horizon, like to employ a 40-day average.

MOVING AVERAGE COMBINATIONS
Two moving averages are commonly used to analyze market trends. How
the two averages relate to each other tells a lot about the strength or
weakness of a trend. Two commonly employed numbers among stock in-
vestors are the 50-day (10-week) and the 200-day (40-week) combination.
Thetrendisconsideredbullish(upward)aslongastheshorteraverageis
abovethelonger(seeFigures4.5and4.6).Anycrossingbytheshorteraver-
agebelowthelongerisconsiderednegative.Someanalystsusea10-week
and a 30-week average for the same purpose. In that case, a bullish case
requires that the 10-week average crosses and stays above the 30-week
average.
Whichever combinations are employed, the principle is always the
same. The shorter moving average must be above the longer to justify a
bullishcase.Crossoverbuyandsellsignalsaregivenwhentheshorterav-
eragecrossesaboveorbelowthelongermovingaverageline,respectively.

asavaluablefiltertokeepyoufrombuyingstocksinadowntrend.Moving
averages, however, are not that helpful in an extended trading range or a
periodofsidewayspriceaction.Theyneedatrendtofunctionwell.
Computers also allow you to plot the difference between the two av-
erages.Duringastronguptrend,forexample,theshortermovingaverage

thatisusuallyanearlywarningthattheuptrendislosingsomemomentum.
Put Envelopes around the Average
There are other ways to use the moving average to help monitor sup-
port and resistance levels and to determine market extremes. Trading
envelopes are one example. This technique plots lines, called envelopes,
at predetermined percentage amounts above and below a moving aver-
ageline.Thepercentagesmayvary,dependingonwhichtrendandwhich
market is being studied. Short-term traders, for example, often plot en-
velopes 3 percent above and 3 percent below a 20-day moving average
(see Figure 4.9). Prices will often stall at the upper and lower envelope
lines before correcting back to the moving average line in the middle. A
longer-termversionmightentailplottingenvelopes5percentarounda10-
week average and 10 percent envelopes around a 40-week average (see
Figures 4.10 and 4.11). A price move outside the envelopes warns that a
market has reached a dangerous extreme and is vulnerable to a retrace-
mentintheotherdirection.Someexperimentationisneededtotailorthis
techniquetothemarketyou’refollowingandtotheappropriatetimespan
tosuityourpurposes.
Or Put Bands around It
Bollinger bands, developed by John Bollinger, blend a statistical concept
with the envelope technique. Two bands are placed above and below the
centeredmovingaverage,aswithenvelopes;butinsteadofusingfixedper-
centageamounts(suchas5percentor10percent)aroundthemovingav-
erageline,Bollingerbandsareplottedtwostandarddeviationsaboveand

greeofvolatility.

The interpretation is the same, however. Prices will usually meet re-
sistance at the upper band and support at the lower band. As in the case
of envelopes, threelines are overlaid on theprice chart. On adaily chart,

These bands are also helpful in determining price objectives. During

the20-dayaverageline.
Band Width Is Important, Too
There is another important distinction between trading envelopes and
Bollinger bands: The width of the envelopes stays constant at all times.
For example, in the case of 3 percent envelopes, the two envelopes will
alwaysbe6percentapart(3percentaboveand3percentbelowthemoving
averageline).TheBollingerbands,bycontrast,areconstantlycontracting
and expanding in order to adjust to market volatility. Volatility refers to
thedegreeofmovementinprices.Thebandswillcontractduringperiods

the width of the bands to determine market volatility. Unusually narrow
bands(reflectinglowvolatilityandaquietmarket)areusuallyfollowedby
aperiodofhighvolatility(rapidandsubstantialpricemoves).Conversely,
unusuallywidebands(reflectinghighvolatilityandastrongtrend)usually
warn of a possible slowing in the existing trend (or a return to a trading

well on weekly charts for longer-term perspective. All you have to do is

Not only do oscillators help us determine when a market is overbought
or oversold, but they also warn us in advance when a divergence is
building up in a stock. Divergences usually warn of an impending trend
reversal. We’ve encountered the idea of divergence in our discussion of
on-balance volume in Chapter 3. In other words, we study two lines that

Interpretation of Rate of Change
Themidpointline(zeroline)isthekeytothistypeofoscillator.Acrossing
above the midline is considered to be positive (a buy signal). A crossing
belowthemidlineisnegative(asellsignal).Manyanalystsusetheseoscil-
lators just to generate that type of buy and sell signal. However, they can
also be used to spot market extremes. When the oscillator line has trav-
eledtoofaraboveortoofarbelowthemidline,themarketisconsideredto
be overbought (above) or oversold (below). If the oscillator line starts to
movebacktowardthemidline,itisanearlysignalthatthecurrenttrendis

Thisoscillatordoeshaveonedrawback.
Market Extremes Are Too Subjective
By studying the historical pattern of momentum oscillators, it is possible
to estimate what values marked overbought or oversold extremes in the
past. However, there are no preset values that can be used universally.
For that reason, many analysts prefer other types of oscillators that pre-
servethebenefitsofthemomentumandrateofchangelinesbutsolvethe
problem just mentioned. One of the most popular is the relative strength
index(RSI).

1978book,New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.Themainvalue

Momentum or Rate of Change Oscillators
There arevarious ways toconstruct these twooscillators, but theirinter-
pretation isbasically thesame. The traderiscomparing thelatest closing
price to a price in the past. Depending on which variation is chosen, the
computer will take either the difference between the latest price and the
price in the past or a ratio of the two. Let’s use a 10-day period as an ex-
ample.Inthefirstcase,thecomputersubtractstheprice10daysagofrom
thelatestprice.Ifthelatestpriceishigherthantheoldprice,theoscillator
value will be positive. If the latest price is lower, the oscillator value will
benegative.Usingthatconstruction,theoscillatorwillfluctuateaboveand
belowamidpointlinewhichiscalledazeroline.
Using the ratio method, the computer divides the latest price by the
price 10 days ago. It matters little which formula is used, because both
charts look exactly alike and are interpreted in the same way. Chart pro-
grams sometimes differ in the way these two oscillators are named and
constructed, even though the basic principles are always the same. To

RSI Divergences
The fact that a market has reached an overbought or oversold extreme
in any oscillator does not necessarily mean that a trend reversal is immi-
nent. It just alerts you to the fact that prices have entered a potentially
dangerous area. During a strong uptrend, for example, prices may signal
anoverboughtreadingbymovingabove70ontheRSIlineandstayabove
70 for some time. Sale of a rising stock at that point could prove to be
premature.Thisbringsustothesecondnecessaryingredientinoscillator

to ignore the oscillator for the time being, as long as it stays above 70. A

Crossings of the 50 Line Are Important, Too
Although most of the attention in the RSI oscillator is focused on the 70
and 30 lines, the 50 line is also important. Since it is the midpoint value
on the RSI line (which ranges from 0 to 100), the 50 line often serves the
samefunctionasthezerolineintherateofchangeoscillator.Inthatcase,
buyandsellsignalsareoftengivenbycrossingsaboveandbelowthemid-
point line. You’ll notice, for example, that during a correction in an up-
trend,theRSIlinewilloftenfindsupportatthe50linebeforeturningback
up again. During a downtrend, bounces in the RSI line will halt near the
50line.Crossingsofthe50line,therefore,docarrysomesignificanceand
shouldbemonitored.That’sespeciallytrueonweeklyandmonthlycharts.
Use Weekly and Monthly Charts
We’ve been talking mainly about daily charts. It’s important, however, to
monitor the RSI line on weekly charts as well. Daily charts tend to be
the most volatile and are geared for short-term timing purposes. Weekly
chartscarrymuchmoresignificanceandshouldalwaysbeusedasafilter
on the daily charts. The most potent buy signals, for example, are given
whenboththedailyandweeklylinesareturningupfrombelow30.Ifthe
dailyRSIlineturnsupwhiletheweeklyRSIlineisdropping,thebuysignal
ismuchweakerandisprobablynotverytrustworthy.It’spreferabletouse
the weekly chart for major trend analysis and the daily chart for timing
purposes.
Monthlychartsarealsovaluable,butonlyforverylong-termanalysis.
Once you have asked the computer to show you a 14-day RSI oscillator
on a stock chart, for example, a simple keystroke switches you to a 14-
weekoscillator.Anotherkeystrokeswitchesyoutoa14-monthoscillator.
Short-term traders, utilizing intraday data, can shorten the time span to
a14-minuteor14-hourRSIforday-tradingpurposes. Althoughoscillators
are generally placed along the bottom of the chart for comparison with
the prices located in the upper half of the chart, most charting programs
allowyoutooverlaytheRSIlinerightontopofthepriceactionforeasier

THE STOCHASTICS OSCILLATOR

onemoretime.Theresultisthreelines.Faststochasticsusesthetwofaster

ommended that you utilize slow stochastics. The default values for slow
stochastics are 14, 3, and 3. You’ll find the slower stochastic lines much
smootherandmorereliable.
Stochastic Line Crossings
TheinterpretationofstochasticsissimilartothatoftheRSIline.Lookfor
overbought and oversold situations (in this case, however, the values are
80and20).Thenlookforpotentialdivergences,aswiththeRSI.Whatdis-
tinguishesstochasticsisthecrossing ofthetwolines,whichaddsavalu-
ableingredient tothisoscillator.Givenanoversoldcondition (below20),
especially whereapositive divergence exists, acrossing by thefaster %K
line above the slower %D line constitutes a buy signal. In an overbought
condition(above80),anycrossingbythefaster%K linebelowtheslower
%Dlineconstitutes asellsignal. Therefore, thestochastics oscillator pro-
vides not only a warning of a dangerously extended market, but provides
anactionsignalaswell.
What about Running Markets?
As discussed previously, a strong uptrend will often provide stochastic
readingsthatriseabove80andstaythere.Inthosecases,it’susuallybest
towaitforthestochasticlinestodropbelow80togiveasellsignal.There
are going to be periods during strong trending markets when this oscilla-
torisnotveryhelpful.Thatiswhysomejudgmentisalwaysinvolved,and
whyit’simportanttousethisandalloscillatorsinconjunctionwithother
indicators. It’s foolish to slavishly follow all buy and sell crossings in this
indicator without consideration of the overall trend of the market. Which
bringsustoourfinalpoint—theuseoflonger-rangesignals.
Weekly Signals Determine Position
Perhapsthegreatestweaknessintheoscillatorapproachistheabsenceof

tooversoldandbacktooverboughtagain.Successivebuyandsellsignals
are given. It’s silly to attempt to follow each signal. For example, during
an uptrend, buy signals are much more important than sell signals. Dur-
ing a downtrend, sell signals are much more important than buy signals.
The overall trend of the market must always be taken into consideration.
Why would you want to sell a stock that is in an uptrend or buy a stock
in a downtrend? One way to get around this problem is to employ other

trend-following techniques, such as the moving average, to determine the
directionofthemarket.Anotheristoemployaweeklystochasticschartas
atrendfilteronthedailystochasticchart.
Use the weekly stochastic indicator to determine the trend of the
market and which side of that market you will be trading from. As long
as the weekly stochastic lines are positive (the faster %K line above the
slower %D), operate only from the buy side. Utilize oversold readings on
thedailychartforbuyingopportunities whileignoringtheshort-termsell
signals.Whentheweeklystochasticslinesarenegative(fasterlinebelow
the slower), ignore buy signals on the daily chart and utilize short-term
overbought readings for selling purposes. What you’re doing then is buy-
ingdipsinuptrendsandsellingralliesindowntrends.(Figures5.9and5.10
showwhyit’sbettertocombineweeklyanddailysignals.)
Time Filter Signals
Monthlystochasticschartsarealsorecommendedforlonger-rangeanaly-
sisandconfirmation.Attheotherextreme,short-termtradersoftenutilize
14-hour charts and 14-minute stochastic charts for day-trading purposes.
Whatever time period you are trading (14 hours, 14 days, or 14 weeks),
always use the next longer time period to determine the direction of the
marketyouwillbetradingfrom.Ifyouaretrading14-hourstochastics,use
14 days to determine the trend. If you are trading 14-day stochastics, use
14weeksasatrendfilter.Whynotusethe14-monthstochasticsasafilter
onthe14-weekchartaswell?(seeFigure5.11).
It’s also a good idea to use the same time span on all of your charts.
For example, if you use 14 on your dailies, use 14 on your weeklies and
monthliesaswell.
COMBINE RSI AND STOCHASTICS
It’s always best to combine indicators. Each of these oscillators can be
usedbyitself,buttheirvalueisenhancedwhentheyareusedtogether.For
one thing, the stochastics oscillator (being more volatile) tends to reach
overboughtandoversoldareasmuchfasterthantheRSIline.Stochastics
also tends to provide many more divergences than the RSI line. As a re-
sult, the stochastics signals are earlier, but often less reliable than those
given by the relative strength index. I like to keep both oscillators on the
bottom of the chart. When the stochastics lines are giving overbought or
oversoldreadings,IgenerallyliketowaitfortheslowerRSIlinetoconfirm

How to Have

T
he most criticalproblem facing the visual investor isknowing when
to emphasize each class of indicator. During a strong trending pe-
riod,movingaverageswilloutperformmostotherindicators.During
choppymarketperiods,whenpricesswingbackandforthinanessentially
trendless manner, oscillators are much better than moving averages. For-
tunately,thereisoneindicatorthatcombinesthebestofbothworldsinthe

ingofthemovingaverageconvergencedivergence(MACD)indicator.
MACD CONSTRUCTION
Thisindicator,developedbyGeraldAppel,utilizesthreemovingaverages
initsconstructionalthoughonlytwolinesareshownonthechart.Thefirst
line (called the MACD line) is the difference between two exponentially
smoothed moving averages of the price (usually 12 and 26 periods). The
computersubtractsthelongeraverage(26)fromtheshorter(12)toobtain
the MACD line. A moving average (usually nine periods) is then used to
smooth the MACD line to form a second (signal) line. The result is that
two lines are shown on the chart, the faster MACD line and the slower
signal line (see Figure 6.1). Some analysts prefer to use the preceding

moving average values for buy signals and another set of values for sell
signals,asAppeloriginallyrecommended.Theproblemwithdoingthatis
thatyouneedtoconstructtwodifferentMACDindicatorswithtwodiffer-
entsetsofnumbers.Perhapsforthisreason,orforpurposesofsimplicity,
most analysts seem content to employ the previously mentioned default
values(9,12,and26)inallsituations.Bydoingitthatway,thesamemov-
ing average values can be used for buy and sell signals on all markets, as
wellasondaily,weekly,andmonthlycharts.
MACD AS TREND-FOLLOWING
INDICATOR
InterpretationofthetwolinesintheMACDsystemisrelativelystraightfor-
wardandissimilartothecrossover techniquedescribedinthediscussion
ofmovingaveragesinChapter4.Inotherwords,buysignalsareregistered
when the faster MACD line crosses above the slower signal line. Sell sig-
nals occur when the faster line crosses below the slower. By using it in
that fashion, valuable trading signals are given that will keep you on the
rightsideofatrend(i.e.,onthelongsideduringuptrends,andontheshort
side or out of the market during downtrends). Naturally, signals given on
dailychartsaremorefrequentandofshorterdurationthanthosegivenon
weeklycharts.That iswhyitisbesttoplacemorerelianceontheMACD
crossoversignalsgivenonweeklycharts,andtoutilizethedailychartsfor
timingpurposesorforshorter-termtradingsignals(seeFigure6.2).
MACD AS AN OSCILLATOR
Beingabletousethissameindicatortodetermineoverboughtandoversold
conditions gives it a particularly unique quality. This is possible because
theMACDandsignallinesfluctuateaboveandbelowazeroline,justlike
the rate of change oscillator described in Chapter 5. The best buy signals
are given when the two lines are below the zero line (oversold) and the
best sell signals when the two lines are above the zero line (overbought).
Someanalystsusecrossingsaboveandbelowthezerolineasanadditional
waytofindbuyandsellsignals.AbullishcrossingoftheMACDlinesthat
takes place below the zero line, for example, would be confirmed when
bothlinescrossabovethezerolinethemselves.
Studying the MACD system, you will observe that when the lines rise
too far above the zero line, a potential overbought signal is given. Con-
versely, when the lines drop too far below the zero line, a possible over-
sold condition is signaled. Unfortunately, the MACD lines have no prede-
terminedoverboughtandoversoldlevelsasexistwiththerelativestrength

much the same as an oscillator to determine when markets have risen or

HOW TO BLEND DAILY AND
WEEKLY SIGNALS
Signals givenonweeklychartsalwayscarrymoretrendsignificance than
those given on daily charts. It also follows that signals on weekly charts
are less important than those on monthly charts, while signals on daily
charts carry more significance than those on hourly charts. The universal
guiding price in all market analysis is that a longer-range chart is always
more significant than a shorter-time chart. Our primary concern here is
howtoblendweeklyanddailysignals.Let’ssaythatyourcomputerflashes

HOW TO MAKE MACD EVEN
BETTER—THE HISTOGRAM
AsgoodastheMACDindicatorisintheformjustdescribed,there’saway
tomakeitevenbetter.ThattechniqueiscalledtheMACDhistogram.The
MACDhistogramprovidesevenearlierwarningsofpotentialtrendchanges
andgreatlyenhancesthevalueoftheindicator.Sincethehistogramshows
theMACDcrossoversignals(inaslightlydifferentway),nothingislostin
its use. What is gained is a way to generate action signals much sooner.
ThehistogramsimplyplotsthedifferencebetweentheMACDlineandthe
signalline.It’scalledahistogrambecauseverticalbarsareusedtoshow
thedifferencebetweenthetwolines(seeFigure6.5).
The MACD histogram fluctuates above and below a zero line of its
own. When the histogram value is above the zero line, it simply means
thatthetwoMACDlinesareinbullishalignment(MACDoversignalline).
As long as the histogram value is above its zero line, the MACD signals
arestillbullish.WhenthefasterMACDlinecrossesbelowtheslowersig-
nal line (registering a sell signal), the histogram value falls below its zero
lineaswell.Crossingsaboveandbelowthezerolinebythehistogramal-
ways coincide with bullish and bearish crossings by the two MACD lines
themselves.Asstatedearlier,thisisjustanotherwayofviewingthesame
system.Here’swheretheadvantageofthehistogramcomesin.
Ifthehistogram isabove itszeroline(bullish),butbeginstodropto-
wardthezeroline,thattellsusthatthepositiverelationship(orspread)be-
tweenthetwoMACDlines,althoughstillpositive,isbeginningtoweaken.
Remember that the histogram measures the difference between the two
MACDlines.Theplusorminusvalueofthehistogram(aboveorbelowits
zeroline)tellsusiftheMACDlinesarebullishorbearish.Thedirectionof
thehistogramtellsuswhetherthatbullishorbearishrelationshipisgaining
orlosingmomentum.
Let’stakeamarketinadowntrend.Thehistogramisbelowzero,which
meansthattheMACDlineisbelowitssignalline.Inotherwords,thestock
is in a downtrend. For a while, the histogram is also dropping. Suddenly,
the histogram lines start to rise toward the zero line. This tells us that al-
though the MACD system is still negative (no buy signal yet), the down-
trendislosingmomentum.Manytraderswillcovershortpositionsinthis
instance.Anactualbuysignaltoinitiatealongpositiondoesn’ttakeplace
untilthehistogrammovesaboveitszeroline.Thepatternisjusttheoppo-
siteinanuptrend.

averages are your friend during a trend, but can be cruel to your bottom
lineduringatradingrangeenvironment.
Oscillators work especially well in choppy market environments and
at important turning points when a trend is losing momentum. Dur-
ing a strong trend in the stock market oscillators can be more harmful
than helpful. Fortunately, there is an indicator that can help resolve this
dilemma.
THE AVERAGE DIRECTIONAL
MOVEMENT (ADX) LINE
This line is part of a more complex trading system, also developed by
Welles Wilder, called directional movement. We’re only introducing this
tradingsystemheretoalertyoutohowitmighthelpsolvethepreviously
mentioned problem. Appendix A explains where you can find a more in-
depthexplanationoftheentiresystem.Theideabehinddirectionalmove-
ment is to determine whether a market is in a trending or nontrending
mode.
First, two lines that measure buying and selling pressure are gener-
ated. They are called +DI (positive directional indicator) and −DI (neg-
ative directional indicator). A bullish environment exists when the +DI
line is greater than the −DI line. From these two lines, a third line is
generatedcalledtheaverage directional movement(ADX)line.TheADX
line is basically derived from the difference between the +DI and −DI
lines.
ArisingADXlinetellsusthatamarketisinatrendingmode.Afalling
or flat ADX line reflects a trading range environment. An ADX line fluctu-
ates from below 20 to above 40. An ADX line which has fallen below 20
implies low volatility and the absence of any trend (favoring a nontrend-
ingapproach).AnADXlinethatsuddenlyrisesabove20oftensignalsthe
beginning of an important trend (and the application of trend-following
techniques). An ADX that has risen too far above 40 and starts to drop
usuallysignalsthatthetrendhasexhausted itselfandthatitmaybetime
to switch from a trend-following system back to one which emphasizes a
morevolatilemarketenvironment.
Try using the average directional movement line as an overall filter
to help determine which type of indicator is most suitable in the current
market environment. A rising ADX line favors moving averages; a falling
ADXlinefavorsoscillators.TheADXlinecanbeusedondailyandweekly
charts,althoughweeklysignalsaremoresignificant(seeFigure6.8).

SUMMARY
The moving average convergence divergence—MACD—indicator com-
bines the best features of a moving average crossover system with the
ability to determine overbought and oversold conditions such as an os-
cillator. Employing a histogram greatly enhances the value of the MACD
linesbyenablingthetradertoanticipatesignalsevenbeforetheyhappen.
Although these signals can be used on daily and weekly charts, the latter
are considered to be more important. As in the case of other computer-
ized indicators, it is suggested that you begin with the default values of
12,26,and9.Asyougainmoreexperiencewiththisandotherindicators,

he visual—or charting—approach to investing has traditionally em-
phasized a single-market approach. A stock trader, for example,
would study the price charts of the stock market or individual com-
mon stocks with little consideration of outside market influences. It was
considered sufficient to study the price charts of the market in question
along with its own set of internal indicators. The same attitude was true
of traders in other asset classes. Bond traders studied bond charts, while
commoditytraderschartedthecommoditymarkets.Currencytraderslim-
itedtheirchartworktothecurrenciestheyweretrading.Thatisnolonger
the case. Chart analysis has taken a major evolutionary step over the
lastdecadebyemphasizingamoreuniversalintermarketapproach.Ilike
to think that my book, Intermarket Technical Analysis (John Wiley &
Sons, 1991) and its subsequent edition Intermarket Analysis: Profiting
FromGlobalMarketRelationships(JohnWiley&Sons,2004)helpedmove
thingsinthatdirection.
Some understanding of how the different asset classes interact with
eachotherisimportantforatleasttworeasons.First,suchanunderstand-

youshouldbemonitoringthedirectionofstocks.Veryoften,chartaction

bond prices is often associated with a drop in stock prices. In another il-

chapter,thedirectionofthedollaralsohelpsdeterminetherelativeattrac-
tivenessofforeignstockscomparedtothoseintheUnitedStates.
A second reason why it’s important to undertand intermarket rela-
tionships is to help with the asset allocation process. There was a time
when investors’ choices were limited to bonds, stocks, or cash. Asset
allocation models were based on that limited philosophy. Over the last
decade,however,investmentchoiceshavebroadenedconsiderably.Since
2002, commodities have become the strongest asset class of all and are
now being recognized by Wall Street and the investing public as a viable
alternative to bonds and stocks. This is especially true when bond and
stock gains appear limited. The growing availability of exchange-traded
funds(ETFs)hasmadeinvestingincommoditymarketsaseasyasbuying
a stock on a stock exchange. The same is true for currency markets.
Up until recently, currency trading was limited to professional interbank
tradersandfuturesspecialists.Thisisnolongerthecase.Anewfamilyof
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds has put currency trading within
easy reach of the average investor. Why is that to your benefit? From the
startof2002tothestartof2008,theU.S.dollarfell35percenttoarecord
low. At the same time, the euro and Canadian dollar gained 70 percent
and 61 percent respectively. During those same six years, commodity
marketsrose110percent.Bycomparison,U.S.stocksrose15percentand
Treasury bonds 12 percent. Which of those four asset classes would you
havepreferredtobein?
THE ASSET ALLOCATION PROCESS
My main purpose here is to show you how the major financial markets
interact with each other and how you can use that information in the as-
setallocationprocess.Let’sstartwithoneofthebest-knownintermarket
principles:theinverserelationshipbetweentheU.S.dollarandcommodity

from 2000 through 2002 and stocks between 2003 and 2007. In mid-2007,
however, the ratio swung back in favor of bonds. During that summer,
subprime mortgage problems first surfaced in the mortgage and banking
sectors (together with a sharp slowdown in the housing industry) which

BONDS RISE AS STOCKS FALL
I mentioned earlier in the chapter that one market usually rises when an-
other falls. Figure 7.6 shows that negative interaction occurring between
bondandstockpricesduring2007.Figure7.6overlaysthepriceoftheS&P
500(dailypricebars)onthepriceofthe10-yearTreasuryNote(solidline).
During the first half of 2007, stock prices rose as bond prices fell. During
July, however, the stock market fell as subprime fears started to surface.
Bond prices turned up immediately. A second stock drop during October
gave the bond uptrend another boost. When one market (like stocks)
drops, another one (likebonds) rises. The trickis tomove out of theone
turningdownandintotheonemovingup.Butyouhavetobeabletospot
the turn first. You can do that by using the visual tools available to you,
along with some understanding of the intermarket principles that make
thatrotationhappen.

COMMODITY-RELATED STOCKS
Although I’m going to deal with the matter of choosing the right market
sectors and industry groups in a later chapter, this is a good spot to in-
troduce the idea that many stocks are tied to the fortunes of commodity
markets.Thatoffersanotherwaytoparticipateinanuptrendincommodity
markets.Entering2008,thefive-yearperformancerecordforstocksector
mutual funds showed gold-oriented funds in first place with a cumulative
gain of 30.5 percent. A close second was natural resource funds (which
are mainly energy stocks) with a gain of 30.3 percent. Those gains were
threetimeslargerthananyothersectorfunds.Whencommoditiesarethe

Figure7.9comparesthepriceofcrudeoil(bars)toarelativestrength
ratiooftheEnergySectorSPDR(XLE)dividedbytheS&P500since2002.
Notice the tight correlation between the two lines. In mid-2004, crude oil
rose above $40 (left scale) to hit a record high. Within four years, it had
reached $140 a barrel. During those four years of rising energy prices,
Energy stocks as a group gained 181 percent. That made them the mar-
ket’sstrongestsectorbyawidemargin.Togiveyouanideaofhowmuch

FOREIGN STOCKS ARE LINKED
TO THE DOLLAR
Let’s widen the net even further to include foreign stocks. Another rea-
son to keep an eye on the trend of the U.S. dollar is because its direction
helpsdeterminewhenforeignstocksaremoreorlessattractivethanU.S.
stocks. Figure 7.10 helps make that point. The falling bars show the ma-
jor descent in the U.S. dollar starting in 2002. The rising solid line is a
ratio of the Morgan Stanley World Stock Index (ex-USA) divided by the
S&P500.Theratioshowshowforeigndevelopedstockmarketshavedone
“relative” to the U.S. stock market. It also shows that foreign stocks did
muchbetterthanU.S.stockssince2002whenthedollarstarteddropping.

At their respective peaks in fourth quarter 2007, foreign stocks doubled
theperformanceoftheS&P500(+160percentversus+80percent)from
their 2003 bottom. That shows that U.S. investors need to take currency
trends into consideration when planning global investments. One of the
reasonsforthestrongerperformanceofforeignstocksfrom2003to2007
is that foreign stocks are quoted in their local currencies. When they’re
quoted in terms of a weaker U.S. currency, foreign gains are even big-
ger for U.S. investors. Conversely, weaker foreign currencies (a stronger
dollar)hurt U.S. foreign investments. The general ruleofthumb isthis: A
fallingdollarfavorsforeigninvestments,whileastrongerdollarfavorsU.S.
investments.
COMMODITY EXPORTERS GET
BIGGER BOOST
Not all foreign markets rise equally. Not only does a falling dollar fa-
vor foreign stocks, but it also favors those countries’ stocks that are
commodityexporters.That’sbecausetheygetadoubleboostfromafalling

the five years from 2003 through 2007 as commodity prices were rising,
the top overseas stock fund was Latin America (+51 percent). Emerging
markets(ofwhichLatinAmericaisabigpart)cameinsecondat+34per-

icawasthefactthatitwasabigexporterofcommoditiesatatimewhen

the rising fortunes of oil, metals, and steel. (Most of the foreign demand

thanothersatvarioustimes,butglobalstocksgenerallytrendinthesame
majordirection.WhentheU.S.stockmarketstartedtoweakenduringthe
second half of 2007, a new theory circulated through Wall Street and the
financial media that foreign stocks were relatively immune from a U.S.
stockmarketdropandpossibleU.S.recession.Thattheorywaspredicated
on the mistaken belief that U.S. housing and related subprime mortgage
problems were U.S. and not a foreign problem. That theory violated one
ofthekeyprinciplesofintermarketanalysiswhichisbasedontightglobal
linkages. And it didn’t take long for it to be proven wrong. Between the
fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, many of the world’s
stock markets fell even further than the U.S. market. Little more was
heard about global decoupling. That simultaneous drop in global stocks,
however, raises some caveats on foreign investing. Foreign markets can
provideexcellentdiversificationinaglobal“bull”market,especiallywhen
the U.S. currency is weak. During a global “bear” market, however,
most stock markets will eventually start to decline. At such times, the
benefits of global diversification are greatly diminished. That’s especially
trueiftheU.S.dollarstartstostrengthen,whichdiminishestheappealof

RISING YEN THREATENS
GLOBAL STOCKS
Duringspring2007,Iworkedonavideoproducttoeducateinvestorsabout
the benefits of intermarket analysis. To dramatically show how action in
one asset class could effect another, I explained how the Japanese yen
could be used as a contrary indicator for global stocks. Here’s why. For
several years, Japanese interest rates had been the lowest in the world
(near zero). As a result, the Japanese yen was the weakest of the world’s
major currencies. That precipitated the so-called “yen carry trade,” when
global investors borrowed yen (sold it short) at very low interest rates
andusedthatcheapmoneytobuyhigher-yieldingassetselsewhereinthe
world.Asaresult,aninverserelationshipdevelopedbetweenaweakyen

that any sudden rise in the yen could threaten the bull market in global
stocks.Arisingyenwouldforceglobaltraderstobuytheyenback(cover
theirshortpositions)andsellglobalassetselsewhere.Andthat’sjustwhat
happenedlaterin2007.
Figure 7.12 compares the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar relationship (can-
dlesticks) to the Dow Jones World Stock Index (solid line) during 2007.
During the first half of that year, the yen fell as stocks rose (as had been
the case for several years). During July, however, the yen started to rally
sharply.Bycomparingthetwoarrows,youcanseethattheyenupturnco-
incidedexactlywiththestartofatoppingprocessinglobalstocks.Byfirst
quarter 2008, the yen had risen to the highest level in three years against

REVIEW OF 2004 INTERMARKET BOOK
Forthoseofyouseekingamorecomprehensiveexplanationofintermarket

Thatearlierworkexaminesindetailtheintermarketeventsleadingupto
andfollowingthestockmarkettopthatstartedin2000,aswellastheup-
turn that began during spring 2003. The book you’re reading now deals
with market trends since then, including intermarket events surrounding
the stock market top of 2007. Another reason that I recommend consult-
ing the earlier intermarket book is because many of the trends discussed
inthisbook(likethemajordeclineinthedollarandtheensuingbullmar-
ketincommodities) wereactuallydescribed whenthatbookwaswritten
during2003.Ipointthatoutsimplytodemonstratethatthesetrendsarenot

“ShiftingFromPapertoHardAssets,”issimilartooneoftheheadlinesin

2008wererepeatsofwhathappenedeightyearsearlier.Inbothtimeperi-
ods,bondpricesroseasstocksfell.During2008,asin2001,theFedstarted

Thischapterisintendedtoexplainhowthevariousfinancialmarketsinter-
act with each other. Those markets include bonds, stocks, commodities,
and currencies. (We discuss housing and real estate in a future chapter.)
Foreign markets are also part of the mix. Rather than focus on the eco-
nomic reasons between those linkages, I’ve tried to show how the use of
asimpletechnicaltoolliketherelativestrengthratiocanbeindispensable

he previous chapter showed that commodities were the strongest
asset class going into 2007 and had been so for several years. That
reality favored investments in commodities and stocks tied to those
commodities(likeenergyandgoldshares),whichremainedstockmarket
leadersthroughout2007.Inthischapter,we’regoingtostudytheotherside
oftheequationbylookingatstockmarketgroupsthatstartedtounderper-
formtheU.S.stockmarketduringthesecondhalfofthatyear.Atthesame
time, we’re going to study the negative impact those weak groups had on
marketbreadth,whichgaveearlywarningsignsthatthestockmarketwas
peaking as 2007 drew to a close. We start by examining obvious warning
signs in the most popular indicator of stock market breadth, which is the
NYSE advance-decline line. Near the end of the chapter, you learn about
other useful breadth indicators that show that the last market move into

MEASURING MARKET BREADTH
WITH NYSE AD LINE
MarketbreadthusuallyreferstothenumberofNYSEstocksthatarerising
versus those that are falling on any given day. If there are more advanc-
ing stocks than decliners, market breadth for that day is positive. More
declines than advances translate into a negative breadth day. There are
several ways to measure market breadth. The most popular is the NYSE
advance-decline line. The AD line is simply a running cumulative total of

are more advances than declines and the market is in an uptrend. Mar-

would have negative implications for the economy and the stock market.
Let’sconsiderwhythathappened.
RETAILERS AND HOMEBUILDERS
WERE LINKED
Throughout 2007, one of the mantras repeated over and over again in
the financial media was that the U.S. economy was still pretty healthy.
Economists claimed that the fallout from a weakening housing sector
wasn’t having much of a negative impact on retail spending or the rest of
theeconomy.Asaresult,therewasn’tmuchconcernaboutthedownturn
in housing infecting the economy or the stock market. Unfortunately, vi-
sualanalysistoldaverydifferentstory.Figure8.5showsweeklypricebars
for the PHLX Housing Index. The chart shows that homebuilding stocks
actually peaked in the middle of 2005, but really started dropping dur-
ing the first half of 2006. They fell even more sharply during the second
half of 2007. One of the reasons for looking at market charts is that fi-
nancial markets have a way of “discounting” economic fundamentals be-
fore those fundamentals become generally known. The peak in housing
stocks during 2005 and their downturn in early 2006 (which was so clear
onthecharts)gavetwowarnings.Onewarningwasthatitwastimetoexit
homebuilding stocks that had been market leaders since 2000. A second
warningwasthataweakerhousingsectorcouldhavenegativeimplications
fortherestoftheeconomy.Thatwarning,bytheway,wasgivenanywhere
fromonetotwoyearsbeforesubprimeproblemssurfacedinsummer2007,
andwaslargelyignoredbythefinancialcommunity.
Figure 8.5 shows that another piece of conventional wisdom was
wrong which was that the housing downturn wasn’t spreading to other
partsoftheeconomy.ThesolidlineinFigure8.5isthesameRetail/S&P500

CONSUMERS ARE ALSO SQUEEZED
BY RISING OIL
During2007,consumerswerebeinghitfromtwodifferentdirections.Not
onlywasthepriceoftheirhomesfallingforthefirsttimeintheirlifetime,
but energy prices were soaring to record heights. Figure 8.6 overlays the
Retail/S&P ratio (solid line) on weekly price bars of crude oil. From the
start of 2006 to spring 2008, the two lines show a generally inverse cor-
relation. In other words, they trended in opposite directions. A surge in
oil prices near the start of 2007 was especially negative for retailers for
therestofthatyear(seearrows).Adoublingofcrudeoilfrom$50atthe
startof2007 to$100 attheend oftheyearaccompanied a2007 plunge in
theperformanceofretailstocks(afallingratio).Aswasthecasewiththe
relationship between retailing and housing, the financial community held
to the mistaken belief that rising oil prices weren’t having a negative im-
pactontheconsumer.Visualinvestorsknewbetter.Risingoilpricesdidn’t
justhurttherelativeperformanceofretailstocks.Italsoaccountedforthe
2007dropintransportationstockswhichledtoanotheroneofthenegative
divergencesreferredtoearlier.AndthatbringsustotheDowTheory.
DOW THEORY
The venerable Dow Theory is one of the oldest approaches in market
analysis (having been first defined by Charles Dow at the start of the
twentieth century). It was Charles Dow who invented the first two stock
indexes, which were the Dow Industrials and Transports. At first, the
transports were limited to railroads. In time, however, airlines and truck-
ers were added to the transportation index. Dow reasoned that, in a
healthy economy, industrial and transportation stocks should be rising
together. After all, the industrial companies made the products while the
transportation companies moved them to market. One couldn’t function
without the other. Although he intended his idea to be used mainly as an
indicatorofeconomictrends,itlaterbecameadaptedtothestockmarket
itself.Initssimplestform,DowTheoryholdsthattheDowJonesIndustrial
andTransportationaveragesmustrisetogetherinanongoingbullmarket.
If one of them lags too far behind the other, or forms a serious negative
divergence from the other, a stock market peak may be at hand. One of
thefirstdangersignsoccurswhenoneofthetwohitsanewhighandthe
otherdoesn’t.That’sjustwhathappenedduring2007.Anditprobablyhad

TRANSPORTS DON’T CONFIRM

During the bull market from 2003 to 2007, industrial and transportation
stocksroseprettymuchintandem.Thatchangedinabigwayduring2007.
Figure 8.7 shows the Dow Industrials and Transports rising together into
mid-2007. During July and August of that year, however, transportation
stocks(solidline)fellfurtherthantheindustrials(pricebars).Atfirst,that
didn’tseemtooserious.DuringOctober,however,theDowIndustrialsrose

fallingtrendline).ThatnegativedivergencebetweenthetwoDowaverages

ketuptrendwasintrouble.Therewereprobablytworeasonsforthat.
One of the reasons for the sudden drop in transportation stocks was
risingoilprices.Forreasonsthatshouldseemobvious,transportsarees-
peciallyvulnerabletorisingoil.Airlinesandtruckersusehugeamountsof
fuelintheiroperations.Althoughrailroadscanpassmostoftheirfuelcosts

coststhatoccurredduring2007whenoildoubledinprice.
Another factor hurting transportation stocks was a weakening econ-
omy(resultingfromahousing depression). That’sbecause thetransports
are considered to be economically sensitive stocks. That means they’re
tied to the business cycle. As such, they’re especially vulnerable to early
signs of a slowing economy. If demand for goods starts to drop, there
are fewer goods to transport. And as Charles Dow predicted a century
before, the downturn in transportation stocks during the second half of
2007turnedouttobeabadsignfortheeconomy(andthestockmarket).
Thestockmarketisconsideredtobealeadingindicatoroftheeconomy.
Historically, stocks usually peak six to nine months before the economy.
Since the stock market started peaking in July 2007, the time target for
an economic downturn was during first half 2008. By mid-2008, most
economistsacknowledgedthelikelystartofaU.S.recession.

Some chart services include an indicator that measures the percent
of NYSE stocks that are trading above their 200-day averages. Figure 8.8
compares that indicator to the NYSE Composite Index during 2007. As is
normallydonewithmarketbreadthindicators,theideaistocomparethe
direction of the two lines. In a healthy uptrend, both lines should be ris-
ing together. Figure 8.8 shows, however, that the percent of stocks over
their200-dayaverage(solidline)starteddroppingsharplyinthemiddleof
the year. That negative divergence between the two lines was especially
noticeablewhentheNYSECompositeIndexhitarecordhighduringOcto-
berofthatyearandthebreadthindicatordidn’tevencomeclosetodoing
so (see arrow). While the NYSE was hitting a new high, only two-thirds
of its stocks were still in uptrends. That weakening in the breadth indi-
cator warned the visual investor that the stock market rally wasn’t to be
trusted.Andthatwarningprovedtobeverytimely.Butthere’smoretothis
indicator.
As important as the direction of this breadth indicator is, there are
other factors to consider. The vertical scale along the right side of Fig-
ure8.8givesustheactualpercentageofstockstradingovertheir200-day
average. Readings over 70 percent usually warn of a dangerously overex-
tendedmarket.Byearly2007,theindicatorhadreached85percent.When
that happens, a first warning of a market drop is given when the percent
linefallsbackbelowthe70percentline.DuringthatJuly,theindicatorfell

startingtoweaken.
The40percentlineseparatesbullmarketsfrombearmarkets.Theper-
cent line fell below that level during August 2007 and again during the
fourth quarter. That was the first move below that support line since the
bull market started more than four years earlier. At the time, the drop
in the major market indexes was still relatively small. In one of my mar-
ket reports written during that period, I asked the following question:

MarketBreadth 179
How can a bull market exist in the NYSE Composite Index if nearly two-
thirds of the stocks in that index are in bear markets? After all, the stock
market is a market of stocks. And most of those stocks started falling
well before the major market indexes. During the first quarter of 2008,
the percent line traded as low as 20 percent. Readings below 30 percent
usually warn that the market is due for a rebound. To signal the start
of a new bull market, however, the percent line has to rise back over
60percent.
This is a good spot to point out one of the fallacies of just following
a major market index like the NYSE Composite Index, and why breadth
indicators are so valuable in spotting market tops. Most major market in-
dexesarecapitalizationweighted.Thatmeansthatbiggerstocksaregiven

NYSE BULLISH PERCENT INDEX
This next breadth indicator is also intended to tell us what the majority
of stocks are doing as opposed to the major market indexes—the NYSE
BullishPercentIndex(BPI).Toexplainthisindicator,however,referback
to one of the chart types mentioned briefly in Chapter 3, the point-and-
figurechart.OneofthevaluesoftheP&Fchartisthatitgivesspecificbuy

Figure 8.9 shows the NYSE Bullish Percent Index (solid line) plotted
overtheNYSECompositeIndexpricebarsduring2007.Itlooksverysim-
ilar to the chart in Figure 8.8. And its interpretation is also similar. The
idea again is to compare the direction of the two lines. And, once again,
a major negative divergence is visible during October 2007. The percent-
age scale along the right vertical side of Figure 8.9 is also similar to the
one shown in the preceding figure. Readings over 70 percent warn of an
overboughtmarket,whilereadingsbelow30percentareconsideredtobe

SUMMARY
Thischapterdealswiththesubjectofmarketbreadth.Theseindicatorstell
the visual investor what the majority of stocks are doing and not just the
large-cap stocks that dominate the major market indexes. These market
breadth indicators are especially important at spotting market tops and
bottoms.Theirvaluelinesinthefactthattheygenerallychangedirection
beforethemajormarketindexes.That’sespeciallytrueofmarkettops.The
best known measure of market breadth is the NYSE advance-decline line
which measures the number of advancing stocks on the big board minus
the number of declining stocks. In a healthy uptrend, the AD line should
risealongwiththemajorindexes.During2007,theNYSEADlinestarting

Mostofthosenegativedivergenceswerespottedinmarketgroupsthat

discretionarystocks,financials,smallcapstocks,andthetransports.Visual
comparisons showed that selling in retail stocks was caused by a falling
housing market and rising oil prices. Transportation stocks fell as a re-
sult of the doubling in oil prices during 2007 and gave a Dow Theory sell
signal.DowTheoryholdsthatindustrialandtransportationstocksshould

that year. That meant that only one-third of the big board stocks were in
point-and-figure uptrends. At the same time, the NYSE Composite Index
was down only 10 percent from its October high, which signaled nothing
more than a normal market correction. Obviously, the breadth indicator

RELATIVE STRENGTH VERSUS
ABSOLUTE PERFORMANCE
Asimportantasrelativestrengthis,it’snottheonlyconsideration.There’s
also the question of absolute performance. In a bull market, for example,

ket,however,somegroupsorstocksmayshowrelativestrengthbutabso-

market.Allyou’redoinginthatsituationislosingyourmoneymoreslowly.
In a falling market, it’s certainly better to be in groups that are losing the
leastmoney.However,Iprefertolookforsituationsthatareshowingboth

Make sure the market you’re considering is in an uptrend first. Then con-
sideritsrelativestrength.Relativestrengthinarisingassetisbetterthan
relativestrengthinafallingasset.
Let’sshowanexampleofthedifferencebetweenabsoluteandrelative
performance.TheweeklypricebarsinFigure9.1showtheSemiconductor
(SOX) Index over a five-year period. From the middle of 2003 to the end
of 2007, the SOX Index basically trended sideways. While no money was
made during those three years, none was lost either. Or was it? The solid
line in Figure 9.1 is a relative strength ratio of the SOX Index divided by
the S&P 500. That line fell from the start of 2004 to the end of 2007. In
otherwords,theSOXIndexunderperformedthemarketduringthosefour
years.
While the group’s absolute performance was flat, its relative perfor-
mance was weak. That raises an obvious question. Why hold an under-
performingassetwhenthere’smoneytobemadeelsewhere?Althoughno

COMPARING GOLD STOCKS TO GOLD
Goldsharesoftenrisefasterthanthecommodityinacommodityuptrend.
That was the case during the first four years of the bull market in gold
from 2002 to the end of 2005. That wasn’t the case, however, during 2006
and 2007 (see Figure 9.4). Here again, relative strength analysis comes
into play. Figure 9.4 plots a ratio of gold divided by the XAU Index from
2005 to spring 2008. The ratio turned up at the start of 2006 and rose for
the next two years during which time the commodity did better than the
shares. Not that the performance of gold stocks wasn’t good. The XAU
Index gained 35 percent during 2006 and 2007, which was twice as much
astheS&P500(17percent).Golditself,however,gained62percentduring
2006and2007.Thatmadethecommodityastrongerinvestmentthangold
shares during those two years. That may have been due to the launching
of exchange-traded funds that allowed direct purchase of the commod-
ity. Nonetheless, the use of relative strength analysis helped investors
hoping to profit from the bull market in gold to maximize their profits by
favoringthecommodityoveritsrelatedsharesfrom2006into2008.

HOW TO SPOT NEW MARKET LEADERS
It’s one thing to write about market leaders that have been rising for sev-
eralyearssuchasgoldstocksorstockstiedtocommoditiesingeneral.It’s
another thing to spot new emerging market leaders. And it’s usually not
that hard to do that. Figure 9.5 plots a relative strength ratio of the Con-
sumer Staples Sector SPDR (XLP) divided by the S&P 500 from mid-2001
to mid-2008. After rising throughout the bear market that started in 2000,
the staples/S&P 500 ratio peaked at the end of 2002 and fell until spring
2006,whenitstartedtobounce.Afterrallyingduringmostofthatyear,the
ratioretestedthe2006lowduringsummer2007andstartedtorisesharply.
The pattern tracedout bytheConsumer Staples ratiowas avery obvious
“double bottom” reversal pattern as explained in Chapter 3. That bullish
pattern was completed during fourth quarter 2007 when the ratio broke
outtoafour-yearhigh.Thereareseveralimportantmessagesrevealedby
thatRSline.
One message has to do with the nature of the Consumer Staples sec-
tor.Thegroupiscomposedofstocksthataredefensiveinnature.Inother

WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM
There are usually two parts to sector rotation. Money usually rotates out
of one market sector and into another. Figure 9.5 shows one part of the

denly attracted a lot of money and began a new period of market leader-

Sector SPDR (price bars) and the Consumer Discretionary Sector SPDR
(solid line). The interplay between the two market sectors is unmistak-
able.WhensubprimemortageproblemsstartedtosurfaceinJuly2007,fear
started to spread that contagion from a collapsing housing sector would
bringdownthestockmarketandtheeconomyalongwithit.Thatfearwas
reflectedina10percentdropinstockpricesduringthatsummer.
Another manifestation of that fear, however, was the rotation out of
consumer discretionary stocks (which includes retailers) that are consid-
ered to be economically sensitive into economically resistant stocks like
Consumer Staples. That was a clear message that investors were turn-
ing defensive for the first time since the bull market in stocks started in
spring 2003. The good news for the visual investor was that the rotation
that started in the middle of 2007 was easily spotted on the charts of the
twocompetingsectors.Figure9.6alsodemonstrateshowtheinterplaybe-
tween competing market sectors offers clues about the state of the stock
marketandtheeconomy.
SPOTTING ROTATION BACK INTO
LARGE CAPS
Another choice that investors have to make is whether to favor large-cap
stocks or small caps. Although both groups usually trend in the same di-
rection,theydon’tdosoatthesamerate.Inthesixyearsfrom2000tothe
middle of 2006, small-cap stocks rose 100 percent while large caps were
basicallyflat.Obviously,small-capstockswereabetterinvestmentduring

During the five-years from spring 2003 to the start of 2008, small-cap
stocks gained 97 percent versus 62 percent for large caps. Those figures
seem to support a continuing preference for small caps during that en-
tiretimespan.Frommid-2006toJanuary2008,however,largecapsgained
8percent versusa6percent lossforsmallcaps. Duringthose18months,
large caps beat small caps by nearly 15 percent. That’s the time period
that began with the upturn in the large-cap/small-cap ratio in Figure 9.7.

CHINESE STOCKS LOSE
LEADERSHIP ROLE
Chapter 7 touched briefly on the idea of using relative strength analy-
sis to determine whether foreign stocks or U.S. stocks were acting bet-
ter. A relative strength ratio of foreign stocks divided by the S&P 500
rose from 2002 through 2007 which favored investment in foreign shares.
That was due in large part to a falling U.S. dollar. That period of foreign
strength, however, ended in 2007. Relative strength analysis can be ap-
plied to a wide variety of exchange-traded funds that cover foreign mar-
kets. Relative strength ratios are especially helpful in spotting when a
foreign market is doing better and when it’s not. China is a good exam-
ple of a major trend change to the downside (see Figure 9.9). In the two
years starting in 2006, the Chinese stock market was by far the strongest
in the world. From the start of 2006 until the fourth quarter of 2007, the
ShanghaiStockExchangeCompositeIndexroseover400percent.During
thatsameperiod,theFTSE/XinhuaChinaiShares(FXI)rose250percent.
By contrast, the Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 35 percent. That
dramatic outperformance by Chinese stocks took a big detour starting in
thefourthquarterof2007.

subsequent numbers bore that out. In the twelve months following the
October peak, global stocks fell 40 percent. The Chinese iShares fell
50 percent. The sharp drop in the China/world stock ratio starting in

SUMMARY
Thewholepurposeofusingrelativestrengthanalysisistohelpinvestorsto
concentrate their funds in asset classes, market sectors, industry groups,
or individual stocks that are showing superior performance. A secondary
purpose is to avoid (or underweight) assets that are showing relatively
weak performance. Relative strength (or ratio) analysis is the best way
to compare any two entities for the purpose of measuring their relative
performance.Ratioanalysiscancomparetwoassetclasses(suchascom-
modities versus bonds or bonds versus stocks), stock sectors versus the
broadermarket(suchasgoldandenergysharesversustheS&P500),com-
petingstocksectors(suchasConsumerStaplesversusConsumerDiscre-
tionarystocks),industrygroupswithinsectors(suchasoilserviceshares
versus the Energy sector), or individual stocks versus their sector or the
S&P500.
Ratioanalysiscanalsobeusedonaglobalscaletodeterminewhether
foreign shares are more or less attractive than those in United States,
and which foreign markets are showing the best relative performance.
Ratio analysis has an endless number of uses in comparing any two
financial markets. The top-down approach to investing means determin-
ingthetrendofthestockmarketfirst,thenisolatingbetter-actingsectors
and industry groups, and then the strongest stocks within those sectors.
It’s always a good idea to combine relative strength with strong absolute
performance.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SECTORS
AND INDUSTRY GROUPS
Standard&Poor’sdividesthestockmarketintoninesectorsthatarefur-
ther subdivided into 88 industry groups. There is a difference between a
“sector” and an “industry.” A sector is a much broader category such as
BasicMaterials,whichincludesseveralindustrygroupssuchasaluminum,
chemicals,copper,goldmining,paperandforestproducts,andsteel.Other
sectors include Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, In-
dustrials, Financials, Health Care, Technology, Transportation, and Utili-
ties. Each of those sectors has its own industries. It’s important to know
what industries are included in each sector and well as which stocks are
includedineachindustry.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor’s Equity
Research,haswrittenextensivelyonhowsectorsactatdifferentstagesin
the business cycle. The sector rotation model in Figure 10.1 is based on
therotationalsequencedescribedinStovall’sStandard&Poor’sGuideto
Sector Investing(McGraw-Hill,1996).CyclicalsandTechnologyareearly
cycle leaders while Energy is a late cycle leader. The latter is due to a
buildupofinflationarypressuresfromrisingenergyprices.ConsumerSta-
plesandHealthCarearefavoredearlyinaneconomic contraction, while
Financialsdobestlateinacontraction.

SECTOR CARPETS
One of the most user-friendly visual tools that I use to help isolate mar-
ket leaders is the market sector carpet. You won’t get the full impact
of the carpet here because it’s shown in grayscale. On your computer
screen, however, it’sincolor. I’m including itto alert you toitsexistence
and to explain how to use it. Figure 10.4 shows the S&P sector carpet
for the two months between April and June 2008. (You can adjust the
time period to one day, one week, or one or two months.) The boxes in

SECTOR TRENDS NEED TO BE

Keep in mind that sector trends need to be monitored on a regular basis.
Youcan’tjust“buyandhold”asectorlikeyoucanthestockmarket.What
workedduringonesix-monthperiod(orquarter)maynotworkduringthe
next. That’s where performance charts and market sector carpets come
into play. It’s generally a good idea to review those visual tools at least
once a week to see if some of the leaders are starting to slip in the rank-
ingsorifsomeofthelaggardsarestartingtomoveup.Alsokeepinmind
thatthesetoolsaresimplyscreeningdevicestoensurethatyou’realways
dealing with market leaders. The next step after that is to look at the ac-
tual charts of the sectors, industry groups, and individual stocks to see if
they’reactinginabullishfashion.
INFORMATION ON SECTORS AND
INDUSTRY GROUPS
Most of the group indexes used in sector analysis are listed as exchange
traded options on various stock exchanges. As such, the data is readily
available and easily charted. If you wish to know what’s in each index
(which is a good idea), the exchange where it’s traded is usually the best
source. The three biggest options exchanges are the American Stock Ex-
change(AMEX.com),theChicagoBoardOptionsExchange(CBOE.com),
andthePhiladelphiaStockExchange(PHLX.com).AlthoughthePhiladel-
phiaExchangehasthefewestlistings,someofitsofferingsareamongthe
most popular in the industry. They include the KBW Bank Index (BKX),
theGold/SilverIndex(XAU),theHousingIndex(HGX),theOilServiceIn-
dex (OSX), the Semiconductor Index (SOX), and the Utility Index (UTY).
SomeofthemorepopularstockindexestradedontheAmericanStockEx-
change include the Airline Index (XAL), the Biotechnology Index (BTK),
theGoldBugsIndex(HUI),theGoldMinersIndex(GDX),theNaturalGas
Index (XNG), the Oil Index (XOI), the Pharmaceutical Index (DRG), and
theBroker/DealerIndex(XBD).

SPOTTING NATURAL GAS LEADERSHIP
The AMEX Natural Gas Index was one of the stock market’s strongest
performers during the first quarter of 2008. Natural gas stocks gained
7 percent versus a 6 percent loss for the S&P 500 during those three
months. That being the case, natural gas would have been a good place

NATURAL GAS COMPONENTS
Stock pickers had one more step to take in looking for a marker leader
during first quarter 2008. That was to locate the strongest stock in the
natural gas group. The Market Carpet revealed that EOG Resources was
the top percentage energy gainer during those same two months. EOG
was also the most heavily weighted stock in the Natural Gas Index. You
couldhavefoundthatoutbygoingtoAMEX.comandclickingontheNat-
ural Gas Index. By then selecting “Show Index Components,” you would
see a list of 15 natural gas stocks in order of their relative weighting in
the XNG (starting with the biggest). EOG had a top weight of 8 percent.
The next five were Southwestern (7.9 percent), Devon (7.2 percent),
Apache(7.2percent),Chesapeake(7.1percent),andXTOEnergy(6.8per-

CBOE VOLATILITY (VIX) INDEX
Let’snotleavethesubjectofgroupindexeswithoutincludingtheChicago
BoardOptionsExchange(CBOE)VolatilityIndex(VIX).TheVIXisamea-
sure of market expectation of near-term volatility for the S&P 500. It can
be traded on the CBOE as a futures contract and an option. Most people
intheindustry,however,usetheVIXasacontrarymarketindicator—it’s
agoodone.
The most important thing to remember about the VIX is that it’s a
“contrary” indicator. That means that it trends in the opposite direction
oftheS&P500.Inotherwords,arisingVIXIndexisbadforstocks,while
a falling VIX is good. Figure 10.9 shows how well it worked in the eight
yearssince2000.
The solid line in Figure 10.9 is the VIX, while the prices bars are the
S&P 500. You can see their inverse relationship very clearly. After rising
duringthebearmarketthatstartedin2000,theVIXpeakedduringfourth
quarter 2002 (down arrow) just as the bear market for the S&P 500 was
ending. The VIX then fell for the next four years, which coincided with
risingstockprices.Inmid-2007,however,theVIXrosetoafour-yearhigh
(see circle) and signaled that the era of low market volatility had ended.
ThatupsidebreakoutbytheVIXduringsummer2007alsocoincidedwith
thestartofatoppingprocessintheS&P500.
Figure10.10comparestheVIX(bottomline)totheS&P500(topline)
from the start of 2007 through mid-2008. During July 2007, the VIX rose
above18forthefirsttimeinfouryears(circle)andcontinuedtoriseinto
August. That upside breakout coincided with a drop of 10 percent in the
S&P 500 during that same month (see arrows). A second VIX upturn in
October coincided with a second S&P peak. The third VIX upturn during
January 2008 coincided with another downturn in the S&P 500, which
pushed it into a 20 percent loss by mid-March. While each upturn in the
VIXcoincidedwithamarketdrop,eachpullbackintheVIXcoincidedwith

The VIX turned down sharply in March 2008 (see Figure 10.10) and

CHARTING ADJUSTMENTS ON
OPEN-END FUNDS
Some minor adjustments have to be made when doing chart analysis of
open-end mutual funds. The first has to do with the price. Only one price
is available on a daily basis—the net asset value (NAV) that is released
after the close of business each day. The NAV tells us what the fund is
actually worth, based on the closing values of the stocks included in the
fund.Thereisnoopeningpriceandnohighandlowrangefortheday.As
a result, line charts that connect closing prices are used in place of bar
charts.(Itisn’tpossibletoconstructcandlestickchartseitherbecausethat
techniquerequiresanopeningpricealongwithhighandlowprices).
Virtually all of the indicators described in this book can still be used
becausetheyarebasedprimarilyonclosingprices.(Oneexceptionisthe
stochasticsoscillator,whichusesthedailypricerange.)TheRSIoscillator,
however, can still be used to measure overbought and oversold readings.
Traditional momentum and rate of change (ROC), as well as the MACD
indicators, can also be used. Volume analysis, however, isn’t possible on
open-fund mutual funds. That’s because volume figures are not released

broad index funds and the ability to divide the market up into categories
basedonsize(smallcapversuslargecap),style(growthversusvalue),or
region (domestic versus foreign). There are a wide variety of bond funds
to choose from as well. In addition, there are a large number of sector
mutual funds for investors who wish to fine-tune their stock portfolios
even further. Our interest in this chapter lies mainly with sector funds.

housing sector had a very bad 2007. In fact, this particular housing fund
fell30percentfromitsJune2007hightoitsJanuary2008low.Thatmade
it one of that year’s weakest sector funds. The visual investor could have

NATURAL GAS BREAKOUT
Figure 11.2 shows the Fidelity Select Natural Gas Fund from mid-2005
through spring 2008. The main focus on that chart is the very obvious
bullishbreakoutthattookplaceduringspring2007.DuringApril,thefund
rose above its spring 2006 highs to achieve a bullish breakout. As further
confirmationofthatbullishmove,thefunddippedrightbacktoitsbreak-
outpointduringAugust(seecircle)beforeresumingitsuptrend.Thatcon-

several chart indicators also confirmed that bullish action in the natural

Figure 11.3 is a good example of that. That figure charts the Fidelity Se-

the fund over a three-and-half-year period starting with 2005. From mid-
2005 to mid-2007, the bond yield fund rose steadily for a two-year gain of
15 percent. Treasury prices fell during those two years and most tradi-

Oneof thenewer developments inthemutual fundindustry has been the
ability to participate in the trend of the U.S. dollar. Even better is the
availability of mutual funds that allow you to profit not only from a ris-
ing dollar, but a falling dollar as well. The latter is an inverse fund that

COMMODITY MUTUAL FUNDS
Just a decade ago, it was pretty difficult for the average investor to buy
commodities outside of the futures markets. Largely as the result of the
major uptrend in commodity markets that started in 2002, a number of
commodity mutual funds have appeared. One of the first of such funds is
thePIMCOCommodityRealReturnFund(PCRAX).Thisfundisdesigned
tomimictheDowJonesAIGCommodityIndex,andFigure11.13plotsthe
PIMCO over the three-year period starting in 2005. A bullish breakout in
October 2007 reflected a flood of money moving out of stocks during the
subprime mortgage crisis. Commodity mutual funds were the big benefi-
ciaries of that major asset allocation switch. Figure 11.13 shows that the
2007 bullish breakout in the PIMCO commodity fund was pretty easy to
spot(seecircle).
INVERSE STOCK FUNDS
Bear(orinverse)fundsallowinvestorstomakemoneyinfallingmarkets.
Fund families like ProFunds and Rydex Investments offer a wide assort-
ment of bear funds that cover domestic and foreign stock markets. Many
of them are called ultra funds which move 150 percent to 200 percent as
far as their underlying index. One such fund is the Rydex Inverse Russell
20002XStrategyFund(RYIZX).

is the biggest ETF player with 52 percent of the market. Some smaller

Mutualfundsstillofferthesimplestwayformostinvestorstoparticipatein

some place in an investor’s arsenal of trading vehicles. That’s especially
true for investors who take a more active role in managing their assets.
That’sbecauseETFsoffersomeadvantagesovertraditionalmutualfunds.
For one thing, ETFs are considered to be less expensive and more tax-
efficientthanmutualfunds.ThemainadvantageofETFs,however,iswhat
theycandobetterthantraditionalmutualfundsfromatradingstandpoint.
Most importantly, ETFs trade like any other stock on a major stock ex-
change.Thatmeansthatallofthevisualtoolsdescribedinthisbookcanbe
used. That allows more active investors to take quicker positions in the
financial markets and then exit those positions when they wish to do so.
That’s especially important in commodity and currency markets as well
asmarketsectorsandindustrygroupsthattendtochangedirectionmore

Mutual funds discourage frequent trading and penalize investors who
attempt to do so. “Market timing” are bad words in the mutual fund in-

USING ETFs TO HEDGE
Exchange-traded funds can be especially helpful for those investors who
don’t like disturbing their core stock market holdings during market sell-

TRADING THE NASDAQ 100
One of the most popular exchange-traded funds is the PowerShares
QQQ Trust (QQQQ), which is based on the Nasdaq 100, which includes
the 100 largest stocks in the Nasdaq market. An equally popular com-
panion is the PowerShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), which trends in the
oppositedirection.Figure12.2plotstheQQQQoveratwo-yearperiodsur-
rounding 2007. The solid line is a 200-day moving average. Although the
200-day average is a relatively slow moving indicator, it still proved use-
ful in defining the major trend. The QQQQ rose above the 200-day line in
September2006andstayedaboveituntilthestartof2008.Manytradersuse
the Power Shares QQQ Trust as a proxy for the technology sector (since
it’s dominated by large technology stocks). The rising trend showed that

USING SECTOR ETFs
NinesectorSPDRsaretradedontheAmericanStockExchange(AMEX),
whichaccountfortheninesectorsthatareincludedintheS&P500.They
include Consumer Staples (XLP), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Energy
(XLE), Financials (XLF), Health Care (XLV), Industrial (XLI), Materials
(XLB),Technology(XLK),andUtilities(XLU).Theseareamongthemost
actively traded vehicles in the ETF universe and, as such, are very suit-
able for visual market analysis. All of the visual tools explained in this
bookcanbeusedonthem,includingvolumeandrelativestrengthanalysis.
As explained in earlier chapters, some of those sectors do better than
others at various stages in the business cycle. In addition, some of them
have generally negative correlations. In other words, some of them fall
when others rise. From the start of 2007 to spring 2008, for example,
Energy and Materials stocks rose 44 percent and 27 percent respectively
andwerethemarket’stwostrongestsectors.Thatwasmainlyduetorising
commodityprices.
Rising commodity prices, which carry inflationary implications, are
usually bad for financial and consumer discretionary stocks, which in-
clude Retailers and Homebuilders. Not surprisingly, those two weak sec-
tors lost 26 percent and 14 percent respectively over the same time span.
Retailersareespeciallyvulnerabletorisingenergypricesandfallinghome

ingthatsametimespan,theS&Pwasaboutunchanged.Thefactthatthe

In late spring 2008, the stock market was trading at about the same
level as it started the year before. A lot was happening beneath the sur-
face, however. Commodity-related ETFs were gaining ground, while con-
sumerdiscretionaryandfinancialstocksweresufferingbiglosses.Theas-
tute investor could have benefited by being in the former and out of the
latter. Figure 12.4 plots a relative strength ratio of the Materials Sector

The rising ratio testifies to the superior performance of that commodity-
relatedETF.OnlyenergysectorETFs(OIHandXLE)turnedinastronger

An investor armed with some charts (and knowledge of how to read
them) should have been in those ETFs tied to rising commodities. The

USING TECHNOLOGY AS A
MARKET INDICATOR
Earlier in the book I suggested using the action of some market sectors
to tell us something about the health of the overall stock market. One
of those sectors is Technology. Figure 12.6 plots a ratio of the Technol-
ogy SPDR (XLK) divided by the S&P 500 SPDRs (SPY) over the span of a
year.Therisingratiofromspring2007toOctobershowedTechnologyhelp-
ingtosupport arisingstock market. Afterpeaking inOctober 2007, how-
ever,theTechnology/S&P500ratiodroppeduntilitbrokearisingtrendline
atthestartof2008.ItcontinueddroppinguntilMarchofthatyear.During
thefivemonthsthattheratiofell,Technologystockslost22percentwhile
theS&P500fell16percent.
TheratioinFigure12.6offerstwomessages.Oneisthatthedirection
of the XLK/SPY ratio tells us whether or not Technology is a good place
tobeatanygiventime(thatis,whentheratioisrising).Mostof2007was
a good time to be in Technology. The first few months of 2008 were not.

commodities outside of the futures markets. That’s no longer the case.

BOND ETFs
Less than a dozen bond ETFs were on the market during 2007. By first
quarter 2008, that number had expanded to 58. ETFs covering municipal
bonds were introduced by Barclays Global Investors, State Street Global
Advisors, and Van Eck Global. ProShares introduced two inverse bond
funds, ProShares UltraShort Lehman 7–10 Year Treasury ETF (PST) and
ProShares Ultra Short Lehman 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TBT). During
October 2007, the Lehman International Treasury Bond ETF (BWX) was
also launched. Bond exchange-traded funds are offered along the entire
yield curve. They include the 1–3 Year T-Bond Fund (SHY), the 3–7 Year
T-Bond Fund (IEI), the 7–10 Year T-Bond Fund (IEF), and the 20+ Year
T-Bond Fund (TLT). Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are covered
byabondETF(TIP).

out of stocks during a period of economic stress usually moves into the
relatively safety of Treasuries. That makes bond ETFs a relatively easy
way to cushion one’s stock portfolio in a falling stock market. Inverse

of 2007, the S&P 500 doubled in price (+100 percent). Foreign developed

ing markets quadrupled the S&P 500 performance (+400 percent). As ex-
plained earlier in the book, a lot of the foreign gains came from a falling
dollar, which makes foreign investments more attractive to American in-
vestors and American markets less attractive to foreigners. Fortunately,

SUMMARY
This chapter covers the explosive growth of exchange-traded funds since
2000, which have revolutionized the world of trading and investing. Not
only are they cheaper than traditional mutual funds, ETFs allow more
frequent trading and are more easily charted. ETFs offer the best of two
worlds.Theyofferbaskettradingsimilartowhatyoucangetthroughmu-

that makes the transition to ETFs much easier. Sector trading, which is

Conclusion
WHY IT’S CALLED VISUALINVESTING
This book was written with a number of goals in mind. One was to intro-
ducethereadertovisualinvestingbyexplaininginsimplelanguagesome
ofthechartingtechniquesthatprofessionalshaveusedfordecades.Asec-
ondgoalwastoshowhowtousethesevisualtoolsforallofthefinancial
marketsthatincludecommodities,currencies,bonds,andstocksonboth
adomesticandaglobalscale.Anemphasishasbeenplacedonusingvisual
tools to implement asset allocation and sector rotation strategies primar-
ilythroughmutualfundandexchange-tradedfunds.Callingthisapproach
“visual investing” has two reasons. First, that’s just what it is. We look at
pictures of markets. The pictures tell us what a market is actually doing.
They tell us whether a market is going up or down. That’s all that really
matters.“Why”amarketisgoingupordownisn’tthatimportant.
THE MEDIA WILL ALWAYS TELL
YOU WHY LATER
You can pick up your newspaper, turn on your television, read your fa-
voritefinancialwebpageandlearnwhymarketsdidwhattheydidtheday
before.Thereasonsseemclearandreasonable.There’sonlyoneproblem.
Ifthereasonsweresoclear,thenwhyweren’tyoutoldaboutthemwhile
you still had time to act (like the day before yesterday). The main reason
theydon’twarnyouisthatmediaexpertsusuallydon’tknowthereasons
beforehand. When I worked as the technical analyst for CNBC, I used to
get frustrated watching guests explain how a market trend developed be-
cause those same guests had often been wrong on that trend. I used to
ask the producers why they didn’t find guests who got it right. I’d rather
hear from someone who got it right than someone who got it wrong. I
would also prefer hearing the analysis while something is happening (or
before)ratherthanafterthefactwhenit’stoolatetodoanythingaboutit.

MEDIA VIEWS KEEP SHIFTING
Media explanations also have an annoying way of shifting with market
trends.At10:00inthemorning,youmaybetoldthataneconomicreportis
bullishwhilethemarketisrising.Afterthemarketcloseslowerthatsame
day, you may be told at 5:00 P.M. that the same report that was bullish at
10:00 A.M. was really bearish “on closer examination.” (Shame on you for
not knowing that when you invested your money on their earlier report.)
There’saworldofdifferencebetween“predicting”and“reporting”.Report-
ing on market trends after the fact is interesting but not very helpful. By
usingthevisualtoolsdescribedinthisbook,you’llbeabletospotmarket
trends and act on them long before the media gets around to explaining
to you why they happened. While they explain what happened yesterday,
you’llbebusystudyingyourchartsfortrendsthatmaydeveloptomorrow.
Youwon’tneedthoseso-calledexpertsanymore.
VISUAL ANALYSIS IS MORE
USER FRIENDLY
The second reason for using the term visual analysis is to lessen the
intimidatingeffectthatthisformofanalysishashadonmanyinvestorsin
thepast,underthegeneralheadingof“technicalanalysis.”Manyinvestors
are turned off by exotic-sounding terminology and incorrectly assume
that the techniques aretoo difficult tograsp. By calling it what it actually
is—visual analysis—we hope to encourage a wider understanding and
appreciationofthesevaluabletoolsamongtheinvestingpublic.Everyone
looksatcharts.Economistslookatchartsofeconomicindicators.Security
analysts look at charts of earnings. Even the Fed looks at charts. Why
shouldn’tyou?Ifyouaregoingtolookatcharts,however,makesureyou

THE STOCK MARKET LEADS
THE ECONOMY
Thebiggestproblemeconomistsfaceisthattheydealwitholddata.Most
economic reports tell us what happened last month or last quarter. They
tell us nothing about the future (or the present for that matter). The fi-
nancial markets, by contrast, are forward looking. The stock market an-
ticipates economic trends at least a half year into the future. The reason

282 THEVISUALINVESTOR
we can’t use economic forecasting to predict the direction of the stock
market is because turns in the stock market “precede” turns in the econ-
omy. Historically, the stock market peaks six to nine months before the
economy. It also bottoms while the economy is in the midst of a reces-
sion. The stock market has an excellent track record in leading turns
in the economy—although not every market downturn results in an eco-
nomicdownturn,everyeconomicdownturnhasbeenprecededbyamar-
ket downturn. That being the case, it makes more sense to use the stock
markettopredicttheeconomythantheotherwayaround.That’sbecause
you can’t use a lagging indicator (like the economy) to predict a leading
indicator (like the stock market). So don’t worry too much about what
economistssay.Followthemarketinstead.
PRICES LEAD THE FUNDAMENTALS
Market prices are leading indicators of fundamental information. That’s
whythemarketiscalledadiscountingmechanism.Howmanytimeshave
youheardonTV,seenonline,orreadinthepressthatastock(orindustry
group)isfundamentallystrongwhileitspriceisfalling?Thereisusuallya
goodreasonwhyastockpriceisfalling,whichisthatthemarketbelieves
its fundamentals to be bearish. (If the stock price is rising, the market is
saying that its fundamentals are bullish.) Wall Street analysts who tell us
different are really saying that they’re right and the market is wrong. The
market is rarely wrong. I’d rather bet on the market than the opinions of
WallStreetanalysts.
Thestockmarketisbasedonthelawsofsupplyanddemand.Ifthede-
mand for a stock (or any market) exceeds its supply, the price will rise.
If supply exceeds demand, the price will drop. If the price of a market
is rising, chances are good that its fundamentals are bullish. If the price
is falling, the fundamentals probably aren’t very good. Chart analysis is
a shortcut form of fundamental analysis. The price trend of a market re-
vealed on a chart tells us a lot about its fundamentals. Rather than using
fundamentaldatatopredictthetrendofamarket,itmakesmoresenseto
usethepricetrendtopredictthefundamentals.Sodon’tbefooledthenext
timeyouhearsomeonesay,“Thetechnicalsmaybebadbutthefundamen-
talsaregood.”Ifthetechnicalsarebad,thefundamentalsareprobablyjust
as bad. If you’re looking for a market with good fundamentals, find one
that’sinanuptrend.

downapproach. Thefirststepistodeterminethedirectionofthemarket

bystudyingchartsofthemajormarketindexesandvariousmarketbreadth
indicators.That,however,isonlythefirststep.Oneofthemostimportant
ideasthatI’veemphasizedinthisbookistheimportanceofsectoranalysis.
There is so much that goes on beneath the surface of the stock market
having to do with sector and industry group rotation. As we’ve shown in
previouschapters,manymarketgroupsoftentrendinoppositedirections.
Somearemarketleadersandothersaremarketlaggards.
An investor can dramatically increase his or her overall performance
by concentrating funds in stock groups that are market leaders and
avoiding groups that are showing relatively weak market performance.
Stock pickers would also do well to concentrate their stock picks in the
market’s strongest groups. Sector trends, however, are usually shorter in
duration than major stock market trends. Because of that, sector trends
need to be monitored more frequently. The good news is that the visual
tools explained in this book make it relatively easy to spot those sector
rotations. I happen to believe that sector work is one of the best ways to
utilizethosechartingtools.
EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS
Theexplosivegrowthofexchange-tradedfundsoverthepastfewyearshas
greatly simplified our ability to track and trade all financial markets. The
ability to move quickly into or out of market sectors and industry groups
can now be done with one or two trades. Asset allocation shifts between
stocks,bonds,commodities,andcurrenciescanalsobedonewithrelative
ease.That’sbeenespeciallyhelpfulinrecentyearswhennontraditionalas-

The U.S. stock market peaked on October 9, 2007. By the following Oc-
tober, the warning signs shown on the charts during 2007 had come
to fruition. Global stock markets were in major bear trends and global
economies appeared headed into a global recession. Subprime mortgage
problems that had surfaced the previous summer in the U.S. pushed

Then things got worse as subprime problems spread to Europe. A
week after the U.S. bailout, Britain announced a bank bailout of its own.
Overnight bank lending rates had risen to record highs which froze the
global financial system. Stock markets around the world were in freefall.
The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and four other central
banks lowered interest rates in an unprecedented coordinated effort to
ease the economic effects of the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression.
BythesecondweekofOctober2008,theS&P500hadlostmorethan

What is Technical Analysis?
Technical Analysis is the forecasting of future financial price movements based on an examination of past price
movements. Like weather forecasting, technical analysis does not result in absolute predictions about the future. Instead,
technical analysis can help investors anticipate what is “likely” to happen to prices over time. Technical analysis uses a
wide variety of charts that show price over time.

in fourth quarter 2007. The BPI sector readings also contained valuable
information. The weakest sectors were Finance (25 percent), Industrial
(34 percent), and Consumer Discretionary (39 percent). Those numbers
confirmed that financial and consumer discretionary stocks were still the
market’s weakest groups. By contrast, the strongest group was energy
(81 percent). Other groups with readings over 50 percent were Utilities
(61 percent), Health Care (53 percent), Telecom (53 percent), and Infor-
mation Technology (52 percent). Three of those groups are defensive in
nature.
Earlier in the book, you may recall that readings in the NYSE Bullish
Percent Index ($BPNYA) well below 50 percent put it in bear market ter-
ritory; and that a move back over 60 percent was necessary to put it in
back into a bull market. Figure A.5 shows the $BPNYA rebounding from
oversold territory (below 30 percent) during first quarter 2008 before re-
covering to 60 percent in May of that year. Unfortunately, the $BPNYA
turned back down from that resistance barrier at 60 percent (see arrow)

McCLELLAN BREADTH INDICATORS
FigureA.6showstheNYSEMcClellanOscillatorandSummationIndexes
as they looked on DecisionPoint.com on June 18, 2008. The two indi-
cators (developed by Sherman and Marian McClellan) measure market
breadthandaremeanttobeusedtogether.TheNYSEMcClellanOscillator
(second line from top) is derived from each day’s net NYSE advances
(the number of advancing issues minus declining issues). The oscillator
is derived by taking the difference between the 19-day exponential mov-
ing average (EMA) and the 39-day EMA of the net NYSE advances. When
the shorter EMA crosses above the longer, it signals that the short-term
breadthmomentumhasturnedpositive.Whenthathappens,theoscillator
crossesaboveitszeroline.Crossingsbelowthezerolinesignalthatshort-
term breadth momentum is weakening. As the explanation implies, the
McClellanOscillatorisashort-termtradingtool.
The Summation Index is a longer-range version of the oscillator. The
Summation Index (dotted line) rises when the oscillator is above its zero
line and falls when the oscillator is negative. The Summation Index mea-
sureslong-termmarketbreadth.FigureA.6showsoneyearfromtheJune

Candlestick Pattern Dictionary
Abandoned Baby: A rare reversal pattern characterized by a gap followed by a Doji, which is then followed by another gap
in the opposite direction. The shadows on the Doji must completely gap below or above the shadows of
the first and third day.
Dark Cloud Cover: A bearish reversal pattern that continues the uptrend with a long white body. The next day opens at a
new high then closes below the midpoint of the body of the first day.
Doji: Doji form when a security’s open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and lower shadows can vary,
and the resulting candlestick looks like, either, a cross, inverted cross, or plus sign. Doji convey a sense of
indecision or tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Prices move above and below the opening level during
the session, but close at or near the opening level.
Downside Tasuki Gap: A continuation pattern with a long, black body followed by another black body that has gapped below
the first one. The third day is white and opens within the body of the second day, then closes in the
gap between the first two days, but does not close the gap.
Dragonfly Doji: A Doji where the open and close price are at the high of the day. Like other Doji days, this one normally
appears at market turning points.
Engulfing Pattern: A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an
uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is
characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day’s body.
Evening Doji Star: A three-day bearish reversal pattern similar to the Evening Star. The uptrend continues with a large
white body. The next day opens higher, trades in a small range, then closes at its open (Doji). The next
day closes below the midpoint of the body of the first day.
Evening Star: A bearish reversal pattern that continues an uptrend with a long white body day followed by a gapped up
small body day, then a down close with the close below midpoint of the first day.
Falling Three Methods: A bearish continuation pattern. A long black body is followed by three small body days, each fully
contained within the range of the high and low of the first day. The fifth day closes at a new low.
Gravestone Doji: A Doji line that develops when the Doji is at, or very near, the low of the day.

hile candlesticks are the oldest form of charting in the world,
point-and-figure (P&F) charts are the oldest form of charting in
theUnitedStates.Firstdevelopedneartheendofthenineteenth
century, P&F charts predate the better known bar chart by several years.
After falling out of favor in the latter decades of the twentieth century,
P&Fchartinghasgainednewpopularityinrecentyears.Alotofthecredit
for that goes to the advent of computer charting and web sites such as
StockCharts.com that have made P&F charts more accessible to the in-
vesting public and much easier to use. Although most investors still rely
more heavily on traditional bar and line charts, P&F charts have enough
uniquequalitiesandadvantagestorecommendtheirusealongwiththose
otherchartforms.
Inmyview,thetwobiggestadvantagesofpoint-and-figurechartingare
precisionandsimplicity.Buyandsellsignalsareveryeasytospotandleave
little doubt as to their existence. The P&F chart does that by recording
successiveXandOcolumns.TheXcolumnrecordsrisingpriceswhilethe

THERE’S NO DOUBT ABOUT
P&F SIGNALS
Not every P&F signal is a good one. As is the usually the case, you need
totakeintoconsiderationthemajortrendofwhichevermarketyou’refol-
lowing. You shouldn’t follow every P&F signal blindly, especially if that
signal conflicts with your other visual work. The trick is to have as many
visual tools (including P&F charts) pointing in the same direction. How-
ever, when you are looking for some type of trading signal to confirm a
pricemove,youcan’tbeattheprecisionofthepoint-and-figurechart.The
