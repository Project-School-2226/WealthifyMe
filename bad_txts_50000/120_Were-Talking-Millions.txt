FOREWARD
by Richard Buck
When Paul Merriman first told me he wanted me to work
with him in writing this book, I said no thanks. I was happily
retired, and I feared that we would end up repeating ideas
about which we had already written.
My reticence didn’t have anything to do with Paul.
He and I have worked together since 1993. We have written
six previous books as well as countless articles and
newsletters. We’re good friends, we work well together, and
we’re often able to anticipate the other’s thoughts and
objections and preferences. We laugh together, and our
wives know that when we get on the phone, the conversation
may go on and on.
Fortunately, Paul persisted with the idea for this book.
For many years I’ve been a fan of his Ultimate Buy and Hold
Strategy for long-term investors. It’s the basis for how most
of my own money is invested.
At the same time, I’ve been reluctant to recommend that
strategy to people I know because it’s complex to put into
practice.
So when Paul told me he had found a way to capture nearly
all the benefits of the Ultimate Buy and Hold Strategy using
only two readily available mutual funds, I was very
interested, though skeptical.



==================================================
                     PAGE 13                      
==================================================

When he told me exactly what he had in mind and showed
me some of the data to support it, I immediately saw the
value. Fortunately, I said yes to this project.
While Paul and I were working on this book, I was delighted
to find its message easy to explain and describe to friends
and family members. That certainly seemed like a good sign.
Over the course of writing this book, Paul and I have
wrestled with numerous issues, including:
• How much data and detail will our target audience of
young readers tolerate?
• How much do they really have to know?
• How do we keep the specific recommendations simple
enough that anyone can carry them out, while still
accommodating all the variables?
Paul is a guy who likes to teach using numbers, tables, and
charts. Lots of them. I prefer to teach using stories, perhaps
reflecting my 30 years as a journalist.
As it turns out, we found a way to accurately describe this
strategy without resorting to large tables of numbers. You’ll
find small tables in some chapters, but each one had to pass
two tests: (1) does it point to something essential? and (2) is
a table the best way to make the point?
We have done our best to strike a balance, keeping the
message understandable and simple to implement while
giving you, the reader, enough information to have
confidence in our recommendations. You, of course, will be
the ultimate judge of how well we succeeded.
Writing a book with two authors can be awkward. Each of us
has lots of experience that we want to share personally. You



==================================================
                     PAGE 14                      
==================================================

deserve to know when something comes specifically from
Paul and when something comes specifically from me. How
do we do that gracefully when pronouns such as “I” and
“mine” don’t really work with two authors?
Our answer finally emerged when Paul and I realized that
almost everything in this book actually comes from both of
us, reflecting our agreement and rough-and-tumble
discussions about all of the material.
In the pages that follow, you will occasionally see material in
italics that’s clearly labeled as coming from one or the other
of us.
Everything else represents our combined thinking, and there
is nothing about which we disagree.
I hope you’ll read our Introduction. Like most of the chapters
in this book, I think it would satisfy the way my father used
to describe a speech or presentation that he liked:
“Mercifully brief!”

INTRODUCTION
WHY WE WROTE THIS BOOK
This book is designed to show you how you can change your
life by making a handful of smart choices. It’s a recipe for
potentially accumulating millions of dollars you can spend in
retirement and leave to your heirs.
There’s no magic here, just common sense.
If you want a complete understanding of risk, investment
theory, asset classes, or mutual fund analysis, this book
won’t give you that.
Our job in these pages is to provide simple explanations of
the most important things every investor should do—and to
give you relatively simple instructions on how to do them.
Your job is not to be a financial wizard or a lucky lottery
winner. Your job is to be a normal person who can and will
regularly set aside a small part of your income and stick to a
simple plan for the years before you retire.
Paul: Ever since the 1960s when, for a few years, I was a
fresh-out-of-college broker on Wall Street, I’ve focused the
majority of my time and energy on helping real people get
the most benefit from their investments.
Although I’ve spent a lot of time helping people with
substantial amounts of money, I’ve always been concerned
that not enough young people—perhaps like you—are on
track to accumulate the money they will need to retire
comfortably.



==================================================
                     PAGE 16                      
==================================================

That concern is what’s behind this book.
The heart of this book is 12 Small Steps with Big Payoffs.
Each one of these steps can potentially add $1 million to the
retirement nest egg of somebody who applies it starting in
their 20s or early 30s. These steps are well-known to savvy
investors and advisors.
But one thing is new: An action plan that applies them in a
single solution that can be carried out easily by just about
anybody who has a job.
We call this plan Two Funds for Life. It’s designed to make a
big difference in the amount of money you’ll have to spend
during retirement and eventually leave to your heirs. Exactly
how big that difference will be is impossible to say because
there are so many variables.
But we believe it’s reasonable to think this strategy could
easily double the dollars you have when you retire. The
difference could be much greater, especially if you
implement this strategy in your 20s.
You might benefit from knowing the origin of the Two Funds
for Life strategy. So here’s the short history.
The very best way to invest for the long term
Paul: In the 1990s, I found a way to assemble some of the
most powerful financial building blocks I’m aware of and
organize them into an investment portfolio that I called The
Ultimate Buy and Hold Strategy. There is nothing casual
about my choice of the word “ultimate.” It’s the very best
that I know. Period.
The two of us have worked together since then to make this
strategy available to investors.



==================================================
                     PAGE 17                      
==================================================

Based on the best academic research available, we believe
that strategy is the absolute best way for most investors to
achieve long-term growth in the stock markets. This strategy
is the basis of most of our own investments.
In a nutshell, this “ultimate” portfolio starts with the
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index, a stock market index
that tracks the stocks of 500 large U.S. companies. It then
adds equal portions of nine other pools of carefully chosen
types of U.S. and international stocks. (Stocks are also called
equities and signify ownership in a company.) Each “pool” is
an asset class made up of stocks with similar characteristics.
This portfolio has been an excellent long-term diversification
vehicle.
(Diversification is a defensive investment strategy that can
be neatly summed up as “Don't put all your eggs in one
basket.” In this book, diversification refers mostly to the
practice of owning more than one asset class.)
The result is a low-cost stock portfolio with massive
diversification that will take advantage of market
opportunities wherever they are, with about the same risk as
that of the S&P 500 Index.
There’s just one problem with this terrific strategy, and it’s a
big one: Putting it to work is neither easy nor convenient.
Here’s where Two Funds for Life enters the
picture.
There is no way to achieve this Ultimate Buy and Hold
Strategy portfolio with only one or two funds. It takes 10,
plus an 11th for investors who want or need a bond fund to
reduce risk, and that should include most people. (A bond
fund invests primarily in bonds and similar securities.)



==================================================
                     PAGE 18                      
==================================================

Paul: Some years ago, I investigated what it would take to
create a single mutual fund to capture all these asset
classes, but the costs and complexity were much too great.
Fast forward to 2017, when I met a fellow retiree who is
very good with numbers and research and shares my
strong desire to help investors. His name is Chris Pedersen,
and he accepted a challenge that seemed pretty tough: Find
a way to provide most of the benefits of the Ultimate Buy
and Hold Strategy using only two mutual funds.
(Mutual funds are a form of collective investment in which
money from many investors is pooled and invested in
stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, or
other securities under the direction of a fund manager.)
I wanted a solution that would take care of investors
throughout their lives, with very little attention needed from
them.
After much discussion of many potential variations, Two
Funds for Life emerged from that challenge.
Young investors today have access to some terrific tools that
didn’t exist when we started investing in the mid-20th
century. Information and historical data that once seemed
the exclusive domain of Wall Street insiders and their
wealthy clients are now readily available to anyone who
knows where to look for it.
This book references some of that information. More
important, it shows how to put those tools and that
information to work for you.
We believe that investors of all ages can benefit from the
approach outlined here. While the greatest benefits will
accrue to young investors who have lots of time to let their



==================================================
                     PAGE 19                      
==================================================

money grow, it’s never too late to give your retirement
savings a boost using the information and suggestions in this
book.
Even starting at age 65, applying these lessons could
potentially be worth an extra $1 million.
Economic pain and uncertainty
As we complete this book, unemployment and economic pain
are higher than they’ve been for decades, and the world is
facing a huge health and economic crisis that seems as if it
could continue for some time.
Jobs have disappeared, government financial support is
floundering, and many industries are imploding. Teachers,
students, restaurant owners, renters, landlords, travel
agents, health care providers, entertainers—all these and
many more are staring into a future that can feel
discouraging at best and depressing at worst.
In the summer of 2020, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome
Powell said that our economic future is “extraordinarily
uncertain” right now.
The bad news is obvious, and it affects everybody. Many
investors and potential investors may be thinking along the
lines of “this is just terrible.”
Later in this book, we strongly advise against timing the
market based on emotions.
When millions of people ask how things could get any worse,
that's often as close as you will ever get to a "buy" signal.
The good news is that at some point, things will clear up a bit
and people will feel more confident about the future. This is
where successful investing starts. As uncomfortable as it



==================================================
                     PAGE 20                      
==================================================

seems, based on our experience over more than 50 years,
this smells like opportunity.
Even if you can save only $100, we hope you will find a way
to do that and do it sooner than later. When the clouds that
hover over us dissipate, the stock market is likely to reward
those who had enough long-term faith to be invested.
It’s never too late to start. It’s never too early to start. And
there’s no shame in starting small.
What we want from you, our reader
Our goal is to get you to take action. If we don’t persuade you
to do something, then we’ve missed the mark.
What we recommend won’t take long to implement. We once
calculated that it takes roughly 16,000 hours to get through
high school and earn a bachelor’s degree. Experts say it takes
at least 2,000 hours to master a skill such as playing an
instrument or learning to fly.
If you’re enrolled in a 401(k) or similar retirement plan at
work, you can implement our recommendations in about an
hour—two hours at the most. That could be the most
valuable time you’ll ever spend.
That hour or two, plus maybe 30 minutes or so a year
thereafter, could be worth millions of dollars over your
lifetime.
Terminology
This work contains some terminology that is familiar to
many investors but can sound like insider jargon to lots of
people who could benefit from this work. Accordingly, you
will find a small glossary in the back of the book of terms and



==================================================
                     PAGE 21                      
==================================================

phrases that should help you follow along. We also have
made a point to explain concepts as we go.
We’ve tried to keep this book relatively short, giving you
enough background to know why we recommend each step,
without burying you in unnecessary details.
So whenever you’re ready, let’s roll up our sleeves and begin.

INTRODUCTION TO
SECTION ONE
The elephant in the room: inflation
In this book, we toss around a lot of pretty big numbers. Add
$1 million to your retirement. Retire with $1,932,520 at age
65 (cited in Chapter 2).
Numbers like that may seem like a fantasy that’s just too
unrealistic to take seriously.
Many young people today might be happy to contemplate
someday having investments worth even $500,000, let alone
millions.
We get it.
There’s an old saying that “numbers don’t lie.” But that’s not
always true.
Some of the numbers in this book may seem preposterous.
They aren’t. You just have to understand them, and that
means taking long-term inflation into consideration.
(Inflation is a gradual increase in prices along with a decline
in the purchasing power of money.)
For example, in the pages that follow, you will read
projections of 40-year investment returns that result in very
big numbers. But the reality of having $1 million 40 years
from now might fall short of your fantasies.
Forty years of actual inflation from 1980 to 2020 reduced the
purchasing power of $1,000 to slightly less than $300. So



==================================================
                     PAGE 24                      
==================================================

when you think about a figure 40 years in the future, if you
divide by three you may be somewhere in the ballpark of
understanding it.
When you’re planning for a very long timeframe at 3%
inflation, $1 million today will be worth about $228,000 in
50 years.
That may be the bad news. The good news is that if you
follow the recommendations in this book, your money is
likely to grow significantly faster than inflation erodes it.
If you achieve a compound return of 10%, which is
historically realistic for stock investments, and inflation is
3% (also realistic historically), your investments should grow
by 7% in actual value.
In that scenario, a one-time investment of $100 becomes
worth $197 after 10 years; in other words, it buys about twice
what it did when you socked it away.
Here’s what happens to that $100 over longer periods:
• After 20 years, it’s really worth about $387
• After 30 years, really worth about $761
• After 40 years, really worth about $1,497
Based on 10% investment returns and 3% inflation, those
numbers are real.
We haven’t tried to adjust the figures in this book to account
for inflation. But here are two things you should keep in
mind:
• First, the really big numbers aren’t as preposterous as
they might seem.



==================================================
                     PAGE 25                      
==================================================

• Second, long-term favorable investment returns can
greatly increase the purchasing power of every dollar
you save.
No matter what your age or how much money you save, that
is really worth doing.
Small Steps with Big Payoffs
In this section, we outline a dozen decisions, each one of
which is potentially worth at least $1 million over your
lifetime of working, saving, and investing.
Of course, $1 million won’t materialize out of thin air. You
will have to save money, invest it wisely, and give it time.
Furthermore, we’re not promising that these 12 steps will
add up cumulatively to $12 million. But if you make these
decisions properly and then act on them, you may someday
be counting your money in million-dollar increments.
We call these 12 Small Steps with Big Payoffs.
Your life is your own to plan, manage, and carry out as you
see fit.
We’ve narrowed the variables into a dozen important
decisions that you will make—whether or not you realize you
are making them.
These decisions aren’t necessarily easy, and you might have
noticed that the world isn’t populated with billions of
millionaires. But each one of these steps is simple to
understand and execute. Each one is (mostly) in your
control. Each one, all by itself, can have huge implications
for your lifetime financial situation.
Obviously, there are many other variables in your life in
addition to these 12. Luck (good or bad), mistakes, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 26                      
==================================================

unexpected events all play a big part in determining how our
lives play out.
What you can count on
We can tell you three things for sure:
1. If you make these 12 choices correctly and do your
best to carry them out, you won’t really need the
material in the latter parts of the book.
2. If you fail to make these choices properly, the material
in the rest of the book won’t be of much help.
3. If you make these 12 choices correctly and apply
what’s in the rest of the book, you will be among the
most successful investors of your generation.
Here are these 12 Small Steps with Big Payoffs:
1. Save some money instead of spending it all.
2. Start saving sooner instead of later.
3. Invest your savings in stocks instead of bonds and
cash.
4. Invest in many stocks instead of only a few.
5. Keep your expenses low.
6. Choose index funds instead of actively managed
funds.
7. Include small-company stocks in your portfolio.
8. Include value stocks in your portfolio.



==================================================
                     PAGE 27                      
==================================================

9. Don’t try to “time” the market or outwit it.
10. Invest using dollar-cost averaging instead of waiting
for the right time to invest.
11. Keep your taxes low.
12. Do all this in one simple step: Invest in a target date
retirement fund.
Some of the chapters describing these steps are quite short.
Others are a bit longer. In each case, we’ve tried to make the
most important points without unnecessarily belaboring
them.
That’s the overview. Now let’s dig in.

Small Step #1:
Save Instead of Spend
“Do not save what is left after spending;
instead spend what is left after saving.”
Warren Buffett
Of all the Small Steps in this book, this is in a way the
biggest. It’s by far the most impactful in separating those
who attain financial independence from those who don’t.
Two things are immediately obvious. First, you can’t save
and invest some of your money if you spend it all. Second,
you can’t save all your money; you’ve got to have some to live
(and enjoy) your life.
Based on the assumptions outlined in the introduction to
this section, to get a $1 million payoff from this Small Step,
you’ll need to accumulate $300,000 by the time you’re 65.
That’s not nearly as daunting as it seems.
If your investments grow at 8% annually, that requires
putting away about $62 a month starting when you’re 21 (or
$86 a month if you start at age 25, or $130 a month if you
start when you’re 30).



==================================================
                     PAGE 29                      
==================================================

This Small Step (saving money) is simple, but in a world
filled with constant messages that urge you to splurge, it isn’t
easy.
Young people have the best opportunities to let their savings
compound for the long periods of time that can provide the
Big Payoff. But many young people are saddled with
significant student debt in addition to the costs of
establishing households and families.
If you want to retire with adequate resources, you will have
to find some way to save. There’s no way around it.
Get to first base
We could go on and on about this topic, but it doesn’t require
much elaboration. Either you are going to set aside money
for your future, or you aren’t.
To do this, you’ll have to figure out and actually do whatever
it takes to “live below your means” and spend less than you
could.
We can’t overemphasize this point: Unless you delay some of
your gratification by saving instead of spending everything
that you have, you won’t even get to first base as an investor.
If you don’t see a way forward, there are people who will be
happy to help you, without cost or any conflict of interest.
There’s an international movement of people who support
each other in building their savings and investment assets
rapidly so they can retire early. The movement is known as
“FIRE,” which stands for Financial Independence Retire
Early. One of the best known organizations within this
movement is called ChooseFI, with the “FI” standing for
Financial Independence.

Paul: I have spoken to some of their local chapters and met
some of their key players. Without exception, they have told
me they are willing to share what they have learned.
At an online site called Choosefi.com, you can learn more,
perhaps find a chapter near you, join one of their Facebook
groups, leave a voicemail, or send a written message online
asking for help.
The bottom line here: You can take this all-important step.

Small Step #2:
Start Saving Earlier
Instead of Later
“You don’t have to see the
whole staircase to take the first step.”
Martin Luther King Jr.
The more thoroughly you apply this Small Step, the bigger
your Big Payoff will be.
On the next page you will find a simple table to make the
point.



==================================================
                     PAGE 32                      
==================================================

Table 2-1: Results of investing sooner, assuming an 8%
compound return.
Table 2-2 presents that same lesson from a slightly different
point of view. It calculates how big your one-time investment
would need to be, again assuming an 8% compound return,
at various ages to accumulate $100,000 by the time you’re
65.



==================================================
                     PAGE 33                      
==================================================

As the table shows, you can achieve a goal even if you wait a
long time before you start. But the longer you wait, the
harder it gets. And the curve is steep.
In the previous chapter, we said you would need to
accumulate $300,000 by age 65 in order to have a $1 million
lifetime payoff. The top line of Table 2-2 shows you could do
that with a one-time investment at age 20 of less than
$10,000 ($9,399, to be exact).
Obviously, most 20-year-olds don’t have an extra $9,399 just
waiting to be put to work. But consider the following:
This is getting ahead a bit, but the figure $9,399 assumes an
annualized return of 8%. In this book, we’ll show you how,
based on over 90 years of historical returns, you may get 10%
or even 12%. At 12%, you could start with about $1,830 at
age 20 and reach that $300,000 mark by the time you’re 65.
That lifetime $1 million might be easier to achieve than you
think.
Not to belabor the point too much, but there’s one more very
interesting way to show the value of early savings.
The first 10 years
Imagine you’re saving a constant $5,000 a year from age 21
to 65, a total of 45 years. That means that every 10 years, you
add $50,000 to your investments.
Assuming a steady 8% compound return, the ultimate value
of your first 10 years of savings will be much greater than the
value of the $50,000 you add in any subsequent 10-year
period:
• Your first $50,000 (the money you save from age 21
through 30) grows to 1,070,940 by your 65th birthday.



==================================================
                     PAGE 34                      
==================================================

• Your second $50,000 (your savings in your 30s) grows
to $496,050.
• Your third $50,000 (your savings in your 40s) grows
to $229,769.
• Your fourth $50,000 (your savings in your 50s) grows
to $106,428.
• Finally, your last five years of savings ($25,000) before
age 65 grows to only $29,333.
In this scenario, you wind up with $1,932,520 at age 65. The
majority of it, 55.4%, came from that first decade of savings.
For every $1 you saved in that period, you wind up with
about $21.40.
Contrast that with this calculation: Only about one-quarter
of your retirement nest egg came from the $50,000 you
saved in your 30s.
This scenario, of course, assumes constant returns of 8%
every year. Everything we know about the past tells us that
the future won’t be that neat and predictable. Returns will be
high some years and low in other years. Some years will be
positive, some negative.
But regardless of the returns you get, the advantage of saving
earlier is huge.
Is this decision worth $1 million? Here’s why we think so: If
you started investing $5,000 a year at age 31 instead of 21,
your nest egg at retirement would be only $861,580 instead
of $1.93 million. That is a difference of over $1 million.
So put time on your side, even if you have to start small. You
won’t be sorry.



==================================================
                     PAGE 35                      
==================================================

A semi-radical idea
Paul: Starting early makes such a huge difference that some
of my friends who understand this have actually loaned
money to their own kids to help them start investing earlier.
In one case I know, this meant a young woman could afford
to contribute to her company’s retirement plan and get the
benefit of a company match. In a couple of other cases,
young people used the proceeds of a parental loan to
contribute to a Roth IRA that started growing tax-free.
I made gifts like this to my own kids when they were young.
I told them that if they used the money for anything other
than investing, that was the last money they would ever get
from me (as far as I know, this threat has worked!).
You’ll have to decide whether you feel comfortable proposing
such an arrangement with your own parents.
But if you do, you should totally respect their financial needs.
Maybe you start by showing them some of what you have
learned in this chapter.
Then make a proposal that you think will be mutually
beneficial. If they have financial assets that are earning
relatively low interest rates, you could propose to pay them a
higher rate in return for a long-term loan.
It’s easy to get bogged down in details, but here’s one
possibility: You ask for a one-time loan to fund a Roth IRA
and promise you’ll pay it back, with accrued interest, in 10
years (when presumably you’ll have the income to afford
doing that).
If you repeated that arrangement every year until that first
payment was due (10 years, in other words), your retirement



==================================================
                     PAGE 36                      
==================================================

savings would get an enormous head start. And your parents
could look forward to 10 years of payments from you.
Here’s another possibility: If your folks seem to have ample
assets, you could propose that they give you an “advance” on
your inheritance, on which you would pay interest only.
Presumably, that interest might come back to you someday
in the form of an inheritance.
Your pitch to them: The money that you hope to inherit
someday will be vastly more valuable to you now than it
would be 40 or 50 years down the road. Maybe they’ll go for
it: Maybe they won’t.
But if nothing else, by showing them that you’re studying
this book, you’ll be demonstrating financial responsibility
and foresight. Most parents would be happy to see such a
demonstration.
(Just make sure you don’t come off as pleading with them for
money!)

Small Step #3
Invest in Stocks, Not Bonds
“An important key to investing is to remember
that stocks are not lottery tickets.”
Peter Lynch, manager (1977–1990) of Fidelity Magellan,
the number one growth fund at the time,
which compounded at 29% on his watch.
The basic divide in the investment world is between stocks
(we will sometimes refer to them as equities, and throughout
this book we’ll use those two terms interchangeably) and
bonds.
Here is the basic difference between equities and bonds:
• Equities represent ownership. When you buy stock in a
company, you own part of it. As a stockholder, you get
part of the benefits if everything goes right. At the same
time, you assume some of the risk that the business could
flop. Your payback takes two forms: First, you can sell
your stock to another investor; second, you can receive
dividends, which are distributions that some companies
pay to shareholders.



==================================================
                     PAGE 38                      
==================================================

• Bonds represent loans. When you buy a bond from a
company or a government entity, you are lending money.
You own a promise that the money will be repaid, with
interest, over an agreed-upon time. Your payback doesn’t
depend on whether the company does well or does
poorly. If you’re a bondholder, your risk is lower, and the
money that’s due to you will be repaid before the
shareholders get a dime. As a lender, you incur the risk
that the borrower could default, partially or completely.
“Given the choice between stocks and bonds,” said Warren
Buffet, “I would choose equities in a minute.”
Risk vs. return
Here’s the most important thing about this: Stocks have a
long history of being more profitable than bonds. But stocks
are also riskier than bonds.
What follows is an oversimplification of a complex and
important topic (but we’re seeking million-dollar decisions,
so let’s look at the big picture).
If you’re in your 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, or even your 60s, owning
stocks instead of bonds is potentially a million-dollar
decision. The more years you have before you, the bigger the
difference.
We don’t want to bury you with numbers, but here are a few
you should know.
Double your money
From 1928 through 2019, the average compound 40-year
return of long-term U.S. government bonds was 5.5%. At
that rate, you can expect to double your money about every
13.1 years.



==================================================
                     PAGE 39                      
==================================================

Over the same time frame, the average compound 40-year
return of the U.S. stock market (defined for our purposes as
the Standard & Poor's 500 Index) was 10.9%. At that rate,
you can expect to double your money about every seven
years (this assumes you reinvested any dividends you
received instead of taking that money in cash).
That’s a bigger difference than it seems. Over 40 years,
stocks would double almost six times, and bonds three times.
For an investor adding $5,000 a year for 40 years, the
historical 5.5% return of bonds would result in $683,028;
the 10.9% return of the S&P 500 would result in $2.83
million.
Need we say more? Well, yes.
Most investors are unlikely to be either 100% in stocks or
100% bonds for 40 years. A long-term return of 8% is
reasonable for a combination of stocks and bonds that
gradually moves away from stocks as the investor
approaches retirement. An 8% return over 40 years
(assuming additional savings of $5,000 a year) would be
worth about $1.3 million, roughly twice the return of an all-
bond portfolio.
Just about any way you look at it, using stocks for most or all
of your portfolio is likely to lead to an advantage of $1
million or more.
Why bonds?
So why do investors like bonds? In a word, safety.
Paul: I’m 77, and roughly half my investments are in bond
funds. This allocation reduces the impact of the ups and
downs of the stock market on my portfolio and gives me
peace of mind.



==================================================
                     PAGE 40                      
==================================================

Richard: I’m roughly the same age, and bonds make up
around 30% of my own investments.
But if you are in your early years of saving and investing, it
would be a huge mistake to use bonds for a major part of
your portfolio. What young people need is growth, not
“protection” from temporary stock market fluctuations.
However, stocks, also called equities, should be chosen well.
That’s our topic in Chapter 4.

Small Step #4
Own Many Stocks
Instead of Only a Few
“Don’t look for the needle in the haystack.
Just buy the haystack!”
John C. Bogle, founder of The Vanguard Group
One of the biggest mistakes that investors make—especially
young investors— is trying to win big in the stock market. It’s
easy to see the huge profits some people have made by
owning a few dazzling stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,
and Google, or for a previous generation, General Electric,
Johnson & Johnson, International Business Machines, and
so on.
But, you ask, with all the information now available, how
hard can it be to find the next winner and ride the market to
riches? Mighty hard, as it turns out.
It’s theoretically possible to get lucky. People who invested
$10,000 in Microsoft in 1986 and hung on were worth about
$3 million at the end of 1999. Easy money, right?
But if you were late to the party and didn’t buy Microsoft
stock until 1999, you unknowingly opened yourself up to a



==================================================
                     PAGE 42                      
==================================================

world of hurt. After just a few months you would have lost
more than half your investment.
If you were extremely patient (some people would say
stubborn) and kept that Microsoft stock, you would have
finally broken even—16 years later!
More is more
No matter how much you may want to try your hand at
picking future stock market winners, a much better idea is to
buy many stocks. That way, if any of them gets into trouble
and goes into a tailspin, you still have all the others. This is
called diversification, and it’s one of the most important
lessons investors should learn.
Still, more is more, and in this case, it’s also better.
In the old days, most lists of “best stocks to own” came out at
the end of a calendar year and purported to predict the best
performers of the upcoming year. Then in 1972, lists started
appearing of stocks to own and keep forever. The most
popular ones were called the “Nifty 50,” and the premise was
that these companies were so terrific that you’d never have
any reason to dump them for others.
However, “forever” didn’t last as long as many of those
hopeful investors thought it would.
Investors who bought the 50 “best” stocks back then and
held onto them have made considerably less money than the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index, a common proxy for the U.S.
stock market as a whole.
Over the long haul, owning 50 stocks is definitely better than
owning just a few. Owning 500 is definitely more
advantageous than owning 50. And as we’ll discuss shortly,



==================================================
                     PAGE 43                      
==================================================

owning thousands of stocks is hands-down better than
owning “only” 500.
Over the past 90 years, the U.S. stock market has grown
around 10% per year, though of course not in a straight line.
A landmark academic study that came out a few years ago
reached a startling conclusion: This 10% return could be
traced to fewer than 4% of all public companies.
On average, the stocks of the other 96% returned about 3% a
year, similar to the return of Treasury bills. If that pattern
continues—and we have no reason to think it won’t—then
your chances of finding a blockbuster stock are about one in
25.
That’s the bad news. The good news is that if you owned all
the stocks, you would have received that 10% return.
It seems counter-intuitive, but additional academic studies
indicate that investing in more stocks leads to higher returns,
not lower returns.
So, is this really a million-dollar decision?
We say yes, because we are dealing with probabilities. It’s
possible you’ll identify and invest in the next IBM or the next
Apple. But it’s not probable.
A bonus point that’s worth $1 million
or more
There’s another million-dollar piece of information lurking
here, and because you’ve waded this far into this chapter,
we’ll give it to you now, at no extra charge.
Getting back to our narrative about owning many stocks
instead of only a few, let’s suppose that your compound
return from owning many stocks is a mere half percentage
point a year more than if you owned just a few. The



==================================================
                     PAGE 44                      
==================================================

difference is likely to be greater, but 0.5% will let us make
our point.
Now assume you invest $5,000 a year from age 21 to age 65
in just a few stocks, and you earn 8% compounded annually.
Then you scale back your portfolio so it earns 6% for the next
30 years. You’ll presumably be withdrawing 4% of your
portfolio every year during that time.
(Four percent is generally accepted as an annual withdrawal
rate from your investments that’s likely to survive whatever
happens in the markets and to grow over time to at least
keep up with inflation.)
At these rates of return, 8% and 6%, you’ll have $1.4 million
by the time you’re 65, and after 30 years of retirement
withdrawals, your end-of-life portfolio will be worth about
$2.4 million—and that’s in addition to $2.2 million you will
have taken during your retirement. That total of about $4.6
million is not bad at all for investing $200,000 of your own
money. But it can be better.
As an alternative, let’s assume you take the advice of this
chapter to heart. You diversify your portfolio by owning
hundreds of stocks instead of only a few; assume this gives
you a compound return of 8.5% until you’re 65, and 6.5%
after that.
At age 65, you’ll retire with about $1.6 million, and after 30
years of retirement withdrawals, your portfolio will be worth
$3.1 million, in addition to retirement withdrawals of $2.7
million over 30 years—a total of about $5.8 million.
That’s an extra $1.2 million for you to live on and leave to
your fortunate heirs, and that extra came from a mere 0.5%
increase in your rate of return. And capturing that extra 0.5%
is easy, as we’re about to see.
That’s how a very Small Step can turn into a very Big Payoff.



==================================================
                     PAGE 45                      
==================================================

Owning many stocks is easy
Fortunately, owning hundreds of stocks is as easy as owning
only a few. You can do this by owning index funds, which we
discuss in Chapter 6. This will give you professional
management, broad diversification, and easy record-keeping,
all for very little cost.
For many investors, the notion that returns are higher from
owning more companies than from only a few is a hard pill to
swallow. It goes against the notion that hard work and
diligent study will be rewarded.
Putting your money in a single company is considered
speculation, while owning hundreds of companies is
considered an investment. Why? The single company carries
the huge risk that it could hit not only hard times but go out
of business or be acquired in a way that is not in the best
interests of stockholders.
This is called business risk, and it’s virtually non-existent in
a portfolio made up of hundreds of companies.
Even if you find it hard to get your head around the concept,
take our word for it: You’ll almost certainly do better if you
own many companies than if you own only a few.

Small Step #5
Cut Your Investment Expenses
“The two greatest enemies of the equity fund
investor are expenses and emotions.”
John C. Bogle
Want a really easy way to get higher returns? This is it.
No matter what you invest in (and even if you ignore all the
other advice in this book), every dollar you save in
investment expenses is a dollar that’s added to your return.
You won’t be able to eliminate fees and expenses entirely. It
costs money to keep your account records accurate, safe, and
up to date. It costs money to administer your investments,
and you want all that to be done properly. For that, you will
need to pay something.
However, unnecessary expenses and fees are your enemy.



==================================================
                     PAGE 47                      
==================================================

A leaky bucket
Imagine your portfolio as a bucket gradually filling up with
water. The water inside represents your wealth. Now picture
a tiny rupture in the bottom of the bucket through which a
little bit of water seeps out. That could describe the
investment expenses you pay.
Your job in this step is to keep that drip-drip-drip to a
minimum.
In the previous chapter, we saw that a difference of 0.5% per
year in return, when applied to a lifetime of investing, could
add up to about $1.2 million.
Trimming just 0.5% a year from your expenses would have a
similar outcome, and it’s easy to do. But lots of investors fail
to take this step, and they pay through the nose.
Consider two very popular actively managed U.S. mutual
funds.
Investors have parked $111.5 billion in Fidelity’s Contrafund,
which charges annual expenses of 0.85%, and $188.3 billion
in American Funds’ The Growth Fund of America, which
charges 0.65%.
Collectively, that means investors are paying nearly $2.2
billion every year in just these two funds.
Each of those funds is designed to outperform the Russell
1000 Growth Index, which is available in the iShares Russell
1000 Growth exchange-traded fund with expenses of just
0.19%.
But wait: The mutual funds’ active management should
provide higher returns to justify their higher expenses, right?



==================================================
                     PAGE 48                      
==================================================

As it turns out, exactly the opposite is true. Over the past 10
years, as we write this in the summer of 2020, Fidelity
Contrafund has underperformed its benchmark index by
1.5% a year, and Growth Fund of America has
underperformed that benchmark index by 2.6% a year.
If all those investors had put their money in the exchange-
traded fund we mentioned above, they would be saving about
$1.7 billion a year. That money would be working for the
investors instead of working for those fund companies.
(This lesson isn’t just about expenses. It’s also about actively
managed funds vs. index funds—the topic of Chapter 6.)
Aside from choosing funds with low recurring expenses,
there are some other ways you can cut your costs.
• Don’t buy load funds, i.e., ones that pay a commission
to a salesperson who signs you up.
• Avoid high-cost, high-commission products like
variable annuities.
• Pay attention to taxes (Small Step 11).
• Beware of funds that engage in frequent trading,
which incurs costs that can be cleverly hidden from
your view.
If you use these principles to guide your investments and
your behavior, you should have little trouble reducing your
expenses by more than 0.5%, and thus raising your returns
by at least that much.
As we saw before, that’s worth at least $1 million.
Another Small Step with a Big Payoff.

Small Step #6
Choose Index Funds
“Index funds have regularly produced rates of
return exceeding those of active managers
by close to two percentage points.”
Burton Malkiel, author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street
Index funds deserve a place among your very best friends.
An index fund is designed to replicate the performance of an
index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500. Some index funds
own stocks, some own bonds, and some own other types of
securities. But each one is designed to capture the
performance of a specific group of securities at a low cost.
By contrast, an actively managed fund typically owns fewer
stocks, anywhere from a few dozen to 100. Its goal is to
exceed the return of some particular index or benchmark. An
active manager picks individual stocks, hoping to find those
that will outperform the rest.



==================================================
                     PAGE 50                      
==================================================

If you can’t beat it, join it
In an index fund, the management isn’t trying to beat an
index, only to reflect it.
Index funds have lower expenses, even down to zero. On
average, according to some studies, actively managed funds
charge 1% higher expenses than their respective index funds.
That is twice the threshold for making this a $1 million
decision.
These higher-than-necessary expenses deprive investors of a
significant part of the returns they deserve for taking the
risks of investing—and the additional risks of active
management itself.
Index funds benefit investors in other ways: They have more
diversification, which means less risk.
They are usually more tax efficient since they don’t trade in
hopes of beating the market.
Their lower trading volume shaves the costs of trading that
are not included in expense ratios.
Index funds are available to track many types of stocks,
including growth- and value-oriented flavors of large
company stocks, small-company stocks, international stocks,
emerging markets stocks, real estate investment trusts, and
various types of bonds.
A $1 million winner
Although specific results vary depending on the type of stock
and the period under study, index funds outperform the vast
majority of their actively managed competitors. For example,
a 15-year study found that the S&P 500 Index funds did
better than 92% of all U.S. large-company stock funds. For

                     PAGE 51                      
==================================================

mid-cap funds, the figure was 95%; for small-company
funds, it was nearly 94%.
Think about that: Over 15 years, only a tiny fraction of
actively managed funds beat their benchmark.
To our way of thinking, an index fund that’s likely to wind up
in the top 10% of its peers—and does so while taking less risk
and charging less money—is at least a $1 million winner.

Small Step #7
Invest in Small-Company Stocks
“You can measure opportunity with the same
yardstick that measures the risk involved.
They go together.”
Earl Nightingale, American author and motivational speaker
Once again, let’s make sure we’re on the same page and start
with terminology. In the simplest terms, a small-company
stock represents a company that’s too small to be among the
giants of the S&P 500 Index.
Every Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook was once a
small company. When their stocks were first issued, they
were considered risky. What they all had in common was lots
of room to grow. We’re talking about growing A LOT.
Today, none of those companies would be even remotely in
the ballpark of a small company. That doesn’t mean they’re
bad investments. But it does mean they no longer have much
potential to double, triple, and quadruple in size every few
years.



==================================================
                     PAGE 53                      
==================================================

Small-company stocks DO have that potential, though their
names aren’t normally household names.
Vanguard’s Small Cap Index Fund owns nearly 1,400 stocks.
You can be forgiven if you don’t recognize these companies,
which are among the fund’s largest holdings: Exact Sciences,
IDEX, Atmos Energy, Zebra Technologies, STERIS, and
Leidos Holdings.
Investing in only a handful of small-company stocks is much
too risky: A failure and implosion of only one company could
wipe out a significant part of your portfolio. However, if you
own these stocks by the hundreds, it takes only a few very
successful ones to make up for many others that languish.
And if you own lots and lots of small-company stocks, you
will get a piece of the action when that next long-shot idea
explodes into success.
A long profitable history
As a group, small-company stocks have a long history of
success.
From 1928 through 2019, U.S. small-company stocks had a
compound annual return of 12%, compared with 9.9% for the
S&P 500. On a single $10,000 investment over a 40-year
period, a return of 12% would grow to $930,510, compared
with only $436,423 at 9.9%.
As we are about to see, such a difference is even more
pronounced when we compare actual 40-year returns of
small-company stocks with the S&P 500.



==================================================
                     PAGE 54                      
==================================================

40 years
Forty years is a long time, but a reasonable period for a
young person to evaluate investment returns. Heck, even
somebody who’s 55 may very well have a 40-year investing
future.
With this in mind, we obtained the data for every 40-year
period from 1928 through 2019 (there were 78 of them). The
average 40-year return for small-company stocks was 13.8%,
which would turn $10,000 into $1,760,721, nearly three
times as much as the S&P 500 ($650,009), which grew at
11%.
Another striking piece of data popped up in this study: The
worst 40-year period for small-company stocks was only
slightly below the average 40-year return of the S&P 500.
The fine print
As a bit of “fine print” to this discussion, we should point out
that there’s no official definition of exactly what constitutes a
small-company stock.
As noted in our glossary, small-company stocks are generally
regarded as having an average market capitalization of less
than $3 billion. (Market capitalization is the current share
price multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding,
or the theoretical market value of an entire company. Small-
company stocks are commonly referred to as “small caps.”)
As the basis of the statistics in this book, we use an index of
companies with an average market capitalization of $1.6
billion.
Large-company stocks have an average market capitalization
of over $15 billion.



==================================================
                     PAGE 55                      
==================================================

Our main point is that however you define them, over long
periods small-company stocks have a record of producing
higher returns than their larger counterparts. We think they
should play a significant role in your investments.
And if you adopt our suggestions for a Two Funds for Life
portfolio, they will!

Small Step #8
Invest in Value Stocks
“The secret to investing is to figure out the value of
something—and then pay a lot less.”
Joel Greenblatt: author, The Little Book That Beats the Market
Okay, you ask, what’s a “value” stock? Good question.
Recalling the previous chapter, just as a small company is
defined by contrast to a large company, a value stock is
defined in contrast to a growth stock.
A typical growth stock is likely to be one that most big
investors regard highly for various reasons. These can
include a top-notch earnings record and potential, a high
market share within its industry, outstanding management,
and stellar prospects. In short, a growth company is what
many people think of as an “excellent” company.



==================================================
                     PAGE 57                      
==================================================

Companies like this made it onto those “Nifty 50” lists in the
1970s.
Nothing wrong with that, right?
Right—except for one little detail: A popular stock like that is
priced accordingly. You’ll rarely be able to buy it at a bargain
price because everybody already knows everything good
about it.
We’re not saying there’s anything wrong with buying popular
growth companies. But read on.
The value of being “unexcellent”
Value companies, you could say, are “unexcellent” ones.
Often there is nothing fundamentally wrong with them, and
many of them have familiar household names and products.
But for whatever reason, they are not the darlings of
institutional investors.
• Maybe their market share is slipping, or their
products are on the way out, to be replaced by
something newer.
• Maybe they have suboptimal management, or they’re
saddled with debt or gigantic legal troubles.
• Maybe these companies just don’t generate enough
excitement among investors.
• Maybe they’re in for—or overdue for—a corporate
turnaround.
For these and many other reasons, value companies aren’t
nearly as pricey as the popular growth companies.



==================================================
                     PAGE 58                      
==================================================

Buy low, sell high
There’s less demand for value stocks. Less demand means
lower prices. Lower prices can mean bargain prices. Bargain
prices for value stocks let investors do what they know they
should be doing, i.e., buying low, as in the old saying “buy
low, sell high.”
As with small companies, value companies should be owned
by the hundreds, ideally in index funds. You’ll find plenty of
familiar names among the largest holdings of Vanguard’s
Value Index Fund, including Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson
& Johnson, Exxon Mobil, Proctor & Gamble, JPMorgan
Chase, and Bank of America.
Here’s a very valid question: How in the world could such
well-known companies wind up as relatively underpriced
bargains?
Stock indexes are built on statistics, not judgments or
opinions.
If you want to know where a stock falls on the scale of growth
(expensive) to value (cheaper), there’s a simple way to tell.
It’s called the price-to-earnings ratio, and it measures how
much investors are currently willing to pay for every dollar of
current profit.
Amazon vs. Bank of America
Let’s compare two well-known corporate giants: Amazon, a
renowned growth company, and Bank of America, one of the
country’s largest banks.
As we write this, Amazon’s stock price is 115.7 times its
earnings per share. That means investors are so confident in
Amazon’s future that they are willing to pay more than $115
for every dollar the company is currently earning. The
rationale: Future earnings will grow so much that in the
future, today’s price will seem like a bargain.



==================================================
                     PAGE 59                      
==================================================

At the same time, Bank of America’s stock price is only 10.2
times its earnings per share.
Those numbers, 115.5 and 10.2, are known as the
price/earnings (P/E) ratios of the two stocks. That ratio is a
reliable way to compare companies regardless of their size
and the industries in which they do business.
(As we write this, the P/E ratio of the U.S. stock market as a
whole, represented by the S&P 500, is 21.9).
So why buy value companies? Because you can buy them at
what may turn out to be bargain prices. If you buy value
stocks by the hundreds, through a mutual fund, they are a
good long-term bet for part of an equity portfolio.
Reliable data on value stocks goes back to 1928. An index of
value stocks from 1928 through 2019 had a compound return
of 11.1%, compared with 9.9% for the S&P 500.
Since 1928, value stocks were profitable in three out of every
four calendar years.
Savvy young investors should be more interested in 40-year
periods. And the news there is good. The average 40-year
return of large-company value stocks was 13.5%, compared
with 10.9% for the S&P 500.
That qualifies this step to potentially add $1 million to your
portfolio.
There’s no question in our minds that value stocks have
something quite valuable to add to an equity portfolio. And
they play a key role in our Two Funds for Life strategy.

Small Step #9
Buy and Hold
“I've said ‘stay-the-course’ a thousand times,
and I meant it every time.”
John C. Bogle
This step is especially easy because it tells you to do nothing
instead of doing something.
Well, maybe it’s not as easy as it sounds. Otherwise, why
would we even have to mention it?
From you, the reader, to us, the authors: Okay, how in the
heck can you argue that doing nothing is worth a $1 million
payoff? Have you already gone off the deep end so early in
the book?
From us, the authors, to you, the reader: Only our
psychiatrists know for sure!



==================================================
                     PAGE 61                      
==================================================

We regard this as a million-dollar step because if you don’t
follow it, you could easily lose $1 million over your investing
lifetime.
This is so important that we’ll elaborate a bit.
The opposite of buying and holding is sometimes called
market timing—and it’s what you should not do. It involves
buying and selling when you think the time is right to take
advantage of the market’s ups and downs.
Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of attempts at
market timing are counterproductive.
As you invest your hard-earned savings over the years, it’s all
but guaranteed that there will be times when you just
“know”—or at least seriously worry—that the stock market is
no longer a safe place for your money.
At those times, many investors will be bailing out of the
market and putting their money into the safety of cash or
bonds, or even Bitcoin or perhaps something entirely new.
Commentators will bemoan the economy’s weakness, and
you could easily come to believe that you should bail out too.
Don’t do market timing. Think about the possibility that
bailing out could cost you $1 million. Then just say no
thanks.
I just can’t take it anymore!
The most popular market timing system is one that we call “I
Can’t Stand It Anymore!” It kicks in when your portfolio is
going down and you’re getting nervous, afraid, or upset.



==================================================
                     PAGE 62                      
==================================================

Here’s how it often works:
Think of the letter “V” as representing the line of a graph of
the stock market, from left to right. The market starts high
then heads downward. You get nervous. It keeps going down.
When you look at the letter “V,” you can see that it has a
bottom point, after which the market changes course and
goes back up.
But in real life, you can never see that future. All you see is a
line heading straight down into an abyss. Your gloomy view
seems to be validated by all the attention it gets in the media.
When your emotional pain reaches the breaking point, you
get that “I Can’t Stand It Anymore!” feeling. You throw up
your hands, tell yourself you are “cutting your losses,” and
you sell.
Immediately you feel a sense of relief. As the market
continues to slide, you feel smart, and at the same time, you
feel sorry for all those suckers who didn’t have your good
sense.
But then at some point, the market reaches what looks like
the bottom of a “V” (usually it isn’t nearly as obvious as the
letter would make it seem) and starts to go back up.
What do you do now? If you knew that the market had hit
bottom and was about to head back up and reach (and then
exceed) its former peak, you would jump back in. But you’re
wary, and the financial media continues to make you
nervous. So you keep your money in cash.
As the market keeps going up, commentators gradually get
more optimistic. You see stock market gains on the news



==================================================
                     PAGE 63                      
==================================================

almost every day. You know people who say they’re making
money. You start to think you’re missing out.
But here’s the bald-face truth: You will get absolutely no
signal to alert you to the perfect time to get back in. In
hindsight, you’ll see that the very best time would have been
at the bottom of the “V.” But you’ll never be able to identify
that point until it’s long past.
What should you do? Finally, maybe even after the market is
well above the point at which you sold, you reach your
emotional limit. Biting your tongue, you buy back in—at
prices that are higher than they were when you sold.
You feel like a chump, but at least you’ll be able to benefit
from future gains.
Selling low, buying high
In the scenario we just outlined, your emotions lured you
into doing the opposite of what investors should do, which
is buy low and sell high. You sold your investments and then
repurchased them at a higher price.
That’s the problem with the “I Can’t Stand It Anymore!”
timing system: It gives you temporary emotional comfort,
but also long-term financial pain.
If you think we’re exaggerating, or referring to only a few
misguided individuals, consider this: A rigorous study of
investor behavior that’s been ongoing for 36 years has
concluded, time after time, that the average individual
investor fails to achieve not only the returns of the stock
market, but even the returns of the mutual funds in which
they invest.



==================================================
                     PAGE 64                      
==================================================

We wrote about this previously, and an online search for
“Paul Merriman” and the word “DALBAR” will turn up a
good article about how investors shoot themselves in the
foot, so to speak.
Here’s the summary: Studying investors’ decisions about
when to buy, sell, and exchange mutual funds, a Boston
research firm named DALBAR has found that investors,
often on the advice of their advisors and brokers, have given
up billions of dollars in gains by making short-sighted
decisions.
One key finding of the study is that investors who buy and
hang on are consistently more successful than those who
move in and out of the markets.
In its 2020 report, DALBAR said 20 years of data (2000
through 2019) indicated that the S&P 500 had an annual
compound return of 6.06%, yet the average investor in
equity mutual funds achieved a compound return of only
4.25% because many investors buy and sell instead of staying
the course.
In other words, actual investors earned only 70% of what
they could have earned very easily—by doing nothing at all.
It’s even worse
That’s bad enough, but the word “average” means lots of
investors did not even do that well. They thought at the time
they were doing the right things. But they weren’t, and they
paid a high price.
The lesson from all the data in this long-term study is crystal
clear: If you properly allocate your investments and then



==================================================
                     PAGE 65                      
==================================================

hang onto them through thick and thin, you are highly likely
to get above-average returns.
This doesn’t mean you’ll “beat the market” or the indexes.
But it does mean your returns will be above the average of all
investors.
A real-world demonstration
In what is sometimes called the Great Recession, this pattern
played out for many people, quite possibly including your
parents or some of their contemporaries.
The year 2008 was particularly distressing for the stock
market, and millions of people bailed out. When the market
roared back starting in 2009, they missed out.
Worse, as the market kept going up (eventually leading to
one of the longest and strongest bull markets in history),
their pain kept getting worse as they realized they would
have to pay increasingly higher prices for stocks.
Could have been much better
Many of those investors were so badly burned (by what they
would describe as the behavior of the market and what we
would describe as their counterproductive behavior) that
they never got back into the stock market at all and missed
the huge U.S. stock market opportunity of 2009–2017. That
10-year period didn’t include even one losing year, but it did
have seven years of double-digit gains and a compound
return of 15.3%, enough to turn $10,000 into $36,013.
Some people regard market timing as a defensive strategy
against bear markets. But a much better way to defend your
money is by holding an appropriate part of your portfolio in
fixed-income funds.

And if you follow our recommendations in this book, you will
do that. You’ll do it automatically and without having to

That way, you’ll be free to take this Small Step by buying and
holding.

question:
Is there ever a reliable way to “time” the market to your
advantage? As it turns out, there is!

Small Step #10
Put Simple Math to
Work for You
“With dollar-cost averaging, you take a lot of the
emotion and fear out of investing because where
the market goes in the short-term is far less
important to you, as long as you stick to a regular
investment plan.”
Nerd Wallet- a popular financial web site.
If the description of this step, “dollar-cost averaging,” makes
you think of some obscure formula that requires college
mathematics to understand, relax! If you’re regularly saving
money, this is easy to understand and easy to do.
The formula is simple: Set up regular savings, ideally
through payroll deduction or some other automatic method,
and invest the same number of dollars every time. That’s it.
That’s really all? Yes, that’s all there is to it.



==================================================
                     PAGE 68                      
==================================================

To see how it works, imagine that you’re adding $100 every
month to a mutual fund with a price that varies every
business day.
In the following example, we will exaggerate the potential
ups and downs of that mutual fund price so you can see how
this works in your favor.
The following table shows four monthly investments of $100
each at four different fund prices. Notice that when the price
is lower, your $100 buys more shares, and when it’s higher,
you buy fewer shares.
Automatic. Done!
This happens automatically with no thought or effort needed
from you.
Table 10-1: Dollar-cost averaging
Here’s what that bottom right-hand corner of the table
shows: You paid $18.69 for each share of that fund you now
own. That is noticeably less than the average of all four
prices ($19.25).



==================================================
                     PAGE 69                      
==================================================

Dollar-cost averaging won’t guarantee you a profit. It won’t
guarantee that the fund you invest in is a good one for you.
But this Small Step WILL guarantee that your cost for the
shares you own will be lower than the average of all the
prices you pay.
If you think this is sort of ho-hum, here’s a little story to
show why this can really, really matter.
Doing the impossible
For small-company value stocks, the 10-year period from
1929 through 1938 was pretty dreadful. If you invested
$1,000 at the start of 1929 and did nothing else, by the end
of 1938, you would have had only $480 left. Your loss would
have been 52%.
But if you had used dollar-cost averaging and invested $100
at the start of each of those 10 years, you would have ended
1938 with a profit. Instead of losing $520, you would have
made $524.
Why this huge difference? Mostly because small-company
value stocks had wild annual ups and downs. This made it
unlikely any investor would calmly keep investing year after
year. But for anybody who did, the year-by-year losses
provided opportunities to buy assets on the cheap.



==================================================
                     PAGE 70                      
==================================================

In 1933, 1935, 1936, and 1938, all the cheaply purchased
shares available after the declines of 1929 through 1932 were
there to benefit from huge double-digit returns.
This certainly is an unusual case, but it shows something
that’s well worth knowing: Regular investments using dollar-
cost averaging in a group of stocks with greatly fluctuating
prices can turn a losing investment into a winning one.
You probably won’t ever have to face a market with that
much volatility. However, this extreme example shows that
dollar-cost averaging (when it is coupled with a level of
patience that would have seemed wildly unreasonable) can
work wonders.
Though we don’t know the future, we can guarantee that
there will never be a reliable signal that tells you the best
time has arrived to get into the market. There will always be
signs of potential trouble ahead.
If you wait until everything looks positive, you’ll wait too
long for any bargains, and you’ll lose your greatest
opportunities.



==================================================
                     PAGE 71                      
==================================================

Dollar-cost averaging makes you more likely to succeed as an
investor by forcing you to buy more of an asset when the
price is relatively low.
In the long run, this practice rewards faith and discipline.
If dollar-cost averaging reduces or eliminates your desire to
tinker with timing your investments, it certainly could be a
$1 million step.
And if you’re regularly saving money through payroll
deductions, this is something you’re probably already doing
without having to even think about it.
Remember, we said this is easy!

Small Step #11
Minimize the Drag of Taxes
“A fine is a tax for doing something wrong.
A tax is a fine for doing something right.”
Anonymous
It’s been said many times: No matter what you do, you can’t
escape death and taxes. But you don’t have to overpay, and
that’s what this is chapter is about.
We believe everyone has a duty to pay their fair share of
taxes; it’s like paying your part of the rent.
But here’s a problem: Millions of investors don’t take the
trouble to think about the tax implications of what they do.
That neglect can cost a lot of money—potentially millions of
dollars for people with enough assets.
Taxes are complex, and the first draft of this chapter was
much longer than what you see here (you’re welcome).
However, there are a few basic principles you should not
ignore. At the end of this chapter, we’ll suggest one specific



==================================================
                     PAGE 73                      
==================================================

Small Step you can take that will cover most, if not all, of this
territory for you.
Two major issues might seem like technicalities when you’re
young and don’t have much money. But they will probably
make a big difference to you later.
One issue is the difference between accounts that are fully
taxed and accounts that get favorable tax treatment.
The second issue, assuming you open a tax-favored account,
is the difference between a traditional account (tax-deferred)
and a Roth account (tax-free).
Types of accounts
The first big divide is between taxable accounts and tax-
sheltered accounts.
You probably have a bank account that includes savings and
checking, and you might earn a little interest (probably very
little) on your savings account balance. That interest is
taxable income to you, and your bank sends you a form every
year telling how much interest income the bank has reported
to the Internal Revenue Service.
Similarly, you can open a regular investment account at a
brokerage firm or a mutual fund company, and the earnings
will be taxable to you every year.
These are taxable accounts, and as far as the IRS is
concerned, there’s no limit to how much you can put in or
take out. For short- and medium-term goals like saving up
for a vacation or a new car, these are the accounts to use.
But for retirement savings, you should put your money in a
tax-sheltered account such as a 401(k) or similar plan
through your work or in an Individual Retirement Account
(IRA). Ideally, you will do both.



==================================================
                     PAGE 74                      
==================================================

Because those accounts give you tax advantages, they come
with restrictions on how much (and when) you can add
money and on when you can start taking your money out
without paying a penalty. (If you take that money back
before you’re 59½ years old, you may have to pay a 10%
penalty.)
The main point to remember is that when you’re saving for
retirement, you should put as much money as you can into
tax-advantaged accounts.
Traditional vs. Roth
IRAs and 401(k) accounts come in two varieties, traditional
and Roth. The differences involve taxes and restrictions.
Inside either type, your investments will likely earn
dividends and capital gains.
Traditional
In a traditional IRA or 401(k), you invest money and take a
tax deduction for your investment. Add $5,000, then deduct
that $5,000 from your taxable income. Nice!
In this type of account, you will eventually owe taxes on all
the money that you take out. But in the meantime, you get to
keep all your dividends and capital gains working for you,
along with your own investments.
The advantage of this arrangement is that you can deduct
your contributions. If your highest tax rate is 12% and you
contribute $5,000, you get a tax break of $600. That means
the contribution effectively costs you only $4,400.
And though you’ll have to pay taxes someday on that $5,000,
that $600 you would otherwise have paid in taxes keeps
working for you.



==================================================
                     PAGE 75                      
==================================================

In the presumably far-distant future, when you are ready to
take money out of your account, whatever you withdraw will
be treated as taxable income. There’s still a potential benefit
to this because you could be in a lower tax bracket after you
stop working.
Roth
In a Roth account, you don’t get a tax deduction for money
you contribute. Sure, that’s a bummer! But it has a silver
lining: You will never pay taxes on anything you withdraw
from a Roth account, as long as you abide by a few
restrictions on when you take money out.
That means all the money you make inside a Roth IRA or a
Roth 401(k) is truly tax-free.
There’s another important benefit from a Roth account. It
might not seem like much now, but you are likely to
thoroughly appreciate it when you’re retired.
With a traditional account, the IRS won’t forget that you
have not yet paid taxes on the money you invested and the
money you earned. Eventually (currently the law says this is
the year you turn 72½), you will be required to withdraw—
and pay taxes on—at least a prescribed percentage of your
account balance every year. This is how the government
makes sure it eventually gets its money.
This rule is called a “required minimum distribution,” and
every advisor, bank, brokerage house, mutual fund company,
and 401(k) administrator is familiar with it.
But in a Roth account, there is no required minimum
distribution. None. Because the government isn’t going to
collect any taxes on what you withdraw, it doesn’t require
you to take any money out.
The upshot is that with a Roth account, you can keep your
money earning tax-free income for as long as you like. This



==================================================
                     PAGE 76                      
==================================================

gives you a lot more flexibility when you’re retired. It may
not seem like a big deal now, but we promise that if you have
that flexibility later, you will appreciate it.
To sum up this discussion, you have a choice of account
types:
• Taxable account
• Traditional IRA or 401(k)
• Roth IRA or 401(k)
That choice matters more than it might seem.
Choosing a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) will save you taxes in
the future. It is quite possible that tax rates will be much
higher in 40 years than they are now. That would certainly
magnify the value of having a Roth account.
A very smart step
Here’s the Small Step of this chapter: You don’t have to be an
expert on taxes. You just have to know one. When you’re
about to make an important financial decision, ask your tax
advisor: “Is there a potential tax trap here that I should know
about?”
Doing that could easily be worth $1 million or more.

Small Step #12
Use a Target date Retirement Fund
“Target date funds are a ‘set it and forget it’
retirement savings option that removes two
headaches for investors: deciding on a mix of assets
and rebalancing those investments over time.”
Nerd Wallet
We hesitate to call this a Small Step because its implications
are huge. In a way, it’s the granddaddy of the Small Steps.
And it comes with a grand bonus: If you take this step, you
will automatically do nearly everything that we have
prescribed so far.
Unfortunately, taking this step won’t force you to save
money, and it won’t force you to start saving early (Small
Steps #1 and #2). Those are up to you.



==================================================
                     PAGE 78                      
==================================================

But if you invest in a target date retirement fund, which we’ll
describe in more detail in Chapter 14, you will automatically
do a lot of the right things:
• You will invest in stocks (Small Step #3)
• You will invest in hundreds or even thousands of
stocks, not just a few (Small Step #4)
• You will have low expenses (Small Step #5)
• You will invest in index funds (Small Step #6)
• You will invest in small-company stocks (Small Step
#7)
• You will invest in value stocks (Small Step #8)
• You will avoid trying to time the market (Small Step
#9)
• You will get the benefit of dollar-cost averaging if you
buy this fund through payroll deduction or automatic
deposits to a savings account (Small Step #10)
• You will avoid high taxes (Small Step #11).
That’s a lot in one package!
So what is this miraculous thing called a target date
retirement fund?
Basically, it’s a mutual fund that invests in other mutual
funds and is managed to gradually reduce your risk of stock
exposure as you get closer to your planned retirement date.
What’s your target?
Every target date retirement fund has a year in its title. For
example, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund is
considered to be suitable for somebody who hopes to retire
within a few years of 2055.



==================================================
                     PAGE 79                      
==================================================

Typically, these funds are named at five-year intervals (and
managed accordingly). Vanguard, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price,
Charles Schwab, and others have funds labeled for target
years 2030, 2035, 2040, and so forth.
A target date fund will make sure you do most of the
important things well while you avoid the huge mistakes so
many investors make. You’re more likely to get where you
want to go if you use a target date fund than if you try to take
all these Small Steps on your own.
There’s more good news: If you follow the recommendations
in the rest of this book, you will have all these benefits.
Is this worth $1 million? You bet!

Small Step #13:
What’s Ahead in This Book
“Money is a guarantee that in the future we may
satisfy a new desire when it arises.”
Aristotle
By this point, we hope you are eager to find out how you can
put these Small Steps to work and achieve superior long-
term results.
Before you turn to the next section, here’s a hint of what’s
coming.
You know the value of investing in small-company stocks
(Small Step #7) and value stocks (Small Step #8). There’s
another stock type that combines the merits of these two: It’s
called small-company value, and we’ll discuss it in Chapter
16.
You’ve been introduced to the advantages of a target date
retirement fund, which we discuss further in Chapter 14.
When we get to the implementation stage, we’ll show you a
simple two-fund strategy that, over time, will let you take



==================================================
                     PAGE 81                      
==================================================

advantage of small-company value investing. (If you’re
skittish, we’ll also show you how to get much of that same
advantage while taking somewhat less risk.)
A sneak preview
Here’s a peek at one way to do that: Imagine you’re young
and you can commit to investing $1,000 a year for 40 years.
You consider two possibilities.
ONE: You could invest all your money in the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index. Based on the average 40-year return of
that index from 1928 through 2019 (11%), after 40 years,
your savings would grow to $581,826—a very nice result
from the $40,000 that you saved over the years.
TWO: Alternatively, you could take a small leap of faith into
small-company value stocks by allocating 10% of each annual
investment ($100 a year) to a small-company value fund,
putting the other 90% in the S&P 500.
Again, based on average 40-year returns since 1928 (16.2%
for small-company value stocks), that second strategy would
be worth $773,481 after 40 years. That’s about 30% more
than you would have from the S&P 500 by itself.
That difference came from doing something different with
only $100 a year, or only 10% of your portfolio.
The payoff from this Small Step is nearly five times as much
as the total of all the money that you put in over 40 years.
In Section Three of this book, we’ll look at other (and in our
opinion, even better) ways you can combine two funds to
achieve your goals—and quite possibly exceed them.

A Young Investor’s Best Friend:
The Target date Fund
“When there are multiple solutions to a problem,
choose the simplest one.”
John C. Bogle
Authors’ note: This is the longest chapter in this book. But in
some ways, it’s the most important. Paragraph for
paragraph, we don’t know anywhere you’ll get more benefit
from the time it takes you to read this.
Two Funds for Life uses a target date retirement fund, a
product that we introduced briefly in Chapter 12 and will be
the backbone of your portfolio. If you use it well, it will be
amazingly valuable to you.
In 2020, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s
Wharton School of Business concluded that 401(k) investors
who put their money in target date funds earned an average
of 2.3 percentage points more than investors who used the
other mutual funds in their retirement plans instead.



==================================================
                     PAGE 84                      
==================================================

Involving over one million participants in 880 plans that
offered Vanguard target date funds, the study covered a 12-
year period ending in 2015 that included strong market
growth as well as the severe bear market of 2007–2009.
Over 30 years, the researchers concluded that difference
could translate into 50% more retirement wealth for
participants who invest solely in target date funds than those
who invest in other funds offered in their plans.
Many people will make investments they will hold longer
than 30 years, and for them, this benefit will be larger.
Think for a moment about those 2.3 extra percentage points
of annualized return from a target date fund.
In Chapter 4, we saw that a difference of just 0.5% could add
more than $1 million to your lifetime investment results.
This study is saying a target date fund is more than four
times as powerful.
Do we have your full attention? If so, let’s dig into the details.
To understand a target date fund, you should be familiar
with two products: The mutual fund and the index fund.
The mutual fund
A mutual fund is an investment pool that treats ordinary
folks almost the same as wealthy investors. Nowadays, even
the most ignorant, uninterested, and naïve investor
(obviously we’re not saying this applies to you!) can get fair
and reasonably priced professional treatment from Wall
Street.
It wasn’t always like that.



==================================================
                     PAGE 85                      
==================================================

Before the mutual fund was invented (the first one was the
Massachusetts Investors Trust, started in 1924), the
investment world was organized primarily to benefit wealthy
individuals who had lots of resources as well as the trust
departments of banks and old-school brokerage firms that
charged fees and commissions to buy and sell individual
stocks and bonds.
Some of these banks and investment firms eventually figured
out that it would be in their interest to find an efficient way
to help the children and other family members of their
wealthy clients. The solution they found was a private
arrangement for pooling money and sharing the costs of
professional management. Thus was born the in-house
mutual fund.
Before long, Wall Street realized that money could be made
by offering this arrangement to the public, and that led to the
mutual fund as we know it today.
The advantages of mutual funds are no secret. By pooling
your money with that of many other shareholders, you can
get broad diversification (Small Step #4) and yet start with a
very small investment; in some cases, their minimum initial
investment is as low as $1.
It’s easy to buy and sell mutual fund shares. At the end of
every business day, you can sell your shares back to the
mutual fund company (or buy more) at the exact price they
are worth that day—your proportional share of all the
underlying securities and cash in the fund’s portfolio.
As a mutual fund shareholder, you get professional
management and access to stocks and other investment
products at low costs that would be difficult, if not
impossible, for most individuals to achieve.



==================================================
                     PAGE 86                      
==================================================

Most mutual funds make it easy for you to automatically
have dividends and capital gains reinvested, to make
periodic additions to your accounts, and to make automatic
withdrawals.
Because mutual funds are subject to government regulation
and have to report their key information in standard ways, it
is easy to compare them.
Is this a perfect investment vehicle? Not quite.
• Mutual funds don’t let shareholders in taxable
accounts control the timing of capital gains and
losses. Shareholders can be stuck with unexpected tax
bills as a result, although usually these bills are
modest.
• Fund managers may actively buy and sell securities,
creating taxable income for shareholders, even if the
shareholders don’t do any trading themselves.
• Worse, mutual fund expenses can be very high, often
taking away one to two percentage points of the return
that a fund’s portfolio earned for shareholders.
All these things added up to a lucrative business for
companies that managed mutual funds. But they weren’t
always optimal for fund shareholders.
The index fund
The second essential building block of a properly designed
target date fund is the index fund (we say “properly” because
we believe investors should avoid target date funds that are
built of actively managed funds instead of index funds).



==================================================
                     PAGE 87                      
==================================================

Stock indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 Index have
been around for many decades. Long ago, big institutional
investors devised low-cost ways to buy most or all the stocks
in an index, creating their own private funds. These pools
were called index funds.
John Bogle, the founder of The Vanguard Group (now one of
the largest mutual fund companies), dealt a shock to the
mutual fund industry in 1976 by offering an index fund for
sale to the public.
Suddenly, individual investors could bypass high-priced
managers and own virtually every stock within an asset class
such as the S&P 500. Fund expenses could be cut to the
bone—often by 90% or more—and taxable events could be
minimized.
This offered investors more diversification, lower costs,
lower risks, lower taxes and professional management all in
a single package.
Many mutual funds still charged sales commissions that, in
some cases, amounted to more than 9% of the money that
was actually invested.
In 1977, Vanguard dropped sales charges on all its mutual
funds, including index funds. That was a real boon to
individual investors.
As you can imagine, not everybody was happy with this new
development. For years, Wall Street tried to fight index
funds.



==================================================
                     PAGE 88                      
==================================================

But as more and more individual investors started realizing
that index funds were a low-cost ticket to better returns, Wall
Street caved, deciding to embrace the trend rather than resist
it.
Over the past 40 years, index funds have found widespread
acceptance. Costs to shareholders have dropped, in a few
cases to zero. Index funds now hold trillions of dollars in
investment assets for individuals, corporations, and other
institutions.
Although the first index funds concentrated on large-
company stocks like those in the S&P 500 Index, there are
now separate index funds for enough types of U.S. and
international stocks that ordinary investors can custom-
tailor their portfolios to their individual needs.
Not quite perfect
Although index funds almost always do a fine job of tracking
the performance of their index, they have no way to meet the
individual needs of their shareholders.
Most people saving for retirement need what we call a “glide
path”—a plan for gradually reducing their overall level of risk
as they grow older. Index funds don’t have any such glide
path, which is their biggest shortcoming for most investors.
One or more all-equity index funds might be suitable for
investors in their 20s and 30s. But by the time most
investors reach their 40s or 50s, they should also own some
bond funds to reduce their portfolio’s volatility.



==================================================
                     PAGE 89                      
==================================================

Ideally, the proportion of stocks in your portfolio should
come down gradually as you approach retirement. But index
funds don’t make any provision for that.
Of course, it’s not hard to create your own glide path by
making changes over time. For example, you can sell some
shares of an equity index fund and put the proceeds into a
fixed-income index fund.
But this requires you to make a decision and take action to
implement it. Unfortunately, the majority of investors do
those things poorly, too late, or not at all.
A new product to the rescue!
The target date retirement fund
In the late 20th century, as corporate pensions fell by the
wayside and individual investors were increasingly required
to make their own investment choices inside their 401(k) and
other retirement plans, most participants in those plans
made one initial decision—then never reviewed their
allocations over time, even as their risk tolerance evolved.
Some investors left all their money in “safe” options like
money-market funds, therefore getting very little return.
Others put all their money in equities and left it there until
they retired. Neither of those approaches was wise.
The solution began to take shape in the early 1990s when
Wells Fargo and Barclays Global Investors figured out that
they could provide a lifelong strategy that would suit most
investors. Their strategy: organize the participants in
retirement plans into groups with broadly similar needs.



==================================================
                     PAGE 90                      
==================================================

The two companies realized that the most powerful piece of
data about any given investor was the number of years
remaining before the expected start of retirement, so they
introduced the first target date fund in 1994.
(Here’s a hint of what’s ahead: That data point, i.e., the
number of years before retirement, is an important part of
Two Funds for Life.)
Most people who expected to retire in any given year would
presumably be well served by a similar glide path, which
could be provided by a specific mix of stocks and bonds.
For example, people who plan to retire within a few years of
2050 presumably have similar needs for gradually reducing
their investment risk.
Over the years within a “2050” fund, the managers can
gradually reduce the proportion of equity funds while they
gradually increase the proportion of fixed-income funds.
A “2030” fund will be managed much more conservatively
since its shareholders presumably plan to retire much
sooner. These people, less than a decade away from
retirement, presumably cannot afford to have the bulk of
their money in stocks, since a major market decline could
wipe out enough value that they could be forced to delay
their retirement.
A terrific product in many ways
For investors who want to make just one investment decision
that is likely to serve them well for the rest of their lives, a
target date fund seemed like an excellent choice.



==================================================
                     PAGE 91                      
==================================================

The public quickly agreed. Fidelity introduced its Freedom
Funds in 1996; T. Rowe Price followed in 2002, and
Vanguard in 2003.
Vanguard is now by far the largest player in this market,
managing almost 40% of all the assets in target date funds—
more than the second-, third-, and fourth-largest providers
combined.
According to Vanguard, roughly half of all 401(k) retirement
plan participants have their entire accounts in just one target
date fund as their default investment strategy.
In other words, American workers are relying very heavily on
these funds for their futures. It’s not a tremendous stretch to
say that the target date fund has taken the place once held by
the corporate pension.
Target date funds have total assets measured in trillions of
dollars. We believe they are among the greatest modern
financial inventions that benefit individual investors. For an
investment product that’s not yet 25 years old, that’s pretty
impressive.
Still not quite perfect
Still, target date funds don’t go the whole distance in taking
care of investors.
Here are four ways they fall short.
Problem #1: Large-company blend stocks often make up
about 75% of the equity component of a typical target date
fund. This means the funds fail to give investors significant
access to some long-established stock types with superior
long-term track records.



==================================================
                     PAGE 92                      
==================================================

Specifically, target date funds have only minimal exposure to
small-company stocks (Small Step #7) and value stocks
(Small Step #8). Over the years, these two types of stocks
have consistently achieved significantly higher long-term
returns than large-company blend funds that include growth
stocks and value stocks.
As a result, long-term investors in target date funds miss out
on returns that could potentially double the amount of
money they will have to spend during their retirement years.
We believe that 20-something investors can safely benefit
from having at least half their money in small-company
stocks and value stocks. Target date funds don’t give them
anything remotely close to that.
Problem #2: There’s little disagreement that young
investors can afford to take more risks than older investors,
and they have ample time to reap the likely long-term
rewards of doing so. Yet target date funds use the same mix
of stocks for all investors regardless of their age.
Target date funds provide only one type of glide path: By
gradually reducing the portfolio’s exposure to equity funds.
They could easily provide another glide path by adjusting the
mix of stocks, for example, by owning more value stocks and
small-company stocks in the early years, then transitioning
to more large-company blend stocks as retirement gets
closer.
But target date funds don’t do this.
Problem #3: Target date funds treat their shareholders as
if the only thing that matters is their age. This is effective up
to a point, and it’s certainly convenient for fund companies.



==================================================
                     PAGE 93                      
==================================================

However, by lumping everybody of a certain age into a single
pool, target date funds wind up with the appropriate mix of
assets for only some of their shareholders, not all of them.
Some people are inherently adventurous (aggressive), and
others inherently more skittish (conservative).
Fund companies could easily design three variants of each
target date fund. For example: One for investors who prefer
an aggressive approach, one for those who see themselves as
moderate, and a third for investors who regard themselves as
more conservative.
Problem #4: Target date funds saddle even their youngest
shareholders with bonds, reducing their expected annual
returns by approximately 0.5% for every 10 percentage
points of the portfolio that are not in equities.
The good news
Fortunately, Two Funds for Life provides a good solution to
each of these shortcomings.
• It tackles Problem #1 by adding a healthy dose of
small-company and value stocks.
• It tackles Problem #2 by offering a glide path that
adjusts the risk of the types of stocks as well as the
overall risk of holding equities. It tackles Problem #3
by prescribing a moderate option and then showing
how to easily modify it for investors who are more
aggressive or more conservative.
• It tackles Problem #4 by reducing (though not
eliminating entirely) the bond component of young
investors’ portfolios.
• To our great delight, and to your benefit, the strategy
outlined in this book shows how you can get all these

Risk in the Real World
“Go out on a limb. That’s where the fruit is.”
U.S. President Jimmy Carter
In Chapter 16, we’ll dig into the type of stock that, in our
opinion, has the best potential for beefing up the returns
you’re likely to achieve in your target date fund. We’ll
present our best recommendations for how you combine
Two Funds for Life.
In the real world, things don’t always turn out the way we
want or expect them to. That certainly applies to investing
money. So let’s get the topic of investment risk out on the
table right now for a short discussion.
This is a big topic, and we hope you will regard what follows
as “just a little straight talk among friends” (to borrow a
phrase from President Gerald Ford's speech when he took
the oath of office.).
Our recommendations will be most potent for young
investors, i.e., those with decades left before they expect to



==================================================
                     PAGE 96                      
==================================================

retire. If you have lots of time ahead, you should ask yourself,
What is the real risk I’m taking?
It’s no secret that there’s more statistical risk in small-
company value stocks than in the S&P 500 or the mix of
stocks that make up most target date funds.
To get on the same page, let’s differentiate between
“statistical risk” and what we call “real-world risk.”
Statisticians like to fall back on standard deviation, which
essentially measures predictability (or technically, the
magnitude of variation in a set of numbers—in this case,
investment returns over time).
A low standard deviation indicates that annual returns fall
within a narrow band from highest to lowest. A low figure
indicates the returns are quite predictable; a very high figure
indicates they could be “all over the map.”
That’s useful if predictability is the most important thing to
you. But in the real world, what scares investors is losing
money. What they want is to make money.
If that’s what you want, standard deviation is a poor guide.
Imagine an investment that year after year has annual
returns in a narrow range, say between 9.5% and 10.5%.
That’s quite predictable, with a low standard deviation that
suggests it’s not very risky.
Now imagine that every so often, the return falls into the
range of 4% to 5%. That’s much less predictable, and its
higher standard deviation would label it relatively risky. You
would probably agree.



==================================================
                     PAGE 97                      
==================================================

But now imagine that those occasional returns were 14% or
15% instead. Would this seem risky to you? The formula for
determining standard deviation makes no distinction
between favorable and unfavorable variations. If it varies by
much, it’s unpredictable, and the statistic suggests it’s risky.
In other words, the formula for standard deviation
technically regards good fortune as just as “risky” as bad
fortune.
We don’t know anyone who thinks like that. The investors we
know are happy to accept the best of times without getting
scared. That’s probably true for you, too.
That's why we put the phrase "in the real world" in the title
of this chapter.
Real-world risk
In the real world, a better way to think about risk is to
consider what could happen that’s bad, that could cost you
money. What is the worst that’s likely to happen?
If, like the majority of investors, you are no more than 55
years old, and thus you have at least a theoretical investment
horizon of at least 40 years, you should be extremely
interested in some numbers that you’ll find in Tables 15-1
and 15-2.
With the help of a crack research team, we looked at the very
best 40-year returns and the very worst 40-year returns for
four major types of U.S. stocks: The Standard & Poor's 500
Index, large-company value stocks, small-company stocks (a
blend of growth and value), and small-company value stocks.



==================================================
                     PAGE 98                      
==================================================

To get right to the point, Table 15-1 shows that the worst 40-
year period for each of three diversifying types of stock was
better than the best 40-year period for the S&P 500.
For long-term investors, those numbers certainly show the
benefit of diversifying beyond the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.
Now let’s translate the numbers into dollars, assuming a
one-time investment of $100.
Table 15-2 is identical to the previous one except that dollars
are substituted for compound rates of return.



==================================================
                     PAGE 99                      
==================================================

In other words, among these four types of stocks, no matter
what you did for any 40-year period from 1970 through
2019, you could not lose by diversifying beyond the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.
And that’s essentially what we’re suggesting in Two Funds
for Life.
If your idea of risk is the probability of losing money, we
hope you will remember this: In every 40-year period from
1970 through 2018, compared with the S&P 500, small-
company value stocks gave investors much more of what
they wanted (return) along with less of what they didn’t want
(risk).
If you want a reasonable shot at really superior performance,
and if you’ve got faith and patience over a long time horizon,
we believe your best choice is small-company value stocks.
In Chapter 16, we’ll tell you more.

The Magic of Small-Company
Value Stocks
“There is magic, but you have to be the magician. You
have to make the magic happen.”
Sidney Sheldon, novelist/writer/director/producer
Earlier in the book, we introduced small-company value
stocks. These stocks effectively act like a turbo booster in the
Two Funds for Life strategy.
As we saw, investing in small-company stocks has been very
productive in the past. Smaller companies have lots of room
to become big, and some of them grow exponentially. When
you own them by the hundreds or thousands through a
mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund, you’ll be sure to
own those relatively few small companies that are destined
to become giants. That’s where you’re likely to make good
money.
As we also saw, value stocks (those selling at “bargain” prices
for various reasons) are good long-term investments when
you own them by the hundreds or thousands. They have a
long history of outperforming growth stocks, whether you’re



==================================================
                     PAGE 101                     
==================================================

talking about small stocks or large ones, U.S. stocks, or
international stocks. The value phenomenon holds up among
emerging-markets stocks, too.
We’ve seen that small works. We’ve seen that value works.
It makes good sense to invest in both of these, and it makes
terrific sense to combine the two by investing in small-
company value stocks.
This is truly a 2-in-1 package deal: One asset class that
combines the benefits of small size along with the bargain
prices of value stocks. Over the past 92 years, small-company
value has been a great addition to any equity portfolio.
It might seem like small-company value investing is doubly
risky, and in some ways, it is. But in the long run, it has been
amply rewarding, too. In Chapter 15, when we described the
best and worst 40-year periods, we saw that for long-term
investors, the risks of small-company value investing have
been worthwhile.
Over the long haul, among the four major types of U.S.
stocks (large-company blend, like the S&P 500, large-
company value, small-company blend, and small-company
value), the undisputed champion is small-company value.
Let’s look at some numbers.
One easy-to-understand way to measure “real-world risk” is
to look at whether an investment was profitable or
unprofitable in any particular calendar year.
From 1928 through 2019, small-company value stocks had
63 profitable calendar years, roughly two of every three. But
that’s only part of the story. In 45 of those years, the small-



==================================================
                     PAGE 102                     
==================================================

company value index was up more than 20%; and in 19
years, the gains were more than 40%.
Of course, there were negative years, roughly one of every
three.
But if that statistic worries you, consider the following: On
average, the positive years were twice as good as the negative
years were bad. That means you got twice as many good
years as bad ones, and on average the good years were very
good.
In the last chapter, we explored returns in 40-year periods
from 1970 through 2019.
Here, we want to take a longer view and look at 40-year
returns from 1928 through 2019. That gives us a much bigger
sample—52 such periods, in fact.
The very worst 40-year period began in 1928 and went
through 1967. Small-company value stocks returned 11.6%,
well above the 9.9% long-term return of the “safe” Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.
Maybe 40 years is longer than you want to think about. OK,
that’s fair, so let’s try 15 years. The very worst 15-year period
for small-company value stocks started in 1928 and ended
with a compound loss of 1.9%. The very best 15-year period
began in 1975 and wound up with a compound gain of
26.3%.
On average, those 15-year periods brought gains of 16.2% to
small-company value investors. Only seven of those periods
resulted in compound returns below 10%.



==================================================
                     PAGE 103                     
==================================================

There’s no guarantee, of course, but we don’t see any reason
to doubt that small-company value stocks will continue to
produce better long-term returns than the S&P 500.
One simple measure of the reward for taking risks is the
compound rate of return. From 1928 through 2019, the S&P
500 compounded at 9.9%, while small-company value stocks
compounded at 13.2%. That difference (13.2% vs. 9.9%) may
not seem like much in just one year. But over a decade or
several decades, it makes an enormous difference.
How enormous?
• Over 40 years, an investment growing at 9.9% (the
S&P 500) would turn $1,000 into about $43,600.
• In that same period, a $1,000 investment growing at
13.2% (small-company value stocks) would turn
$1,000 into about $142,500.
Although those numbers are impressive, they are the result
of hindsight. We know how things turned out. But investors
in real-time did not know that, and to achieve those rewards,
they had to “stick with the plan” through thick and thin.
In real life, people look at their investments and evaluate
their progress much more often than once every 40 years or
so. There have been significantly long periods (and there will
be more in the future) when large-company stocks did better
than small-company stocks. Likewise, there were (and will
be) periods when growth stocks do better than value stocks.
Risk, as it is actually experienced by investors, is subjective.
When the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index are going up, and your



==================================================
                     PAGE 104                     
==================================================

small-company-value fund is lagging behind, you may feel
anxiety.
If you supplement your target date fund with small-company
value stocks, you should expect that your two funds will
often behave differently—maybe most of the time.
Sometimes that difference will make you feel very smart or
very lucky. Other times, that difference will make you feel
unlucky or not so smart.
In Two Funds for Life, you look to small-company value
funds for higher long-term returns. But you look to your
target date fund for psychological solace. You’ll perhaps get
that solace in the comfortable knowledge that this important
part of your portfolio is behaving “normally”—in other
words, similarly to what you’re likely hearing on the news.
If you can keep the faith, you’ll benefit from the best of both
worlds.

Two Funds for Life Before
Retirement
“Pearls don’t lie on the seashore.
If you want one, you must dive for it.”
Chinese proverb
This chapter contains the specifics of our Two Funds for Life
advice.
There’s good news and bad news here. The bad news applies
to us as authors; the good news applies to you.
The bad news: It’s impossible to prescribe a lifetime of
precisely suitable asset allocations for investors we don’t
know. And even if we know your current situation, we can’t
know the future, either the future of the markets or what
steps you will take as an investor.
Therefore, we can’t guarantee your results.
The good news: If your asset allocation is in the ballpark, you
will have a high probability of long-term investing success.



==================================================
                     PAGE 107                     
==================================================

The simplest way to use this strategy
If you’re looking for a one-decision way to get the benefits of
a target date fund and small-company value stocks, without
ever making any changes, here it is.
Allocate 90% of your current 401(k) balance, plus all future
contributions, to your target date fund. Allocate the other
10% to a small-company value fund. Keep that allocation
forever.
It can’t get much simpler than that.
In every 40-year period from 1970 to 2019, this strategy
produced a higher return than that of the target date fund
alone. The results varied a lot depending on the starting
point, but the average improvement over 40 years was 23%.
(If you want to ramp things up a notch, you could opt for
20% in small-company value instead of 10%. In those same
40-year periods, the average improvement was 45%.)
There’s a downside to this. As you get older, your small-
company value fund is likely to make up an increasingly
large percentage of your portfolio, subjecting you to more
and more risk. That’s the opposite of the conventional
wisdom that you should take less risk, not more, as you get
older.
Fortunately, we can suggest a good way around that.
Our basic advice
Nevertheless, our core advice is designed to remove that
outsize risk in your retirement years. And it’s almost as easy
to implement.



==================================================
                     PAGE 108                     
==================================================

The basic Two Funds for Life recommendation for your
401(k) plan is pretty simple:
• Multiply your age by 1.5.
• Use the result as the percentage of your portfolio that
should be in a target date retirement fund. The rest
goes into a small-company value fund.
• As you get older, rebalance these two funds
periodically, ideally once a year, based on your age at
the time. This will gradually reduce your small-
company value exposure.
For example, if you are 30, multiply your age by 1.5 to get 45.
That means 45% of your portfolio belongs in your target date
fund; the other 55% goes into small-company value.
By that formula, when you’re 40, you’ll have 60% in the
target date fund and 40% in small-company value. When
you’re 50, you’ll have 75% in the target date fund and 25% in
small-company value.
This approach is aggressive when you’re young, and it
becomes gradually less adventurous as you get older.
You may be wondering how much this will improve your
portfolio results. We wanted to know that too, so we did
some digging.
Using detailed data going back to 1970, we wanted to know
how a target date fund all by itself would have fared in an
average holding period of 40 years.
Because target date funds didn’t exist until the 1990s, our
research team built a model that used a glide path and asset
allocations similar to those of Vanguard’s target date funds.



==================================================
                     PAGE 109                     
==================================================

We assumed an investor started with $1,000 and added
another $1,000 (adjusted for actual inflation) for each of the
next 39 years. We sliced and diced the data to compute the
returns for hundreds of 40-year periods from 1970 through
2019 (we got hundreds of periods by simulating a different
starting date at the beginning of every month).
The result: With all the money going into a target date fund,
after 40 years, the average portfolio balance was $698,800.
Next, we asked what the average ending portfolio value
would have been for an investor who followed our Two
Funds for Life recommendations using a small-company
value fund along with a target date fund.
The result: After the same 40 years of investments, that Two
Funds for Life average portfolio value was $972,900.
The difference: $274,100, an increase of 39%.
Of course, we know that adding small-company value to a
target date fund adds risk as well, so we asked our research
team to measure the risk of these two investment plans
during this hypothetically average 40-year period.
Specifically, we wanted to know the worst-ever drawdown in
each case. (A drawdown is the percentage loss from a
portfolio high to a subsequent low. For example, if the
portfolio value peaked at $100,000 and then went down
until it bottomed out at $80,000 before heading back up, the
drawdown would be $20,000, or 20%.)
You might be surprised to learn that adding a small-
company value fund to the target date fund did not increase
that risk by much. That’s shown in Table 17-1.



==================================================
                     PAGE 110                     
==================================================

A less-risky alternative
We’ve designed this strategy to gradually reduce risk as your
birthdays pile up.
But if you prefer a more conservative approach, it’s easy:
Substitute a large-company value fund for the small-
company value fund. If you do that, you can expect lower
volatility. And though you will forego the expected returns of
small-company value stocks, you’ll still get the impressive
results of investing in value stocks (Small Step #8).



==================================================
                     PAGE 111                     
==================================================

Getting it just right
Unfortunately, it’s impossible to know in advance the exact
formula for achieving the highest returns. Your results will
be unpredictable and out of your control.
Despite the best efforts of the smartest investors, the luck of
timing plays a huge part in what happens. Here’s an
example, something we have both experienced in our lives as
investors.
From 1975 through 1999, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index
had a compound return of 17%. Small-company value stocks
returned more than 22%.
But investors who might understandably have considered
those returns “the new normal” were in for a rude
awakening. From 2000 through 2019, the S&P 500’s return
was about 6%; small-company value stocks returned about
10%.
We began this book by urging investors to do two things:
Save money and start saving earlier. Here's a third
recommendation: Save more.
We know that’s not possible for everyone, but in the face of
such uncertainty, it’s a good way to “hope for the best and
plan for the worst.”

Putting the Numbers to Work:
Rebalancing
“The beauty of periodic rebalancing is that it forces
you to base your investing decisions on a simple,
objective standard.”
Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor
Rebalancing is the periodic chore of bringing your
allocations back to their starting percentages.
For example, if your Two Funds for Life portfolio should be
divided 50/50 between the two funds, and the small-
company value part of it has grown to 55%, you can restore
the prescribed percentages by selling some of the small-
company value stocks and investing the proceeds in your
target date fund.
How often should you rebalance?
The Two Funds for Life formula outlined in the previous
chapter calls for rebalancing every year based on your age
and expected retirement year. Once a year is standard



==================================================
                     PAGE 113                     
==================================================

practice: a long enough interval to give the higher-
performing asset a chance to do its thing, but short enough
to keep your risk level in check.
The choice of rebalancing frequency lets you fine-tune your
level of risk. To choose less risk, rebalance more often. To
allow more risk in hopes of achieving higher long-term
returns, rebalance less often.
Step-by-step
Rebalancing between just two funds is relatively easy. If you
need step-by-step directions, here they are with a simple
example.
Step 1: Determine your target allocation. Let’s say your
portfolio is worth $100,000, and your goal is to have 60% in
your target date fund and 40% in your small-company value
fund. That means your target date fund should have
$60,000.
Step 2: Determine your actual allocation. Let’s say your
small-company value fund has grown so much that it’s worth
$48,000 (leaving your target date fund with only $52,000).
Step 3: Compute the difference between target and actual,
in this case, $8,000. Sell that much of the fund that’s gotten
too big and reinvest that amount in the one that’s too small.
Our recommendations assume your two funds are in a
401(k) or an IRA, in which case you’ll not incur any tax
consequences for selling some of your holdings in a fund and
moving the proceeds to another.
If you’re doing this in a taxable account, every sale of an
appreciated asset may trigger a taxable gain. In this type of
account, you’ll keep more of your money working for you if
you avoid selling anything. Especially in the early years,



==================================================
                     PAGE 114                     
==================================================

when your balances are smaller in relation to your regular
contributions, you can reduce or eliminate the tax
consequences if you leave the balances alone and allocate
your contributions to the fund that’s below its target.
However you do it, rebalancing will keep your portfolio on
track. It’s something you’ll probably need to do even after
you retire.

Two Funds After Retirement
“Not everything that can be counted counts,
and not everything that counts can be counted.”
Albert Einstein
If you use the Two Funds for Life strategy to save enough
money to retire, you have our hefty congratulations.
You may already know enough to figure out your investment
needs from here on.
However, you most likely have a lot of years ahead of you as
an investor. Some decisions you make now will affect you for
the rest of your life, and they could affect your heirs as well.
In Chapter 20, we suggest some possible paths from which
you can choose.
Before we get there, we have a little important homework for
you, as well as a few questions for you to think about.
The most important piece of this homework should be done
long before you actually retire. The job is to figure out
whether, when you retire, you have (or will have) “just barely



==================================================
                     PAGE 116                     
==================================================

enough” to support your needs or ample resources to live as
you choose.
Richard Buck: There’s a middle ground that I sometimes
describe as “We have enough to do what we want as long
we don’t do something stupid.”
Calculating distributions (money you take out of your
portfolio) is a vital part of retirement planning. It’s beyond
the scope of this book, but we’ll take this opportunity to hit a
few high points.
What do you need?
If you’ve done a good job managing your investments, you’re
probably no slouch about the rest of your finances. You
probably have a good idea in general of the regular expenses
you can expect to continue.
Some expenses (commuting and buying work clothes, for
example) will end. Some new expenses will arise, especially if
your retirement dreams call for major travel or building a
cabin at the lake.
Step One: Start by calculating the income you will need to
maintain the lifestyle you desire in retirement.
You’ll probably start with a mix of monthly, annual, or
semiannual expenses like property taxes and variable
expenses such as travel, gifts, and recreation.
When you’ve got these down, calculate this into an annual
total.



==================================================
                     PAGE 117                     
==================================================

What will you have?
Step Two: Calculate whatever regular income you’ll have
from sources like Social Security, rental real estate, pensions,
annuities, or interest on loans you might have made. Don’t
include capital gains or other investment income here (we’ll
get to that shortly).
Once you compute this annual non-investment income, you
can easily compare it to your annual needs.
If the income you can count on is equal to or greater than
your needs, you’re in fabulous shape. More likely, however,
you will need to draw from your portfolio to fully meet your
needs. Think of the difference as a “gap.”
Step Three: Calculate this annual gap as a percentage of
your total investment portfolio, which may include
investments in addition to your target date fund.
If, for example, your investments total $1 million and you
need $40,000 from them per year to meet your needs, that
gap is equal to 4% of your portfolio.
Closing the gap
If you can close the gap and meet your needs by taking out
4% or less, then you’re probably in good shape.
If you need to take out more than 4% of your portfolio each
year to meet your needs, you should consider re-thinking
your retirement plans. (This is why this step is particularly
valuable when you have ample time before retirement.)
If you come up short, here are three options to consider:
• Postpone your retirement while you keep working and
saving.



==================================================
                     PAGE 118                     
==================================================

• Reduce your expectations for how much you’ll spend.
• Plan to take on some part-time work during
retirement, if possible.
You might find the best solution is a combination of two of
those options—or even all three.
In any case, there’s your homework.
Things to think about
In addition, we think every new or soon-to-be retiree should
spend some time thinking about a few basic questions:
• How important is it to leave money for kids,
grandchildren, or charitable causes? Do you want to
make sure there’s likely to be money left in your estate
for that?
• To meet your goals, are you willing to add one or even
two additional funds to your target date fund?
• If you’re hoping to leave money to your heirs, are you
comfortable segregating that money and taking a bit
more risk with it to potentially have a larger estate?
These questions will help you choose the path that’s likely to
do the best job of meeting your needs.
(What we have outlined here is a quick overview of a very
important process that’s described in Chapter 10 of our book
Financial Fitness Forever. The chapter is called “Twelve
Numbers to Change Your Life,” and it’s available free online
at paulmerriman.com. To find it, search “twelve numbers to
change your life.”)
Next, we’ll explore some of the possible paths that your
answers might suggest.

Two Funds During Retirement
“The goal of retirement is to
live off your assets—not on them.”
Frank Eberhart- author of The Sexy Little Book of Finance III
In the best possible scenario, your investments over a
lifetime will have been so successful that your target date
fund will be worth more than enough to meet all your needs,
and then some.
In this lovely case, your path could be ultra-simple: keep
your money in the target date fund and withdraw whatever
you need to live the life you want without worrying about
what’s going on in the market.
Six possible paths
But if you’re not quite that fortunate, we have identified six
possible paths you can follow, depending on your
circumstances. You can mix and match them if you like,
although we suspect that by now you enjoy the simplicity of
owning just two funds. So don’t let your creativity run away
with you!



==================================================
                     PAGE 120                     
==================================================

(This might be a good time to remind you of our advice in
Chapter 11 regarding the need to pay attention to taxes.
Before you embark on any of the suggested paths in this
chapter, make sure you won’t be inadvertently incurring
large taxable capital gains.)
Path One: If you have “enough”
If your portfolio can support 4% annual withdrawals, the
conservatively allocated portfolio in your target date fund
might be all you need.
It could be tempting to keep some of your money in a small-
company value fund to potentially earn a higher return. But
at this stage of your life, hanging on to what you have can be
more important than potentially earning more.
Your best course could be to pare down your portfolio from
two funds to just one. This will make your financial life
simple and worry-free.
Path Two: If you have “more than enough”
and want a dependable income.
Paul Merriman: When I talk to groups of retirees, I like to
ask for a show of hands. How many people here have a
pension? How many of you with your hands up get peace of
mind from that pension? Usually, all the hands stay up.
Most young people these days aren’t likely to retire with
corporate pensions. They may have Social Security, but the
long-term future of that program is less than certain.
If your resources are ample, you can “buy” a pension in the
form of an insurance contract called a single-premium life
annuity. In return for an up-front payment based on your
age and gender, the insurance company agrees to pay you
monthly for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live.

==================================================

Here’s a simple Two Funds for Life strategy: “Buy a pension”
that’s large enough to meet your basic cash flow needs, then
invest the remainder of your nest egg in another fund.
That could be your target date fund. Or it could be something
with a bit more equity exposure that’s likely to provide a
higher long-term return.
Knowing that your basic needs are met by your annuity, you
might be comfortable taking a bit more risk with the
remainder of your portfolio.
Vanguard offers a group of “LifeStrategy” funds with lots of
diversification and four choices of risk level. Their annual
expenses are very reasonable (Chapter Five), at just 0.13%.
These funds let you choose to have equities make up 20%,
40%, 60%, or 80% of your assets.
If you go that route, we’d suggest you first consider either
40% or 60% in equities, as those moderate allocations are
not likely to get you in a lot of trouble.
Paul Merriman: My wife and I have a 50/50 stock/bond
mix in our retirement investments. You could easily
accomplish that by making equal investments in the 40%
LifeStrategy fund and its 60% counterpart.
The proper allocation is entirely up to you and your comfort
level.
Path Three: If you want to make sure to take
care of people or charities after you’re gone.
If this is you, we suggest you set aside enough in your target
date fund to amply support your own lifestyle in retirement,
then choose another fund (or even more than one) with a
level of risk that’s appropriate for your heirs and intended
beneficiaries.



==================================================
                     PAGE 122                     
==================================================

Tossing out a number at random, imagine you have
$200,000 that you doubt you will need in your lifetime, and
you want to leave it to your daughter.
If you do nothing, “her” $200,000 inheritance could be tied
up in a target date fund that by now is mostly invested in
bonds (good for you, but not optimal for an investment that
your daughter may not receive for 20 or more years).
You’ll probably want to retain ownership of this money, of
course, so you can tap into it in case you need to.
But there’s no reason you can’t invest that $200,000 in a
way that will give her the potential for the growth you
experienced from a small-company value fund.
How? We think you could do a lot worse than investing that
$200,000 along the lines of Two Funds for Life, with the
allocation based on her age.
If you have multiple heirs, you can set up accounts for each
one. Or you could invest in a single fund, identify it in your
will and specify how the proceeds should be divided.
Whatever you do along these lines for children or
grandchildren, we suggest you give them each a copy of this
book so they understand your intentions.
Path Four: If you want to keep getting the
benefit of small-company value stocks.
If you’ve benefitted from the addition of a small-company
value fund and, as a result, are in good shape financially, you
are probably glad you took on the additional risk.



==================================================
                     PAGE 123                     
==================================================

If you are quite comfortable keeping some of your money
invested in small-company value stocks, then a 10% stake
could add more than 0.5% a year to your long-term return.
It’s entirely possible that over a 25- to 30-year retirement,
that difference could give a 20% to 30% boost to the total of
your retirement distributions plus what you leave behind for
your heirs.
Path Five: If you are in your mid-70’s and
ready to accept more risk than you’ll find in
the bond-centric portfolio of your target date
fund.
By the time you retire, a majority of your target date fund
will be invested in bonds. In this case, you might be
comfortable taking more risk.
You could then part ways with that fund and try something
new. This may seem like heresy, but it has some merit.
This path is built on a combination of two large, tried-and-
true mutual funds: Vanguard Wellington and Vanguard
Wellesley.
Vanguard is the largest mutual fund company; it takes a
generally conservative investment approach, and its fund
expenses are among the lowest.
To evaluate this path, recall the returns from 2008, an awful
year for many investors.
It was a year when the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost
37%, and many investors lost more. Wellington and
Wellesley weren’t exempt from pain, of course.



==================================================
                     PAGE 124                     
==================================================

But Wellington, which normally holds 40% of its portfolio in
bonds, lost only 22.2%; Wellesley, which typically holds 60%
of its portfolio in bonds, lost only 9.8%.
These two funds’ longer-term results are favorable.
• Since its inception in 1929, Wellington has
compounded at 8.1%. Through 2019, it had 71 up
years, 19 down ones.
• Since its inception in 1970, Wellesley has
compounded at 9.5%. Through 2019, it had 42 up
years and seven down years.
As we write this, the most recent 10-year returns are 10% for
Wellington and 7.9% for Wellesley.
If your portfolio is ample for your needs, you can consider
investing in either of these funds. One approach that many
investors seem to like is a 50-50 combination of Wellesley
and Wellington.
That would allocate your portfolio about equally between
stocks and bonds—a combination we think is suitable for
many retirees, especially those who have more than enough
to cover their basic cost of living.
Path Six: If you’re comfortable that you’re
set, you can turn back the clock and invest as
if you were younger.
Let’s say the year is 2050 and you’ve just retired comfortably
with your money safely invested in a 2050 target date fund.
The majority of that fund is invested in bonds.
You’re confident that you have enough resources, and you’d
like to take a bit more risk than your fund offers. You like the



==================================================
                     PAGE 125                     
==================================================

idea of a target date fund, and you want to stick to just one
fund.
Guess what: You can pretend you’re young again and
transfer some or all of your money to a target date fund
designed for younger investors. In this example, if you fully
expect to live at least 20 more years, there’s nothing to say
you can’t move your portfolio into a fund with a target date
20 years in the future.
That will repeat the glide path that presumably served you
well for the past 20 years, and your investments will
gradually become more conservative without any further
action required on your part.
This could easily add 0.5% to your long-term return while
keeping your level of risk under control.
Because there are multiple target date funds available, you
can essentially dial in your preferred level of risk by choosing
a fund with a target date as near—or far—into the future as
you like.
Whichever path you choose, if you have successfully achieved
financial independence, you have lots of choices open to you.
And when you’re retired, it doesn’t get much better than that.

If Your 401(k) Lacks a
Small-Company Value Option
“The most difficult thing is the decision to act.
The rest is merely tenacity."
Amelia Earhart
Not all retirement plans include a U.S. small-company value
fund.
But virtually every one offers either a small-company blend
fund (often just called “small-company”) or a large-company
value fund (sometimes just called “value”).
The solution here is pretty straightforward: Pick a small-
company fund or a value fund and follow the Two Funds for
Life strategy from Chapter 17 as if you were using a small-
company value fund.
Your returns will likely be a bit lower, but your risk level
probably will be a bit lower as well (see below).
If you’re in this situation, you may want to reread Chapters 7
and 8.



==================================================
                     PAGE 128                     
==================================================

To refresh your memory regarding small-company stocks, as
we wrote in Chapter 7, over all the 40-year periods from
1928 through 2019, small-company stocks returned an
average of 13.8%. The very best 40-year period produced a
return of 16.7%, the worst, 10.7%.
The S&P 500’s average 40-year return was 11%—just barely
above the worst 40 years for small-company stocks.
To refresh your memory regarding value stocks, in Chapter 8
we reported that over the past 92 years, value stocks had
three times as many profitable calendar years as losing years.
And the average 40-year return of large-company value
stocks was 13.5%, compared with 11% for the S&P 500.
Each type of stock—large-company value stocks and small-
company stocks—gave investors markedly better results than
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
Assuming that you have a long-term investment outlook,
here’s a repeat of an interesting table from Chapter 15 that
compares the worst periods of three types of stocks to the
best period of the S&P 500.



==================================================
                     PAGE 129                     
==================================================

The chief takeaway is that in any 40-year period during those
50 years, investors were certain to do better in any of these
three (large-company value, small-company blend, small-
company value) than if they held their money in the S&P
500.
Which of these should you choose? Frankly, you’re not likely
to go wrong with any of them.
One possible way to decide: Compare the expense ratios of
your plan’s large-company value fund and its small-company
fund, then choose whichever has lower expenses.
Also, consider the following:
In Chapter 17, we described our research showing how a Two
Funds for Life strategy might have fared from 1970 through
2019.
Our hypothetical analysis based on hundreds of tested
combinations of actual returns showed that the addition of a
small-company value fund would have boosted the average
40-year return by 39% while increasing risk by only 11%
Based on the same assumptions we used there, here’s a
similar table showing the results if either a large-company
value fund or a small-company blend fund were substituted
for a small-company value fund.



==================================================
                     PAGE 130                     
==================================================

Table 21-2: Target date fund alone vs. Two Funds for Life
formula using small-company blend or large-company
value, 1970–2019
The bottom line: in this simulation, applying the Two Funds
for Life formula with a small-company blend fund increased
the average return by 20.4% (compared with a target date
fund alone) while making almost no change in the level of
risk, measured by the worst drawdown.
Alternatively, using a large-company value fund boosted the
average return by 23.6% while increasing the worst
drawdown by 13%.
Here’s our conclusion: Even if you don’t have access to a
small-company value fund, you can still expect very good
results from using either a small-company blend fund or a
large-company value fund.
Which one will do better? There’s no way to know in
advance. But just like the choice between two flavors of ice
cream, you’re likely to be happy either way.

If you don’t have a 401(k)
or similar plan
“The grim irony of investing is that we investors as
a group not only don't get what we pay for, we get
precisely what we don’t pay for.”
John C. Bogle
Not every investor has access to a 401(k) or similar plan. But
if you have taxable income from wages or salary or business
income, you can put money into an IRA.
(You can also invest in an IRA if you want to add more to
your savings after you have reached the maximum
contribution into your 401(k)).
The annual IRA contribution limits (in 2020: $6,000 for
people under 50 years old and $7,000 for those 50 and
older) are not as high as those in employer retirement plans.
But if you sock away $6,000 a year for several decades and
invest it well, you can build a sizable retirement nest egg. To
loop back to an example from Chapter 1, if you do that
starting when you’re 30 and your investments grow at 8% a



==================================================
                     PAGE 132                     
==================================================

year, you will have a little more than $1 million by the time
you’re 65.
When you have an IRA, you can pick and choose virtually
any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund.
To open an IRA, you’ll need a brokerage account. Either
Vanguard or Fidelity would be a good choice for the
custodian. They both have a good selection of commission-
free exchange-traded funds and index-based target date
funds. Be careful to choose a target date fund that is based
on index funds instead of actively managed funds.
Once you have found a target date fund with a year that
matches your retirement plans, choose an exchange-traded
fund to boost its performance in accordance with our Two
Funds for Life recommendations.
Your best exchange-traded fund choice for small-company
value at either Vanguard or Fidelity is SPDR S&P Small Cap
Value (SLYV). Those letters, in this case, SLYV, make up
what’s called a “ticker symbol.” They represent a specific
stock or exchange-traded fund for trading on a stock
exchange.
For a large-company value exchange-traded fund, we
recommend Invesco S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV); for a small-
company blend exchange-traded fund, go with iShares Core
S&P Small-Cap (IJR).
A full list of recommended “best in class” mutual funds and
exchange-traded fund, updated every two years, is available
online at paulmerriman.com.

==================================================

Roth or traditional?
As noted in Chapter 11, IRAs come in two flavors. You have
to choose one or the other when you open your account. The
difference is all about taxes.
Whether you have a Roth or traditional IRA, there are no
taxes due on your investment income as it grows inside the
account. In each case, you will pay a penalty for withdrawing
money before you reach age 59½ unless you meet certain
requirements.
The following is not tax advice, just a quick-and-dirty
overview.
Traditional
In a traditional IRA, your contribution is tax-deductible in
the year that you make it. This makes that contribution more
affordable. However, later, when you withdraw from your
IRA, everything you take out will be taxable income.
If you need the tax deduction in order to save, this may be
the right option. The same is true if you are in a high tax
bracket and believe you’ll be in a lower bracket after you
retire (although predicting future income tax rates is
impossible).
When you reach age 72, you must begin withdrawing money
from your IRA and paying taxes on the withdrawals. These
“required minimum distributions” are determined by a
formula that’s known to all mutual fund companies and
brokerages.
Roth
In a Roth IRA, there’s no tax deduction for your
contribution. That’s the bad news.



==================================================
                     PAGE 134                     
==================================================

The good news comes when you take money out of the IRA
in retirement: You won’t owe taxes on any of it.
If you’re trying to maximize your tax-sheltered savings, the
Roth is the better choice. The Roth is also likely to give you
more peace of mind when you retire, since you’ll have tax-
free withdrawals and no required distributions. If it suits
your needs, you can leave the money in the account to grow
tax-free.
Before you open any IRA account, either traditional IRA or
Roth, make sure you are eligible, since the IRS limits the
contributions and deductions for some high-income
individuals.
Both types of IRA have other wrinkles that might or might
not affect you. So before you open an account, consult with a
tax advisor!
Something else you can do in an IRA
As mentioned above, an IRA gives you seemingly unlimited
choices of funds and exchange-traded funds.
If you’re interested, you can take advantage of this to save
some money (and thus boost your return) by creating a “do-
it-yourself” target date fund.
All that’s necessary to replicate the equity investments in a
typical target date fund is to invest 70% in a total U.S.
market index fund and the rest in a total international
market index fund. Fidelity offers those two funds with
expense ratios of zero. That’s right, zero.
Until you’re 40 years old, your money should be mostly (if
not entirely) in equities.



==================================================
                     PAGE 135                     
==================================================

Therefore, until you reach 40, those two Fidelity funds could
substitute for the target date component of your Two Funds
for Life strategy. The funds: Fidelity ZERO Total Market
Index Fund (FZROX) and Fidelity ZERO International Index
Fund (FZILX).
To complement a target date fund, you’ll still want to include
a small-company value fund or exchange-traded fund to seek
higher returns, and you’ll pay expenses for that fund no
matter how you handle the target date fund.
However, the benefits of this DIY alternative might be more
than they appear at first.
The two Fidelity ZERO funds (available when Fidelity is your
IRA custodian) cost nothing. A “index-based” target date
fund is likely to charge around 0.15%. In addition, the
unnecessary bonds in that fund will put a drag on your
performance that will further reduce your return when
compared with the two Fidelity funds.
How many actual dollars you’ll save with this plan is hard to
project, since it depends on the size of your account and your
age (which determines the mix between the zero-expense
Fidelity funds and your small-company value fund). Fidelity,
by the way, has a very inexpensive small-company value fund
with the ticker symbol FISVX.
However, every dollar you save in expenses is a dollar that
belongs to you instead of Wall Street. And it’s a dollar that
can keep growing for you.

If You Don’t Need a
Glide Path
“Save your money and someday
your money will save you.”
Anonymous
What we’re about to describe is indeed an unusual case, but
we know someone who did this to put the lessons of Two
Funds for Life to work.
He is responsible for investing some money for his family.
The investment principal will not ever be needed. Instead, at
the start of every year, the family withdraws 5% of the
balance. The rest will be left to grow.
Each year, a designated group of family members will decide
how to best use the 5% withdrawal to enhance the family’s
quality of life that year.
The investment goal is to have the principal grow over time
despite these 5% annual withdrawals.



==================================================
                     PAGE 137                     
==================================================

Our friend set this up with just two funds. The first is a
relatively conservative base fund to provide reliable long-
term growth with only moderate risk.
Since no “glide path” is needed for this portfolio, he chose
Vanguard Wellington instead of a target date fund. Initially,
70% of the portfolio went into that fund, with the remaining
30% in a small-company value exchange-traded fund.
As mentioned in Chapter 20, Vanguard Wellington normally
invests 60% of its assets in equities and 40% in bonds. This
means this family portfolio started with 72% of its
investments in equities, and 28% in bonds.
Our friend is comfortable with that allocation. The family’s
investment policy anticipates that over time, the small-
company value fund will gradually make up a larger and
larger portion of the whole portfolio.
Here’s an interesting wrinkle: The two funds will not be
rebalanced until and unless the small-company value fund
grows so much that it makes up at least 50% of the total.
At that point, 80% of the portfolio would be invested in
equities.
The funds would then be rebalanced, and the overall
allocation would once again be 72% in equities.
Letting a small-company value fund grow and grow may
seem pretty risky, but under this plan, the portfolio will
always hold at least 20% in bonds.
This is a creative way to use a small-company value fund plus
only one other fund for long-term growth.



==================================================
                     PAGE 138                     
==================================================

Our friend could have specified an even higher starting
percentage for small-company value (40% or even 50%) and
let it grow to a higher limit (75% or 80%, for example).
He set it up the way he did in order to have the majority of
the portfolio invested conservatively, in the Vanguard
Wellington fund, and truly use small-company value only as
a booster.
This whole arrangement is unusual, obviously, but it’s an
interesting variation on Two Funds for Life.

For Generous Parents or
Grandparents:
Investing for a Young Child
“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the
world. He who understands it, earns it;
he who doesn’t, pays it.”
Attributed to Albert Einstein
(without evidence he actually said it)
If you’re setting aside money for a young child, Two Funds
for Life can work well with a few modifications.
The money for such a gift won’t grow on a tree, but if you’re a
far-sighted and generous parent or grandparent, it could be
easier than you think to give a young person a big head start.
This is especially true if you recall our advice in Chapter 2:
Save earlier.
Consider this possibility: Sometime in a child’s first year of
life (ideally on the day they are born), you set aside $365.
That’s right, just $365, or $1 per day for that first year. Then
keep up that savings rate every year until the child is old
enough to take over this $1-a-day savings rate.



==================================================
                     PAGE 140                     
==================================================

If you (and later the child) do this for 20 or 25 years, then
this fortunate young adult will have a huge head start. The
math is simple: 20 years of $1 a day comes to $7,300; add
five more years, and there’s $9,125. Invested at even a
modest annualized rate of 10%, and the numbers are
considerably larger: $20,912 after 20 years, $35,907 after 25.
From the start, this money should be invested in equities.
We don’t believe young investors are served well by investing
in bonds before they are about 40, presumably 25 years from
retirement.
However, many target date funds start with about 10% of
their portfolios invested in bonds, even for the youngest
investors. (The percentage of cash and bonds in Vanguard’s
2065 fund in 2019, with 46 years to go, was 11%.)
As we saw in Chapter 13, a change in as little as 10% of a
portfolio can make a huge long-term difference, and we see
no reason that bonds should occupy even a little slice of a
young person’s portfolio.
Therefore, we think a Two Funds for Life investment for a
young child should be an all-equity portfolio. The tricky
question is how much of this young child’s portfolio goes into
a small-company value fund.
Though we believe strongly in small-company value, we
think every investor needs at least some diversification. One
good way to do that with two funds is to divide the portfolio
equally between a small-company value fund and a large-
company value fund.
This all-equity, all-value portfolio could be appropriate until
age 35 or 40, at which time we’d suggest switching to the
formula in Chapter 17. That would mean replacing the large-
company value fund with a target date fund.



==================================================
                     PAGE 141                     
==================================================

There really isn’t any rocket science that will tell you exactly
what combination will turn out the best.
To many people, the suggestion we just made will seem
relatively aggressive. If you want the benefit of small-
company value investing while holding only two funds in an
overall package that’s a bit more conservative, you could try
this: Follow the Chapter 17 formula, using with the farthest-
out Vanguard target date fund you can.
IRA accounts for minors may be hard to find, but Charles
Schwab offers them, as well as mutual funds and exchange-
traded funds suitable for following our recommendations.
Alternatively, you can open an account under the Uniform
Gifts to Minors Act. However, when the beneficiary becomes
an adult legally, they can use the assets in the account
without restriction. This means you give up control.
If you want more control of the situation (and if you’re
willing to accept the tax consequences), you can open an
account in your name and leave it in your will to the child.
In the meantime, as soon as the child has taxable earned
income, they will be eligible to contribute to an IRA. At that
point, you can withdraw enough from the account that you
own and make the contribution into a Roth IRA. This way,
you’ll make sure the money goes to work tax-free inside the
Roth IRA as soon as possible.
If you’re contemplating anything like this, we suggest you
have your plan reviewed ahead of time by a competent
financial advisor who’s familiar with tax laws.
Any way you do this, you’ll be making a thoughtful, generous
gift that could profoundly change somebody’s life.

GLOSSARY
Here are definitions of some of the terms used in this book
that may be unfamiliar.
A comprehensive glossary published by the U.S. government
is available online at
https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-
basics/glossary
Some of the following definitions are from that site, while we
have adapted others to fit the terms as we use them in this
book.
Active management — An attempt to exceed broad stock
market returns through stock selection or through timing of
purchases and sales, or both.
Asset class — Investments with similar characteristics. This
is a common term used to identify things like stocks, bonds,
cash, real estate and other investment vehicles. In this book,
we’re focused on different types of stocks, particularly small-
company stocks and large-company stocks.
Bear market — A time when stock prices are declining and
market sentiment is pessimistic. Generally, a bear market
occurs when a broad market index falls by 20% or more over
at least a two-month period.
Blend fund — A mutual fund that invests in both growth
stocks and value stocks.

==================================================

Broker — An individual who acts as an intermediary
between a buyer and seller, usually charging a commission to
execute trades.
Bull market — A time when stock prices are rising and
market sentiment is optimistic. Generally, a bull market
occurs when a broad market index rises by 20% or more over
at least a two-month period.
Capital gain — The profit that comes when an investment
is sold for more than the price the investor paid for it.
Compound interest — Interest paid on principal and on
accumulated interest.
Compound return — A compound rate of return is the
profit or loss on an investment over a one-year period,
assuming the investment is not sold, expressed as a
percentage. There are various ways of calculating this figure,
which is sometimes referred to as a compound rate of return
(CRR).
Diversification/diversify — A defensive investment
strategy that can be neatly summed up as “Don't put all your
eggs in one basket.” In this book, diversification refers
mostly to the practice of owning more than one asset class.
Drawdown — The difference in value of a portfolio between
a high point and a subsequent lowest point, usually
expressed as a percent of the high point.
Exchange-traded fund (ETF) — An investment company
that’s similar to a mutual fund except that it is traded on a
stock exchange with a price that varies moment to moment,
based on market prices, when the exchange is open for
business.



==================================================

==================================================

Expense ratio — In a mutual fund or exchange-traded
fund, the total annual operating expenses, including
management fees, distribution fees, and other expenses,
expressed as a percentage of average net assets.
Glide path — A plan of a mutual fund or portfolio to
gradually change the level of risk over time by changing the
overall mix of assets. In a target date fund, the glide path
attempts to reduce overall risk as shareholders approach
retirement.
Growth stock or growth fund — The stock of a company
with a relatively high price-to-earnings ratio. A mutual fund
that invests in such companies.
Inflation — A gradual increase in prices along with a
decline in the purchasing power of money.
Index fund — A low-cost mutual fund designed to achieve
approximately the same return as a stock index such as the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index without attempting to buy or
sell except when the components of the index change. Some
index funds invest in all the companies included in an index;
others invest in a representative sample.
Large-company stocks — Stocks with market
capitalizations typically more than $10 billion, contrasting
with small-company stocks, which typically average less than
$3 billion.
Load — An upfront sales charge that investors pay when
they buy mutual fund shares. The money is usually paid to
compensate brokers. This charge reduces the amount of
money that is actually invested for the benefit of the investor.
Market capitalization — The total value of a corporation
determined by multiplying the current market price of one



==================================================
                     PAGE 146                     
==================================================

share of stock by the total number of outstanding shares. As
used in this book, this term differentiates large-company
stocks (large corporations) from small-company stocks.
Market index — A market index tracks the performance of
a specific "basket" of stocks such as the Standard & Poor's
500 Index or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Mutual fund — An investment company that continuously
pools money from many investors and invests the money in
stocks, bonds, money market instruments or other securities.
Investors buy and sell shares in direct transactions with the
fund or sometimes through a broker. Share prices are fixed
at the end of each trading day, based on the prices of the
assets in the fund’s portfolio.
Portfolio — The combined investment holdings of an
individual or a mutual fund.
Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio — For a company with
publicly traded stock, an indicator of whether the current
stock price is high or low compared with past prices and/or
compared with stock prices of other companies. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the current stock price by the current
earnings per share.
Rebalancing — A process, usually done once a year,
designed to bring a portfolio back to its original and intended
asset allocation. This is desirable because, over time, some
investments grow faster than others, increasing or
decreasing the portfolio’s overall level of risk.
Risk — The possibility of losing money. Financial analysts
often measure risk using a statistic known as standard
deviation, which gauges the uncertainty of returns.

                     PAGE 147                     
==================================================

Small-company stocks — Stocks with market
capitalizations that typically average around $3 billion.
Contrasts with large-company stocks, which typically
average $50 billion.
Target date fund — A diversified mutual fund that uses a
glide path to automatically shift toward a more conservative
mix of investments as it approaches a target year when most
of its investors will presumably reach retirement age.
Value stock or value fund — The stock of a company with
a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio. A mutual fund that
invests in such companies.

RESOURCES
This book is designed to give you the tools you’ll need to turn
a series of relatively modest investments into a lifetime of
investing success. Our primary goal is to prod you into
action, not to suggest a course of study.
Obviously there is a great deal more you can learn about
investing. Once you have put Two Funds For Life into action,
we believe you will benefit from reading and listening to
some of the smartest people in the business.
The sources listed here are credible and reliable. However,
some of them may be sponsored by advertisers who don’t
necessarily have your best financial interests in mind. So be
careful in choosing where you put your trust.
For young investors
If you have time for just one more book, you could do much
worse than starting with How to Think About Money by
Jonathan Clements. It’s easy to read and packs a lifetime’s
worth of wisdom into fewer than 150 pages
If video is your preferred method of education, “2 Cents” on
PBS is a terrific series. Topics in the first season included the
lottery, the difficulty of saving for retirement, buying a
house, the dumb financial decisions many people make, and
whether the stock market is just a casino in disguise.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
Richard Buck
Richard Buck began subscribing to investment newsletters in
high school, and he’s never lost his fascination with all the
ways money can be put to work. After college, he began a 30-
year career as a journalist, including eight years as a writer
and editor at The Associated Press and 20 years as a business
reporter for The Seattle Times.
In 1993, he began writing for Paul Merriman; a few years
later, he joined Paul’s investment advisory firm as
publications manager. He and Paul have worked together on
countless articles and six other books, including Financial
Fitness Forever and Live It Up Without Outliving Your
Money. He has continued, since 2012, as Paul’s trusted
ghostwriter for The Merriman Financial Education
Foundation.
Rich’s writing has been published in travel magazines,
outdoor magazines, electronics magazines, and in America, a
publication of the U.S. State Department.
For retirement fun, he pursues a lifelong passion for radio by
producing his own show, available online and at various
stations nationwide. As his on-air persona, Sam Waldron,
Rich hosts “45 RPM, Music of the 40s and 50s”, a musical
journey back to the days when he was young. Each one-hour
show combines stories and recordings centered on a theme.

==================================================

In his spare time, he has been chairman of the board of a
Seattle credit union, co-founder of a non-profit international
exchange program, president of the Willamette University
Alumni Association, and a member of the Willamette
University Board of Trustees.
Paul Merriman
Financial educator, author and podcaster, Paul is nationally
recognized authority on mutual funds, index investing, asset
allocation and both buy and-hold and active management
strategies.
He began his career in the 1960s, working briefly as a stock
broker for a major Wall Street firm. Concluding that Wall
Street was burdened with too many conflicts of interest, he
decided to help small companies raise venture capital. In
1979, he became president and chairman of a public
manufacturing company in the Pacific Northwest,
and in 1983 founded an investment advisory firm, Merriman
Wealth Management (as it is now known). When he retired
and sold the firm in 2012, it had $1.6 billion under
management.
In 2011, Paul presented a Public Broadcasting Service
special, “Financial Fitness Over 50”, which was used as a
fundraiser for PBS stations nationwide. This piqued his
interest in teaching in retirement.
Upon retirement, he founded The Merriman Financial
Education Foundation, a registered 501(c)(3) dedicated to
providing free financial education to investors of all ages,
especially do-it yourselfers, helping them make informed
decisions and successfully implement their retirement
savings strategy.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Paul & Rich
We are deeply grateful to the many people without whom
this book would not have happened.
We’re especially indebted to two key members of the
Merriman Financial Education Foundation:
Chris Pedersen, director of research, suggested the basic
structure of the strategy we have outlined here, and
continued to guide us through the writing process.
Daryl Bahls, director of analytics, provided a wealth of data
and scores of tables for our study in addition to those
included in this book.
John Saul, Larry Swedroe and Susan Pelton gave us
invaluable guidance and suggestions from the point of view
of readers. Without their input, this book would not be
nearly as good as it is.
Aysha Griffin, communications director, provided editorial
consultation, proofread our manuscript and guided it into
existence as a book. Margie Baxley, website manager,
formatted the book into its present form. Jennifer Mah
contributed strategies to increase sales to help support the
foundation.



==================================================
                     PAGE 156                     
==================================================

Our spouses, Zan Merriman and Susan Pelton, have given us
unwavering support and encouragement.
In addition, each of us wants to recognize some people who
made it possible for us as individuals to reach the starting
point of this endeavor.
From Rich
I’m grateful to the people who sparked my interest in money
and investing and others who helped me mature as a writer.
To my grandfather, George Buck, who left a trust that helped
me and my siblings pay for college and let us split what was
left over. This made me realize I would someday have money
to invest.
To the authors of a little book I bought when I was in college,
who introduced me to fascinating concepts like international
investing, dollar-cost averaging, and mutual funds.
Some people helped me realize I could be a writer.
To my 6th grade teacher, Mrs. Edwards, the first person I
ever remember remarking (to the whole class, no less) that I
was a good writer.
To Stan Youngs, who responded to a letter I wrote him in my
early teens by writing back to say he was impressed by how I
had written it.
To my college astronomy professor, Maurice Stewart, who
announced to our class that a paper I had written was



==================================================
                     PAGE 157                     
==================================================

excellent and had taught him some things. (Wow!) He said
he gave the paper a grade of “C.” When I asked in
astonishment why, he replied: “You made two grammatical
errors. Those seem unimportant, I know. They are so
unimportant that there is no excuse for them.”
To three editors after college:
• Frank Gayman, city editor of the Yakima Herald, who
taught me to fear vague and sloppy writing. One day,
Frank read about half a story I had given him. Then while
everybody in the newsroom could see, Frank (we typed
our stories on paper back then) tossed my work on the
floor and bellowed: “Buck! Write this in English!”
• Basil Raffety, the editor at the first Associated Press
bureau where I worked, who taught me to trust my
instincts.
• Steve Dunphy, business editor at The Seattle Times, who
gave me license to be creative and showed by example
how to make financial writing meaningful to non-
financial people.
I’m also grateful to many other people who tolerated my
shortcomings (of which there were plenty) and celebrated
my successes over the years.
From Paul
I’m deeply grateful to all the people who taught me about
investing over the past half-century. First and foremost, the
thousands of investors who trusted me to help them through
the unending string of ups and downs in the market. They



==================================================
                     PAGE 158                     
==================================================

taught me by example what worked and (in a few memorable
cases) what didn’t work. They shared their hopes, their fears,
their successes, and their frustrations.
Many of these people became my friends, and I learned more
from them than I can ever repay.
I learned still more from my colleagues over 30 years while
building an advisory firm that operated under several names
and is now known as Merriman Wealth Management. These
dedicated professionals put up with my singing, my faulty
memory, and my messy office. Their talents and knowledge
opened my eyes to parts of the investment world I could have
otherwise missed.
I was blessed to have my son, Jeff, working hand-in-hand
with me as we built the firm.
I’m especially indebted to my personal Merriman advisor,
Tyler Bartlett. Among his many services, Tyler keeps me on
track by insulating my investments from my emotions.
Thanks to the people who, after I retired at age 69,
introduced me to new opportunities, including a national
PBS TV presentation, a regular column (still going) at
MarketWatch.com, plus countless speaking engagements
and lots of media exposure.
I’ve learned a lot from some of the best brains in the
business, including Warren Buffett, Larry Swedroe, Mark
Hulbert, and the late John Bogle.

My wife, Zan Merriman, encouraged me to focus my
retirement on helping first-time investors. That led to the
creation of The Merriman Financial Education Foundation, a
continuing financial education project at Western
Washington University, years of producing podcasts, articles,
videos and other educational materials, and to this book. Zan
has accepted a very different retirement life than she had
imagined; being married to a workaholic is not easy, but her
support has never failed me.
