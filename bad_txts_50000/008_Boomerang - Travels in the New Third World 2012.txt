PREFACE
THE BIGGEST SHORT
T
his book began accidentally, while I was at
work on another book, about Wall Street and
the 2008 U.S. financial disaster. I’d become
interested in a tiny handful of investors who
had made their fortunes from the collapse of
the subprime mortgage market. Back in
2004, the biggest Wall Street investment
banks had created the instrument of their
own destruction, the credit default swap on
the subprime mortgage bond. The credit de-
fault swap enabled investors to bet against
the price of any given bond—to “short” it. It

was an insurance policy, but with a twist: the
buyer didn’t need to own the insured asset.
No insurance company can legally sell you
fire protection on another person’s house,
but the financial markets can and will sell
you default insurance on another person’s
investments. Hundreds of investors had
dabbled in the credit default swap market—a
lot of people had thought, at least in passing,
that the debt-fueled U.S. housing boom was
unsustainable—but only fifteen or so had
gone all in, and placed enormous bets that
vast tracts of American finance would go up
in flames. Most of these people ran hedge
funds in London or New York; most, usually,
avoided journalists. But on this topic, at this
moment, they were surprisingly open. All
had experienced the strange and isolating
sensation of being the sane man in an insane
world and, when they talked about their ex-
perience, sounded as a person might if he
had sat alone and in silence in a small boat

and watched the Titanic steam into the
iceberg.
A few of these people were
temperamentally ill-suited to solitude and si-
lence. Among this subset was the manager of
a hedge fund called Hayman Capital, in Dal-
las, Texas. His name was Kyle Bass. Bass was
a native Texan in his late thirties who had
spent the first years of his career, seven of
them at Bear Stearns, selling bonds for Wall
Street firms. In late 2006 he’d taken half of
the $10 million he had saved from his Wall
Street career, raised another $500 million
from other people, created his hedge fund,
and made a massive wager against the
subprime mortgage bond market. Then he’d
flown to New York to warn his old friends
that they were on the wrong side of a lot of
stupid bets. The traders at Bear Stearns had
no interest in what he had to say. “You worry
about your risk management. I’ll worry
about ours,” one of them had told him. By

the end of 2008, when I went to Dallas to see
Bass, the subprime mortgage bond market
had collapsed, taking Bear Stearns with it.
He was now rich and even, in investment
circles, a little famous. But his mind had
moved on from the subprime mortgage bond
debacle: having taken his profits, he had a
new all-consuming interest, governments.
The United States government was just then
busytakingontoitsownbooksthesubprime
loans made by Bear Stearns and other Wall
Street banks. The Federal Reserve would
wind up absorbing the risk, in one form or
another, associated with nearly $2 trillion in
dodgy securities. Its actions were of a piece
with those of other governments in the rich,
developed world: the bad loans made by
highly paid financiers working in the private
sector were being eaten by national treasur-
ies and central banks everywhere.
In Kyle Bass’s opinion, the financial crisis
wasn’t over. It was simply being smothered

by the full faith and credit of rich Western
governments. I spent a day listening to him
and his colleagues discuss, almost giddily,
where this might lead. They were no longer
talking about the collapse of a few bonds.
They were talking about the collapse of en-
tire countries.
And they had a shiny new investment thes-
is. It ran, roughly, as follows. From 2002
there had been something like a false boom
in much of the rich, developed world. What
appeared to be economic growth was activity
fueled by people borrowing money they
probably couldn’t afford to repay: by their
rough count, worldwide debts, public and
private, had more than doubled since 2002,
from $84 trillion to $195 trillion. “We’ve
never had this kind of accumulation of debt
in world history,” said Bass. Critically, the
big banks that had extended much of this
credit were no longer treated as private en-
terprises but as extensions of their local

governments, suretobebailedoutinacrisis.
The public debt of rich countries already
stood at what appeared to be dangerously
high levels and, in response to the crisis, was
rapidly growing. But the public debt of these
countries was no longer the official public
debt. As a practical matter it included the
debts inside each country’s banking system,
which, in another crisis, would be trans-
ferred to the government. “The first thing we
tried to figure out,” said Bass, “was how big
these banking systems were, especially in re-
lation to government revenues. We took
aboutfourmonthstogatherthedata.Noone
had it.”
The numbers added up to astonishing
totals: Ireland, for instance, with its large
and growing annual deficits, had amassed
debts of more than twenty-five times its an-
nual tax revenues. Spain and France had ac-
cumulateddebtsofmorethantentimestheir
annual revenues. Historically, such levels of

15/396
government indebtedness had led to govern-
ment default. “Here’s the only way I think
things can work out for these countries,”
Bass said. “If they start running real budget
surpluses. Yeah, and that will happen right
aftermonkeys fly out of your ass.”
Still, he wondered if perhaps he was miss-
ing something. “I went looking for someone,
anyone, who knew something about the his-
tory of sovereign defaults,” he said. He found
the leading expert on the subject, a professor
at Harvard named Kenneth Rogoff, who, as
it happened, was preparing a book on the
history of national financial collapse, This
Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Finan-
cial Folly, with fellow scholar Carmen Rein-
hart. “We walked Rogoff through the num-
bers,” said Bass, “and he just looked at them,
then sat back in his chair, and said, ‘I can
hardlybelieve itisthisbad.’AndIsaid, ‘Wait
a minute. You’re the world’s foremost expert
on sovereign balance sheets. You are the go-

to guy for sovereign trouble. You taught at
Princeton with Ben Bernanke. You intro-
duced Larry Summers to his second wife. If
you don’t know this, who does?’ I thought,
Holy shit, who is paying attention?”
Thus his new investment thesis: the
subprime mortgage crisis was more symp-
tom than cause. The deeper social and eco-
nomic problems that gave rise to it re-
mained. The moment that investors woke up
to this reality, they would cease to think of
big Western governments as essentially risk-
free and demand higher rates of interest to
lend to them. When the interest rates on
their borrowing rose, these governments
would plunge further into debt, leading to
further rises in the interest rates they were
charged to borrow. In a few especially alarm-
ing cases—Greece, Ireland, Japan—it
wouldn’t take much of a rise in interest rates
for budgets to be consumed entirely by in-
terest payments on debt. “For example,” said

Bass, “if Japan had to borrow at France’s
rates, the interest burden alone would bank-
rupt the government.” The moment the fin-
ancial markets realized this, investor senti-
ment would shift. The moment investor sen-
timent shifted, these governments would de-
fault. (“Once you lose confidence, you don’t
get it back. You just don’t.”) And then what?
The financial crisis of 2008 was suspended
only because investors believed that govern-
ments could borrow whatever they needed to
rescue their banks. What happened when the
governments themselves ceased to be
credible?
There was another, bigger financial crisis
waiting to happen—the only question in Kyle
Bass’s mind was when. At the end of 2008,
he thought Greece would probably be the
first to go, perhaps triggering a collapse of
the euro. He thought it might happen within
two years, but he didn’t have a lot of convic-
tion about his timing. “Let’s say it takes five

yearsandnottwo,”hesaid.“Let’ssayittakes
seven years. Should I wait until I see the
whites of their eyes before I position myself,
or should I position myself now? The answer
is now. Because the moment people think it
[national default] is a possibility, it’s expens-
ive. If you wait, you have to pay up for the
risk.”
When we met, he had just bought his first
credit default swaps on the countries he and
his team ofanalysts viewed as themost likely
to be unable to pay off their debts: Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Portugal, and
Spain. He made these bets directly with the
few big Wall Street firms that he felt were
least likely to be allowed to fail—Goldman
Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stan-
ley—but, doubting their capacity to with-
stand a more serious crisis, he demanded
that they post collateral on the trades every
day. The prices he paid for default insurance,
in retrospect, look absurdly cheap. Greek

government default insurance cost him 11
basis points, for instance. That is, to insure
$1 million of Greek government bonds
against default, Hayman Capital paid a
premium of $1,100 dollars a year. Bass
guessed that when Greece defaulted, as it in-
evitably would, the country would be forced
to pay down its debt by roughly 70 per-
cent—which is to say that every $1,100 bet
would return $700,000. “There’s a disbelief
that a developed country can default, be-
cause we have never seen it in our lifetime,”
said Bass. “And it’s not in anyone’s interest
to pay attention to this. Even our own in-
vestors. They look at us and say, ‘Yeah, you
got subprime right. But you’re always out
there looking for these extremely rare events
and so you think they happen more often
than they do.’ But I didn’t go looking for this
position. I was trying to understand the way
the world was working, and this came to
me.” Now that he understood the way the

world was working, he continued, he
couldn’t see how any sane person could do
anything but prepare for another, bigger fin-
ancial catastrophe. “It may not be the end of
the world,” he said. “But a lot of people are
going to lose a lot of money. Our goal is not
to be one of them.”
He was totally persuasive. He was also
totally incredible. A guy sitting in an office in
Dallas, Texas, making sweeping claims about
the future of countries he’d hardly set foot
in: how on earth could he know how a bunch
of people he’d never met might behave? As
he laid out his ideas I had an experience I’ve
often had, while listening to people who
seem perfectly certain about uncertain
events. One part of me was swept away by
his argument and began to worry the world
was about to collapse; the other part suspec-
ted he might be nuts. “That’s great,” I said,
but I was already thinking about the flight I

needed to catch. “But even if you’re right,
what can any normal person do about it?”
He stared at me as if he’d just seen an in-
teresting sight: the world’s stupidest man.
“What do you tell your mother when she
asks you where to put her money?” I asked.
“Guns and gold,” he said simply.
“Guns and gold,” I said. So he was nuts.
“But not gold futures,” he said, paying no
attention to my thoughts. “You need physical
gold.” He explained that when the next crisis
struck, the gold futures market was likely to
seize up, as there were more outstanding fu-
tures contracts than available gold. People
who thought they owned gold would find
they owned pieces of paper instead. He
opened his desk drawer, hauled out a giant
gold brick, and dropped it on the desk.
“We’ve bought a lot of this stuff.”
At this point, I was giggling nervously and
glancing toward the door. The future is a lot
harder to predict than people on Wall Street

would have you believe. A man who has been
as dramatically right about the future as Kyle
Bass had been about the subprime mortgage
bond market collapse might easily fool him-
self into thinking he had a talent for being
dramatically right about all sorts of other
complicated things. At any rate, I was too in-
terested in trying to figure out what had just
happened in America to worry much about
what was going to happen in the rest of the
world, which seemed, at the time, a trivial
matter. And Bass had more or less lost in-
terest in what had just happened in America,
because he thought what was about to hap-
pen all around the world was so much more
important. I made my excuses, and took my
leave of Dallas, and more or less dismissed
him. When I wrote the book, I left Kyle Bass
on the cutting-room floor.
Then the financial world began to change
again—and very much as Kyle Bass had ima-
gined it might. Entire countries started to go

bust. What appeared at first to be a story
chiefly about Wall Street became a story that
involved every country that came into mean-
ingful contact with Wall Street. I wrote the
book about the U.S. subprime mortgage
crisis and the people who had made a for-
tune from it, but began to travel to these oth-
er places, just to see what was up. But I
traveled with a nagging question: how did a
hedge fund manager in Dallas even think to
imagine these strange events?
Two and a half years later, in the summer
of 2011, I returned to Dallas to ask Kyle Bass
that question. Greek credit default swaps
were up from 11 basis points to 2300; Greece
was just about to default on its national debt.
Ireland and Portugal had required massive
bailouts; and Spain and Italy had gone from
being viewed as essentially riskless to na-
tions on the brink of financial collapse. On
topofit all, theJapanese Ministry ofFinance
was about to send a delegation to the United

States to tour the big bond investment funds
such as Pimco and BlackRock—to see if they
could find someone, anyone, willing to buy
half a trillion dollars’ worth of ten-year
Japanese government bonds. “This is a scen-
ario in which no one alive has ever invested
before,” Bass said. “Our biggest positions
now are Japan and France. If and when the
dominoes fall, the worst, by far, is France. I
just hope the U.S. doesn’t collapse first. All
my money is bet that it won’t. That’s my
biggest fear. That I’m wrong about the chro-
nology of events. But I’m convinced what the
ultimate outcome is.”
He still owned stacks of gold and platinum
bars that had roughly doubled in value, but
he remained on the lookout for hard stores
of wealth as a hedge against what he as-
sumed was the coming debasement of fiat
currency. Nickels, for instance.

“The value of the metal in a nickel is worth
six point eight cents,” he said. “Did you know
that?”
I didn’t.
“I just bought a million dollars’ worth of
them,” he said, and then, perhaps sensing I
couldn’t do the math: “twenty million
nickels.”
“You bought twenty million nickels?”
“Uh-huh.”
“How do you buy twenty million nickels?”
“Actually, it’s very difficult,” he said, and
then explained that he had to call his bank
and talk them into ordering him twenty mil-
lion nickels. The bank had finally done it, but
the Federal Reserve had its own questions.
“The Fed apparently called my guy at the
bank,” he says. “They asked him, ‘Why do
you want all these nickels?’ So he called me
and asked, ‘Why do you want all these nick-
els?’ And I said, ‘I just like nickels.’”

He pulled out a photograph of his nickels
and handed it to me. There they were, piled
up on giant wooden pallets in a Brink’s vault
in downtown Dallas.
“I’m telling you, in the next two years
they’ll change the content of the nickel,” he
said. “You really ought to call your bank and
buy some now.”
I doubt Kyle Bass was ever the sort of per-
son who enjoyed sitting around an office and
staring at a computer screen. He enjoys the
unsettled life. We hopped into his Hummer,
decorated with bumper stickers (God Bless
Our Troops, Especially Our Snipers) and
customized to maximize the amount of fun
its owner could have in it: for instance, he
could press a button and, James Bond–like,
coat the road behind him in giant tacks. We
roared out into the Texas hill country, where,
with the fortune he’d made off the subprime
crisis, Kyle Bass had purchased what amoun-
ted to a fort: a forty-thousand-square-foot

ranch house on thousands of acres in the
middle of nowhere, with its own water sup-
ply, and an arsenal of automatic weapons
and sniper rifles and small explosives to
equip a battalion. That night we tore around
his property in the back of his U.S. Army
jeep, firing the very latest-issue U.S. Army
sniper rifles, equipped with infrared scopes,
at the beavers that he felt were a menace to
his waterways. “There are these explosives
you can buy on the Internet,” he said, as we
bounded over the yellow hills. “It’s a molecu-
lar reaction. FedEx will deliver hundreds of
pounds of these things.” The few beavers
that survived the initial night rifle assault
would wake up to watch their dams being
more or less vaporized.
“It doesn’t exactly sound like a fair fight,” I
said.
“Beavers are rodents,” he said.
Whatever else he was doing, he was clearly
having fun. He’d spent two and a half years

watching the global financial system, and the
people who ran it, confirm his dark view of
them. It didn’t get him down. It thrilled him
to have gotten his mind around seemingly
incomprehensible events. “I’m not someone
who is hell-bent on being negative his whole
life,” he said. “I think this is something we
need to go through. It’s atonement. It’s
atonement for the sins of the past.”
Once again a hedge fund manager had
been more or less right, and the world had
been more or less wrong. Now seemed as
good a time as any to pose the question that
had nagged at me for more than two years.
Here you are, I said, in so many words, an
essentially provincial hedge fund manager in
Dallas, Texas, whose entire adult life has
been lived within a few miles of this place.
You speak no foreign languages. You seldom
travel abroad. You are deeply patriotic: your
biggest philanthropic cause is wounded vet-
erans. You hardly know anyone who isn’t

American. How did it even occur to you to
start spinning theories about the financial
future of these distant countries?
“It was Iceland that got me going,” he said.
“I’ve always been interested in Iceland.”
“But why?”
“Did you ever play Risk as a kid?” he asked.
“I loved playing Risk. And I would always
put all of my armies on Iceland. Because you
could attackanybodyfrom there.”
The belief that he could attack anyone from
Iceland had led Kyle Bass to learn whatever
he could about Iceland, and to pay special at-
tention when something happened in Ice-
land. He found out, for instance, that Iceland
was held up by geographers as an example of
a country with a special talent for survival
against long environmental odds. “We kept
saying, ‘These banks are out of business.’ But
the government kept saving the banks,” he
said. “And right in the midst of this Iceland
went broke. And I thought, Wow, that’s

interesting. How, after a thousand years of
getting things right and overcoming all these
natural obstacles, did they get it so wrong?”
I had my answer. His interest had started
with a board game. It was ending with an-
other kind of board game. And Iceland was,
once again, a good place to start.

ust after October 6, 2008, when Iceland ef-
fectively went bust, I spoke to a man at the
International Monetary Fund who had been
flown in to Reykjavík to determine if money
might responsibly be lent to such a spectacu-
larly bankrupt nation. He’d never been to
Iceland, knew nothing about the place, and
said he needed a map to find it. He has spent
his life dealing with famously distressed
countries, usually in Africa, perpetually in
one kind of financial trouble or another.

Iceland was entirely new to his experience: a
nation of extremely well-to-do (No. 1 in the
United Nations’ 2008 Human Development
Index), well-educated, historically rational
human beings who had organized them-
selves to commit one of the single greatest
acts of madness in financial history. “You
have to understand,” he told me, “Iceland is
no longer a country. It is a hedge fund.”
An entire nation without immediate exper-
ience or even distant memory of high finance
had gazed upon the example of Wall Street
and said, “We can do that.” For a brief mo-
ment it appeared that they could. In 2003,
Iceland’s three biggest banks had assets of
only a few billion dollars, about 100 percent
of the country’s gross domestic product.
Over the next three and a half years the
banking assets grew to over $140 billion and
were so much greater than Iceland’s GDP
that it made no sense to calculate the per-
centage of it they accounted for. It was, as

times. Reykjavík real estate prices tripled. In
2006 the average Icelandic family was three
times as wealthy as the average Icelandic
family had been in 2003, and virtually all of
this new wealth was, in one way or another,
tied to the new investment banking industry.
“Everyone was learning Black-Scholes” (the
option-pricing model), says Ragnar Arnason,
a professor of fishing economics at the
University of Iceland, who watched students
flee the economics of fishing for the econom-
ics of money. “The schools of engineering

And yet the world was taking Iceland seri-
ously. (March 2006 Bloomberg News head-
line: ICELAND'S BILLIONAIRE TYCOON "THOR"
BRAVES U.S. WITH HEDGE FUND.)
Global financial ambition turned out to
have a downside. When their three brand-
new global-size banks collapsed, Iceland’s
300,000 citizens found that they bore some
kind of responsibility for $100 billion in
banking losses—which works out to roughly
$330,000 for every Icelandic man, woman,
and child. On top of that they had tens of bil-
lions of dollars in personal losses from their
own bizarre private foreign-currency

speculation, and even more from the 85 per-
cent collapse in the Icelandic stock market.
The exact dollar amount of Iceland’s finan-
cial hole was essentially unknowable, as it
depended upon the value of the generally
stable Icelandic krona, which had also
crashed and was removed from the market
by the government. But it was a lot.
Iceland instantly became the only nation
on earth that Americans could point to and
say, “Well, at least we didn’t do that.” In the
end, Icelanders amassed debts amounting to
850 percent of their GDP. (The debt-
drowned United States has reached just 350
percent.) As absurdly big and important as
Wall Street became in the U.S. economy, it
never grew so large that the rest of the popu-
lation could not, in a pinch, bail it out. Each
one of the three Icelandic banks suffered
losses too large for the nation to bear; taken
together they were so ridiculously out of pro-
portion that, within weeks of the collapse, a

third of the population told pollsters that
they were considering emigration.
In just three or four years an entirely new
way of economic life had been grafted onto
the side of this stable, collectivist society,
and the graft had overwhelmed the host. “It
was just a group of young kids,” said the man
from the IMF. “In this egalitarian society,
they came in, dressed in black, and started
doing business.”

like moose, rams, and other horned mam-

their struggle for survival. I will also learn
that this particular Icelandic male is a senior

moment, however, all I know is that a
middle-aged man in an expensive suit has
gone out of his way to bash bodies without
apology or explanation. I stew on this appar-
ently wanton act of hostility all the way to
passport control.
You can tell a lot about a country by ob-
serving how much better they treat them-
selves than foreigners at the point of entry.
Let it be known that Icelanders make no dis-
tinction at all. Over the control booth they’ve
hung a charming sign that reads simply, ALL
CITIZENS, and what they mean by that is not
“All Icelandic Citizens” but “All Citizens of
Anywhere.” Everyone is from somewhere,
and so we all wind up in the same line,

convened a meeting of British and American
hedge fund managers here, in January 2008,
to figure out how much money there was to
be made betting on Iceland’s collapse. (A
lot.) The hotel, once jammed, is now empty,
with only six of its thirty-eight rooms occu-

the people who weren’t in them to marvel at

just depressing; a bankrupt Ian Schrager

With the financiers who once paid a lot to
stay here gone for good, I’m given a big room
on the top floor with a view of the old city for
half-price. I curl up in silky white sheets and
reach for a book about the Icelandic eco-
nomy—written in 1995, before the banking
craze, when the country had little to sell to
the outside world but fresh fish—and read
this remarkable sentence: “Icelanders are
rather suspicious of the market system as a

cornerstone of economic organization, espe-
cially its distributive implications.”
That’s when the strange noises commence.
First, the banging of a bed frame against
the wall, followed by various moans and
high-pitched yells. The couple in the next
room has returned for the evening. Their
noises grow louder but what’s strange is that
nomatterhowloudtheygrow,orhowclearly
I can hear them, the words that accompany
them remain totally incomprehensible. Find-
ing it hard to concentrate on The Icelandic
Fisheries, I instead try to mimic the sounds
coming though my wall—but when I do my
tongue is doing things in my mouth that it’s
never done before. The sounds from the oth-
er side of the wall are roughly those made by
the Stoor hobbit in Lord of the Rings. Gol-
lum . . . Gollum! . . . Mordor . . . Mordor!
Then I realize: it’s just Icelandic.
Next comes a screeching from the far side
of the room. I leave the bed to examine the

situation. It’s the heat, sounding like a teak-
ettle left on the stove for too long, straining
to control itself. Iceland’s heat isn’t heat as
we know it, but heat drawn directly from the
earth. The default temperature of the water
is scalding. Every year workers engaged in
street repairs shut down the cold-water in-
take used to temper the hot water and some
poor Icelander is essentially boiled alive in
his shower. So powerful is the heat being re-
leased from the earth into my room that
some great grinding, wheezing engine must
be employed to prevent it from cooking me.
Finally, from outside, comes an explosion.
Boom!
Then another.
Boom!
AS IT IS mid-December, the sun rises, barely,
at 10:50 A.M. and sets with enthusiasm at
3:44 P.M.This is obviously better than no sun
at all, but subtly worse, as it tempts you to
believe you can simulate a normal life. And

whatever else this place is, it isn’t normal.
The point is reinforced by a twenty-six-year-
old Icelander I’ll call Magnus Olafsson, who,
just a few weeks earlier, had been earning
close to a million dollars a year trading cur-
rencies for one of the banks. Tall, white-
blond, and handsome, Olafsson looks exactly
as you’d expect an Icelander to look—which
is to say that he looks not at all like most
Icelanders, who are mousy-haired and
lumpy. “My mother has enough food
hoarded to open a grocery store,” he says,
then adds that ever since the crash Reykjavík
has felt tense and uneasy.
Two months earlier, in early October, as
the market for Icelandic kronur dried up,
he’d sneaked away from his trading desk and
gone down to the teller, where he’d extracted
as much foreign cash as they’d give him and
stuffed it into a sack. “All over downtown
that day you saw people walking around with
bags,” he says. “No one ever carries bags

around downtown.” After work he’d gone
home with his sack of cash and hidden
roughly 30 grand in yen, dollars, euros, and
pounds sterling inside a board game.
Before October the big-name bankers were
heroes; now they are abroad, or lying low.
Before October Magnus thought of Iceland
as essentially free of danger; now he ima-
gines hordes of muggers en route from for-
eign nations to pillage his board-game
safe—and thus refuses to allow me to use his
real name. “You’d figure New York would
hear about this and send over planeloads of
muggers,” he theorizes. “Most everyone has
their savings at home.” As he is already un-
settled, I tell him about the unsettling explo-
sions outside my hotel room. “Yes,” he says
with a smile, “there’s been a lot of Range
Rovers catching fire lately.” Then he
explains.
For the past few years, some large number
of Icelanders engaged in the same disastrous

speculation. With local interest rates at 15.5
percent and the krona rising, they decided
the smart thing to do, when they wanted to
buy something they couldn’t afford, was to
borrow not kronur but yen and Swiss francs.
They paid 3 percent interest on the yen and
in the bargain made a bundle on the cur-
rency trade, as the krona kept rising. “The
fishing guys pretty much discovered the
trade and made it huge,” says Magnus. “But
they made so much money on it that the fin-
ancial stuff eventually overwhelmed the
fish.” They made so much money on it that
the trade spread from the fishing guys to
their friends.
It must have seemed like a no-brainer: buy
these ever more valuable houses and cars
with money you are, in effect, paid to bor-
row. But, in October, after the krona col-
lapsed, the yen and Swiss francs they must
repay became many times more expensive.
Now many Icelanders—especially young

Icelanders—own $500,000 houses with $1.5
million mortgages, and $35,000 Range
Rovers with $100,000 in loans against them.
To the Range Rover problem there are two
immediate solutions. One is to put it on a
boat, ship it to Europe, and try to sell it for a
currency that still has value. The other is set
it on fire and collect the insurance: Boom!
The rocks beneath Reykjavík may be ig-
neous, but the city feels sedimentary: on top
of several thick strata of architecture that
should be called Nordic Pragmatic lies a thin
layer that will almost certainly one day be
known as Asshole Capitalist. The hobbit-size
buildings that house the Icelandic govern-
ment are charming and scaled to the city.
The half-built oceanfront glass towers meant
to house newly rich financiers and, in the
bargain, block everyone else’s view of the
white bluffs across the harbor are not.

me without so much as a by-your-leave. Just
for fun I march up and down the main shop-
ping drag, playing chicken, to see if any
Icelandic male would rather divert his stride
than bang shoulders. Nope. On party
nights—Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday—when half the country appears to
take it as a professional obligation to drink
themselves into oblivion and wander the
streets until what should be sunrise, the
problem is especially acute. The bars stay
open until five in the morning, and the
frantic energy with which the people hit
themseemsmorelikeworkthanwork. With-
in minutes of entering a nightclub called Bo-
ston I get walloped, first by a bearded troll
who, I’m told, ran an Icelandic hedge fund.
Just as I’m recovering I get plowed over by a
drunken senior staffer at the Central Bank.
Perhaps because he is drunk, or perhaps be-
cause we had actually met a few hours earli-
er, he stops to tell me, “Vee try to tell them

dat our problem was not a solfency problem
but a likvitity problem, but they did not
agree,” then stumbles off. It’s exactly what
Lehman Brothers and Citigroup said: if only
you’d give us the money to tide us over, we’ll
survive this little hiccup.
A nation so tiny and homogeneous that
everyone in it knows pretty much everyone
else is so fundamentally different from what
one thinks of when one hears the word “na-
tion” that it almost requires a new classifica-
tion. Really, it’s lessanation than onebigex-
tended family. For instance, most Icelanders
are by default members of the Lutheran
Church. If they want to stop being Lutherans
they must write to the government and quit;
on the other hand, if they fill out a form, they
can start their own cult and receive a sub-
sidy. Another example: the Reykjavík phone
book lists everyone by his first name, as
there are only about nine surnames in Ice-
land, and they are derived by prefixing the

father’s name to “son” or “dóttir.” It’s hard to
see how this clarifies matters, as there seem
to be only about nine first names in Iceland,
too. But if you wish to reveal how little you
knowaboutIceland,youneedmerelyreferto
someone named Siggor Sigfússon as “Mr.
Sigfússon,” or Kristin Pétursdóttir as “Ms.
Pétursdóttir.” At any rate, everyone in a con-
versation is just meant to know whomever
you’re talking about, so you never hear any-
one ask, “Which Siggor do you mean?”
Because Iceland is really just one big fam-
ily, it’s simply annoying to go around asking
Icelanders if they’ve met Björk. Of course
they’ve met Björk; who hasn’t met Björk?
Who, for that matter, didn’t know Björk
when she was two? “Yes, I know Björk,” a
professor of finance at the University of Ice-
land says in reply to my question, in a weary
tone. “She can’t sing, and I know her mother
from childhood, and they were both crazy.
That she is so well known outside of Iceland

tells me more about the world than it does
about Björk.”
One benefit of life inside a nation masking
an extended family is that nothing needs to
be explained; everyone already knows
everything that needs to be known. I quickly
find that it is an even greater than usual
waste of time to ask directions, for instance.
Just as you are meant to know which Bjorn-
jolfer is being spoken of at any particular
moment, you are meant to know where you
are on the map. Two grown-ups—one a
banker whose office is three blocks
away—cannot tell me where to find the
prime minister’s office. Three more grown-
ups, all within three blocks of the National
GalleryofIceland,havenoideawheretofind
the place. When I tell the sweet middle-aged
woman behind the counter at the National
Museum that no Icelander seems to know
how to find it, she says, “No one actually
knows anything about our country. Last

week we had Icelandic high school students
here and their teacher asked them to name
an Icelandic nineteenth-century painter.
None of them could. Not a single one! One
said, ‘Halldór Laxness?’!” (Laxness won the
1955 Nobel Prize in Literature, the greatest
global honor for an Icelander until the
1980s, when two Icelandic women, in rapid
succession, captured Miss World titles.)
THEWORLDIS now pocked with cities that feel
as if they are perched on top of bombs. The
bombs have yet to explode, but the fuses
have been lit, and there’s nothing anyone can
do to extinguish them. Walking around Man-
hattan just before the collapse of Lehman
Brothers, you saw empty stores, empty
streets, and, even when it was raining, empty
taxis; the people had fled before the bomb
exploded. Reykjavík had the same feel of in-
cipient doom, but the fuse burned strangely.
The government mandates three months’
severance pay, and so the many laid-off

bankers were paid until early February,
when the government promptly fell. Against
a basket of foreign currencies the krona is
worth less than a third of its boom-time
value. As Iceland imports everything but
heat and fish, the price of just about
everything is, in mid-December, about to
skyrocket. A new friend who works for the
government tells me that she went into a
storetobuyalamp.Theclerktoldherhehad
sold the last of the lamps she was after but
offered to order it for her, from Sweden—at
nearly three times the old price.
Still, a society that has been ruined
overnight doesn’t look much different from
how it did the day before, when it believed it-
self to be richer than ever. The Central Bank
of Iceland is a case in point. Almost certainly
Iceland will adopt the euro as its currency,
and the krona will cease to exist. Without it
there is no need for a central bank to main-
tain the stability of the local currency and

control interest rates. Inside the place stews
DavidOddsson,thearchitectofIceland’s rise
and fall. Back in the 1980s, Oddsson had
fallen under the spell of Milton Friedman,
the brilliant economist who was able to per-
suade even those who spent their lives work-
ing for the government that government was
a waste of life. So Oddsson went on a quest
to give Icelandic people their freedom, by
which he meant freedom from government
controls of any sort. As prime minister he
lowered taxes, privatized industry, freed up
trade, and, finally, in 2002, privatized the
banks. At length, weary of prime-minister-
ing, he got himself appointed governor of the
Central Bank—even though he had no exper-
ience in banking and was, by training, a poet.
After the collapse, this disciple of Milton
Friedman holed up in his office inside the
bank, declining all requests for interviews.
Senior government officials tell me, seri-
ously, that they assume he spends most of

different. The fuse is burning its way toward
the bomb.
When Neil Armstrong took his small step
from Apollo 11 and looked around, he prob-
ablythought,Wow,sortoflikeIceland—even
though the moon was nothing like Iceland.
But then, he was a tourist, and a tourist can’t
help but have a distorted opinion of a place:
he meets unrepresentative people, has un-
representative experiences, and runs around
imposing upon the place the fantastic mental

pictures he had in his head when he got
there. When Iceland became a tourist in
global high finance it had the same problem
as Neil Armstrong. Icelanders are among the
most inbred human beings on earth—geneti-
cists often use them for research. They in-
habited their remote island for 1,100 years
without so much as dabbling in leveraged
buyouts (LBOs), hostile takeovers, derivat-
ives trading, or even small-scale financial
fraud. When, in 2003, they sat down at the
same table with Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, they had only the roughest idea of
what an investment banker did and how he
behaved—most of it gleaned from young
Icelanders’ experiences at various American
business schools. And so what they did with
money probably says as much about the
American soul, circa 2003, as it does about
Icelanders. They understood instantly, for
instance, that finance had less to do with
productive enterprise than trading bits of

paper among themselves. And when they
lent money they didn’t simply facilitate en-
terprisebutbankrolled friendsandfamily, so
that they might buy and own things, like real
investment bankers: Beverly Hills condos,
British soccer teams and department stores,
Danish airlines and media companies, Nor-
wegian banks, Indian power plants.
That was the biggest American financial
lesson the Icelanders took to heart: the im-
portance of buying as many assets as pos-
sible with borrowed money, as asset prices
only rose. By 2007, Icelanders owned
roughly fifty times more foreign assets than
they had in 2002. They bought private jets
and third homes, in London and Copenha-
gen. They paid vast sums of money for ser-
vices no one in Iceland had theretofore ever
imagined wanting. “A guy had a birthday
party, and he flew in Elton John for a million
dollars to sing two songs,” the head of the
Left-Green Movement, Steingrimur

Sigfússon, tells me with fresh incredulity.
“And apparently not very well.” They bought
stakes in businesses they knew nothing
about and told the people running them
what to do—just like real American invest-
ment bankers! For instance, an investment
company called FL Group—a major share-
holder in Glitnir bank—bought an 8.25 per-
cent stake in American Airlines’ parent cor-
poration. No one inside FL Group had ever
actually run an airline; no one in FL Group
even had meaningful work experience at an
airline. That didn’t stop FL Group from
telling American Airlines how to run an air-
line. “After taking a close look at the com-
pany over an extended period of time,” FL
Group CEO Hannes Smárason, a graduate of
MIT’s Sloan School, got himself quoted say-
ing, in his press release, not long after he
bought his shares, “our suggestions include
monetizing assets . . . that can be used to re-
duce debt or return capital to shareholders.”

Nor were the Icelanders particularly
choosy about what they bought. I spoke with
a hedge fund in New York that, in late 2006,
spotted what it took to be an easy mark: a
weak Scandinavian bank getting weaker. It
established a short position, and then, out of
nowhere, came Kaupthing to take a 10 per-
cent stake in this soon to be defunct enter-
prise, driving up the share price to absurd
levels. I spoke to another hedge fund in Lon-
don so perplexed by the many bad LBOs
Icelandic banks were financing that it hired
private investigators to figure out what was
going on in the Icelandic financial system.
The investigators produced a chart detailing
a byzantine web of interlinked entities that
boiled down to this: a handful of guys in Ice-
land who had no experience in finance were
taking out tens of billions of dollars in short-
term loans from abroad. They were then re-
lending this money to themselves and their
friends to buy assets—the banks, soccer

teams, etc. Since the entire world’s assets
were rising—thanks in part to people like
these Icelandic lunatics paying crazy prices
for them—they appeared to be making
money. Yet another hedge fund manager ex-
plained Icelandic banking to me this way:
you have a dog, and I have a cat. We agree
that each is worth a billion dollars. You sell
me the dog for a billion, and I sell you the cat
for a billion. Now we are no longer pet own-
ers but Icelandic banks, with a billion dollars
in new assets. “They created fake capital by
trading assets amongst themselves at in-
flated values,” says a London hedge fund
manager. “This was how the banks and in-
vestmentcompaniesgrewandgrew.Butthey
were lightweights in the international
markets.”
ON FEBUARY 3, Tony Shearer, the former CEO
of a British merchant bank called Singer &
Friedlander, offered a glimpse of the inside
when he appeared before a House of

Commons committee to describe his bizarre
experience of being acquired by an Icelandic
bank.
Singer & Friedlander had been around
since 1907 and was famous for, among other
things, giving George Soros his start. In
November 2003, Shearer learned that
Kaupthing, of whose existence he was totally
unaware, had just taken a 9.5 percent stake
in his bank. Normally, when a bank tries to
buy another bank, it seeks to learn
something about it. Shearer offered to meet
with Kaupthing’s chairman, Sigurdur
Einarsson; Einarsson had no interest. When
Kaupthing raised its stake to 19.5 percent,
Shearer finally flew to Reykjavík to see who
on earth these Icelanders were. “They were
very different,” he told the House of Com-
mons committee. “They ran their business in
a very strange way. Everyone there was in-
credibly young. They were all from the same

community in Reykjavík. And they had no
idea what they were doing.”
He examined Kaupthing’s annual reports
and discovered some amazing facts: this gi-
ant international bank had only one board
member who was not Icelandic, for instance.
Its directors all had four-year contracts, and
the bank had lent them £19 million to buy
shares in Kaupthing, along with options to
sell those shares back to the bank at a guar-
anteed profit. Virtually the entire bank’s
stated profits were caused by its marking up
assets it had bought at inflated prices. “The
actual amount of profits that were coming
from what I’d call banking was less than 10
percent,” said Shearer.
In a sane world the British regulators
would have stopped the new Icelandic finan-
ciers from devouring the ancient British
merchant bank. Instead, the regulators ig-
nored a letter Shearer wrote to them. A year
later, in January 2005, he received a phone

call from the British takeover panel. “They
wanted to know,” says Shearer, “why our
share price had risen so rapidly over the past
coupleofdays.SoIlaughedandsaid,‘Ithink
you’ll find the reason is that Mr. Einarsson,
the chairman of Kaupthing, said two days
ago, like an idiot, that he was going to make
a bid for Singer & Friedlander.’” In August
2005, Singer & Friedlander became Kaupth-
ing Singer & Friedlander, and Shearer quit,
he says, out of fear of what might happen to
his reputation if he stayed. Sure enough, in
October 2008, Kaupthing Singer & Fried-
lander went bust.
In spite of all this, when Tony Shearer was
pressedbytheHouseofCommonstocharac-
terize the Icelanders as mere street hustlers,
he refused. “They were all highly educated
people,” he said in a tone of amazement.
HERE IS YET another way in which Iceland
echoed the American model: all sorts of
people, none of them Icelandic, tried to tell

them they had a problem. In early 2006, for
instance, an analyst named Lars Christensen
and three of his colleagues at Denmark’s
biggest bank, Danske Bank, wrote a report
that said Iceland’s financial system was
growing at a mad pace and was on a collision
course with disaster. “We actually wrote the
report because we were worried our clients
were getting too interested in Iceland,” he
tells me. “Iceland was the most extreme of
everything.” Christensen then flew to Iceland
and gave a speech to reinforce his point, only
to be greeted with anger. “The Icelandic
banks took it personally,” he says. “We were
being threatened with lawsuits. I was told,
‘You’re Danish, and you are angry with Ice-
land because Iceland is doing so well.’ Basic-
ally it all had to do with what happened in
1944,” when Iceland declared its independ-
ence from Denmark. “The reaction wasn’t,
‘These guys might be right.’ It was, ‘No! It’s a

conspiracy. They have bad motives.’” The
Danish were just jealous!
The Danske Bank report alerted hedge
funds in London to an opportunity: shorting
Iceland. They investigated and found this in-
credible web of cronyism: bankers buying
stuff from one another at inflated prices,
borrowing tens of billions of dollars and re-
lending it to the members of their little
Icelandic tribe, who then used it to buy up a
messy pile of foreign assets. “Like any new
kid on the block,” says Theo Phanos, of Tra-
falgar Asset Managers, in London, “they
were picked off by various people who sold
them the lowest-quality assets—second-tier
airlines, sub-scale retailers. They were in all
the worst LBOs.”
But from the prime minister on down, Ice-
land’s leaders attacked the messenger. “The
attacks . . . give off an unpleasant odor of un-
scrupulous dealers who have decided to
make a last stab at breaking down the

Icelandic financial system,” said Central
Bank chairman Oddsson in March 2009. The
chairman of Kaupthing publicly fingered
four hedge funds that he said were deliber-
ately seeking to undermine Iceland’s finan-
cial miracle. “I don’t know where the
Icelanders get this notion,” says Paul Rud-
dock, of Lansdowne Partners, one of those
fingered. “We only once traded in an
Icelandic stock and it was a very short-term
trade. We started to take legal action against
the chairman of Kaupthing after he made
public accusations against us that had no
truth, and then he withdrew them.”
One of the hidden causes of the current
global financial crisis is that the people who
saw it coming had more to gain from it by
taking short positions than they did by trying
to publicize the problem. Plus, most of the
people who could credibly charge Ice-
land—or, for that matter, Lehman Broth-
ers—with financial crimes could be

dismissed as crass profiteers, talking their
own book. Back in April 2006, however, an
emeritus professor of economics at the
University of Chicago named Bob Aliber took
an interest in Iceland. Aliber found himself
at the London Business School, listening to a
talk on Iceland, about which he knew noth-
ing. He recognized the signs instantly. Dig-
ging into the data, he found in Iceland the
outlines of what was so clearly a historic act
of financial madness that it belonged in a
textbook. “The Perfect Bubble,” Aliber calls
Iceland’s financial rise, and he has the text-
book in the works: an updated version of
Charles Kindleberger’s 1978 classic, Manias,
Panics, and Crashes. Aliber is editing the
new edition. In it, Iceland, he decided back
in 2006, would now have its own little box,
along with the South Sea Bubble and tulip
mania—even though Iceland had yet to
crash. For him the actual crash was a mere
formality.

Word spread in Icelandic economic circles
that this distinguished professor at Chicago
had taken a special interest in Iceland. In
May 2008, Aliber was invited by the
University of Iceland’s economics depart-
ment to give a speech. To an audience of stu-
dents, bankers, and journalists, he explained
that Iceland, far from having an innate talent
for high finance, had all the markings of a gi-
ant bubble, but he spoke the technical lan-
guage of academic economists. (“Monetary
Turbulence and the Icelandic Economy,” he
called his speech.) In the following Q&A ses-
sion someone asked him to predict the fu-
ture, and he lapsed into plain English. As an
audience member recalls, Aliber said, “I give
you nine months. Your banks are dead. Your
bankers are either stupid or greedy. And I’ll
bet they are on planes trying to sell their as-
sets right now.”
The Icelandic bankers in the audience
sought to prevent newspapers from

reporting the speech. Several academics sug-
gested that Aliber deliver his alarming ana-
lysis to Iceland’s Central Bank. Somehow
that never happened. “The Central Bank said
they were too busy to see him,” says one of
theprofessors whotried toarrange themeet-
ing, “because they were preparing the Report
on Financial Stability.” For his part Aliber
left Iceland thinking that he’d caused such a
stir he might not be allowed back into the
country. “I got the feeling,” he told me, “that
the only reason they brought me in was that
they needed an outsider to say these
things—that an insider wouldn’t say these
things, because he’d be afraid of getting into
trouble.” And yet he remains extremely fond
of his hosts. “They are a very curious
people,” he says, laughing. “I guess that’s the
point, isn’t it?”
Icelanders—or at any rate Icelandic
men—had their own explanations for why,
when they leapt into global finance, they

broke world records: the natural superiority
of Icelanders. Because they were small and
isolated, it had taken 1,100 years for
them—and the world—to understand and ex-
ploit their natural gifts, but now that the
world was flat and money flowed freely, un-
fair disadvantages had vanished. Iceland’s
president, Ólafur Ragnar Grimsson, gave
speeches abroad in which he explained why
Icelanders were banking prodigies. “Our her-
itage and training, our culture and home
market, have provided a valuable advant-
age,” he said, then went on to list nine of
these advantages, ending with how unthreat-
ening to others Icelanders are. (“Some
people even see us as fascinating eccentrics
who can do no harm.”) There were many,
many expressions of this same sentiment,
most of them in Icelandic. “There were re-
search projects at the university to explain
why the Icelandic business model was super-
ior,” says Gylfi Zoega, chairman of the

economics department. “It was all about our
informal channels of communication and
ability to make quick decisions and so forth.”
“We were always told that the Icelandic
businessmen were so clever,” says university
finance professor and former banker Vil-
hjálmur Bjarnason. “They were very quick.
And when they bought something they did it
very quickly. Why was that? That is usually
because the seller is very satisfied with the
price.”
You didn’t need to be Icelandic to join the
cult of the Icelandic banker. German banks
put $21 billion into Icelandic banks. The
Netherlands gave them $305 million, and
Sweden kicked in $400 million. UK in-
vestors, lured by the eye-popping 14 percent
annual returns, forked over $30 billion—$28
billion from companies and individuals and
the rest from pension funds, hospitals, uni-
versities, and other public institutions. Ox-
ford University alone lost $50 million.

Maybe because there are so few Icelanders
in the world, we know next to nothing about
them. We assume they are more or less
Scandinavian—a gentle people who just want
everyone to have the same amount of
everything. They are not. They have a feral
streak in them, like a horse that’s just pre-
tending to be broken.
AFTER THREE DAYS in Reykjavík, I receive,
more or less out of the blue, two phone calls.
The first is from a producer of a leading
current-events TV show. All of Iceland
watches her show, she says, then asks if I’d
come on and be interviewed.
“About what?” I ask.
“We’d like you to explain our financial
crisis,” she says.
“I’ve only been here three days!” I say.
It doesn’t matter, she says, as no one in
Iceland understands what’s happened.
They’d enjoy hearing someone try to explain
it, even if that person didn’t have any idea

what he was talking about—which goes to
show, I suppose, that not everything in Ice-
land is different from other places. As I de-
mur, another call comes, from the prime
minister’s office.
Iceland’s then prime minister, Geir
Haarde, was also the head of the Independ-
ence Party, which governed the country from
1991 to 2009. It ruled in loose coalition with
the Social Democrats and the Progressive
Party. (Iceland’s fourth major party is the
Left-Green Movement.) That a nation of
300,000 people, all of whom are related by
blood, needs four major political parties sug-
gests either a talent for disagreement or an
unwillingness to listen to one another. In any
case, of the four parties, the Independents
express the greatest faith in free markets.
The Independence Party is the party of the
fishermen. It is also, as an old schoolmate of
the prime minister’s puts it to me, “all men,
men, men. Not a woman in it.”

Walking into the PM’s minute headquar-
ters, I expect to be stopped and searched, or
at least asked for photo identification. In-
stead I find a single policeman sitting behind
a reception desk, feet up on the table, read-
ing a newspaper. He glances up, bored. “I’m
here to see the prime minister,” I say for the
first time in my life. He’s unimpressed.
Anyoneherecanseetheprimeminister.Half
a dozen people will tell me that one of the
reasons Icelanders thought they would be
taken seriously as global financiers is that all
Icelanders feel important. One reason they
all feel important is that they all can go see
the prime minister anytime they like.
What the prime minister might say to the
Icelanders about their collapse is an open
question. There’s a charming lack of finan-
cial experience in Icelandic financial-policy-
making circles. The minister for business af-
fairs is a philosopher. The finance minister is
a veterinarian. The Central Bank governor is

a poet. Haarde, though, is a trained econom-
ist—just not a very good one. The economics
department at the University of Iceland has
him pegged as a B-minus student. As a
group, the Independence Party’s leaders
have a reputation for not knowing much
about finance and for refusing to avail them-
selves of experts who do. An Icelandic pro-
fessor at the London School of Economics
named Jon Danielsson, who specializes in
financial panics, has had his offer to help
spurned; so have several well-known finan-
cial economists at the University of Iceland.
Even the advice of really smart Central
Bankers from seriously big countries went
ignored. It’s not hard to see why the
Independence Party and its prime minister
fail to appeal to Icelandic women: they are
the guy driving his family around in search
ofsomefamiliar landmark andrefusing, over
his wife’s complaints, to stop and ask
directions.

“Why are you interested in Iceland?” he
asks, as he strides into the room with the
force and authority of the leader of a much
larger nation. And it’s a good question.
As it turns out, he’s not actually stupid, but
political leaders seldom are, no matter how
muchthepeoplewhoelectedtheminsistthat
it must be so. He does indeed say things that
could not possibly be true, but they are only
the sorts of fibs that prime ministers are
hired to tell. He claims that the krona is once
again an essentially stable currency, for in-
stance, when the truth is it doesn’t trade in
international markets. The krona is simply
assigned an arbitrary value by the govern-
ment for select purposes. Icelanders abroad
have already figured out not to use their Visa
cards, for fear of being charged the real ex-
change rate, whatever that might be.
The prime minister would like me to be-
lieve that he saw Iceland’s financial crisis
taking shape but could do little about it.

(“We could not say publicly our fears about
the banks, because you create the very thing
you are seeking to avoid: a panic.”) By im-
plication it was not politicians like him but
financiers who were to blame. On some level
the people agree: the guy who ran the
Baugur investment group had snowballs
chucked at him as he dashed from the 101
Hoteltohislimo;theguywhoranKaupthing
Bank turned up at the National Theatre and,
as he took his seat, was booed. But, for the
most part, the big shots have fled Iceland for
London, or are lying low, leaving the poor
prime minister to shoulder the blame and
face the angry demonstrators, led by
folksinging activist Hördur Torfason, who
assemble every weekend outside Parliament.
Haarde has his story, and he’s sticking to
it: foreigners entrusted their capital to Ice-
land, and Iceland put it to good use, but
then, on September 15, 2008, Lehman
Brothers failed and foreigners panicked and

demanded their capital back. Iceland was
ruined not by its own recklessness but by a
global tsunami. The problem with this story
is that it fails to explain why the tsunami
struck Iceland, as opposed to, say, Tonga.
But I didn’t come to Iceland to argue. I
came to understand. “There’s something I
really want to ask you,” I say.
“Yes?”
“Is it true that you’ve been telling people
that it’s time to stop banking and go
fishing?”
A great line, I thought. Succinct, true, and
to the point. But I’d heard about it third-
hand, from a New York hedge fund manager.
The prime minister fixes me with a self-con-
sciously stern gaze. “That’s a gross exaggera-
tion,” he says.
“I thought it made sense,” I say uneasily.
“I never said that!”
Obviously, I’ve hit some kind of nerve, but

have said such a thing would make him seem
a fool? Or does he still think that fishing, as a
profession, is somehow less dignified than
banking?
ATLENGTH,I return to the hotel to find, for the
first time in four nights, no empty cham-
pagne bottles outside my neighbors’ door.
The Icelandic couple whom I had envisioned
as being on one last blowout have packed
and gone home. For four nights I have en-
dured their orc shrieks from the other side of
the hotel wall; now all is silent. It’s possible
to curl up in bed with “The Economic Theory
of a Common-Property Resource: The Fish-
ery.” One way or another, the wealth in Ice-
land comes from the fish, and if you want to
understand what Icelanders did with their
money you had better understand how they
came into it in the first place.
The brilliant paper was written back in
1954 by H. Scott Gordon, an Indiana
University economist. It describes the plight

                     PAGE 78

of the fisherman—and seeks to explain “why
fishermen are not wealthy, despite the fact
that fishery resources of the sea are the
richest and most indestructible available to
man.” The problem is that, because the fish
are everybody’s property, they are nobody’s
property. Anyone can catch as many fish as
he likes, so people fish right up to the point
where fishing becomes unprofitable—for
everybody. “There is in the spirit of every
fisherman the hope of the ‘lucky catch,’”
wrote Gordon. “As those who know fisher-
men well have often testified, they are gam-
blers and incurably optimistic.”
Fishermen, in other words, are a lot like
American investment bankers. Their over-
confidence leads them to impoverish not just
themselves but also their fishing grounds.
Simply limiting the number of fish caught
won’t solve the problem; it will just heighten
the competition for the fish and drive down
profits. The goal isn’t to get fishermen to



==================================================
                     PAGE 79                      
==================================================

overspend on more nets or bigger boats. The
goal is to catch the maximum number of fish
with minimum effort. To attain it, you need
government intervention.
This insight is what led Iceland to go from
being one of the poorest countries in Europe
circa 1900 to being one of the richest circa
2000. Iceland’s bigchange began in theearly
1970s, after a couple of years when the fish
catch was terrible. The best fishermen re-
turned for a second year in a row without
their usual haul of cod and haddock, so the
Icelandic government took radical action:
they privatized the fish. Each fisherman was
assigned a quota, based roughly on his his-
torical catches. If you were a big-time
Icelandic fisherman you got this piece of pa-
per that entitled you to, say, 1 percent of the
total catch allowed to be pulled from Ice-
land’s waters that season. Before each season
the scientists at the Marine Research Insti-
tute would determine the total number of

                     PAGE 80                      
==================================================

80/396
cod or haddock that could be caught without
damaging the long-term health of the fish
population; from year to year, the numbers
of fish you could catch changed. But your
percentage of the annual haul was fixed, and
this piece of paper entitled you to it in
perpetuity.
Even better, if you didn’t want to fish you
could sell your quota to someone who did.
The quotas thus drifted into the hands of the
people to whom they were of the greatest
value, the best fishermen, who could extract
the fish from the sea with maximum effi-
ciency. You could also take your quota to the
bank and borrow against it, and the bank
had no trouble assigning a dollar value to
your share of the cod pulled, without com-
petition, from the richest cod-fishing
grounds on earth. The fish had not only been
privatized, they had been securitized.
ITWASHORRIBLY unfair: a public resource—all
the fish in the Icelandic sea—was simply

turned over to a handful of lucky Icelanders.
Overnight, Iceland had its first billionaires,
and they were all fishermen. But as social
policy it was ingenious: in a single stroke the
fish became a source of real, sustainable
wealth rather than shaky sustenance. Fewer
people were spending less effort catching
more or less precisely the right number of
fish to maximize the long-term value of Ice-
land’s fishing grounds. The new wealth
transformed Iceland—and turned it from the
backwater it had been for 1,100 years to the
place that spawned Björk. If Iceland has be-
come famous for its musicians it’s because
Icelanders now have time to play music, and
much else. Iceland’s youth are paid to study
abroad, for instance, and encouraged to cul-
tivate themselves in all sorts of interesting
ways. Since its fishing policy transformed
Iceland, the place has become, in effect, a
machine for turning cod into PhDs.

==================================================

But this, of course, creates a new problem:
people with PhDs don’t want to fish for a liv-
ing. They need something else to do.
And that something is probably not work-
ing in the industry that exploits Iceland’s
othermainnaturalresource:energy.Thewa-
terfalls and boiling lava generate vast
amounts of cheap power, but, unlike oil, it
cannot be profitably exported. Iceland’s
power is trapped in Iceland, and if there is
something poetic about the idea of trapped
power, there is also something prosaic in
how the Icelanders have come to terms with
the problem. They asked themselves: What
can we do that other people will pay money
for that requires huge amounts of power?
The answer was: smelt aluminum.
Notice that no one asked, What might
Icelanders want to do? Or even: What might
Icelanders be especially suited to do? No one
thought that Icelanders might have some
natural gift for smelting aluminum, and, if

anything, the opposite proved true. Alcoa,
the biggest aluminum company in the coun-
try, encountered two problems peculiar to
Iceland when, in 2004, it set about erecting
its giant smelting plant. The first was the so-
called hidden people—or, to put it more
plainly, elves—in whom some large number
of Icelanders, steeped long and thoroughly in
their rich folkloric culture, sincerely believe.
Before Alcoa could build its smelter it had to
defer to a government expert to scour the en-
closed plant site and certify that no elves
were on or under it. It was a delicate corpor-
ate situation, an Alcoa spokesman told me,
because they had to pay hard cash to declare
thesiteelf-free,but,asheputit,“wecouldn’t
as a company be in a position of acknow-
ledging the existence of hidden people.” The
other, more serious problem was the
Icelandic male: he took more safety risks
than aluminum workers in other nations did.
“In manufacturing,” says the Alcoa

spokesman, “you want people who follow the
rules and fall in line. You don’t want them to
be heroes. You don’t want them to try to fix
something it’s not their job to fix, because
they might blow up the place.” The Icelandic
male had a propensity to try to fix something
it wasn’t his job to fix.
Back away from the Icelandic economy and
you can’t help but notice something really
strange about it: the people have cultivated
themselves to the point where they are un-
suited for the work available to them. All
these exquisitely schooled, sophisticated
people, each and every one of whom feels
special, are presented with two mainly hor-
rible ways to earn a living: trawler fishing
and aluminum smelting. There are, of
course,afewjobsinIcelandthatanyrefined,
educated person might like to do. Certifying

will take at least six months—it can be very
tricky.”) But not nearly so many as the place

needs, given its talent for turning cod into
PhDs. At the dawn of the twenty-first cen-
tury, Icelanders were still waiting for some
task more suited to their filigreed minds to
turn up inside their economy so they might
do it.
Enter investment banking.
FOR THE FIFTH time in as many days I note a
slight tension at any table where Icelandic
men and Icelandic women are both present.
The male exhibits the global male tendency
not to talk to the females—or, rather, not to
include them in the conversation—unless
there is some obvious sexual motive. But
that’s not the problem, exactly. Watching
Icelandic men and women together is like
watching toddlers. They don’t play together
but in parallel; they overlap even less organ-
ically than men and women in other de-
veloped countries, which is really saying
something. It isn’t that the women are op-
pressed, exactly. On paper, by historical

global standards, they have it about as good
as women anywhere: good public health
care, high participation in the workforce,
equal rights. What Icelandic women appear
to lack—at least to a tourist who has watched
them for all of ten days—is a genuine con-
nection to Icelandic men. The Independence
Party is mostly male; the Social Democrats,
mostly female. (On February 1, 2009, when
the reviled Geir Haarde finally stepped aside,
hewasreplacedbyJohannaSigurdardottir,a
Social Democrat, and Iceland got not just a
female prime minister but the modern
world’s first openly gay head of state—she is
married to another woman.) Everyone
knows everyone else, but when I ask
Icelanders forleads,themenalwaysreferme
to other men, and the women to other wo-
men. It was a man, for instance, who sugges-
ted I speak to Stefan Alfsson.

looks more like a trawler captain than a fin-
ancier. He went to sea at sixteen and, in the
off-season, to school to study fishing. He was
made captain of an Icelandic fishing trawler
at the shockingly young age of twenty-three
and was regarded, I learned from other men,
as something of a fishing prodigy—which is
to say he had a gift for catching his quota of
cod and haddock in the least amount of time.
And yet, in January 2005, at thirty, he up
and quit fishing to join the currency-trading
department of Landsbanki. He speculated in
the financial markets for nearly two years,
until the great bloodbath of October 2008,
when he was sacked, along with every other
Icelander who called himself a “trader.” His
job, he says, was to sell people, mainly his
fellow fishermen, on what he took to be a
can’t-miss speculation: borrow yen at 3 per-
cent, use them to buy Icelandic kronur, and
then invest those kronur at 16 percent. “I
think it is easier to take someone in the

fishing industry and teach him about cur-
rency trading,” he says, “than to take
someone from the banking industry and
teach them how to fish.”
He then explained why fishing wasn’t as
simple as I thought. It’s risky, for a start, es-
pecially as practiced by the Icelandic male.
“You don’t want to have some sissy boys on
your crew,” he says, especially as Icelandic
captains are famously manic in their fishing
styles. “I had a crew of Russians once,” he
says, “and it wasn’t that they were lazy, but
the Russians are always at the same pace.”
When a storm struck, the Russians would
stop fishing, because it was too dangerous.
“The Icelanders would fish in all conditions,”
saysStefan,“fishuntilitisimpossibletofish.
They like to take the risks. If you go over-
board, the probabilities are not in your favor.
I’m thirty-three, and I already have two
friends who have died at sea.”

It took years of training for him to become
a captain, and even then it happened only by
a stroke of luck. When he was twenty-three
and a first mate, the captain of his fishing
boat quit. The boat owner went looking for a
replacement and found an older fellow, re-
tired, who was something of an Icelandic
fishing legend, the wonderfully named
Snorri Snorrasson. “I took two trips with this
guy,” Stefan says. “I have never in my life
sleptsolittle,becauseIwassoeagertolearn.
I slept two or three hours a night because I
was sitting beside him, talking to him. I gave
him all the respect in the world—it’s difficult
to describe all he taught me. The reach of the
trawler. The most efficient angle of the net.
How do you act on the sea. If you have a bad
day, what do you do? If you’re fishing at this
depth, what do you do? If it’s not working,
do you move in depth or space? In the end
it’s just so much feel. In this time I learned

infinitely more than I learned in school. Be-
cause how do you learn to fish in school?”
This marvelous training was as fresh in his
mind as if he’d received it yesterday, and the
thought of it makes his eyes mist.
“You spent seven years learning every little
nuance of the fishing trade before you were
granted the gift of learning from this great
captain?” I ask.
“Yes.”
“And even then you had to sit at the feet of
this great master for many months before
you felt as if you knew what you were
doing?”
“Yes.”
“Then why did you think you could become
a banker and speculate in financial markets
without a day of training?”
“That’s a very good question,” he says. He
thinks for a minute. “For the first time this
evening I lack a word.” As I often think I

know exactly what I am doing even when I
don’t, I find myself sympathetic.
“What, exactly, was your job?” I ask, to let
him off the hook, catch and release being the
current humane policy in Iceland.
“I started as a . . .”—now he begins to
laugh—“an adviser to companies on currency
risk hedging. But given my aggressive nature
I went more and more into plain speculative
trading.” Many of his clients were other fish-
ermen, and fishing companies, and they, like
him, had learned that if you don’t take risks
you don’t catch the fish. “The clients were
only interested in ‘hedging’ if it meant mak-
ing money,” he says, and begins to laugh
hysterically.
“Did you evenlikebanking?” I ask.
“I never had any respect for bankers,” he
says,stillgaspingforbreath.“Tothisdayone
of my favorite phrases is: never trust a
banker.”

IN RETROSPECT, THERE are some obvious ques-
tions an Icelander living through the past
five years might have asked himself. For ex-
ample: Why should Iceland suddenly be so
seemingly essential to global finance? Or:
Why do giant countries that invented mod-
ern banking suddenly need Icelandic banks
to stand between their depositors and their
borrowers—to decide who gets capital and
who does not? And: If Icelanders have this
incredible natural gift for finance, how did
they keep it so well hidden for 1,100 years?
At the very least, in a place where everyone
knows everyone else or his sister, you might
have thought that the moment Stefan Alfs-
son walked into Landsbanki ten people
would have said, “Stefan, you’re a fisher-
man!” But they didn’t. To a shocking degree,
they still don’t. “If I went back to banking,”
says the Icelandic cod fisherman, now wear-
ing an entirely straight face, “I would be a
private-banking guy.”

BACKIN2001, as the Internet boom turned into
a bust, MIT’s Quarterly Journal of Econom-
ics published an intriguing paper called
“Boys Will Be Boys: Gender, Overconfidence,
and Common Stock Investment.” The au-
thors, Brad Barber and Terrance Odean,
gained access to the trading activity in over
35,000 households, and used it to compare
the habits of men and women. What they
found, in a nutshell, is that men not only
trade more often than women but do so from
a false faith in their own financial judgment.
Single men traded less sensibly than married
men, and married men traded less sensibly
than single women: the less the female pres-
ence, the less rational the approach to trad-
ing in the markets.
One of the distinctive traits about Iceland’s
disaster, and Wall Street’s, is how little wo-
men had to do with it. Women worked in the
banks, but not in the risk-taking jobs. As far
as I can tell, during Iceland’s boom, there

was just one woman in a senior position in-
side an Icelandic bank. Her name is Kristin
Pétursdóttir, and by 2005 she had risen to
become deputy CEO for Kaupthing in Lon-
don. “The financial culture is very male-
dominated,” she says. “The culture is quite
extreme. It is a pool of sharks. Women just
despise the culture.” Pétursdóttir still en-
joyed finance. She just didn’t like the way
Icelandic men did it, and so, in 2006, she
quit her job. “People said I was crazy,” she
says, but she wanted to create a financial ser-
vices business run entirely by women. To
bring, as she puts it, “more feminine values
to the world of finance.”
Today her firm is, among other things, one
of the very few profitable financial busi-
nesses left in Iceland. After the stock ex-
change collapsed, the money flooded in. A
few days before we met, for instance, she
heard banging on the front door early one
morning and opened it to discover a little old

man. “I’m so fed up with this whole system,”
he said. “I just want some women to take
care of my money.”
It was with that in mind that I walked, on
my last afternoon in Iceland, into the Saga
Museum. Its goal is to glorify the Sagas, the
great twelfth- and thirteenth-century
Icelandic proseepics, buttheeffectofitslife-
size dioramas is more like that of modern
reality TV. Not statues carved from silicone
but actual ancient Icelanders, or actors pos-
ing as ancient Icelanders, as shrieks and
bloodcurdling screams issue from the PA
system: a Catholic bishop named Jón Arason
having his head chopped off; a heretic
named Sister Katrin being burned at the
stake; a battle scene in which a blood-
drenched Viking plunges his sword toward
the heart of a prone enemy. The goal was
verisimilitude, and to achieve it no expense
was spared. Passing one tableau of blood and
guts and moving on to the next, I caught

myself glancing over my shoulder to make
sure some Viking wasn’t following me with a
battle-ax. The effect was so disorienting that
when I reached the end and found a Japan-
ese woman immobile and reading on a
bench, I had to poke her on the shoulder to
make sure she was real.
This is the past Icelanders supposedly
cherish: a history of conflict and heroism. Of
seeing who is willing to bump into whom
with the most force. There may be plenty of
women in it, but it is chiefly a history of men.

false prosperity, you import the future into
the present. It isn’t the actual future so much
as some grotesque silicone version of it.
Leverage buys you a glimpse of a prosperity
you haven’t really earned. The striking thing
about the future the Icelandic male briefly
imported was how much it resembled the
past that he celebrates. I’m betting now
they’ve seen their false future the Icelandic

AND THEY
INVENTED MATH
A
fter an hour on a plane, two in a taxi, three
on a decrepit ferry, and then four more on
buses driven madly along the tops of sheer
cliffs by Greeks on cell phones, I rolled up to
the front door of the vast and remote monas-
tery. The spit of land poking into the Aegean
Sea felt like the end of the earth, and just as
silent. It was late afternoon, and the monks
were either praying or napping, but one re-
mained on duty at the guard booth to greet
visitors. He guided me along with seven

Greek pilgrims to an ancient dormitory,
beautifully restored, where two more solicit-
ous monks offered ouzo, pastries, and keys
to cells. I sensed something missing, and
then realized: no one had asked for a credit
card. The monastery was not merely efficient
but free. One of the monks then said the next
event would be the church service: Vespers.
The next event, it will emerge, will almost al-
ways be a church service. There were thirty-
seven different chapels inside the monas-
tery’s walls; finding the service is going to be
like finding Waldo, I thought.
“Which church?” I asked the monk.
“Just follow the monks after they rise,” he
said. Then he looked me up and down more
closely. He wore an impossibly long and wild
black beard, long black robes, a monk’s cap,
and prayer beads. I wore white running
shoes, light khakis, and a mauve Brooks
Brothers shirt and carried a plastic laundry
bag that said EAGLES PALACE HOTEL in giant

letters on the side. “Why have you come?” he
asked.
That was a good question. Not for church; I
was there for money. The tsunami of cheap
credit that rolled across the planet between
2002 and 2007 has just now created a new
opportunity for travel: financial-disaster
tourism. The credit wasn’t just money, it was
temptation. It offered entire societies the
chance to reveal aspects of their characters
they could not normally afford to indulge.
Entire countries were told, “The lights are
out, you can do whatever you want to do and
no one will ever know.” What they wanted to
do with money in the dark varied. Americans
wanted to own homes far larger than they
could afford, and to allow the strong to ex-
ploit the weak. Icelanders wanted to stop
fishing and become investment bankers, and
toallowtheiralphamalestorevealathereto-
fore suppressed megalomania. The Germans
wanted to be even more German; the Irish

wanted tostopbeing Irish. Allthesedifferent
societies were touched by the same event,
but each responded to it in its own peculiar
way. No response was as peculiar as the
Greeks’, however: anyone who had spent
even a few days talking to people in charge of
the place could see that. But to see just how
peculiar it was, you had to come to this
monastery.
I had my reasons for being here. But I was
pretty sure that if I told the monk what they
were, he’d throw me out. And so I lied. “They
say this is the holiest place on earth,” I said.
I’d arrived in Athens just a few days earlier,
exactly one week before the next planned ri-
ot, and a few days after German politicians
suggested that the Greek government, to pay
off its debts, should sell its islands and per-
haps throw some ancient ruins into the bar-
gain. Greece’s new socialist prime minister,
George Papandreou, had felt compelled to
deny that he was actually thinking of selling

any islands. Moody’s, the rating agency, had
just lowered Greece’s credit rating to the
level that turned all Greek government
bonds into junk—and so no longer eligible to
be owned by many of the investors who
owned them. The resulting dumping of
Greek bonds onto the market was, in the
short term, no big deal, because the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund and the European
Central Bank had between them agreed to
lend Greece—a nation of about eleven mil-
lion people, or two million fewer than Great-
er Los Angeles—up to $145 billion. In the
short term Greece had been removed from
the free financial markets and become a
ward of other states.
That was the good news. The long-term
picture was far bleaker. In addition to its
roughly $400 billion (and growing) of out-
standing government debt, the Greek num-
ber crunchers had just figured out that their
government owed another $800 billion or

more in pensions. Add it all up and you got
about $1.2 trillion, or more than a quarter-
million dollars for every working Greek.
Against $1.2 trillion in debts, a $145 billion
bailout was clearly more of a gesture than a
solution. And those were just the official
numbers; the truth is surely worse. “Our
people went in and couldn’t believe what
they found,” a senior IMF official told me,
not long after he’d returned from the IMF’s
first Greek mission. “The way they were
keeping track of their finances—they knew
how much they had agreed to spend, but no
one was keeping track of what he had actu-
ally spent. It wasn’t even what you would call
an emerging economy. It was a third world
country.”
Asitturned out,whattheGreeks wanted to
do, once the lights went out and they were
alone in the dark with a pile of borrowed
money, was turn their government into a
piñata stuffed with fantastic sums and give

as many citizens as possible a whack at it. In
just the past twelve years the wage bill of the
Greek public sector has doubled, in real
terms—and that number doesn’t take into
account the bribes collected by public offi-
cials. The average government job pays al-
most three times the average private-sector
job. The national railroad has annual reven-
ues of 100 million euros against an annual
wage bill of 400 million, plus 300 million
euros in other expenses. The average state
railroad employee earns 65,000 eurosayear.
Twenty years ago a successful businessman
turned minister of finance named Stefanos
Manos pointed out that it would be cheaper
to put all Greece’s rail passengers into tax-
icabs: it’s still true. “We have a railroad com-
pany which is bankrupt beyond comprehen-
sion,” Manos put it to me. “And yet there
isn’t a single private company in Greece with
that kind of average pay.” The Greek public-
school system is the site of breathtaking

inefficiency: one of the lowest-ranked sys-
tems in Europe, it nonetheless employs four
times as many teachers per pupil as the
highest-ranked, Finland’s. Greeks who send
their children to public schools simply as-
sume that they will need to hire private tu-
tors to make sure they actually learn
something. There are three government-
owned defense companies: together they
have billions of euros in debts, and mounting
losses. The retirement age for Greek jobs
classified as “arduous” is as early as fifty-five
for men and fifty for women. As this is also
the moment when the state begins to shovel
out generous pensions, more than six hun-
dred Greek professions somehow managed
to get themselves classified as arduous:
hairdressers, radio announcers, waiters, mu-
sicians, and on and on and on. The Greek
public health-care system spends far more
on supplies than the European average—and
it is not uncommon, several Greeks tell me,

to see nurses and doctors leaving the job
with their arms filled with paper towels and
diapers and whatever else they can plunder
from the supply closets.
Where waste ends and theft begins almost
doesn’t matter; the one masks and thus en-
ables the other. It’s simply assumed, for in-
stance, that anyone who is working for the
government is meant to be bribed. People
who go to public health clinics assume they
will need to bribe doctors to actually take
care of them. Government ministers who
have spent their lives in public service
emerge from office able to afford multi-
million-dollar mansions and two or three
country homes.
Oddly enough, the financiers in Greece re-
main more or less beyond reproach. They
never ceased to be anything but sleepy old
commercial bankers. Virtually alone among
Europe’s bankers, they did not buy U.S.
subprime-backed bonds, or leverage

themselves to the hilt, or pay themselves
huge sums of money. The biggest problem
the banks had was that they had lent roughly
30 billion euros to the Greek govern-
ment—where it was stolen or squandered. In
Greece the banks didn’t sink the country.
The country sank the banks.
THE MORNING AFTER I landed I walked over to
see the Greek minister of finance, George Pa-
paconstantinou, whose job it is to sort out
this fantastic mess. Athens somehow man-
ages to be bright white and grubby at the
same time. The most beautiful freshly
painted neoclassical homes are defaced with
new graffiti. Ancient ruins are everywhere, of
course, but seem to have little to do with
anything else. It’s Los Angeles with a past.
At the dark and narrow entrance to the
Ministry of Finance a small crowd of security
guards screen you as you enter—then don’t
bother to check and see why you set off the
metal detector. In the minister’s

antechamber six women, all on their feet, ar-
range his schedule. They seem frantic and
harried and overworked . . . and yet he still
runs late. The place generally seems as if
even its better days weren’t so great. The fur-
niture is worn, the floor linoleum. The most
striking thing about it is how many people it
employs. Minister Papaconstantinou (“It’s
okay to just call me George”) attended NYU
and the London School of Economics in the
1980s, then spent ten years working in Paris
for the OECD (Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development). He’s open,
friendly, fresh-faced, and clean-shaven, and
like many people at the top of the new Greek
government, he comes across less as Greek
than as Anglo—indeed, almost American.
When Papaconstantinou arrived here, in
October2009,theGreekgovernment hades-
timated its 2009 budget deficit at 3.7 per-
cent. Two weeks later that number was re-
vised upward, to 12.5 percent, and actually

turned out to be nearly 14 percent. He was
the man whose job it had been to figure out
and explain to the world why. “The second
day on the job I had to call a meeting to look
at the budget,” he says. “I gathered everyone
from the general accounting office, and we
started, like, this discovery process.” Each
day they discovered some incredible omis-
sion.Apensiondebtofabilliondollarsevery

ment’s books, where everyone pretended it
did not exist, even though the government
paid it; the hole in the pension plan for the
self-employed was not the 300 million euros
they had assumed but 1.1 billion euros; and
so on. “At the end of each day I would say,
‘Okay, guys, is this all?’ And they would say,
‘Yeah.’ The next morning there would be this
little hand rising in the back of the room:
‘Actually, Minister, there’s this other one-

This went on for a week. Among other
things turned up were a great number of off-
the-books phony job-creation programs.

off-the-books unit employing 270 people to
digitize the photographs of Greek public
lands,” the finance minister tells me. “The
trouble was that none of the 270 people had
any experience with digital photography. The
actual professions of these people were, like,
hairdressers.”
By the final day of discovery, after the last
little hand had gone up in the back of the
room, a projected deficit of roughly 7 billion
euros was actually more than 30 billion. The
natural question—How is this possible?—is
easily answered: until that moment, no one
had bothered to count it all up. “We had no
Congressional Budget Office,” explains the
finance minister. “There was no independent
statistical service.” The party in power

simply gins up whatever numbers it likes, for
its own purposes.
Once the finance minister had the number,
he went off to his regularly scheduled
monthly meetings with ministers of finance
from all the European countries. As the new
guy, he was given the floor. “When I told
them the number, there were gasps,” he said.
“How could this happen? I was like, You
guys should have picked up that the number
wasn’t right. But the problem was I sat be-
hind a sign that said GREECE, not a sign that
said THE NEW GREEK GOVERNMENT.”After the
meeting the Dutch guy came up to him and
said, “George, we know it’s not your fault,
but shouldn’t someone go to jail?”

stresses that this isn’t a simple matter of the
government lying about its expenditures.
“This wasn’t all due to misreporting,” he
says. “In 2009, tax collection disintegrated,
because it was an election year.”

“What?”
He smiles.
“The first thing a government does in an
election year is to pull the tax collectors off
the streets.”
“You’re kidding.”
Now he’s laughing at me. I’m clearly naïve.
THE COSTS OF running the Greek government
are only half the failed equation: there’s also
the matter of government revenues. The ed-
itor of one of Greece’s big newspapers had
mentioned to me in passing that his report-
ers had cultivated sources inside the coun-
try’s revenue service. They’d done this not so
much to expose tax fraud—which was so
common in Greece that it wasn’t worth writ-
ing about—but to find drug lords, human
smugglers, and other, darker sorts. A hand-
ful of the tax collectors, however, were out-
raged by the systematic corruption of their
business;itfurtheremergedthattwoofthem
were willing to meet with me. The problem

was that, for reasons neither wished to dis-
cuss, they couldn’t stand the sight of each
other. This, I’d be told many times by other
Greeks, was very Greek.
TheeveningafterImetwiththeministerof
finance, I had coffee with one tax collector at
one hotel, then walked down the street and
had a beer with another tax collector at an-
other hotel. Both had already suffered demo-
tions, after their attempts to blow the whistle
on colleagues who had accepted big bribes to
sign off on fraudulent tax returns. Both had
been removed from high-status fieldwork to
low-status work in the back office, where
they could no longer witness tax crimes.
Each was a tiny bit uncomfortable; neither
wanted anyone to know he had talked to me,
as they feared losing their jobs in the tax
agency. And so let’s call them Tax Collector
No. 1 and Tax Collector No. 2.
Tax Collector No. 1—early sixties, business
suit, tightly wound but not obviously

nervous—arrived with a notebook filled with
ideas for fixing the Greek tax-collection
agency. He just took it for granted that I
knew that the only Greeks who paid their
taxes were the ones who could not avoid do-
ing so—the salaried employees of corpora-
tions, who had their taxes withheld from
their paychecks. The vast economy of self-
employed workers—everyone from doctors
to the guys who ran the kiosks that sold the
International Herald Tribune—cheated (one
big reason why Greece has the highest per-
centage of self-employed workers of any
European country). “It’s become a cultural
trait,” he said. “The Greek people never
learned to pay their taxes. And they never
did because no one is punished. No one has
ever been punished. It’s a cavalier of-
fense—like a gentleman not opening a door
for a lady.”
The scale of Greek tax cheating was at least
as incredible as its scope: an estimated two-

thirds ofGreek doctors reported incomes un-
der 12,000 euros a year—which meant, be-
cause incomes below that amount weren’t
taxable, that even plastic surgeons making
millions a year paid no tax at all. The prob-
lem wasn’t the law—there was a law on the
books that made it a jailable offense to cheat
the government out of more than 150,000
euros—but its enforcement. “If the law was
enforced,” the tax collector said, “every doc-
torinGreecewouldbeinjail.”Ilaughed,and
he gave me a stare. “I am completely seri-
ous.” One reason no one is ever prosec-
uted—apart from the fact that prosecution
would seem arbitrary, as everyone is doing
it—is that the Greek courts take up to fifteen
years to resolve tax cases. “The one who does
not want to pay, and who gets caught, just
goes to court,” he says. Somewhere between

with an average of about 18 percent in the
rest of Europe.
The easiest way to cheat on one’s taxes was
to insist on being paid in cash, and fail to
provide a receipt for services. The easiest
way to launder cash was to buy real estate.
Conveniently for the black market—and
alone among European countries—Greece
has no working national land registry. “You
have to know where the guy bought the
land—the address—to trace it back to him,”
says the collector. “And even then it’s all
handwritten and hard to decipher.” But, I
say, if some plastic surgeon takes a million in
cash, buys a plot on a Greek island, and
builds himself a villa, there would be other
records—say, building permits. “The people
who give the building permits don’t inform
the Treasury,” says the tax collector. In the
apparently not-so-rare cases where the tax

course, laws against tax collectors accepting
bribes,explained thecollector,“butifyouget
caught, it can take seven or eight years to get
prosecuted. So in practice no one bothers.”
The systematic lying about one’s income
had led the Greek government to rely in-
creasingly on taxes harder to evade: real es-
tate and sales taxes. Real estate is taxed by
formula—to take the tax collectors out of the
equation—which generates a so-called ob-
jective value for each home. The boom in the
Greek economy over the last decade caused
the actual prices at which property changed
hands to far outstrip the computer-driven
appraisals. Given higher actual sales prices,
the formula is meant to ratchet upward. The
typical Greek citizen responded to the prob-
lem by not reporting the price at which the
sale took place but instead reporting a phony
price—which usually happened to be the
same low number at which the dated for-
mulahadappraised it.Ifthebuyertookouta

loan to buy the house, he took out a loan for
the objective value and paid the difference in
cash, or with a black-market loan. As a result
the “objective values” grotesquely understate
the actual land values. Astonishingly, it’s
widely believed that all three hundred mem-
bers of the Greek parliament declare the real
value of their houses to be the computer-
generated objective value. Or, as both the tax
collectorandalocalrealestateagentputitto
me, “every single member of the Greek par-
liament is lying to evade taxes.”
On he went, describing a system that was,
in its way, a thing of beauty. It mimicked the
tax-collecting systems of an advanced eco-
nomy—and employed a huge number of tax
collectors—while it was in fact rigged to en-
able an entire society to cheat on their taxes.
As he rose to leave, he pointed out that the
waitress at the swanky tourist hotel failed to
provide us with a receipt for our coffees.

“There’s a reason for that,” he said. “Even
this hotel doesn’t pay the sales tax it owes.”
I walked down the street and found waiting
for me, in the bar of another swanky tourist
hotel, the second tax collector. Tax Collector
No. 2—casual in manner and dress, beer-
drinking, but terrified that others might dis-
coverhehadspokentome—alsoarrivedwith
a binder full of papers, only his was stuffed
with real-world examples not of Greek
people but Greek companies that had
cheated on their taxes. He then started to
rattle off examples (“only the ones I person-
ally witnessed”). The first was an Athenian
construction company that had built seven
giant apartment buildings and sold off nearly
a thousand condominiums in the heart of the
city. Its corporate tax bill honestly computed
came to 15 million euros, but the company
had paid nothing at all. Zero. To evade taxes
it had done several things. First, it never de-
clared itself a corporation; second, it

employed one of the dozens of companies
that do nothing but create fraudulent re-
ceipts for expenses never incurred and then,
when the tax collector stumbled upon the
situation, offered him a bribe. The tax col-
lector blew the whistle and referred the case
to his bosses—whereupon he found himself
being tailed by a private investigator, and his
phones tapped. In the end the case was re-
solved, with the construction company pay-
ing 2,000 euros. “After that I was taken off
all tax investigations,” said the tax collector,
“because I was good at it.”
He returned to his thick binder full of
cases. He turned the page. Every page in his
binder held a story similar to the one he had
just told me, and he intended to tell me all of
them. That’s when I stopped him. I realized
that if I let him go on we’d be there all night.
The extent of the cheating—the amount of
energy that went into it—was breathtaking.
In Athens, I several times had a feeling new

to me as a journalist: a complete lack of in-
terest in what was obviously shocking mater-
ial. I’d sit down with someone who knew the
inner workings of the Greek government: a
big-time banker, a tax collector, a deputy fin-
ance minister, a former MP. I’d take out my
notepad and start writing down the stories
that spilled out of them. Scandal after scan-
dal poured forth. Twenty minutes into it I’d
lose interest. There were simply too many:
they could fill libraries, never mind a book.
The Greek state was not just corrupt but
also corrupting. Once you saw how it worked
you could understand a phenomenon that
otherwise made no sense at all: the difficulty
Greek people have saying a kind word about
one another. Individual Greeks are delight-
ful: funny, warm, smart, and good company.
I left two dozen interviews saying to myself,
“What great people!” They do not share the
sentiment about one another: the hardest
thing to do in Greece is to get one Greek to

compliment another behind his back. No
success of any kind is regarded without sus-
picion. Everyone is pretty sure everyone is
cheating on his taxes, or bribing politicians,
or taking bribes, or lying about the value of
his real estate. And this total absence of faith
in one another is self-reinforcing. The epi-
demic of lying and cheating and stealing
makes any sort of civic life impossible; the
collapse of civic life only encourages more ly-
ing, cheating, and stealing. Lacking faith in
one another, they fall back on themselves
and their families.
The structure of the Greek economy is col-
lectivist, but the country, in spirit, is the op-
posite of a collective. Its real structure is
every man for himself. Into this system in-
vestors had poured hundreds of billions of
dollars. And the credit boom had pushed the
country over the edge, into total moral
collapse.

KNOWING NOTHING ELSE about the Vatopaidi
monastery except that, in a perfectly corrupt
society, it had somehow been identified as
the soul of corruption, I made my way up to
the north of Greece, in search of a bunch of
monks who had found new, improved ways
to work the Greek economy. The first stage
was fairly easy: the plane to Greece’s second
city of Thessaloníki, the car being driven
along narrow roads at nerve-racking speeds,
and a night with a lot of Bulgarian tourists at
a surprisingly delightful hotel in the middle
of nowhere called the Eagles Palace. There
thesinglemosthelpfulhotelemployee Ihave
ever met (ask for Olga) handed me a stack of
books and said wistfully how lucky I was to
beable tovisit the place. The Vatopaidi mon-
astery, along with nineteen others, was built
in the tenth century on a thirty-seven-mile-
long-by-six-mile-wide peninsula in northeast
Greece called Mount Athos. Mount Athos
now is severed from the mainland by a long

fence, and so the only way onto it is by boat,
which gives the peninsula the flavor of an is-
land. Onto this island no women are al-
lowed—no female animals of any kind, in
fact, except for cats. The official history
ascribes the ban to the desire of the church
to honor the Virgin; the unofficial one to the
problem of monks hitting on female visitors.
The ban has stood for one thousand years.
This explains the high-pitched shrieks the
next morning, as the ancient ferry packed
withmonksandpilgrims pullsawayfromthe
docks. Dozens of women gather there to
holler at the top of their lungs, but with such
good cheer that it is unclear whether they are
lamenting or celebrating the fact that they
cannot accompany their men. Olga has told
me that she was pretty sure I was going to
need to hike some part of the way to Vato-
paidi, and that the people she has seen off to
the holy mountain don’t usually carry with
them anything so redolent of the modern

material world as a wheelie bag. As a result,
all I have is an Eagles Palace plastic laundry
bag with spare underwear, a toothbrush, and
a bottle of Ambien.
The ferry chugs for three hours along a
rocky, wooded, but otherwise barren coast-
line, stopping along the way to drop monks
and pilgrims and guest workers at other
monasteries. The sight of the first one just
takes my breath away. It’s not a building but
a spectacle: it’s as if someone had taken Ass-
isi or Todi or one of the other old central
Italian hill towns and plopped it down on the
beach, in the middle of nowhere. Unless you
know what to expect on Mount Athos—it has
been regarded by the Eastern Orthodox
Church for more than a millennium as the
holiest place on earth, and it enjoyed for
much of that time a symbiotic relationship
with Byzantine emperors—these places come
as a shock. There’s nothing modest about
them; they are grand and complicated and

ornate and obviously in some sortofcompet-
ition with one another. In the old days, pir-
ates routinely plundered them, and you can
see why: it would be almost shameful not to,
for a pirate.
There are many places in the world where
you can get away with not speaking Greek.
Athens is one of them; the Mount Athos
ferryboat is not. I am saved by an English-
speaking young man who, to my untrained
eye, looks like any other monk: long dark
robes, long dark shaggy beard, fog of un-
friendliness which, once penetrated, evapor-
ates. He spots me using a map with thumb-
nail sketches of the monasteries and trying
to determine where the hell I am meant to
get off the boat: he introduces himself. His
name is Cesar; he’s Romanian, the son of a
counterespionage secret policeman in the
nightmarish regime of Nicolae Ceaus¸escu.
Somehow he has retained his sense of hu-
mor, which counts as some kind of miracle.

He explains that if I knew anything about
anything I would know that he was no monk,
merely another Romanian priest on holiday.
He’s traveled from Bucharest, with two
enormous trunks on wheelies, to spend his
summer vacation in one of the monasteries.
Three months living on bread and water with
no women in sight is his idea of a vacation.
The world outside Mount Athos he finds
somehow lacking.
Cesar draws me a little map to use to get to
Vatopaidi and gives me a more general lay of
the land. The mere fact that I don’t have a
beard will expose me as a not terribly holy
man, he explains, if my mauve Brooks Broth-
ersshirtdoesn’tdoitfirst.“Buttheyareused
to having visitors,” he said, “so it shouldn’t
be a problem.” Then he pauses and asks,
“But what is your religion?”
“I don’t have one.”
“But you believe in God?”
“No.”

He thinks this over.
“Then I’m pretty sure they can’t let you in.”
He lets the thought sink in. “On the other
hand, how much worse could it get for you?”
he says, and chuckles.
An hour later I’m walking off the ferry
holding nothing but the Eagles Palace hotel
laundry bag and Cesar’s little map, and he’s
still repeating his own punch line—“How
much worse could it get for you?”—and
laughing more loudly each time.
The monk who meets me at Vatopaidi’s
front gate glances at the laundry bag and
hands me a form to fill in. An hour later,
having pretended to settle into my surpris-
ingly comfortable cell, I’m carried by a river
of bearded monks through the church door.
Fearing that I might be tossed out of the
monastery before I got a sense of the place, I
do what I can to fit in. I follow the monks in-
to their church; I light candles and jam them
into a tiny sandpit; I cross myself

incessantly; I air-kiss the icons. No one
seems to care one way or the other about the
obviously not-Greek guy in the mauve
Brooks Brothers shirt, though right through
the service a fat young monk who looks a bit
like Jack Black glares at me, as if I was neg-
lecting some critical piece of instruction.
Otherwise the experience was sensational,
to be recommended to anyone looking for a
taste of tenth-century life. Beneath titanic
polished golden chandeliers, and surrounded
by freshly cleaned icons, the monks sang; the
monks chanted; the monks vanished behind
screens to utter strange incantations; the
monks shook what sounded like sleigh bells;
the monks floated by waving thuribles, leav-
ing in their wake smoke and the ancient odor
of incense. Every word that was said and
sung and chanted was biblical Greek (it
seemed to have something to do with Jesus
Christ), but I nodded right along anyway. I
stood when they stood, and sat when they

sat: up and down we went like pogo sticks,
for hours. The effect of the whole thing was
heightened by the monks’ magnificently wild
beards. Even when left to nature, beards do
not all grow in the same way. There are
types: the hopelessly porous mass of fuzz;
the Osama bin Laden/Assyrian-king trowel;
the Karl Marx bird’s nest. A surprising num-
ber of the monks resembled the Most Inter-
esting Man in the World from the Dos Equis
commercial. (“His beard alone has experi-
enced more than a lesser man’s entire
body.”)
The Vatopaidi monks have a reputation for
knowing a lot more about you than you ima-
gine they do, and for sensing what they do
not know. A woman who runs one of the big
Greek shipping firms told me over dinner in
Athens that she had found herself seated on
a flight not long ago beside Father Ephraim,
the abbot of Vatopaidi (business class). “It
was a very strange experience,” she said. “He

everything. My marriage. How I felt about
my work. I felt that he completely knew me.”
Inside their church I doubted their
powers—in the middle of a great national
scandaltheyhaveallowedawriter,albeitone
who has not formally announced himself, to
show up, bunk down, and poke around their
monastery without asking the first question.
But coming out of the church I finally get
seized: a roundish monk with a salt-and-
pepper beard and skin the color of a brown
olive corners me. He introduces himself as
Father Arsenios.
For most of the 1980s and 1990s, Greek in-
terest rates had run a full 10 percent higher
than German ones, as Greeks were regarded
as far less likely to repay a loan. There was
no consumer credit in Greece: Greeks didn’t
have credit cards. Greeks didn’t usually have
mortgage loans, either. Of course, Greece
wanted to be treated, by the financial

markets, like a properly functioning North-
ern European country. In the late 1990s they
saw their chance: get rid of their own cur-
rency and adopt the euro. To do this they
needed to meet certain national targets, to
prove that they were capable of good
European citizenship—that they would not,
in the end, run up debts that other countries
in the euro area would be forced to repay. In
particular they needed to show budget defi-
cits under 3 percent of their gross domestic
product, and inflation running at roughly
German levels. In 2000, after a flurry of stat-
istical manipulation, Greece hit the targets.
To lower the budget deficit the Greek gov-
ernment moved all sorts of expenses (pen-
sions, defense expenditures) off the books.
To lower Greek inflation the government did
things like freeze prices for electricity and
water and other government-supplied goods,
and cut taxes on gas, alcohol, and tobacco.
Greek government statisticians did things

like remove (high-priced) tomatoes from the
consumer price index on the day inflation
was measured. “We went to see the guy who
created all these numbers,” a former Wall
Street analyst of European economies told
me. “We could not stop laughing. He ex-
plained how he took out the lemons and put
in the oranges. There was a lot of massaging
of the index.”
Which is to say that even at the time, some
observers noted that Greek numbers never
seemed to add up. A former IMF official
turned economic adviser to former Greek
prime minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis
turned Salomon Brothers analyst named
Miranda Xafa pointed out in 1998 that if you
added up all the Greek budget deficits over
the previous fifteen years they amounted to
only half the Greek debt. That is, the amount
of money the Greek government had bor-
rowed tofund its operations was twice its de-
clared shortfalls. “At Salomon we used to call

[the then head of the Greek National Statist-
ical Service] ‘the Magician,’” says Xafa, “be-
cause of his ability to magically make infla-
tion, the deficit, and the debt disappear.”
In 2001, Greece entered the European
Monetary Union, swapped the drachma for
the euro, and acquired for its debt an impli-
cit European (read German) guarantee.
Greeks could now borrow long-term funds at
roughly the same rate as Germans—not 18
percent but 5 percent. To remain in the euro
zone, they were meant, in theory, to main-
tain budget deficits below 3 percent of GDP;
in practice, all they had to do was cook the
books to show that they were hitting the tar-
gets. Here, in 2001, entered Goldman Sachs,
which engaged in a series of apparently legal
but nonetheless repellent deals designed to
hide the Greek government’s true level of in-
debtedness. For these trades Goldman
Sachs—which, in effect, handed Greece a $1
billion loan—carved out a reported $300

million in fees. The machine that enabled
Greece to borrow and spend at will was ana-
logous to the machine created to launder the
credit of the American subprime borrow-
er—and the role of the American investment
banker in the machine was the same. The in-
vestment bankers also taught the Greek gov-
ernment officials how to securitize future re-
ceipts from the national lottery, highway
tolls, airport landing fees, and even funds
granted to the country by the European
Union. Any future stream of income that
could be identified was sold for cash up front
and spent. As anyone with a brain must have
known, the Greeks would be able to disguise
their true financial state for only as long as

blowing, as basically everyone was in on the
racket.
That changed on October 4, 2009, when
the Greek government turned over. A scan-
dal felled the government of Prime Minister
Kostas Karamanlis and sent him packing,
which perhaps is not surprising. What’s sur-
prising was the nature of the scandal. In late
2008, news broke that Vatopaidi had some-
how acquired a fairly worthless lake and
swapped it for far more valuable
government-owned land. How the monks
did this was unclear—paid some enormous
bribe to some government official, it was as-
sumed. No bribe could be found, however. It
didn’t matter: the furor that followed drove
Greek politics for the next year. The Vato-
paidi scandal registered in Greek public
opinion like nothing in memory. “We’ve nev-
er seen a movement in the polls like we saw
after the scandal broke,” the editor of one of
Greece’s leading newspapers told me.

“Without Vatopaidi, Karamanlis is still the
prime minister, and everything is still going
on as it was before.” Dimitri Contominas, the
billionaire creator of a Greek life-insurance
company and, as it happens, owner of the TV
station that broke the Vatopaidi scandal, put
it to me more bluntly: “The Vatopaidi monks
brought George Papandreou to power.”
After the new party (the supposedly social-
ist Pasok) replaced the old party (the sup-
posedly conservative New Democracy), it
found so much less money in the govern-
ment’scoffersthanithadexpectedthatitde-
cided there was no choice but to come clean.
The prime minister announced that Greece’s
budget deficits had been badly under-
stated—and that it was going to take some
time to nail down the numbers. Pension
funds and global bond funds and other sorts
who buy Greek bonds, having seen several
big American and British banks go belly-up,
and knowing the fragile state of a lot of

European banks, panicked. The new, higher
interest rates Greece was forced to pay left
the country—which needed to borrow vast
sums to fund its operations—more or less
bankrupt. In came the IMF to examine the
Greekbooksmoreclosely;outwentwhatever
tiny shred of credibility the Greeks had left.
“How in the hell is it possible for a member
of the euro area to say the deficit was 3 per-
cent of GDP when it was really 15 percent?” a
senior IMF official asks. “How could you
possibly do something like that?”
Just now the global financial system is con-
sumed with the question of whether the
Greeks will default on their debts. At times it
seems as if it is the only question that mat-
ters, for if Greece walks away from $400 bil-
lion in debt, then the European banks that
lent the money will go down, and other
countries now flirting with bankruptcy
(Spain, Portugal) might easily follow. But
this question of whether Greece will repay its

debts is really a question of whether Greece
will change its culture, and that will happen
only if Greeks want to change. I am told fifty
times if I am told once that what Greeks care
about is “justice,” and what really boils the
Greek blood is the feeling of unfairness. Ob-
viously this distinguishes them from no hu-
man being on the planet, and ignores what’s
interesting: exactly what a Greek finds un-
fair. It’s clearly not the corruption of their
political system. It’s not cheating on their
taxes, or taking small bribes in their service
to the state. No: what bothers them is when
some outside party—someone clearly differ-
ent from themselves, with motives apart
from narrow and easily understood self-in-
terest—comes in and exploits the corruption
of their system. Enter the monks.
Among the first moves made by the new
minister of finance was to file a lawsuit
against the Vatopaidi monastery, demanding
the return of government property and

damages. Among the first acts of the new
parliament was to open a second investiga-
tion of the Vatopaidi affair, to finally nail
down exactly how the monks got their sweet
deal. The one public official who has been
strung up—he’s had his passport taken away
and remains free only because he posted a
bail of 400,000 euros—is an assistant to the
former prime minister, Giannis Angelou,
who stands accused of helping these monks.
In a society that has endured something
like total moral collapse, its monks had
somehow become the single universally ac-
ceptable target of moral outrage. Every right-
thinking Greek citizen is still furious with
them and those who helped them, and yet no
one knows exactly what they did, or why.
FATHER ARSENIOS LOOKS to be in his late
fifties—though who knows, as their beards
cause them all to look twenty years older.
He’s about as famous as you can get, for a
monk: everyone in Athens knows who he is.

Mr. Inside, the consummate number two,
the CFO, the real brains of the operation. “If
they put Arsenios in charge of the
government real-estate portfolio,” a promin-
ent Greek real estate agent said to me, “this
country would be Dubai. Before the crisis.” If
you are kindly disposed to these monks,
Father Arsenios is the trusted assistant who
makes possible the miraculous abbacy of
Father Ephraim. If you are not, he’s Jeff
Skilling to Ephraim’s Kenneth Lay.
I tell him who I am and what I do—and

viewing political types in Athens. He smiles,
genuinely: he’s pleased I’ve come! “The
politicians all used to come here,” he says,
“but because of our scandal they don’t now.
They are afraid of being seen with us!”
He escorts me into the dining hall and
plants me at what appears to be the pilgrim’s
table of honor, right next to the table filled
with the top monks. Father Ephraim heads

that table, with Arsenios in shouting
distance.
Most of what the monks eat they grow
themselves within a short walk of the dining
hall. Crude silver bowls contain raw, uncut
onions, green beans, cucumbers, tomatoes,
and beets. Another bowl holds bread baked
by the monks, from their own wheat. There’s
a pitcher of water and, for dessert, a soupy
orange sherbet-like substance and dark hon-
eycomb recently plundered from some bee-
hive. And that’s pretty much it. If it were a
restaurant in Berkeley, people would revel in
the glorious self-righteousness of eating the
locally grown; here the food just seems plain.
The monks eat like fashion models before a
shoot. Twice a day four days a week, and
once a day for three: eleven meals, all of
them more or less like this. Which raises an
obvious question: Why are some of them fat?
Most of them—maybe 100 out of the 110 now
in residence—resemble their diet. Beyond

thin: narrow. But a handful, including the
two bosses, have an ampleness to them that
cannot be explained by eleven helpings of
raw onion and cucumber, no matter how
much honeycomb they chew through.
After dinner the monks return to church,
where they will remain chanting and singing
and crossing and spraying incense until one
in the morning. Arsenios grabs me and takes
me for a walk. We pass Byzantine chapels
and climb Byzantine stairs until we arrive at
a door in a long Byzantine hall freshly
painted but otherwise antique: his office. On
the desk are two computers; behind it a
brand-new fax machine-cum-printer; on top
of it a cell phone and a Costco-size tub of vit-
amin C pills. The walls and floor gleam like
new. The cabinets exhibit row upon row of
three-ring binders. The only sign that this
isn’t a business office circa 2010 is a single
icon over the desk. Apart from that, if you
put this office side by side with the office of

Greece’s minister of finance and asked which
one housed the monk, this wouldn’t be it.
“There is more of a spiritual thirst today,”
he says, when I ask him why his monastery
has attracted so many important business
and political people. “Twenty or thirty years
ago they taught that science will solve all
problems. There are so many material things
and they are not satisfying. People have got-
ten tired of material pleasures. Of material
things. And they realize they cannot really
find success in these things.” And with that
he picks up the phone and orders drinks and
dessert. Moments later a silver tray arrives,
bearing pastries and glasses of what appears
to be crème de menthe.
Thus began what became a three-hour en-
counter. I’d ask simple questions—Why on
earth would anyone become a monk? How
do you handle life without women? How do
people who spend ten hours a day in church
find time to create real estate empires?

Where did you get the crème de
menthe?—and he would answer in twenty-
minute-long parables in which there would
be, somewhere, a simple answer. (For ex-
ample: “I believe there are many more beau-
tiful things than sex.”) As he told his stories
he waved and jumped around and smiled
and laughed: if Father Arsenios feels guilty
about anything, he has a rare talent for hid-
ing it. Like a lot of people who come to Vato-
paidi, I suppose, I was less than perfectly
sure what I was after. I wanted to see if it felt
like a front for a commercial empire (it
doesn’t) and if the monks seemed insincere
(hardly). ButIalsowondered howabunchof
odd-looking guys who had walked away from
the material world had such a knack for get-
ting their way in it: How on earth do monks,
of all people, wind up as Greece’s best shot at
a Harvard Business School case study?
After about two hours I work up the nerve
to ask him. To my surprise he takes me

seriously. He points to a sign he has tacked
up on one of his cabinets, and translates it
from the Greek: The smart person accepts.
The idiot insists.
He got it, he says, on one of his business
trips to the Ministry of Tourism. “This is the
secret of success for anywhere in the world,
not just the monastery,” he says, and then
goes on to describe pretty much word for
word the first rule of improvisational com-
edy, or for that matter any successful collab-
orative enterprise. Take whatever is thrown
at you and build upon it. “Yes . . . and” rather
than “No . . . but.” “The idiot is bound by his
pride,” he says. “It always has to be his way.
This is also true of the person who is decept-
ive or doing things wrong: he always tries to
justify himself. A person who is bright in re-
gard to his spiritual life is humble. He ac-
cepts what others tell him—criticism,
ideas—and he works with them.”

I notice now that his windows open upon a
balcony overlooking the Aegean Sea. The
monksarenotpermittedtoswiminit;why,I
never asked. Just like them, though, to build
a beach house and then ban the beach. I no-
tice, also, that I am the only one who has
eaten the pastries and drunk the crème de

failed some sort of test of my ability to
handle temptation.
“Thewholegovernment saystheyareangry
at us,” he says, “but we have nothing. We
work for others. The Greek newspapers, they
call us a corporation. But I ask you, Michael,
what company has lasted for a thousand
years?”
At that moment, out of nowhere, Father
Ephraim walks in. Round, with rosy cheeks
andawhitebeard,heismoreorlessthespit-
ting image of Santa Claus. He even has a
twinkle in his eye. A few months before, he’d
been hauled before the Greek parliament to

testify. One of his interrogators said that the
Greek government had acted with unusual
efficiency when it swapped Vatopaidi’s lake
for the Ministry of Agriculture’s commercial
properties. He asked Ephraim how he had
done it.
“Don’t you believe in miracles?” Ephraim
had said.
“I’m beginning to,” said the Greek MP.
When we are introduced, Ephraim clasps
my hand and holds it for a very long time. It
crosses my mind that he is about to ask me
what I want for Christmas. Instead he says,
“What is your faith?” “Episcopalian,” I cough
out. He nods; he calibrates: it could be
worse; it probably is worse. “You are mar-
ried?” he asks. “Yes.” “You have children?” I
nod; he calibrates: I can work with this. He
asks for their names . . .
THE SECOND PARLIAMENTARY inquiry into the
Vatopaidi affair is still gathering steam, and
you never know what it may turn up. But the

main facts of the case are not in dispute; the
main question left to answer is the motives
of the monks and the public servants who
helped them. In the late 1980s, Vatopaidi
was a complete ruin—a rubble of stones
overrun with rats. The frescoes were black.
The icons went uncared for. The place had a
dozen monks roaming around its ancient
stones, but they were autonomous and disor-
ganized. In church jargon they worshipped
idiorrhythmically—which is another way of
saying that in their quest for spiritual satis-
faction it was every man for himself. No one
was in charge; they had no collective pur-
pose. Their relationship to their monastery,
in other words, was a lot like the relationship
of the Greek citizen to his state.
That changed in the early 1990s, when a
group of energetic young Greek Cypriot
monks from another part of Athos, led by
Father Ephraim, saw a rebuilding opportun-
ity: a fantastic natural asset that had been



==================================================

terribly mismanaged. Ephraim set about
raising the money to restore Vatopaidi to its
former glory. He dunned the European
Union for cultural funds. He mingled with
rich Greek businessmen in need of forgive-
ness. He cultivated friendships with import-
ant Greek politicians. In all of this he exhib-
ited incredible chutzpah. For instance, after
a famous Spanish singer visited and took an
interest in Vatopaidi, he parlayed the in-
terest into an audience with government offi-
cials from Spain. They were told a horrible
injustice had occurred: in the fourteenth
century a band of Catalan mercenaries, upset
with the Byzantine emperor, had sacked
Vatopaidi and caused much damage. The
monastery received $240,000 from the gov-
ernment officials.
Clearly one part of Ephraim’s strategy was
to return Vatopaidi to what it had been for
much of the Byzantine Empire: a monastery
with global reach. This, too, distinguished it

from the country it happened to be inside.
Despite its entry into the European Union,
Greece has remained a closed economy; it’s
impossible to put one finger on the source of
all the country’s troubles, but if you laid a
hand on them, one finger would touch its in-
sularity. All sorts of things that might be
moreefficiently donebyotherpeopletheydo
themselves; all sorts of interactions with oth-
er countries that they might profitably en-
gage in simply do not occur. In the general
picture the Vatopaidi monastery was a stun-
ning exception: it cultivated relations with
theoutside world. Mostfamously, until scan-
dal hit, Prince Charles had visited three sum-
mers in a row, and stayed for a week each
visit.
Relationships with the rich and famous
were essential in Vatopaidi’s pursuit of gov-
ernment grants and reparations for sackings,
but also for the third prong of its new man-
agement’s strategy: real estate. By far the

smartestthingFatherEphraimhaddonewas
go rummaging around in an old tower where
they kept the Byzantine manuscripts, un-
touched for decades. Over the centuries Byz-
antine emperors andotherrulershaddeeded
to Vatopaidi various tracts of land, mainly in
modern-day Greece and Turkey. In the years
before Ephraim arrived, the Greek govern-
ment had clawed back much of this property,
but there remained a title, bestowed in the
fourteenth century by Emperor John V
Palaiologos, to a lake in northern Greece.
By the time Ephraim discovered the deed
to the lake in Vatopaidi’s vaults, it had been
designated a nature preserve by the Greek
government. Then, in 1998, suddenly it
wasn’t:someonehadallowedthedesignation
to lapse. Shortly thereafter, the monks were
granted full title to the lake.
Back in Athens, I tracked down Peter
Doukas, the official inside the Ministry of
Finance first accosted by the Vatopaidi

monks. Doukas now finds himself at the cen-
ter of the two parliamentary investigations,
but he had become, oddly, the one person in
government willing to speak openly about
what had happened. (He was by birth not an
Athenian but a Spartan—but perhaps that’s
another story.) Unlike most of the people in
the Greek government, Doukas wasn’t a lifer
but a guy who had made his fortune in the
private sector, inside and outside of Greece,
and then, in 2004, at the request of the
prime minister, had taken a post in the Fin-
ance Ministry. He was then fifty-two years
old and had spent most of his career as a
banker with Citigroup in New York. He was
tall and blond and loud and blunt and funny.
It was Doukas who was responsible for the
very existence of long-term Greek-govern-
ment debt. Back when interest rates were
low, and no one saw any risk in lending
money to the Greek government, he talked
his superiors into issuing forty- and fifty-

                     PAGE 154

year bonds. Afterwards the Greek newspa-
pers ran headlines attacking him (DOUKAS
MORTGAGESOURCHILDREN'SFUTURE), but it was
a very bright thing to have done. The $18 bil-
lion of long-term bonds now trade at 50
cents on the dollar—which is to say that the
Greek government could buy them back on
the open market. “I created a nine-billion-
dollar trading profit for them,” says Doukas,
laughing. “They should give me a bonus!”
Not long after Doukas began his new job,
two monks showed up unannounced in his
Finance Ministry office. One was Father
Ephraim, of whom Doukas had heard; the
other, unknown to Doukas but clearly the
sharp end of the operation, a fellow named
Father Arsenios. They owned this lake, they
said, and they wanted the Ministry of Fin-
ance to pay them cash for it. “Someone had
given them full title to the lake,” says
Doukas. “What they wanted now was to
monetize it. They came to me and said, ‘Can

                     PAGE 155

you buy us out?’” Before the meeting,
Doukas sensed, they had done a great deal of
homework. “Before they come to you they
know a lot about you—your wife, your par-
ents, the extent of your religious beliefs,” he
said. “The first thing they asked me was if I
wanted them to take my confession.” Doukas
decided that it would be unwise to tell the
monks his secrets. Instead he told them he
would not give them money for their
lake—which he still didn’t see how exactly
they had come to own. “They seemed to
think I had all this money to spend,” says
Doukas. “I said, ‘Listen, contrary to popular
opinion, there is no money in the Finance
Ministry.’ And they said, ‘Okay, if you cannot
buy us out, why can’t you give us some of
your pieces of land?’”
This turned out to be the winning strategy:
exchanging the lake, which generated no
rents, for government-owned properties that
did. Somehow the monks convinced

                     PAGE 156

156/396
government officials that the land around
the lake was worth far more than the 55 mil-
lion euros an independent appraiser later as-
sessed its value as, and then used that higher
valuation to ask for 1 billion euros’ worth of
government property. Doukas declined to
give them any of the roughly 250 billion
euros’ worth controlled by the Ministry of
Finance. (“No fucking way I’m doing that,”
he says he told them.) The monks went to
the source of the next most valuable
land—farmlands and forests controlled by
the Ministry of Agriculture. Doukas recalls,
“I get a call from the minister of agriculture
saying, ‘We’re trading them all this land, but
it’s not enough. Why don’t you throw in
some of your pieces of land, too?’” After
Doukas declined, he received another
call—this one from the prime minister’s of-
fice. Still he said no. Next he receives this
piece of paper saying he’s giving the monks

                     PAGE 157                     
==================================================

157/396
government land, and all he needs to do is
sign it. “I said, ‘Fuck you, I’m not signing it.’”
And he didn’t—at least not in its original
form. But the prime minister’s office pressed
him; the monks, it seemed to Doukas, had
some kind of hold on the prime minister’s
chief of staff. That fellow, Giannis Angelou,
had come to know the monks a few years be-
fore, just after he had been diagnosed with a
life-threatening illness. The monks prayed
for him; he didn’t die, but instead made a
miraculous recovery. He had, however, given
them his confession.
By now Doukas thought of these monks
less as simple con men than as the savviest
businessmen he had ever dealt with. “I told
them they should be running the Ministry of
Finance,” he says. “They didn’t disagree.” In
the end, under pressure from his boss,
Doukas signed two pieces of paper. The first
agreed not to challenge the monks’ owner-
ship of the lake; the second made possible

the land exchange. It did not give the monks
rights to any lands from the Finance Min-
istry, but, by agreeing to accept their lake in-
to the Ministry of Finance’s real estate port-
folio, Doukas enabled their deal with the
minister of agriculture. In exchange for their
lake the monks received seventy-three differ-
ent government properties, including what
had formerly been the gymnastics center for
the 2004 Olympics—which, like much of
what the Greek government built for the
Olympic Games, was now empty and aban-
doned space. And that, Doukas assumed,
was that. “You figure they are holy people,”
he says. “Maybe they want to use it to create
an orphanage.”
What they wanted to create, as it turned
out, was a commercial real estate empire.
They began by persuading the Greek govern-
ment to do something it seldom did: to
rezone a lot of noncommercial property for
commercial purposes. Above and beyond the



==================================================
                     PAGE 159                     
==================================================

159/396
lands they received in their swap—which the
Greek parliament subsequently estimated to
be worth a billion euros—the monks, all by
themselves, were getting 100 percent finan-
cing to buy commercial buildings in Athens
and to develop the properties they had ac-
quired. The former Olympics gymnastics
center was to become a fancy private hospit-
al—with which the monks obviously enjoyed
a certain synergy. Then, with the help of a
Greek banker, the monks drew up plans for
something to be called the Vatopaidi Real
Estate Fund. Investors in the fund would, in
effect, buy the monks out of the properties
given to them by the government. And the
monks would use the money to restore their
monastery to its former glory.
From an ancient deed to a worthless lake
the two monks had spun what the Greek
newspapers were claiming, depending on the
newspaper, to be a fortune of anywhere from
tens of millions to many billions of dollars.

But the truth was that no one knew the full
extent of the monks’ financial holdings; in-
deed, one of the criticisms of the first parlia-
mentary investigation was that it had failed
tolayhandsoneverythingthemonksowned.
On the theory that if you want to know what
richpeoplearereallyworthyouarefarbetter
off asking other rich people—as opposed to,
say, journalists—I polled a random sample of
several rich Greeks who had made their for-
tune in real estate or finance. They put the
monks’ real estate and financial assets at less
than $2 billion but more than $1 billion—up
from zero since the new management took
over. And the business had started with
nothing to sell but forgiveness.
The monks didn’t finish with church until
one in the morning. Normally, Father
Arsenios explained, they would be up and at
it all over again at four. On Sunday they give
themselves a break and start at six. Throw in

gardens, or washing dishes, or manufactur-
ing crème de menthe, and you can see how
one man’s idea of heaven might be another’s
of hell. The bosses of the operation, Fathers
Ephraim and Arsenios, escape this grueling
regime roughly five days a month; otherwise
this is the life they lead. “Most people in
Greece have this image of the abbot as a
hustler,” another monk, named Father Mat-
thew, from Wisconsin, says to me in a mo-
ment of what I take to be candor. “Everyone
in Greece is convinced that the abbot and
Father Arsenios have their secret bank ac-
counts. It’s completely mad if you think
about it. What are they going to do with it?
They don’t take a week off and go to the
Caribbean. The abbot lives in a cell. It’s a
nice cell. But he’s still a monk. And he hates
leaving the monastery.”
The knowledge that I am meant to be back
in the church at six in the morning makes it
more, not less, difficult to sleep, and I’m out

of bed by five. Perfect silence: it’s so rare to
hear nothing that it takes a moment to
identify the absence. Cupolas, chimneys,
towers,andGreekcrossespunctuatethegray
sky. Also a pair of idle giant cranes: the
freezing of the monks’ assets has halted res-
toration of the monastery. At 5:15 come the
first rumblings from inside the church; it
sounds as if someone is moving around the
icon screens, the sweaty backstage prepara-
tions before the show. At 5:30 a monk grabs
a rope and clangs a church bell. Silence again
and then, moments later, from the monk’s
long dormitory, the beep beep beep of elec-
tric alarm clocks. Twenty minutes later
monks, alone orin pairs, stumble outoftheir
dorm rooms and roll down the cobblestones
to their church. It’s like watching a factory
springing to life in a one-industry town. The
only thing missing are the lunch pails.
Three hours later, in the car on the way
back to Athens, my cell phone rings. It’s

Father Matthew. He wants to ask me a favor.
Oh no, I think, they’ve figured out what I’m
up to and he’s calling to place all sorts of re-
strictions on what I write. They had, sort of,
but he didn’t. The minister of finance in-
sisted on checking his quotes, but the monks
just let me run with whatever I had, which is
sort of amazing, given the scope of the law-
suits they face. “We have been reading this
adviser in the American stock market,” says
the monk. “His name is Robert Chapman . . .
” (I’d never heard of him. He turned out to
be the writer of a newsletter about global fin-
ance.) His fellow monks, said Father Mat-
thew, were wondering what I thought of
Robert Chapman. Whether he was worth
listening to . . .
THEDAYBEFORE I left Greece the Greek parlia-
ment debated and voted on a bill to raise the
retirement age, reduce government pen-
sions, and otherwise reduce the spoils of
public-sector life. (“I’m all for reducing the

number of public-sector employees,” an IMF
investigator had said to me. “But how do you
do that if you don’t know how many there
are to start with?”) Prime Minister
Papandreou presented this bill, as he has
presented everything since he discovered the
hole in the books, not as his own idea but as
a nonnegotiable demand of the IMF’s. The
general idea seems tobethatwhile theGreek
people will never listen to any internal call
for sacrifice they might listen to calls from
outside. That is, they no longer really even
want to govern themselves.
Thousands upon thousands of government
employees take to the streets to protest the
bill. Here is Greece’s version of the Tea
Party: tax collectors on the take, public-
school teachers who don’t really teach, well-
paid employees of bankrupt state railroads
whose trains never run on time, state hospit-
al workers bribed to buy overpriced supplies.
Here they are, and here we are: a nation of

people looking for anyone to blame but
themselves. The Greek public-sector employ-
ees assemble themselves into units that re-
semble army platoons. In the middle of each
unit are two or three rows of young men
wielding truncheons disguised as flagpoles.
Ski masks and gas masks dangle from their
beltssothattheycan stillfightafter theinev-
itable tear gas. “The deputy prime minister
has told us that they are looking to have at
least one death,” a prominent former Greek
minister had told me. “They want some
blood.” Two months earlier, on May 5, dur-
ing the first of these protest marches, the
mob offered a glimpse of what it was capable
of. Seeing people working at a branch of the
Marfin Bank, young men hurled Molotov
cocktails inside and tossed gasoline on top of
the flames, barring the exit. Most of the
Marfin Bank’s employees escaped from the
roof, butthefire killed three workers, includ-
ing a young woman four months pregnant.

As they died, Greeks in the streets screamed
at them that it served them right, for having
the audacity to work. The events took place
in full view of the Greek police, and yet the
police made no arrests.
As on other days, the protesters have ef-
fectively shut down the country. The air-
traffic controllers have also gone on strike
and closed the airport. At the port of Piraeus,
the mob prevents cruise-ship passengers
from going ashore and shopping. At the
height of the tourist season the tourist dol-
lars this place so desperately needs are ef-
fectively blocked from getting into the coun-
try. Any private-sector employee who does
not skip work in sympathy is in danger. All
over Athens shops and restaurants close; so,
for that matter, does the Acropolis.
The lead group assembles in the middle of
a wide boulevard a few yards from the
burned and gutted bank branch. That they
burned a bank is, under the circumstances,

incredible. If there were any justice in the
world the Greek bankers would be in the
streets marching to protest the morals of the
ordinary Greek citizen. The Marfin Bank’s
marble stoop has been turned into a sad
shrine: a stack of stuffed animals for the un-
born child, a few pictures of monks, a sign
with a quote from the ancient orator Iso-
crates: “Democracy destroys itself because it
abuses its right to freedom and equality. Be-
cause it teaches its citizens to consider auda-
city as a right, lawlessness as a freedom, ab-
rasive speech as equality, and anarchy as
progress.” At the other end of the street a
phalanx of riot police stand, shields together,
like Spartan warriors. Behind them is the
Parliament building; inside, the debate pre-
sumably rages, though what is being said
and done is a mystery, as the Greek journal-
ists aren’t working, either. The crowd begins
to chant and march toward the vastly out-
numbered police: the police stiffen. It’s one

of those moments when it feels as if anything
might happen. Really, it’s just a question of
which way people jump.
That’s how it feels in the financial markets,
too. The question everyone wants an answer
to is: Will Greece default? There’s a school of
thought that says they have no choice: the
very measures the government imposes to
cut costs and raise revenues will cause what
is left of the productive economy to flee the
country. The taxes are lower in Bulgaria, the
workers more pliable in Romania. But
there’s a second, more interesting, question:
Even if it is technically possible for these
people to repay their debts, live within their
means, and return to good standing inside
the European Union, do they have the inner
resources to do it? Or have they so lost their
ability to feel connected to anything outside
theirsmallworldsthattheywouldratherjust
shed the obligations? On the face of it, de-
faulting on their debts and walking away

would seem a mad act: all Greek banks
would instantly go bankrupt, the country
wouldhavenoability topayforthemanyne-
cessities it imports (oil, forinstance), and the
government would be punished for many
years in the form of much higher interest
rates, if and when it was allowed to borrow
again. But the place does not behave as a col-
lective; it lacks the monks’ instincts. It be-
haves as a collection of atomized particles,
each of which has grown accustomed to pur-
suing its own interest at the expense of the
common good. There’s no question that the
government is resolved to at least try to re-
create Greek civic life. The only question is:
Can such a thing, once lost, ever be re-
created?

IRELAND’S
ORIGINAL SIN
W
hen I flew to Dublin in early November
2010 the Irish government was busy helping
the Irish people come to terms with their
loss. It had been two years since a handful of
Irish politicians and bankers had decided to
guarantee all the debts of the biggest Irish
banks, but the people were only now getting
their minds around what that meant for
them. The numbers were breathtaking. A
single bank, Anglo Irish, which, two years
before, the Irish government claimed was



==================================================
                     PAGE 171

171/396
suffering from a “liquidity problem,” con-
fessed to losses of 34 billion euros. To get a
sense of how “34 billion euros” sounds to
Irish ears, an American thinking in dollars
needs to multiply it by roughly one hundred:
$3.4 trillion. And that was for a single bank.
As the sum total of loans made by Anglo
Irish Bank, most of it to Irish property de-
velopers, was only 72 billion euros, the bank
had lost nearly half of every dollar it
invested.
The two other big Irish banks, Bank of Ire-
land and, especially, Allied Irish Banks
(AIB), remained Ireland’s dirty little secret.
Both older than Ireland itself (the Bank of
Ireland wasfoundedin1783;Allied Irishwas
formed in a merger of three banks founded
in the 1800s), both were now also obviously
bust. The Irish government owned most of
the two ancient banks, but revealed less
about them than they had about Anglo Irish.
As they had lent vast sums not only to Irish

                     PAGE 172

property developers but also to Irish home
buyers, their losses were obviously vast—and
similar in spirit to the losses at the upstart
Anglo Irish. Even in an era when capitalists
went out of their way to destroy capitalism,
theIrishbankershadsetsomekindofrecord
for destruction. Theo Phanos, whose London
hedge fund has interests in Ireland, says that
“Anglo Irish was probably the world’s worst
bank. Even worse than the Icelandic banks.”
IRELAND’S FINANCIAL DISASTER shared some
things in common with Iceland’s. It was cre-
ated by the sort of men who ignore their
wives’ suggestions that maybe they should
stop and ask for directions, for instance. But
while the Icelandic male used foreign money
to conquer foreign places—trophy companies
in Britain, chunks of Scandinavia—the Irish
male used foreign money to conquer Ireland.
Left alone in a dark room with a pile of
money, the Irish decided what they really
wanted to do with it was buy Ireland. From

each other. An Irish economist named Mor-
gan Kelly, whose estimates of Irish bank
losses have been the most prescient, has
made a back-of-the-envelope calculation that
puts the property-related losses of all Irish
banks at roughly 106 billion euros. (Think
$10.6 trillion.) At the rate money flows into
the Irish treasury, Irish bank losses alone
would absorb every penny of Irish taxes for
the next four years.
In recognition of the spectacular losses, the
entire Irish economy has almost dutifully
collapsed. When you fly into Dublin you are
traveling, for the first time in fifteen years,
against the traffic. The Irish are once again
leaving Ireland, alongwithhordesofmigrant
workers. In late 2006 the unemployment
rate stood at a bit more than 4 percent; now
it’s 14 percent, and climbing toward rates not
experienced since the mid-1980s. Just a few
years ago Ireland was able to borrow money
more cheaply than Germany; now, if it can

borrow at all, it will be charged interest rates
6 percent higher than Germany, another
echo of a distant past. The Irish budget defi-
cit—in 2007 the country had a budget sur-
plus—is now 32 percent of its GDP, the
highest by far in the history of the euro zone.
Professional credit analyst firms now judge
Ireland the third most likely country in the
world to default. Not quite as risky for the
global investor as Venezuela, perhaps, but
riskier than Iraq. Distinctly third world, in
any case.
Yet when I arrived, Irish politics had a
frozen-in-time quality. In Iceland, the
business-friendly conservative party had
been quickly tossed out of power, and the
women had booted the alpha males out of
the banks and government. In Greece the
corrupt, business-friendly, every-Greek-for-
himself conservative party was also given the
heave-ho, and the new government is at-
tempting to create a sense of collective

purpose, or at any rate persuade the citizens
to quit cheating on their taxes. (The new
Greek prime minister is not merely upstand-
ing but barely Greek.) Ireland was the first
Europeancountrytowatchitsentirebanking
system fail, and yet its business-friendly con-
servative party, Fianna Fáil (pronounced
“Feena Foil”), remained in office up until
February 2011. There’s no Tea Party move-
ment, no Glenn Beck, no serious protests of
any kind. The only obvious change in the
country’s politics has been the role played by
foreigners. The new bank regulator, an Eng-
lishman, came from Bermuda. The Irish gov-
ernment and Irish banks are crawling with
American investment bankers and Australi-
an management consultants and faceless
Euro-officials, referred to inside the Depart-
ment of Finance simply as “the Germans.”
Walk the streets at night and, through res-
taurant windows, you see important-looking

important-looking papers. In some new and
strange way Dublin was now an occupied
city: Hanoi, circa 1950. “The problem with
Ireland is that you’re not allowed to work
with Irish people anymore,” an Irish prop-
erty developer told me. He was finding it dif-
ficult to escape hundreds of millions of euros
in debt he would never be able to repay.
Ireland’s regress is especially unsettling be-
cause of the questions it raises about Ire-
land’s former progress: even now no one is
quite sure why the Irish did so well for them-
selves in the first place. Between 1845 and
1852 the country experienced the single
greatest loss of population in world history:
in a nation of 8 million, 1.5 million people
left. Another million Irish people starved to
death, or died from the effects of hunger. In-
side of a decade the nation went from being
among the most densely populated in
Europe to one of the least. The founding of
the Irish state in 1922 might have offered

some economic hope—they now had their
own central bank, their own economic
policies—but right up until the end of the
1980s the Irish had failed to do what eco-
nomists expected them to do: catch up with
their neighbors’ standard of living. As re-
cently as the 1980s 1 million Irish people, in
a nation of a mere 3.2 million, lived below
the poverty line.
WHAT HAS OCCURRED in Ireland since then is
without precedent in economic history. By
the start of the new millennium the Irish
poverty rate was under 6 percent, and Ire-
land was the second richest country in the
world, according to the Bank of Ireland. How
did that happen? A bright young Irishman
who got himself hired by Bear Stearns in the
late 1990s and went off to New York or Lon-
don for five years returned feeling poor. For
the better part of the past decade there’s
been quicker money to be made in Irish real
estate than in American investment banking.



==================================================
                     PAGE 178                     
==================================================

178/396
How did that happen? For the first time in
history people and money longed to get into
Ireland rather than out of it. The most dra-
matic case in point are the Poles. The Polish
government keeps no official statistics on the
movement of its workforce, but its Foreign
Ministry guesstimates that, since their ad-
mission to the European Union, a million
Poles have left Poland to work else-
where—and that, at the peak, in 2006, a
quarter of a million of them were in Ireland.
For the United States to achieve a propor-
tionally distortive demographic effect it
would need to hand green cards to 17.5 mil-
lion Mexicans.
HOW DIDANY of this happen? There are many
theories: the elimination of trade barriers,
the decision to grant free public higher edu-
cation, a low corporate tax rate introduced in
the 1980s, which turned Ireland into a tax
haven for foreign corporations. Maybe the
most intriguing was offered by a pair of

179/396
demographers at Harvard, David E. Bloom
and David Canning, in a 2003 paper called
“Contraception and the Celtic Tiger.” Bloom
and Canning argued that a major cause of
the Irish boom was a dramatic increase in
the ratio of working-age to non–working-age
Irishmen, brought about by a crash in the
Irish birthrate. This in turn had been mainly
driven by Ireland’s decision, in 1979, to leg-
alize birth control. That is, there was an in-
verse correlation between a nation’s fidelity
to the Vatican’s edicts and its ability to climb
out of poverty: out of the slow death of the
Irish Catholic Church arose an economic
miracle.
The Harvard demographers admitted their
theory explained only part of what had
happened in Ireland. And at the bottom of
the success of the Irish there remains, even
now, some mystery. “It appeared like a mira-
culous beast materializing in a forest clear-
ing,” writes the preeminent Irish historian R.

F. Foster, “and economists are still not en-
tirely sure why.” Not knowing why they were
so suddenly so successful, the Irish can per-
hapsbeforgivenfornotknowingexactlyhow
successful they were meant to be. They’d
gone from being abnormally poor to being
abnormally rich without pausing to experi-
ence normality. When, in the early 2000s,
the financial markets began to offer virtually
unlimited credit to all comers—when nations
were let into the dark room with the pile of
money, and asked what they would like to do
with it—the Irish were already in a peculiarly
vulnerable state of mind. They’d spent the
better part of a decade under something very
like a magic spell.
A few months after the spell was broken,
the short-term parking lot attendants at
Dublin Airport noticed that their daily take
had fallen. The lot appeared full; they
couldn’t understand it; then they noticed the
cars never changed. They phoned the Dublin

police, who in turn traced the cars to Polish
construction workers, who had bought them
with money borrowed from the big Irish
banks. The migrant workers had ditched the
cars and gone home. A few months later the
Bank of Ireland sent three collectors to Po-
landtoseewhattheycouldgetback,butthey
had no luck. The Poles were untraceable. But
for their cars in the short-term parking lot,
they might never have existed.
MORGAN KELLY IS a professor of economics at
University College Dublin, but he did not,
until recently, view it as his business to think
much about the economy under his nose. He
had written a handful of highly regarded aca-
demic papers on topics regarded as abstruse
evenbyacademiceconomists(“TheEconom-
ic Impact of the Little Ice Age”). “I only
stumbled on this catastrophe by accident,”
he says. “I had never been interested in the
Irisheconomy.TheIrisheconomyistinyand
boring.” Kelly saw house prices rising madly,

and heard young men in Irish finance to
whom he had recently taught economics try
toexplain whytheboomdidn’t troublethem.
And the sight and sound of them troubled
him. “Around the middle of 2006 all these
former students of ours working for the
banks started to appear on TV!” he says.
“They were now all bank economists and
they were nice guys and all that. And they
were all saying the same thing: ‘We’re going
to have a soft landing.’”
The statement struck him as absurd on the
face of it: real estate bubbles never end with
soft landings. A bubble is inflated by nothing
firmer than people’s expectations. The mo-
ment people cease to believe that house
prices will rise forever, they will notice what
a terrible long-term investment real estate
has become, and flee the market, and the
market will crash. It was in the nature of real
estate booms to end with crashes—just as it
was perhaps in Morgan Kelly’s nature to

assume that if his former students were cast
on Irish TV playing the financial experts,
something was amiss. “I just started
Googling things,” he said.
Googling things, Kelly learned that more
than a fifth of the Irish workforce was now
employed building houses. The Irish con-
struction industry had swollen to become
nearly a quarter of Irish GDP—compared to
less than 10 percent or so in a normal eco-
nomy—and Ireland was building half as
many new houses a year as the United King-
dom, which had fifteen times as many people
to house. He learned that since 1994 the av-
erage price for a Dublin home had risen
more than 500 percent. In parts of Dublin
rents had fallen to less than 1 percent of the
purchase price; that is, you could rent a
million-dollar home for less than $833 a
month. The investment returns on Irish land
were ridiculously low: it made no sense for
capital to flow into Ireland to develop more

of it. Irish home prices implied an economic
growth rate that would leave Ireland, in
twenty-five years, three times as rich as the
United States. (“A price/earnings ratio above
Google’s,” as Kelly put it.) Where would this
growth come from? Since 2000, Irish ex-
ports had stalled and the economy had be-
comeconsumedwithbuildinghousesandof-
fices and hotels. “Competitiveness didn’t
matter,” says Kelly. “From now on we were
going to get rich building houses for each
other.”
The endless flow of cheap foreign money
had teased a new trait out of a nation. “We
are sort of a hard, pessimistic people,” says
Kelly. “We don’t look on the bright side.” Yet
since the year 2000 a lot of people had be-
haved as if each day would be sunnier than
the last. The Irish had discovered optimism.
Their real estate boom had the flavor of a
family lie: it was sustainable so long as it
went unquestioned and it went unquestioned



==================================================

==================================================

185/396
so long as it appeared sustainable. After all,
once the value of Irish real estate came un-
tethered from rents, there was no value for it
that couldn’t be justified. The 35 million
euros Irish entrepreneur Denis O’Brien paid
for the impressive manor house on Dublin’s
Shrewsbury Road sounded like a lot until the
real estate developer Sean Dunne’s wife paid
58 million euros for the four-thousand-
square-foot fixer-upper just down the street.
But the minute you compared the rise in
prices to real estate booms elsewhere and at
other times, you reanchored the conversa-
tion; you biffed the narrative. The comparis-
ons that sprung first to Morgan Kelly’s mind
were with the housing bubbles in the Nether-
lands in the 1970s (after natural gas was dis-
covered in Holland) and Finland in the
1980s(afteroilwasfoundoffitscoast),butit
almost didn’t matter which examples he
picked: the mere idea that Ireland was not
sui generis was the panic-making thought.

“There is an iron law of house prices,” he
wrote.“Themorehousepricesriserelativeto
income and rents, the more they will sub-
sequently fall.”
The problem for Kelly, once he had these
thoughts, was what to do with them. “This
isn’t my day job,” he says. “I was working on
medieval population theory.” By the time I
got to him Kelly had angered and alienated
the entire Irish business and political estab-
lishment, but he was himself neither angry
nor alienated, nor even especially public.
He’s not the pundit type. He works in an of-

not exactly self-denying, he’s clearly more
comfortable talking and thinking about sub-
jects other than himself. He spent years in
graduate school, and collected a doctorate
from Yale, and yet somehow retained an al-
most childlike curiosity. “I was in this posi-
tion—sort of being a passenger on this ship,”
he says. “And you see a big iceberg. And so
you go and ask the captain: Is that an
iceberg?”
HIS WARNING TO his ship’s captain took the
form of his first ever newspaper article. Its
bottom line: “It is not implausible that [Irish
real estate] prices could fall—relative to in-
come—by 40 to 50 percent.” At the top of the
market, he guessed, prices might fall by a
staggering 66 percent. He sent his first piece
tothesmall-circulation IrishTimes.“Itwasa
whim,” he says. “I’m not even sure that I be-
lieved what I was saying at the time. My pos-
ition has always been, ‘You can’t predict the
future.’” As it happened, Kelly had predicted

the future, with uncanny accuracy, but to be-
lieve what he was saying you had to accept
that Ireland was not some weird exception in
human financial history. “It had no impact,”
Kelly says. “The response was general
amusement. It was what will these crazy
eggheads come up with next? sort of stuff.”
What the crazy egghead came up with next
was the obvious link between Irish real es-
tate prices and Irish banks. After all, the vast
majority of the construction was being fun-
ded by Irish banks. If the real estate market
collapsed, those banks would be on the hook
for the losses. “I eventually figured out what
was going on,” says Kelly. “The average value
and number of new mortgages peaked in
summer 2006. But lending standards were
clearly falling after this.” The banks contin-
ued to make worse loans, but the people bor-
rowing the money to buy houses were grow-
ing wary. “What was happening,” says Kelly,
“isthatalotofpeopleweregettingcoldfeet.”

The consequences for Irish banks—and the
economy—of the inevitable shift in market
sentiment would be catastrophic. The banks’
losses would lead them to slash their lending
to actually useful businesses. Irish citizens in
hock to their banks would cease to spend.
And, perhaps worst of all, new construction,
on which the entire economy was now
premised, would cease.
Kelly wrote his second newspaper article,
more or less predicting the collapse of the
Irish banks. He pointed out that in the last
decade the Irish banks and economy had
fundamentally changed. In 1997 the Irish
banks were funded entirely by Irish deposits.
By 2005 they were getting most of their
money from abroad. The small German
savers who ultimately supplied the Irish
banks with deposits to re-lend in Ireland
could take their money back with the click of
a computer mouse. Since 2000, lending to
construction and real estate had risen from 8

percent of Irish bank lending (the European
norm) to 28 percent. One hundred billion
euros—or basically the sum total of all Irish
bank deposits—had been handed over to
Irish commercial property developers. By
2007, Irish banks were lending 40 percent
more to property developers alone than they
had to the entire Irish population seven
years earlier. “You probably think that the
fact that Irish banks have given speculators
€100 billion to gamble with, safe in the
knowledge that the taxpayers will cover most
losses, is a cause for concern to the Irish
Central Bank,” Kelly wrote, “but you would
be quite wrong.”
THISTIMEKELLY sent his piece to a newspaper
with a far bigger circulation, the Irish
Independent. The Independent’s editor
wrote back to say he found the article offens-
ive and wouldn’t publish it. Kelly next turned
to the Sunday Business Post, but the editor
just sat on the piece. The journalists were

following the bankers’ lead and conflating a
positive outlook on real estate prices with a
love of country and a commitment to Team
Ireland. (“They’d all use this same phrase,
‘You’re either for us or against us,’” says a
prominent Irish bank analyst in Dublin.)
Kelly finally went back to the Irish Times,
which ran his piece in September 2007.
A brief and, to Kelly’s way of thinking,
pointless controversy ensued. The public re-
lations guy at University College Dublin
called the head of the Department of Eco-
nomics and asked him to find someone to
write a learned attack on Kelly’s piece. (The
department head refused.) A senior execut-
ive at Anglo Irish Bank, Matt Moran, called
to holler at him. “He went on about how ‘the
real estate developers who are borrowing
from us are so incredibly rich they are only
borrowing from us as a favor.’ He wanted to
argue but we ended up having lunch. This is
Ireland, after all.” Kelly also received a flurry

of worried-sounding messages from financial
people in London, but of these he was dis-
missive. “I get the impression there’s this
pool of analysts in the financial markets who
spend all day sending scary e-mails to each
other.” He never found out how much force
his little newspaper piece exerted on the
minds of people who mattered.
It wasn’t until almost exactly one year
later, on September 29, 2008, that Morgan
Kelly became the startled object of popular
interest. The stocks of the three main Irish
banks, Anglo Irish, AIB, and Bank of Ireland,
had fallen by between a fifth and a half in a
single trading session, and a run on Irish
bank deposits had started. The Irish govern-
ment was about to guarantee all the obliga-
tions of the six biggest Irish banks. The most
plausible explanation for all of this was Mor-
gan Kelly’s narrative: that the Irish economy
had become a giant Ponzi scheme, and the
country was effectively bankrupt. But it was

so starkly at odds with the story peddled by
Irish government officials and senior Irish
bankers—that the banks merely had a “li-
quidity” problem and that Anglo Irish was
“fundamentally sound”—that the two could
not be reconciled. The government had a re-
portnewlythrowntogetherbyMerrillLynch,
which declared that “all of the Irish banks
are profitable and well-capitalized.” The dif-
ference between the official line and Kelly’s
was too vast to be split. You believed either
one or the other, and up until September
2008, who was going to believe this guy
holed up in his office wasting his life writing
about the effects of the Little Ice Age on the
English population? “I went on TV,” says
Kelly. “I’ll never do it again.”
KELLY’S COLLEAGUES IN the University College
economics department watched his trans-
formation from serious academic to amusing
crackpot to disturbingly prescient guru with
interest. One was Colm McCarthy, who, in

the Irish recession of the late 1980s, played a
high-profile role in slashing government
spending, and so had experienced the inter-
section of finance and public opinion. In
McCarthy’s view the dominant narrative in-
side the head of the average Irish cit-
izen—and his receptiveness to the story Kelly
was telling—changed at roughly ten o’clock
in the evening on October 2, 2008. On that
night Ireland’s bank regulator, a lifelong
Central Bank bureaucrat in his sixties named
Patrick Neary, came live on national televi-
sion tobeinterviewed. Theinterviewer soun-
ded as if he had just finished reading the col-
lected works of Morgan Kelly. The Irish bank
regulator, for his part, looked as if he had
been dragged from a hole into which he
badly wanted to return. He wore an insecure
little mustache, stammered rote answers to
questions he had not been asked, and ig-
nored the ones he had been asked.

A banking system is an act of faith: it sur-
vives only for as long as people believe it will.
Two weeks earlier the collapse of Lehman
Brothers had cast doubt on banks every-
where. Ireland’s banks had not been man-
aged to withstand doubt; they had been
managed to exploit blind faith. Now the Irish
people finally caught a glimpse of the guy
meant to be safeguarding them: the crazy
uncle had been sprung from the family cel-
lar. Here he was, on their televisions, insist-
ing that the Irish banks’ problems had noth-
ing whatsoever to do with the loans they’d
made . . . when anyone with eyes could see,
in the vacant skyscrapers and empty housing
estates around them, evidence of bank loans
that were not merely bad but insane. “What
happened was that everyone in Ireland had
the idea that somewhere in Ireland there was
alittlewiseoldmanwhowasinchargeofthe
money, and this was the first time they’d
ever seen this little man,” says McCarthy.

“And then they saw him and said, Who the
fuckwasthat???Isthatthefucking guywho
is in charge of the money??? That’s when
everyone panicked.”
ON THE MORNING of the day the Irish govern-
ment planned to unveil a brutal new budget,
I took my seat in the visitors’ gallery of the
Irish parliament. Beside me sat an aide to
Joan Burton, who, as the Labor Party’s fin-
ancial spokesperson, was at the time a fair
bet to become Ireland’s next minister of fin-
ance, the unnatural heir to an unholy mess.
Down on the floor the seats are mostly
empty, but a handful of politicians, Burton
included, discuss what they have been dis-
cussing without intermission for the past two
years: the nation’s financial crisis.
The first thing you notice when you watch
the Irish parliament at work is that the
politicians say everything twice, once in Eng-
lish and once in Gaelic. As there is no one in
Ireland who does not speak English, and a



==================================================
                     PAGE 197                     
==================================================

197/396
vast majority who do not speak Gaelic, this
comes across as a forced gesture that wastes
a great deal of time. I ask several Irish politi-
cians if they speak Gaelic, and all offer the
same uneasy look and hedgy reply: “Enough
to get by.” The politicians in Ireland speak
Gaelic the way the Real Housewives of
Orange County speak French. To ask “Why
bother to speak it at all?” is of course to miss
the point. Everywhere you turn you see both
emulation of the English and a desire, some-
times desperate, for distinction. The Irish in-
sistence ontheir Irishness—their conceit that
they are more devoted to their homeland
than the typical citizen of the world—has an
element of bluster about it, from top to bot-
tom. At the top are the many very rich Irish
people who emit noisy patriotic sounds but
arrange officially to live elsewhere so they
don’t have to pay tax in Ireland; at the bot-
tom, the waves of emigration that define
Irish history. The Irish people and their

country are like lovers whose passion is
heightened by their suspicion that they will
probably wind up leaving each other. Their
loud patriotism is a cargo ship for their
doubt.
ON THIS DAY, in addition to awaiting word on
the budget, the Dáil (pronounced “Doyle”),
as the Irish call their House of Representat-
ives, had before it what should have been a
controversial piece of business: to vote on
whether to call elections to fill its four empty
seats. The ruling party, Fianna Fáil, held a
slim majority of two seats and, because they
are universally believed to have created a fin-
ancial catastrophe, an approval rating of 15
percent. If the elections were held immedi-
ately, they’d have been tossed from
power—in itself a radical idea, as they have
more or less ruled Ireland since its founding
as an independent state, in 1922. Yet they
successfully resisted the call to fill the empty

seats, right up until they were tossed from
power in February 2011.
A bell rings for a vote, and Irish politicians
stream in. A few minutes before the vote, the
doors to their chamber will be closed and
guarded. A politician who is late is a politi-
cian who cannot vote. A glass barrier separ-
ates the visitors’ gallery and the floor: I ask
my tour guide about it. “It’s not to stop
people from throwing things at their govern-
ment,” she says, then goes on to explain.
Some years ago an Irish politician came late,
afterthedoorshadbeenlocked.Heranupto
the visitors’ gallery, jumped down from it in-
to the press gallery, ten feet below, and from
there rappelled down the wall to the floor.
They allowed the vote, but put up the glass
barrier. They disapproved of the loophole,
but rewarded the guy with the wit to exploit
it. This, she claims, is very Irish.
The first to take his seat is Bertie Ahern,
the prime minister from June 1997 until May



==================================================

2008 and Political Perp No. 1. Ahern is
known both for a native shrewdness and for
saying lots of spectacularly dumb-sounding
things that are fun to quote. Tony Blair has
credited him with a kind of genius in how he
brokered the Northern Ireland peace negoti-
ations; on the other hand, seeking to explain
the financial crisis, he actually said,
“Lehman’s was a world investment bank.
They had testicles everywhere.” Ahern spent
his last days in office denying he’d accepted
bribes from property developers, at least in
part because so much of what he did in office
seemed justified only if he were being paid
by property developers to do it. But Bertie
Ahern, too, obviously believed in the miracle
of Irish real estate. After Morgan Kelly pub-
lished his article predicting the collapse of
the Irish banks, for instance, Ahern famously
responded to a question about it by saying,
“Sitting on the sidelines cribbing and moan-
ing is a lost opportunity. I don’t know how

people who engage in that don’t commit
suicide.”
Now Ahern is just another Irish back-
bencher, with a hangdog slouch and a face
mottled by broken capillaries. To fill the
empty hours he’s taken a second job writing
a sports column for the Rupert Murdoch
Sunday tabloid News of the World, which
just might be the least respectable job in
*
global journalism. Ahern’s star, such as it
was, has fallen. When the Irish land boom
flipped from miracle to catastrophe, a lot of
important people’s status, along with per-
haps their sense of themselves, flipped with
it. An Irish stockbroker has told me that
many of the former bankers, some of whom
he counts as clients, “actually physically look
different.” He’d just seen the former CEO of
Allied Irish Banks, Eugene Sheehy, in a res-
taurant, being heckled by other diners. Shee-
hy once had been a smooth, self-possessed
character whose authority was beyond

question. “If you saw the guy now,” says my
stockbroker friend, “you’d buy him a cup o’
tea.”
The Irish real estate bubble was different
from the American version in many ways. It
wasn’t disguised, for a start. It didn’t require
a lot of complicated financial engineering
beyond the understanding of mere mortals.
It also wasn’t as cynical. There aren’t a lot
Irish financiers, or real estate people, who
have emerged with a future. In America the
banks went down but the big shots in them
still got rich; in Ireland the big shots went
down with the banks. Sean Fitzpatrick, a
working-class kid turned banker who built
Anglo Irish Bank more or less from scratch,
is widely viewed as the chief architect of Ire-
land’s misfortune: today he is not merely
bankrupt but unable to show his face in pub-
lic. Mention his name and people with no in-
terest in banking will tell you with disgust
how he disguised millions of euros of loans

made to himself by his own bank. What they
don’t mention is what he did with the
money: invested it in Anglo Irish bonds!
When the bank failed Fitzpatrick was listed
among its creditors, having (in April 2008!)
purchased five million euros of Anglo Irish
subordinated floating rate notes.
The top executives of all three big banks
operated in a similar spirit: they bought
shares in their own companies right up to
the moment of collapse, and continued to
pay dividends, as if they had capital to burn.
Virtually all of the big Irish property de-
velopers who behaved recklessly signed per-
sonal guarantees for their loans. It’s widely
assumed thattheymustbehiding bigpilesof
money somewhere, but the evidence thus far
suggests that they are not. The Irish Property
Council has counted twenty-nine suicides by
property developers since the crash—in a
country where suicide often goes unreported
and undercounted. “I said to all the guys,

‘Always take money off the table.’ Not many
of them took money off the table,” says Der-
mont Desmond, an Irish billionaire who
made his fortune from software in the early
1990s, and so counts as old money.
TheIrishnouveaurichemayhavecreateda
Ponzi scheme, but it was a Ponzi scheme in
which they themselves believed. So, too, for
that matter, did some large number of ordin-
ary Irish citizens who bought houses for
fantastic sums. Ireland’s 87 percent rate of
homeownership is the highest in the world.
There’snosuchthingasanonrecourse mort-
gage in Ireland: the guy who pays too much
for his house is not allowed simply to hand
the keys to the bank and walk away. He’s on
the hook, personally, for whatever he bor-
rowed. Across Ireland people are unable to
extract themselves from their houses or their
bank loans. Irish people will tell you that, be-
cause of their sad history of dispossession,
owning a home is not just a way to avoid

paying rent but a mark of freedom. In their
rush to freedom, the Irish built their own
prisons. And their leaders helped them to do
it.
JUST BEFORE THE closing bell, the two men
who sold the Irish people on the notion that
they were responsible not merely for their
own disastrous financial decisions but also
for the ones made by their banks arrive in
the chamber: Prime Minister Brian Cowen
and Finance Minister Brian Lenihan. Along
with the leader of the opposition, and the
third in command of their own party, both
are children of politicians who died in office:
Irish politics is a family affair. Cowen hap-
pens also to have been the minister of fin-
ance from 2004 until mid-2008, when most
of the bad stuff happened. He is not an obvi-
ous Leader of Men. His movements are sul-
len and lumbering, his face numbed by cor-
pulence, his natural resting expression a look
of confusion. One morning a few weeks

before, he went on national radio sounding,
to well-trained Irish ears, drunk. To my less
trained ones he sounded merely groggy, but
the public is in no mood to cut him a break.
(Four different Irish people told me, on great
authority, that Cowen had faxed Ireland’s
440-billion-euro bank guarantee into the
European Central Bank from a pub.) And the
truth is, if you were to design a human being
to maximize the likelihood that people would
assume he drank too much you’d have a hard
time doing better than the Irish prime minis-
ter. Brian Lenihan, who follows on Cowen’s
bovine heels, comes across, by comparison,
as a decathlete in peak condition.
On this day, incredibly yet predictably, the
Parliament decides not to hold a vote to fill
three of its four empty seats. Then they ad-
journ, and I spend an hour with Joan Bur-
ton. Of the major parties in Ireland, Labor
offers the closest thing to a dissenting opin-
ion and a critique of Irish capitalism. As one

of only eighteen members of the Irish House
of Commons who voted against guaranteeing
the banks’ debts, Burton retains rare credib-
ility. And in an hour of chatting about this
and that she strikes me as straight, bright,
and basically good news. But her role in the
Irish drama is as clear as Morgan Kelly’s:
she’s the shrill mother no one listened to.
She speaks in exclamation points with a
whiny voice that gets on the nerves of every
Irishman—to the point where her voice is
parodied on national radio. Now, when I ask
her what she would do differently from what
the Irish government is doing, even she is
stumped. Like every other Irish politician,
she is at the mercy of forces beyond her con-
trol. The Irish bank debt is now Irish govern-
ment debt, and any suggestion of default will
only raise the cost of borrowing the foreign
money they now can’t live without. “Do you
know that Irish people are now experts on
bonds?” says Burton. “Yes, they now say one

hundred basis points rather than one per-
cent! They have developed a new
vocabulary!”
As the scope of the Irish losses has grown
clearer, private investors have been less and
less willing to leave even overnight deposits
in Irish banks, and completely uninterested
in buying longer-term bank bonds. The
European Central Bank has quietly filled the
void: one of the most closely watched num-
bers in Europe has been the amount the ECB
has loaned to the big Irish banks. In late
2007, with the markets still suspending their
disbelief, the banks had borrowed 6.5 billion
euros. By December of 2008 the number had
jumped to 45 billion. As Burton spoke to me
the number was rising, from around 86 bil-
lion to a fresh high of 97 billion. That is,
from November 2007 to October 2010 the
Irish banks have borrowed 97 billion euros
from the European Central Bank to repay
private creditors. In September 2010 the last

big chunk of money the Irish banks owed to
their bondholders, 26 billion euros, came
due. Once the bondholders were paid off in
full, a window of opportunity for the Irish
government closed. A default of the banks
would now not be a default to private in-
vestors but a bill presented directly to
European governments. This, by the way, is
why there are so many important-looking
foreigners in Dublin dining alone at night.
They’re here to make sure someone gets his
money back.
One measure of how completely the Irish
can’t imagine offending their foreign finan-
cial rulers is how quickly Burton declines to
contemplate such a default. She bears no re-
sponsibility at all for the banks’ private
debts, and yet when we creep up on the pos-
sibility of simply walking away from them,
she veers away. Actually, she ups and leaves.
“Oh, I have to go,” she says. “I have to meet
the finance minister with the bad news.”

Lenihan has called a private meeting with
the opposition so that its leaders will be the
first to hear of the draconian new Irish
budget. This meeting is held not inside the
Parliament, where the media can be kept at
arm’s length, but in a nearby building where
the media are allowed to congregate. “We
tried to have it in here but he moved it out-
side,” says Burton. “He’s taken to bringing us
in to tell us the bad news first, so that when
we walk out we’re the ones announcing it to
the media.” She smiles. “He’s tricky that
way.”
BRIAN LENIHAN IS the last remaining Irish
politician anywhere near power whose mere
appearance does not cause people on the
streets of Dublin to explode with either scorn
or laughter. He came to the job just weeks
before the crisis, and so escapes blame for its
origins. He’s a barrister, not a financial or
real estate person, with a proven ability to
earn a good living without being bribed by

property developers. He comes from a family
of political people who are thought to have
served honorably, or at any rate not used
politicstoenrichthemselves.And,inDecem-
ber 2009, he was diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer. Anyone who has been anywhere near
an Irish Catholic family knows that the
member who has had the most recent run of
bad luck enjoys exalted status—the right to
do pretty much whatever he wants to do
while everyone else squirms in silence. Since
news of Lenihan’s illness broke—just days
after he’d learned of it himself, apparently,
and before he’d told his children—he’s min-
imized hissuffering. Running under thepub-
lic opinion polls that show the Irish feel a lot
better about the minister of finance than
they do about other politicians in his party is
a common, unspoken understanding of his
†
bravery.
Brian Lenihan is also, as Joan Burton poin-

evening when I meet him in a Department of
Finance conference room. He’s spent most of
his day defending the harshest spending cuts
and tax hikes in Irish history to Irish politi-
cians, without offering any details about
who, exactly, will pay for the bank’s losses.
(He’s waiting until after the single by-elec-
tion that the Dáil authorized is held.) He
smiles. “Why is everyone so interested in Ire-
land?” he asks, almost innocently. “There’s
really far too much interest in us right now.”
“Because you’re interesting?” I say.
“Oh no,” he’s says, seriously. “We’re not,
really.”
He proceeds to make the collapse of the
Irish economy as uninteresting as possible.
This awkward social responsibility—normal-
izing a freak show—is now a meaningful part
of the job of being Ireland’s finance minister.
At just the moment the crazy uncle leapt
from the cellar, the drunken aunt lurched
through the front door—and, in front of the

entire family and many important guests,
they carved each other to bits with hunting
knives. Daddy must now reassure eyewit-
nesses that they didn’t see what they think
they saw.
But the evidence that something deeply
weird just happened in Ireland is still too
conspicuous. A mile from the conference
table where we take our seats you can still
find a moonscape of vast two-year-old
craters from which office parks were once
meant to rise. Fully finished skyscrapers sit
empty, water pooling on their lobby floors.
There’s a skeleton of a tower, cranes at rest
on either side, like parentheses. It was meant
to house Anglo Irish Bank. There’s an empty
new conference center that cost 75 million
euros to build that has never been hooked up
to the Dublin sewer and water systems.
There’s a city dump for which a developer

now, when you include the cleanup costs,

valued at negative 30 million euros. “Ireland
is very unusual,” says William Newsom, who
has forty years of experience valuing com-
mercial real estate for Savills in London.
“There are whole swaths of either un-
developed land with planning permission or
even partially developed sites which for prac-
tical purposes have zero value.” The peak of
the Irish madness is frozen in time for all to
see. There’s even an empty Starbucks, in the
heart of what was meant to be a global finan-
cial center to rival London, where a carton of
low-fat milk curdles beside a silver barista
pitcher. The finance minister might as well
be standing in front of Pompeii and saying
that the volcano wasn’t really worth men-
tioning.Just a little lava!
“THIS ISN’T ICELAND,” is what he actually says.
“We’re not a hedge fund that’s populated by
300,000 farmers and fishermen. Ireland is
not going back to the eighties or the nineties.
This is all in a much narrower band.” And

then he goes off on a soliloquy, the main
point of which is: Ireland’s problems are
solvable and I am in control of the situation.
Back in September 2008, however, there
was evidence that he wasn’t. On September
17 the financial markets were in turmoil.
Lehman Brothers had failed two days earlier,
and the shares of Irish banks were plummet-
ing and big corporations were withdrawing
their deposits from them. Late that night
Lenihan phoned David McWilliams, a
former research analyst with UBS in Zurich
and London, who had moved back home to
Dublin and turned himself into a writer and
media personality. McWilliams had been
loudly skeptical about the Irish real estate
boom. Two weeks earlier he’d appeared on a
television show with Lenihan: Lenihan had
seemed to him entirely untroubled by the
turmoil in the financial markets. Now he
wanted to drive out and ask McWilliams’s
advice on what to do about the Irish banks.

                     PAGE 216                     
==================================================

216/396
The peculiar scene appears in McWilli-
ams’s charmingly indiscreet book Follow the
Money. Lenihan arrives at the McWilliams
residence, a forty-five minute drive outside
of Dublin, marches through to the family kit-
chen, and pulls a hunk of raw garlic out of
his jacket pocket. “He kicked off by saying if
his officials knew he was here in my house,
there’d be war,” writes McWilliams. The fin-
ance minister stayed until two in the morn-
ing, peeling cloves of raw garlic and eating
them, and anxiously picking McWilliams’s
brain. McWilliams came away with the feel-
ing that the minister didn’t entirely trust the
advice he was getting from the people
around him—and that he was not merely
worried but confused. McWilliams told me
that he sensed the mental state of the Fin-
ance Ministry was “complete chaos.”
A week later the Irish Finance Ministry
hired investment bankers from Merrill
Lynch to advise them. Some might say that if

you were asking Merrill Lynch for financial
advice in 2008 you were already in trouble,
but that is not entirely fair. The bank analyst
who had been most prescient and interesting
about the Irish banks worked for Merrill
Lynch. His name was Philip Ingram. In his
late twenties, and a bit quirky—at Cambridge
University he’d prepared for a career in zo-
ology—Ingram had done something original
and useful. He’d shined a new light on the
way Irish banks lent against commercial real
estate.
The commercial real estate loan market is
generally less transparent than the market
for home loans. The deals between bankers
and property developers are one-off, on
terms unknown to all but a few insiders. The
parties to any loan always claim it is
prudent: a bank analyst has little choice but
to take them at their word. But Ingram was
skeptical of the Irish banks. He had read
Morgan Kelly’s newspaper articles and even



==================================================
                     PAGE 218                     
==================================================

218/396
paid Kelly a visit in his University College of-
fice. To Ingram’s eyes there appeared to be a
vast difference between what the Irish banks
were saying and what they were doing. To
get at it he ignored what they were saying
and went looking for knowledgeable insiders
in the commercial property market. He in-
terviewed them, as a journalist might. On
March 13, 2008, six months before the Irish
real estate Ponzi scheme collapsed, Ingram
publishedareportinwhichhesimplyquoted
verbatim what market insiders had told him
about various banks’ lending to commercial
real estate developers. The Irish banks were
making far riskier loans in Ireland than they
were in Britain, but even in Britain, the re-
port revealed, they were the nuttiest lenders
around: in that category, Anglo Irish, Bank
of Ireland, and AIB came, in that order, first,
second, and third.
FORAFEW hours the Merrill Lynch report was
the hottest read in the London financial

markets, until Merrill Lynch retracted it.
Merrill was the lead underwriter of Anglo
Irish’s bonds and the corporate broker to
AIB: they’d earned huge sums of money off
the growth of Irish banking. Moments after
Phil Ingram hit the Send button on his re-
port, the banks called their Merrill Lynch
bankers and threatened to take their busi-
nesselsewhere.ThesameexecutivefromAn-
glo Irish Bank who had called to scream at
Morgan Kelly called a Merrill research ana-
lyst to scream some more. (“I thought your
work was fucking shit!”) Ingram’s superiors
at Merrill Lynch hauled him into meetings
with in-house lawyers who rewrote his re-
port, purging it of its pointed language and
its damning quotes from market insiders, in-
cluding their many references to Irish banks.
Ingram’s immediate boss in the research de-
partment, a fellow named Ed Allchin, was
made to apologize to Merrill’s investment
bankers individually for the trouble he’d

caused them. And from that moment
everything Ingram wrote about Irish banks
was rewritten and bowdlerized by Merrill
Lynch’s lawyers. At the end of 2008 Merrill
fired him.
It would have been difficult for Merrill
Lynch’s investment bankers not to know, on
some level, that, in a reckless market, the
Irish banks acted with a recklessness all their
own. But in the six-page memo to Brian
Lenihan—for which the Irish taxpayer forked
over to Merrill Lynch 7 million euros—they
kept whatever reservations they might have
had to themselves. “All of the Irish banks are
profitable and well-capitalized,” wrote the
Merrill Lynch advisers, and then went on to
suggest that their problem wasn’t at all the
bad loans they had made but the panic in the
market. The Merrill Lynch memo listed a
number of possible responses the Irish gov-
ernment might have to any run on Irish
banks. It refrained from explicitly

recommending one course of action over an-
other, but its analysis of the problem implied
that the most sensible thing to do was to
guarantee the banks. After all, the banks
were “fundamentally sound.” Promise to eat
all losses, and markets would quickly settle
down—and the Irish banks would go back to
being in perfectly good shape. As there
would be no losses, the promise would be
free.
What exactly was said in the meeting on
the night of September 29, 2008, remains,
amazingly, something of a secret. The gov-
ernment has refused Freedom of Informa-
tion Act requests for the notes taken by par-
ticipants. Apart from the prime minister and
the bank regulators, the only people at the
conference table inside the Ministry of Fin-
ance were the heads of the two yet-to-be dis-
graced big Irish banks: AIB and Bank of Ire-
land.EvidentlytheyeitherliedtoBrianLeni-

know themselves what those were. Or both.
“At the time they were all saying the same
thing,” an Irish bank analyst tells me. “‘We
don’t have any subprime.’” What they meant
wasthattheyhadavoidedlendingtoAmeric-
an subprime borrowers; what they neglected
tomention wasthat,inthegeneral frenzy, all
of Ireland had become subprime. Otherwise
sound Irish borrowers had been rendered
unsound by the size of the loans they had
taken out to buy inflated Irish property. That
had been the strangest consequence of the
Irish bubble: to throw a nation that had fi-
nally clawed its way of out centuries of in-
dentured servitude back into indentured
servitude.
The report from Merrill Lynch asserting
that the banks were “fundamentally sound”
buttressed whatever story the banks told the
finance minister. The Irish government’s
bank regulator, Patrick Neary, had echoed
Merrill’s judgment. Morgan Kelly was still a

zany egghead; at any rate, no one who took
him seriously waspresent intheroom. Anglo
Irish’s stock had fallen 46 percent that day;
AIB’s had fallen 15 percent; there was a fair
chance that when the stock exchange re-
opened one or both of them would go out of
business. In the general panic, absent gov-
ernment intervention, the other banks would
have gone down with Anglo Irish. Lenihan
faced a choice: Should he believe the people
immediately around him or the financial
markets? Should he trust the family or the
experts? He stuck with the family. Ireland
gave its promise. And the promise sank
Ireland.
EVEN AT THE time, the decision seemed a bit
odd. The Irish banks, like the big American
banks, managed to persuade a lot of people
that they were so intertwined with their eco-
nomy that their failure would bring down a
lot of other things, too. But they weren’t, at
least not all of them. Anglo Irish Bank had

only six branches, no ATMs, and no organic
relationship with Irish business except the
property developers. It lent money to people
to buy land and build: that’s all it did. It did
this with money it had borrowed from for-
eigners. It was not, by nature, systemic. It
became so only when its losses were made
everyone’s.
Inanycase,iftheIrishwantedtosavetheir
banks, why not guarantee just the deposits?
There’s a big difference between depositors
and bondholders: depositors can flee. The
immediate danger to the banks was that
savers who had put money into them would
take their money out, and the banks would
be without funds. The investors who owned
the roughly 80 billion euros’ worth of Irish
bank bonds, on the other hand, were stuck.
They couldn’t take their money out of the
bank. And their 80 billion euros very nearly
exactly covered the eventual losses inside the
Irish banks. These private bondholders

didn’t have any right to be made whole by
the Irish government. The bondholders
didn’t even expect to be made whole by the
Irish government. Not long ago I spoke with
a former senior Merrill Lynch bond trader
who,onSeptember29,2008,ownedapileof
bonds in one of the Irish banks. He’d already
tried to sell them back to the bank for 50
cents on the dollar—that is, he’d offered to
take a huge loss, just to get out of them. On
the morning of September 30 he awakened
to find his bonds worth 100 cents on the dol-
lar. The Irish government had guaranteed
them! He couldn’t believe his luck.
Across the financial markets this episode
repeated itself. People who had made a
private bet that had gone wrong and didn’t
expect to be repaid in full were handed their
money back—from the Irish taxpayer.
In retrospect, now that the Irish bank
losses are known to be world historically
huge, the decision to cover them appears not

merely odd but suicidal. A handful of Irish
bankers incurred debts they could never re-
pay, of something like 100 billion euros.
They may have had no idea what they were
doing, but they did it all the same. Their
debts were private—owed by them to in-
vestors around the world—and still the Irish
people have undertaken to repay them as if
they were obligations of the state. For two
years they have labored under this im-
possible burden with scarcely a peep of
protest. What’s more, all of the policy de-
cisions since September 29, 2008, have set
the hook more firmly inside the mouths of
the Irish public. In January 2009 the Irish
government nationalized Anglo Irish and its
losses of 34 billion euros (and mounting). In
late 2009 they created the National Asset
Management Agency, the Irish version of the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), but,
unlike the U.S. government, actually

followed through, and bought 80 billion
euros’ worth of crappy assets from the Irish
banks.
A SINGLE DECISION sank Ireland, but when I
ask Lenihan about it he becomes impatient,
as if it isn’t a fit topic for conversation. It
wasn’t much of a decision, he says, as he had
no choice. Irish financial market rules are
patterned on English law, and under English
law the bondholders enjoy the same status as
the ordinary depositors. That is, it was
against the law to protect the little people
with deposits in the bank without also saving
the big investors who owned Irish bank
bonds.
This rings a bell. When U.S. Treasury Sec-
retary Hank Paulson realized that allowing
Lehman Brothers to fail was viewed not as
brave and principled but catastrophic, he,
too, claimed he’d done what he’d done be-
cause the law gave him no other option. In
the heat of the crisis, Paulson neglected to

mention the law, just as Lenihan didn’t bring
up the law requiring him to pay off the
banks’ private lenders until long after he’d
done it. In both cases the explanation was
legalistic: narrowly true, but generally false.
The Irish government always had the power
to impose losses on even the senior bond-
holders, if it wanted to. “Senior people have
forgotten that the government has certain
powers,” as Morgan Kelly puts it. “You can
conscript people. You can send them off to
certain death.You can change the law.”
On September 30, 2008, in the heat of the
moment, Lenihan gave the same argument
for guaranteeing the bank’s debts as Merrill
Lynch: to prevent “contagion.” Tell financial
markets that a loan to an Irish bank was a
loan to the Irish government and investors
would calm down. For who would doubt the
credit of the Irish government? A few
months later, when suspicions arose that the
bank losses were so vast that they might

bankrupt the Irish government, Lenihan
offered a new reason for the government’s
gift to private investors: the bonds were
owned by Irish savings banks. Up until then
the government’s line had been that they did
not have any idea who owned the bank’s
bonds. Now they said that if the Irish gov-
ernment didn’t eat the losses, Irish savers
would pay the price. The Irish, in other
words, were simply saving the Irish. This
wasn’ttrue:itprovokedacryofoutragefrom
the Irish savings banks, who said they didn’t
own the bonds, and that they disapproved of
the government’s bestowing a huge gift on
those who did. A political investigative blog
called Guido Fawkes somehow obtained a
list of the foreign bondholders: German
banks, French banks, German investment
funds, Goldman Sachs. (Yes: even the Irish
did their bit for Goldman.)
ACROSS EUROPE JUST now men who thought
their title was “minister of finance” have

woken up to the idea that their job is actually
government bond salesman. The Irish bank
losses have obviously bankrupted Ireland,
but the Irish finance minister does not want
to talk about that. Instead he mentions to
me, several times, that Ireland is “fully fun-
ded” until next summer. That is, the Irish
government has enough cash in the bank to
pay its bills until next July.
It isn’t until I’m on my way out the door
that I realize how trivial this point is. The
blunt truth is that since September 2008 Ire-
land has been every day more at the mercy of
her creditors. To remain afloat, Ireland’s
banks, which are now owned by the Irish
government, have taken short-term loans
from the European Central Bank of 85 bil-
lion euros. Inside of a week Lenihan will be
compelled by the European Union to invite
the IMF into Ireland, relinquish control of
Irish finances, and accept a bailout package.
The Irish public doesn’t yet know it, but,

==================================================

231/396
even as the minister of finance and I sit to-
gether at his conference table, the European
Central Bank has lost interest in lending to
Irish banks. And soon Brian Lenihan will
stand up in the Irish parliament and offer a
fourth explanation for why private investors
in Ireland’s banks cannot be allowed to take
losses. “There is simply no way that this
country, whose banks are so dependent on
international investors, can unilaterally
renege on senior bondholders against the
wishes of the ECB,” he will say.
But there was once a time when the wishes
of the ECB didn’t matter so much to Ireland.
That time was before the Irish government
used ECB money to pay off the foreign bond-
holders in Irish banks.

result was a fellow I will call Ian McRory,
who is Irish, and a driver, but pretty clearly a
lot of other things, too. He has what appears
to be a military-grade navigational system,
for instance, and surprising knowledge about
abstruse and secretive matters. “I do some
personal security, and things of that nature,”
he says, when I ask him what else he does
other than drive financial-disaster tourists
back and forth across Ireland, and leaves it
at that. Later, when I mention the name of a
formerly rich Irish property developer, he
says, casually, as if it were all in a day’s work,
that he had “let himself into” the fellow’s va-
cation house and snapped photographs of
the interior “for a man I know who is think-
ing of buying it.”
Ian turns out to have a good feel for what
little I, or anyone else, might find interesting
in rural Ireland. He will say, for example,
“Over there, that’s a pretty typical fairy ring,”
and then explain, interestingly, that these



==================================================
                     PAGE 233                     
==================================================

233/396
circles of stones or mushrooms that occur
seemingly naturally in Irish fields are be-
lieved by local farmers to house mythical
creatures. “Irish people actually believe in
fairies?” I will ask, straining but failing to
catch a glimpse of the typical fairy ring to
which Ian has just pointed. “I mean if you
walked right up and asked him to his face,
‘Do you believe in fairies?’ most guys will
deny it,” he will reply. “But if you ask him to
dig out the fairy ring on his property, he
won’t do it. To my way of thinking that’s be-
lieving.” And it is. It’s a tactical belief, a be-
lief that exists because the upside to disbelief
is too small, like the former Irish belief that
Irish land prices could rise forever.
The highway out of Dublin runs past aban-
doned building sites and neighborhoods
without people in them. “We can stop at
ghost estates on the way,” says Ian, as we
clear the suburbs of Dublin. “But if we stop
at every one of them, we’ll never get out of

here.” We pass wet green fields carved by
potato farmers into small plots and, every
now and then, a small village, but even the
inhabited places feel desolate. The Irish
countryside remains a place people flee.
Among its drawbacks, from the outsider’s
point of view, is the weather. “It’s always
either raining or about to rain,” says Ian. “I
drove a black guy from Africa around the
country once. It’s raining the whole time. He
says to me, ‘I don’t know why people live
here. It’s like living under an elephant.’”

but each other, ending with unoccupied slabs
of concrete buried in weeds. You can see the

and the Polish workers went home. “The

crete slab, like the completed houses, is riven
by the cracks that you see in a house after a
major earthquake but which in this case are
caused by carelessness. Inside, the floors are
littered with trash and debris, the fixtures
have been ripped out of the kitchen, and
mold spreads spiderlike across the walls. The
last time I saw an interior like this was in
New Orleans after Katrina.

which more than 100,000 are unoccupied.
Some of those that are occupied remain un-
finished. Virtually all construction has now
ceased. There aren’t enough people in Ire-
land to fill the new houses; there were never
enough people in Ireland to fill the new
houses. Ask Irish property developers who
they imagined was going to live in the Irish
countryside and they all laugh the same un-
easy laugh and offer up the same list of pro-
spects: Poles; foreigners looking for second
homes; entire departments of Irish govern-
ment workers, who would be shipped to the
sticks in a massive, planned relocation plan
that somehow never materialized; the dia-
spora of seventy million human beings with
some genetic link to Ireland. The problem
that no one paid all that much attention to
during the boom was that people from out-
side Ireland, even those with a genetic link to
the place, have no interest in owning houses

their own police. In Ireland the money was
borrowed by a few banks, and yet the people
seem not only willing to repay it but to do so
without so much as a small moan. Back in
the autumn of 2008, after the government
threatened to means-test the medical care,
the old people had marched in the streets of
Dublin. A few days after I’d arrived, the stu-
dents followed suit, but their protest was less
public anger than theater, and perhaps an
excuse to skip school. (DOWN WITH THIS SORT
OF THING, read one of the signs.) I’d tapped
two students as they stumbled away from the
event, to ask them why they had all painted
yellow streaks onto their faces. They looked
at each other for a beat. “Dunno!” one finally
said, and burst out laughing.
Other than that . . . silence. It’s more than
three years since the Irish government fois-
ted the losses of the Irish banks on the Irish
people, and in that time there have been only
two conspicuous acts of Irish social unrest.

In early 2009, at AIB’s first shareholder
meeting after the collapse, a senior citizen
hurled rotten eggs at the bank’s executives.
And late one night in September 2010, a
property developer from Galway named Joe
McNamara painted his cement mixer with
anti-banker slogans, climbed inside the cab,
drove across the country, and, after locking
its brakes and disabling the release, stalled
the machine between the gates of the Parlia-
ment. The elderly egg-thrower was a distant
memory, but McNamara was still, more or
less, in the news: declining requests for in-
terviews. “Joe is a private person,” his lawyer
told me. “Joe feels like he’s made his point.
He doesn’t want any media attention.”
Before he’d parked his cement mixer in the
Parliament’s driveway, McNamara had been
a small-time builder. He’d started out laying
foundations, and, like a lot of tradesmen
from the sticks, he’d been given a loan by
Anglo Irish Bank. Thus began his career as a

property developer. He’d moved to Galway,
into a tacky new development beside a golf
course, but the source of his financial dis-
tress lay an hour or so beyond the city, in a
resort hotel he’d tried to build in the tiny vil-
lage in which he’d gown up, called Keel, on a
remote island called Achill. “Achill,” says
Ian, after I tell him that’s where I’d like him
to drive me, then goes silent for a minute, as
if giving me time to reconsider. “This time of
year Achill’s going to be fairly bleak.” He
thinks another minute. “Mind you, in the
summer it can be fairly bleak as well.”
It’s twilight as we roll across the tiny bridge
and onto the island. On either side of the
snaking single-lane road, peat bogs stretch
as far as the eye can see. The feel is less
“tourist destination” than “end of the earth.”
(“The next stop is Newfoundland,” says Ian.)
The Achill Head Hotel—Joe’s first venture,
still run by his ex-wife—was closed and dark.
But there, smack in the middle of the tiny

village of his hometown of Keel, was the
source of all of Joe McNamara’s financial
troubles: a giant black hole, surrounded by
bulldozers and materials. He’d set out in
2005 to build a modest one-story hotel with
twelve rooms. In April 2006, with the Irish
property market exploding, he’d expanded
his ambition and applied for permission to
build a multistory luxury hotel. At exactly
that moment, the market turned. “We went
away in June of 2006,” Ronan O’ Driscoll,
theSavillsbroker,toldme.“Wecamebackin
September and everything had just stopped.
How does everyone decide at once that it is
time to stop—that it’s become mad?”
For the past four years the hotel site had
scarred the village. But it wasn’t until May
2010 that Anglo Irish Bank, which had lent
McNamara the money to develop it,
threatened to force him into receivership.
Irish bankruptcy laws were not designed for
spectacular failure, perhaps because the

peoplewhowrotethemneverimaginedspec-
tacular success. When a bank forces an Irish
person into receivership, it follows up with a
letter to his blood relations, informing them
of his insolvency—and his shame. A notice of
the bankruptcy is published in one national
and one local newspaper. For as many as
twelve years the Irish bankrupt is not per-
mitted to take out a loan for more than 650
euros, or to own assets amounting to more
than 3,100 euros, or to travel abroad without
government permission. For twelve years
part of what he earns may pass directly to his
creditors. “It’s not like the United States,
where being bankrupt is almost a badge of
honor,” says Patrick White, of the Irish Prop-
erty Council. “Here you are effectively dis-
barred from commercial life.”
There is an ancient rule of financial life—if
you owe the bank 5 million bucks, the bank
owns you, but if you owe the bank 5 billion
bucks, you own the bank—that newly applies

to Ireland. The debts of Ireland’s big prop-
erty developers—defined as anyone who
owed the bank more than 20 million
euros—are now being worked out behind
closed doors. In exchange for helping the
government to manage or liquidate their real
estate portfolios, the biggest failures have
been spared bankruptcy. Smaller developers,
like McNamara, are in a far harder place;
and while no one seems to know how many
of these people exist, the number is clearly
big. Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency controls roughly 80 billion euros’
worthofcommercial propertyloans.AnIrish
property expert named Peter Bacon, who ad-
vised NAMA when it was created, recently
revealed that when he’d added up the smal-
ler Irish property-related loans (those under
20 million euros), they amounted to another
80 billion euros. Some very large number of
former Irish tradesmen are in exactly Joe
McNamara’s situation. Some very large

number of Irish homeowners are in
something very like it.
The difference between McNamara and
everyone else is that he’d complained about
it, publicly. But then, apparently, had genu-
inely thought better of it. I’d tracked down
and phoned his ex-wife, who just laughed
and told me to get lost. I finally reached
McNamara himself, ambushing him on his
cell phone. But he only muttered something
about not wanting to draw further attention
to himself, then hung up. It was only after I
texted him to say I was en route to his ho-
metown that he became sufficiently aroused
to communicate. “What are you doing in
Keel????” he hollered by text message, more
than once. “Tell me Why are you going to
Keel???” Then, once again, he fell silent.
“The problem with the Irish people,” Ian
says, as we drive away from the black hole
that bankrupted Joe McNamara, “is that you
can push them and push them and push

them. But when they break they go wacko.”
(A month later, after a period of silence,
McNamara would reappear, screaming from
the top ofa building crane that he had driven
across the country and ditched, once again,
in front of the Parliament.)
TWOTHINGSSTRIKE every Irish person when he
comes to America, Irish friends tell me: the
vastness of the country, and the seemingly
endlessdesireofitspeopletotalkabouttheir
personal problems. Two things strike an
American when he comes to Ireland: how
small it is, and how tight-lipped. An Irish
person with a personal problem takes it into
a hole with him, like a squirrel with a nut be-
fore winter. He tortures himself and some-
times his loved ones, too. What he doesn’t
do, if he has suffered some reversal, is vent
about it to the outside world. The famous
Irish gift of gab is a cover for all the things
they aren’t telling you.

So far as I could see, by November 10,
2010, the population of Irish people willing
to make a stink about what has happened to
them had been reduced to one: the egg-
thrower. The next day we pull up outside his
home, a modest old row house on the out-
skirts of Dublin. The cheery elderly gentle-
man who opens the door in a neat burgundy
sweater and well-pressed slacks has, among
his other qualities, fantastically good man-
ners. He has the ability to seem pleased even
when total strangers ring his doorbell, and to
make them feel welcome. On the table in
Gary Keogh’s small and tidy dining room is a
book, created by his grandchildren, dated
May 2009. Granddad’s Eggcellent Adven-
ture,it is called.
In the months after Brian Lenihan’s bank
bailout, Keogh, for the first time in his life,
began to pay attention to the behavior of the
Irish bankers. His own shares in AIB, once
thought to be as sound as cash or gold, were

rapidly becoming worthless, but the bank’s
executives exhibited not the first hint of re-
morse or shame. AIB’s chairman, Dermot
Gleeson, and its CEO, Eugene Sheehy,
troubledhimthemost.“Thetwoof’emstood
up, time and again, and said, ‘Our bank is
one hundred percent sound,’” explains
Keogh. “As if nothing at all was the matter!”
He set out to learn more about these people
in whom he had always placed blind trust.
What he found—high pay, corporate boon-
doggles—outraged him further. “The chair-
man paid himself four hundred seventy-five
thousand to chair twelve meetings!” he still
shouts.
What Keogh learned remains both the
most shocking and the most familiar aspect
of the Irish catastrophe: how easily ancient
financial institutions abandoned their tradi-
tions and principles. An upstart bank, Anglo
Irish, had entered their market, and pro-
fessed to have found a new and better way to

beabanker. Anglomadeincredibly quickde-
cisions: an Irish property developer could
walk into Anglo’s office in the late afternoon
with a new idea and walk out with hundreds
of millions of euros the same night. Anglo
was able to shovel money out its door so
quickly because it had turned banking into a
family affair: if they liked the man they
didn’t bother to evaluate his project.
Rather than point out the insanity of the
approach, the two old Irish banks simply
caved to it. An Irish businessman named
DenisO’BriensatontheboardoftheBankof
Ireland in 2005, when it was faced with the
astonishing growth of Anglo Irish. (Anglo
Irish was about to double in size in just two
years.) “I remember the CEO coming in and
saying, ‘We’re going to grow at 30 percent a
year,’” O Brien told me. “I said how the fuck
are you going to do that? Banking is a five-
to-seven-percent-a-year growth business at
best.”

They did it by doing what Anglo Irish had
done: writing checks to Irish property de-
velopers to buy Irish land at any price. AIB,
which had paid its lending officers based on
how many dollars they lent, opened a unit
nicknamed ABA (Anybody but Anglo), dedic-
atedtopoachingAnglo’sbiggestpropertyde-
veloper clients—the very people who would
become the most spectacular busts in Irish
history. In October 2008 the Irish Times
published a list of the five biggest real estate
deals from the past three years. Allied Irish
lent the money for ten of the fifteen, Anglo
Irish for just one. On Irish national radio the
insolvent property developer Simon Kelly,
who personally owes 200 million euros to
various Irish banks and who belongs to a
partnership that owes another 2 billion
euros, confessed that the only time in his ca-
reer a banker became upset with him was
when he repaid a loan, to Anglo Irish—with
money borrowed from Allied Irish. The

former Anglo Irish executives I interviewed
(off the record, as they are all in hiding)
speak of their older, more respectable imitat-
ors with a kind of amazement. “Yes, we were
out of control,” they say, in so many words.
“But those guys werefucking nuts.”
Gary Keogh thought about how Ireland had
changed from his youth, when the country
was dirt poor. “I used to collect bottle caps,”
he says. “Now the health service doesn’t even
bother to take back crutches anymore? No!
We’re far too wealthy.” Unlike most people
he knew, Keogh had no debts. “I had nothing
to lose,” he says. “I didn’t owe anyone any
money. That’s why I could do it!” He’d also
just recovered from a serious illness, and felt
a bit as if he was playing with house money.
“I had just got a new kidney and I was very
pleased with it,” he says. “But I think it must
have been Che Guevera’s kidney.” He de-
scribes his elaborate plot the way an assassin
might describe the perfect hit. “I only had

two rotten eggs,” he says, “but by God they
were rotten! Because I kept them six weeks
in the garage!”
The AIB shareholders meeting of March
2009 was the first he’d ever attended. He
was, he admits, a bit worried something
might go wrong. Worried parking might be a
problem, he took the bus; worried that his
eggs might break, he designed a container to
protect them; worried that he didn’t even
know what the room looked like, he left him-
self time to case the meeting hall. “I got to
the front door early and had a little recce,” as
he puts it, “just to see what was going to hap-
pen.” His egg container was too large to
sneak inside, so he ditched it. “I had one egg
in each jacket pocket,” he says. Worried that
his eggs might be too slippery to grip and
throw, he’d wrapped each of them in a thin
layer of cellophane. “I positioned myself four
rows back and four seats in,” he says. “Not

too close but not too far.” Then he waited for
his moment.
It came immediately. Right after the exec-
utives took their places at the dais, a share-
holder stood up, uninvited, to ask a question.
Gleeson, AIB’s chairman, barked, “Sit
down!”
“He thought he was a dictator!” says
Keogh, who had heard enough. He rose to
his feet and shouted, “I’ve listened to enough
of your crap! You’re a fucking bastard!” And
then he began firing.
“He thought he had been shot,” he says
now with a little smile, “because the first egg
hit the microphone and went Pow!” It
splattered onto the shoulder pad of Gleeson’s
suit. The second egg missed the CEO but
nailed the AIB sign behind him.
Then the security guards were on him. “I
was told I would be arrested and charged,
but I never was,” he says. Of course he
wasn’t: this was, at bottom, a family dispute.

The guards wanted to escort him out, but he
actually left the place on his own and
climbed aboard the next bus home. “The in-
cident happened at ten past ten in the morn-
ing,” he says. “I was home by ten to eleven.
At ten past eleven the phone rang. And I was
on the radio for an hour.” Then, but briefly,
all was madness. “The press descended on
the house and they wouldn’t get out,” he
says. It didn’t really matter; he wasn’t stick-
ing around. He’d done exactly what he’d
planned to do and saw no need to make a
further fuss. He flew out of Dublin Airport at
six the next morning for a long-planned
Mediterranean cruise.

THE SECRET LIVES OF
GERMANS

y the time I arrived in Hamburg, in the
summer of 2011, the fate of the financial uni-
verse seemed to turn on which way the Ger-
man people jumped. Moody’s was set to
downgrade the Portuguese government’s
debt to junk bond status, and Standard &
Poor’s had hinted darkly that Italy might be
next. Ireland was about to be downgraded to
junk status, too, and there was a very real
possibility that the newly elected local Span-
ish governments might seize the moment to

announce that the former local Spanish gov-
ernments had miscalculated, and owed for-
eigners a lot more money than they previ-
ously imagined. Then there was Greece. Of
the 126 countries with rated debt, Greece
now ranked 126th: the Greeks were officially
regarded as the least likely people on the
planet to repay their debts. As the Germans
were not only the biggest creditor of the vari-
ous deadbeat European nations but their
only serious hope for future funding, it was
left to the Germans to act as moral arbiter, to
decide which financial behaviors would be
tolerated and which would not. As a senior
officialattheBundesbankputittome,“Ifwe
say no, it’s no. Nothing happens without
Germany. This is where the losses come to
live.” Just a year ago, when German public
figures called Greeks cheaters, or German
magazines ran headlines like WHY DON'T YOU

dinaryGreekstookitasanoutrageousinsult.

In June of 2011 the Greek government star-
ted selling islands, or at any rate created a
fire-sale list of thousands of properties—golf
courses, beaches, airports, farmlands,
roads—that they hoped to auction in order to
help repay their debts. It’s safe to say that
the idea of doing this had not come from the
Greeks.

I asked the hotel concierge what there was to
see in his city, he had to think for a few
seconds before he said, “Most people just go
to the Reeperbahn.” The Reeperbahn is
Hamburg’s red-light district, the largest red-
light district in the world, according to one
guidebook, though you have to wonder how
anyone figured that out. And the Reeper-
bahn, as it happens, was why I was there.

Perhaps because they have such a gift for
creating difficulties with non-Germans, the
Germans have been on the receiving end of
many scholarly attempts to understand their
collective behavior. In this vast and growing
enterprise a small book with a funny title
towers over many larger, more ponderous
ones. Written in the early 1980s by a distin-
guished American anthropologist named
Alan Dundes, Life Is Like a Chicken Coop
Ladder set out to describe the German char-
acter through the stories that ordinary Ger-
mans liked to tell one another. Dundes spe-
cialized in folklore, and in German folklore,
as he put it, “one finds an inordinate number
of texts concerning Scheisse (shit), Dreck
(dirt), Mist (manure), Arsch (ass). . . . Folk-
songs, folktales, proverbs, riddles, folk
speech—all attest to the Germans’ longstand-
ing special interest in this area of human
activity.”

He proceeded to pile up a shockingly high
stack of evidence to support his theory.
There’s a popular German folk character
called der Dukatenscheisser (The Money
Shitter), who is commonly depicted crapping
coinsfromhisrearend.Theworld’sfirstmu-
seum devoted exclusively to toilets is in Mu-
nich. (A second has opened in New Delhi.)
The German word for “shit” performs a vast
number of bizarre linguistic duties—for in-
stance, a common German term of endear-
ment once was “my little shitbag.” The first
thing Gutenberg sought to publish, after the
Bible, was a laxative timetable he called a
“Purgation-Calendar.” Then there is the as-
tonishing number of anal German folk say-
ings. “As the fish lives in water, so does the
shit stick to the asshole!,” to select but one of
the seemingly endless examples.
Dundes caused a bit ofa stir, for an anthro-
pologist, by tracking this single low national
character trait into the most important

moments in German history. The fiercely
scatological Martin Luther (“I am like ripe
shit and the world is a gigantic ass-hole,”
Luther once explained) had the idea that
launched the Protestant Reformation while
sitting on the john. Mozart’s letters revealed
a mind, as Dundes put it, whose “indulgence
in fecal imagery may be virtually un-
matched.” Hitler’s favorite word was Scheis-
skerl (shithead): he apparently used it to de-
scribe not only other people but himself as
well. After the war Hitler’s doctors told U.S.
intelligence officersthattheirpatient hadde-
voted surprising energy to examining his
own feces; and there was pretty strong evid-
ence that one of his favorite things to do with
women was to have them poop on him. Per-
haps Hitler was so persuasive to Germans,
Dundes suggested, because he shared their
quintessential trait, a public abhorrence of
filth that masked a private obsession. “The
combination of clean and dirty: clean

exterior–dirty interior, or clean form and
dirtycontent—isverymuchapartoftheGer-
man national character,” he wrote.
Dundes confined himself mainly to the
study oflowGerman culture. (For those hop-
ing to examine coprophilia in German high
culture he recommended another book, by a
pair of German scholars, called The Call of
Human Nature: The Role of Scatology in
Modern German Literature.) Still, it was
hard to come away from his treatise without
the strong sense that all Germans, high and
low, were a bit different from you and me—a
point he made in the introduction to the pa-
perback version of his book. “The American
wife of a German-born colleague confessed
to me that she understood her husband
much better after reading the book,” he
wrote. “Prior to that time, she had wrongly
assumed that he must have some kind of pe-
culiar psychological hang-up inasmuch as he

insisted upon discussing at great length the
state of his latest bowel movement.”
The Hamburg red-light district had caught
Dundes’s eye because the locals made such a
big deal of mud wrestling. Naked women
fought in a ring of filth while the spectators
wore plastic caps, a sort of head condom, to
avoid being splattered. “Thus,” wrote
Dundes, “the audience can remain clean
while enjoying dirt!” Germans longed to be
near the shit, but not in it. This, as it turns
out, is an excellent description of their role
in the current financial crisis.
A WEEK EARLIER, in Berlin, I had gone to see
Germany’s deputy minister of finance, a
forty-four-year-old career government offi-
cial named Jörg Asmussen. The Germans
now are in possession of the only Finance
Ministry in the big-time developed world
whose leaders don’t need to worry whether
their economy will collapse the moment in-
vestors stop buying their bonds. As

unemployment in Greece climbs to the
highest on record (16.2 percent, at last
count), it falls in Germany to twenty-year
lows (6.9 percent). Germany appears to have
experienced a financial crisis without eco-
nomic consequences. They’d donned head
condoms in the presence of their bankers,
and avoided being splattered by their mud.
As a result, for the past year or so the finan-
cial markets have been trying and failing to
get a read on the German people: they can
obviously afford to pay off the debts of their
fellow Europeans, but will they actually do
it? Are they now Europeans, or are they still
Germans? Any utterance or gesture by any
German official anywhere near this decision
for the past eighteen months has been a
market-moving headline, and there have
been plenty of them, most of them echoing
German public opinion, and expressing in-
comprehension and outrage that other
people can behave so irresponsibly.

Asmussen is one of the Germans now being
obsessively watched. Along with his boss,
Wolfgang Schäuble, he’s one of two German
officials present in every conversation
between the German government and the
deadbeats.
The Finance Ministry, built in the
mid-1930s, is a monument to both the Nazis’
ambition and their taste. A faceless butte, it
is so big that if you circle it in the wrong dir-
ection it can take you twenty minutes to find
the front door. I circle it in the wrong direc-
tion, then sweat and huff to make up for lost
time, all the while wondering if provincial
Nazis in from the sticks had the same experi-
ence, wandering outside these forbidding
stone walls trying to figure out how to get in.
At length I find a familiar-looking courtyard:
the only difference between its appearance
now and in famous old photographs is that
Hitler is no longer marching in and out of
the entryway, and the statue of the eagle

“It was built for Göring’s Air Ministry,” says
the waiting Finance Ministry public relations
man, who is, oddly enough, French. “You can
tell from the cheerful architecture.” He ex-
plains that the building is so big because
Hermann Göring wanted to be able to land
planes on its roof.
I have arrived about three minutes late, but
the German deputy minister of finance runs
a full five minutes later, which, I will learn, is
viewed by Germans almost as a felony. He
apologizes a great deal more than he needs
to for the delay. He wears the slender framed
spectacles of a German film director, and is
extremely fit and bald, but by choice rather
than circumstance. Extremely fit white men
who shave their heads are making a state-
ment, in my experience of them. “I don’t
need body fat and I don’t need hair,” they
seem to be saying, while also implying that
anyone who does is a wuss. The deputy

finance minister even laughs just as all ex-
tremely fit men with shaved heads should
laugh, if they want to remain in character.
Instead of opening his mouth to allow the air
to pass, he purses his lips and snorts the
sound out through his nose. He may need
laughter as much as other men, but he needs
less air to laugh with. His desk is a template
of self-discipline. Alive with implied activ-
ity—legal pads, Post-it notes, manila
folders—every single object on it is perfectly
alignedwithalltheothersandwiththeedges
of the desk. Every angle is precisely ninety
degrees. But the most striking optional décor
is a big white sign on the wall beside the
desk. It’s in German but translates easily
back into the original English:
THE SECRET OF SUCCESS IS TO UNDERSTAND
THE POINT OF VIEW OF OTHERS.

Thissurprisesme.It’snotatallwhatanex-
tremely fit bald man should have as his man-
tra. It’s soft. The deputy German finance
minister further disturbs my wild assump-
tions about him by speaking clearly, even
recklessly, about subjects most finance min-
isters assume itistheir jobtoobscure. He of-
fers up, without much prompting, that he
has just finished reading the latest unpub-
lished report by IMF investigators on the
progress made by the Greek government in
reforming itself. “They have not implemen-
ted the measures they have promised to im-
plement,” hesayssimply. “Theyarenotmak-
ing the agreed-upon reforms.”
“The people at the IMF put it that clearly?”
I ask.
He turns to page seven of the IMF report,
where it recommends not giving the Greeks
the next tranche of the money the govern-
ment needs to avoid defaulting on its bonds.
“They have a massive problem still with

revenue collection. Not the tax law itself. It’s
thecollectionwhich needs to be overhauled.”
The Greeks are still refusing to pay their
taxes, in other words. But it is only one of
many Greek sins. “Their labor market isn’t
changing as it needs to.” I ask him for an ex-
ample. “They had very clearly as a tradition a
thirteenth or fourteenth monthly salary,” he
says instantly. “Due to developments in the
last ten years, a similar [civil service] job in
Germany pays fifty-five thousand euros. In
Greeceisitseventythousand.”Togetaround
pay restraints in the calendar year, the Greek
government simply paid employees for
months that didn’t exist. “They need to
change the relationship of the people to the
government,” he continues. “It is not a task
that can be done in three months.” Changing
the relationship between any people and its
government, he added, was not a trivial mat-
ter. The Greeks needed to change their cul-
ture. He couldn’t have put this more bluntly:

if the Greeks and the Germans were to coex-
ist in a currency union, the Greeks needed to
change who they are.
This is unlikely to happen soon enough to
matter. The Greeks not only have massive
debts but are still running big deficits.
Trapped by an artificially strong currency,
they cannot turn these deficits into sur-
pluses, even if they do everything outsiders
want them to do. Their exports, priced in
euros, remain expensive. The German gov-
ernment wants the Greeks to slash the size of
their government, but that will also slow eco-
nomic growth and reduce tax revenues. And
so one of two things must happen. Either the
Germans must agree to integrate Europe
fiscally,sothatGermanyandGreecebearthe
same relationship to each other as, say, Indi-
ana and Mississippi—the tax dollars of or-
dinary Germans would go into a common
coffer and be used to pay for the lifestyle of
ordinary Greeks—or the Greeks (and

probably, eventually, every non-German)
must introduce “structural reform,” a eu-
phemism for magically and radically trans-
forming themselves into a people as efficient
and productive as the Germans. The first
solution is pleasant for Greeks but painful
for Germans. The second solution is pleasant
for Germans but painful, possibly even sui-
cidal, for Greeks.
The only economically plausible scenario is
that the Germans, with a bit of help from a
rapidly shrinking population of solvent
European countries, suck it up, work harder,
and pay for everyone else. But what is eco-
nomically plausible appears to be politically
unacceptable. The German people all know
at least one fact about the euro: that before
they agreed to trade in their deutsche marks
their leaders promised them, explicitly, they
would never be required to bail out other
countries. The rule was created with the
founding of the European Central Bank and

was violated in 2010. Public opinion turns
more against the violation every day—so
much so that Chancellor Angela Merkel, who
has a reputation for reading the public
mood, hasn’t even bothered to try to go be-
fore the German people to persuade them
that it might be in their interest to help the
Greeks.
That is why Europe’s money problems feel
not just problematic but intractable. It’s why
Greeks are now mailing bombs to Merkel,
and thugs in Berlin are hurling stones
through the windows of the Greek consulate.
And it’s why European leaders have done
nothing but delay the inevitable reckoning,
by scrambling every few months to find cash
to plug the ever growing holes in Greece, Ire-
land, and Portugal, and praying that bigger
and more alarming holes in Spain, Italy, and
even France do not reveal themselves.
Until now the European Central Bank, in
Frankfurt, has been the main source of this

cash. The ECB was designed to behave with
the same discipline as the Bundesbank but
has been redesigned by the financial crisis
into something else. Already, it has bought,
outright, something like $80 billion in Greek
and Irish and Portuguese government bonds,
and lent another $450 billion or so to vari-
ous European governments and European
banks, accepting virtually any collateral, in-
cluding Greek government bonds. But the
ECB has a rule—and the Germans think the
rule very important—that they cannot accept
as collateral bonds classified by the U.S. rat-
ing agencies as in default. Given that the
ECB once had a rule against buying bonds
outright in the open market, and another
rule against government bailouts, it’s a little
odd that they have gotten so hung up on this
technicality. Buttheyhave.IfGreecedefaults

on its holdings of Greek bonds but must re-

ency, which would mean turning for funds to

many. (The senior official at the Bundesbank
told me they have already thought about how
to deal with the request. “We have thirty-
four hundred tons of gold,” he said. “We are
the only country that has not sold its original
allotment [from the late 1940s]. So we are
covered to some extent.”)
The bigger problem with a Greek default is
thatitmightwellforceotherEuropeancoun-
tries and their banks themselves into default.
At the very least it would create panic and
confusion in the market for both sovereign
and bank debt, at a time when a lot of banks
and at least two big European debt-ridden
countries, Italy and Spain, cannot afford
panic and confusion.
At the bottom of this unholy mess, from
the point of view of the German Finance

Ministry, is the unwillingness, or inability, of
the Greeks to change their behavior. That
was what the currency union always implied:
entirepeopleshadtochangetheirwayoflife.
Conceived as a tool for integrating Germany
with Europe, and preventing the Germans
from dominating others, the euro had be-
come the opposite. For better or worse, the
Germans now control the financial fate of
Europe. If the rest of Europe was to continue
to enjoy the benefits of what was essentially
a German currency they’d need to become
more German. And so, once again, all sorts
of people who would rather not think about
what it means to be “German” are compelled
to do so.
Jörg Asmussen offers the first hint of an
answer in his personal behavior. He was a
type familiar in Germany but absolutely
freakish in Greece or, for that matter, the
United States: a keenly intelligent, highly
ambitious civil servant who had no other



==================================================
                     PAGE 274

ambition but to serve his country. His spark-
ling curriculum vitae was missing a line that
would be found on the résumés of men in his
position almost everywhere else in the
world—the line where he leaves government
service for Goldman Sachs to cash out. When
I asked another prominent German civil ser-
vant why he hadn’t taken time out of public
service to make his fortune working for some
bank, the way every American civil servant
who is anywhere near finance seems to want
to do, his expression changed to alarm. “But
I could never do this,” he said. “It would be
illoyal!” Asmussen echoes this sentiment
whenIaskhimwhyhehasn’tbotheredtoget
rich.
He then addresses the German question
more directly. The curious thing about the
eruption of cheap and indiscriminate lending
of money between 2002 and 2008 was the
different effects it had from country to coun-
try. Every developed country was subjected

to more or less the same temptation, but no
two countries responded in precisely the
same way. Much of Europe had borrowed
money cheaply to buy stuff it couldn’t hon-
estly afford. In effect, lots of non-Germans
had used Germany’s credit rating to indulge
their material desires. The Germans were the
exception. Given the chance to take
something for nothing, the German people
simply ignored the offer. “There was no cred-
it boom in Germany,” says Asmussen. “Real
estate prices were completely flat. There was
no borrowing for consumption. Because this
behavior is totally unacceptable in Germany.
This is what the German people are. This is
deeply in German genes. It is perhaps a
leftover of the collective memory of the Great
Depression and the hyperinflation of the
1920s.”TheGermangovernmentwasequally
prudent because, he went on, “there is a con-
sensus among the different parties about
this: if you’re not adhering to fiscal

responsibility you have no chance in elec-
tions, because the people are that way.”
In the moment of temptation Germany be-
came something like a mirror image to Ice-
land and Ireland and Greece—and the Un-
ited States. Other countries used foreign
money to fuel various forms of insanity. The
Germans, through their bankers, used their
own money to enable foreigners to behave
insanely.
This is what makes the German case so pe-
culiar. If they had been merely the only big,
developed nation with decent financial mor-
als, they would present one sort of picture, of
simple rectitude. But they had done
something far less common: during the
boom German bankers had gone out of their
way to get dirty. They lent money to Americ-
an subprime borrowers, to Irish real estate
barons, to Icelandic banking tycoons, to do
things that no German ever would do. The
German losses are still being toted up, but at

last count they stand at $21 billion in the
Icelandic banks, $100 billion in Irish banks,
$60 billion in various U.S. subprime-backed
bonds, and some yet to be determined
amount in Greek bonds. The only financial
disaster in the last decade German bankers
appear to have missed was investing with
Bernie Madoff (perhaps the only advantage
to the German financial system of having no
Jews). In their own country, however, these
seemingly crazed bankers behaved with re-
straint. The German people did not allow
them to behave otherwise. It was another
case of clean on the outside, dirty on the in-
side. The German banks that wanted to get a
little dirty needed to go abroad to do it.
About this the deputy finance minister has
not that much to say, though he does won-
der, idly, how a real estate crisis in Florida
ends with massive financial losses in Ger-
many.Thatsuchathinghashappenedseems
genuinely to puzzle him.

A GERMAN ECONOMIST named Henrik Ender-
lein, who teaches at the Hertie School of
Governance in Berlin, has described the rad-
ical change that occurred in German banks
beginning about 2003. In a paper in pro-
gress, Enderlein points out, “Many observers
initially believed German banks would be re-
latively less exposed to the crisis. The con-
trary turned out to be the case. German
banks ended up being among the most af-
fected in continental Europe and this despite
relatively favorable economic conditions.”
Everyone thought that German bankers were
more conservative, and more isolated from
the outside world, than, say, the French. And
it wasn’t true. “There had never been any in-
novation in German banking,” says Ender-
lein.“Yougavemoneytosomecompany,and
the company paid you back. They went [vir-
tually overnight] from this to being Americ-
an. And they weren’t any good at it.”

What Germans did with money between
2003 and 2008 would never have been pos-
sible within Germany, as there was no one to
take the other side of the many deals they
did that made no sense. They lost massive
sums, in everything they touched, from U.S.
subprime loans to Greek government bonds.
Indeed, one view of the European debt
crisis—the Greek street view—is that it is an
elaborate attempt by the German govern-
ment on behalf of its banks to get their
moneybackwithoutcalling attention towhat
they are up to. The German government
gives money to the European Union rescue
fund so that it can give money to the Irish
government sothattheIrishgovernment can
give money to Irish banks, so the Irish banks
can repay their loans to the German banks.
“They are playing billiards,” says Enderlein.
“Theeasier waytodoitwouldbetogiveGer-
man money to the German banks and let the

Irish banks fail.” Why they don’t simply do
this is a question worth trying to answer.
THE TWENTY-MINUTE WALK from the German
Finance Ministry to the office of the chair-
man of Commerzbank, one of Germany’s two
giant private banks, is punctuated by offi-
cially sanctioned memories: the new Holo-
caust Memorial, two and a half times the
acreage occupied by the U.S. Embassy; the
new street beside it, called Hannah Arendt
Street; the signs pointing to Berlin’s new
Jewish Museum; the park that contains the
Berlin Zoo, where, after spending decades
denying they had ever mistreated Jews, the
authorities have newly installed, on the
Antelope House, a plaque commemorating
their Nazi-era expropriation of shares in the
zoo owned by Jews. Along the way you also
pass Hitler’s bunker, but you’d never know it
was there, as it has been paved over by a
parking lot, and the small plaque that com-
memorates it is well hidden. The streets of

Berlin can feel like an elaborate shrine. It’s
as if history stopped and assigned roles to
people, and the Germans have been required
to accept that they will always play the vil-
lain. On the other hand, it’s easier to express
contrition about just about everything the
less personally responsible one feels. The
guilt is being so loudly expressed precisely
because it is no longer personal and searing.
Hardly anyone still alive is responsible for
what happened here: everyone is. But when
everyone is guilty, no one is.
At any rate, if some Martian landed on the
streets of Berlin knowing nothing of its his-
tory, he might wonder: who are these people
called “the Jews,” and how did they come to
run this place? But there are no Jews in Ger-
many, or not many. “The German people
never see Jews,” says Gary Smith, the direct-
or of the American Academy in Berlin. “Jews
are unreal to them. When they think of Jews
they think of victims.” The further away the

German people get from their victims, the
more conspicuously they commemorate
them. Of course no German in his right mind
actually wants to sit around remembering
the terrible crimes committed by his ancest-
ors—and there are signs, including the me-
morials, that they are finding ways to move
on. A good friend of mine, a Jew whose fam-
ily was driven out of Germany in the 1930s,
recently visited a German consulate in the
United States to apply for a passport. He
already held one European passport, but he
worried that the European Union might one
day fall apart, and he wanted access to Ger-
many, just in case. The German official in
charge—an Aryan out of central casting,
wearing a Sound of Music vest—handed him
a copy of a pamphlet titled A Jew’s Life in
Modern Germany.
“Would you mind if we take a picture?” he
asked my friend, after processing his pass-
port application.

“No problem,” said my friend.
“Can we do it in front of the flag?” asked
the official.
My friend stared at the German flag.
“What’s this for?” he asked.
“Our website,” said the German official,
then added that the government hoped to
post the photo with a sign that read: This
man is the descendant of Holocaust surviv-
ors and he has decided to return to
Germany.
COMMERZBANK WAS THE first private bank that
the German government had to rescue dur-
ing the financial crisis, with an injection of
$25 billion, but that’s not why it had caught
my attention. I’d been walking around
Frankfurt one night with a German financier
when I noticed the Commerzbank building
on the skyline. There’s a law in Germany
prohibiting buildings higher than twenty
stories, but Frankfurt allows exceptions. The
Commerzbank Tower is fifty-three stories



==================================================

high and unusually shaped: it resembles a gi-
ant throne. The top of the building, the arms
of the throne, are more decorative than use-
ful. The interesting thing, said the German
financier, whovisited often, is theglass room
at the top, from which one looks down over
Frankfurt. It is a men’s toilet. Commerzbank
executives had taken him there to show him
how, in full view of the world below, he could
shit on Deutsche Bank.
The Commerzbank chairman, Klaus-Peter
Müller, actually works in Berlin, inside an-
other very German kind of place. His office is
attached to the side of the Brandenburg
Gate. The Berlin Wall once ran, roughly
speaking, right through the middle of it. One
sideofhisbuildingwasonceafieldoffirefor

backdrop for Ronald Reagan’s famous

“After the wall came down we were offered
the chance to buy it back,” says Müller. “This
building had been ours before the war. But
the condition was that we had to put
everything back exactly the way it was. It all
had to be hand-fabricated.” He points out
the seemingly antique brass doorknobs and
the seemingly antique windows. Across Ger-
many, in the past twenty years or so, town
centers completely destroyed by bombs in
World War II have been restored, stone by
stone. The German government has agreed
to pay some huge sum of money to rebuild
the Berliner Schloss, the old Royal Palace
that was leveled in the 1950s by the East
German authorities, so that it will look ex-
actly as it does in prewar photographs. If the
trend continues, it will one day appear as if
nothing terrible had ever happened in Ger-
many, when everything terrible happened in
it. “Do not ask me what it cost,” the bank
chairman says, and laughs.

He then offers me the same survey of Ger-
man banking that I will hear from half a
dozen others. German banks are not, like
American banks, mainly private enterprises.
Most are either explicitly state-backed or
small savings co-ops. Commerzbank,
DresdnerBank,andDeutscheBank,allfoun-
ded in the 1870s, are the only three big
private German banks. In 2009 Com-
merzbank bought Dresdner. Both turned out
to be loaded with toxic assets, and so the
merged bank required a government bailout.
“We are not a proprietary trading nation,”
says Müller, getting pretty quickly to the nub
of Germany’s banking problems. German
banking was never meant to be a high-stakes
affair. Banking, done in the proper German
fashion, is less a free enterprise than a util-
ity. “Why should you pay twenty million to a
thirty-two-year-old trader?” Müller asks
himself. “He uses the office space, the IT, the
business card with a first-class name on it. If

I take the business card away from that guy
hewouldprobablysellhotdogs.”Thismanis
the German equivalent of the head of Bank
of America or Citigroup. And he is actively
hostile to the idea that bankers should make
huge sums of money.
In the bargain, he tells me why the current
financial crisis has so unsettled the German
banker’s view of the financial universe. In
the early 1970s, after he started at Com-
merzbank, the bank opened the first New
York branch of any German bank, and he
went to work in it. He mists up a bit when he
tells stories about the Americans he did busi-
ness with back then: in one story, an Americ-
an investment banker who had inadvertently
shut him out of a deal hunts him down and
hands him an envelope with seventy-five
grand in it, because he hadn’t meant for the
German bank to get stiffed. “You have to un-
derstand,” he says emphatically, “this is
where I get my view of Americans.” In the

past few years, he adds, that view had
changed. I sense a feeling of loss.
“How much money did you lose in
subprime?” I ask.
“I don’t want to tell you,” he says.
He laughs and then continues. “For forty
years we didn’t lose a penny on anything
with a triple-A rating,” he says. “We stopped
building the portfolio in subprime in 2006. I
had the idea that there was something wrong
with your market. I did not have the idea
thatyourmarket wouldcompletelycollapse.”
He pauses. “It has told something to me. I
was in the belief that the best supervised of
all banking systems was in New York. To me
the Fed and the SEC were second to none. I
did not believe that there would be e-mail
traffic between investment bankers saying
that they were selling . . .” He pauses again,

The global financial system may exist to
bring borrowers and lenders together, but,
over the past few decades, it has become
something else, too: a tool for maximizing
the number of encounters between the
strong and the weak, so that the one might
exploit the other. Extremely smart traders
inside Wall Street investment banks devise
deeply unfair, diabolically complicated bets,
and then send their sales forces out to scour
the world for some idiot who will take the
other side of those bets. During the boom
years a wildly disproportionate number of
those idiots were in Germany. As a reporter
for Bloomberg News in Frankfurt named
Aaron Kirchfeld put it to me, “You’d talk to a
New York investment banker and they’d say,
‘No one is going to buy this crap. Oh. Wait.
The Landesbanks will!’” When Morgan Stan-
ley designed extremely complicated credit

default swaps so they were all but certain to
fail, so that their own proprietary traders
could bet against them, the buyer was Ger-
man. When Goldman Sachs helped the New
York hedge fund manager John Paulson
design a bond to bet against—a bond that
Paulson hoped would fail—the buyer on the
other side was a German bank called IKB.
IKB, along with another famous fool at the
Wall Street poker table called WestLB, was
based in Düsseldorf—which is why, when
you asked a smart Wall Street subprime
mortgage bond trader circa June 2007 who
was still buying his crap, he could say,
simply, “Stupid Germans in Düsseldorf.”
THE DRIVE FROM Berlin to Düsseldorf takes
longer than it should. For long stretches the
highway is choked with cars and trucks. A
German traffic jam is a peculiar sight: no one
honks, no one switches lanes searching for
some small, illusory advantage, all trucks re-
main in the right-hand lane, where they are

required to be. The spectacle of sparkling
BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes in the left lane
and immaculate trucks in a neat row in the
right lane is almost a pleasure to watch. Be-
cause everyone in the jam obeys the rules,
and believes that everyone else will obey
them,too,thecarsandtrucksmoveasfastas
they can, given the circumstances. But the
pretty young German woman behind the
wheel of our car doesn’t take any pleasure in
it. Charlotte huffs and groans at the sight of
brake lights stretching into the distance. “It’s
what I hate more than anything in the
world,” she says apologetically. “I hate being
stuck in traffic.”
She pulls from her bag the German transla-
tion of Alan Dundes’s book. I’d asked her
about the title. There is a common German
expression, she explains, that translates dir-
ectly as “lick my ass.” To this hearty saluta-
tion the common German reply is, “You lick
minefirst.”TheGermanversionofDundesis

called You Lick Mine First. “Everyone will
understand this title,” she says. “But this
book, I don’t know about this.”
The last time I’d been in Germany for more
than a few days was when I was seventeen
years old. I’d traveled across the country
with two friends, a bike, and a German
phrase book. In my head was a German love
song taught to me by an American woman of
German descent. So few people spoke Eng-
lish that it was better to assume they did not
and deploy whatever German came to
hand—which usually meant the love song.
And so I assumed on this trip I would need
an interpreter. I didn’t appreciate how much
the Germans had been boning up on their
English. The entire population seems to have
taken a total-immersion Berlitz course. And
on Planet Money, even in Germany, English

for all meetings inside the European Central
Bank, for instance, even though the ECB is in

Through a friend of a friend of a friend I’d
landed Charlotte, a sweet-natured, keenly in-

shockingly steely—how many sweet-natured
young women can say “lick my ass” without
blushing? She spoke seven languages, in-
cluding Mandarin and Polish, and was fin-
ishing up her master’s in Intercultural
Misunderstanding, which just has to be
Europe’s next growth industry. By the time I
realized I didn’t need her I’d already hired
her, and so she had ceased to be my inter-
preter and become my driver. As my inter-
preter, she would have been ridiculously
overqualified; as my chauffeur she is frankly
preposterous. But she’d taken on the job
with gusto, going so far as to hunt down an
old German translation of Dundes’s little
book.

And it troubled her. For a start, she refused
to believe there was such a thing as a Ger-
man national character. “No one in my field
believes this anymore,” she says. “How do
you generalize about eighty million people?
You can say they are all the same, but why
would they be this way? My question about
Germans’ being anally obsessed is how
would this spread? Where would it come
from?” Dundes himself actually made a stab
at answering the question. He suggested that
the unusual swaddling techniques employed
by German mothers, which left babies stew-
ingintheirownfilthforlongperiods oftime,
might be responsible for their energetic anal-
ity. Charlotte was not buying it. “I’ve never
heard of this,” she says.
But just then she spots something and
brightens. “Look!” she says. “A German flag.”
Sure enough, a flag flies over a small house
in a distant village. You can spend days in
Germany without seeing a flag. Germans

other people do. That doesn’t mean they
don’t want to, just that they must disguise
what they are doing. “Patriotism,” she says,
“is still taboo. It’s politically incorrect to say,
‘I’m proud to be German.’”
The traffic eases, and we’re once again fly-
ing toward Düsseldorf. The highway looks
brand-new, and she guns the rented BMW
until the speedometer tops 210 kilometers
per hour.
“This is a really good road,” I say.
“The Nazis built it,” she says. “That’s what
people say about Hitler, when they get tired
of saying the usual things. Well, at least he
built good roads.”
BACK IN FEBRUARY 2004 a financial writer in
London named Nicholas Dunbar broke the
story about some Germans in Düsseldorf,
working inside a bank called IKB, who were
up to something new. “The name IKB just
kept coming up in London with bond



==================================================
                     PAGE 296

salesmen,” says Dunbar. “It was like every-
body’s secret cash cow.” Inside the big Wall
Street firms there were people whose job it
was, when the German customers from Düs-
seldorf came to London, to get a wad of cash
and make sure the Germans got whatever
they wanted.
Dunbar’s piece appeared in Risk magazine
and described how this obscure German
bank was rapidly turning into Wall Street’s
biggest customer. IKB had been created back
in 1924 to securitize German war reparation
payments to the Allies, morphed into a suc-
cessful lender to midsized German compan-
ies, and was now morphing into something
else. The bank was partially owned by a Ger-
man state bank, but was not itself guaran-
teed by the German government. It was a
private German financial enterprise, seem-
ingly on the rise. And it had hired a man
named Dirk Röthig, a German with some ex-
perience in the United States (he’d worked



==================================================

for State Street Bank), to do something new
and interesting.
With Röthig’s help IKB created, in effect, a
bank, incorporated in Delaware and listed on
the exchange in Dublin, Ireland, called
Rhineland Funding. They didn’t call it a
bank. If they had called it a bank, people
might have asked why it was not regulated.
They called it a “conduit,” a word that had
the advantage that no one understood what
it meant. Rhineland borrowed money for
short periods of time by issuing something
called commercial paper. They invested it in
longer-term “structured credit,” which
turned out to be a euphemism for bonds
backed by American consumer loans. Many
of the same Wall Street investment banks
that raised the money for Rhineland (by
selling the commercial paper for them) sold
Rhineland the bonds backed by the Americ-
an consumer loans. Rhineland’s profits came
from the difference between the rate of



==================================================
                     PAGE 298                     
==================================================

298/396
interest it paid on the money it borrowed
and the higher rate of interest it earned on
the money it lent through its bond pur-
chases. As IKB guaranteed the entire enter-
prise, Moody’s rating service gave Rhineland
its highest rating, enabling Rhineland to bor-
row money cheaply.
TheGermans in Düsseldorf hadonecritical
job: to advise this offshore vehicle they had
created about which bonds it should buy.
“We are one of the last to get our money out
of Rhineland,” Röthig told Risk magazine,
“but we’re so confident of our ability to ad-
vise it in the right way that we still make a
profit.” Röthig further explained that IKB
had invested in special tools to analyze the
complicated bonds, called collateralized debt
obligations (CDOs),thatWallStreetwasnow
peddling. “I would say it has proven a worth-
while investment because we have not faced
a loss so far,” he said. In February 2004 all
this seemed like a good idea—so good that



==================================================
                     PAGE 299                     
==================================================

299/396
lots of other German banks copied IKB, and
either rented IKB’s conduit or set up their
own offshore vehicles to buy subprime mort-
gage bonds. “It sounds like quite a profitable
strategy,” the man from Moody’s who had
awarded Rhineland’s commercial paper a
triple-A rating toldRiskmagazine.
I met Dirk Röthig for lunch at a restaurant
in Düsseldorf, on a canal lined with busy
shops.From their profitable strategy IKB has
announced losses of roughly $15 billion,
thoughtheir actual lossesare probably great-
er, as German banks are slow to declare any-
thing. Röthig viewed himself, with some
justice, more as victim than perpetrator. “I
left the bank in December 2005,” he says
quickly, as he squeezes himself into a small
booth. Then he explains.
The idea for the offshore bank had been
his. The German management at IKB had
taken to it, as he put it, “like a baby takes to
candy.” He’d created the bank when the

market was paying higher returns to bond-
holders: Rhineland Funding was paid well
for the risk it was taking. By the middle of
2005, with the financial markets refusing to
see a cloud in the sky, the price of risk had
collapsed: the returns on the bonds backed
by American consumer loans had collapsed.
Röthig says he went to his superiors and ar-
gued that, as they were being paid a lot less
to take the risk of these bonds, IKB should
look elsewhere for profits. “But they had a
profit target and they wanted to meet it. To
make the same profit with a lower risk
spread they simply had to buy more,” he
says. The management, he adds, did not
want to hear his message. “I showed them
the market was turning,” he says. “I was tak-
ing the candy away from the baby, instead of
giving it. So I became the enemy.” When he
left, others left with him, and the investment
staffwasreduced,buttheinvestment activity
boomed. “One-half the number of people

withone-thirdtheexperience madetwicethe
number of investments,” he says. “They were
ordered to buy.”
He goes on to describe what appeared to be
a scrupulous and complicated investment
strategy but was actually a mindless, rule-
based investment strategy. IKB could “value
a CDO down to the last basis point,” as one
admiring observer told Risk magazine in
2004. But in this expertise was a kind of
madness. “They would be really anal about,
say, which subprime originator went into
these CDOs,” says Nicholas Dunbar. “They’d
say we won’t take loans from First Franklin
but we will take them from Countrywide. But
it didn’t matter. They were arguing about
bonds that would collapse from one hundred
[par] down to two or three [percent of par].
In a sense they were right: they bought the
bonds that went to three, rather than to
two.” As long as the bonds offered up by the
Wall Street firms abided by the rules

specified by IKB’s experts, they got hoovered
into the Rhineland Funding portfolio
without further inspection. Yet the bonds
were becoming radically more risky, because
the loans that underpinned them were be-
coming crazier and crazier. After he left,
Röthig explains, IKB had only five invest-
ment officers, each in his late twenties, with
a couple of years’ experience: these were the
people on the other end of the bets being
handcrafted by Goldman Sachs for its own
proprietary trading book, and by other big
Wall Street firms for extremely clever hedge
funds that wanted to bet against the market
for subprime bonds. The IKB portfolio went
from $10 billion in 2005 to $20 billion in
2007, Röthig says, “and it would have gotten
bigger if they had had more time to buy.
They were still buying when the market
crashed. They were on their way to thirty bil-
lion dollars.”

==================================================

By the middle of 2007 every Wall Street
firm, not just Goldman Sachs, realized that
the subprime market was collapsing, and
tried frantically to get out of their positions.
The last buyers in the entire world, several
people on Wall Street have told me, were
these willfully oblivious Germans. That is,
the only thing that stopped IKB from losing
even more than $15 billion on U.S. subprime
loans was that the market ceased to function.
Nothing that happened—no fact, no piece of
data—was going to alter their approach to in-
vesting money.
On the surface the IKB’s German bond
traders resembled the reckless traders who
made similarly stupid bets for Citigroup and
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Beneath
it they were playing an entirely different
game. The American bond traders may have
sunk their firms by turning a blind eye to the
risks in the subprime bond market, but they
made a fortune for themselves in the

bargain, and have for the most part never
been called to account. They were paid to put
their firms in jeopardy, and so it is hard to
know whether they did it intentionally or
not. The German bond traders, on the other
hand, had been paid roughly one hundred
thousand dollars a year, with, at most,
another fifty-thousand-dollar bonus. In gen-
eral, German bankers were paid peanuts to
run the risk that sank their banks, which
stronglysuggeststhattheyreallydidn’t know
what they were doing. But—and here is the
strange thing—unlike their American coun-
terparts, they are being treated by the Ger-
man public as crooks. The former CEO of
IKB, Stefan Ortseifen, was given a jail term
(since suspended) and has been asked by the
bank to return his salary: 805 thousand
euros.
Dirk Röthig had enjoyed a ringside seat not
only to IKB but to the behavior of its imitat-
ors, the German state-backed banks, the



==================================================

Landesbanks. And in his view, the border
created by modern finance between Anglo-
American and German bankers was treach-
erous. “The intercultural misunderstandings
were quite intense,” he says, as he tucks into
his lobster. “The people in these banks were
never spoiled by any Wall Street salesmen.
Now there is someone with a platinum
American Express credit card who can take
them to the Grand Prix in Monaco, takes you
to all these places. He has no limit. The
Landesbanks were the most boring bankers
in Germany so they never got attention like
this. And all of a sudden a very smart guy
from Merrill Lynch shows up and starts to
pay a lot of attention to you. They thought,
‘Oh, he just likes me!’” He completes the
thought. “The American salespeople are
much smarter than the European ones. They
play a role much better.”
At bottom, he says, the Germans were
blind to the possibility that the Americans

were playing the game by something other
than the official rules. The Germans took the
rules at their face value: they looked into the
history of triple-A-rated bonds and accepted
the official story that triple-A-rated bonds
were completely risk-free.
This preternatural love of rules almost for
their own sake punctuates German finance
as it does German life. As it happens, a story
had just broken that a German reinsurance
company called Munich Re, back in June
2007,orjustbeforethecrash,hadsponsored
a party for its best producers that offered not
just chicken dinners and nearest-to-the-pin
golf competitions but a blowout with prosti-
tutes in a public bath. In finance, high or
low, this sort of thing is of course not unusu-
al. What was striking was how organized the
German event was. The company tied white
and yellow and red ribbons to the prostitutes
to indicate which ones were available to
which men. After each sexual encounter the

prostitute received a stamp on her arm to in-
dicate how often she had been used. The
Germans didn’t just want hookers: they
wanted hookers withrules.
Perhaps because they were so enamored of
the official rules of finance, the Germans
proved especially vulnerable to a false idea
the rules encouraged: that there is such a
thing as a riskless asset. After all, a triple-A
rating was supposed to mean “riskless asset.”
There is no such thing as a riskless asset. The
reason an asset pays a return is that it carries
risk. But the idea of the riskless asset, which
peaked about late 2006, overran the invest-
ment world, and the Germans fell for it the
hardest. I’d heard about this, too, from
people on Wall Street who had dealt with
German bond buyers. “You have to go back
to the German mentality,” one of them had
told me. “They say, ‘I’ve ticked all the boxes.
There is no risk.’ It was form over substance.
You work with Germans, and—I can’t

emphasize this enough—they are not natural
risk takers. They are genetically disposed to
fuckingitup.”Solongasabondlookedclean
on the outside, the Germans allowed it to be-
come as dirty on the inside as Wall Street
could make it.
The point Röthig wants to stress to me now
is that it didn’t matter what was on the in-
side. IKB had to be rescued by a state-owned
bank on July 28, 2007. Against capital of
roughly $4 billion it had lost more than $15
billion. As it collapsed, the German media
wanted to know how many U.S. subprime
bonds these German bankers had gobbled
up. IKB’s CEO, Stefan Ortseifen, said pub-
licly that IKB owned almost no subprime
bonds at all—which is why he’s now charged
with misleading investors. “He was telling
the truth,” says Röthig. “He didn’t think he
owned any subprime. They weren’t able to
give any correct numbers of the amount of
subprime they had, because they didn’t

                     PAGE 309                     
==================================================

know. The IKB monitoring systems did not
make a distinction between subprime and
prime mortgages. And that’s why it
happened.” Back in 2005, Röthig says, he
proposed to build a system to track more
precisely what loans were behind the com-
plex bonds they were buying from Wall
Street firms, but IKB’s management didn’t
want to spend the money. “I told them you
have a portfolio of twenty billion dollars, you
are making two hundred million dollars a
year and you are denying me six point five
million. But they didn’t want to do it.”
FORTHETHIRD time in as many days we cross
the border without being able to see it, and
spend twenty minutes trying to work out if
we are in East or West Germany. Charlotte
was born and raised in the East German city
of Leipzig, but she is no less uncertain than I
am about which former country we are in.
“You just would not know anymore unless
you are told,” she says. “They have to put up

a sign to mark it.” A landscape once scarred
by trenches and barbed wire and minefields
exhibits not so much as a ripple. On the out-
side, at least, it’s perfectly clean. Somewhere
near this former border we pull off the road
into a gas station. It has three pumps in a
narrow channel without space to maneuver
or to pass. The three drivers filling their gas
tanks need to do it together, and move along
together, for if any one driver dawdles,
everyone else must wait. No driver dawdles.
The German drivers service their cars with
the efficiency of a pit crew. Precisely because
the arrangement is so archaic, Charlotte
guesses we must still be in West Germany.
“You would never find this kind of gas sta-
tion in East Germany,” she says. “Everything
in East Germany is new.” She also claims she
can guess at sight whether a person, and es-
pecially a man, is from the east or the west.
“West Germans are much prouder. They
stand straight. East Germans are more likely

mans are lazy.”
“East Germans are the Greeks of Ger-
many,” I say.
“Be careful,” she says.
From Düsseldorf we drive to Leipzig, and
from Leipzig we hop a train to Hamburg to
find the mud wrestling. Along the way she
humors me by parsing her native tongue for
signs of anality. “Kackwurst is the term for
feces,” she says grudgingly. “It literally

She thinks a moment. “Bescheissen:
someone shit on you. Klugscheisser: an in-
telligence shitter.
“If you have a lot of money,” she continues,
“you are said to shit money: Geldscheisser.”
She rips a handful of other examples off the
top of her head, a little shocked by how fer-
tile is this line of thinking, before she says,
“And if you find yourself in a bad situation,

you say, ‘Die Kacke ist am dampfen the shit
is steaming.’” She stops and appears to real-
ize she is encouraging a theory of German
national character.
“It’s just in the words,” she says.
“Sure it is.”
“It doesn’t mean it applies.”
Outside of Hamburg we stopped for lunch
at a farm owned by a man named Wilhelm
Nölling, a German economist now in his sev-
enties but with the kick and bite of a much
younger man. He has the chiseled features
and silver hair of a patrician but the vocal
cords of a bleacher bum. “The Greeks want
us to pay their lunch!” he bellows, as he gives
me a tour of his private goat pen. “That is
why they are rioting in the streets! Baaa!”
Back when the idea of the euro was being
bandied about, Nölling had been a governor
of the Bundesbank. From the moment the
discussion turned serious he has railed
against the euro. He’d written one mournful

pamphlet called “Good-bye to the Deutsche
Mark?” and another, more declarative
pamphlet called “The Euro: A Journey to
Hell.” Together with three other prominent
German economists and financial leaders
he’d filed a lawsuit, still wending its way
through the German courts, challenging the
euro on constitutional grounds. Just before
the deutsche mark got scrapped, Nölling had
argued to the Bundesbank that they should
just keep all the notes. “I said, ‘Don’t shred
it!” he now says with great gusto, leaping out
of an armchair in the living room of his
farmhouse. “I said, ‘Pile it all up, put it in a
room, in case we need it later!’”
He finds himself stuck: he knows that he is
engaged in an exercise futile and pointless.
“Can you turn this back?” he says. “We know
we can’t turn this back. If they say, ‘Okay, we
werewrong,youwereright,’whatdoyoudo?
That is the hundred-thousand-million-dollar
question.” He thinks he knows what should

be done but doesn’t think Germans are cap-
able of doing it. The idea he and his fellow
dissident German economists have cooked
up is to split the European Union in two for
financial purposes. One euro, a kind of
second-string currency, would be issued for,
and used by, the deadbeat coun-
tries—Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and so
on. The first-string euro would be used by
“thehomogenouscountries,theonesyoucan
rely on.” He lists these reliable countries:
Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Finland, and (he hesitates for a second over
this) France.
“Are you sure the French belong?”
“We discussed this,” he says seriously.
They decided that for social reasons you
couldn’t really exclude the French. It was just
too awkward.
As he presided over the Maastricht treaty,
which created the euro, the French prime
minister François Mitterrand is rumored to

have said privately that yoking Germany to
the rest of Europe in this way was sure to
lead to imbalances, and the imbalances were
certain to lead to some crisis, but by the time
the crisis struck he’d be dead and gone—and
others would sort it out. Even if Mitterrand
didn’t say exactly that, it’s the sort of thing
he should have said, as he surely thought it.
At the time it was obvious to a lot of people,
and not only Bundesbank governors, that
these countries did not belong together.
Butthenhowdidpeoplewhoseemasintel-

stench wafting from the big box. Nölling felt

white asparagus Germans take such pride in
growing. “We were talked into this under
false pretenses. Germans are, by and large,
gullible people. They trust and believe. They
liketo trust. Theyliketo believe.”
If the deputy finance minister has a sign on
his wall reminding him to see the point of
view of others, here is perhaps why. Others
do not behave as Germans do: others lie. In
this financial world of deceit Germans are
natives on a protected island who have not
been inoculated against the virus carried by
visitors. The same instincts that allowed
them to trust Wall Street bond salesmen also
allowed them to trust the French, when they
promisedtherewouldbenobailouts,andthe
Greeks, when they swore that their budget
was balanced. That is one theory. Another is
that they trusted so easily because they
didn’t care enough about the cost of being
wrong, as it came with certain benefits. For

It’s a device for flushing away the past. It’s
another Holocaust Memorial. The Greeks
may have German public opinion polls run-
ning against them, but deeper forces run in
their favor.
In any case, if you are obsessed with clean-
liness and order yet harbor a secret fascina-
tion with filth and chaos, you are bound to
get into some kind of trouble. There is no
such thing as clean without dirt. There is no
such thing as purity without impurity. The
interest in one implies an interest in the oth-
er. The young German woman who had driv-
en me back and forth across Germany exhib-
its interest in neither, and it’s hard to say
whether she is an exception or a new rule.
Still, she marches dutifully into the world’s
largest red-light district, seeking out a lot of
seedy-looking German men to ask them
where she might find a female mud wrestling
show. Even now she continues to find new

meaning in filth. “Scheisse glänzt nicht,
wenn man sie poliert: Shit won’t shine, even
if you polish it,” she says, as we pass the
Funky Pussy Club. “Scheissegal: it just
means ‘I don’t give a shit.’” She laughs.
“That’s an oxymoron in Germany, right?”
The night is young and the Reeperbahn is
hopping: it’s the closest thing I’ve seen in
Germany to a mob scene. Hawkers lean
against sex clubs and sift likely customers
from the passing crowds. Women who are al-
most pretty beckon men who are clearly
tempted. We pass several times the same
corporate logo, of a pair of stick figures en-
gaged in anal sex. Charlotte spots it and re-

TOO FAT TO FLY
O
n August 5, 2011, moments after the U.S.
government watched a rating agency lower
its credit rating for the first time in American
history, the market for U.S. Treasury bonds
soared. Four days later, the interest rates
paid by the U.S. government on its new ten-
year bonds had fallen to the lowest level on
record, 2.04 percent. The price of gold rose
right alongside the price of U.S. Treasury
bonds, but the prices of virtually all other
stocks and bonds in rich Western countries
went into a free fall. The net effect of a major

U.S. rating agency’s saying that the U.S. gov-
ernment was less likely than before to repay
its debts was to lower the cost of borrowing
for the U.S. government and to raise it for
everyone else. This told you a lot of what you
needed to know about the ability of the U.S.
government to live beyond its means: it had,
for the moment, a blank check. The shakier
the United States government appeared, up
to some faraway point, the more cheaply it
would be able to borrow. It wasn’t exposed
yet to the same vicious cycle that threatened
the financial life of European countries: a
moment of doubt leads to higher borrowing
costs, which leads to greater doubt, and even
higher borrowing costs, and so on until you
become Greece. The fear that the United
Statesmightactually notpaybackthemoney
it had borrowed was still unreal.
On December 19, 2010, the television news
program 60 Minutes aired a thirteen-minute
piece about U.S. state and local finances. The

correspondent Steve Kroft interviewed a
private Wall Street analyst named Meredith
Whitney, who, back in 2007, had gone from
being obscure to famous when she correctly
suggested that Citigroup’s losses in U.S.
subprime bonds were far bigger than anyone
imagined, and predicted the bank would be
forced to cut its dividend. The 60 Minutes
segment noted that U.S. state and local gov-
ernments faced a collective annual deficit of
roughly half a trillion dollars, and noted
another trillion-and-a-half-dollar gap
between what the governments owed retired
workers and the money they had on hand to
pay them. Whitney pointed out that even
these numbers were unreliable, and probably
optimistic, as the states did a poor job of
providing information about their finances
to the public. New Jersey governor Chris
Christie concurred with her and added, “At
this point, if it’s worse, what’s the differ-
ence?” The bill owed by American states to

                     PAGE 323

323/396
retired American workers was so large that it
couldn’t be paid, whatever the amount. At
the end of the piece Kroft asked Whitney
what she thought about the ability and will-
ingness of the American states to repay their
debts. She didn’t see a real risk that the
states would default, because the states had
the ability to push their problems down to
counties and cities. But at these lower levels
of government, where American life was
lived, she thought there would be serious
problems. “You could see fifty to a hundred
sizable defaults, maybe more,” she said. A
minute later Kroft returned to her to ask her
when people should start worrying about a
crisis in local finances. “It’ll be something to
worry about within the next twelve months,”
she said.
That prophecy turned out to be self-ful-
filling: people started worrying about U.S.
municipal financetheminutethewordswere
out of her mouth. The next day the

municipal bond market tanked. It kept fall-
ing right through the next month. It fell so
far, and her prediction received so much at-
tention, that money managers who had put
clients into municipal bonds felt compelled
to hire more people to analyze states and cit-
ies, to prove her wrong. (One of them called
it “The Meredith Whitney Municipal Bond
Analyst Full Employment Act.”) Inside the
financial world a new literature was born,
devoted to persuading readers that Meredith
Whitney didn’t know what she was talking
about. She was vulnerable to the charge: up
until the moment she appeared on 60
Minutes she had, so far as anyone knew, no
experience at all of U.S. municipal finance.
Many of the articles attacking her accused
her of making a very specific forecast—as
many as a hundred defaults within a
year!—that hadfailedtomaterialize. (Sample

FALL 60%.) The whirlwind thrown up by the
brief market panic sucked in everyone who
was anywhere near municipal finance. The
nonpartisan, dispassionate, sober-minded
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in
Washington, D.C., even released a statement
sayingthattherewasa“mistaken impression
that drastic and immediate measures are
needed to avoid an imminent fiscal melt-
down.” This was treated in news accounts as
a response to Meredith Whitney, as she was
the only one in sight who could be accused of
having made such a prediction.
But that’s not at all what she had said: her
words were being misrepresented so that her
message might be more easily attacked. “She
was referring to the complacency of the rat-
ings agencies and investment advisers who
say there is nothing to worry about,” said a
person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the tran-
scripts of the interview for me, to make sure
I had heard what I thought I had heard. “She

says there is something to worry about, and
it will be apparent to everyone in the next
twelve months.”
Whatever else she had done, Meredith
Whitney had found the pressure point in
Americanfinance:thefearthatAmericancit-
ies would not pay back the money they had
borrowed. The market for municipal bonds,
unlike the market for U.S. government
bonds, spooked easily. American cities and
states were susceptible to the same cycle of
doom that had forced Greece to seek help
from the International Monetary Fund. All it
took to create doubt, and raise borrowing
costs for states and cities, was for a woman
with no standing in the municipal bond mar-
ket to utter a few sentences on television.
That was the amazing thing: she had offered
nothing to back up her statement. She’d
written a massive, detailed report on state
and local finances, but no one except a hand-
ful of her clients had any idea what was in it.

“If I was a real nasty hedge fund guy,” one
hedge fund manager put it to me, “I’d sit
back and say, ‘This is a herd ofcattle that can
be stampeded.’”
What Meredith Whitney was trying to say
was more interesting than what she was ac-
cused of saying. She didn’t actually care all
that much about the municipal bond market,
or how many cities were likely to go bank-
rupt. The municipal bond market was a
dreary backwater. As she put it, “Who cares
about the stinking muni bond market?” The
only reason she had stumbled into that mar-
ket was that she had come to view the U.S.
national economy as a collection of regional
economies. To understand the regional eco-
nomies,shehadtounderstandhowstateand
local governments were likely to behave; and
to understand this she needed to understand
their finances. Thus she had spent two un-
likely years researching state and local fin-
ance. “I didn’t have a plan to do this,” she

said. “Not one of my clients asked for it. I
only looked at this because I needed to un-
derstand it myself. How it started was with a
question: how can GDP [gross domestic
product] estimates be so high when the
states that outperformed the U.S. economy
during the boom were now underperforming
the U.S. economy—and they were twenty-
two percent of that economy?” It was a good
question.
From 2002 to 2008, the states had piled
up debts right alongside their citizens’: their
level of indebtedness, as a group, had almost
doubled, and state spending had grown by
two-thirds. In that time they had also sys-
tematically underfunded their pension plans
andotherfutureliabilitiesbyatotalofnearly
$1.5 trillion. In response, perhaps, the pen-
sion money that they had set aside was in-
vested in ever-riskier assets. In 1980 only 23
percent of state pension money had been in-
vested in the stock market; by 2008 the

number had risen to 60 percent. To top it all
off, these pension funds were pretty much all
assuming they could earn 8 percent on the
money they had to invest, at a time when the
Federal Reserve was promising to keep in-
terest rates at zero. Toss in underfunded
health care plans, a reduction in federal dol-
lars available to the states, and the depres-
sion in tax revenues caused by a soft eco-
nomy,andyouwerelookingatmulti-trillion-
dollar holes that could only be dealt with in
one of two ways—massive cutbacks on public
services or a default—or both. She thought
default unlikely, at least at the state level, be-
cause the state could bleed the cities of
money to pay off its bonds. The cities were
where the pain would be felt most intensely.
“The scary thing about state treasurers,” she
said “is that they don’t know the financial
situation in their own municipalities.”
“How do you know that?”
“Because I asked them!”

All states may have been created equal, but
they were equal no longer. The states that
had enjoyed the biggest boom were now fa-
cing the biggest busts. “How does the United
States emerge from the credit crisis?” Whit-
ney asked herself. “I was convinced—because
the credit crisis had been so different from
region to region—that it would emerge with
new regional strengths and weaknesses.
Companies are more likely to flourish in the
stronger states; the individuals will go to
where the jobs are. Ultimately, the people
will follow the companies.” The country, she
thought, might organize itself increasingly
into zones of financial security and zones of
financial crisis. And the more clearly people
understood which zones were which, the
more friction there would be between the
two. (“Indiana is going to be like, ‘NFW I’m
bailing out New Jersey.’”) As more and more
people grasped which places had serious fin-
ancial problems and which did not, the

problems would only increase. “Those who
have money and can move do so,” Whitney
wrote in her report to her Wall Street clients,
“those without money and who cannot move
do not, and ultimately rely more on state and
local assistance. It becomes effectively a
‘tragedy of the commons.’”
The point of Meredith Whitney’s investiga-
tion, in her mind, was not to predict defaults
inthemunicipal bondmarket. Itwastocom-
pare the states to each other so that they
might be ranked. She wanted to get a sense
of who in America was likely to play the role
of the Greeks, and who the Germans. Of who
was strong, and who weak. In the process
she had, in effect, unearthed America’s scari-
est financial places.
“So what’s the scariest state?” I asked her.
She only had to think for about two
seconds.
“California.”

pedaled a five-thousand-dollar titanium-
frame mountain bike rented in anxiety the
previous evening down the Santa Monica
beach road to the corner where Arnold Sch-
warzenegger had asked me to meet him. He
turned up right on time, driving a black Ca-
dillac SUV with a handful of crappy old ja-
lopy bikes racked to the back. I wore the
closest I could find to actual bicycle gear; he
wore a green fleece, shorts, and soft beige
slipperlike shoes that suggested both a sur-
prising indifference to his own appearance
and a security in his own manhood. His hair
was still vaguely in a shape left by a pillow,
and his eyelids drooped, though he swore
he’d been up for an hour and a half reading
newspapers. After reading the newspapers,
thisiswhattheformergovernorofCalifornia

wind-induced tears course down his cheeks.
He’s got to be one of the world’s most re-

nomic adviser, David Crane, and his media
adviser, Adam Mendelsohn, who came along
for the ride just because it sounded fun, are
now somewhere far behind him. Anyone
paying attention would think, That guy
might look like Arnold but it can’t possibly
be Arnold because Arnold would never be
out alone on a bike at seven in the morning,
trying to commit suicide. It isn’t until he is
forced to stop at a red light that he makes
meaningful contact with the public. A wo-
man pushing a baby stroller and talking on a
cell phone crosses the street right in front of
him, and does a double take. “Oh . . . my . . .
God,” she gasps into her phone. “It’s Bill
Clinton!” She’s not ten feet away but she
keeps talking to the phone, as if the man is
unreal. “I’m here with Bill Clinton.”
“It’s one of those guys who has had a sex
scandal,” says Arnold, smiling.

him from self-absorption, aside from a nat-
ural curiosity, is a genuine lack of interest in
personal reflection. He lives the same way he
rides his bike, paying far more attention to
what’s ahead than what’s behind. In office,

ing, but he now says he didn’t so much as

stone house that now just looks old and
bleak and empty. The wall is what interests
him, because he built it, forty-three years
ago, right after he had arrived and started to
train on Muscle Beach. “Franco [Columbu,

there was no money. Here we were world
champions of this little subculture, and we
did this to eat. Franco ran the business. I
mixed the cement and knocked things down
with the sledgehammer.”
Before he stumbled while running downhill
with a refrigerator strapped to his back,
Columbu was the front-runner in the 1977
contest for the title of the World’s Strongest
Man; so there was some distinction in being
hired by his operation, as Schwarzenegger
was, to be the muscle. They had a routine.
Franco would play the unreliable Italian,
Arnold the sober German. Before they cut
any deal they’d scream at each other in Ger-
man in front of the customer until the cus-
tomer would finally ask what was going on.
Arnold would turn to the customer and ex-
plain, Oh, he’s Italian, and you know how
they are. He wants to charge you more, but
I think we can do it cheaply.

Schwarzenegger would then name a not-so-
cheap price. “And the customer,” he says
now, laughing, “he would always say,
‘Arnold, you’re such a nice guy! So honest!’ It
was selling, you know.”
He surveys his handiwork. “It’ll be here for
a thousand years,” he says, then points out
some erosion on the top. “I said to Franco we
ought to come back and fix the top. You
know, to show it was guaranteed for life.”

obvious question.

“As a boy,” I said, taking another tack, “did
you believe you’d lead something other than
an ordinary life?”
“Yes.” He didn’t miss a beat.
“Why?”
“I don’t know.”
“No one has had this kind of crazy, wild
ride,” he says, as we speed away from the
brick wall, but in a tone that suggests the
ride was an accident. “I was influenced a lot
by America,” he said. “The giant six-lane
highways, theEmpire StateBuilding, therisk
taking.” He still remembers vividly the
America he heard and read about as a boy in
Austria: everything about it was big. The
only reason he set out to grow himself some
big muscles was that he thought it might be a
ticket to America.

says, dodging vagrants and joggers along the

of the recall madness, Terminator 3: Rise of
the Machines opened. As the movie’s leading
machine he was expected to appear on The
Tonight Show to promote it. En route he ex-
perienced a familiar impulse—the impulse to
do something out of the ordinary. “I just
thought, This will freak everyone out,” he
says. “It’ll be so funny. I’ll announce that I
am running. I told Leno I was running. And
two months later I was governor.” He looks
over at me, pedaling as fast as I can to keep
up with him, and laughs. “What the fuck is
that?”

We’re now off the beach and on the surface
roads, and the traffic is already heavy. He
veers left, across four lanes of traffic, arrives
on the other side, and says, “All these people
are asking me, ‘What’s your plan? Who’s on
your staff?’ I didn’t have a plan. I didn’t have
a staff. I wasn’t running until I went on Jay
Leno.”
His view of his seven years trying to run
the state of California, like the views of his
closest associates, can be summarized as fol-
lows. He came to power accidentally, but not
withoutideasaboutwhathewantedtodo.At
his core he thought government had become
more problem than solution: an institution
run less for the benefit of the people than for
the benefit of politicians and other public
employees. He behaved pretty much as
Americans seem to imagine the ideal politi-
cian should behave: he made bold decisions
without looking at polls; he didn’t sell favors;
he treated his opponents fairly; he was quick

to acknowledge his mistakes and to learn
from them, and so on. He was the rare elec-
ted official who believed, with some reason,
that he had nothing to lose, and behaved ac-
cordingly. When presented with the chance
to pursue an agenda that violated his own
narrow political self-interest for the sake of
the public interest, he tended to leap at it.
“There were alotoftimes when wesaid, ‘You
just can’t do that,’ says his former chief of
staff, Susan Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat,
whose hiring was one of those things a Re-
publican governor was not supposed to do.
“He was always like, ‘I don’t care.’ Ninety
percent of the time it was a good thing.”
Two years into his tenure, in mid-2005,
he’d tried everything he could think of to
persuade individual California state legislat-
ors to vote against the short-term desires of
their constituents for the greater long-term
good of all. “To me there were shocking mo-
ments,” he says. Having sped past a DO NOT

ENTER sign, we are now flying through inter-
sections without pausing. I can’t help but no-
tice that, if we weren’t breaking the law by
going the wrong way down a one-way street,
we’d be breaking the law by running stop
signs. “When you want to do pension reform
for the prison guards,” he says, “and all of a
sudden the Republicans are all lined up
against you. It was really incredible and it
happened over and over: people would say to
me, ‘Yes, this is the best idea! I would love to
vote for it! But if I vote for it some interest
group is going to be angry with me, so I
won’t do it.’ I couldn’t believe people could
actually say that. You have soldiers dying in
Iraq and Afghanistan, and they didn’t want
to risk their political lives by doing the right
thing.”
He came into office with boundless faith in
the American people—after all, they had
elected him—and figured hecouldalways ap-
peal directly to them. That was his trump

card, and he played it. In November 2005 he
called a special election that sought votes on
four reforms: limiting state spending, put-
ting an end to the gerrymandering of legis-
lative districts, limiting public employee uni-
on spending on elections, and lengthening
the time it took for public school teachers to
get tenure. All four propositions addressed,
directly or indirectly, the state’s large and
growing financial mess. All four were de-
feated; the votes weren’t even close. From
then until the end of his time in office he was
effectively gelded: the legislators now knew
that the people who had elected them to be-
have exactly the way they were already be-
having were not going to undermine them
when appealed to directly. The people of
California mightbeirresponsible, butatleast
they were consistent.
A compelling book called California
Crackup describes this problem more gener-
ally. It’s written by a pair of journalists and

nonpartisan think tank scholars, Joe
Mathews and Mark Paul, and they explain,
among other things, why Arnold Schwar-
zenegger’s experience as governor was going
to be unlike any other experience in his ca-
reer: he was never going to win. California
had organized itself, not accidentally, into
highly partisan legislative districts. It elected
highly partisan people to office and then re-
quired these people to reach a two-thirds
majority toenact any new tax or meddle with
big spending decisions. On the off chance
that they found some common ground, it
could be pulled out from under them by
voters through the initiative process. Throw
in term limits—no elected official now serves
in California government long enough to
fully understand it—and you have a recipe
for generating maximum contempt for elec-
ted officials. Politicians are elected to get
things done and are prevented by the system
from doing it, leading the people to grow

even more disgusted with them. “The vicious
cycle of contempt,” as Mark Paul calls it.
California state government was designed
mainly to maximize the likelihood that
voters will continue to despise the people
they elect.
But when you look below the surface, he
adds, the system is actually very good at giv-
ing Californians what they want. “What all
the polls show,” says Paul, “is that people
want services and not to pay for them. And
that’s exactly what they have now got.” As
much as they claimed to despise their gov-
ernment, the citizens of California shared its
defining trait: a need for debt. The average
Californian, in 2011, had debts of $78,000
against an income of $43,000. The behavior
was unsustainable, but, in its way, for the
people, it works brilliantly. For their leaders,
even in the short term, it works less well.
They ride into office on great false hopes and

quickly discover they can do nothing to justi-
fy those hopes.
In Paul’s view, Arnold Schwarzenegger had
been the best test to date of the notion that
the problem with California politics was per-
sonal; that all the system needed to fix itself
wasanindependent-minded leaderwillingto
rise above petty politics and exert the will of
the people. “The recall was, in and of itself,
an effort by the people to say that a new gov-
ernor—a different person—could solve the
problem,” says Paul. “He tried every differ-
ent way of dealing with the crisis in services.
He tried to act like a Republican. He tried to
act like a Democrat. He tried making nice
with the legislature. When that didn’t work
he called them girlie men. When that didn’t
work he went directly to the people. And the
people voted against his proposals.”
The experiment hadn’t been a complete
failure. As governor, Schwarzenegger was
able to accomplish a few important

things—reforming worker compensation, en-
abling open primaries, and, at the very end,
ensuring that legislative districts would be
drawn by an impartial committee rather
than by the legislature. But on most issues,
and on virtually everything having to do with
how the state raised and spent money, he
lost. In his first term Schwarzenegger had set
out to cut spending and found he could cut
only the things that the state actually
needed. Near the end of his second term, he
managed to pass a slight tax increase, after
he talked four Republicans into creating the
supermajority necessary for doing so. Every
one of them lost his seat in the next election.
He’d taken office in 2003 with approval rat-
ings pushing 70 percent and what appeared
to be a mandate to fix California’s money
problems; he’d left in 2011 with approval rat-
ings below 25 percent, having fixed very
little. “I was operating under the common
sense kind of thing,” he says now. “It was the

voters who recalled Gray Davis. It was the
voters who elected me. So it will be the
voters who hand me the tools to do the job.
But the other side was successful enough for
the voters to take the tools away.”
David Crane, his economic adviser—at that
moment, rapidly receding into the dis-
tance—could itemize the result: a long list of
depressing government financial statistics.
The pensions of state employees ate up twice
as much of the budget when Schwarzenegger
left office as they did when he arrived, for in-
stance. The officially recognized gap between
what the state would owe its workers and
what it had on hand to pay them was roughly
$105 billion, but that, thanks to accounting
gimmicks, was probably only about half the
real number. “This year the state will directly
spend thirty-two billion dollars on employee
pay and benefits, up sixty-five percent over
the past ten years,” says Crane later. “Com-
pare that to state spending on higher

education [down 5 percent], health and hu-
man services [up just 5 percent], and parks
and recreation [flat], all crowded out in large
part by fast-rising employment costs.” Crane
was a lifelong Democrat with no particular
hostility to government. But the more he’d
looked into the details, the more shocking he
found them to be. In 2010, for instance, the
state spent $6 billion on fewer than 30,000
guards and other prison system employees.
A prison guard who started his career at the
age of forty-five could retire after five years
with a pension that very nearly equaled his
former salary. The head parole psychiatrist
for the California prison system was Califor-
nia’s highest-paid public employee; in 2010
he’d made $838,706. The same fiscal year
that the state spent $6 billion on prisons, it
had invested just $4.7 billion in its higher
education—that is, 33 campuses with
670,000 students. Over the past thirty years
the state’s share of the budget for the

University of California had fallen from 30
percent to 11 percent, and it was about to fall
a lot more. In 1980 a Cal student paid $776 a
year in tuition; in 2011 he would pay
$13,218. Everywhere you turned, the long-
term future of the state was being sacrificed.
This same set of facts, and the narrative it
suggested, would throw an ordinary man in-
to depression. He might conclude that he
lived in a society that was ungovernable.
After seven years of trying and mostly failing
to run California, Schwarzenegger is per-
suasively not depressed. “You have to realize
the thing was so much fun!” he says. “We
had a great time! There were times of frus-
tration. There were times of disappointment.
But if you want to live rather than just exist,
you want the drama.” As we roll to a stop
very near the place on the beach where he
began his American bodybuilding career, he
says, “You have to step back and say, ‘I was
elected under odd circumstances. And I’m

going out in odd circumstances.’ You can’t
have it both ways. You can’t be a spoiled
brat.”
The odd circumstances were the never-
ending financial crises. He’d come to power
in thebustafter theInternet bubble;he’dleft
in the bust after the housing bubble. Before
and after our bike ride, I had sat down with
him to get his view of this second event. It
was in the middle of 2007, he said, when he
first noticed something was not quite right in
the California economy. He’d been finishing
up budget negotiations and arrived at a
number, however phony, where the budget
could be declared balanced. An aide walked
into his office to give him a heads-up: the tax
receipts for that month were less than expec-
ted. “We were all of a sudden short three
hundred million dollars in revenue for the
month,” says Schwarzenegger. “I somehow
felt, Uh-oh. Because there was something in
the air.” Soon after that he visited the George

W. Bush White House, where he gave a talk
that was, as ever, upbeat. “At the end of it
this guy—he was the guy who was in charge
of housing, I forgot the name. Great guy. For
some reason or other he was very honest
with me. I don’t know why. He probably
didn’t think I’d go out and blab, which I
didn’t. He says, ‘That was a great speech you
gave, but we’re heading to a major problem.’
I said, ‘What do you mean?’ He said, ‘I
looked at some of the numbers, and it’s go-
ingtobeugly.’That’sallhesaid.Hewouldn’t
elaborate.” A housing price decline in the
United States meant a housing price collapse
in California; and a housing price collapse in
California meant an economic collapse, and
a decline in tax revenues. “The next month
our revenues came in short six hundred mil-
lion dollars. By December we were short a
billion.”
The hope that California would generate
the tax revenues needed to pay for even

newly reduced services vanished. “This crisis
consumed the last three years,” says Schwar-
zenegger. “All of a sudden you are pissing off
everyone. The parks don’t get money and all
of a sudden everyone is in love with parks.
People pay attention so much to how does it
affect them immediately: that’s just the way
the human mind works.”

vices affected people immediately would not

sitting in Sacramento. As Meredith Whitney
had pointed out, the state has great ability to
paper over its financial problems by pushing
them down to cities. In May 2011, to take
just the most cinematic of countless ex-
amples, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a
ruling that California’s prison conditions
constituted cruel and unusual punishment
and violated the Eighth Amendment. The
ruling ordered the state either to build more
prisons or to release thirty thousand

inmates. The state—still overpaying its pris-
on guards—has chosen to release the prison-
ers and, with them, their social cost. There
will probably be more crime, and heavier de-
pendency on local public services, but it
must be paid for by local communities. At
some point in our talks I had asked Schwar-
zenegger how much time he had spent, as
governor, grappling with the on-the-ground
local implications of the big state crisis. The
question pretty clearly bored him. “I’m not
into thelocalstuff,” he’dsaid. “Iwasborn for
the world.”
ABOUTANHOUR into the weekly meeting of the
San Jose City Council I find myself wishing
that I, too, was born for the world. A hun-
dred citizens yawn and text as the council
honors National Farmer’s Market Week; the
few people who seemed to be paying atten-
tion get up and leave after the honor is be-
stowed. The council commemorates August 7
as Assyrian Martyrs Day, “honoring the

massacre of three thousand people in August
1933, and recognizing 2,000 years of perse-
cution of Assyrian Christians.” Maybe thirty
people turn their attention from their cell
phones to the ceremony but then they, too,
rise and exit the chamber. A mere handful of
people are left to hear the San Jose city man-
ager offer the latest bleak financial news: the
state of California was clawing back tens of
millions of dollars more, and “one hundred
and forty employees have been separated
from the city.” (New times call for new eu-
phemisms.) A pollster presents his finding
that, no matter how the question is phrased,
the citizens of San Jose are unlikely to ap-
prove any ballot measure that raises taxes. A
numbers guy gets to his feet and explains
that the investment returns in the city’s pen-
sion plan are not likely to be anything like as
high as was assumed. In addition to there
not being enough money in this particular
pot to begin with, the pot is failing to expand

between what the city’s employees are en-
titled to and what will exist is even greater
than previously imagined. The council then
votes to postpone, for six weeks, a vote on
whether to declare the city’s budget a “public
emergency,” and thus to give to the mayor,
Chuck Reed, new powers.
In between each motion an obese man not
so much dressed as enshrouded in blue jean
overalls maximizes his right to be heard for
five minutes on every subject: over and again
he rises from the front row of the audience,
waddles to the podium, and delivers
sophisticated-sounding but incomprehens-
ible critiques of everything. “The absolute re-
duction in competence of government is pre-
dicated on what happened today . . . ”
The relationship between the people and
their money in California is such that you
can pluck almost any city at random and
enter a crisis. San Jose has the highest per

States, after New York. It has the highest
credit rating of any city in California with a
population over 250,000. It is one of the few
cities in America with a triple-A rating from
Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, but only be-
cause its bondholders have the power to
compel the city to levy a tax on property
owners to pay off the bonds. The city itself is
not all that far from being bankrupt.
It’s late afternoon when I meet Mayor
Chuck Reed, in his office at the top of city
hall tower. The crowd below has just begun
to chant. The public employees, as usual, are
protesting him. Reed is so used to it that he
hardly notices. He’s a former air force fighter
pilot and Vietnam veteran with an intellectu-
al bent and the clipped manner of a mid-
western farmer. He has a master’s degree
from Princeton, a law degree from Stanford,
and a lifelong interest in public policy. Still,
he presents less as the mayor of a big city in

California than as a hard-bitten, upstanding
sheriff of a small town who doesn’t want any
trouble. Elected to the city council in 2000,
he became mayor six years later; in 2010, he
was reelected with 77 percent of the vote.
He’s a Democrat, but at this point it doesn’t
much matter which party he belongs to, or
what his ideological leanings are, or for that
matter how popular he is with the people of
San Jose. He’s got a problem so big that it
overwhelms ordinary politics: the city owes
so much more money than it can afford to
pay to its employees that it could cut its
debts in half and still wind up broke. “I did a
calculation of cost per public employee,” he
says, as we settle in. “We’re not as bad as
Greece, I don’t think.”
The problem, he explains, predates the
mostrecentfinancial crisis.“Hell,Iwashere.
I know how it started. It started in the 1990s
with the Internet boom. We live near rich
people, so we thought we were rich.” San

Jose’s budget, like the budget of any city,
turns on the pay of public safety workers: the
police and firefighters now eat 75 percent of
all discretionary spending. The Internet
boom created both great expectations for
public employees and tax revenues to meet
them. In its negotiations with unions the city
was required to submit to binding arbitra-
tion, which works for police officers and fire-
fighters just as it does for Major League
Baseball players. Each side of any pay dis-
pute makes its best offer, and a putatively
neutral judge picks one of them. There is no
meeting in the middle: the judge simply
rulesforonesideortheother.Eachsidethus
has an incentive to be reasonable, for the less
reasonable they are, the less likely it is that
the judge will favor their proposal. The prob-
lem with binding arbitration for police of-
ficers and firefighters, says Reed, is that the
judgesarenotneutral.“Theytendtobelabor
lawyers who favor the unions,” he says, “and

so the city does anything it can to avoid the
process.” And what politician wants to spat
publicly with police officers and firefighters?
Over the past decade the city of San Jose
had repeatedly caved to the demands of its
public safety unions. In practice this meant
that when the police or fire department of
any neighboring city struck a better deal for
itself, it became a fresh argument for im-
proving the pay of San Jose police and fire.
The effect was to make the sweetest deal cut
by public safety workers with any city in
northern California the starting point for the
next round of negotiations for every other
city.Thedepartmentsalsousedeachotherto
score debating points. For instance, back in
2002, the San Jose police union cut a three-
yeardealthatraisedpoliceofficers’payby10
percent over the contract. Soon afterward,
the San Jose firefighters cut a better deal for
themselves, including a pay raise of 23 per-
cent. The police felt robbed and complained

mightily until the city council crafted a deal
that handed them 5 percent more pay in ex-
change for training to fight terrorists. “We
got famous for our antiterrorist training
pay,” explains one city official. Eventually
the antiterrorist training stopped; the police
just kept the extra pay, with benefits. “Our
police and firefighters will earn more in re-
tirement than they did when they were work-
ing,” says Reed. “There used to be an argu-
ment that you have to give us money or we
can’t afford to live in the city. Now the more
youpaythemthelesslikelytheyaretolivein
the city, because they can afford to leave. It’s
staggering. When did we go from giving
people sick leave to letting them accumulate
it and cash it in for hundreds of thousands of
dollars when they are done working? There’s
a corruption here. It’s not just a financial
corruption. It’sacorruption oftheattitude of
public service.”

When he was elected to the city council in
2000, Reed says, “I hadn’t even thought
about pensions. I can’t say I said, ‘Here is my
plan.’ I never thought about this stuff. It nev-
er came up.” It wasn’t until San Diego flirted
with bankruptcy, in 2002, that he wondered
about San Jose’s finances. He began to in-
vestigate the matter. “That’s when I realized
there were big problems,” he says. “That’s
when I started paying attention. That’s when
I started asking questions: could it happen
here? It’s like the housing bubble and the In-
ternet bubble. There were people around
who were writing about it. It’s not that there
aren’t people telling us that this is crazy. It’s
that you refuse to believe that you are crazy.”
He hands me a chart. It shows that the
city’s pension costs when he first became in-
terested in the subject were projected to run
$73 million a year. This year they would be
$245 million: pension and health costs of re-
tired workers now are more than half the

budget. In three years’ time pension costs
alone would come to $400 million, though
“if you were to adjust for real-life expectancy
it is more like six hundred fifty million dol-
lars.” Legally obliged to meet these costs, the
city can respond only by cutting elsewhere.
As a result, San Jose, once run by 7,450 city
workers, was now being run by 5,400 city
workers. The city was back to staffing levels
of 1988, when it had a quarter of a million
fewer residents to service. The remaining
workers had taken a 10 percent pay cut; yet
even that was not enough to offset the in-
crease in the city’s pension liability. The city
had closed its libraries three days a week. It
had cut back servicing its parks. It had re-
frained from opening a brand-new com-
munity center built before the housing bust,
because it couldn’t pay to staff the place. For
the first time in history it had laid off police
officers and firefighters.

By 2014, Reed had calculated, a city of a
million people, the tenth largest city in the
United States, would be serviced by 1,600
public workers. “There is no way to run a city
with that level of staffing,” he said. “You start
to ask: What is a city? Why do we bother to
live together? But that’s just the start.” The
problem was going to grow worse until, as he
put it, “you get to one.” A single employee to
service the entire city, presumably with a fo-
cus on paying pensions. “I don’t know how
far out you have to go until you get to one,”
said Reed, “but it isn’t all that far.” At that
point, ifnotbefore,thecitywouldbenothing
more than a vehicle to pay the retirement
costs of its former workers. The only clear
solution was if former city workers up and
died, soon. But former city workers were,
blessedly, living longer than ever.
This wasn’t a hypothetical scary situation,
said Reed. “It’s a mathematical inevitability.”
In spirit it reminded me of Bernard Madoff’s

investment business. Anyone who looked at
Madoff’s returns and understood them could
see he was running a Ponzi scheme; only one
person who had understood them bothered
to blow the whistle, and no one listened to
him. (See No One Would Listen: A True Fin-
ancial Thriller,by Harry Markopolos.)
In his negotiations with the unions, the
mayor has gotten nowhere. “I understand
the police and firefighters,” he says. “They
think, We’re the most important, and every-
one else goes [gets fired] first.” The police
union recently suggested to the mayor that
he close the libraries for the other four days.
“We looked into that,” Reed says. “If you
close the libraries an extra day you pay for
twenty or thirty cops.” Adding twenty more
police officers for a year wouldn’t solve any-
thing. The cops who were spared this year
would be axed next, in response to the soar-
ing costs of the pensions of city workers who
already had retired. On the other side of the

inequality is the taxpayer of San Jose, who
has no interest in paying more than he
already does. “It’s not that we’re insolvent
and can’t pay our bills,” says Reed. “It’s
about willingness.”
I ask him what the chances were that, in
this pinch, he could raise taxes. He holds up
a thumb and index finger: zero. He’s recently
coined a phrase, he says: “service-level
insolvency.” Service-level insolvency means
that the expensive community center that
has been built and named cannot be opened.
It means closing libraries three days a week.
It isn’t financial bankruptcy; it’s cultural
bankruptcy.
“How on earth did this happen?” I ask him.
“The only way I can explain it,” he says, “is
that they got the money because it was
there.” But he has another way to explain it,
and in a moment he offers it up.
“I think we’ve suffered from a series of
mass delusions,” he says.

I didn’t completely understand what he
meant, and said so.
“We’re all going to be rich,” he says. “We’re
all going to live forever. All the forces in the
state are lined up to preserve the status quo.
To preserve the delusion. And here—this
place—is where the reality hits.”
On the way back to the elevators I chatted
with two of Mayor Reed’s aides. He’d men-
tioned to me that as bad as they might think
they have it in San Jose, a lot of other Amer-
ican cities have it worse. “I count my bless-
ings when I talk to the mayors of other cit-
ies,” he’d said.
“Whichcitydoyoupitymost?”Iasked, just
before the elevator doors closed.
The aides laughed and in unison said,
“Vallejo!”

abandoned businesses, and all traffic lights
are set to permanently blink, which is a
formality as there are no longer any cops to
police the streets. Vallejo is the one city in
the Bay Area where you can park anywhere
and not worry about getting a ticket, because
there are no meter maids, either. The win-
dows of city hall are dark but its front porch
is a hive of activity. A young man in a back-
wards baseball cap, sunglasses, and a new
pair of Nike sneakers stands on a low wall
and calls out an address:
“Nine hundred Cambridge Drive,” he says.
“In Benicia.”
The people in the crowd below instantly
begin bidding. From 2006 to 2010 the value
of Vallejo real estate fell 66 percent. One in
sixteen homes in the city are in foreclosure.
This is apparently the fire sale, but the char-
acters involved are so shady and furtive that
I can hardly believe it. I stop to ask what’s
going on, but the bidders don’t want to talk.

“Why would I tell you anything?” says a guy
sitting in a Coleman folding chair. He obvi-

The lobby of city hall is completely empty.
There’s a receptionist’s desk but no recep-
tionist. Instead, there’s a sign: TO

new city manager, Phil Batchelor, but when I

appears and leads me to Batchelor himself.
He’s in his sixties and, oddly enough, a pub-
lished author. He’s written one book on how
to raise children and another on how to face
death. Both deliver an overtly Christian mes-
sage, but he doesn’t come across as evangel-
ical; he comes across as sensible, and a little
weary. His day job, before he retired, was
running cities with financial difficulties. He

came out of retirement to take this job, but
only after the city council had asked him a
few times. “The more you say no, the more
determined they are to get you,” he says. His
chief demand was not financial but social:
he’donlytakethejobifthepeopleonthecity
council ceased being nasty to one another
and behaved civilly. He actually got that in
writing, and they’ve kept their end of the
bargain.“I’vebeeninalotofplacesthathave
been in a lot of trouble but I’ve never seen
anything like this,” he says. He then lays out
what he finds unusual, beginning with the
staffing levels. He’s now running the city,
and he has a staff of one: I just met her.
“When she goes out to the bathroom she has
to lock the door,” he says, “because I’m in
meetings, and we have no one else.”
Back in 2008, unable to come to terms
with its many creditors, Vallejo had declared
bankruptcy. Eighty percent of the city’s
budget—and the lion’s share of the claims

that had thrown it into bankruptcy—were
wrapped up in the pay and benefits of public
safety workers. Relations between the police
andthefirefighters, ontheonehand,andthe
citizens, on the other, were at historic lows.
The public safety workers thought that the
city was out to screw them on their con-
tracts; the citizenry thought that the public
safetyworkerswereusingfearasatooltoex-
tort money from them. The local joke was
that “P.D.” stands for “Pay or Die.” The city
council meetings had become exercises in
outrage: atone, acitizen arrived and tosseda
severed pig’s head onto the floor. “There’s no

office did so to say they no longer felt safe in
their own homes. All other city services had
been reduced effectively to zero. “Do you
know that some cities actually pave their
streets?” says Batchelor. “That’s not here.”
I notice on his shelf a copy of Fortune
magazine, with Meredith Whitney on the
cover. And as he talked about the bankrupt-
ing of Vallejo I realized that I had heard this
story before, or a private-sector version of it.
The people who had power in the society,
and were charged with saving it from itself,
had instead bled the society to death. The
problem with police officers and firefighters
isn’t a public-sector problem; it isn’t a prob-
lem with government; it’s a problem with the
entire society. It’s what happened on Wall
Street in the run-up to the subprime crisis.
It’s a problem of people taking what they
can, just because they can, without regard to
the larger social consequences. It’s not just a
coincidence that the debts of cities and states

spun out of control at the same time as the
debts of individual Americans. Alone in a
dark room with a pile of money, Americans
knew exactly what they wanted to do, from
the top of the society to the bottom. They’d
been conditioned to grab as much as they
could, without thinking about the long-term
consequences. Afterward, the people on Wall
Street would privately bemoan the low mor-
als of the American people who walked away
from their subprime loans, and theAmerican
people would express outrage at the Wall
Street people who paid themselves a fortune
to design the bad loans.
Having failed to persuade its public safety
workers that it could not afford to make
them rich, the city of Vallejo, California, had
hit bottom: it could fall no lower. “My ap-
proach has been I don’t care who is to
blame,” Batchelor said. “We needed to
change.” When I met him, a few months
after he had taken the job, he was still trying

to resolve a narrow financial dispute: the city
had 1,013 claimants with half a billion dol-
lars in claims but only $6 million to dole out
to them. They were survivors of a shipwreck
on a life raft with limited provisions. His job,
as he saw it, was to persuade them that the
only chance of survival was to work together.
He didn’t view the city’s main problem as
financial: the financial problems were the
symptom. The disease was the culture. Just a
few weeks earlier, he had sent a memo to the
remaining city staff—the city council, the
mayor, the public safety workers. The central
message was that if you want to fix this place
you need to change how you behave, each
and every one of you. “It’s got to be about the
people,” he said. “Teach them respect for
each other, integrity and how to strive for ex-
cellence. Cultures change. But people need to
want to change. People convinced against
their will are of the same opinion still.”

“How do you change the culture of an en-
tire city?” I asked him.
“First of all we look internally,” he said.
THE ROAD OUT of Vallejo passes directly
through the office of Dr. Peter Whybrow, a
British neuroscientist at UCLA with a theory
about American life. He thinks the dysfunc-
tion in America’s society is a by-product of
America’s success. In academic papers and a
popular book, American Mania, Whybrow
argues, in effect, that human beings are
neurologically ill-designed to be modern
Americans. The human brain evolved over
hundreds of thousands of years in an envir-
onment defined by scarcity. It was not de-
signed, at least originally, for an environ-
ment of extreme abundance. “Human beings
are wandering around with brains that are
fabulously limited,” he says cheerfully.
“We’ve got the core of the average lizard.”
Wrapped around this reptilian core, he ex-
plains, is a mammalian layer (associated

with maternal concern and social interac-
tion),andaroundthatiswrappedathirdlay-
er, which enables feats of memory and the
capacity for abstract thought. “The only
problem,” he says, “is our passions are still
driven bythe lizard core. We are set up to ac-
quire as much as we can of things we per-
ceive as scarce, particularly sex, safety, and
food.” Even a person on a diet who sensibly
avoids coming face-to-face with a piece of
chocolate cake will find it hard to control
himself if the chocolate cake somehow finds
him. Every pastry chef in America un-
derstands this, and now neuroscience does,
too. “When faced with abundance, the
brain’s ancient reward pathways are difficult
to suppress,” says Whybrow. “In that mo-
ment the value of eating the chocolate cake
exceeds the value of the diet. We cannot
think down the road when we are faced with
the chocolate cake.”

The richest society the world has ever seen
has grown rich by devising better and better
ways to give people what they want. The ef-
fect on the brain of lots of instant gratifica-
tion is something like the effect on the right
hand of cutting off the left: the more the liz-
ard core is used the more dominant it be-
comes. “What we’re doing is minimizing the
use of the part of the brain that lizards don’t
have,” says Whybrow. “We’ve created
physiological dysfunction. We have lost the
ability to self-regulate, at all levels of the so-
ciety. The five million dollars you get paid at
Goldman Sachs if you do whatever they ask
you to do—that is the chocolate cake
upgraded.”
The succession of financial bubbles, and
the amassing of personal and public debt,
Whybrow views as simply an expression of
the lizard-brained way of life. A color-coded
map of American personal indebtedness
could be laid on top of the Centers for

Everywhere you turn you see Americans sac-
rifice their long-term interests for a short-
term reward.
What happens when a society loses its abil-
ity to self-regulate, and insists on sacrificing
its long-term self-interest for short-term re-
wards? How does the story end? “We could
regulate ourselves if we chose to think about
it,” Whybrow says. “But it does not appear
that is what we are going to do.” Apart from
that remote possibility, Whybrow imagines
two possible outcomes. The first he illus-
trates with a true story, which might be
called the parable of the pheasant. Last
spring, on sabbatical at the University of

Oxford, he was surprised to discover that he
was able to rent an apartment inside Blen-
heim Palace, the Churchill family home. The
previous winter at Blenheim had been harsh,
and the pheasant hunters had been efficient;
as a result, just a single pheasant had sur-
vived in the palace gardens. This bird had
gained total control of a newly seeded field.
Its intake of food, normally regulated by its
environment, was now entirely unregulated:
it could eat all it wanted, and it did. The
pheasant grew so large that when other birds
challenged it for seed, it would simply fright-
en them away. The fat pheasant became a
tourist attraction and even acquired a name:
Henry. “Henry was the biggest pheasant any-
one had ever seen,” says Whybrow. “Even
after he got fat, he just ate and ate.” It didn’t
take long before Henry was obese. He could
still eat as much as he wanted, but he could
no longer fly. Then one day he was gone: a
fox ate him.

The other possible outcome was only
slightly more hopeful: to hit bottom. To real-
ize what has happened to us, because we
have no other choice. “If we refuse to regu-
late ourselves, the only regulators are our en-
vironment,” says Whybrow, “and the way
that environment deprives us.” For meaning-
ful change to occur, in other words, we need
the environment to administer the necessary
level of pain.
IN AUGUST 2011, the same week that Standard
& Poor’s downgraded the debt of the United
States government, a judge approved the
bankruptcy plan for Vallejo, California.
Vallejo’s creditors ended up with five cents
on the dollar, public employees with
somethingliketwentyandthirtycentsonthe
dollar. The city no longer received any rating
atallfromMoody’sandStandard&Poor’s.It
would take years to build the track record
needed to obtain a decent rating. The ab-
sence of a rating mattered little, as the last

thing the city needed to do was to go out and
borrow money from strangers.
More out of idle curiosity than with any
clear purpose, I drove up again to Vallejo
and paid a call on the fire department. In the
decay of our sense of common purpose, the
firefighters are a telling sign that we are ap-
proaching a new bottom. It isn’t hard to ima-
gine how a police department might wind up
in conflict with the community it’s hired to
protect. A person who becomes a police of-
ficer enjoys the authority. He wants to stop
the bad guys. He doesn’t necessarily need to
care for the people he polices. A person who
becomes a firefighter wants to be a good guy.
He wants to beloved.
The Vallejo firefighter I met with that
morning was named Paige Meyer. He was
forty-one years old. He had short salt-and-
pepper hair and olive skin, with traces of
burn marks on his cheeks. His natural ex-
pression was a smile. He wasn’t particularly

either religious or political. (“I’m not neces-
sarily a God guy.”) The closest thing he had
to a religion, apart from his family, was his
job. He was extremely proud of it, and of his
colleagues. “I don’t want this to sound arrog-
ant at all,” he said. “But many departments
in nicer communities, they get a serious fire
maybe once a year. We get them all the
time.” The Vallejo population is older and
poorer than in many surrounding cities, and
older still are the buildings it lives in. The
typical Vallejo house is a charming, highly
inflammable wooden Victorian. “In this town
we fight fires,” says Meyer. “This town rips.”
The department was shaped by its environ-
ment: they were extremely aggressive fire-
fighters. “When I came to this department
you rolled to a fire,” he said. “You were not
going to see an exterior water stream from
this department. We’re going in. You have
some knucklehead calling in with a sore
throat—your giddyup is not so fast. But I’ll

tell you something about this department.
They get a call that there’s a baby choking or
a ten-year-old not breathing, you better get
out of the way, or you’re going to get run
over.”
As a young man, to pay his way through
college, Meyer had worked as a state beach
lifeguard at lakes in central California. He
assumed that there would be little drama in
the work but people would turn up, get
drunk, and attempt to drown. A few of the
times he pulled people from the water, they
were in bad enough shape that they needed
paramedics; the fire department was there
on the spot. He started talking to firefighters
and found that “they all absolutely loved
what they did. You get to go and live and cre-
ate a second family. How can you not like
that?” He came to Vallejo in 1998, at the age
of twenty-eight. He had left a cushy job in
Sunnyvale, outside San Jose, where there
aren’t many fires, precisely because he



==================================================
                     PAGE 385

wanted to fight fires. “In other departments,”
he says, “I wasn’t a firefighter. The first six
months of the job here, I was out at two in
the morning at a fire every other week. I
couldn’t believe it.” The houses of Vallejo are
mainly balloon-frame construction. The in-
terior walls have no firebreaks: from bottom
to top, all four walls carry fire as efficiently
as a chimney. One of the rookie mistakes in
Vallejo is to put the fire out on the ground
floor,onlytolookupandseeitroaring outof
the roof. “When we get to a fire we say,
‘Boom! Send someone up to the attic.’ Be-
cause the fire is going right to the attic.”
Meyer actually had made that rookie mis-
take. One day not long after he’d arrived,
he’d jumped off the truck already breathing
air fromatank andracedintowhatappeared
to be a burning one-bedroom apartment. He
knocked down the door and put the attack
line on the fire and then wondered why the
fire wasn’t going out. “It should have been

getting cooler, but it was getting hotter and
hotter.” Right in front of his face, on his
plastic mask, lines trickled down, like rain on
a windshield. The old-school firefighters left
their ears exposed so they could feel the
heat: the heat contained the critical informa-
tion. Meyer could only see the heat: his hel-
met was melting. “If your helmet starts to
shrivel up and melt, that’s not cool,” he says.
A melting helmet, among the other problems
it presents, is an indication that a room is
about to flash. Flashing, he explains, “is
when all combustible materials simultan-
eously ignite. You’re a baked potato after
that.” He needed more water, or to get out;
but his ego was invested in staying inside,
and so he stayed inside. Moments later a
backup arrived, with another, bigger hose.
Afterward, he understood his mistake: the
building was three stories, built on a slope
that disguised its size, and the fire had
reached the attic. “I’m not saying that if the

backup hadn’t come when it did I’d be dead,”
he says, but that’s exactly what he is saying.
The scar on his face is from that fire. “I
needed to learn to control my environment,”
he said. “I’d had this false sense of security.”
When you take care of something you be-
come attached to it, and he’d become at-
tached to Vallejo. He was extremely uncom-
fortable with conflict between his union and
the citizens, and had found himself in
screaming matches with the union’s negoti-
ator. Meyer thought firefighters, who tended
to be idealistic and trusting, were easily
duped. He further thought the rank-and-file
had been deceived both by the city, which
lied to them repeatedly in negotiations, and
bytheirownleadership, whichharnessed the
firefighters’ outrage to make unreasonable
demands in the union-negotiated contract
with the city. What was lost at the bargaining
table was the reason they did what they did
for a living. “I’m telling you,” Meyer says,

“when I started, I didn’t know what I was
getting paid. I didn’t care what I was getting
paid. I didn’t know about benefits. A lot of
things that we’re politicizing today were not
even in my mind. I was just thinking of my
dream job. Let me tell you something else:
nobody cared in 2007 how much I made. If I
made six figures they said, ‘Shit, man, you
deserve it. You ran into a burning building.’
Because everyone had a job. All they knew
about our job is that it was dangerous. The
minute the economy started to collapse,
people started looking at each other.”
Today the backup that may or may not
have saved him is far less likely to arrive.
When Vallejo entered bankruptcy, the fire
department was cut from 121 to 67, for a city
of 112,000 people. The department handles
roughly 13,000 calls a year, extremely high
for the population. When people feel
threatened or worried by anything except
other people, they call the fire department.

Most of these calls are of the cat-in-the-tree
variety—pointless. (“You never see the skel-
eton of a cat in a tree.”) They get calls from
people who have headaches. They get calls
from people who have itches where they
can’t scratch. They have to answer every call.
(“The best call I ever had was phantom leg
pain in a guy with no legs.”) To deal with
these huge numbers of calls, they once had
eight stations, eight three-person engine
companies, a four-man truck company (used
only for actual fires and rescue calls), one
fireboat, one confined space rescue team,
and a team to deal with hazardous materials.
They now are down to four stations, four en-
gines, and a truck.
This is particularly relevant to Paige Meyer
because, two months ago, he became
Vallejo’s new fire chief. It surprised him: he
hadn’t even applied for the job. The city
manager, Phil Batchelor, just called him to

me if I wanted the job,” says Meyer. “He just
asked how’s the family, told me he was giv-
ing me the job, and asked if I had any prob-
lem with that.”
He didn’t, actually. He sat down and made
a list of ways to improve the department. He
faced a fresh challenge: how to deliver ser-
vice that was the same as before, or even bet-
ter than before, with half the resources. How
to cope with an environment of scarcity. He
began to measure things that hadn’t been
measured. The number one cause of death in
firefighting was heart attacks. Number two
was a truck crash. He was now in charge of a
department that would be both overworked
and in a hurry. Fewer people doing twice the
work probably meant twice the number of
injuries per firefighter. He’d decided to tailor
fitness regimens to fit the job. With fewer
fire stations and fewer firefighters in them,
the response times were going to be slower.
He’d need to find new ways to speed things

up. A longer response time meant less room
for error; a longer response time meant the
fires they’d be fighting would be bigger. He
had some thoughts about the most efficient
way to fight these bigger fires. He began, in
short, to rethink firefighting.
When people pile up debts they will find
difficult and perhaps even impossible to re-
pay, they are saying several things at once.
They are obviously saying that they want
more than they can immediately afford. They
are saying, less obviously, that their present
wants are so important that, to satisfy them,
itisworthsomefuturedifficulty.Butinmak-
ing that bargain they are implying that when
the future difficulty arrives, they’ll figure it
out. They don’t always do that. But you can
never rule out the possibility that they will.
As idiotic as optimism can sometimes seem,
it has a weird habit of paying off.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
At the end of every book I write there al-
ways seem to be people who deserve more
than to be thanked at the end of a book. This
one is no different. Act II of the financial
crisis was set in places it would never have
occurred to me to go. I’d like to thank Gray-
don Carter and Doug Stumpf, at Vanity Fair,
for encouraging me to go there, and Jaime
Lalinde, for researching these places so well
that I sometimes felt he, not I, should be
writing about them. Theo Phanos offered me
not only friendship and encouragement but
the shrewd views of an interesting money
manager, from start to finish. At W. W. Nor-
ton, Janet Byrne has appeared from nowhere

to improve my prose and, to the extent it is
possible for an editor to do this, save me
from myself. Starling Lawrence remains my
touchstone.
