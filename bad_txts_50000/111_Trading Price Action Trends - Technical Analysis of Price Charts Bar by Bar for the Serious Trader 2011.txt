Introduction
T
here is a reason why there is no other comprehensive book about price
action written by a trader. It takes thousands of hours, and the financial
reward is meager compared to that from trading. However, with my three
girls now away in grad school, I have a void to fill and this has been a very sat-
isfying project. I originally planned on updating the first edition of Reading Price
Charts Bar by Bar (John Wiley & Sons, 2009), but as I got into it, I decided instead
to go into great detail about how I view and trade the markets. I am metaphorically
teaching you how to play the violin. Everything you need to know to make a liv-
ing at it is in these books, but it is up to you to spend the countless hours learning
your trade. After a year of answering thousands of questions from traders on my
website at www.brookspriceaction.com, I think that I have found ways to express
my ideas much more clearly, and these books should be easier to read than that
one. The earlier book focused on reading price action, and this series of books is
instead centered on how to use price action to trade the markets. Since the book
grewtomorethanfourtimesasmanywordsasthefirstbook,JohnWiley&Sons
decided to divide it into three separate books. This first book covers price action
basics and trends. The second book is on trading ranges, order management, and
themathematicsoftrading,andthefinalbookisabouttrendreversals,daytrading,
daily charts, options, and the best setups for all time frames. Many of the charts
arealsoinReadingPriceChartsBarbyBar,butmosthavebeenupdatedandthe
discussion about the charts has also been largely rewritten. Only about 5 percent
of the 120,000 words from that book are present in the 570,000 words in this new
series,soreaderswillfindlittleduplication.
Mygoalsinwritingthisseriesofthreebooksaretodescribemyunderstanding
of why the carefully selected trades offer great risk/reward ratios, and to present
ways to profit from the setups. I am presenting material that I hope will be inter-
estingtoprofessionaltradersandstudentsinbusinessschool,butIalsohopethat

whateachbaronthechartistellingthemaboutwhatinstitutionalmoneyisdoing.
Ninety percent or more of all trading in large markets is done by institutions,
which means that the market is simply a collection of institutions. Almost all are
profitable over time, and the few that are not soon go out of business. Since in-
stitutions are profitable and they are the market, every trade that you take has a
profitable trader (a part of the collection of institutions) taking the other side of
yourtrade.Notradecantakeplacewithoutoneinstitutionwillingtotakeoneside
andanotherwillingtotaketheother.Thesmall-volumetradesmadebyindividuals
can only take place if an institution is willing to take the same trade. If you want
to buy at a certain price, the market will not get to that price unless one or more

Cisco Systems (CSCO) had a strong earnings report and is moving up, and if you
are an investor who wants to hold stock for many months, then do what the tra-
ditional institutions are doing and buy CSCO. However, if you are a day trader,
ignore the news and look at the chart, because the programs will create patterns

day trades and other short-term trades determine the path to that target and the
ultimate high or low of the move. Even on a macro level, fundamentals are only
approximate at best. Look at the crashes in 1987 and 2009. Both had violent sell-
offs and rallies, yet the fundamentals did not change violently in the same short
period of time. In both cases, the market got sucked slightly below the monthly
trend line and reversed sharply up from it. The market fell because of perceived

The books are very detailed and difficult to read and are directed toward se-
rious traders who want to learn as much as they can about reading price charts.
However,theconceptsareusefultotradersatalllevels.Thebookscovermanyof
the standard techniques described by Robert D. Edwards and John Magee (Tech-
nical Analysis of Stock Trends, AMACOM, 9th ed., 2007) and others, but focus
moreonindividualbarstodemonstratehowtheinformationtheyprovidecansig-
nificantly enhance the risk/reward ratio of trading. Most books point out three or
four trades on a chart, which implies that everything else on the chart is incom-
prehensible, meaningless, or risky. I believe that there is something to be learned
from every tick that takes place during the day and that there are far more great
tradesoneverychartthanjustthefewobviousones;buttoseethem,youhaveto

Theyareallimportant.Attheendofeverybar,mosttradersaskthemselves,“What

atthemomentsoitisjustnotworththeefforttotrytounderstand.Instead,they
choose to wait for some clearer and usually larger pattern. It is as if they believe
that the bar did not exist, or they dismiss it as just institutional program activ-
ity that is not tradable by an individual trader. They do not feel like they are part
ofthemarketatthesetimes,butthesetimesconstitutethevastmajorityoftheday.
Yet,iftheylookatthevolume,allofthosebarsthattheyareignoringhaveasmuch
volume as the bars they are using for the bases for their trades. Clearly, a lot of
tradingistakingplace, but theydon’tunderstand how thatcanbeand essentially
pretend that it does not exist. But that is denying reality. There is always trading

writing this entirely from a trader’s perspective. I am certain that many traders
already understand everything in these books, but likely wouldn’t describe price
action in the same way that I do. There are no secrets among successful traders;
they all know common setups, and many have their own names for each one. All
of them are buying and selling pretty much at the same time, catching the same

that is the appearance that occurs in an efficient market with countless traders

action is a sound approach, it is still very difficult to do successfully in real time.

Many traders consider price action only when trading divergences and trend
pullbacks.Infact,mosttradersusingindicatorswon’ttakeatradeunlessthereis
astrongsignalbar,andmanywouldenteronastrongsignalbarifthecontextwas
right, even if there was no divergence. They like to see a strong close on a large
reversal bar, but in reality this is a fairly rare occurrence. The most useful tools
forunderstandingpriceactionaretrendlinesandtrendchannellines,priorhighs
andlows,breakoutsandfailedbreakouts,thesizesofbodiesandtailsoncandles,
and relationships between the current bar to the prior several bars. In particular,
how the open, high, low, and close of the current bar compare to the action of
the prior several bars tells a lot about what will happen next. Charts provide far
moreinformationaboutwhoisincontrolofthemarketthanmosttradersrealize.
Almost every bar offers important clues as to where the market is going, and a
trader who dismisses any activity as noise is passing up many profitable trades
each day. Most of the observations in these books are directly related to placing
trades, but a few have to do with simple curious price action tendencies without
sufficientdependabilitytobethebasisforatrade.

Any trend that covers a lot of points in very few bars, meaning that there is
some combination of large bars and bars that overlap each other only minimally,
will eventually have a pullback. These trends have such strong momentum that
the odds favor resumption of the trend after the pullback and then a test of the
trend’sextreme.Usuallytheextremewillbeexceeded,aslongasthepullbackdoes

about to take a hit. They found a snowball effect and an increased desire to con-
tinue,regardlessoftheoutcomeoftheirbehavior.Unfortunately,whenfacedwith
losses,tradersassumemoreriskratherthanless,oftenleadingtothedeathoftheir
accounts. Without knowing the neuroscience, Warren Buffett clearly understood
theproblem,asseeninhisstatement,“Onceyouhaveordinaryintelligence,what
you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trou-
ble in investing.” The great traders control their emotions and constantly follow
theirrules.
One final point about gambling: There is a natural tendency to assume that
nothing can last forever and that every behavior regresses toward a mean. If the
market has three or four losing trades, surely the odds favor the next one be-
ing a winner. It’s just like flipping a coin, isn’t it? Unfortunately, that is not how
markets behave. When a market is trending, most attempts to reverse fail. When
it is in a trading range, most attempts to break out fail. This is the opposite of
coin flips, where the odds are always 50–50. In trading, the odds are more like
70 percent or better that what just happened will continue to happen again and
again.Becauseofthecoinfliplogic,mosttradersatsomepointbegintoconsider
gametheory.
Martingale techniques work well in theory but not in practice because of the
conflictbetweenmathandemotion.Thatisthemartingaleparadox.Ifyoudouble
(or even triple) your position size and reverse at each loss, you will theoretically
make money. Although four losers in a row is uncommon on the 5 minute Emini

Since trading is fun and competitive, it is natural for people to compare it to
games, and because wagering is involved, gambling is usually the first thing that
comes to mind. However, a far more apt analogy is to chess. In chess, you can
see exactly what your opponent is doing, unlike in card games where you don’t
knowyouropponent’scards.Also,inpoker,thecardsthatyouaredealtareyours
purely by chance, but in chess, the location of your pieces is entirely due to your

in a short time frame, like in 1927 and 1987, it is more useful to think of it as just
another chart pattern because that removes the emotion and helps traders follow
their rules. If you remove the time and price axes from a chart and focus simply

the primary discussion under “Deeper Discussion of This Chart.” Even though you
might find this incomprehensible when you first read it, you will understand it on a
second reading of the books. The more variations of standard patterns that you see,
the better you will be able to spot them as they are developing in real time. I also
usually point out the major one or two trades on the chart. If you prefer, you can
ignore that supplemental discussion on your first read and then look at the charts
again after completing the books when the deeper discussion would be understand-
able. Since many of the setups are excellent examples of important concepts, even
though not yet covered, many readers will appreciate having the discussion if they
go through the books again.
At the time of publication, I am posting a daily end-of-day analysis of
the Emini and providing real-time chart reading during the trading day at
www.brookspriceaction.com.
All of the charts in the three books will be in a larger format on John Wiley &
Sons’ site at www.wiley.com/go/tradingtrends. (See the “About the Website” page

Reversal attempts in the form of spikes against the trend have no follow-
through,fail,andbecomeflagsinthedirectionofthetrend.

(cid:2)
The breakout bar has a large bull trend body and small tails or no tails. The
largerthebar,themorelikelythebreakoutwillsucceed.

If the volume of the large breakout bar is 10 to 20 times the average volume
of recent bars, the chance of follow-through buying and a possible measured
moveincreases.

(cid:2)
The next two or three bars also have bull bodies that are at least the av-
erage size of the recent bull and bear bodies. Even if the bodies are rela-
tively small and the tails are prominent, if the follow-through bar (the bar
after the initial breakout bar) is large, the odds of the trend continuing are
greater.

The spike grows to five to 10 bars without pulling back for more than a bar
orso.

Becauseoftheinherenthighlevelofuncertainty,Ioftenusewordslikeusually,
likely, and probably to describe what I think will follow in at least 60 percent of
cases. This can be frustrating to readers, but if you are going to make a living as
a trader, this is as good as it gets. Nothing is ever close to certain, and you are
always operating in a gray fog. The best trades that you will ever see will always
be described by uncertain words like these because they are the most accurate
descriptionsoftherealitythattradersface.
Everything is relative and everything can change to the exact opposite in an
instant, even without any movement in price. It might be that you suddenly see a
trend line seven ticks above the high of the current bar and instead of looking to

Many television analysts make trade recommendations based on their funda-
mentalanalysis,andthendescribethetradeintechnicalterms.Thisisparticularly
true of forex traders. They will isolate an event, like an upcoming central bank
meeting for some country, predict what the outcome will be, and recommend a
trade based on that expected outcome. When they describe their trade, they will
invariably make it clear that the trade is entirely technical and has nothing to do
with the fundamentals. For example, if the EUR/USD is in a bull trend, they will
invariably conclude that the meeting will make the Euro stronger against the dol-
lar and recommend buying a pullback, placing a protective stop below the most
recent swing low, and going for a profit target that is about twice as large as the
stop.Nooneneedstoknowanythingaboutthatmeetingtoplacethattrade.They

announcement might have, and that is already reflected in the price. Also, these

The price action that traders see during the day is the result of institutional

the direction of the move, generating momentum on the charts and causing addi-
tional traders to enter. Traders, including institutions, place their bids and offers

likely located at one tick below a bar and will result in losses to traders who just

you will have a good chance to make a profit off the trapped traders as they are
forcedout.

There is often a pullback that tests the entry bar’s extreme to the tick. For

In the 5 minute Emini, there are certain price action events that change the
perspective of smart traders. For example, if there is a two-legged pullback (an

stealthy,andfilledwithsmartpeople.
CBS’s 60 Minutes ran a story on HFT in October 2010 and reported that as
much as 70 percent of the volume and over a billion shares of stock daily were
being traded by HFT programs. This is somewhat misleading because the HFT
firms are only part of the algorithm trading world. There are other programs that
are designed for longer-term trading and are also part of that 70 percent. Both
the instantaneous high-frequency trading software and the longer-term program
tradingsoftwarearecreatedbyquantitativeanalysts.Thesequantsaremathemati-

Deeper Discussion of This Chart
The day broke out above yesterday’s high on the open and the breakout failed, lead-
ing to a “trend from the open” bear trend day. This was also a trend resumption bear
trendday.Wheneverthereisastrongtrendontheopenandthenatighttradingrange
for several hours, the chances for a trend resumption day are good. There is often a
false breakout between approximately 11:00 a.m. and noon PST, trapping traders into
the wrong direction, and that failed breakout is a great setup for a swing trade into
theclose.

For a trader, it is most useful to think of all bars as being either trend bars
or nontrend (trading range) bars. Since the latter is an awkward term and most
are similar to doji bars, it is simpler to refer to all nontrend bars as dojis. If the
body appears tiny or nonexistent on the chart, the bar is a doji; neither the bulls
northebearscontrolledthebar,andthebarisessentiallyaone-bartradingrange.
On a 5 minute Emini chart, a doji body is nonexistent or only a tick or two large,

All trend bars are attempts to break out into a trend, but as discussed in the
next chapter, most breakouts fail. Also, all trends begin with a trend bar, which
might have a body that might be only a little larger than the bodies of the recent
bars. Sometimes it is large and followed by several other trend bars in the same
direction, which indicates a stronger trend and one more likely to have follow-
through.

Figure3.1BREAKOUTS,TRADINGRANGES,TESTS,ANDREVERSALS 81
Every sharp move and every strong reversal should be thought of as a breakout
of something. It does not matter if you view this sharp move up from bar 2 as a
breakout above the small bear trend line drawn from bar 1 or as a breakout above
the bar 2 reversal bar. What does matter is that during this spike, the market agreed
that the price was too low and it was trending quickly to find an area where both
the bulls and the bears were comfortable placing trades. This resulted in a channel
up from bars 5 to 6, and within the channel, there were many bars that overlapped
with the bar before or after. This overlap of bars represents a hesitation by the bulls
where the market was now able to trade down for a few ticks and a few minutes
before moving higher. Some bulls were taking profits as the market was working
higher, and bears were beginning to short. Many were adding to their shorts (scal-
ing in) as the market went up, just as many bulls were taking more and more off
(scaling out). This channel is a weaker bull move, and channels are usually the start
of a trading range. As you can see, the market retraced back to around the start of
the channel by bar 7.
Bar 7 was a higher low test of the bar 5 swing low and a second test of yester-
day’s low, and the market reversed up in a double bottom.
Bar 8 was a lower high test of the bar 6 high and of yesterday’s close, and
formed a double top instead of a breakout. It also tested the high of the bear inside
bar that followed bar 6, and that bar was the signal bar for the sell-off that followed.
The reversal down to bar 9 tested the moving average and became simply a
pullback from the breakout attempt; it was followed by a successful breakout to a
new high of the day. Bar 9 also tested the long entry above the bull bar that followed
bar7,anditmissedthebreakevenstopbyatick.Whenthebullsareabletoprevent

This type of pattern is a spike and channel bull trend. It is useful here because
it shows a market transitioning from one-sided trading (a strong trend) to two-sided
trading (a trading range). It does not matter if you view bar 3 alone as the spike or
the entire sharp move from bars 2 to 4 as the spike. The market pulled back to bar 5

In general, traders should require signal bars to be stronger for trend rever-
sal entries than for trend pullback and trading range trades. This is because most
countertrend trades fail and you need to do everything possible to improve your
chances of success. The very strongest trends usually have terrible-looking signal
bars, but the trades are still excellent. If a setup is too obvious, the market will

Signal Bars:
Reversal Bars
A
reversal bar is one of the most reliable signal bars, and it is simply a bar
that reverses some aspect of the direction of the prior bar or bars. If you
look at smaller time frame charts, you will see that every bull reversal bar
ismadeupofabeartrendbarandthenabulltrendbar,buttheydon’thavetobe
consecutive.Themarkethadasellclimaxfollowedbyabullbreakout(remember,
alltrendbarsaresimultaneouslyspikes,breakouts,andclimaxes,butthecontext
determines which property is dominant at the moment). The opposite is true of a
bearreversalbar,wherethereisasmallertimeframebulltrendbar,indicatingthat
a buy climax took place, followed by a bear trend bar, indicating that the market
brokeouttothedownside.
Most traders want a reversal bar to have a body in the opposite direction of
theoldtrend,butthatisnotnecessaryandtherearemanyothercomponentsofa
reversalthatshouldtobeconsidered.
The best-known signal bar is the reversal bar and the minimum that a bull
reversal bar should have is either a close above its open (a bull body) or a
close above its midpoint. The best bull reversal bars have more than one of the
following:
(cid:2)
An open near or below the close of the prior bar and a close above the open

This final property is true of any strong trend bar, such as a strong breakout
bar,signalbar,orentrybar.Forexample,atthebottomofabearleg,ifthereisa

is above the high of the past five bars, this is usually stronger, depending on the
context, than a reversal bar that has a close above only the close of the prior bar
andisnotabovethehighofanyoftherecentbars.
The market can trend up or down after any bar, and therefore every bar is a
setupbarforbothalongentryandashortentry.Asetupbarbecomesasignalbar
only if a trade is entered on the next bar, which becomes the entry bar. A setup
bar in and of itself is not a reason to enter a trade. It has to be viewed in relation
to the bars before it and it can lead to a trade only if it is part of a continuation
orreversalpattern.Oneofthemostdifficultthingsfornewtradersisthatasignal
baroftenseemstosuddenlyappearoutofnowhereinthefinalsecondsbeforethe
barclosesandattimesandlocationsthatjustdon’tmakesenseuntilseveralbars

up or down on the next bar. Just like the best chess players think several moves
inadvance,thebesttradersareconstantlythinkingaboutreasonswhythemarket
might go up or down on the next bar and next several bars. This puts them in a
position to anticipate signal bars so that they are ready to place orders if a good
setupquicklydevelops.
Since it is always wisest to be trading with the trend, a trade is most likely
to succeed if the signal bar is a strong trend bar in the direction of the trade. Re-

this,whatappearstobeaperfectreversalbarona5minutecandlechartmightnot

emember, a signal bar is a setup bar that led to an entry. However, not all
trades are worth taking, and just because a stop was triggered and turned
the prior bar into a signal bar, that does not make the trade worth taking
(for example, many signals in a tight trading range, which is described later,
are best avoided). All signal bars are meaningless in the absence of price action
that indicates that the breakout of the bar will likely go far enough for at least a

because the phrase reminds traders that the market made a strong move in one
direction and then a strong move in the opposite direction. The strongest moves
usually begin with either a reversal bar or a two-bar reversal for the signal. This
is why it is so important to be ready to place a trade when the setup occurs at a
time when a strong move might follow. Two-bar reversals have many variations
andareapartofeveryreversal,buttheymaynotbeapparentonthechartyouare

necessary to look at many types of charts to find a perfect two-bar reversal or a

The key is to recognize that a reversal is taking place, and you need to be aware
of the many ways that it can appear. A bear reversal always has a bull trend bar,

acting as a breakout to the downside. A bull reversal is the opposite, with a bear
trendbarthatisactingasasellclimaxandthenabulltrendbarthatisactingasa

A reversal bar can be the second bar of a two-bar reversal. When it overlaps
more than about 75 percent of the prior bar, it is better to regard the two bars as
a two-bar reversal setup rather than as a reversal bar. If you do so, the odds of
a successful reversal trade are higher. For example, if the market is rallying and

When a trend bar in a strong trend has a shaved body (no tail at one or both
ends), it usually indicates that the market is one-sided and strong. However, a
shaved top on a 5 minute bull trend bar in a runaway bull trend is stronger than
a shaved bottom, because the extreme strength is right into the close of the bar
and it is more likely to continue the strength that occurred five minutes earlier.
Therefore, a shaved top isa good setup for a long. If the bar has a one-tick tail at
itshighorashavedbottom,itisstillstrong,butingeneralthatalonewouldnotbe

of the new bears and increases the chance of success. Also, since they just lost, they
will be hesitant to buy, and the losses of buyers increase the chance of a successful

FIGURE 6.13 NoTailsMeansStrength
A bar with no tail at either end in a strong trend is a sign of strength, and traders
should enter with trend on its breakout. In Figure 6.13, bar 8 was a bear bar in a
strong bear trend, and it had no tail at both its high and its low, indicating severe
selling pressure (they sold it from start to finish). It was likely that there would
be more selling to come. Traders have to be fast in placing their sell stop orders

side bars are complicated to read because both the bulls and the bears were
in control at some point within the bar or the prior bar, and there are many sub-
tleties in their analysis. The increased size of the bar means that bulls and bears
are willing to be more aggressive, but if the close is near the middle, it is essen-
tiallyaone-bar-longtradingrange.Infact,bydefinition,sinceanoutsidebartotally

or more bars that largely overlap. At other times, they can act as reversal bars or
trendbars.Tradersmustpayattentiontothecontextinwhichtheyoccur.
Traditional technical analysis teaches that outside bars are setup bars for a
breakout in either direction, and that you should put an entry stop above and be-
low. Once filled, double the size of the unfilled stop and make it a reversal order.
However, itisalmost always unwise toenter on abreakout of a5minute outside
bar, especially if the outside bar is large, because of the greater risk that the dis-
tantstopentails.Sometimestheyoccurwhenyouarelookingforamajorreversal
and you are very confident that there will be a large, strong reversal. When that

The market broke out to the downside with a large gap down and a bear trend bar in
Figure7.3,butinsteadoftradingdownandcreatingatrendfromtheopenbeartrend,
the breakout to the downside failed and the market reversed up into a trend from the
openbullday.
Bar 2 was an outside bar up and a possible low of the day since the market was
reversing up from a big gap down. This means that it was on bar 2 that the market
decided that the trend was up and therefore it should be considered the start of the
move up. Although bar 3 was a low 2 short, it was seen by the market as just a low 1

This is a perfect example of a common problem that traders face when they
try to reduce risk by watching a smaller time frame chart. The risk is smaller but
the probability of success also drops. Since there are more trades on a 3 minute

Second Entries
A
nalysts often say that bottoms on the daily chart usually require a second
reversal off the low to convince enough traders to trade the market as a
possiblenewbulltrend.However,thisistrueoftopsaswell.Asecondentry
isalmostalwaysmorelikelytoresultinaprofitabletradethanafirstentry.
If the second entry is letting you in at a better price than the first, be suspi-
cious that it might be a trap. Most good second entries are at the same price or
worse. A second-entry trader is someone entering late, trying to minimize risk,
and the market usually makes him pay a little more for that additional informa-
tion. If it is charging you less, it might be setting you up to steal your money in a
failedsignal.
Traders looking for second entries are more aggressive and confident and
will often enter on smaller time frame charts. This usually results in traders on
the 5 minute charts entering after many other traders have already entered, mak-
ing the entry a little worse. If the market is letting you in at a better price, you
should suspect that you are missing something and should consider not taking
the trade. Most of the time, a good fill equals a bad trade (and a bad fill equals a
goodtrade!).
Ifyouarefadingamove,forexampleshortingthefirstreversalinastrongbull
trend where the move had about four consecutive bull trend bars or two or three
largebulltrendbars,thereistoomuchmomentumforyoutobeplacinganorder
in the opposite direction. It is better to wait for an entry, not take it, wait for the
trend to resume for a bar or two, and then enter on the market’s second attempt
toreverse.

line is drawn across the highs of a bear trend. A trend line is most helpful
whenlookingforentriesinthedirectionofthetrendonpullbacksandinthe
opposite direction after the trend line is broken. Trend lines can be drawn using
swingpointsorbestfittechniquessuchaslinearregressioncalculationsorsimply
quickly drawing a best approximation. They also can be created as a parallel of
a trend channel line and then dragged to the trend line side of the bars, but this
approach is rarely needed since there is usually an acceptable trend line that can
be drawn using the swing points. Sometimes the best fit trend line is drawn just
using the candle bodies and ignoring the tails; this is common in wedge patterns,
whichoftendonothaveawedgeshape.Itisnotnecessarytoactuallydrawtheline
when it is obvious. If you do draw a line, you usually can erase it moments after
youverifythatthemarkethastestedit,becausetoomanylinesonthechartcanbe

the line from ever being reached? Common wisdom is that novice traders on the
wrong side hold their losing positions until they cannot stand any more pain, and
then suddenly all of them exit at once, creating a blow-off or a parabolic climax.
For example, in a bull channel, the market works its way up to some resistance
level, even if it is not very apparent or impressive, and pokes through it, causing
the last shorts to no longer be willing to take the pain. They suddenly give up. As

bar 7 was a buy simply based on the break of the trend line drawn over the first
hour of trading, and the second attempt to reverse the breakout below the bar 5
low of the open. It is usually far better to place orders based on the most re-
cent price action if it provides a justification for a trade than to look back 30 or

In Figure 14.3, the trend line from bars 2 and 3 was used to create a parallel that
was dragged to bar 1 and extended to the right. This trend channel line was not

The simple trend channel line created from the bars 1 and 5 lows was pene-

form as the market tests the top of the channel. This often attracts overly eager

Since achannel isasloping tradingrange, justlikewithother tradingranges,
most attempts to break out of either the top or the bottom fail. Yes, one side is
stronger, but the principleisthe same as forany trading range. For example, ina
bullchannel,bothbullsandbearsareactivebutthebullsarestrongerandthatis
whythechannelisslopingup.Boththebullsandthebearsarecomfortableplacing
trades in the middle of the channel, but when the market gets near the top of the
channel,thebullsbecomeconcernedthattheupsidebreakoutwillfail;andassoon
astheythinkthatafailureislikely,theywillselloutofsomeoftheirlongs.Also,the
bears were comfortable shorting in the middle of the channel and will short even
more aggressively near the top, at a better value. When the market gets near the
bottomoftherange,thebearsarelessinterestedinshortingattheselowerprices
and the bulls, who were just buying moments ago at higher prices, will buy even
moreaggressivelyhere.Thisleadstoabounceupoffofthetrendline.Themarket

Ultimately,thedownsidebreakoutwillbestrongenoughtobefollowedbyalower
highandthenalowerlow,andwhenthathappens,traderswillbegintodrawabear
channel,evenifthebullchannelstillexists,albeitmuchwider.
It is important to realize that most bull breakouts of bull channels fail. If the
bulls are able to create a bull breakout and they can overwhelm the bears, they
usually will be able to do so for only a few bars. At that point, the bulls will see
themarketastoooverdoneandwilltakeprofits;theywon’twanttobuyuntilthe
markethascorrectedforawhile.Themagneticeffectofthemiddleofthechannel
will usually pull the market back into the channel and cause the breakout to fail,
making the breakout a buy climax. Once back in the channel, the market usually
pokesthroughthebottomofthechannelasitsminimumobjective.Thebuyclimax
usuallyleadstoatwo-leggedcorrectionthatlastsabout10barsandusuallybreaks
below the channel. Once the downside breakout happens, if the selling continues
the next objective is a measured move equal to about the height of the channel.
Thebearsalsoknowthatthebuyclimaxwilllikelybefollowedbyacorrectionand

Sometimes an upside breakout of a bull channel is strong and does not fail
withinafewbars.Whenthisisthecase,themarketwillusuallyrallytoameasured
move target, and the breakout will become a measuring gap. For example, if the
bull channel has a wedge shape, and breaks to the downside, but the downside

All channels eventually end in a breakout, which can be violent or have very
littlemomentum.Trendchannelsusuallylastmuchlongerthanwhatmosttraders
suspect and they often trap traders into prematurely taking reversal trades. Most
channels usually have at least three legs before they end. This is especially clear
in triangles, and in wedges in particular. With triangles, the breakout is usually
imminentbutthedirectionisoftennotclear.

the next rally carefully. They want to see whether that rally will simply be a test
of the bull high or will instead break out strongly above the high and be followed
by another strong leg up in the bull trend. One of the most important considera-
tions is the momentum of that test of the bull high. If the rally is in a very tight,
steep channel withnopullbacks andverylittleoverlapbetween thebars,andthe

As with all breakouts, three things can then happen: it can be successful and
be followed by more trading in that direction; it can fail and become a small cli-
macticreversal;orthemarketcanjustgosidewaysandthepatterncanevolveinto
a trading range. Most breakouts have an attempt to reverse within a few bars. If
thereversalbarisstrongcomparedtothebreakoutbar,theoddsofafailedbreak-
out and a successful reversal are good. If the reversal bar is weak compared to
the breakout, the odds are that the reversal attempt will fail and set up a break-
out pullback within a bar or two, and the breakout will resume. If the breakout
and the reversal are about equally strong, traders will then look at the bar after
thereversalsignalbar.Forexample,ifthereisastrongbulltrendbarthatbreaks
out of a bull flag, and the next bar is an equally impressive bear reversal bar, the
bar that follows becomes important. If it trades below the bear reversal bar, the
breakout has failed, at least for the moment. If it then has a strong bear close
and is a strong bear trend bar, the chance that the reversal will continue down
increases. If instead it is a strong bull reversal bar, chances are that the failed
breakout will not succeed, and this bull reversal bar then becomes a signal bar
for a breakout pullback buy at one tick above its high. Breakouts are discussed
inbook2.

Channels are common on all charts, and some smaller channels are nested in-
side of larger channels. In Figure 15.1, notice that the lines do not always have
to be drawn to contain all of the highs and lows in the channel. Drawing them
with best fit lines helps to make the channel behavior clearer and often makes it
easiertoanticipatesignals.Sincemosttradingisinstitutionalandplacedbycom-
puterprograms,itisreasonabletoassumethateachsmall,tightchannelisdueto

neldownfrombar4,therewereenoughsellprogramsgoingontooverpowerany

largely inbalance, themarket moves sideways inatighttradingrange, which isa

Bullchannels areindistinguishable frombearflags,andbearchannels should
be thought of as bull flags. When the channel is tight like from bars 2 to 3, buy-
ers should wait until there is a failed breakout and reversal up before looking for
longs,asoccurredatbar3.Theycouldalsowaitforapullbackafterthebreakout,

Deeper Discussion of This Chart
The bar before bar 6 in Figure 15.4 was a breakout pullback short setup and a low 2
short at the moving average. The bar after bar 5 had a large tail, as did several of the
next bars, and that trading range below the moving average was a barbwire pattern,
whichoftenbecomesafinalflag,asitdidhere.

tightchannel.Infact,therewerethreeorfourtightchannelsintherally(sometraders
sawthesecondspikefrombar1tobar3asasinglesteepchannelorspike,andothers

by a channel. The pullback to bar 1 was followed by a two-bar spike and then another

The selling pressure was building, and bulls were likely to take profits on the test of

spike, a spike can also function as a climax. This was the third or fourth consecutive
buyclimax(everyspike,whetheritisonebarormanybars,isaclimax),anditfollowed
a strong bear spike. Consecutive climaxes usually lead to a larger correction, as they
didhere.

FIGURE 15.8 EnteringonLimitOrdersinChannels
In addition to entering on stops, entering on limit (or market) orders can be an
effective approach whenever the market is in any type of channel, including tri-
angles and trading ranges. In Figure 15.8, the market had eight consecutive bull
trend bars in the strong bull spike up to bar 3, so the market was likely to have
a test of the high after a pullback. Although bears shorted below the bar 3 bear
reversal bar, bulls were scaling in on limit orders below the low of the bar. Some

Bar 6 was a two-legged sideways correction down from the bar 3 high, and
many traders bought above bar 6 on a stop for the test of the bar 3 high. At the

in the early stages of a very strong buy program where momentum buy programs
are also buying aggressively. These traders will try to copy what the computers

magnetic pull that tends to prevent breakouts from going very far. It is also often
tightenoughtosometimesactasaspike,anditcanbefollowedbyabroaderchan-

thatbearmicrotrendline,thistheoreticallysetsupashortonthefailedbreakout.
Since this is occurring during a bull trend and it almost always happens above or
near the moving average, you should not be shorting this pattern. You would find
yourself holding a short at the bottom of a bull flag near a rising moving average
in a bull trend, which is a very low-probability trade. As this short will likely fail,
youshouldanticipatethisandbereadytobuythefailure,gettinginexactlywhere

Small trend lines in strong trends, even when drawn using adjacent bars, of-
ten have failed breakouts that set up good with-trend entries. Many of these are

The day opened with a large gap down in Figure 16.5, but the first bar was a strong
bull reversal bar and therefore set up a trend from the open buy signal based on the
failed breakout below the close of yesterday. The third bar was a strong bear bar and
therefore a spike down, but the market might just be forming a higher low before the
rallyresumes.Instead,themarkettradedabovethehigherlowandthenreverseddown

thereforesetupsfortradesinthedirectionofthelargertrend.Inabulltrend,the
swings should be trending upward, meaning that each pullback should be above
the prior pullback and result in a new high (trending highs and lows, or trending
swings). All moves with strong momentum usually have at least a test of the ex-
tremefollowingapullback(allstrongmovesusuallyhaveatleasttwolegs,evenif
thesecondonefallsshortandreverses).
All trends, no matter how small, must first break a trend line from the prior
trendorasupportorresistancelinefromapriortradingrange,andthenhavetrend-
ingswings(e.g.,aseriesofhigherhighsandlowsinabulltrend).Absenteitherof
these, there is no trend. The best risk/reward ratio occurs when you enter on the
firstpullbackafteratrendlinebreak,beforethereisaclearlyestablishedtrend.As
apossibletrenddayisunfolding,tradersshouldlookforsignsofstrength,eachof
whichincreasestheoddsthatthetrendwillcontinue.
Why is it important to recognize the existence of a trend? Because then most
ofyourtradesshouldbeinthatdirectionandyoumusttrytotakeeverywith-trend
entry and rarely take countertrend entries. Depending on how you define a trend
and a reversal attempt, about 80 percent of attempts to reverse a trend will fail.
Marketshaveinertiaandtendtocontinuewhattheyhavejustbeendoing.Because
ofthisinertia,itmakesfarmoremathematicalsensetowaitforthereversalattempt

range,itwillresistbreakingintoatrendandabout80percentofbreakoutattempts
willfail.
The earlier you see the trend, the more money you stand to make. Focusing
on the countertrend setups will likely make you miss the much more profitable
but often scarier with-trend entries. The with-trend entries are scary because the
market always looks overdone and it’s hard to imagine that selling near the low
of an overdone bear or buying near the high of an overdone bull could ever be
profitable.However,thatisexactlywhyitis!Forexample,inabeartrend,noone
is sure if there is going to be a bounce where they can sell at a better price but
everyone is sure that the market will be even lower very soon. Because of this,
everyone is selling at the market or on tiny pullbacks, and larger pullbacks just
don’tmaterialize.Thelongsneedtogetoutatanypriceandthebearswanttoget

rangephase,uncertaintyincreasesandtheoddshoveraround50–50again.Oneof
the difficulties in trading a trend is that the spike phases are often brief, and by
thetimeyourealizethatoneexists,theremaynotbeenoughticksleftwiththose
increased odds to make a profit. Before you know it, a trading range forms and
the odds are back to 50–50. One of the best ways to trade a trend is to anticipate
whenthenextspikewillbeginandtoenteronastopasitisstarting.Thatway,you
can catch a spike with maybe a 60 percent probability or even higher of making
X ticks before losing X ticks, and if you become proficient at this, you will be a
successfultrader.

switch from extremely bullish to extremely bearish. There is a gradual transition.
Atraderbecomeslessbullish,thenneutral,andthenbearish.Onceenoughtraders

Profittakingmeansthattradersarestillbullishandarelookingtobuyapull-

top, but most reversal attempts fail and become the beginnings of bull flags, only
to be followed by another new high. If a rally to test the high has several small
pullbackswithinthelegup,withlotsofoverlappingbars,severalbearbodies,and
big tails on the tops of the bars, and most of the bull trend bars are weak, then
the market is becoming increasingly two-sided. The bulls are taking profits at the

Since a bull trend has trending highs and lows, then every time the market
reaches a new high, traders should raise their protective stop to one tick below
the most recent low. This is called trailing their stop. Also, if their profit is large

enough, they should consider taking partial profits as the market goes above the
most recent high. Lots of traders do this and that is why trends often pull back
after reaching a new high. The pullback very often goes below the original en-
try price, and inexperienced swing traders will have tightened their stops to the
breakeven price and will get stopped out of a great trend trade. Once the market

Sometraderswillallowpullbacksbelowthesignalbaraslongastheybelieve
that their premise of a bull trend is still valid. For example, assume that the av-
erage range in the Emini has been about 10 to 15 points lately, and they bought
a high 2 pullback in a bull trend on the 5 minute chart. If the signal bar was two
points tall, they might be willing to hold on to their position even if the market
falls below the low of the signal bar, thinking that the pullback might evolve into
a high 3, which is a wedge bull flag buy setup. Other traders would exit if the
market falls below the signal bar and then buy again if a strong high 3 buy sig-
nal sets up. Some might even buy a position that is twice as large as their first,
becausetheyseethestrongsecondsignalasmorereliable.Manyofthesetraders

that the signal did not look quite right. They were allowing for the possibility of
the high 2 failing and then evolving into a wedge bull flag, which might even look
stronger.Ifitturnedouttobe,theywouldthenfeelcomfortabletradingtheirusual
fullsize.
Other traders trade half size when they see questionable signals, exit if their
protective stop is hit, and then take the second signal with a full size if the signal
is strong. Traders who scale in as a trade goes against them obviously do not use
the signal bar extreme for their initial protective stop, and many look to scale in

case the market reversed down. However, since traders subjected themselves to
risk, they must resist the temptation to exit with too small a reward. As long as
the trend is good, it is always best to try to resist taking profits until the market

EveryoneisfamiliarwithanABCpullbackinatrendthatunfoldsinthreesteps.
There is a countertrend move, a small with-trend move that usually does not go
beyond the trend’s extreme, and then a second countertrend move that usually
extends deeper than the first. Trends themselves also tend to subdivide into two
smaller legs as well. Elliott Wave followers look at a trend move and see three
with-trend waves. However, it is better to look at the first strong with-trend leg
asthestartofthemomentum (theElliottWave3),eveniftherewasapriorwith-
trend move or wave (Elliott Wave 1). That strong with-trend move often subdi-
videsintotwosmallerwith-trendmoves,and,afterapullback,thetrendwilloften
make two more pushes to test the extreme of the trend (these two pushes create
Elliott Wave 5). This two-legged view of markets makes more sense to a trader
sinceitofferssoundlogicandabundanttradingopportunities,unlikeElliottWave
Theory, which isessentially useless tothevast majorityoftraderswhoaretrying
tomakemoney.
A break of a trend line is the start of a new leg in the opposite direction. Any
time there is a new trend or any capitulation of one side, there will usually be at
least a two-legged move. This can occur in a pullback in a trend, a breakout, a
majorreversal,oranytimethatenoughtradersbelievethatthemovehassufficient

Sometimes one or both of the legs of a two-push move are composed of two
smaller legs so that the overall move actually has three legs. This is the case in
many three-push patterns where often two of the pushes really are just part of a
single leg. However, if you look carefully at the leg that has the two small legs

continues in a less steep channel for the rest of the day. However, the channel
sometimes accelerates and follows a parabolic curve instead of a linear path. At
other times, it loses momentum and forms a flatter curve. Regardless, the start
of the channel is usually tested later in the day or in the next day or two, and the
test can then be followed by a trading range or a trend in either direction. The
important thing to realize is that if the channel is fairly tight, it is tradable only
in the with-trend direction because the pullbacks will not go far enough for a
countertrendtradetobeprofitable.Muchlessoften,thechannelhasbroadswings

Once you recognize that a spike and channel trend is in effect, do not take
countertrend trades in the hope that an ABC pullback will extend far enough for
a scalper’s profit. This is because invariably there will not have been any prior
trend line break, and the tightness of the channel makes countertrend trading
a losing strategy. The failures of these countertrend scalps are great with-trend
setups. Just enter on a stop where the countertrend traders are exiting with their
protectivestops.
Aggressive traders will enter channels using limit orders, trading with trend
untiltwo-sidedtradingbecomesprominent,andwhichpointtheywillstarttrading
countertrend. For example, if there is a bear spike and then a channel, bears will
enter with limit orders at or above the highs of the prior bars. As the channel ap-

traders should trade only with trend until there is a clear sign of a reversal. Also,
it is risky to scale into a countertrend position in a channel in the second half of
the day, because you will often run out of time. You will find yourself holding an
ever-largerlosingpositionandyouwillbeforcedtobuyitbackwithalargelossby

Why does the market tend to have a larger correction after consecutive sell

they have to get out of their longs at any price. Also, weak bears see the strong

Another type of a strong channel occurs in a spike and climax trend. Here,
after the pause from the spike, the market creates another spike. All spikes are
climaxes and when the market forms consecutive climaxes, it usually will form a
largercorrection,oftentothebeginningofthesecondspike.Butthisisexactlyhow

considered the spike that led to the channel down. The higher high might have
been simply a higher high pullback from the bear spike and can be viewed as the

immediatelywouldseeatradingrangethatbeganaroundbars7,9,or11.Asthebull
channel from bar 7 to bar 15 was forming, they were probably not aware that a bull
channel in a spike and channel day is usually the start of a trading range. However,
experienced traders knew this, and they began to short above every prior swing high,
and many scaled in higher. They exited their shorts around the bar 22 double bottom
test of the bar 9 or bar 11 bottom of the bull channel. Bar 22 also appeared to be a
possible final flag reversal, as well as a second entry long setup at the bottom of the

that the market would come back into the gap to test its strength. The trading
rangefrombar23tobar33wasmostlywithinthatbreakoutgapbetweenbar9and
bar12,whichoftenhappens.
Theinitialrangefrombar4tobar9wasabouthalfthesizeofanaverageday.
So traders expected the range to approximately double. When there is a trading
rangethatisabouthalfofthesizeofanaveragedailyrange,themostcommonway
that the range increases is by a breakout and the formation of a trending trading
rangeday.
The third day’s opening range from bar 19 to bar 21 was about a third of the
sizeofanaverageday,andtradersexpectedabreakout.Sincetheyalsoexpected

wasstronganditwaspossiblethatthedaycouldhavebecomeaspikeandchannel
beartrendday,butbar23testedthesupportprovidedbyyesterday’stradingrange
(the highs of bars 3, 5, and 7). It was about a measured move down, and it also
tested a three-day trend line (not shown). This means that the sell-off might have
simply been a sell vacuum created by strong bulls and bears stepping aside until
themarketfelldowntothesupportzone,atwhichpointtheyboughtaggressively.

thepullbackfromthebar23spikewouldnottypicallyhavemuchbuyingpressure
comparedtothestrengthofthebearspike.Theuncertaintycreatedbythebuying
pressure increased the chances of a trading range instead of a brief pullback and
then a protracted bear channel. Uncertainty is the hallmark of trading ranges and
notofbearflags(apullbackleadingtoabearchannel).
Thedistinctionbetweenaspikeandchanneltrenddayandatrendingtrading

range that began at bar 12 made the day a trending trading range day, it also had

dayoftenbecomesatrendingtradingrangeday,inpartbecausebydefinitionthat
first hour obviously was a trading range. The day often reverses back into and
sometimes through one or more of the lower trading ranges late in the day, as it
didhere.

Bar 2 was the first bar of a two-bar reversal up from a possible failed low 2 from
a double or triple bottom, and the start of a bull trend. Traders were aware that the
market could break out and run. Once the market broke out, it formed a higher range
from bars 4 to 6, and that range contained two small tight trading ranges. The high 2
long above bar 5 was a reasonable breakout pullback entry, despite the barbwire. The
breakoutwasbothfromthesmallbullflagfrombar3tobar4,andfromtheentirebar3
to bar 5 trading range, which was a two-legged sideways pullback from the breakout
abovebar1.

Other bulls who missed the move will aggressively buy the pullback, as will bulls
who want a larger position. The bulls will buy with limit orders at and below the
low of the prior bar, hoping that the current bar will fall below the prior bar and
allow them to buy a little lower. Other bulls will buy with stop orders above the
highofthepullbackbar(ahigh1buysignal).

about every buy signal that comes back and hits a breakeven stop and think that
this is a sign of a weak bull trend. They see that it is a bull trend and want to get
long, but can’t figure out how to do so, because they think every buy signal looks
bad. The pullbacks are too small and the setups are too weak. Also, since these

However, in a strong bear trend like this, you can short for any reason and just use a
wider stop. You could also go short below the bar 12 or bar 11 lows. In a strong bear
trend, you can sell below the lows of bars and below swing lows and expect to make
aprofit.
Bar 14 was an attempt to reverse up after the failed low 2 and was therefore the
third push up. The doji after bar 11 was the first push and bar 12 was the second. A

Sometimes, a trend from the open day opens on the highest tick of the day. In
Figure 23.8, bar 12 was the first bar of the day and it opened on its high tick and
broke out below the wedge from yesterday’s close. Most traders would not be
nimble enough to sell below the inside bar at the end of yesterday, but it would
be reasonable to sell a small position on the close of the first bar. If you missed

theentiremovedowntobar14wasaspike.Thetwobarsafterbar15formedanother
spike, which was followed by the channel that began with the bar 17 low 2 and ended
atbar19.
Bar 16 was also a breakout pullback from the breakout below bar 14 and bar 1. It
was also close enough to a breakout below yesterday’s low to behave like a pullback
from an actual breakout (close is close enough). The eagerness of the bears to short
prevented that first pullback from reaching the moving average. They were afraid that
it might not get there and therefore shorted so heavily on the approach that it never
reachedthemovingaveragetarget.Whenthepullbackturnsbackdownjustbelowthe
moving average, the bears are very aggressive and have a sense of urgency. They are
veryeagertoshort,evenatrelativelylowprices,solowerpricesarelikelytofollow.

Yesterday’s bull channel into the close poked above the trend channel line, which
was drawn as a parallel of the bull trend line from bar 5 to bar 9. Once the market
reversed back into the channel on the bar 12 first bar of the day, it was likely to poke

target is a measured move down. Use the height of the wedge (the bar 11 high minus
the bar 8 low) and subtract that from the bar 8 bottom of the wedge. This target was
exceededduringthesell-offbelowbar17.

Deeper Discussion of This Chart
In a strong trend such as that shown in Figure 23.10, you can buy for any reason
and at any time. Buying above pullback bars is reliable, but you can also place limit
orders to buy at or below the low of the prior bar. Shorting below bars is a loser’s
strategy. If you were to look for shorts, you should short only above the highs of
bars or at the close of strong bull trend bars. When a day is this strong, most traders

Bears saw bars 5, 7, and 9 as a three-push pattern and therefore a wedge variant,
and they then saw bars 7, 9, and 10 as another wedge. When the correction from a

Bar 14 coincided with a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report, and the
market sold off sharply but immediately reversed up after missing the bar 5 high by

Pullbacks happen when bulls take profits. Why do traders ever take profits
when a trend is strong? Because no matter how strong a trend is, it can have a
deeppullbackthatwouldallowtraderstoenteragainatamuchbetterprice,and

428 COMMONTRENDPATTERNS Figure25.2
Most trend resumption bear days do not have a large rally on the open, and that
large rally is an indication that the bulls were willing to buy aggressively today. Even
though the middle of the day was setting up perfectly for a big sell-off into the close,
you can never be certain and there is always about a 40 percent chance that the exact
opposite can happen. Another clue that the market might rally to test the open of the
day was that the low of the day was almost a perfect measured move down from the
openofthedaytothetopoftheinitialrally.Thatmeansthattheopenofthedaywasin
the middleof the day’s range. If the market could get backup there, the day couldbe
closetoadojiday,whichisfairlycommon.Noticehowthemarketrepeatedlytestedthe

eventually the buy programs overwhelmed the sell programs. All of those shorts had
to be bought back, and this added to the buying pressure. Also, many sell programs

this is a shrinking stairs pattern and indicates waning momentum. It often leads
toatwo-leggedreversalandatrendlinebreak.Manythree-pushreversalsqualify
as stairs or shrinking stairs trends that failed and reversed. Stairs are often just
pullbacksorflagsinhighertimeframetrends,anditiscommontoseestairsover
thefinalhourortwoofthedayandthenabreakoutoftheflagontheopenofthe

andthebeartrendcouldbreakouttomorrow.
Alternatively, one stair might suddenly accelerate and break out of the trend
channelinthewith-trenddirection.Ifitthenreverses,thisovershootandreversal
will likely result in at least a two-legged move. If it does not, the breakout will
probably continue for at least two more legs or at least the approximate height
of the channel in an imprecise measured move (the distance beyond the channel
shouldbeaboutthesameasthedistancewithinthechannel).
Traders pay attention to how many ticks breakouts run past the most recent
swing point,and then use thatnumber tofadesubsequent breakouts, expecting a
breakouttest.Forexample,ifthelastswinglowfell14ticksbelowtheswinglow

Figure26.1 STAIRS: BROADCHANNELTREND 433
FIGURE 26.1 BearStairs
A bear stairs pattern is a downwardly sloping channel where each breakout to a
new low is followed by a pullback that goes back above the breakout point. For
example, in Figure 26.1 the breakout leg below bar 6 down to bar 9 was followed
by a pullback that went back above the bar 7 low, and the rally after the leg that
brokebelowbar9downtobar13wasfollowedbyapullbackthatwentabovethe
bar9breakoutpoint,overlappingthepriorrange.
Some traders buy near the trend channel line and short near the trend line.
Other traders pay attention to how far a breakout goes before there is a pull-
back.Forexample,thelowofbar5wasaboutfourpointsbelowthelowofbar3.

low of bar 5. They were not filled on the sell-off to bar 7. However, as the market
fell below bar 7, they again placed limit orders to buy three to four points lower,
and were filled on the move down to bar 9, which had a low that was four points
below the low of bar 7. Since prior rallies were about four points, they took prof-
its at around three points above their entries. They did the same on the sell-offs
to bars 11 and 16. They tried on the sell-off to bar 13, but the market did not fall
