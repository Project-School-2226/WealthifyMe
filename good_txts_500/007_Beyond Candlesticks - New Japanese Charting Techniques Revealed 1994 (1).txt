A J"p"r,"se book that I had translated said that: charts are
frequently considered secretive. The number of people who know the
essentialso f these charts are few and reference material is scarce."l This
paucity of material was particularly true with some of the new techniques
revealed in the second part of this book. However, thanks to the help of
some important individuals, I was able to uncover many previously hid-
den aspectso f fapanese technical analysis.
Without the assistanceo f the translating done by Richard Solberg, it
would have been almost impossible to write this book-or my first one!
Not only did Richard ably do the translating, but equally important was
his tenacity in finding and obtaining the japanese books I needed for my
basic research. Richard has been one of my most vital resources.
As with my first book, I had the help of knowledgeable fapanese
traders who helped refine my knowledge by sharing valuable insights
obtained from their years of experience.
Mr. Hiroshi Okamoto, Director at Nomura Investment Trust, Mr. Ya-
suhi Hayashi, Senior Trader at Sumitomo Life Insurance, Mr. Nori Ha-
yashi, Investment Manager at Barclays Trust, and other members from
the Nippon Technical Analysts Association (NTAA) in |apan were all very
gracious. I am sure many of my questions may have seemed very rudi-
mentary to them, but they were patient and open about sharing their
knowledge. Without their insights, this book would be much less de-
tailed.
Mr. Kiyohiko Yoshizawa, vice president at Paine Webber, provided

valuable new facts and insights about the candles during our numerous
meetings.
One of my most important contactsw as Mr. Yoji Inata, a correspon-
dent for Reuters. Mr. Inata's assistancew as critical f<lr the new tools
addressedi n this book; we spent many hours together. Not only did he
take his valuable time to review some of the new techniques to make
sure I correctly understood the ideas, but he also took the extra step of
conferring with his ]apanesec olleagueso n points about which he was
not 100o/osu re. Mr. Inata said that he enjoyed our studying together. I
think he was being polite. Although I may have contributed to his knowl-
edgei n somer espects,f or the most part I was the student. I was fortunate
to have had a gracious, knowledgeable,a nd friendly teacher.
Thanks again goes to my friend, Bruce Kamich. A true professional,
he continues to provide me with a stream of insightful and helpful ideas.
The editor of this book, Susan Barry, was also the editor of my first
book. Susan had the foresight to see how brightly the interest in the
candlesw ould burn. She was a major factor in my choice of ]ohn Wiley
& Sons to publish this book. I hope Susan does not decide to move to a
publishing firm in the Antarctic. If I ever do a third book, I would have
to follow her.
"Where
As an English poet said: ignorancei s bliss, wisdom is folly."
Before writing my first book, I was blissfully ignorant of all the time and
effort that goes into such a project. That book, made me aware of how
difficult the processi s. Becauseo f this, I had no desire to go through it
all again. However, Dodge Dorland, Chief Investment Officer of Landor
Investment Management (New York, NY), gave me the push to do this
second book. Dodge uses candles to trade stocks on an intra-day basis
and has been one of the earliestp roponents of candles.A nyone who has
dealt with Dodge can vouch for his amiability and for his knowledge.
Many of the charts in this book are from the MetaStock software by
EQUIS International (Salt Lake City, UT). Without their assistancei n
providing me with the new software to draw the kagi, three-line break,
and renko charts, this book would be much less detailed. Their excellent
software, and helpful and knowledgeable staff makes MetaStock a plea-
sure to use. For those interested in finding out more about the MetaStock
software, there is a coupon included at the back of this book. The data
used for the Metastockc hartsw as from Dial-Data( Brooklyn, NY). I found
their data accuratea nd easily accessible.
I would like to thank Shahrokh Nikkhah whose early appreciation of
my work and desire to make available the many advantageso f candlestick
analysis to his clients brought about my joining his team where we offer
advisory and brokerage servicesa t Daiwa SecuritiesA merica. I would
also thank my colleague, Mark Tunkel for taking the time to help proof-

In this, as in my first book, you will seem any CQG charts (Glenwood
Springs, CO). They are a real-time graphics charting service. CQG was
among the first servicesi n the West to offer candle charts to their clients.
I have used their servicef or many years. The accuracyo f their data and
their support personnel, such as Steve Onstad in New York, make this
a premier real-time charting service. Their excellent worldwide reputation
is well justified.
Reuters Ltd. (New York, London, and Tokyo) have also provided
charts for this project. Their RTA technical analysis real-time charting
product offers some unique capabilities. I have had the pleasure of giving
a serieso f seminars for them throughout Europe. The fact that Reuters
has gone through the time, effort, and expenset o send me to Europe for
these seminars shows how committed they are in meeting the educational
needs of their clients.
My first book, lapaneseC andlestickC harting Techniquesw, as written

"Candlesticks "typing"
him Nison.") Evan is now four, and he enjoys
on my keyboard. I tell you this so that if there are typos, I now have an
excuse.M y daughter, Rebecca,is eight and very bright. I have jokingly
said that I wanted this book easy enough for a child to understand, so I
think I'll ask her to proofread these pages( yet another excusei f you find
any mistakes!).F inally, there is my loving and patient wife, Bonnie, who
understands that it is great to have written, but most difficult to write.
Final thanks go to those who provided another incentive for writing
this book-the credit card companiesa nd the bank that has my mortgage.

INTRODUCTION
A chart is like a map, the more information each one provides, the better
the chance of reaching your destination safely. Candle charts display a
more detailed and accurate map of the market than do bar charts. A
"It
Japaneseb ook that I had translated stated, is not an exaggerationt o
say that candlesticks are the best in the world and a very exquisite cre-
ation for charts."l This is because,a s detailed below, candle charts oPen
new avenues of analysis and offer many advantages over bar charts:
1. Candle charts will pictorially display the supply-demand situation by
showing who is winning the battle between the bulls and the bears.
Bar charts do not.
2. Like bar charts, candle charts will show the trend of the market, but
candle charts add another dimension of analysis by revealing the force
behind the move.
3. Bar chart techniques can often take weeks to transmit a reversal signal.
However, candle charts will often send out clues of imminent reversals
in one to three sessions.T he result is that candle charts often provide
the opportunity for more timely trades.
These are just some reasonsw hy the flames of interest in candle charts
grow ever brighter. In just a few years, candle charts have joined bar
charts and point and figure charts as a basic charting technique.
Candle charts are drawn using the same data as bar charts (the open,
high, low, and close), so they send all the same signals that can be found
ot but charts. Yet, as just discussed,t he candleso ffer many advantages
over bar charts, so using candle charts instead of bar charts is a win-win
situation. When you use bar charts you only get bar chart signals. But,
with candle charts you get all the bar chart signals, plus you gain the

unique and powerful insights provided by the candles. so, why use a
bar chart?
Becauset he ]apanesea re major players in most of the world's mar-
kets, there is strong interest in how the |apaneseu se their technicalst o
trade. Candles are the most popular form of technical analysisi n |apan.
The importance of the candles for the |apanese trading community is
illustrated in the following quote from the European magazine,E uroweek.
This article quotes an English trader who works at a Japaneseb ank. He
"All
states: the |apaneset radersh ere-and that's in the foreign exchange,
futures and equities markets-use the candles. It might be difficult to
work out the billions of dollars traded in London on interpretations of
these charts each day, but the number would be significant."2
Think about it: Although billions are traded every day based on the
candle chart signals, until recently we had no knowledge of how the
]apanesev iewed the market with their technicals.T his is hard to believe.
Knowing the candles and their other technical tools discussed in this
"What
book may help answer the question, are the |apaneseg oing to do
next?."
Yearsa go, I met with the head of technicala nalysisf or one of fapan's
largest life insurance companies (this fapanese trader wanted to meet
with me to learn how I used western technicalst o trade). IzVhenh e walked
into my office, he saw I had candle charts on my desk. In a surprised
"You
voice, he asked: know about the candles?." I respondedt hat I did.
I then asked if he used them. He told me that his company's top man-
agementw ould meet eachM onday to discusst he world markets.A t these
meetings, he would bring his candle charts to offer his technical views.
"How
Then he pointed to my candle charts and asked: many other
Americans know about this?." I said no one (this was before the publi-
"But
cation of my first book). He looked relieved. I then continued, I
"So,
will soon have a book out about it." many others will know about
this?," he asked in a disappointed tone. The point of the story is that
the Japaneset rader came to me to learn about how we, in the West, use
technicals.T he fapaneseh ave learned from us and they know almost all
of our technicalm ethods. In most of the candlestickb ooks and articlesI
have had translated from Japaneset o English, there was at least some
referencet o western technicalt echniques.A quote from one of the books
"To
I had translated stated, understand stocks it is not enough to know
the |apanesec hart methods . . . one must absorbt he best parts of western
technicals:a nd on top of that using the best parts of Japanesec harts to
make for a progressiveo utlook which is necessaryf or stock analysis."3

by the Japaneset o enhance our market knowledge.
An article about my work appeared in the lapan Economiclo urnal. Tn

information refined by generations to use; we afe learning from the Jap-
anese.
Chapter 2 shows how to draw the basic candle line, and delves into
some history of the candle charts. Later in that chapter, I show how a
single candle line can provide important market insights. Chapter 3 dis-
cussest he basic candle patterns. With the detailed descriptionso f these
patterns, those new to candlesa nd candlee xperts can discovern ew mar-

THE EXPLOSIVE INTEREST IN THE CANDLES
FF L here is a Japaneses aying, "A clever hawk hides its claws." For over
a century, the claws of Japaneset echnical analysis, that is candlestick
charts, were a secreth idden from the western world.
For those new to the exciting field of candlestickc harts, candlesticiks
the term used for Japan's most popular and oldest form of technical
analysis.T hey are older than Western point and figure and bar charts.
Amazingly, candlestickc harting techniques,u sed for generationsi n the
Far East, were virtually unknown to the West until I revealed them in
my first book, lapaneseC andlesticCk hartingT echniques.
I am pleased and proud that my first book has been credited with
revolutionizing technical analysis by igniting the flames of interest in the
candles.B efore its publication, few people in the West had ever heard
of a candle chart. Now, candle charting techniquesa re among the most
discussedf orm of technical analysis in the world!
Interest in candle charts has become so intense that the World Bank
in Washington, DC askedm e to addresst hem on the subject.T he world-
wide interest in these previously secret techniques are reflected in the
financial headlines below:

For over 70 years, the standard charting tools in the west have been
bar charts and point and figure charts. Yet, within a short time, candle
charts have now joined these as a basic charting tool. The rapidity with
which this has happened is a direct reflection of the candle's popularity
and value.
The groundswell of interest in the candlestickc harting has becomea
topic in the media. A TV show, TechT alk, on the business news cable
station CNBC is hosted by the famous technician, fohn Murphy. john
"What
told me that a viewer once called and askedh im, are those charts
that look like hot dogs?" What an interestinga nd amusingi dea, I thought,
to Americanize these charts by referring to them as hot dog charts. But
"candle
I guesst he term chart," thankfully, is here to stay.
I have had many wonderful compliments from famous traders and
analysts.H owever, the most endearing compliment camef rom a woman
"lf
who wrote, you ever have a down day, just remember there's a nice
little grandmother in Missouri who's in awe of your accomplishments."
This letter, besidesb eing so gracious, illustrates the universal appeal of
candles-from traders at the World Bank to a grandmother in Missouri.
The reason for the popularity of candlestick analysis is easy to un-
derstand. They can be melded with any other form of technicala nalysis,
they are applicablet o any of the markets to which technical analysis is
applied, and they provide market insights not availablea nywhere else.
Why this book? A renowned 16th-centurys amurai swordsman stated
"learning
that is the gate, not the house. You first have to go through
the gate to get to the house."
My other book, lapaneseC andlestickC harting Techniques,t ook you
to the gate. This book takes you to the house and has many new, excit-
ing, and effective techniques to improve your trading, investing, or
hedging.
Japanesec harting was considereda secret.H owever, I have managed
"secrets
to pry open the of the Orient" by exchangingi deas with many
Japanesetr adersw ho use candlesa nd by having many hundreds of pages
translatedf rom ]apanesei nto English. Lin Yutang, a noted Chinesep hi-
losopher, sagely noted that one gets a different flavor from reading the
sameb ook at different stagesi n life. Therefore, he says, all great books
can be read with profit and pleasurea secondt ime; I have found this to
be true.
In the time since the publication of my first book, I have reread my
original candlestick documents and have gleaned new insights. In ad-
dition, I have obtained and translated new ]apanesem aterial, have ex-

Overuiew
panded my dialogue with more fapanese technicians and, of course, have
continued to learn from my use of candles. I reveal these new and val-
uable insights in this book.
My first book focused on the futures markets. The candles have now
become so important that their popularity has spilled over from futures
into stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets from around the world.
As a result, this book will have many more of the charts than did my
other book.
At times, a single candle line can be important. The Japaneseh ave a
"With
saying, the fall of one leaf we know that autumn has come to the
world." In this sense,a single candle line may be the first sign of a market
turn. In this book, I will show how to use individual candle lines to obtain
clues about the market's health.
It has been very exciting to see the intense interest sparked by the
candles. However, it is often forgotten that the emergenceo f a candle
pattern is but one aspecto f trading. Other aspects,s uch as the risk and
reward ratio of a potential trade and monitoring where the candle pattern
appearsi n the overall technical picture, must also be considered.T his is
so important that I have devoted a chapter to these aspects.
In my continuing studies of ]apanese trading techniques, I have un-
covered three charting methods that are very PoPular in ]apan, yet are
unknown to the West. These charting techniques are called three-line
break charts, kagi charts, and renko charts. They are revealed in Part 2
of this book.
In the days of fur trading in the United States, there was a comPany
called the Hudson Bay Trading Company. Th"y were known for taking
risks and for careful preparation. Trading journeys were undertaken with
much excitement, but in caset he fur traders forgot anything, they would
camp out the first night just a few miles away from the company's head-
quarters. In other words, careful preparation spared the travelers poten-
tial difficulties.
In Chapters 2 and 3, I too provide careful preparation by providing a
primer on basic candle theory and patterns. For those new to candle
charts, these chapters will provide the groundwork for your candle chart
analysis.
Many of you are probably already familiar with the basics of candle
charts. With this in mind, Chapters 2 and 3 will also offer a deeper
knowledge of the candles by revealing new candle theories, techniques,
and tools. As a result, even those knowledgeable about candles will gain
new insights and pelspectives into the power of the candle charts. For
example, when I describe the candle patterns in Chapter 3, I will provide
a unique visual glossary of candle patterns. This method of drawing the
patterns will provide a dimension of candle pattern analysis that was

never before available. After you explore with me the beauty and power
of the candle charts, you will never be able to go back to a bar chart.
This book will be a self-contained unit. I will not go over all the candle
patterns; that is done in my first book. However, I will sometimes make
referencesto the more obscureo r rare patterns discussedi n my first book.
This is for the benefit of those who are familiar with all the candle pat-
terns. Do not worry if you have not heard of the pattern before; it will
not detract from the discussiono f the chart.
Numerous charts and exhibits will quickly and clearly make evident
how candlesc an enhancey our trading, timing, and investing. As shown
throughout the book, candles can be merged with any other form of
technicala nalysis. Consequently, I have included charts that show how
to fully utilize the candles' power alone, or when joined with other tech-
nical tools.
Just as important as the recognition of candle patterns is an under-
standing of the relationship of the candle patterns to the overall technical
picture. Chapter 4 focuseso n this vital, but often neglected, aspect. In
this chapter, I will addressh ow trading with the candlesm ust take into
account the risk and reward of a potential trade, the stop-out level, and
the overall trend. I will also address the value of adapting to changing
market conditions.
Before I discusst rading with candles, I want to clarify a few points.
In the futures market, selling short is as common as buying long. This is
not true in the stock markeU most equity traders look to buy. Conse-
quently, throughout this book when I use the term "bearish" or "sell-
ing" when discussinga stock, you should not think of necessarilyg oing
short. Instead, view it as an area to protect existing longs by such means
as selling covered calls, moving up protective stops, or offsetting all or
some longs.
But this book is about more than candles. In Part II I reveal the dis-
parity index, the three-line break, renko charts, and kagi. These tech-
niques, popular in Japan,a re virtually unknown in the west and, unlike
candle charting, little has been written about these techniques, even in
Japan.
The disparity index comparest he closet o a moving average.I t is used
in the same manner as dual moving averages,b ut it has an interesting
wrinkle to it. The three-line break, kagi charts, and renko charts are
popular among Japaneset raders. They are excellent technical tools for
determining the trend of the market.
Whether you use the techniques discussedi n this book individually
or in combination with one another, you will discover that they provide
dynamic advantagesf or those who make use of their tremendouJ poten-
tial.

HISTORY OF THE CANDLE CHARTS
rF
I Hg fapanesew ere the first to use technicala nalysist o trade one of the
world's first futures markets-rice futures. The Japaneses tarted trading
in this market in the 1600s.I nterestingly, the birth of the Japaneser ice
futures market was a consequenceo f the country's military history.
After a century of internal warfare among the daimyo ( Japanesef eu-
dal lords), General Tokugawa Ieyasu, who ruled from Edo (the ancient
name of Tokyo), won the famous battle at Sekigaharai n 1600.T his was
the battle that helped unify fapan. Tokugawa thereafterb ecameS hogun
of all ]apan. After his victory over the daimyo, General Tokugawa clev-
erly required that all the feudal lords live in Edo with their families. When
the lords returned to their respective provinces, the entire family stayed
at Edo as hostage.T he feudal lord's main sourceo f income was rice that
was collecteda s tax from the peasantsw ho worked their land. Sincet his
rice could not be transported from the daimyo's provinces all the way to
Edo, they set up warehousesi n the port city of Osaka to store their rice.
Becausea ll thesep owerful daimyo lived so closet o eacho ther in Edo,
they attempted to outdo one another in lavish dress,m ansions,a nd other
"The
luxuries. This was reflectedb y a popular saying at the time, Edoite
will not keep his earnings overnight." This showed that the daimyo in
Edo were seen as spendthrifts with an expensivel ifestyle. To maintain
this lifestyle, the daimyo sold rice from their warehouse in Osaka; some-
times thev even sold rice from future harvests. The warehouse would

issue receiptsf or this future rice. These were called empty rice contracts
("empty tice" since the rice was not in anyone's physical possession)
and they were sold in the secondarym arket. This was the beginning of
one of the world's first futures market.
Trading in rice futures engenderedm uch speculation,a nd it was from
this speculationt hat Japaneset echnical analysisw as born. The most fa-
mous trader in the rice futures market was Homma. Homma traded in
the rice futures markets in the 1700s.H e discoveredt hat although there
was a link between the supply and demand of rice, the markets were
also strongly influenced by the emotions of the traders. Becauseo f this,
there were times when the market perceived a harvest as different from
the actual. He reasonedt hat studying the emotions of the market could
help in predicting prices. In other words, he understood that there was
a differenceb etween the value and the price of rice. This differenceb e-
tween price and value is as valid today with stocks, bonds, and curren-
cies, as it was with rice centuries ago.
In the material I had translated, candle charts are often called Sakata
charts in referencet o the port city of Sakata,w here Homma lived. How-
ever, basedo n my research,i t is unlikely that Homma used candlec harts.
As will be seen later, when I discusst he evolution of the candle charts,
it was more likely that candle charts were developed in the early part of
the Meiji period in japan (in the late 1800s).
whether or not Homma invented charting is open to question. But
determining whether one person, in this caseH omma, createdc harts or
used them to trade is not too important. There is a tendency in the West
to be preoccupied with imposing authorship to one person. It is more
likely that the candle charts we know today and all the techniques as-
sociatedw ith them tended to be a processo f cumulative authorship by
severalp eople over many generations.E ven if he did not invent candle
charts, Homma understood that the psychologicala spect of the market
was critical to his trading success.A nd it appearst hat the earliestf orms
of technical analysis in Japan dealt more with the psychology of the
market rather than charts.
In the book, The Fountaino f GoId-The ThreeM onkeyR ecordo f Money,
"
purportedly written by Homma, the author states: After 60 years of
working day and night I have gradually acquired a deep understanding
of the movements of the rice market." The book then goes on to say:
"when
all are bearish, there is causef or prices to rise. when everyone
is bullish there is causef or the price to fall." This phrase echos what is
now called contrarian opinion, a tool important to so many traders. yet,
The Fountain of Gold-The ThreeM onkey Recordo f Money, was written in
1755.It is amazing that before America was a nation, the Japanesew ere
trading with contrarian opinion! The title had me perplexed for some

time. I did not understand the reference to the monkeys" in the
title. Then in some of my translated material, it said something about
comparing successfult rading to being like the three monkeys we all knew
as children-see, hear, and speak no evil. Then it dawned on me; the
title of the book, The Fountaino f Gold-The ThreeM onkeyR ecordo f Money,
"fountains
means that for traders to get to their of gold," they should
have the characteristicso f these three monkeys. Specifically:
"See
L. no evil"-when yolJ seea bullish (bearish) trend, do not get
caught up in iU consider it an opportunity to sell (buy).
In the Fountain of Gold, it states that there is always a rotation of Yang
(bullishness) and Yin (bearishness). This means that within each bull
market, there is a bear market, and within a bear market, there is a bull
market. This view may explain why fapanesec andlestick techniques place
so much emphasis on reversal, rather than continuation, patterns.
"Hear
2. no evil"-when vou hearb ullish or bearish news, don't trade
on it.
It may be safer to take a position after you determine how the market
reacts to a news item rather than initiating a trade when the news is
released. Bernard Baruch, the millionaire stock speculator and presiden-
"are
tial advisor, stated that what is important in market fluctuations not
the events themselves, but the human reactions to these events." Exhibit
2.L shows that how the market reactst o the news may be just as impor-
tant as the news itself.
The Iraqi War started in the first few days of August 1990.Y et, Exhibit
2.L shows that gold stalled at$425.T his $425levelw as gold's high earlier
in 1990. This failure to take out the prior high was in spite of the fact
that there was a Mideast War. Gold's failure to rally on suPPosedly
bullish news sent out volumes of information about the state of the mar-
ket. To wit, be careful of a market that fails to rally on bullish news. Note
that after this failure at$425, gold lost its luster as prices returned to their
pre-Mideast crisis price near $360 within two months.
"whispering
Also be aware of what the Japaneser efer to as tactics."
This is what they call the spreading of false news to trick others in the
market. Try to keep out of rumor buffeted markets. Isaac Newton once
"I
said, can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness
of people." Why get involved with the madnesso f people?
"Speak

do in the market.

prices. Th"y were named stopping charts becauset hat was where the
prices stopped by the end of the session. Stopping charts were drawn
with either diagonal lines or horizontal lines connecting the closes.
B. Pole chart-Its name is derived from the fact that the lines resemble
poles. This chart added the extra information imparted by showing the
range between the high and the low of the session.T hesel ines show not
only the direction of the move, but the extent of the move for each
session.
C. Bar chart-This is a combination of the stopping and pole charts.
D. Anchor chart-Named as such because it looks like an anchor.
Based on legend, these charts originated in the Kyoho Era (from 1716)
from the fact that the usual meeting place for rice traders was port cities.
The anchor chart was an important event in the evolution of charting.
With this chart, the opening price was now added and created a chart
with an open, high, low, and close. Just as important, and something
unique to fapanesec harts, was that the relationship between the open
and closew as pictorially displayed. The top and bottom of the anchor's
vertical line are the high and low of that session.T he horizontal line of
the anchor line is the open. The arrow of the anchor line is the close. If
the close is higher than the open, the arrow points up; if the close is
lower, the arrow points down.

E. Candle chart-The next improvement from the anchor charts was
the candle chart. Although they are shrouded in mystery, the candles
probably started in the early part of the Meiji period (from 1868).A s can
be seen in Exhibit 2.28, candle lines were a refinement of the anchor
chart. The use of black and white real bodies made analyzing the un-
derlying supply and demand situation visually easier to determine than
with the anchor charts.
With the arrival of the candle charts, Japaneset echnical analysis flow-
ered as people started thinking in terms of signals and trading strategies.
Patterns were developed and market prediction became more important.
Trying to forecast the market took on extra importance in the L870sw hen
the fapanese stock market opened.
As can be seen from Exhibit 2.2, bar charts were one of the ancestors
of the more evolved and productive candle charts. In essence,t his means
that since most of the West is still using bar charts, it is also using a less
evolved form of charting than the Japanesea re with candle charts.
CONSTRUCTION OF THE CANDLE LINE
The first step in using the power of candles is learning how to construct
the basic candle line. Exhibits 2.3. and 2.4 show that the candle line
consists of a rectangular section and two thin lines above or below this
section. We see why these are named candlestick charts; the individual
lines often look like candles with their wicks. The rectangular part of the
candlestick line is called the real body. lt represents the range between
the session'so pen and close.W hen the real body is black (e.g., filled in),
it shows that the closeo f the sessionw as lower than the open. If the real
body is white (that is, empty), it means the close was higher than the
oPen.

The Basics t9
The thin lines above and below the real body are the shadowsT. he
shadows represent the session'sp rice eXtremes.T he shadow above the
real body is referred to as the upper shadow and the shadow under the
realb ody is the lower shadow. Accordingly, the peak of the upper shadow
is the high of the sessiona nd the bottom of the lower shadow is the low
of the session.
Candle charts can be used throughout the trading spectrum, from
daily, to weekly, and intra-day charting. For a daily chart, one would use
the open, high, low, and close of the session.F or a weekly chart, the
candle would be composedo f Monday's open, then the high and low of
the week, and Friday's close.O n an intra-day basis,i t would be the open,
high, low, and close for the chosen time period (i.e., hourly).
Exhibit 2.3 shows a strong sessioni n which the market opened near
the low and closed near its high. We know that the close is higher than
the open becauseo f the white real body. Exhibit 2.4 illustrates a long
black candlestick.T his is a bearish sessioni n which the market opened
near its high and closed near its low.
The |apanesef ocus on the relationship between the open and close.
This makes sense;p robably the two most important prices of the day are
the open and close. It is therefore surprising that American newspapers
have openings for futures prices, but not for stocks. A member of the
Nippon TechnicalA nalysts Associationt old me that he found it unusual
that U.S. newspapers do not have opening stock prices; the Japanese
have the openings in their papers. He said that he did not know why
the Americans disregard the openings.
I would expectt hat just as almost all technicals oftware vendors now
carry candle charts, so it may be that as candles become more popular
in the equity market, newspapers may, by popular request, carry stock
openings. Until then, in order to obtain the data needed to draw the
candles( the open, high, low, and close)y ou need to use a data vendor
service.T hese servicesf urnish prices on disks or through modems. The
data supplied from a data vendor are then transferred into a technical
analysis software package that will draw the candles based on these
data.
A note of caution: Some data vendors who do not have the actual
opening price of a stock default to the prior session'sc lose as today's
open. This, in my opinion, is not valid. You must have the true open to
draw an accuratec andle line. Although an open on a stock will usually
not be much different from the prior close, there are some candle patterns
in which a higher or lower opening (compared to the prior close)g ives
valuablei nformation. A data vendor that includes actual opens on stocks
is Dial Data (Brooklyn, NY).

REAL BODY AND SHADOWS
While an individual candle usually should not be used alone to place a
trade, the size and color of its real body and the length of its shadows
can provide a wealth of information. Specifically,l ooking at a line's real
body and shadows gives a sense of the supply and demand situation.
This section will discuss this basic idea, and explain how to use real
bodies and shadows to get clues about the market's underlying strength
or weakness.B y using the candle lines discussedb elow, you may be able
to get an early and tentative indication of market direction.
THE REAL BODY
In ]apanese charts, even an individual candle line has meaning, and one
of the first clues about the vitality of the market is to look at the size and
color of the real body. To the |apanese, the real body is the essenceo f
the price movement. This is a critical and powerful aspecto f candle charts;
through the height and color of the real body, candle charts clearly and
quickly display the relative posture of the bulls and the bears.
This section will be segmented according to the decreasings ize of the
real bodies. The first part of this section will consequently focus on long
white and then long black real bodies. After these, attention is turned to
candles with small real bodies called spinning tops. These diminutive
real bodies display a market where the bulls and bears are in a tug of
war.
This section will conclude with candles that have no real bodies. These
candles have the same (or nearly the same) opening and closing. Such
candles, called doji (pronounced d6-gee), reflect a market in a state of
transition. Doji, as you will see later, can be an important market signal.
Long White Real Bodies
A long white real body is defined as a session that opens at or near the
low of session,a nd then closesa t or near the session'sh igh. The close
should be much higher than the open. For example, if a stock opens at
$40 and closes at $4ff/v it would not be a long white candle since the
opening and closing range were relatively close. For a long white candle
to have meaning, some Japanesec andlestick traders believe that the real
body should be at least three times as long as the previous day's real
body.

EXHIBIT 2.5. Long White at a Low Price Level
Long White at a Low Price Level
A single candle by itself is rarely sufficient reason to forecast an imme-
diate reversal. It could, however, be one clue that the prior trend may
be changing. For instance, as shown in Exhibit 2.5, a long white real
body at a low price range may be the first sign of a market bottom. A
long white candle shows that the ability to rise is virtually unimpeded
by the bears. The closer the close is to the high of the session,a nd the
longer the white real body, the more important the candle line.
Exhibit 2.6 shows that in late \991.,t his stock was stabilizing near $5.
The first sign that the bulls were attempting to take control was the
unusually long white real body at 1. Note how this real body was ex-
tended compared to the prior real bodies. However, an almost equally
long, but black real body (for information on black real bodies, seep age
29), on the week after candle L showed that the bears still had enough
force to offset the bulls' advance. In early \992, another unusually long
white candle, shown at2, appeared.T his white candle opened on its low
(sincei t does not have a lower shadow) and closed on its high (since it
does not have an upper shadow). Such a candle is exceptionallys trong,
notably when it is so elongated as in candle 2. Candle 3 was another
strong white candle that propelled prices to new multi-month highs. With
the tall white candles L and 2 both appearing near $5, we can see the
significanceo f that $5 support area. Consequently,w hen prices corrected
back to this level in fuly and August 1992, it is not surprising that the
selloff stopped near $5.
Long White Candle Confirms Support
As shown in Exhibit 2.7, the tall white candle that rebounds from support
underscorest he aggressivenesso f the bulls. A long white candle that
bounceso ff a support area such as a trendline, a moving average,o r a.
retracement level gives extra confirmation of that support.

The Basics 25
Long White Real Bodies as Support
Exhibit 2.11 brings out one of the more exciting uses of long white can-
dles, specifically, that long white candles can become support areas. I
have found this to be an excellent tool since it serves to alert traders to
support zones that are not available with bar charts. The depth of the
reaction should find support at either the middle of the long white real
body or the bottom of the entire white candle, including the lower
shadow. The Japanesel iterature says that a long white real body should
be support in a rising market. However, based on my experience,i t can
also be used as support in a falling market. The reason the market may
fall back after an exceptionally tall white real body is that prices may
become short-term overbought (that is, they rallied too far too fast). In
this scenario, the market may have to retrace some of the prior rally to
relieve this overbought condition.
In Exhibit 2.12, the huge white candle in early 1992 propelled prices
from $1012t o about $15. Almost a 50o/or ise in one week! After such a
move, it was not surprising that the market had to consolidate its gains.
Basedo n the precept that a long white candle is support, the middle of
the white real body (at the arrow), near $121/2s,h ould then be monitored
as support. The power of the market is well reflected by the fact that for
the rest of 1992,t he market held above this support area.

Exhibit 2.13 illustrates how the lower end of tall white bodies L-4
became support on corrections. Of interest is that the support line ob-
tained by extending the low of candle 3 was broken in September 1992.
Observe, however, that the sell-off stopped near the support area from
the low of candle2 . This chart also illustratesa n important point. Candle-
stick traders should wait, if possible, for the market to close under sup-
port to confirm a break. In this example, we see in mid-1992 that the
support level from the bottom of candle 3 was broken intra-weekly (see
X on the chart), as was the support by the bottom of candle 4 (seeY ).
Becauseth e weekll (i.e., the Friday) closeh eld abovet heses upport areas,
the support line was still in force.
Notice in Exhibit 2.14h ow the low of the long white real body in early
April (at the arrow) was 109-22. This means that area should provide a
base on sell-offs. In this exhibit we see the importilrce of waiting for a
close under a support area to confirm the breaking of support.

A method you could use with this concept of tall white candles as
support is to buy on a correction near the midpoint of the white candle.
From that level down to the bottom of the long white candle( this includes
the bottom of the lower shadow) should be support. If the bottom end
of the support zone (that is, the lows of the tallwhite candle) is pene-
trated on a close, then you should reconsider your long position. et
times, these support areas are broken on an intra-sessionb asis, but as
long as the support holds on the close, I still view it as valid support.
one of our institutional clients told me he found that, at times, after
a tall white candle, the market corrects.I advised him that such action is
not surprising since after such a candle, the market may be overbought
and hence vulnerable to a setback.I then suggestedt he use of a long
while candle as a support area in which he courd buy on a correction.
Coincidentally, on November 23, at the time the trader and I were talking
about this, the bond's first hour of trading had just ended. This first
hour, as shown in area 2 in Exhibit 2.1s, completed a tall white candle.
since he traded bonds, I informed the client that support should be from
the halfway point of this white candle down to the bottom of the candle,
including the lower shadow. I then pointed out that there was another
long while candle from the preceding day's first hour of trading (see
using the support Zone in a Tall white Candle December 1993B ond

candle 1). The bottom of that tall white candle (including the shadow)
was successfullyd efended as suPport with candle 2. Thus, there were
two white candles (at L and 2) that reinforced the support near \14-16.
Note how, after white real body 2, the market retraced about halfway
into it before rallying.
Long Black Real Body at High Price Area
just as a long white candle could be an early signal that the market may
be trying to build a bottom, so it is that a distinctively long black real
body at a high price may be a tentative warning of a top. The long black
real body should be significantly longer than the candles preceding it.
This is illustrated in Exhibit 2.16. Such a long black real body displays
that the bears had grabbed control of the market. The longer the rally
continued and the more overbought the market, the more reliable the
cautionary signal of this long black real body becomes.
The long white candle (1) in Exhibit 2.17 echoes a vibrant market.
However, there were a few warnings that Home Depot was overheating.
The first was that the relative strength index (RSI) was above 70o/oS. uch
a high RSI figure is a clue that the market is overbought. Another sign
that the bulls were losing their upside push was the series of small real
bodies following the tall white candle at 1. These small real bodies showed
that the supply-demand situation was more in balance as comPared to
tall white candle 1 (candle L showed that demand was overwhelming
supply). Small real bodies are discussedi n more detail later in this chap-
ter.
Falling black real body at 2 showed that the bearsh ad wrested control
of this stock. Note how black real body 2 was the longest black real body
since at least November 1992. This shouts out a warning that there is
now something very different about the market, and that appropriate
defensivea ction-such as selling coveredc alls, or offsetting somel ongs-
should be undertaken. For those who are familiar with all the candle
patterns, note how the tall white candle at 1 and the black real body at

was now a resistancez one that could be used to exit longs or to go short,
on a bounce to that resistance.
Exhibit 2.24 displaysa price explosion via a long white candle in late
1991'.U sing the theory of long candles, let us see how one could have
traded this market. A long white candle gives us a support area at 50o/o
within its real body. Consequently, a pullback to near the 50o/ore trace-
ment of the long white could be used as an early buying zone. This could
have been at areas 1 through 4. Now, we turn our attention to a price
-sup-
target. Notice the exceptionally bearish long black real body from
tember 1991(,a t the arrow). As discusseda bove, we would expecta raliy
to stall as it approachest he top of this black candle. Although the bulls
were finally able to gather enough force to breach this resistance of the
long black candle, it took them over a year to accomplish this. Thus,
buying on a pullback into the long white with a minimum target to
september's long black real body could have been an effective trading
strategy.

Size, Frequency, and Color of Real Bodies
The tone of the market can be gauged by comparing the relative height,
frequency, and color of a group of candle lines. The first sign of trouble
in Exhibit 2.25 came with the long black candle at L. Note how this is the
longest black candle in some time. Then, an aPPearanceo f an elongated
black candle at 2 was an evident warning sign of trouble. The price de-
scent continued until February's tall white candle at 3 arose. This was
the loftiest white real body in many months, and relayed that the bulls
had entered the market in force. Observe how the midpoint of February's
white real body became a base for a minor rally.
In the boxed section in Exhibit 2.26, we see a period in which the
market was trading laterally. With a bar chart, it would be difficult to
glean information about the relative strength of the bulls or the bears in
such an environment. With the candles,h owever, we can do this. In this
trading range environment, we can see that there were eight black real

than the white ones. With more and larger black real bodies than white
real bodies, the candlest ell us that the bearsw ere taking a more aggres-
sive stancet han were the bulls. ClassicW estern technical theory stated
that after a congestionb and, the market's trend should have resumed in
the same direction that it had before the congestion band. In this ex-
ample, the preceding trend was down. Thus, the bearish candle action
during the lateral range reinforced the classicw estern theory and in-
creasedt he odds of a continuation of the preceding downtrend.
In the next section, using information on how the open comparest o
the close will be discussed.B ut before that, I will discuss new ways of
interpreting candle patterns. This methodology will help illuminate the
theory and market action behind eachc andlep attern. Eachc andlep attern
in this book will be illustrated four ways (refer to Exhibit 2.22).
Exhibit 2.27 (B) The blended candle-If the candle pattern has more
than one candlel ine, you can combine them to make a single candle line,
which I call ablendedc andle.T his method is sometimesu sed in the ]ap-
anesec andlestickl iterature to help clarify whether a pattern is bullish or
bearish. The blended candle is an individual line that is a combination
of the open, high, low, and close of all the candle lines in the pattern.

EXHIBIT 2.27. Candle Pattern Analysis
As shown in Exhibit 2.27 (B), the blended candle is drawn using a four-
step process:
1. Use the open of the first sessiono f the candle pattern as the open of
the blended candle.
2. Use the high of the candle pattern (in other words, the top of the
highest upper shadow) as the high of the blended candle.
3. Use the low of all the sessionso f that pattern (i.e., the bottom of the
lowest lower shadow) as the low of the blended candle.
4. Use the close of the last sessiono f the candle pattern as the close of
the blended candle.
Based on the insight offered by the blended candle line in Exhibit
2.27, we can deduce that the two-candle combination in Exhibit 2.27 (A)
is a bearish combination. This is becauset he blended candle shows the
bearish aspectso f a long uPPer shadow and small real body near the
bottom of the range.
Exhibit 2.27 (C) Anchor charts-Those who draw the candle chartsb y
hand and are tracking many markets or are restricted in time may find
this task to be burdensome. One way to circumvent this (besidesb uying
software) is to consider using anchor lines instead of candle lines. The
anchor chart as previously discussed, is composed of the open, high,
low, and close. If the anchor is pointing uP, it means that the close is
higher than the oPen (with the arrow part of the anchor rePresenting the
close).A n anchor pointing down means that the closei s lower than the
oPen.
Although the anchor chart is less visual than the candle chart, it pro-
vides the same information and is faster to draw. The disadvantaget o
the anchor chart is that you don't have the quick color clue, as you do

with the candle's white and black real bodies. But you can draw up
sessionsi n red and down sessionsi n black (remember, however, that
unless you have a color printer, all the anchor lines will be black when
a hard copy is printed).
Exhibit 2.27 (D) Directional pattern Analysis-To clarify the market,s
path that unfolds during the candle pattern, I will draw arrows reflecting
the market's basici ntra-sessiona ction. I call this directionapl atterna nalysii.
The path shown by the market's action in the directional pattern anaiysis'
can be used as a rough method to gauge the overall price action during
the session.A lthough the arrow in the directional pattern analysis will
show the path taken by the market during the sessfon,i t will not show
the order of when these prices where touched.
For example,b ased on the relationship of the real body and shadows
of the first white candle in Exhibit 2.27 (A), we know that, at some time
during the session,p rices moved under the opening price. However, we
do not know when the price moved under the open. \Atrhileth e arrow in
Exhibit 2.27 (D) may make it appear that the market immediatelv moved
lower after the opening, it may not have unfolded that way. The market
instead may have rallied after the open and later in the sessionf ell under
the opening price. Thus, it is important to keep in mind that the direc-
tional pattern analysis should be thought of as a visual clue about the
relative price action of the open, high, low, and close compared to one
another. However, it does not tell us the sequenceo f that price action.
Opening Compared to Prior Real Body
A disadvantageo f candle charts is that they require the closet o complete
the candlel ine. There are some ways around this limitation. One t,.thod
is to go to a shorter time. In other words, if you are looking at a daily
chart, you can sometimesg et a signal on the hourly chart before the close
of the daily session.A nother mechanismt o bypasi waiting for the close,
and the one I will focus on here, is comparing the opening to the prior
real body.
Exhibit 2.28 (A) illustrates that if the opening is under the midpoint
^Con-
of the previous white real body, it could be a bearish scenario.
versely, if the next day's opening is above the black body's midpoint, as
shown in Exhibit 2.28 (B), it courd be viewed ur u poiitive sign. This
concept might be useful for those who are more aggressive" r,d ,irk-
oriented and would want to buy or sell on an opening rather than waiting
for a close.
This technique is more important for stocks than for futures. This is
becauset he futures market's higher volatility makesi t more likely for the

price to open away from the prior close (remember that for prices to open
above or below the prior real body's midpoint, it has to open away from
the prior close). However, for a stock, such an occurrence is rarer, and
as a consequence more significant.
The chart of Manville (Exhibit 2.29) gave three signals that it was in

(shadowsa re discussedi n detail in the next sectiono f this chapter). This

Manville opened under the center of the prior white real body. Final
bearish confirmation came the following week when the market gapped
lower.

above the midpoint of the prior black real body. This positive develop-

market is losing its momentum. For instance, if the market is at or near

that the bulls were unable to maintain the momentum of their advance.
The arrival of the spinning tops showed that the market was losing its
vitality. The black candles after the spinning top added more reason to
suspecta turn.
Accumulation and Distribution
One of the most powerful and important aspectso f candle charts is their
ability to meld themselves with any other form of technical analysis. Let
us, for example, uncover how one candle (the spinning top), combined
with volume, can provide critical information about the inner workings
of the market.
Two key conceptsr elating volume to price action are those of accu-
mulation and distribution. Accumulation occurs when, at a low price
level, there is a high volume session with stagnant prices. The high vol-
ume relays that the bears are attacking full force, throwing all their re-

sourcesa nd ammunition into the fray. But the stagnant prices during the
sessions how that the bears are unable to drag down prices. All that the
bears have tried to sell has been accumulatedb y the bulls. After such a
scenario,t he bears may either run out of ammunition of just give up.
The consequenceo f either of these is a rally.
Distribution is the opposite of accumulation. Distribution occursw hen,
at a high price level, there is heavy volume but virtually frozen prices.
"smart"
What is happening in such an environment is that the money
is thought to be distributing their supply to meet all the buying that is
entering the market. With distribution, the sellers are offering enough
supply to meet all the buyer's demand, thus keeping prices in check.
Distribution should therefore be viewed as a topping scenario.
Note that as part of the definition for either accumulation or distri-
bution, there must be little price movement. A spinning top reflects a
session in which there is little price action (as defined by the difference
betweent he open and the close).S o, by combining volume with spinning
tops, we can determine when there is accumulation or distribution.

nant prices and high volume at a low price level are classic signs of
accumulation.T he high-volume spinning top in this example shows that

reinforced by the fact that this spinning top sessionm ade a new low for
the move, yet the bears were unable to maintain these new lows.
In Exhibit 2.34, June's tall white candle sessionw as also a high-vol-
ume session.T his was a very bullish development insofar as the market
moved up sharply with strong buying interest (as gauged by the high
volume). However, what occurred in the next sessionw as causef or con-
cern. In that session, a small real body (i.e., a spinning top) emerged.
The volume on the spinning top session (circled on the chart) was not
as extreme as it was the prior day. Yet, looking back at the volume at
the bottom of the chart, we see that it was nonetheless a very high-
volume sessionc ompared to the prior periods. Consequently,t here was
a high-volume spinning top session. \rvhat does that tell us? The high
volume reflects a market in which the bulls came out in force, but the
small real body-the spinning top-means that the bearsw ere aggressive
enough to almost stalematet he bull's advance.T his action was a classic
sign of distribution. The small real bodies over the next few sessions

continued to echo the inability of the bulls to propel this market. Note
how the longest real bodies following the spinning top were black. This
showed that the bears had gained a foothold on the market.
Doii
One of the more important individual candlestick lines is the doji. As
shown in Exhibit 2.35, a doji sessionh as a horizontal line instead of a
real body. This is becausea doji is formed when the session'so pen and
close are the same (or almost the same). If the market is trading laterallv,
a doji is neutral. In essencet he doji is echoing, on a micro scale, the
indecision reflected on a more macro scale by the market's sideways
action. However, a doji that emerges after the mature part of an uptrend
or sell-off has a gteater chance of a market turn. At such a time, the
"a
Japaneses ay that a doji provides hint of tops and bottoms."
One should be especially cautious about a doji that arises after a tall
white candle which in turn aPPearsa fter a significant uptrend. This is
true whether the doji is within the prior long white real body or above
it. Such action representsa disparity about the state of the market. Spe-
cifical$, the rally and tall white candles during such a rally tell us that
the bulls are still in charge. But a doji means that the bulls are failing to
sustain the upside drive. This is shown in Exhibit 2.36.
How do you decide whether a near doji day (i.e., where the open
and closea re very close,b ut not exact)s hould be considereda doji? One
method is to look at a near doji day and compare it to recent action. If
there is a serieso f very small real bodies, I would not view the near dOji
day as significant since so many other recent periods had small real bod-
ies or doji. (Other methods are covered in my first book).
As mentioned before, a doji is meaningful when it arises after a tall
white candle during an uptrend. In this scenario,t he market is consid-

"tired."
ered by the Japaneseto be Also, as shown in Exhibit 2.37, the
top of a doji session( that is, the top of the upper shadow) often repre-
sents resistance.H owever, if the highs of the doji sessiona re exceeded,
then the market's uptrend should continue. This is discussedi n more
detail below.
A common mistake among those who use canctesi s to use a doji as
an outright buy or sell signal. This is not correct. The doji indicates, as
"a
the japaneses ay, crossroadsb etween the bulls and the bears." While
the doji can mean the market may reversei ts prior trend, traders should
view the doji as echoing a market in transition rather than being an
outright reversal pattern. Based on this, traders should wait until the
next sessiono r two after the doji to show them which way the market
will move.
If there is a doji during a rally, and if the market continues strong
after this doji, it is a bullish indication sincet he market has resolvedi tself
from the state of transition (as shown by the doji) to its new trend-up.
Thus, while a doji that appears after a rally could be an indication of a
reversal( sincet he market is at a crossroads),i t is best to wait for bearish
confirmation over the next day or two to get a top reversalc onfirmation.
For those who sell on a doji, the doji should act as resistance( seeE xhibit
2.37). If the market closesa bove the high of the doji, the japanese say
"refreshed."
the market has become Based on this, a buy stop should
be placed above the high of the doji. The opposite would be true with a
doji in a downtrend. To wit, a doji in a downtrend shows that the market
is at a point of indecision, and a white candle after such a doji shows
that the market has resolved itself to the bull side. A buy based on the
doji after a downtrend should have a sell stop under the doji's low (in-
cluding the lower shadow). This is becauses uch a scenarioi s viewed as
a bearish continuation signal.
one of the most fascinating aspectsa bout candle charts is that, in
spite of their underlying simplicity, they provide so much valuable in-
formation about the state of the market. For example, what is more il-

lustrative of a market in balance than a doji? That simple, individual
candlel ine relays how a market is in a state of balanceb etween the bulls
and bears. As a result, the market may be at a transition point. All this
information in one candle line!
An important aspecta bout doji (the plural of doji is also doji) is that
traders should look at where the doji appears in a trend. Exhibit 2.38
shows a doji in relation to the trend. As in Exhibit 2.38(A),t he appearance
of a doji after a steep advance or in an overbought market could be a
top. However, as shown in Exhibit 2.38(8), if the market just started to
rise, it indicates there is less of a chance that the market is at a top. In
Exhibit 2.38(C)w e see how the emergenceo f a doji after a precipitous
decline could mean a bottom. Exhibit 2.38(D)d isplays a market that has
just begun to fall. In this scenario,p rices may continue their descente ven
after a doji. The main concept behind Exhibit 2.38 is that doji become
more important as a reversal signal the more overbought or oversold the
market.
In Exhibit 2.39,w e notice a rally that startedi n early November stalled
after two doji following a tall white candle. The appearanceo f these doji
told of a market in which the bulls and bears were in equilibrium. This
was very different from the prior session when the tall white candle

early 1993r ally.
The arrow in Exhibit 2.40 points to a doji sessioni n which the open,
low, and close are at the bottom end of the session'sr ange. This doji is
known as a gravestoned oji. A gravestoned oji looks like a wooden me-
morial used in Buddhist funerals that is placed at a gravestone.I t is said
that those who buy at a high price level after this doji will die and become
ghosts. (Thosef amiliar with candle patterns will note how this doji was
part of a classic evening doji star pattern [this pattern is discussedi n
Chapter 3l).
Exhibit 2.41 shows how the small real bodies at 1 and the doji at 2
warned that the market was losing its upside drive. After trading in a
lateral range for a few weeks, prices ascendedt o new highs in late ]an-
uary. However, there were two clues that the rally might not be sustain-
able. The first was the doji at 3. This showed that, although the market
had reachedn ew highs, the upside drive had stalled. Another clue was

SHADOWS
While the real body is often considered the most important segment of
the candle, there is also substantial information to be gleaned from the
length and position of the shadows. Thus, the location and the size of
the shadow should also be considered when analyzing the psychology
behind the market.
A tall upper shadow is especially important when it appears at a high
price level, at a resistance area, or when the market is overbought. This
is becauses uch a candle line would hint that there is either heavy supply
entering at higher prices or an evaporation of buying. In either case (see
Exhibit 2.42), a long upper shadow could be a bearish development. A
long lower shadow candle that bounces from a support area, or appears
in an oversold market, could be an important clue that the bears are losing
control.

following the tall white candle. Remembering the concept that the doji

the next two weeks. The two candlesa fter the doji had long upper shad-

In either case, these long lower shadows showed a dampening of the
rallying strength. Further evidence of the importance of this resistance
was the failure there in mid-1992.

solidity of the support and the eagernesso f the buying. Also important

the bears tried to break prices under 59c and they failed. In general, the
longer the base, the more solid the scaffolding on which a rally can be
built.
A popular moving average among futures traders is the 65-day mov-
ing average. This line often swerves as support or resistance. For ex-
ample, note how in Exhibit 2.45 that it was support in early November
and again in early |anuary. The test of this support in early fanuary via
long lower shadows, shows how strongly and quickly the market sprang
from there. For those who are familiar with candles, the first long lo*",
shadow candle is a hammer. Hammers will be explained in the next

High-Wave Candles

Thesei nclude the dark cloud cover and two gapping black candles.T he
final section in this chapter will address those candle patterns, such as
the evening star and record sessions,w hich have three or more candle
lines.
SINGLE CANDLE LINES
In Chapter 2, I detailed how the length of the shadows can relay infor-
mation about the resiliency of the bulls or the bears. For example, a long
upper shadow echoes the ability of the bears to regain control of the
market during a rally. A long lower shadow pictorially reflects the bulls'
ability to rally the market after the market's new sessionl ows have been
made.
In this section, the single candle lines I will be describing (the ham-
mer, hanging man line, and the shooting star) either have a long upper
or lower shadow. But, becauset hey also possesst he important aspecto f
having a small real body near the top or bottom of the trading range,
these candles lines take on increased importance when using candle
charts.
The Hammer
As shown by Exhibit 3.1-,t he hammer, with its long lower shadow and
a close near or at the high, is easily understood to be a bullish signal.
"hammer" "hammering
The term derivesf rom the fact that the market is
out a base," or that a bottom is so solid that it does not break, even
when a hammer knocks away at it.

==================================================

The Patterns 57
An aspect of the hammer is that it must appear after a significant
downturn or in an oversold market to have significance.T he hammer is
a reversal indicator, and as such, should have a downtrend to reverse.
A hammer that appears after a fall of, say, two or three days is usually
not important. Since the hammer is most useful after a significant down-
turn, it should be noted that there may be selling on a rally from the
hammer. As such, the first bounce from the hammer may fail and the
market may return to test the hammer's support.
Consequently,t rading with the appearanceo f a hammer depends on
a trader's aggressivenessa nd risk adversity. Some traders may decide to
buy immediately after the hammer appearsi n caset he market does not
pull back to retest the hammer. Some traders may decide to wait to see
if the market returns to the hammer, and if so, will buy on that return
move. If the market successfullyt ests the hammer's support area, there
is then a more solid support areaa nd a better chancef or a rally. A method
that I sometimesr ecommend to our clients is to lightly test the waters
from the long side after a hammer, and then add the remainder of the
long position after (and if) there is a successfult est of the hammer.
Whichever methodology is used, a stop (based on the close) could be
placed under the lows of the hammer.
Exhibit 3.2 displays a classich ammer in that the extreme length of
the lower shadow reflectsh ow aggressivelyt he bulls were able to propel
prices off the lows of the session.T he bounce from this hammer stalled
during the next few sessions.B ut the pullback held the hammer's sup-
port. This action helped enlarge the base upon which to build a more
substantial rally.
A trading tool that I find useful with candles is a Western technique
called a spring.A s shown in Exhibit 3.3, a spring occursw hen the bears
are unable to hold prices under a broken support area. Becauses uch
action proves that the bears were unable to grab control of the market
when they had their chance, it should be viewed as a bullish develop-
ment. The opposite of a spring is an upthrust.A n upthrust occursw hen
the market makes a new high, but then fails to hold that high. Upthrusts
"The
will be addressed in the section titled Shooting Star" later in this
chapter. (Springs and upthrusts are describedi n detail in my first book.)
An ancient oriental book on military tactics referred to gaining an
"moving
advantageo ver the enemy by acting as a shadow." This term,
asu sed by the warrior who wrote that book, meanst hat when you cannot
see the state of your opponent, you pretend to make a powerful attack
to uncover the intention of the enemy. This concept,a s related to trading,
is one of the reasonsa spring is so important.
Probes of support or resistancea reas are attempted throughout the
markets by large-scalet raders. They want to discover how the market

will react once a support or resistancea rea is pierced. In effect, these
"moving
traders act like the aforementioned shadow," testing the bat-
tlefield by entering a large order to try and break support (or resistance).
For example, if a large-scalet rader places a sell order as the market gets
near support, their sell order may be enough to drag prices under the
"moving

about the underlying strength of the market. If the market fails to hold

EXHIBIT 3.4. Hammer and a Spring, Gold-Weekly
In Exhibit 3.4, we seeo ne of the more powerful combinationso f East-
ern and Western technicals-a hammer and a spring. The 1993l ow was
formed by a hammer. This hammer was also a spring since the low of
the hammer's lower shadow stightly punctured a support zone, but
sprang back above this broken support line. Also of interest in this chart
is that the high made near $360i n mid-1992rwasf ormed by a doji follow-
ing a tall white candle.
The Hanging Man
As shown in Exhibit 3.5, a hanging man has a very long lower shadow,
a small real body (white or black) near the upper end of the trading range
and little or no upper shadow. This is the same shape as the hammer
"If
line. However, as expressedi n the Japaneseli terature, it appearsf rom
below, buy, and if appearsf rom above, sell."
This phrase means that the same shape line can be bullish or bearish,
"from
depending on where it appears in a trend. If this line appears
below," that is, during a decline, it is a bullish hammer. However, if this
"from
same shape line appears above," that is, during an uptrend, it is
a sell signal and is referred to as a hanging man line.

EXHIBIT3 .5. The HangingM an I
Thus, the hanging man line is a top reversal signal that must arrive
during a rally, while the hammer is a bottom reversal line that must
appear during a decline; the same line can be bullish or bearish, de-
pending on the trend preceding it. In this context, it is interesting that
the japaneseh ave two words for rice. They call it either "raislJ,, oi ,,go-
han." Raisu is the |apanese term for rice when it is prepared westJrn
style. The term "raisu" even sounds like the western word "rice.,, Go-
han alsom eansr ice, but it is rice prepared japaneses tyle. In other word.s,
the Japaneser efer to the exact same product-rice-by different names.
\tVhat surrounds the rice determines whether the rice is referred to as
raisu or gohan. So it is with the hammer and hanging man. whether the
candle line is a bullish pattern (the hammer) or a bearish pattern (the
hanging man) is dependent on what precedest he line.
with the hanging man's long lower shadow reflectingb uying interest,
it may seem that the hanging man is a bullish signal. However, the
hangman's action shows that once the market has fallen, it has become
very fragile. The small teal body of the hanging man also shows that the
prior uptrend may be in the processo f changing. Becauseo f the bullish
action of the hanging man session( during the sessiont he market sells
off and then rallies by the close),a n important aspecto f the hanging man
lines is that there should be bearish confirmation. A common method of
bearish confirmation of a hangman is to wait to see if the next session,s
closei s under the hanging man's real body. This is shown in Exhibit 3.5.
The reasonf or the importance of this confirmation has to do with the
fact that the hanging man's long lower shadow shows that there is still
rising power left in the market. However, if prices fall under the hanging
man's real body, it translatesi nto the fact that everyone who bought at
the open or close of the hanging man sessioni s now losing money. In
such a scenario,t hese longs may decide to liquidate, and by doing so,
may engender a further weakening of prices.

EXHIBIT 3.6. Confirmation of
I a Hanging Man, German
Bund-Daily
FteutersG raphics
DC, some of their traders have asked my opinion on candle patterns on
various markets. One of their traders asked what I thought about the
chart of the German Bund shown in Exhibit 3.6. She asked my opinion
on April 10 after the hanging man was formed. I explained to her that if
the hanging man were confirmed by a weaker sessiont he next day, the
outlook would be bearish. In this case,t he market confirmed the bearish
hanging man during the next session.
Exhibit 3.7 shows how important it is to wait for confirmation of a
hanging man session. In that chart, we see a hanging man. However,
note how the following week the bulls pushed prices above the high of
the hanging man. This meanst hat those who bought during the hanging
man sessionn ow have a profit. Consequently, there is little reason for
them to liquidate their longs. The result is that a higher close than the
hanging man sessionv oids any of the bearish potential of the hanging
man. That is what happened here as the market exceededt he hanging
man session.A lso of interest in this chart is that in April 1992,t here was
a hammer that was also a bullish spring, since the hammer made a new
low which failed to hold.
An article about my work with candles in The Wall Streetl ournal dis-
played the chart shown in Exhibit 3.8. In this article, I discussedh ow the
hanging man at $40 helped confirm a top. I explained that before the
1990M id-east crisis, the highest crude oil futures reached was around
$32 (crude oil futures began trading in 1983).O nce the market exceeded
that level, I had a target at around $40. That was a resistancea rea in the
cash market back in 1979.N ote that at the $40 area, there was a bearish
candle signal via the hanging man line. The market retreated from this
g40level and tested a support line. It then rallied and, with sort of a last

confirmed with the mid-Decemberh anging man session.T he long black
real body, also near $20, on December 28, showed that the bears had
taken control.
The Shooting Star
A session with a long upper shadow and a small real body near the
bottom end of the trading range is called a shootings tar (seeE xhibit 3.11).
|ust as the long lower shadow of a hammer is bullish, so the long upper
shadow of the shooting star is bearish. The long upper shadow *eit s
that the bearsh ave been able to sharply drag pricesb ack from their highs.
In Exhibit 3.12,w e seeh ow the mid-August shooting star,sl ong ulper
shadow reflectedt he aggressivenesos f the bears.F ollowing this shooting
star, another symptom of market uncertainty came with ihe high-wave
candle. The fact that the shooting star and the high-wurr. .u.,lle both
appearedn ear the psychologicallyi mportant 100 area reinforced the im-
portance of those signals.
In Exhibit 3.13, I show how a support areaf rom late August (marked'

tober failure of this resistancea reaw as via a shooting star. The long upper
shadow of this line reflected the heaviness of supply towards the-1^.66
level. Another attempt to breach 1.66f ailed in eariy october with a long
black real body.
In the section on hammers, I discussedt he concept of springs (when
the price springs back abovea broken support area)u tra tnui the opposite

3. Although this has the correct shape of a hammer or hanging man line
(a long lower shadow with a small real body near the highs of the
session),c andle 3 is neither a hammer nor a hanging man. This is
becauset his line did not aPPear during an uptrend or a downtrend,
but was in the middle of a trading range. Thus, line 3 is not a hammer
(although the long, lower shadow could be viewed as a positive sig-
nal).

during the next sessionb y a closeu nder the hanging man's real body.
In line 7, we can see a small uppef shadow. If the uPPer shadow is
relatively small, it is still considered a hanging man. (A small uPPer
shadow is also allowable with a hammer.) Note how the real body of
the hanging man can be white or black.
5. This line has the correct shape of a shooting star (a tall uPPer shadow
and a small real body at the lower end of the session'sr ange). How-
ever, since it does not appear after an uptread, it does not have the
bearish implications as would a traditional shooting star.

6. This particular hammer should be viewed as being relatively unim-
portant since it appearedo nly after a minor downtrend. It did, how-
ever, show, via its long lower shadow, a successfult est of a support
area near $43 from the late |anuary and early February lows.
To summerize, always look at the preceding trend to determine if the
hammer, shooting star, or hanging man lines should be acted upon.
Remembert hat as reversal signals; they need a prior trend to reverse.
DUAL CANDLE LINES
In the preceding section, I looked at individual candle lines. In the re-
mainder of this chapter, I will review some of the more important or
common candle patterns that are comprised of two or more candle lines.
Dark Cloud Cover
A dark cloud (shown in Exhibit 3.17) shows, as the Japanesee xpressi t,
that the market has a poor chanceo f rising. The dark cloud cover's first
candle is a strong white session.D uring the next session,t here is buying
pressurel eft over and the market opens higher, but later in that session,
prices decline as the market closesu nder the center of the previous ses-
sion. This pattern reflectsa period in the market when the upward power

upper shadow. In other words, the dark cloud cover displays pictorially
a time in the market in which selling Pressure is exceeding the buying
pressure.
An ideal dark cloud cover's second session should close under the
midpoint of the prior white candle. If the black candle does not close
below the halfway point, it is consideredb y some fapaneset raders to be
an incomplete dark cloud cover. In such cases,i t is best to wait for con-
firmation during the next session in the form of a weaker close. As a
generalr ule, the deepert he closeo f the dark cloud cover's seconds ession
pushes into the white candle, the more bearish the signal.
A dark cloud that fails to move under the center of the prior candle
is shown in Exhibit 3.18. Looking at the blended candle in Exhibit 3.18,
we seeh ow there is less of an upper shadow than in the caseo f the more
classicd ark cloud cover's blended candle shown in Exhibit 3.17. This
means the dark cloud cover in Exhibit 3.18 may be less bearish than a
standard dark cloud cover. This is why there should be confirmation by
further weakness after the type of dark cloud cover shown in Exhibit
3.18.
There is a difference in how I would view the dark cloud cover in
stocks and futures. The ideal dark cloud cover has the second session's
open above the high of the prior session.S ince there is generally higher
price volatility in the futures market as compafed to stocks,i t meanst hat
I am more flexible about the definition of a dark cloud cover with stocks
than with futures. Specifically, with stocks I still view it as a dark cloud
cover if the second sessiono pens above the prior session'sc lose,r ather
than its high. This is shown in Exhibit 3.19.

However, if the seconds essiono f the dark cover of a stock does open
above the prior session'sh igh (instead of its close),i t would be more of
a potential reversal signal. This is becausei t is more bearish if the market
reverses after failing from a new high than it is if the market fails from
an area that was not a new high.
A dark cloud cover often becomesr esistance.I n Exhibit 9.20, we see
a dark cloud cover in late |anuary near 975.50.T he market retreatedf rom
there until a hammer (that was also a spring) formed near 969 in Feb-
ruary. The rally from this hammer stalled in March at the resistances et
by the dark cloud. However, as with any form of technicala nalysis,t here
should be a price at which you should reconsidery our original outlook.
For a pattern like the dark cloud cover, if the market closes above the
high of the dark cloud cover, the chancesa re that the market will continue
its upward path. In this example,o bserveh ow the market not only closed
above the high of the dark cloud cover in late March, but did so via a
bullish rising gap. Another interesting aspecto f this gap is that the ses-

downside breakout. However, those who went long while the market
was within that early November trading band were in a losing trade when
prices broke under the bottom end of the congestionb and. This means
that if the market rallies back up to the congestionb and, those longs may

The Piercing Pattern
As shown in Exhibit 3.23, the piercing pattern is the opposite of the dark
cloud cover. The dark cloud cover appearsa fter an uptrend, and is com-
prised of a black real body that closesw ell into the prior white body. The
piercing pattern is a white real body that closesw ithin the prior black
real body. This pattern shows that there is fierce buying at lower levels.

lhe Patterns 75
It has been my experience that dark cloud covers are more prevalent
than are piercing patterns. Part of the reason may have to do with an old
"In
Wall Street saying, on greed, out on fear." Although both greed and
fear are strong emotions, I think many would agree that of the two, fear
is the one that could cause the most volatile markets. During market
bottoms, traders or investors usually have the opportunity to wait for an
opportunity to enter the market. They may bide their time and wait for
a pullback or for the market to build a base, or to see how the market
"I

In Exhibit 3.25 we seet hat an advancet hat started in late 1991s talled
at the doji following the tall white candle. The extended upper shadow
in May echoed the importance of the resistancea rea set by this doji. The
market then retreated until August's piercing pattern. The piercing pat-
tern was also at a support area based on a 50o/or etracement of the rally
from the Decemberl ow to the May high. The 50o/ore tracementa rea should
be closely monitored by traders because such retracements are widely
watched by technicians. This pattern became support that was held in
October with a high-wave candle. The rally from this base near $33 stalled
at another doji following a tall white candle in early 1993.

The Engulfing Patterns
An engulfing pattern is a two candle pattern. A bullish engulfing pattern
(shown in Exhibit 3.27A) is formed when, during a downtre"d; ; white
real body wraps around a black real body. A bearish engulfing pattern
(Exhibit 3.278) is completed when, during a rally, a black real Lody en-
velops a white real body.
The engulfing pattern visually shows how the opposing forces had
gained control of the market. For example, a bullish engulfing pattern
reflectsh ow the bulls have wrested control of the market from the bears.
A bearish engulfing pattern shows how a superior force of supply has
overwhelmed the bulls. The ]apaneses ay that with a bearish engulfing
"the
pattern, bulls are immobilized." we previously saw how with the
dark cloud cover, the bearsw ere able to move prices into the prior white
real body, but with the bearish engulfing patterns, the powut of the bears
was such that they were able to pull the close under the entire prior
white real body. The same concept can be used to compare a pieicing
pattern to a bullish engulfing pattern. With the piercing pattern, the bulls
counterattacks trongly enough to push the closeo f the secondw hite real
body well into the prior black real body. However, with the bullish en-
gulfing pattern, the bulls' strength is that much greater since the close
of the white candle sessioni s above the top of the prior black real body.
Although this generally means that the bearish engulfing pattern is more
bearish than a dark cloud cover, and a bullish engulfing pattern more
bullish than a piercing pattern, it is equally important to seew here these
patterns emergeb efore deciding which is more important. For instance,
a piercing pattern that confirms a major support area should be viewed
more likely as a bottom reversal signal than a bullish engulfing pattern
that does not confirm support. This vital aspect of viewing the candle
patternsi n conjunction with the overall technicalp icture will be discussed
in depth in the next chapter.
The basic definition of an engulfing pattern is that the second real
body must engulf an opposite color real body. However, not all engulfing
patterns are equally important. The importance of the engulfing pattern

is dependent on the relative size of the real bodies, the relationship of
the shadows to one another, and other factors. For example,t he strictest
definition of an engulfing pattern would be if the first candle is small and
the second candle very large, and the second real body wraPs around
the entire first candle-including its shadows. The next strictest definition
would be if the shadows of the second candle exceededt he shadows of
the first candle (in other words, on the second day of the engulfing
pattern, the market made a higher high and a lower low).

As with a dark cloud cover, if the market surpassesa n engulfing
pattern, it is said to go opposite to the pattern. This means that if prices
closea bovet he top of the bearish engulfing pattern (including the upper
shadows), the outlook turns from bearish to bullish.
Aspects addressedi n this section's charts include:
1,. how engulfing patterns become support and resistance;
2. how an engulfing pattern can be combined with Western technical
tools;
3. why traders should be more flexible in defining an engulfing pattern
with stocks compared to futures;
4. the importance of comparing the size of the two real bodies of the
engulfing pattern;
5. the danger signal of a bearish engulfing pattern after a doji.
In Exhibit 3.28,t he first sign of trouble was with the high-wave candle
in late August. During the first two sessionso f September,m ore trouble
arosew ith a bearish engulfing pattern. The market backedo ff from there,

this gap stalled at the resistancea rea set up by the bearish engulfing
pattern.
Exhibit 3.28 also displays how the candles can offer reversal signals
not availablet o those using Western technical tools. With Western tech-
nicals, there is a reversal signal called a top outside reversal session,
sometimesa lso known as a key reversal. This occurs when prices make
a new high for the move and then closel ower than the previous session's
close. Note how in the bearish engulfing pattern highlighted in the
S & P was not a reversal sessions ince the second sessiono f this bearish
engulfing pattern (i.e., the black candle) failed to make a new high for
the move. Yet, becauset he black candle enveloped the white candle, it
was a bearish engulfing pattern. Consequently,w hile no reversalp attern
was revealed with western technicals,t here was a reversal with candle
charts.

selloff from A to B.
Becauses tocks often open relatively unchanged from the prior close
(as compared to the futures market), there should be more flexibility in
defining an engulfing pattern with stocks than with the more volatile
futures markets. Specifically, I still view it as an engulfing pattern if the
open of the seconds essiono f the candle pattern is the same as the close
of the first candle. This is shown in Exhibit 3.31.
Exhibit 3.32 shows an example of a bullish engulfing pattern in which
the open and the close were about the same. The importance of this
pattern was reinforced by the fact that it became support during the April
L993p ullback.
When looking at an engulfing pattern, you should consider the rela-
tive sizes of the real bodies that form the pattern. An ideal bearish en-
gulfing pattern has a very large real body enveloping a small white real
body. The diminutive size of the first small body of a bearish engulfing
pattern shows that the momentum of the prior rally is slackening. The
large black real body after this small candle then proves that the bears
have overwhelmed the bulls.
However, if there are two almost equal size candles that comprise the
engulfing pattern, the market may move into a lateral band, rather than
reverse( this concept may be useful for options traders who are looking
to sell volatility). I will use Exhibit 3.33 to illustrate this important con-
cept. In this deutschem ark chart, there was a bearish engulfing pattern
in ]uly 1992( 1.o n the chart). Note how the white and black candlesw ere
about equal in height. The fact that they are about equal means that the
bears and the bulls are about equally strong. With no clear-cut victory of
the bearso ver the bulls, it should not have been unexpectedt o seep rices

pattern at 2.
The bearish engulfing pattern at 2 was more significant with its small
white real body and massiveb lack real body. It was thus more likely to
Presagea price turn rather than a move into a lateral environment. This
engulfing pattern then became a resistance area.
Exhibit 3.34 displays a bearish engulfing pattern in early 1ggr. Note
how the white and black candles were about equal. As just discussed,
this could mean a period of consolidation;t his is what unfolded as prices
moved into a lateral trading band. The highs of this bearish engulfing
pattern set up a resistance area that was confirmed by a long upper
shadow. Another bearish engulfing pattern appeared in octobet iggz.
Becauset he october bearish engulfing pattern had a very large black real
body and a small white one, it was more important than the prior en-
gulfing pattern. Even more portentous with the october engulfing pat-
tern was that it followed a doji. Specifically, if there is a bearish engulfing
pattern that follows a doji, it is viewed as being a particularly bearish
combination.

Last Engulfing Patterns
A bearish engulfing pattern is a large black candle that envelops a small
white real body after an uptrend. However, if a bearish engulfing pattern
appears duing a priced ecline,i t has the potential of being a bullish bottom
reversal signal. This pattern is known as a laste ngulfingbottom( seeE xhibit
3.35(A)).T he last engulfing pattern is viewed as a turning point for the
bulls if prices can close above the black candle's close.
A bullish engulfing pattern is a two-candlestick Pattern inw}":rich,d ur-
ing a downtrend,a large white candle wraps around a prior small black
real body. However, if, during a rising market,a large white candle engulfs
the previous day's black candle, it is a potentially bearish pattern, re-
ferred to as a last engulfing top (Exhibit 3.35(8)). In candle theory, the
bearishnesso f this pattern is confirmed if the next day the market closes
under the prior white candle's close.
In Exhibit 3.35(8), the merged candle of the last engulfing top looks
bullish with its long upper shadow. However, remember that the last
engulfing top appears in an uptrend, so the merged candle line can be
compared to a potentially bearish hanging man line.

they convey the cautionary approach traders should take after the emer-
genceo f a last engulfing pattern.
In April 1992, in Exhibit 3.36, there was a bullish engulfing pattern
(note how, becauset his was a stock, I still viewed it as a bullish engulfing
pattern although the second session's open was the same as the prior
close).T he rally from that pattern stalled at the last engulfing top. Note
how both of these patterns just discussedh ad a white candle enveloping
a black real body. But what was the difference? In the regular bullish
engulfing pattern in April 1992,t he combination of the white enveloping
the black candles surfaced during a downtrend. In August 1992,t he same
combination of candles appeared after an uptrend, thus beco-i.g a last
engulfing pattern top. The fact that the next day's sessionc losed under
the long white real body's close was confirmation of the last engulfing

Prices then descended,f inding support at the bottom of the tall white
candle.T his support was testedi n late April with a black candlew rapping
around a white real body. This had the shape of a bearish engulfing

last engulfing bottom.
In Exhibit 3.38, at the September lows, there was a last engulfing
bottom. One of the more interesting aspects of this chart is that the
volume on the long black candle sessionw as unusually high. This could
be viewed as a selling climax. This increased the chance that the last
engulfing pattern was a bottom reversal.
Harami
The harami is comprised of a long real body and a small real body within
its range. The harami is the reverse of an engulfing line. Whereasi n an
engulfing pattern there is a long candle engulfing the previous real body,
a harami is an unusually long real body followed by a very small real
body.
After a downtrend, the emergenceo f a harami shows, as expressed
"the

vance/s hows that the market must have failed to maintain higher prices.
As shown in Exhibit 3.39(,4,)e, ither candle of the harami can be white
or black; all combinations are called harami. However, after a downtrend,
a white-black (meaning the first candle is white and the secondi s black)
or a white-white harami is viewed more bullishly than a black-white or
a black-black harami. This is because a long white candle is by itself
riewed as bullish, so its appearancei n a harami increasest he chancet hat
the falling power of the market will come to an end.
The samer ationale applies to a harami after an uptrend. As displayed
in Exhibit 3.39(8),a harami with a long black real body can be viewed as
more bearish than a harami in an uptrend that has a long white real
body. This is becausea long black real body after a rally is construed as
bearish, so when it is the first part of the harami pattern, the degree of
pessimismi s increased.
Other aspectst hat will increaset he importance of a harami include

as a high-priceh aramls ince the second session'sp rice is in the upper
end of the prior range. In a downtrend, if there is a harami with the
second small real body near the bottom end of the trading range of
the prior long real body, then the outlook is more likely for a market
lull rather than for a price reversal. I call this type of harami pattern
a lout-pice harami.
If the entire range, that is, the open, high, low, and close, are within
the prior real body, the chancesi ncreasef or a price reversal.
The smaller the shadows and the shorter the real body of the second
candle, the better the signal. If the second candle is a doji instead of
a small real body, it increasest he probability of a reversal. This com-
bination of a long candle followed by a doji in the first candle's real
body is called a harnmic ross.

Some fapanese literature refers to harami as transition periods in the
market. This means that if a harami in an uptrend is exceeded, it is
viewed as a bullish continuation signal. If the price closesu nder the low
of the harami sessioni n a downtrend, then expectm ore selling pressure.
Exhibit 3.40 illustrates how a rally that started with November's
bullish engulfing pattern hesitated at a harami in December. This harami
had two aspectst hat increasedi ts reliability: the second day's small real
body was almost in the middle of the first real body, and the entire range
of the second session( including the shadows) was within the real body
of the first session. It is interesting how the same scenario unfolded in
February. Again, a rally began from a bullish engulfing pattern, and then
again stalled with a classic harami. With the harami, as the japanese
"a
would say, crack has entered the market." A shooting star a few
sessionsa fter the February harami was also a bearish upthrust in which
the market made a new high, but the bulls failed to hold these highs.

If there was any doubt about the serious trouble this market was in,
the falling gap at the arrow should have been the final proof. Note how
the harami sessionsi n December and February became a ceiling. The low
in this market was made via a hammer in April. Later that month, a
violently long white real body was immediately followed by a diminutive
real body. This formed a harami that precipitated a decline until the
emergenceo f another hammer.
In the chart shown by Exhibit 3.41, the selloff from a bearish engulfing
pattern found a foundation with May's harami. This second candle of
the harami hovered near the bottom of the prior long black real body.
As a result, there was more likelihood that prices would move sideways
near the lower end of the tall black candle's real body. Note that the long

got near $80. The pattern marked X was not a harami becauset he white
real body was not unusually long. For a harami, the first real body has
to be very long relative to the precedingb odies.A nother harami appeared
in early August, but after an initial setback, prices exceededt he harami
so the trend resumed higher.
Exhibit 3.42 shows two exampleso f harami in which the open, high,
low, and closeo f the secondr eal body are within the first real body. The
October harami pattern was more important because of the extremely
short real body. Its small size made it like a doji session.T hus, October's
harami could be viewed as a harami cross.T he serieso f three long black
real bodies (labeled1 .,2, and 3) following October's harami underscored
the inherent weaknesso f the market.
In Exhibit 3.43, in February 1992,w e see how a support area (which
included a hammer) formed within a $19.00-$19.50a rea. Based on the
axiom that old support becomes resistance (the change of polarity prin-
ciple), we would expect$ 19.00-$19.50to becomer esistance.T hat is what

attack at the resistancei n late May occurred via a long upper shadow
candle (this candle was not a shooting star becausei t did not appear after
a rally).
As discussedb efore, the ideal harami pattern has the seconds ession's
real body in the middle part of the first candle. However, if during an
uptrend the second candle hovers near the top of the prior candle (i.e.,
a high-price harami), the chancesi ncrease for a consolidation rather than
a price reversal. In Exhibit 3.M, we see how several high-price harami
(marked 1 through 3) developed from early |une through late ]uly. After
each of these, the market consolidatedf or at least a week before moving
out of the trading range. This chart brings out another use of a high-price
harami (or a low-price harami in a downtrend)-option traders can con-
sider selling volatility. This is because after a high-price harami in an
uptrend or a low-price harami in a downtrend, a trader could expect that
the market posture may temporarily settle into a lateral band from a
previously strong trend. This could mean a decline in volatility.

THE WINDOW
The window, also known as disjointed candles,i s one of the more pow-
erful candlestickp atterns. As shown in Exhibit 3.45(A)a nd (B), a window
is the same as a gap in the West. That is, for a rising window, the top
of yesterday's upper shadow should be under the low of the today's
lower shadow. A falling window means that the low of yesterday's ses-
sion (i.e., the bottom of the lower shadow) is above the top of today's
upper shadow. Windows are a good visual clue because they clearly
display that the action and market sentiment is so one-sided.
In a talk I gave before a group of traders, I mentioned how, basedo n
my experiences,t he window was a candle tool that I have found to work
well. After I mentioned this, a trader in the audience told me that he
used to work at a Japaneseb ank. After my explanationo f the importance
of windows, he said that he then understood why the )apaneset raders
at the bank would routinely go to the charts looking for gaps-sometimes
even going back years to find one. This comment reinforced what I have
found to be true about the windows-it is a candle technique not to be
ignored.

EXHIBIT 3.45. Rising and Falling windows
Windows are continuation patterns in which the market resumest he
trend taken before the continuation pattern emerged.T hus, after a rising
window, which is a bullish continuation pattern, the prior uptrend should
continue. A falling window has bearish implications since it means the
prior trend, in that cased own, should resume.
"The
There is a saying used in Japan about windows, reaction will
go until the window." In other words, the window should be the limit
on a reaction. Thus, for a rising window, reactions( i.e., selloffs)s hould
stop within the window. For a falling window, rebounds (i.e., rallies)
should stop within the window.
when using windows as support and resistance,i t should be noted
that the price may fall below the bottom of a rising window or above the
top of a falling window temporarily before prices move back in the di-
rection of the window. This is illustrated in Exhibit 3.45(A) and (B).
A general rule that I have found useful based on my experiencei s
that if the price closest hrough the window, I then view the prior trend
as being voided. For example, if there is a rising window between g83
and $85 and then the market closes under the bottom of the window
(i.e., under $83), the uptrend can be considered as over. Conversely, if
there is a falling window between $62 and $60, once the bulls close the

market abovet he top of this window (at $62),t hen the bulls have broken
the back of the bear market.
Basedo n the discussiona bove, an intra-sessionm ove under a rising
window (or above a falling window) is not proof of a break. The conse-
quence of this is that you should wait for the market to close under the
bottom of a rising window (or above the top of a falling window) to
confirm that the uptrend is over (or that the downtrend has been voided).
On a weekly chart, you should wait for a weekly (that is, a Friday) close
under the bottom of the window to say that a window's support had
been broken. The risk in waiting for a close to confirm the break of a
window is that, by the time this happens, the market may be sharply
higher or lower than you may have wanted to risk.
In this section, I will discuss:
1. waiting for a closing price to confirm the break of a window's support
or resistancea rea;
2. how volume can influence the importance of a window;
3. using windows to confirm a trend reversal;
4. how windows can provide a quick clue to the market's health;
waiting for three sessionsf or confirmation of a window;

after the tall white candle. The fact that the pullback from this doji held
support at 50o/oo f the white body (seet he dashed line) showed the Power
of the bulls to support the market. Note how, as the market ascended,
the midpoint of the tall white candles became support.
Exhibit 3.48 illustrates how fune's dark cloud cover short-circuited the
prior rally. The sell-off from this pattern found a floor at April's window.
Other aspectso f this chart are interesting. The low of |une's price decline
was a harami. This harami appeared within the support band, as Pre-
dicted by the window. This same combination of a harami within the
window also emerged in Muy. Notice how the fune rebound from the
window stalled at the resistance area set uP by the dark cloud cover.
A shooting star is potentially bearish, but what if the shooting star
sessiona lso forms a rising window-which is bullish? In Exhibit 3.49, we
see that such a scenario unfolded as in mid-January. After the shooting
star line appeared, I was asked by a client whether this was a sell signal
(the client knew that a shooting star was normally a bearish signal). I
pointed out that while this was indeed a bearish shooting star, there was
another aspect that was perhaps even more important-the rising win-
dow. I suggested to this client that if he wanted to sell short, he should
wait for the market to close under the bottom of the window to confirm
that the uptrend was over. Since the bears could not pulI prices under

the client, who did not go short, ordered ten copies of my first book to
give to his friends!
Exhibit 3.49d emonstratesa critical concepts ometimesf orgotten, even
by practitioners of the candle charts. Namely, that an individual candle
pattern should be viewed in the context of the surrounding technical
picture. In this example, a shooting star viewed in isolation (that is, by
not looking at the window preceding it) could have caused a poorly
positioned trade.
when I show Exhibit 3.50 at my seminar, I title it, "saved by the
Light of the Candles!." This is becauset he chart is an example of how
candles can help avoid a bad trade. In mid-March, the market closed
above a major resistancel ine that went back to December1 991( only the
last part of this resistanceli ne is shown on the chart). This breakout action
could have been viewed as potentially bullish. However, there was still
a lack of confirmation based on the candles. Specifically, there was an
open window in early March that was yet unclosed. Based on candle
principles, until the market closesa bove the top of the window (in this
case at $1088),t he trend was still down. observe that, in spite of the
breakout from the resistancel ine, the bulls could not push ihe market
high enough to close above the top of the window. so although a resis-

tance line was pierced, those who knew about the candles were kept
from going prematurely long.
The window can be used as a potent confirmatory mechanism.I f there
is a reversal signal followed by a window in the same direction, trade rs
should be more confident of a price reversal. Exhibit 3.51 is an examrple
of this aspect. There was a bearish engulfing pattern in May. Prices de-
scended slightly, and then moved up to reach new highs in early I uly.
As this time, another bearish engulfing pattern appeared.H owever, ur-
like May's bearish engulfing pattern, July's was followed by a f alling

window. This window served to reinforce that a top had been in
place.
Exhibit 3.52 shows how candles can help give a quick underst;anding
of the market's health (or illness). In this case,t here was a stock rrhato ne
of my friends had bought. Some very bullish news came out, and im-
mediately after this news, the stock soaredt o a new high (seet hre6 so*;.
There were a few ominous signs that appeared in spite of this bullish

The other problem was more significant. As I explained to my friend,

agree with the precisenesso f the last part of that statement, but this
technique of waiting three sessions for confirmation may Plovide a
method to confirm a window's support or resistance.
In Exhibit 3.53, there was a falling window that opened in early March.
Basedo n the aboved iscussion,a method to trade with this window could
be to wait three sessionsa nd see if within that time the market can close
abovet he top of the window. If the bulls cannot push prices (on a close)
above the top of the window, candle theory states that this should in-
creaset he chancet hat the downtrend will continue. After all, the bulls
had three sessionst o move prices through the window and failed to do
so. In this example, we see how the falling window acted as resistance
as the bulls tried in the third sessiont o unsuccessfullyp ush prices above
the window. Attempts in May at this window's resistancel evel at 624
stalled via a dark cloud cover and then a long uPPer shadow candle (at

I would be careful about putting too much emphasiso n three sessions.
The Japanesep lace much importance on the number three in their cul-
ture, and this has spilled into their technicala nalysis.T hus, look closely
at what happens when you get a window in your market. you may find
that if the window is not filled in within two, four, or even five sessions,

more aggressive may be willing to, as the Japaneses ay, "take a leap of
faith" and they can go short without a bearish candle clue of a turn.
It is my opinion, based on experience, that even if there are three
windows in the same direction, I would not trade against the direction
of these windows until I see more proof of a trend reversal. To me, this
would require that the market moves through the last window on a close
(as shown in Exhibit 3.54). Basedo n this, bearish confirmation in Exhibit
3.55 came with the candle at x (in March), which closed under rising
window 3.
Exhibit 3.55 highlights how important it can be to wait for the top
window to be filled in before going short after three rising windows. This
gold chart shows a rising window in April that is labeled "window 2."
This is becausep rior to this date, and not shown here, there was another
rising window. This made April's window the second rising window.
Another window followed this, forming the third rising window. A few
sessionsa fter window 3, there was a dark cloud cover that was completed
on May 3. This pattern signaled a change in the trend as the market went
from vertical to sideways. However, although the trend did change, there
was not yet confirmation that prices would descend becauset he bears
had yet to close the market under the top window (window 3). This

window stayed open, and the market then continued on its upward
course. Interestingly, the same scenario as just discussedu nfolded as
another dark cloud cover (dark cloud cover 2) formed after window 4.
After dark cloud cover 2, prices again went from an uptrend into a lateral
band. But the widow (number 4) remained unfilled on a close as it was
successfullyd efended by the bulls via a hammer. Note how the window
was filled on an intra-day basis,b ut prices did not closeu nder the bottom
of window 4. This meant that the major uptrend was still in effect. Con-
sequently, I usually recommend our clients to use three or more rising
(or falling windows) at a time to offset or protect existing positions, but
not to go countertrend until the last window is filled in on a close.
Two Black Gapping Candles
\A/hile a falling window is bearish, it is even more portentous if the two
candlesi mmediately following the window have black real bodies. Such
a combination is called two blackg appingc andles( Exhibit 3.57). The dual
black candles reinforce the fact that the trend has turned from up to
"rout
down. This pattern is a sign, as the fapanesee xpressi t, of the of
the bulls."

the session after the doji. The reason for waiting is that if the session
after the doji is a long white candle that trades higher, it would turn out
to be bullish morning star pattern.
In my studies, I have seen reference to this gapping doji only in a
falling market, not to a gapping doii in a rising market. However, I see
no reason not to view such a pattern as being bullish since it has the

requisite rising window. In such a scenario,I would also prefer to wait
for a higher sessiono n the day following the doji. This is becauset he
doji could be a sign of a tired market and if a white candle followed this
doji it would show that the market would then be refreshed.
As discussedi n the section on doji, a doji after an uptrend or a tall
white candle could be potentially bearish. However, I would view the
fact that if a doji gaps higher, some of the potentially bearishi mplications
of the doji are negatedb ecauset he rising window shows the underlying
strength of the market.
As shown in Exhibit 3.61, the doji at session1 did not gap lower (that
is, the high of doji session 1 was above the low of the prior session).
Becauseo f this, doji 1 is not a classicg apping doji, although the market
came so closet o opening a falling window with doji l that I still viewed
it as a gapping doji. Interestingly, the next session( at doji 2) the market
did form a gapping doji. A sign of further weakness arose when the
hammer and bullish engulfing pattern at 3 failed to hold as support when
prices closed under the support area set up by the bullish engulfing
pattern. At 4 the market gave an important bearish signal via the falling
window.
The gapping doji is a rare pattern, but in Exhibit 3.62 there is a falling
candle line with a small real body. While not a doji session,i t could be

viewed as similar to a gapping doji in that the small real body is almost
a doji and it gapped under the prior lows. (Even if a trader did not view
this as a gapping doji, it could also be viewed as two black gapping
candles.) This chart has some interesting candle signals that illustrate
how IBM was basing out near $40. These include the long lower shadow
at candle L and a tall white real body at candle 2. A shooting star in late
August created problems on the rally from candle 2. The market broke
under the lows of the mid-September hammer, but it is interesting how
easily we can see the selling pressure evaporating during this sell off (at
X) by a series of gradually shrinking black real bodies. The long white
candle at Y showed that the bulls had taken control.

white candle (candle 1 in the Exhibit) is followed by a small real body
(candle2 ). The small real body of the secondc andle line can be black or
white and should not touch the real body of candle 1. The third candle
of this pattern is a black real body that does not usually touch real body
2, and then closes well into the white candle line that make up the first
candle of this pattern. If the second candle of the evening star is a doji
instead of a small real body, then the pattern is an etsenindgo ji star.
In the Introduction to this book, I referred to the book written in the
mid-1700se ntitled, TheF ountaino f Gold-TheThreeM onkeyR ecordo fM oney.
In that book, referencei s made to Yin and Yang markets. Yang is another
term for bullish (for example, a white candle is sometimesr eferred to as
a yang line). A Yin move is a downturn. For instance,a black candle line
can be called a yin line. The Fountaino f Gold has a section that reads,
"When
movement reaches an extreme, there is stillness. This stillness
gives rise to Yin." This is a verbal description of the evening star. To
wit!
"When
1. yang movement reachesa n extreme"-the appearanceo f the
long white candle of the evening star pattern
"There

body reflects a market at a transition phase in which the trend goes

It is important to wait for the third line to get the bearish confirmation
of this pattern. This is because,a fter the secondc andlel ine, all we known
about the market is that it went from an uptrend to period in which the
bulls and bears were in a stalematea s gauged by the small real body of
this second candle. It is only after the long black candle moves into the
first session'sw hite body that we get the proof that the bearsh ave taken
control of the market.
Exhibit 3.64 is an example of how an evening star confirmed a resis-
tance area set up by a bearish engulfing pattern. Becauset his bearish
engulfing pattern and evening star arose near the same area, both pat-
terns formed a potential double top near $45. In Western technicals, a
double top is confirmed by a move under the low between the two price
peaks that make up the double top. In this chart, this low was made in
February at $a012A. double top gives a measure derived on the range
from the highs to the low of the pattern. In this case,t here was about a
$5 range that is subtracted from the February low of $a01.T his gave a

Western charting methods (e.9., the double top).

rally. I use the highest point of the three candles,t hat form the evening
star-that is, the top of the highest upper shadows, as my resistance.I f
you can withstand the risk, I would recommend using a close (rather
than an intra-sessionm ove) above the evening star's high as a buy stop.
In this case,i t would require a weekly (that is, a Friday close)a bove the

As previously discussed, there should be more flexibility in using
candlesi n the stock market than in some of the other markets, such as

some flexibility may be allowed with stocks in regard to the relation of
the real bodies, it should be remembered that the more ideal the pattern,
the greater the likelihood of a top.
The evening star from late August illustrated in Exhibit 3.67 is differ-
ent from the more traditional evening star in that the third real body of
this one is a small black real body rather than a long black one. However,
I viewed this as an evening star variation with all the bearish implications
of the more traditional evening star for a few reasons, which I will now
address:
1. The third candle of this evening star, although not a tall black candle,
nonethelessr eflected the potency of the bears by the fact that they
were able to drag prices well into the white real body of this pattern.
2. This evening star variation verified a resistance area. In mid-August,
there was a group of bearish candle signals that included a shooting

black candle that gaps lower, it is called a collapsingd oji star. The three
candlest hat make up this pattern are the samet hree as those needed for
the evening doji star. The differencei s that the evening doji star has the
doji above the tall white real body, while the collapsing doji star has the
doji gapping under, instead of above, the first white candle. This pattern
"omen
is said to be an of a large decline."
While not an ideal version, candle lines A, B, and C in Exhibit 3.69
could be viewed as the collapsing doji star pattern. This chart shows the
three main conditions needed for the collapsing doji star pattern: 1) an
uptrend to reverse (at the white candle at A), 2) a doji sessiont hat gaps
under the prior session (at B), and 3) another black candle that moves
under the doji session( at C).
Candle lines D and E show a gapping doji pattern (discussedi n the
sectiono n windows). While similar in appearancet o the collapsing doji
star, the gapping doji is a bearish continuation pattern. This means that
it occurs during a downtrend, while the collapsing doji star is a top
reversalp attern that occurs after an uptrend.

The Patterns 117
The Morning Star
Exhibit 3.70 shows that the classic morning star has none of the three
real bodies that make up the pattern touching. We can see from the
blended candle in Exhibit 3.70 that the more that real body 3 pushes into
real body 1, the longer the blended candle's lowet shadow, and hence
the more bullish the pattern.
As shown in Exhibit 3.7'1,t,h e area in which August's piercing pattern
appeared became support again in October via a classic morning star.
Also, the middle candle of this morning star was a high-wave candle.
The three candles highlighted in Exhibit 3.72 at the August lows cre-
ated a morning star. When, as in this case,t he star portion of this pattern
is a doji, the pattern is referred to as a morning doji star. There is another
interesting aspect about this morning star. If there is a doji session that
has a gap before and after it, is called anabandonedbaby.Int his chart of
Penney, note how there was a gap between sessions 2 and 3 of the
morning star and almost a gap between the first two sessions.T hus, this

bottom is, in terms of a bar chart, an island bottom that is also a doji.
You can image how rare this combination is.
In the next chapter, I will focus on weighing the overall technical
picture in relation to an individual candle pattern. In Exhibit 3.73, I will
briefly addresst his issue. The hammer is September( at hammer L) was
a potentially bullish signal. However, this bullishness was mitigated by
the fact that on the day of the hammer, the market opened a falling
window. Note how this window then became a resistancea rea. A few
sessionsla ter, another hammer formed (shown at hammer 2). The session
after hammer 2 completed the third line needed for the morning star
pattern. So, although there were two hammers in this chart, the overall
technical picture for hammer 2 was more consecutive than it was for
hammer 1 because of hammer 2's longer lower shadow and because
hammer 2 was part of a morning star pattern. As a result, for those
looking to buy, the areat o have consideredw ould be after the completion

mid-october. The rising window in mid-october gave even more bullish
proof.
In Exhibit 3.74, there was a hint of a bottom near $12 based on the
lune L992b ullish engulfing pattern. In late ]uly, the support area of this
pattern (i.e., the lows of the bullish engulfing pattern it $fZ) was suc_
cessfullyd efended. However, in August, these ib-, *"r" breached,b ut
only temporarily as the bulls were able to regain control of the market
by pulling prices back up over g12a gain. In d&ng so, the market formed
a morning star pattern and a spring.
As shown in Exhibit 3.75, the first candle of a classicm orning star has
a large black real body. The third candle of the pattern is a tall white real
body that pushes well into the first candle of the pattern. In the morning
star pattern M1, the first candle had a small white real body instead of a

a small white real body instead of the more traditional long white real

DGIIBIT 3.75. Morning Star and Subjectivity, GM-Daily
The fact that both of these morning star variations appeared near the
same support area meant that while both M1 and M2 were not classic
morning star patterns, they should be viewed nonethelessa s bullish clues.
This chart underscores an important point-candles are a form of pattern
analysis, and as such, there is a subjectivity that goes with candlestick
analysis.
In this regard, I once wrote to the Nippon Technical Analysts Asso-
ciation to see how they viewed candle chart patterns that were less than
"We
ideal versionso f a pattern. This was their response: have found our
discussions very interesting in the sense that you try to be very specific
in determining definitions of japanese exhibit readings while we try to
keep them flexible so as not to exclude all possibilities. This . . . may be
traced to differences in the way of thinking of Westerners who prefer
being precise and definite and Orientals who like to be flexible."



==================================================
                     PAGE 129                     
==================================================

The Patterns L21
This highlights an important point in that the exhibits I have illus-
trated are mostly ideal versions of the patterns, but in the real world,
one should not exclude the possibility that a less than ideal version of
that pattern is valid. How do you determine if you should trade from a
less than ideal pattern? Basedo n the Japaneseli terature, may conversa-
tions with fapanesec andle traders, and my experience,h ere are a few
suggestions:
1. Wait for more confirmation of that pattern's prediction. For example,
an ideal dark cloud cover should have the seconds ession'sc losem ore
than halfway into the first candle's white real body. If the closei s less
than halfway into the white real body, then wait until the next session
to see if the market remains weak.
2. If the less than ideal pattern confirms a support or resistancea rea, or
if it appears in a very oversold or overbought market, the greater the
odds that the pattern will be a reversal. For example, if there is a
"ham-
hammer in which the lower shadow is not very long, but if this
mer-like" line confirmed a 50o/ore tracement area, I would view such
action as having all the bullish import as would a more traditional
hammer.
3. A method you may find useful in helping to determine the significance
of a less than ideal pattern is to make a blended candle from that
pattern. Then seei f the blended candlec onfirms the pattern's forecast.
For example, look at Exhibit 3.75 (GM) previously discussed.I used
this chart to draw the blended candles from morning star variations
M1 and M2. Notice how each of theseb lended candlesh ad long lower
shadows.T he long lower shadows of both of the blended candlesa nd
the fact that both M1 and M2 emerged near the same support with the
long white candle following M2 gave clues that the bears were losing
control of this market.

aspects hows one of the major advantages of the candle charts-they can
often send a reversal signal in only a few sessions,w hereas bar charts
can take much longer. Although some candle patterns do take longer to
unfold, they are nonetheless extremely valuable. One of these longer
:erm pattern techniques is the eight to ten records essions.
When a candle session makes a higher high, the japanese call it a

record sessionh igh. A lower low is called a record sessionl ow. In candle
theory, when there are eight to ten record sessions( that is, eight to ten
almost consecutive higher highs or lower), it increasest he possibility that
the preceding trend will change. Exhibit 3.76(A) shows ten record highs
and ten records lows.
Eight to ten record sessionsa re so important in ]apan that they have

this expressioni s that just as the bones, or skeleton, of a person's body

Sakataw as the port city in which Homma traded. In recognition of this,
there are many references throughout the ]apanese literature to candle
charts being called Sakatac harts.)
I will now discuss how to count record session highs, but the theory
will be the same for record session lows. First, confirm that a low price
for the move has occurred.T he top of Exhibit 3.76(A) displays how, after
a new low, the next sessionm ade a higher high. This sessionb ecame

was not created. Only when a new high was touched was it counted as
record session2 .
To count record sessionsi n a downturn, first confirm that a new high
has been set. The sessiont hat makes a lower low then becomesr ecord
session1 . The next lower low then becomesr ecord session2 .
The theory of record high sessions is that during a rally, a trader
should stop buying after eight to ten record sessionh ighs (or liquidate
longs, or sell short with the appearance of a bearish candle signal after
theser ecord sessionh ighs). The samep hilosophy, but in reverse,s hould
be considered after a decline with eight to ten record sessionl ows. To
wit, a trader should stop selling after about eight record sessionl ows (or
cover shorts, or buy looking for a bounce with a bullish candle signal
after eight or more record sessionl ows).
The record sessionc ount need not be consecutive.A few sessionso f
consolidation can be ignored when counting the new highs or lows.
Generally, there should not be more than two or three sessionso f side-
ways action between the record sessions,n or should there be a sharp
move counter to the record sessiont rend.
The reason that record sessionss hould be almost consecutiveh as to
do with the underlying concept of record sessions.I n the caseo f eight-
ten record sessionh ighs (lows), the market becomeso verbought (over-
sold). In an overbought (oversold) situation, the market becomes vul-
nerable to a price dip (rally) as those who are currently long (short) may
decide to take their profits.
The market can relieve an overbought or oversold situation in one of
two ways-by trading laterally or by experiencing a sharp price correc-
tion. If the market corrects the overbought or oversold situation by either
of these methods, the record sessionc ount is no longer valid since the
market is no longer overextended, and thus is less vulnerable to a cor-
rection. For example, in Exhibit 3.76(8), observe how the market got to
record sessionh igh 5, then quickly sold off for three sessions.B ecause
of the extent of the selloff during theset hree sessions,t he market relieved
its overbought condition. As shown, a new count is then started after
low 2.
Do not be too concernedw ith the specificn umber of record sessions.
The eight to ten record sessionr ule is a guidepost. Each market has its
own personality. |ust as those who follow cyclesm ay find that different
markets have different cycles, so some markets may correct after six or
trvelve record sessioni nstead of the more normal eight-ten sessions.
In Exhibit 3.77, ftom the low at X, we start the record sessionh igh
count at the next candle since it made a higher high. After record session
8, the market formed two doji. These doji reflected a market that is tiring.
For those who were looking for a reason to exit longs, these doji and the

the overall market condition before trading with the candles. Otherwise,

A member of the Nippon Technical Analysts Association wrote to me
that he views the overall technical picture as more important than an
individual candle pattern. I certainly agree with that sentiment. Effective
candle charting techniques require not only an understanding of the can-
dle patterns, but a policy of using sound, coherent trading strategiesa nd
tactics. It is unfortunate that some traders who know about the candle
patterns often ignore such tactics. The candles are a tool that must be
in.otpotuted with other trading guidelines. In this sense, I have always
viewed the candles as being another color, albeit an important one, on
my technical palette.

the importance of such strategic principles as using stops, determining
the risk and reward aspectso f a trade, observing where a candle pattern
is in relation to the overall trend, and monitoring the market's action
after a trade is placed. By understanding and using these trading prin-
ciples, you will be in a position to most fully enhancet he power of the
candles. By the end of this chapter, you should understand that what
emergesb efore and after a candle pattern is a critical element of trading.

The protective stop out level is that price. No matter how reliable the

is wrong. By using stops, you are defining the risk of a trade. ln effect,
the use of stops provides one of the most powerful aspects of technical
analysis;i t offers a risk managementa pproach to the market.
Many of the candlestickp atterns can become a support or resistance
area. For example, a dark cloud cover often acts as resistance.A s such,
for those who are short, a protective buy stop can be placed on a close
above the high of the dark cloud cover. In Exhibit 4.1.,w e see that an
uptrend that started in early January stopped via a dark cloud cover as
the market went from an uptrend preceding this pattern into a lateral
band after the dark cloud. The dark cloud cover acted as resistancef or
the next 7 sessions.B ut the rising window and then the close above the
high of the dark cloud cover were signs that the market was ready to
once again advance.
It is human nature that when price action turns againsty ou, wishful
thinking enters the picture. For instance, after the market pushed above
the stop out level in Exhibit 4.1 (the high of the dark cloud cover), some
traders who were short may have hoped that the market would then turn
around and decline.B ut in the market, there is no room for hope. Staying
in a market that moves through a stop out level in the hope that prices

of the rising window. Note how, in this market, the window was pierced
on an intra-weekly basis, but the bears did not have enough itaying
power to maintain prices under the bottom of the window by the close
of the week. In this case,t he window held as support, but noi all traders

in early 1993,t he bears finally managed to drag prices under the rising

RISK/REWARD

I often find that, after my seminars, people in the audience are so excited
"light"
about the new offered by the candles that they cannot wait to
get back to their offices or homes to place a trade based on a candle
pattern. However, as one of the books that I had translated stated (a
"wait

is virtuous, a patient mind or spirit is essential."2 ltt other words, just
"time

for a trade. I try to warn my audiencest hat one of the most important
"right
aspectsi n determining the moment" for a trade is to inspect the
risk/reward aspecto f the market at the time the candlep attern is formed.
In this context, a trader who was in an institutional trading group for

the risk and reward picture. The other component is the price target of

price targets, from Elliott Wave to previous support or resistancea reas.
Becausec andle charting techniquesu sually do not provide a price target,
I often recommend the joining of Western technicalsw ith candles. The

the Western tools, such as retracementso r trend lines, can help provide

As shown in Exhibit 4.4, there was a bearish engulfing pattern in
early september. Based on the concept that the high of the blarish en-
gulfing pattern should be resistance,a trader wanting to sell short could
place a protective_buys top above the high of this beirish engulfing pat-

is: "Does a short sale based on this bearish engulfing pattern offer an
attractiver isk/reward?." (Selling short is relatively rare in the stock mar-
ket. Nonetheless,t his chart can be used as a guidepost for other markets,
such as futures, where short selling is more common.) Looking at the
overall technical picture and considering the risk/reward aspect, such a
trade would not be warranted. This is becauseo f the rising window that
preceded the bearish engulfing pattern. A short sale from this bearish
engulfing pattern should mean a stop above the high of the bearish en-
gulfing pattern. With the support at the rising window, this is not an
attractive risk/reward trade since, in this case, the risk and reward are
about equal. A few weeks later, a dark cloud cover arose.N ow, with the
high of the dark cloud cover as a stop and the window as a target, this
becomesa more attractive trading opportunity from the short side.
Exhibit 4.5 underscorest he difficulty of trying to determine which of
the candlestick patterns is more important. In this chart, there was a

bearish engulfing pattern. Normally, that pattern is considered more
bearish than a dark cloud cover becauset he black candle of the engulfing
pattern envelops the entire prior white candle, rather than just part of
the white candle, as is the case with the dark cloud cover. But in this
example, selling short with the dark cloud cover offered a better trading
opportunity than selling short with the bearish engulfing pattern.
As shown in Exhibit 4.6, the appearanceo f a bullish candle signal
does not always warrant a new long position. In this chart, we see that
that a bullish morning star was formed by the price action on fanuary g,
9, and 10. The close on ]anuary 10 (the day the morning star was com-
pleted) was at $1205.L et us look at whether a buy at $1205i s an appealing
trade based on the risk/reward ratio. First, to determine the reward, we
seet hat there was a support area from late November near $1220.B ased
on the change of polarity principle (where old support becomes new
resistance), a trader who was looking at the market in early january
(when the bullish morning star was formed) might then expect a bounce
to resistance near $1220. So the target is near fi1220.T o determine the
risk in this trade, we would use the candle theory that the low of the
morning star pattern should be support. In this case,t he stop would be
on a close under the morning star pattern at $1169.

Consequently, the parameters of this trade are: buying at $L205( at
the completion of the morning star pattern), a stop at$1169,a nd a target
near $L220.T his means a $36r isk and a $15t arget. Not an attractiver iski
reward trade by any stretch of the imagination! The morale of the story:
do not place a trade just becausea candle pattern emerges. Note how
the bottom of the morning star became support a week later. The rally
from there stalled at the expected 91220r esistance area via a high-wave
candle at L and the long black real body at 2. These two candlesf ormed
a bearish engulfing pattern. Normally, a bearish engulfing pattern after
such a small preceding uptrend is not too important. But in this specific
case, it took an extra significance since it confirmed the $L220r esistance
area.
TREND
"It
is Easiert o Run Down a Hill Than Up One"
"as
There is a beautiful japanesep hrase, clouds to the wind and winds
to the blossom." In the context of trading, I would comParet he trend to
the wind and the price to the clouds or blossoms,w hose movements are
controlled by the wind. Thus, determining where the most curtent price
is in relation to the trend is of vital importance. This means that a candle
pattern should be viewed in the context of the prevailing trend before
deciding if a new position should be initiated.
The method I usually recommend for incorporating the candle pat-
tefns into the trend is to place a new trade in the direction of the pre-
vailing trend and to offset a position when there is a reversal signal
againstt he prevailing trend. For instance, bearish candle signals in bull
trends should be used to offsetl ongs (or to take other protectivem easures
such as selling calls or moving up sell stop levels). But a bullish candle
signal in a bull trend could be used to place a new long position. The
opposite would be true in markets with major downtrends. To wit, ini-
tiating a short sale on a bearish candle signal should be the main goal in
a bear market. A bullish signal in a bear market could be used to cover
shorts.
There are many ways to determine trend. (In Part 2 of this book, I
will reveal some popular methods of trend determination used by Japa-
nese traders and investors.) The goal of this section is not to help you
find the best way to determine trend, but to get you to think about some
ways to incorporate trend into your candle analysis. In this section, I will
discuss some of the more common Western methods of trend determi-
nation such as trendlines and moving averages.

For those who would like to learn more about the practical applica-
tions of some of the most popular western technical tools, inciuaing
those techniques to help determine trend, I highly recommend the book,
TechnicalT raders Guide to ComputerA nalysis of the Futures Market, by
CharlesL eBeaua nd David Lucas( Island view FinancialG roup, Torrance,
cA). Do not let the title of the book dissuade you if you do not use
computerst o trade. This book is a must for any trader who usesw estern
technicalt echniques.
One of the most basic methods of determining trend is to use a trend-
line. In Exhibit 4.7, we see how a resistancel ine from late June to early
August kept the trend bearish. The candlesg ave some early warnings of
a market that was bottoming. Specifically, the hammer in |uly, the m-orn-
ing star in early August, and a small rising window in late August (which
also completed an island bottom). yet, all these bullish signals were in
the context of a bear market (as defined by the downward iloping resis-
tance line). It was not until the break above the trendline that a new
bullish trend was confirmed. Note how the rally from this breakout stalled
at september's dark cloud cover. That dark cloud cover then becamea

pattern (the empty spacew as due to a holiday). But looking at the overall
technical picture, including the trendline, it is obvious that a short sale
based on the bearish engulfing pattern would not offer an attractive trade
based on risk/reward levels. This is becauset he target should be the
support defined by the trendline, and a stop should be above the high
of the bearish engulfing pattern. The uptrend was confirmed as broken
when the market closed under the trendline on |uly 19.
Using Exhibits 4.9(A) and (B), I show an examPle of how a bullish
candle signal could be used as a buying opportunity on a pullback in bull
trend. Exhibit 4.9(A) is a chart that shows a nicely defined uptrend sup-
port line (the more often a trendline is tested, the more important it
should be). Candle 1 is shown as it looked on the morning of September
15, 1993.S ince the sessionw as not yet over, candle l" is not yet formed
for the day (remember that a completed candle needs a closing price).
As shown in Exhibit 4.9(A), at the time the chart was drawn (the morning
of September1 5),t he market had just tested a long-term uptrend support
line. Shifting over to the intra-day 30-minute candle chart in Exhibit 4.9(B\,
note how a bullish engulfing pattern unfolded during the morning of
September 15. The dashed line in Exhibit 4.9(B) represents the same
trendline on the daily chart. We seeh ow a bullish candle signal appeared
during a selloff to an uptrend support line. This showed the concept that,

in a bull trend, we look for corrections on which to buy with a bullish
candle signal.
For those who use moving averaget o help define the trend, I illustrate
in Exhibit 4.10h ow to use candle signalst o trade within the trend. Based
on the fact that the market is under the moving average, the trend is
down. In such an environment, bearish candle signalsc an be used to sell
short and bullish candle signals should be used to cover shorts. For trad-
ers who are more risk oriented and may want to buy in a bear market,
use a short-term resistancea reaa s a target. In this example,a rally started
with a harami in June. However, as the market got to the S2-weekm oving
averager esistancea rea, the candles reflected increaseds elling pressure
as shown by the long upper shadow candle at L and the long black real
body candle at 2. For traders who bought at the harami, the resistance
area defined by the moving average should be an area to liquidate. For
those who were looking to go in the same direction as the overall trend
(in this case, sell on bounces), then the aforementionedb earish candle

signals could be used to sell short. The falling window showed that the
bears gave the market an extra pull lower. The long white candles in
mid-|uly was a hint of strength. The rally from these candless topped via
a doji that stalled at the moving average resistancea rea. This was an
extremely attractives hort sale since that doji areaw as not only at the 52-
week moving average,b ut it was also at the falling window's resistance
area. Note how after this sell-off the market bounced back after 9

BECOMING A MARKET CHAMETEON
"An
ArmyM anageitss v ictoryin Accordanwceith thes ituationo f the

when first placing a trade, you have expectationsa bout how the market
should act. However, the market is fluid, ever flowing, and ever chang-
ing. As a result, you must continually monitor the mirket,s path to see
if price action performs according to your expectations.I f noi, you will
have to take appropriate action. Adapting to changing market conditions
is what I call being a marketc hameleonB. eing a market chameleon, that
is, quickly and effectively adapting to a new market environment, is a
vital element to successfult rading. There is an appropriate quote that I
heard years ago. It comparest rading to fencing. Ii said thatln trading,
as in fencing, there are the quick and the dead. Being a market chameleon
means that you are quick enough to adapt to the market so as to',live"
to trade another day.
When a trader has a market opinion, there should be a price that tells
him or her that their market forecasti s wrong. I will look at this aspect
in Exhibit 4.11. In that chart, there was a dark cloud cover in the latter
part of october. At that point, I turned bearish on this market becausea
confluenceo f technical factors hinted that prices would not close above
$36. There were four reasonst o expect any rallies to stall in the $35.50-
$36.00a rea.T hesew ere:
1. The high of the dark cloud cover at $35.50s hould becomea resistance
area.
2. A small falling window provides resistancen ear g36.
3. The lows of the three sessionp rior to the falling window were near
$36. Based on the concept that old support becomesr esistance,t his
$36 support should be converted to resiitance.
4. A Fibonacci 620/or etracement of the decline from A to B was near
$35.s0.

In this case, if the bulls had enough force to close prices above the
top end of my $35.50-$36.00re sistance area,I would then have had to
changem y bearish stance.I n other words, I would have had to adapt to
new market conditions. We can see that although the bulls tried for a
few weeks after the dark cloud cover to push the market above the top
end of the $35.50-$36.00re sistancea rea, they failed.
Exhibit 4.12 displays a resistancea rea in late Decembern ear $20 that
was verffied by a hanging man and bearish engulfing pattern (the space
between these two candles was due to a holiday). The price slide that
began near this $20 area tried to stabilize in early January near the $\9
support areaf rom the month before. The long black real body of january
12b roke this $19s upport. Thus, up until that time, all the signalsc oming
from the market were negative. However, candle clues that the market
was changing its complexion came with the high-wave candle after the
long black real body. Another warning about having to adjust from a
bearish view to a more constructive view about the market came the
following week with the morning star pattern. Final proof of a turn-
around came with a rising window.

COMPUTERS AND CANDLES

Caution"
Many technicala nalystsb aset heir trading strategieso n computer testing.
with the widespread use of computers and the popularity of candles,
there may be traders who may want to use computers to find the most
important or reliable candle patterns. For those who may decide to do
such testing, I think it is important that other aspects,b esidesj ust having
the computer pick out the candle patterns, must be taken into account
with such testing. That is the focus of this section.
The Importance of Where a Candle Pattern Appears
As discussedp reviously, one should never view a candle signal without
seeing the pattern in the context of what happened before the pattern
appeared.T his aspect is related to a question frequently asked of me-
which are the most important candle patterns?I n answering this, I first



==================================================
                     PAGE 152                     
==================================================

Candlesa nd the OaeraIIT echnicaPl icture L45
suggestt hinking about what the pattern is relaying about the market's
action. For example, in comparing a dark cloud cover with a bearish
engulfing pattern, I would normally consider the bearish engulfing pat-
tern as more important. This is based on the fact that the seconds ession
of the bearish engulfing pattern has a close under the prior white real
body. The dark cloud cover's seconds ession,h owever, has a closew ithin
the prior white real body. As such, the bearish engulfing pattern shows
that the bears had more control of the market as compared to the dark
cloud cover (seeE xhibit 4.13).
But candle patterns can never be viewed in isolation. A trader always
has to consider the surrounding technical picture. For example, a dark
cloud cover that arisesa t a major resistancea rea should be construed as
being more likely a reversal than would a bearish engulfing pattern that
is not at resistance.A n instance of the danger of looking at a pattern in
isolation is shown in Exhibit 4.5 on page 135 where, becauseo f risk/
reward considerations, a dark cloud cover offered a more attractive trade
than did a bearish engulfing pattern. Thus, looking at a candle pattern
in isolation can be a dangerous procedure. As was nicely expressedt o
"where
me by a Japaneset rader, you stand is more important than an
individual pattern." As a result, if you decide to test out the reliability
of the candlep atterns, remember not to just use a buy or sell signal based
solely on the candle pattern. You must first factor into your analysisj ust
where the pattern emerged.
The Question of Determining Specific Criteria for the Pattern
The candle patterns are based on sound psychologicalr easoning. (Think
about what happens with a dark cloud cover. After a strong white ses-
sion, the market opens higher and then closes well under the white
session'sc lose. Doesn't that clearly illustrate how the bears have man-
aged to wrest control from the bulls?) But candles, unlike mathematically

concrete numbers, such as moving averages or oscillators, may not be
easily adaptable to computer testing. A moving averagee ither is, or isn,t,
above yesterday's close. This is a yes-no choice for the computer. But
candle signals are not this clear-cut, and subiectivity is required in de-
termining what is or is not a candle pattern.
A classic dark cloud cover should have the close of the black candle
sessionm ore than halfway into the prior white's real body. That is a rule
that can be quantified. But what if there were a less than ideal dark cloud
cover in which the close of the black candlestick session did not get more
than halfway into the prior white session's real body? That, based on the
standard definition of a dark cloud cover, would not be a dark cloud
cover pattern and the computer might not pick up such a pattern. The
question then becomes: What happens when a less than ideal dark cloud
cover shows up near a resistance area? Does a computer read that as a
dark cloud cover or does it ignore the pattern? In such a scenario, I would
say that the less than ideal dark cloud cover should be viewed as being
iust as bearish as a more traditional dark cloud cover. This is the scenario
that unfolded in Exhibit 4.14. Note the annotation that has a question

mark after the term cloud cover." This was not an ideal dark cloud
cover becauset he close did not move under the center of the prior white
candle. However, although this was not an ideal dark cloud cover, I still
viewed it as a dark cloud cover for a few reasons.F irst was the extremely
long upper shadow of the black candle of the pattern. This showed how
quickly prices retreatedf rom the new highs. In addition, by the close of
this black candle, the market was technically damagedb ecauset he bears
were able to drag pricesb ack under a prior high (marked H on the chart).
This formed a bearish upthrust. Finally, the lower close after the dark
cloud cover helped confirm the market's inherent weakness.
Thus, even the most basics tep of having the computer find the candle
pattern may causep roblems. So, for those using a computer to pick out
the candle patterns, remember that the candle patterns should be used
as guideposts.W hile the ideal patterns may be relatively easyt o quantify,
the less than ideal patterns are often useful trading signals that should
also be accountedf or. In this context, there is a large degree of subjec-
tivity required. This is no different from standard bar chart pattern rec-
ognition.
Placing the Trade
If a candle pattern emerges, does that mean that a buy or sell signal is
automatically given? of course not. As I previously discussed,y ou should
not basea trade on a candlep attern in isolation. You must firsi determine
the overall technical picture at the time the pattern forms.
As an example of this aspect,l et us consider a shooting star. A com-
puter Program that basesa sell signal on the shooting star alone would
have given an improper sell signal if that shooting star also formed a
rising window (this scenariou nfolded in Exhibit 3.49 on page 9g). Thus,
having a computer signal a trade just becausea candlu putt".r, emerges,
and ignoring the overall technicalp icture (i.e., the malor trend, the p-rice
action preceding the candle pattern, etc.), courd be a mistake.
Another aspect is the concept of risk/reward discussede arly in this
chapter. |ust becausea pattern appears does not mean that one should
placea trade on the candle signal. For example,w hat if there is a morning
star in gold, but the risk for the trade is $15 and your objective is also
515?w ould a long position on that pattern be warranted? In this case,
*re answer is no. \zvhethera trade is warranted or not is dependent on
the risk/reward parameterso f the market at the time the pattern is formed.
As an exampleo f this, in Exhibit .l.s,lshow two hammers.H ammers
arep otentially bullish signals,b ut the risk/reward aspecto f eacho f these

hammers would not justify a long trade. In both cases,t here would have
been a 15-20 point risk (basedo n a stop under the hammer's lows) for
a possible 20-25p oint target (basedo n the resistancea rea near 425).T hus,
an automatic buy based on a computer trading program would have
worked in this example because the market rallied from both hammers.
Nonetheless, these buy signals would not have been a trade based on
sound money management principles since the risk would have been too
large for the potential reward.
When to Offset a Trade
Placing a stop may be relatively easy with a computer (some testing is
even done without stops-a very dangerous procedure and one that de-
feats the concept of a risk management approach to trading), but how is
an objective picked? One time, a trader's objective may be last week's
lows, but maybe on the next trade, the objective will be a support line,
or maybe a 50o/or etracement. Every trader has his or her own style, so
be sure to take this into account when merging candles and computers.

pattern. After the bullish engulfing pattern, an up leg could be expected.
However, the price target of such a rally would be based on other tech-
nical tools besidesc andles since candles do not usually give targets.
Based on the concept that old support becomesr esistance,a trader
might have been looking for a move to the ]uly-August support area near
$1.85.F or that trader, this trade would not have been successful.H ow-
ever, another trader who uses Fibonacci retracements may have been
more successful since the market made a Fibonacci 38olob ounce of the
entire move from the September highs to the September lows. Since the
first trader's $1.85 target was not met, he would say that the bullish
candle signal was not reliable. Yet, for the second trader, whose target
(the 38o/ob ounce) was reached, the bullish candle signal was successful.
Thus, each trader's style must be taken into account when looking at
testing the candles' reliability.
How you trade with candlesticks will depend on your trading philos-
ophy, your risk adversity, and temperament. These are very individual
aspects.I f you decide to test the candle patterns or use computers to
help you trade with candles, it should be based on trading criteria and
rules chosenb y you. only by applying the candlest o your markets, with
vour own trading style, can you discover whether the candles will give
vou that extra edge.

INTRODUCTION
a a a . .
A ;up"t ese book on technical analysis insightfully stated that, "The
market is a fug of war where the strategy is to overrun the enemy ter-
ritory. In a tug of war, once the balance of power is lost, one side is
pulled and the result is decided. The market often acts this way, and one
should pay attention to the balance of powers."r The new (at ieast in the
West) techniques addressed in Part 2 of this book will help you determine
"balance
whether it is the bulls or bears who have the of power.,,
A widely used Japanese tool is the disparity index. It is similar to
Western dual moving averages,b ut this technique allows for better mar-
ket timing than do the traditional Western moving average techniques.
The disparity index is addressed in Chapter 5.
The charts detailed in Chapters 6,7, and 8 are called three-line break
charts, renko charts, and kagi charts. of the three, the kagi is probably
the most popular, followed by the three-line break and then the renko
chart. These charts are most closely comparable to the Western point and
figure charts. However, it is not necessaryt o understand point and figure
charts to understand any of these Japanesec harts.
fust as candle charts predate bar charts, the threeline break, renko,
and kagi charts predate point and figure charts. These charts are based
on generations of use in the Far East. A member of the Nippon Technical
Analysts Association told me that he had seen a kagi chart of the rice
market dated 1876.H owever, my research shows that unlike candlestick

154 The Dispaity Index and New Pice Charts
charting, which has a rich history, there is very little historical reference
material for the three-line, renko, and kagi charting techniques. This is
probably becausec andles are more colorful, offer more flexibility and are
more widely used. In contrast, the three-line, renko, and kagi charts are
more rigid, offering less room for subjective interpretation, and their use
has mostly been limited to the management level of ]apanesef inancial
firms.
As bar charts differ from point and figure charts, the three-line break,
renko, and kagi charts differ from candle charts. With candle charts, a
new candle line is added to the chart at every session,w hether the price
of that session makes a new high, a new low, or is unchanged. With the
charting techniquest o be addressedi n the rest of this book, prices must
go to a new high or low before a line on the chart can be added. Since
"The
the market has to go to a new high or low, I have entitled Paft 2
Disparity Index and New Price Charts."
Another difference between candle charts and the three-line break,
renko, and kagi charts is that these new techniques ignore time and are
dependent only on price changes. Since the market is not controlled by
time, but by price movement in these charts, the traditional ]apanese
methodology of drawing them does not include time on the horizontal
axis. However, in the charts in this second half of the book, I have in-
cluded a rough measure of time on the horizontal axis to help provide
referencep oints for my discussions.
The three-line break, renko, and kagi charts share similarities with
one another, but there are discrete and interesting differences between
each of these charting methods. Each chart and its related techniques
will be described in detail later, in their respective chapters. For some of
these new techniques, a trader will need to choosea pre-specified reversal
amount in order to draw a reversal line. In others, it is the market action
that will provide the signal to draw a new line. While the three-line break,
renko, and kagi charts may be different from one another, they are all
powerful weapons that should be part of a trader's technical arsenal.
Some of the advantageso f these new charts include:
L. Making support, resistance,a nd congestiona reasm ore evident
2. Capturing the significant moves by filtering out irregular price fluc-
tuations
3. Making the market's overall trend more apparent
4. Providing a broader view of the market by compressing the price ac-
tion and offering a longer term perspective
5. Helping to determine the time to offset positions: Becauset he candles
do not, as a general rule, provide a price target, the reversal signals
sent out by these new techniques can be used to exit a market position

6. Providing a means of technical analysis for markets that supply only
closes.T his is becauset heset echniquesr equire only the closingp rices.
Thus, mutual funds and yields on financial instruments such as T-
bonds can be analyzed using a three-line break, renko, or kagi chart.
Becauset hree-line break, renko and kagi charts are slower to react
than candle charts, they are frequently used by longer term investors.
However, traders with shorter time frame orientations will find that these
charting tools provide a practical and powerful method to determine
trend direction. Once the trend is determined, candle signalsc an be used
to trade in the direction of the prevailing trend.
As will be explained in the upcoming chapters, the sensitivity to the
three-line break, renko, or kagi charts can be adjusted by changing re-
versal criteria. With each of these charts, I will show you how to adjust
the chart's sensitivity. Short-term traders may want to make the charts
more sensitive to the underlying price action. Those who are more con-
cerned about a broader market perspective may want to use a chart with
larger reversal amounts so as to get more information on a chart. This
should help to obtain a historical perspective. This brings out another
important advantage of these new charts; by changing the reversal cri-
teria for these charts, a trader can adjust the sensitivity of the charts to
his or her trading needs.
Generally, the more sensitive the chart, the greater the number of
trading signals and the greater is the possibility of whipsaws, but the
sooneri t may get you into a new trend. A disadvantageo f large reversal
amounts is that by the time the trend reversal is made the market will
be more distant from the top or bottom.
Choosing a reversal is subjectivea nd dependent upon many aspects,
including the market's volatility, the price of the underlying commodity
or stock, a trader's trading style, and his or her time frame orientation
and risk tolerance. Consequently, I will not attempt to find the optimum
reversal amount, but I will let you know some of the more popular re-
versal criteria used by fapaneset raders.
These new price charts are usually less flexible than are candle charts.
This is because, with candle charts, there are more graduations of a re-
versal signal. For example, a small real body after an uptrend could be
viewed as a slowing of upside momentum, but not necessarilya s a price
reversal. For the new techniques in Part 2, prices either do or do not
provide reversal signals.
An important principle about trading with these new charts is that
they are usually based on closing prices, so a reversal signal is not con-
firmed until the close. By that time, the reversal amount may well be
exceeded.F or example, if the reversal amount is $2, the market would

==================================================

155 The Dispaity lndex and New Pice Charts
have to close either higher or lower by $2, but by the time the market
closes,i t could be $4 higher or lower. As a result, a trader could lose $2
of a potential move. Some Japaneset raders circumvent this problem by
initiating a light position if the reversal amount is met or exceededo n an
intra-sessionb asis. If the market then closesb y the reversal amount, they
can either add more at the close or wait for a correction to add more. If
the market fails to confirm the reversal by the close, the traders would
offset the light position they had earlier added.
Most commonly the closing price of the day or week is used to con-
struct the three-line break, renko, or kagi charts. Because of this, the
focus of Chapters 6 through 8 will be on daily and weekly charts. How-
ever, some traders in japan use intra-day kagi charts (three-line break or
renko charts are not normally used on an intra-day basis-perhaps these
charts have been less successfult han intra-day kagi charts). Thus, for
traders who have the time and the data, kagi charts can be constructed
on an intra-day basis using tick-by-tick data.
Chapter 6 will discuss the three-line break chart, Chapter 7 the renko
chart, and Chapter 8 the kagi chart. Each chapter witl be segmented the
same way. Each of these three chapters will begin with an Oaensiewto
give a flavor of the technique. Do not worry that if, after the overview,
you do not have a grasp of the technique. That will come with each
chapter's next section-Construction. This is where I provide a step-by-
step written and visual guide to building the chart.
After completing the section on constructing the chart, you should
have a full understanding of the underlying technique. The Trading Tech-
niquess ection, at the conclusion of each chapter, will then show you the
more popular trading techniques for that charting method. At the ends
of Chapters 6, 7, and 8, I have supplied the data necessaryf or you to
draw practice threeJine break, renko, and kagi charts. The answer charts
are provided on the pages following each of these sessions.
There are many ways to trade with these new charts. IA/hile I will
focus on some of the more popular trading techniques used in fapan,
these are by no means all of them. With almost every |apanese trader to
whom I spoke, or every article or book that I had translated,I camea way
with a new trading technique. This tells me that the three-line break,
renko, and kagi charts are limited only by your trading imagination.
Consequently,m y goal in Part 2 is to help you build a solid foundation
upon which the scaffolding of your own ideas can be built.

r
ln ]apan, as in the West, moving averagesa re used as a valuable trading
tool. Some of ]apan's moving averages techniques include golden and
dead crosses, the disparity index, and the moving average divergence.
Basedo n my work and discussions with Japaneset raders, it appears that
the most popular moving averages are the 5-, 9-, or 25-day averagesf or
shorter term traders, and for longer term traders, the 73-,26-week or the
75- and 2@-day moving averages. However, just as in the West, many
japanese traders have their favorite moving averages.
THE GOLDEN AND DEAD CROSS
The ]apanese use dual moving averages in which they compare short-
and long-term averages. For example, they will compare the 13- week
and 26-weekm oving averages.A s shown in Exhibit 5.L, rt a shorter term
moving averagec rosseso ver the longer term moving average,i t is viewed
as a bullish sign. The ]apanese call such a crossover a goldenc rossA. dead
crossis a bearish indication that occurs when a short-term moving average
crossesu nder the longer term moving average.
In Exhibit 5.2, the 26-week moving average is shown as a solid line,
and the 13-week moving averagea s a dashed line. When the shorter term
moving average moved under the longer term average in |uly 1992 it

THE DISPARITY INDEX
The disparity index (or disparity ratio), compares, as a percentage,t he
latest closet o a chosenm oving average.F or example, when the L3-week
disparity index is -25o/o, i t means that the market, basedo n the close,i s
25olou nder the 13-week moving average. A 200-day disparity index of
*I2o/o means that the current close is 12o/oa bove the 200-day moving
average.

market was an unusual 3Lolob elow its L3-weekm oving average." These
are references to the disparity index in which the current price is com-
pared to, in both of these cases,t he L3-weekm oving average.
Exhibit 5.3 shows an example using a 9-day disparity index. Looking
at that exhibit:
Area 1. When the disparity index is at 0 (shown at L), it means that
today's price is the same as the chosen moving average( in this
case,t he 9-day moving average).
Area 2. When the disparity line is under 0, it means that today's price
is a percentageu nder the chosen moving average.A t period 2,
for instance, the current close is t2o/ob elow the 9-day moving
average.
Area 3. When the disparity line is above 0, it means that today's price
is a certain percentagea bove the chosen moving average. For
instance,a t point 3 in Exhibit 5.3, today's price is 15oloa bovet he
9-day moving average.

a harami cross at a high-price level is a signal that the market is close to
"If
a top."r Another example: the koma (this is the Japaneset erm for a
spinning top or a small real body candle) appears after some indication
that the market is^a t a low price, then to an extent, one can buy some
and feel at ease."2
Of course, the question arises as to what constitutes a high- or low-
price area. Some traders have their own methodology to determine
whether the market is at a high or low price. They may, for example,
consider it at a low area if the market is near a major support area, or if
it is at a 50o/or etracement area. other traders may gauge high or low
levels on the relative strength index or stochastics,o r on an Etliott wave
count.
A method used by some Japaneset o determine whether the market
is at a high- or low-price is by using the disparity index. This is because
the disparity index is an effective mechanism to show if the market is
oversold or overbought. Remember that an oversold environment un-
folds when prices descendt oo quickly. In theory, the more oversold the
market, the more vulnerable it becomes to a bounce. An overbought
market is when prices ascend too far too fast, thus making the market
susceptible to a correction. In this regard, a high disparity index reading
can show that the market is overbought and a low disparity index could
reflect an oversold market.
Exhibit 5.4 typifies how the disparity index can offer value-added
analysist o a candlec hart. Note than an oversold or overbought indication
based on the disparity index will depend on the individual market and
the chosen disparity index. For this stock, when the 13-week disparity
index reached the * 10o/oa rea, the market became overbought. At a dis-
parity index near -LOo/o, t he market becomes oversold. By using this
extra information imparted by the disparity ratio in Exhibit 5.4, we can
get more confirmation of candle signals. Specifically:
L. As touched uPon in Chapter 2, a doji becomesa more viable signal
if it appears in an dversold or overbought market environment. In
this case, the doji at 1 emerged at a time when the market was
oversold (as gauged by the disparity index). This hinted that Delta
was ripe for a bounce or sideways action to easet he market's over-
sold condition. The long white candle after the doji helped confirm
the bullish implications.
2. At time period 2, the market showed signs of overheating, as re-
flected by the high disparity index. During the samep eriod, a series

of long upper shadow candles demonstrated that the bears were
aggressively dragging down prices from the $75 area.
3. The candle at session3 , with its long uPPer and lower shadow, was
a high-wave candle. This candle was also the second session of a
harami pattern. Both of these were signs that the market was losing
its prior downward and directional bias. These candle patterns co-
incided with a low disparity index. This combination of candle signals
and the oversold disparity index reading implied that either a bounce
or sideways activity could be expected. An oversold condition can be
relieved in one of two ways: either by a sharp bounce or by sideways
action (the ]apanese call sideways price activity boxa ctions ince prices
look like they are locked in a box). After this harami, the market
"box
traded laterally for two months. By this action," the disparity
index moved off its low reading. This showed that the market was
no longer oversold. As a result of not being oversold, the market

once again became vulnerable to another move lower. (Note the
hanging man before the renewed price decline.)
4. Another doji appeared at the same time as the 13-week disparity
index was near -10o/o. T his should tell a trader that the market was
in an oversold environment that should be closely monitored-es-
pecially becauseo f the doji. The tall white candle on the sessiona fter
the doji completed a morning doji star pattern.
5. The disparity index moving towards an overbought condition and a
dark cloud cover warned that the upside drive was losing force.
6. This is a good example of how the disparity index can help avoid
buying in a market that is vulnerable to a correction. A tall white
candle at 6 implied a stronger market lay ahead. However, a *!0o/o
disparity index reading at that time showed that pricesh ad ascended
too far too fast (i.e., became overbought). The disparity index thus
provided a warning sign not to buy the market. It turns out that
candle 6 completed a last engulfing top pattern (in which a white
candle envelops a black candle in an uptrend) that was confirmed by
the next session'sw eaker close.
7.,8. These black real bodies, especiallyt he long black body at 8, nor-
mally imply continued weakness.B ut the oversold nature of the mar-
ket, as measured by the disparity index, hinted that further down
moves were unlikely. Also, the white candle after the black candle
at 7 had a long lower shadow. This also offset someo f the bearishness
of the black candle.
9. A classicc ombination of an overheatedm arket (basedo n the elevated
disparity index) and a bearish candle pattern (the bearish engulfing
pattern). The fact that this bearish engulfing pattern appeareda t the
resistancea reaf rom October 1992( at 6) further reinforcedt he outlook
that Delta was at an important technicalj uncture.
10. Here we see how an oversold market joined with a bullish candle
signal (the hammer at 10) strongly hinted of higher prices to come.
In this chart, the L3-week disparity index gave extreme readings in
the *10o/oa rea. However, the markets you follow will probably have
different disparity zones that act as an overbought or oversold reading,
so it pays to experiment.
As discussed above, the disparity index is a useful tool to weigh
whether the market is overbought or oversold. As shown in Exhibit 5.5,
the *15oloa nd -15olo readings on the 13-period disparity index reflect
times when this market becomeso verbought and oversold. overbought

readings occurred at time frames A, C, and E, while oversold indications
arrived at time frames B, D, and F. However, in between these over-
bought and oversold levels, the disparity index could be used as a tool
of trend determination. In this context, while the disparity index is ex-
panding, it conveys a bull trend. If the disparity index declines, it echoes
a bear trend. In Exhibit.5.5, note that between the overbought reading
at A and the oversold reading at B, the index was in a downtrend. This
confirmed that the price trend was also down. This bearish confirmation
with a falling disparity index came from C to D and from E to F. Bull
trends were corroborated via an ascending disparity index from B to C
and from D to E.
Exhibit 5.6 shows another use for the disparity index, that of a tool
to monitor divergence. Note the downward sloping dashed line on the
disparity index connecting the peaks at A and B. At the same time the
disparity index was at B, prices had made a new high for the move-yet

the disparity index at B was lower than it was at A. This createda bearish
negative divergence in which prices reached a new high and the disparity
index did not.
THE DIVERGENCE INDEX
The Japanesea lso have a moving average oscillator called the diaergence
index. The name is derived from the fact that this technique measures
how far the price diverges from the chosen moving average.T he diver-
gence is calculated by taking the current price and dividing it by the
chosenm oving average.T hus, a 13-dayd ivergence of.102o/woo uld mean
that the close today is 102o/oo f the 13-day moving average.A 200-day
divergenceo f 97o/ow ould mean that today's price is 97o/oo f the 200-day
moving average.
The divergence is the same as the disparity index; it is just scaled

market is 2o/oa bove the 1,3-daym oving average. A 13-day disparity read-
ing of *2olo also means that the market is 2o/oa bove the 13-day moving
average.I n other words, a divergence of 102olois the same as the disparity
index being *2o/o.A divergence of 93oloh as the same implications as a
-7o/o disparity index.
Exhibit 5.7 shows the disparity index and the divergence indicator on

it is just the way the vertical scale reads that is different. Thus, all the
techniquesu sed for the disparity index would be the samea s those used
for the divergencei ndex.
Just as many computer system traders experiment with moving av-
erages,s o you may want to consider experimenting with divergence.A s
an example of this, I have the following study done in the 1980sb y the
Japaneseto statisticallyt est the Nikkei with its divergence.3

This study shows that, for example, using the 200-day divergence,
when the Nikkei is rising, there is a 95oloc hance that the divergence will
be between 102o/aon d 110oloT. his would mean that if the 200-davd iver-
Sencem oves above 1I0o/oi,t is considered excessivea nd there is increased
likelihood that the market is vulnerable to a correction. This concept could
be used as a time to move out of long positions in the belief that the
market is reaching the high end of its current bull leg.
In this discussion,r emember that high divergenced oes not necessar-
ily mean that prices will reverse. It is just that the market may be in the
throes of speculativef ever or panic selling (in the caseo f low value di

THREE-LINE BREAK CHARTS

"more
A;upun"se trader describedt he three-lineb reak chart as a subtle
form of point and figure charts where reversalsa re decidedb y the market
and not by arbitrary rules. That meansw e can gear it to the strength and
dynamism of the market."1
As shown in Exhibit 6.1,,t he three-line break chart looks like a series
of white and black blocks of varying heights. A new block is in a separate
column. Each of these blocks is called a line. Using the closing price, a
new white line is added if the previous high is exceededa nd a new black
line is drawn if the market reachesa new low for the move. If there is
neither a new high nor a low, nothing is drawn.
If a rally (sell-off) is powerful enough to form three consecutivew hite
lines (three black lines), then the low of the last three white lines (the
high of the last three black lines) has to be exceededb efore the opposite
color line is drawn (this procedure is explained in detail later in this
"three-line
section).T he term break" comesf rom the fact that the market
"break"
has to above (or below) the prior three lines before a new op-
posite color line is drawn. Here again, as discussedi n my first book, we
"three"
seet he importance of the number in Japaneset echnicals.
A major advantage of the three-line break chart is that there is no
arbitrary fixed reversala mount. It is the market's action that will give the
indication of a reversal.
Other names for the threeline break chart include:
1.. three-stepn ew price;

no new line is drawn.

the first line is 135-132,t he market

Drawing the third line: Compare today's price to the highest high and
the lowest low of the prior two lines.
The concept here is the same as that of determining when to draw
the second line. Only when the price moves to a new high or a new low
for the move is a white or black line drawn. In our example, the market
would have to go under 128 for a black line or above 135 for a white line.

OUR EXAMPLE: In session 4, the
price was 133. Since this was
within the price range of the prior
two lines (128-135),t here is no new (Priorh igh) 135
line drawn. The next time a line is
132
drawn is session 9, when prices
moved to a new high to L39.S ince
this was above the prior high (at
1.35),w e shift a column to the right
and a new white line is drawn from
the top of the prior line up to 139.
The new range of lines is now from
J
a low of 128 to a high of 139.
The next price outside of this 128-

L39 range is at price 11 at 145. At 139
that time, a white line is drawn
from the prior 139 high to the new
high at 145.W e now have two con-
secutive white lines. The new
range is 128-145.

At session1 2, with the price at L58,
a new high is made. So, on the next
column we draw a white line from
145t o 158.W e now have three suc-
cessive white lines. As shown in
the following discussion, this is an
important occurrence.
Drawing a line after three consecutive white or black lines: If there are

Remember that this technique is called the three-Iineb reak.I ts name is

For the rest of this discussion,s ee Table 6.L and Exhibit 5.1.
By session 12 there are three consecutive white lines. As a result, the
market has to move under the low of the thfud white line (at 132)t o draw
a black turnaround line. However, white lines continue to be drawn as
long as a new high is made (that is, if prices move above L58). Thus, in
our example, before a new line can be built, the market must either move
under 132 (for a black line) or above 158 (for a white line).
The next price that exceeded our 132-158 range was price 17 at 160,
a new high. Thus, a new white line is drawn from 158 to 1"50N. ow, the
bottom of the last three white lines is 139. Thus, the new price range to
monitor is below 139 to get a black line and above 150 to draw a white
line.
Price L8 is a new high, as is price 19. So, two new white lines are
added. When we get to price 19 at 167, the low of the third white line is
then 158.T hus, our price range is either under 158f or a black turnaround
line or above 167 for a new white line.
Price 20 is 156. This is under the lowest low of the preceding three
white lines (at 158), so we draw a black turnaround line from the bottom
of the top white line down to the new low price at 156. Becauset here

are not three white consecutive white lines (since the black line ap-
peared), a new white line is added if a new high or low for the move is
made.
The new range to exceed is the prior high at 167 and the recent low
at 156. Price 22 makes a new high at 168. As a result, we add another
white line. This white line starts at the top of the prior black line and
goes up to the new high at 168. New highs are made (and new white
lines are added for each higher session)u p until session2 7 at a price of
180.
At price 29 at 170,t he market moved under the low of the third prior
white line (at !71), so a black turnaround line is drawn from the bottom
of the top white line down to 170. our new range is 170-180.T he next
time prices move outside this range is at session3 5, when the market
moved down to 168. At session 36 there is another new low at 165-
hence another black line. We now have three consecutiveb lack lines.
Becauseo f this, we can only draw a white line if the price exceedst he
high of the three previous black lines. In our example, this price would
be r77. As a result, our new price range is above \77 for a new white
turnaround line or under 155 for a new black line. At price 39 at r79, a
white turnaround line is drawn up to 179.
To summarize the method: If there are one or two black or white
lines, then a new line is added if the market reachesa new high or low.
However, if there are three consecutive white lines, the market must
move under the low of thesew hite lines to draw a black turnaround line.
If there are three consecutiveb lack lines, the high of these lines must be
exceededt o draw a white turnaround line.
TRADING TECHNIQUESW ITH THE THREE-LINE
BREAK CHART
White and Black Lines as Buy and Sell Signals
A serieso f alternating white and black lines, as shown in Exhibit 6.2(A),
reflects a trendless market. However, once three consecutivew hite or
black lines appear, as displayed in Exhibit 6.2(B), the market is in a trend-
ing mode. A basic trend reversal signal is produced when a turnaround
line moves under three consecutivew hite lines or above three consecu-
tive black lines. This is shown in Exhibit 6.2(C).
The most basic method of using the three-line break is buying on a
white line and selling on a black line. Remember that if there are three
consecutivew hite (black) lines, the market has to move under (above)
the low (high) of these three lines for a black (white) line to be con-

structed. Exhibit 6.3 shows buy and sell signals based on these criteria.
As can be seenf rom this example, some reversals ignalsi n the three-line
break chart are sent well after the new trend has started. However, many
traders are comfortable with this insofar as they believe that it is safer to
be in for the major part of the trend rather than trying to pick a top or
bottom. The three-line break tries to accomplisht his.
The three-line break chart requires a close to confirm a turnaround
line. However, by the time this confirmation is completed, the market
may have moved substantially away from where there may have been
an attractiveb uy or sell. A means around this problem is to use an intra-
sessionr eversals ignal as the time to lightly buy or sell. Then, if desired,
add more to the position if the turnaround line is confirmed. For example,
looking at Exhibit 6.3, Bl became a turnaround line once it closed above
$31 (the high of the three prior black lines). However, by the time the
turnaround line was corroborated, the market had closed near $33. A
trader could have bought lightly on an intra-day basis on the break above
$31 and then added on the close near $33. Of course, if the market had
failed to closea bove$ 31,t hen there would have been no turnaround line
formed. In such a scenario, the prudent action would be for the intra-

Three-Line Break Charts and Candle Charts
In Chapter 4, I examined the value of monitoring the market's prevailing
trend when using the candles. Since the three-line break chart defines
whether the market is in a bull or bear trend, it can be employed as an
adjunct to candle charts. The three-line break chart can help define the
prevailing trend, and the candlesc an be used as an entry mechanismt o
trade in the direction of the prevailing trend. For example, if there are
three white consecutivel ines, the major trend (as defined by the three-
line break) is up. Basedo n this, bullish candle signals could be used as
a buy signal, and bearish candle signals within this bull trend could be

used to cover shorts. Since candlesr arely help set price targets, a white
or black turnaround line can also be used as a signal to exit a trade
originally based on a candle signal.
In Exhibit 6.4(A), a three-line break chart shows that a black turn-
around line occurred after the price touched $29.50( the candle chart in
Exhibit 6.4(8) shows that there was another indication of a top with a
bearish engulfing pattern). The black turnaround line meant that the
trend had turned down. Basedo n the theory that a new position should
be placed in the direction of the major trend, traders should look for a
candle signal as a time to go short in the bear trend. However, bullish
candle signals in this bear market should either be ignored or used to
cover shorts.
In this case,I will show how to use the three-lineb reak chart in Exhibit
6.4(A) to fine tune trading with the candle chart in Exhibit 6.4(8).
In the candle chart in Exhibit 6.4(8), a hammer appearedo n Septem-
ber 3. The fact that the hammer came after a falling window was an
indication that the hammer should not have been a buy signal. A few

days after the hammer (on september 8), the market had weakened
enough to form the black turnaround line shown in Exhibit 6,.4(.{). At
that time, with a bear trend confirmed via the three-line break chart, the
rally into the window's resistancea rea a few days later could be used as
a selling opportunity.
Three-Line Break Charts and Trend
Exhibit 5.5(A) is a three-line break chart and Exhibit 6.5(8) is a candle
chart. Using these Exhibits, I will show how the insights about the overall
trend provided by the three-line break charts refine trading based on
candle signals.
From Exhibit 6.5(4), the trend turned bearish beginning at the black
turnaround line of L (which formed the first week of August). It is inter-
esting that before this black turnaround line appeared, the candle charts
gave a hint of a top with the hanging man line in |une. Throughout the

rest of the year, the market remained in a bear mode, as shown by the
continuous serieso f black lines in the three-line break chart. In this en-
vironment, candle signals to sell short should be acted upon since there
was a prevailing downward trend. A long white candled uring this period
gave a temporary respite to the selloff, but once the support area at the
bottom of this white candle was broken, it was a signal for lower prices.
'
At white turnaround line 2, the market transformed into a bull mode.
This means that bullish candle signals should be used as a buying op-
portunity. The bull trend lasted from January until the black turnaround
line in August. During this bull mode, observe how the market held
support near the midpoint of the tall white real bodies. February's high-
wave candle was an indication that the prior uptrend was in transition.
However, with the major trend still higher, and the long white candle
as suPPort, we could view sell-offs after the high-wave candle as correc-
tions in a bull trend. Another tall white candle in April becames upport
and provided a base for another upleg.
Hints of a bearish turnaround came with the harami, the hanging

man, and the long upper shadow candles during the summer of 1992,
but a bear trend was not confirmed with the threeline break chart until
the black turnaround line in August at line 3. From that point, we look
for bearish candle signals to sell the market. Note the doji in August in
Exhibit 6.5(8). This candle could be the warning of a trend reversal.
However, this doji appeared during a downtrend (as defined by the three-
line break), and should not be used as a signal to buy. A few weeks later,
a falling window appeared. This was a bearish signal in a bear trend;
thus, a sell was in order.
A bullish engulfing pattern on the candle chart and a white turn-
around line on the three-line break chart reflected that a new bull trend
had begun.
The new charts that I discuss in this and the next two chapters use
closing prices. Consequently, by allowing traders to use more than a line
chart, traders who use these markets are now given an extra dimension
of analysis.T he three-line chart of bond yields in Exhibit 6.6 is basedo n

closing price only. Yet, notice all the information this chart provides as
it signals reversals with the emergence of a white or black turnaround
line. Remembert hat when looking at three-line break charts in terms of
yield, the black lines are bullish since lower yields translate to higher
prices. This is why the buy signals on the chart are given with the black
turnaround line and sell signals on the white turnaround lines (a white
turnaround line means higher yields and lower prices).
Other Break Charts
Japaneset raders often adjust the sensitivity'of the three-line break chart
by changing the number of lines that the market has to break before a
turnaround line is drawn. The three-line break requires the breaking of
the last three white or black lines to get a reversal. As displayed in Exhibit
5.7(A), we see that a two-line break follows the same concept, except
that it uses two white or black lines as its reversalc riterion. Such a chart
is termed a two-line break chart. As displayed in Exhibit 6.2(B), for a
four-line break chart, the last four consecutivea nd samec olor lines have
to be exceededf or a new turnaround line to be drawn.
Shorter time frame traders would usually use shorter reversal amounts
(such as a two- or three-line break). Traders and investors who are look-
ing for major moves and are long-term oriented could use the five- or
even ten-line breaks. The most popular break chart in japan is the three-
line break chart; that is why my examples are based on the three-line
break chart. However, all the trading tools used in the three-line break
charts can be applied in the same way to any other break chart.
In Exhibit 6.3, shown earlier in this chapter, I highlighted the buy and
sell signals for Ford using a three-line break chart. Using the same date
as on Exhibit 6.3, I made a two-line break chart (Exhibit 6.8) and a five-
line break chart (Exhibit 6.9). Note how the frequency of buy and sell

of lines that have to be exceededt o get a turnaround line, the greatert he
sensitivity of the chart. Consequently, a two-line break is more sensitive
and will be more volatile than a three-line break chart. A five-line break
chart will be less sensitive and have fewer reversals than a three-line
break.

that works best in vour markets.

reversal, even after a turnaround line. They get this confirmation by

waiting for the line after a turnaround line to confirm the new trend. For
example,a s shown in Exhibit 6.10, a trader could wait for the white line
after the white turnaround line before buying. (Looking back at Exhibit
5.3, traders using this concept would not have bought at B2 since there
was only a white turnaround line.)
This idea of waiting for extra confirmation would, of course, involve
a tradeoff between risk and reward. The longer a trader waits for a con-

get a slow start and the profits will be smaller, the false moves will be
less and the safety factor will increase." This concept of waiting for ad-

moving averagev ersus a longer term one. Those who use a short-term
moving average get aboard the new trend earlier, but whipsaws are in-
creased.
Black Shoe, White and Black Suits, and a Neck
As displayed in Exhibit 5.1'1.a, short black line is sometimesc alled ablack
shoef or the obvious reason that such a line looks like a black shoe. A
white turnaround line (a white line that surpassest he prior three black
lines) is sometimesl ikened to a white suit.
The short white line that comes immediately after a white turnaround
line (i.e., a white suit) is called a necks ince it looks like a neck coming
out of the white suit.
"Buy
There is a Japanesee xpressionr egarding the three-line break:
when the neck emergesf rom the white suit with black shoes." The rea-
son for this expressioni s as follows:
1,.The small black line (the shoe) shows that the selling pressure may
be easing since the move towards lower prices is becoming more le-
thargic.
2. The white turnaround line is a bullish reversal signal.
3. The neck is the buy signal. The neck's short white line is viewed as
the market taking a breather after its prior advance (i.e., after the prior
white turnaround line). A short white line could also reflect that the
bears may have not yet covered their shorts (these who sold during
the series of black lines that came before the white turnaround line).
This could mean higher prices once these shorts decide to cover. Since
the neck is also the second white line after the white turnaround line,

it servesa s extra bullish confirmation. As discussedp reviously, some
traders prefer waiting for the secondw hite line as a buy signal.
In Exhibit 6.12, I show an example of a neck, a black suit, and a black
shoe. This black turnaround line is sometimes called a blacks uit. The
small black line after the black suit is the sell signal.
"sell
There is a saying that a trader should if the black shoe comes
out of a black suit after a neck." The meaning of this expressioni s ex-
plained below:
1. The diminutive real body at the top of the rally (i.e., the neck) shows
that either the buying pressurei s slackeningo r the selling pressurei s
enough to slow the bulls' advance.
2. The black turnaround line (the black suit) is a reversals ignal that tells
us that the bears have gained control.
3. The small black line (the shoe) means that the market is weak, but not
oversold. Also, it shows that the buyers on the way up (during the
series of white lines before the black turnaround line) may not have
liquidated as yet. This could mean that there is still more selling likely
to come when these existing longs decide to liquidate. The black shoe
after the black turnaround line also provides bearish confirmation
for these who prefer to wait for a second black line to get a reversal
signal.
I show in Exhibit 6.T3a bottom reversal signal in Septembera nd into
"buy
October that is based on the saying, when the neck emergesf rom
a white suit with black shoes." The small black line, i.e., a black shoe,
emerged near $42 in September. The white suit (another name for the
white turnaround line) came after this black shoe. Following the black
shoe, a white line, becauseo f its small size, was a neck, and hence a buy
"sell
signal. A top reversalp attern, grounded on the dictum, when black
shoesa re under a black suit after a neck," appearsa t the price peak near
$59. The small white line after the rally was a neck, the black turnaround
line after this neck was a black suit, and the confirmation of a sell came
with the small black shoe.

Record Sessions and Three-Line Break Charts
]ust as record sessionsa re important in candle charting, so this technique
is useful for some of the new charting techniques such as the three-line
break chart, and as we'll see later, kagi charts. When there are 8 to L0
consecutive or almost consecutive white lines, the market is viewed as
being overextended to the upside. When there are 8 to 10 black lines
during a downtrend, the market becomes vulnerable to a bounce.
One of my important sources of information has been the Nippon
Technical Analysis Association. I sent the NTAA member a copy of Ex-
hibit 6.14 with some questions about the three-line break chart. This
gentleman graciously addressed my questions, and he also placed the
numbers shown on each of the falling black lines. He did this to illustrate
how he uses record session counts as one of the techniques for trading
with the three-line break chart. We see in this chart that when the market

aspecto f this chart was that the NTAA member also placed an X and a
Y on the chart at the price peaks shown. He mentioned that this area
was resistanceo n any rebounds. Although it is not shown on this chart,
a rally in late 1993f ailed near this $60 resistancea rea and fell to near 945.
Thus, we can seet hat using an obvious resistancea rea, such as the dual
highs near $60, should be used with three line-break charts.

in Exhibit 5.L5 illustrate how a trendline and a resistancea rea can be
defined on a three-line break chart just as easily as on a candle chart.
A double top or tweezers top is also sometimesc alled a two-paired
chimney. In Exhibit 6.16, we see an example of such a pattern with the
dual highs at A and B near $74.
Exhibit 6.17 shows how trendlines on the three-line break chart can
be used as effectively as on a traditional bar chart. The breaking of the
uptrending support lines signaling that the uptrend was in the process
of changing. In addition this chart also displays that the bulls were losing
force since each of the major price peaks at shoulders 1, 2 and 3 were

Exhibit 6.18 disptays some of the tools that can be used to trade with
the three-line break chart. A downward sloping resistance line was
pierced in early 1993.A lso of interest in this chart is the prior resistance

PRACTICE SESSION FOR THE
THREE-LINE BREAK CHART
Frt
I o reinforce your understanding of the three-line break chart, use the
closing prices in Table 6.2, on the following page, to construct a three-
line break chart. The scaleo n the vertical axis should be set up from $23
to $30. You may photocopy and use the supplied graph shown on page
L93o r draw a rough scaleo n plain paper. The exact size of the white or
black lines is not important. The meaningful aspecto f this practicei s to
use your chart as a gauge to see how well you understand when a new
white or black line should be drawn.
After you construct the chart, comparei t to Table 6.3 and Exhibit 6.19
(on the pagesf ollowing the exercise)w here the actualc hart and the days
on which new lines were constructeda re shown.

CHAPTER7
RENKO CHARTS
& € A E N T f f i U A T N A
"Consider
the Pasta nd You WilI Know the Future"
Tn" renko chart, shown in Exhibit 7.'1,,i s also termed a neri, training,
or zigzag chart. The renko charts looks similar to the three-bar break
chart since they both have lines that look like blocks. The individual
blocks that form the renko chart are sometimes referred to as bricks( the
"Ienga,"
term renko may come from which is the Japanesew ord for
bricks).
As we saw in Chapter 6, in a three-bar break chart, another line is
added as the market moves in the direction of the prevailing trend, no
matter how small the move. For example, if the market closed today by
even one tick higher, a new white line would be added to the three-line
break chart if the prior line was white.
However, for a renko chart, a line is drawn in the direction of the
prior move only if a fixed amount has been exceeded. For example, if
iher" is a white brick on the renko chart, the market has to advance by
a predetermined fixed amount before a new white brick can be drawn.
Another difference between the renko and three-line break chart is
that the lines in the three-line break chart are of different sizes, while the
bricks in a renko chart are all the same size.

The renko chart uses closing prices. The first step is to choosea price
range unit. This price range point is the minimum amount the market
must move before a renko brick is drawn. The price range point also
servest o set the height of the brick. Thus, a five-point renko chart would
have bricks that are five points tall. This will become clear after I go
through the following detailede xample.A n important aspecto f the renko
chart is that rising lines are denoted by equal size white bricks and falling
lines are denoted by equal size black bricks. Thus, no matter how large
the move, it is shown on the renko chart as equal sized bricks. For ex-
ample in a five-point renko chart, a 20-point rally is displayed as four
five-point-high renko bricks.

200 The Dispaity lndex and New Price Charts
OUR EXAMPIE: We will use a five-
point renko chart. This means each
brick will be five points high. Our
base, or starting price, is 135.
Drawing the first brick: Compare the base price to the current close.
Rule 1. If the market rallies from
the basep rice:
A white brick (or a series of white
bricks) is drawn only if the market
Musta scendb y at least
moves above the base price by the ,/ the chosenp ricer ange
ros;f
fixed amount or more. Thus, iI
there is a base price of 100 and we t l
are using a five-point renko chart, tool J 4"." pri."
then the market has to move up to
at least 105 before a white brick is
drawn.
Nofe:P rices should touch or exceed
the prior high or low by the point
amount for a brick to be drawn.
This is different from the three-line
break chart, where the price should
exceed the prior high or low.
If the market moves up by more
than what would be required to tttfll
draw one brick, but less than
1o7
needed to draw two bricks, only rosp\ /T s h nisi os n wot n bricks
one brick is drawn. For example,
0,,.*
in a five-point renko chart, if the ,o[of- on" ,: ilirwo
base price is 100 and the market
moves to 107,t hen one white renko
brick is drawn from the base price 7 pointr allyf rom 10 pointr ally
100 to 107 in a five in a five unit
of 100 up to 105. The rest of the unit renko chart reoko chart
move-from 105 to 107-is not
shown on the renko chart. How-
ever, if the market had moved up
to 110, then there would be two
five-point-tall white bricks. A move
to 112 would also have two white
bricks. The portion of the rally from
110t o 112 would not show.
or
Rule 2. If the market falls from the
basep rice:

==================================================

RenkoC harts 201
Draw a black brick only when the ',.1.-
price declinesf rom the baseb y the
fixed amount or more (in this ex- *-***
ample, five points). Thus, with a
base price of L00, the market has to
decline to 95 or lower before a black amounot r more
brick is drawn. The first black brick
startsf rom the basep rice and goes
down by the fixed point amount.
If the decline is more than the t*
fixed point, but less than twice the
minimum amount, then draw only la
rhisp orrioisn
one black brick. As an example, a nots hown
nr,l
decline from a base price of 100
down to 92 on a renko chart would 8 pointd ecline
from100to 92
have one five-point black brick
from 100t o 95.
.1 :l
However. if there was a decline
of, for example, 13 points, then two
black bricks would be drawn. If the
I
market fell by 15 points, there
would be three black bricks, with
eachb rick in a separatec olumn.
13 pointd ecline
or from100t o 87
Rule 3. If the market moves up or 15 pointd ecline
from100t o 85
down by less than the minimum
fixed point (in this case, five
points), then no bricks are drawn.
For example, for a five-point chart
and a base price of L00, until the
market goes up to L05 or down to
95, there is no brick shown.
OUR EXAMPLE: In Table 7.1, the
base price is at 135. Since this ex-
ample is a five-point renko chart,
to draw a black brick the market
has to move to L30 or lower (i.e.,
five points under the 135 base
price). For a white brick, the mar- 1,.t,-..-;
ket would have to ascendt o 140o r
higher (i.e., five points above the
135 base price). At session 2, the
market fell to 132 or three points
(135t o 132).T his was not enough
to draw a black brick since it was
less than the minimum figb points
needed. By session 3, prices had

moved down to L28. This was now
seven points under the base price
of 135. This seven-point fall is
enough to draw one black brick.
Thus, at session 3, we draw one
five-point black brick from 135 to
130.
Drawing the next brick: Compare today's close with the high and low of
the last brick.
Rule 4. If today's closei s above the
top of the last brick (whether that

means that if the bottom of the last tu

or
Rule 5. If the price is under the
high or abovet he bottom of the last
brick, then nothing is drawn.

The next time the market reached
(BaPsreic e)
either L40o r higher or 125o r lower
was at session 11, with a price of
I
145. At that time, we drew two l:: *,."".,
five-point white bricks from the
prior high of 135 to the new high
at 145.
Drawing the next bricks: Using the data from Table 7.1,d raw the rest of
the chart shown in Exhibit 7.1,b y the same processj ust discussed.F or
example, let's look at session1 2 on Table 7.1. At that sessiont he price
was L58.T he prior high, at session1 L, was 145.w e thus draw two five-
point white bricks from the high of the prior renko brick at 145 up to 155
(the rest of the move from 155 to 158 is not shown on the renko chart).
with the high of the last brick (at session 12) at 155 and the low of that
brick at L50, we need the market to move either to 160 or higher for a
white brick, or 145 or under for a black brick. Thus, at session 14 the
market fell enough (to 143) to draw a new black brick down to 145.
TRADING TECHNIQUES WITH RENKO CHARTS
Unlike the varied trading techniques applicable with three-line break
charts and kagi charts (discussedi n the next chapter), the renko charts
are more limited. The only trend reversal signals with renko charts are
with the emergence of a bullish white brick or bearish black brick. Buv
and sell signalsb ased on this technique are shown in Exhibit 7.2.
As shown in that exhibit, buy signals (shown by the letter B) are
generated with the appearance of a white brick. Sell signals (shown by
S) are produced when a black brick appears. since the renko chart is a
trend-following technique, there will be times when the market is in a
lateral trading band. In such an environment there may be whipsaws
(see B1-S1,B e-Ss,a nd Ba-Sf. However, the expectation with a trend-
following technique such as this is that it allows traders to ride on the

produced at 82-52,B s-Ss,a nd B5-Su.
Exhibit 7.3 shows the advantageso ffered by a renko chart in a trend-
ing market. The buy signals come with the arrival of a white renko brick
and the sell signals with a black brick. Only when the market shifted into
a lateral range at L did the renko chart induce in and out trading.
In Exhibit 7.4 we take a longer term bond chart to seeh ow the renko
chart could be used as a technical tool to buy. When the market shifts
into a neutral band, as it did at areas1 and 2 on the chart, then the renko
chart may induce more volatile trading. However, this chart did allow a
long to enter and capture the bulk of the 1993 rally while keeping him
out of the market for most of the late 1993- earlv 1994s elloff.

CHAPTER8
KAGI CHARTS
X rU{tE 0 t
"Like
the Right Arm Helping the Left"
FF
I he Kagi chart is thought to have been createda round the time that the
Japaneses tock market started trading in the 1870s.A kagi chart is shown
"kagi,"
in Exhibit 8.1. The name kagi chart comesf rom the ]apanesew ord
which was an old fashioned key that had an L-shaped head. This is the
reasont hat kagi charts are also calledk ey chartsb y some] apanese.O ther
names for the kagi chart include the price range chart, the hook chart,
the delta chart, and the string chart.
".
A fapaneseb ook on kagi stated, . . just as candlec hartsa re superior
to bar charts, so key charts are superior to point and figure charts"l I am
not enough of an expert on point and figure charts to agree or disagree
with that statement. \tvhat I can state with certainty, however, is that
kagi charts will open new and rich methods of analysis that are unavail-
able with any other chart.
The basic premise of the kagi chart is that the thickness and the di-
rection of the kagi lines are dependent on the market's action. If the
market continues to move in the direction of the prior kagi line, that line
is extended. However, if the market reversesb y a predetermined amount,
a new kagi line is drawn in the next column in the opposite direction.
An interesting aspect of the kagi chart is that when prices penetrate a
prior low or high, the thickness of the kagi line changes. The thick kagi
line is called a yang line and the thin kagi line is called a yin line. Later
in this chapter, I will detail how to construct and interpret the yang and
yin lines. The short horizontal line on the kagi chart is labeled the inflec-
tion line.

CONSTRUCTIONO F KAGI CHARTS
Kagi charts are most commonly based on closing prices. Before starting
the kagi chart, a turnaround (i.e., or reversal) amount must be chosen.
This is the minimum price movement that is neededb efore a new reversal
line can be drawn in the next column. For instance, if the turnaround
amount is S3, and if there is a rising line, today's price must closel ower
by at least $3 before a falling turnaround line can be drawn. This will be
becomec lear when I get into more detail about the construction of the
kagi chart. For kagi charts, the turnaround amount can be touched or
exceededf or a reversal line to be drawn.
OUR EXAMPLE: The starting
price, as shown at session 1 in
Table 8.L, is 135. The turn-
around amount in this example
will be four points.

216 The Disparity lndex and New Pice Charts
Drawing the first line: Compare today's price to the base price.
Rule 1. If today's price is higher Today'sp rice
than the base price by the turn-
around amount or more (in our ex-
ample, this would mean four or Basep rice
more points from the starting
price), then a thick (yang) line is
drawn from the starting price to the
new high closing price.
Nofe: To draw a line, the change in
price should be the same or greater
than the turnaround amount.
Rule 2. If today's price is lower Basep rice
than the base price by the prede-
termined turnaround amount or
more, then draw a thin (yin) line Today'sp rice
from the starting price down to to-
day's price.
Rule 3. If the difference between
the current close and the base price
is less than the minimum turn-
around amount (in our case, four
points), no line is drawn
OUREXAMPLE: The starting price
is 135. During the next session, the
market moved down to132. This is
less than the predetermined turn- 135 (Base price)
around amount of four points, so
we cannot yet draw a line. At ses-
sion 3, the price had fallen to 128. 128( Sessio3n)
Now, the market had dropped
more than the four points needed
to draw the first line (from session
1 to session 3, prices fell seven
points). Thus, we draw a thin yin
line ftecause the market moved
down) from the starting price of 135
down to 128.
Drawing the secondl ine: Compare today's price to the tip (i.e., the bot-
tom or the top) of the last kagi line. In our example, the bottom of the
line is L28 and the top is 135, so we would compare the more current
price to 135 and L28.

Rule 4. if the price continues in the
same direction as the prior line, the
line is extended in the same direc-
tion, no matter how small the
move. Thus, in our example, if the
price fell to \27, we would then ex-
tend the yin line down from L28 to
127. However, if the first line is a Newh ighc lose

the last line was at 128. Since we
need a four-point turnaround, the
market would have to close at 132

Rule 6. If the market moves in the
opposite direction to the preceding
trend by less than the turnaround
amount, then that session is ig-

points (from 128 to 133). This was (Session3 )
enough of a move (since the turn-
around amount was four points) to
draw a new line in the opposite di-
rection to the prior line. As a re-
sult, we move a column to the right
by drawing a short horizontal line
(the inflection line) and then draw
a line going up. This line starts at
L28a nd goes up to 133.

Drawing the third line: We again compare the most recent kagi line with
today's price. Using our example, the last kagi line stopped at 133. So
we now compare today's price to 133.

from L33 to 130, the decline was

The next time a new line is added
is at session 6. At session 5, the
price is at 729 or four points under
the bottom of the prior kagi line at

At session 8, the price has moved

up to 134. This is a seven-point
rally from the low of the prior kagi I Aboveh ereli nec hanges

line at 127-more than enough to
draw a rising turnaround line.
127 (Session7 )
We then shift to a new column, and
draw a line up from 127 to 134.
Note how this line changed from
narrow to thick once the price ex-
ceededt he prior high at 133. This
brings out one of the major fea-
tures about kagi charts. Specifi-
cally:
Rule 1,0. If a narrow line in a kagi Line changes from
thin lo thick
chart exceedst he prior high, at the
when price exceeds
point where the previous high was priors houlder
(i.e.h igh)
exceeded,t he line becomes thick.
The preceding high is called a
shoulder.

when pricef alls under
is called a waist. prior waist (i.e. low)
OUR EXAMPLE: For the rest of this discussion,s eeT able 8.1 and Exhibit
8.1.
As described in Rule 11 above, the line changes from thick to thin
when a prior low is broken. Note how in Exhibit 8.L there were times
whentthe market reversed price action, but these reversals weie not
enough to break a preceding to* (for example, from session 19 to 20).
Thus, the line's thickness did not change. However, at session3 0, the
price at L55 broke under the prior low at 169 (at session 25). Conse-,
quently, when the kagi line for session 30 is drawn, once the price of
that line moves under the prior low of 169, it changes from thick to thin
(from a yang to yin line). Observe how at session3 8 the market broke a
prior high and, as such, went from a thin yin line to a thick yang line.
Using PercentageK agi Charts
A problem in using a fixed price turnaround amount is that the reversal
amount may have to be adjusted depending on the stock's price. A $1



==================================================
                     PAGE 223                     
==================================================

220 The Dispaity lndex and New Price Charts
turnaround may be acceptablef or a $20 or $30 stock, but a $1 turnaround
would be too high for a $5 stock and too low for a $100 stock. The kagi
chart has a unique and powerful approach to this problem-it offers the
ability to use a fixed percentage reversal amount instead of a fixed price.
For example, in a 3o/ok agi chart, if the chart starts at $50, the first
turnaround price will be $1.50 (3o/oo f $50). If the stock rises to gZ0, the
turnaround price would be $2.10( 3o/oo f $70). Thus, as the stock's price
rises, the turnaround price would automatically increase, and if the price
falls, the turnaround price would decrease.
Using percentagek agi charts is not as common as the fixed price kagi
in |apan. This is becausem any fapaneset raders prefer to draw the kagi
charts by hand, and doing percentage changes is relatively time consum-
ing. However, with computer software now available for kagi charting
(seet he EQUIS, MetaStocks oftware information at the end of this book),
traders can now easily use percentaget urnarounds.
Whether a trader uses a fixed price or a fixed percentage unit as a
reversal, the amount chosen for the turnaround lines is an individual
preference depending on a trader's time frame and trading style. An
expert in kagi from the Nippon Technical Analysts Association passed
on to me that, as a general rule, he uses a 3olotu rnaround level for stocks.
The 5olok agi also appearsp opular for longer term traders.
TRADING TECHNIQUES WITH THE KAGI CHART
Buy on Yangr Sell on Yin
The are many ways to use kagi charts, but the most basic is to buy when
the kagi line goes from thin to thick, and to sell when the kagi line
changes from thick to thin. Remember that the kagi line becomes thick
(i.e., becomesa yang line) when the prior high is exceeded.T he kagi line
converts to a thin yin line when a prior low is broken.
In Exhibit 8.2, I show basic kagi buy and sell signals. The buys occur
with the emergence of a yang (thick) line, and sell signals unfold when
the kagi line converts to a yin line (i.e., thin). As can be seen, when the
market trades sideways, the buy and sell signals can induce losses( for
example, from 82 to 52 and from 83 to s3). This is becausek agi charts,
like renko and three-line break charts, are trending tools, and in non-
trending markets can cause traders to frequently move in and out of the
market. (There are ways to circumvent this, for example, by adjusting
the sensitivity. This will be discussedl ater.) However, the goal of the
kagi chart is to catch longer term trends. This was accomptishedb etween
the buy at Ba and the offsetting sale at Sa. A constructive aspect of this

Shoulders and Waists
A shoulder is a prior high and a waist is a former low. A serieso f shoul-

information about the underlying tone of the market. As shown in Exhibit

Stock mutual funds prices are based only on the close. Because
candlestickc harts require the open, high, low, and closing prices, they
cannot be used to analyze stock mutual funds. Now, however, we can
technically analyze mutual funds with three-line break, renko and kagi
charts,s incet heset echniqueso nly require the close.I n Exhibit 8.5 I show
that comparing the heights of the shoulders and waists can be used to

Multi-Level Breaks
In Chapter 6, I discussedh ow Japaneset raders may wait for extra con-
firmation in the three-line break chart by waiting for an additional white
or black line. The same strategy can be used with kagi charts. In the kagi
chart, this entails waiting for two or more prior highs or lows to be
penetrated. In Exhibit 8.6., I illustrate how each former high or low is
referred to as a leuel.A s illustrated in Exhibit 8.6(A), the thick yang line
converts to a thin yin line when the first level (i.e., the previous waist,
W) is broken. However, some traders may wait for a two-level break,
meaning that the two prior lows at W1 and W2 are broken before a sell
signal is confirmed. Exhibit 8.6,(8)s hows a three-levelb reak. This means
that the rally has to exceedt he prior three highs (the prior three shoulders
Sr-Ss)b efore a buy is confirmed.
As is the case with any technique where extra confirmation requires
extra time, there is less profit potential once the trend is confirmed since
this confirmation takes longer. However, the extra confirmation should
mean greater probability that the trend has changed. We come back to
the immutable law of risk and reward. The less the risk, the less the
reward.
In Exhibit 8.7, a serieso f lower highs (marked sr-ss) and lower lows
(marked Wr-Ws) manifesteda weakening market. However, this cycle of
lower highs and lows was broken with the higher high at 56. Area 55
was also a two-level break since it moved above the prior two highs (at
Saa nd S5).F urther reinforcing the view that this market was bottoming
was that the pullback from 56 stopped above the prior low at w5. This
was the first time in many months that a low (at W6) was higher than
the previous low (at Ws).

yin sections.T his means that the bulls had a stronger grip on the market
than did the bears. In kagi line 4, the longer height of the yin line as
compared to the yang line kept a bearish undertone to the market.
Where Corrections Stop Within the Prior Kagi Line
Where a corrections tops within a kagi line can be used as a gauge of the
market's health. specifically, in kagi charting, the center of a long kagi
line is important. If, as shown in Exhibit 8.10(,{),t he market correctsa fter
a rally, and this correction stops before touching the center of a prior
long kagi line, it is bullish. Such a scenariod isplays that the bulls kept
the bears from progressing steeply into the bulls' domain. If, in this
scenario,t he market then exceedst he prior shoulder, it is a buy signal
sincei t is a time when the bulls have regained full control of the market.
If, during a downtrend, a rally fails to pierce the midway point of a

prior long kagi line, then it is a negative signal insofar as the butls were
not aggressive enough to push prices above the midway point of the
prior line. This is shown in Exhibit 8.10(8).'once the market declines
past the previous low, it is viewed as a sign to sell since it is at that point
where the bears have wrested control of the market.
Note that it is usually in the longer kagi lines that the midpoint be-
comes important. This is similar to the middle of long white or black
candles taking on significance.
In Exhibit 8.1"1,I display the middle of some long kagi lines by the
letter M. we see how M1 becamea support area as the low of kagi line
t held above M1. Midpoint M2 had extra importance since M2 wai also
above the prior highs made from March through May in the 109-110
area. The fact that the pullback via kagi line 2 held above these old highs
and also held above Mz relayed the underlying strength of the market.
Area M3 became support on the correction made with the selloff at kagi
line 3. Kagi line 4 broke the support area set up by Mr. Thus far, not
only has the market failed to push above the new resistancea rea set up
by Mn, but it has not even managed to push above the lows set by kagi
line 3 (remember the technical axiom that old support can convert to new
resistance).
Double Windows
Double windows can be top or bottom reversalp atterns. (Note: a double
window in kagi charting is different from a window in candle charts.) As
illustrated in Exhibit 8.12(,4),a double window bottom is formed when:
t. during a downtrend, the market bounces and forms a shoulder (at
S). This shoulder's high is less than the prior waist's low (W).
2. the following waist (shown as W2) is also above shoulder 51.

This is called a double window becauseb oth waists W1 and W2 are above
the intervening shoulder (i.e. S). It is like having a price gap (i.e. an
open window) between the high at shoulder 51 and the lows at waists
to the left and right of this shoulder. If there is more than one shoulder,
it would still be considered a double window if the highest shoulder does
not overlap the waists to the left and right. This is shown in Exhibit
8.12(B).
Double window tops are shown in Exhibits 8.12(C)a nd 8.12(D).T he
double window top is formed when:
1.. during an uptrend the left shoulder (shown by S) is below the fol-
lowing waist (shown by Wj and
2. the next shoulder (at S) is also below W1.
In other words, the shoulders at 51 and 52 that surround the inter-
vening waist (W) are both under W1. Exhibit 8.12(D) illustrates how it
is also a double window top if the lowest waist in a group of waists is
still higher than the two shoulders at 51 and 52.

step process.F irst, we seea low waist at W1. The next step is to compare
the waist (W) to the next shoulder or group of shoulders. In this chart,
a series of shoulders marked 1 through 5 was built during February and
March. Note how waist W1 was above the highest shoulder Sa.F inally,
after the highs of these shoulders are exceeded,w e see if the next waist
(W) is higher than the highest shoulder (which was shoulder 4). Since
this criterion was met, we have a double window bottom. In this chart
it is also interesting to see how the support from December through
January became converted to resistance, as evidenced by shoulders 1
through 5. The market breaks this resistancea rea, and the double win-
dows are two bullish signals.
In Exhibit 8.14, inlate 1993,w e seea double window top. This pattern
was formed since the lowest waist (at 2) was above the surrounding
shouldersa t 1 and 3. Another double window top unfolded in early 1994.
For that window we can easily see how shoulder A was below the next
group of waists (at B and C) but it is not as clear that shoulder D is below
B. However, the low at B was 114-6l32ndsa nd the high at D was

at B and the next shoulder at D. As a result, a double window top was
completed. The ovals that I used to illustrate the two double windows
in this chart are the traditional method used by the japanese to show
double windows.
Trendlines
As shown in Exhibit 8.15, the highs during the decline that began in late
1992 werc defined by a downward sloping resistancel ine. of interest
during this decline is that the rebounds (shown by Sl through 55)p ushed
up halfway or less into kagi lines 1 through 6. This showed that the
counterattacksb y the bulls were relatively feeble. The first sign that the
bulls were starting to get a grip on this market was that the low at Y was
not lower than the low at X. This was the first time in many months that
a lower low was not formed. Areas X and Y formed a double bottom.

This provided enough of a base for a minor rally. This rally's support
area was a rising trendline that started at Y. Another rising trendline was
formed with the ascending lows from August.
The change of polarity principle can be used (where prior support
becomesr esistancea nd vice versa) with kagi charts since a prior support
of resistancea rea is so evident on a kagi chart. For example, in Exhibit

In Exhibit 8.19, I show some ways traders can determine if the three_
Buddha top can be more bearish or a reverset hree-Buddham ore bullish.
For example, Exhibit 8.19(4) illustrates how the rebound from the right
Buddha stalled under the center of the prior long kagi line. This reflected

A three-Buddhat op is shown in Exhibit 8.20. The first bearish signal
was given with the break of the uptrend support line. More confirmation
came with the one-level break. For traders who prefer even more bearish
corroboration, the two-level break could have been viewed as extra con-
firmation of a top.

Exhibit 8.21 displays a classic inverted three-Buddha pattern where
the two waists at Wl and W2 are about the same price. By breaking above
shoulders 51 and 52 (shown at the arrow) the inverted three-Buddha
pattern was confirmed with a two-level break. Note how the old resis-
tance area at shoulders 51 and 52 became support and the market con-
tinued to advance with a series of higher waists and higher shoulders.
Record Sessions
A key element used by ]apanese traders in candles and kagi charts is the
concept of record sessions.T hese are the same record sessionsa s dis-
cussedi n Chapter 3, on candlestickp atterns. In the contexto f kagi charts,
record sessionsa re the counting of the shoulders or the waists. As shown
in Exhibit d.22, a sequenceo f nine higher shoulders (not necessarilyc on-
secutive) is called nine record session highs. Likewise, a group of nine
lower waists is called nine record session lows. The ]apanese view a
market that has about nine record highs or lows as a time to look for a
countertrend move.

shows a five minute kagi chart. This means that the close of each five
minute segment during the day is used to compose the kagi chart. All
the rules to draw the kagi chart and any of the trading techniques pre-
viously addressedc an be used on an intra-day kagi chart. In this chart
we see an evident resistance area near 453 in late April and early Muy.
An ascending support line was punctured on May 6th. |ust before the
break of this support line the market reached a new high for the prior
move (at X) and from there a series of nine lower lows emerged. This
formed 9 record sessionl ows and increasedt he likelihood of a bounce.
In addition, the lows made on May 9 and L0 formed a double window
bottom.
Exhibit 8.25 shows one of the key advantageso f kagi charts-it allows
a more detailed analysis of markets, such as mutual funds, that have only
closing prices. In this example of the Magellen Fund there various kagi

1. The market relayed its underlying strength when price retracements
held above the middle of long kagi lines marked by r, 2 and 3. How-
ever, when the bears were aggressivee nough to drag prices under
the middle of long kagi line 3 (at the arrow) it was a clue that the
underlying market condition had changed.
2. The serieso f ascendingh ighs at A through E and rising lows A' to F'
representeda firming market. Warning of a loss of upside drive came
via the lower high at F and the lower low at G'.
3. From late 1992t o late 1993t he length of the yang portion of the kagi
lines was longer than the yin portion of those lines. This represented
that the bulls were more in control of the market than were the bears.
But with long kagi line 3 (the same line that broke under the middle
of the prior long kagi line), the longer yin portion of the kagi line,
relative to the yang line, reflecteda time when the bearsh ad grabbed
control of the market.

CONCLUSION
In this book, I have discussedc andlestick charts, the disparity index,
three-lineb reaks, and renko and kagi charts.W ith all of theset echniques,
the question that may arise is: \Alhich is the best?I cannot say that kagi
charts are better than three-line break or candle charts. They each have
their advantagesa nd uses.F or example,k agi, three-lineb reak, and renko
charts are useful for providing a view of the market on a macro scale.
Candlestickc harts can be used on a micro scaleb y providing early clues
about market reversals.F or example, a member of the Nippon Technical
Analysts Society told me that he uses kagi charts and other japanese
tools, but waits for a candle signal before placing a trade.
In the Introduction to this book, I quoted a samurai who said that,
"Learning
is the gate, not the house. You first have to go through the
gate to get to the house." Now, I have taken you through the gate and
up to the door of the house. However, as a ]apanese proverb states,
"Your
teacherc an lead you to the door; acquiring of learning then rests
on you."
With the help of this book, I hope that you have learned enough to
lay the foundation of basic conceptso n which you can build. The tech-
niques I examined should be viewed as basic tools that you can adjust
to your individual trading needs and style. There are so many ways to
use these exciting and powerful tools.
Each trader will find that experimenting with the three-line break,
renki, and kagi charts will depend on individual factors such as trading
style, risk adversity, and trading time frame orientation. There are no

Blendedc andle-a single candle line built by combining two or more candle
lines of a candle pattern. The blended candle can be used to help
determine whether a group of candle lines is bullish or bearish. To
construct the blended candle:
L. The oPen of the blended candle is the open of the first sessiono f
the candle pattern.
2. The top of the upper shadow of the blended candle is the highest
high of the candle pattern (i.e., the top of the highest Jpper
shadow).
3. The low of the blended candle's lower shadow is the lowest low
of all the sessionso f that pattern (i.e., the bottom of the lowest
lower shadow).
4. The closeo f the blended candle is the close of the candle pattern,s
last session.

Collapsingd oji star-a top reversal signal made up of three lines. The first
is a tall white candle after which the market gaps lower via a falling
doii. The third candle of this pattern is a black real body sessiont hat
gaps under the doji's session. The three candles that make up this
pattern are the same three as those needed for an evening doji star
(Seee zteningS tar). The differencei s that the evening doji star has the
doji above the tall white real body while the collapsing doji star has
the doji gapping under, instead of above, the first white candle.

IGgi chart-One of the three types of fapanesec harts (seea lso renko and

The basic premise of the kagi chart is that the thickness and the di-
rection of the kagi lines are dependent on the market's action. If the
market continues to move in the direction of the prior kagi line, that
line is extended. However, if the market reversesb y a predetermined
amount, a new kagi line is drawn in the next column in the opposite
direction. When prices penetrate a prior low or high, the thickness of
the kagi line changes. The kagi chart can be constructed using per-
centage or fixed amount reversals. See also inflection line, yang line,
and yin line.

of the session is near the low, and the close is near the high. The
length of the real body should be at least three times the length of
recent real bodies. Some of the uses of long white real bodies include
helping to confirm support and reinforcing the importanceo f a break-
out from a resistancea rea. The long white candle can also be used as
a support area. The support should be from midway of the white
candle down to the bottom of the white candle (this includes the

Morning star-a bottom reversal pattern composed of three candle lines.
During a downtrend there is a black real body. This is the first part
of the pattern. The second session is a small real body candle that
does not touch the first (i.e. black) real body. The second real body
can be white or black. The last session of the morning star is a long
white real body that ideally should not touch the second real body.
This long white real body should close well into the first candle's
black real body to complete this pattern. If the second candle of this
pattern is a doji instead of a small real body then this pattern becomes
a morning doji star.

and kagi charts) that does not consider time. In other words there is
no time scaleo n the horizontal axis. Rising lines are shown as white
and falling lines as black. when starting to draw a graph, the first
line is a rising white line if it rises, or the first line is a black falling
line if it declines.T hen, if the price exceedst he first line, a new white

the first line, then a black line is drawn in the next column. A new
