that are not producing the desired results, then take time to evaluate
your trading and begin to form new habits that will get you the results
you desire in trading. Chapter 13 has a worksheet titled “Twenty Sam-

HISTORY OF GEOMETRY IN THE MARKETS
Thehistoryoftechnicalanalysisanditsrelationshiptogeometrybeganin
the 1930s with the work of W.D. Gann. Gann became famous for the use
ofGannangles,whicharenowfoundinmanychartingsoftwarepackages.
These angles were especially well known for the 45-degree line and his
square of 9 charts, which basically divided a circle into 12 30-degree sec-
tions. In fact, this was a way of using harmonic numbers (see Chapter 3
on harmonic numbers), but was arrived at very differently than how we
discusstheminthisbook.

mid-1980s for $25,000. Extremely rare and less than 100 pages long, the

the progression of the Fibonacci series using diagrams of birds, fish, and

FIBONACCI RATIOS
So what are Fibonacci ratios, and where did they come from? Let’s start
with what they are; we will go back to ancient times to answer this ques-
tion. Pythagoras (ca. 580–500 B.C.E.) is considered to be the father of
moderngeometry.HewasalsoagreatphilosopherofancientGreeceand
founderofthePythagoreanbrotherhood.Heandhisstudentsbelievedand
taught that reality is mathematical in nature. They believed that numbers
and proportion were harmonic and that everything was related through

On our time line we now move forward to Pisa, Italy, in the twelfth
century A.D. It was here that Leonardo of Pisa (ca. 1170–1240) was born.

Leonardo initially studied mathematics with a system derived from
Roman numerals. He would soon make an enormous contribution to the
evolution of mathematics that remains with us today. He had learned the
Eastern (Indian) system of using nine numerals and studied intensively
withmathematicians inseveral Mediterranean countries. Itisknownthat

We want to note here that we do not always get a perfect support or
resistance at a Fibonacci ratio, as you will see in the many chart exam-

a range trading environment (contracting) versus a trending environment
(expanding).
Theapproachusinggeometrictrianglesissimpleinthatwearelooking
atpointsthatconnectfromhighstolowsandviceversa.Trianglesthatare
contractingarecontractingbythenumbersof.618and.786.
Triangles that are equal are those that have AB=CD legs (see
Chapter 4 on the AB=CD pattern). The triangles that are expanding are
expandingtothe1.272andthe1.618ratios.Patternsthathavetobeforced
are usually in the asymmetrical category and should be avoided. There
are many opportunities with well-formed symmetrical patterns, and the
trader should focus on those. Refer back to Figure 2.3. As with any trad-
ingmethod,alltradesareonlyaprobabilityandneveracertainty.
What you will observe as you study and learn these patterns is that
some stocks and markets tend to repeat one Fibonacci ratio more than
others.Asanexample,youmaynoticethataparticularstocktendstotrade
to the .786 more frequently than the .618. Or you may notice one of the
secondary numbers more frequently in one stock or market, such as the
.707.Itwillbehelpfultonotetheseobservationswhenyouseethem.
SUMMARY
Asyoucanseeinareviewofthischapter,geometryandthepricepatterns
formedareinterchangeable.Geometryisanimportantfoundationforeach
pattern presented in this book. The patterns are all triangles of varying
degrees and sizes, and some we have given clever names to, such as the
Gartley“222”pattern(Chapter5)ortheButterflypattern(Chapter6).
The basic principles remain the same: These patterns are geometric;
they repeat and can be quantified. As you study and gain experience, you
willtrainyoureyetothesymmetricalversustheasymmetricalpatterns.
Asthoseofuswhohavestudiedandnowapplytheseprincipleshave
learned, these patterns based in geometry have always been in the price
chart, and it was a matter of someone teaching us how to see them. Our
hope is that many of you reading this book who have never looked at a
pricechartfromthisperspectivewillbeastakenaswewerewhenwefirst

DEFINING A HARMONIC NUMBER
Let’sstartwithadefinitionofthewordharmonicasitpertainstophysics:
Har-mon-ic—Physics—Any component of a periodic oscillation
whose frequency is an integral multiple of the fundamental fre-
quency.
As you study the markets or individual stocks, you will see that they
doonlyoneofthreethingsatanygiventime:
1. Moveup.
2. Movedown.
3. Movesideways.
Markets are always in a process of either expanding or contracting.
Generally,marketsspendmoretimecontracting—tradinginarange,trad-
ing sideways, forming support and resistance areas—than they do in a

VIBRATIONS IN PRICE SWINGS
Vibrations in the markets can be thought of as sound waves. The louder
the sound, the farther it will travel. Eventually the sound will lose mo-
mentumasittravels,andthemomentumwilldissipate.Thesameanalogy
could be used describing an object being dropped. The larger the object
and the greater the distance it is dropped, the larger the vibration that is
createdasitmeetswithasurface.Pricemovementisverysimilartothis.

It is possible to see increased volatility that creates strong vibrations
or price swings. The market will trade in both directions as market
participants battle back and forth until a winner is decided. Once the

If you study at least 100 samples of this particular swing in the euro
currency, you will discover that the swings will be related to this 70-pip
harmonic number by the expansion or contraction numbers of .618, .786,
1.272, or 1.618. Finding one-half of this harmonic, 35 pips, in the euro is

is to use 3 percent of the value of the stock, commodity, or currency. If

HISTORY OF THE AB=CD PATTERN
In 1935 a book was published for sale to investors at an incredible price
of $1,500. Thatbook was Profits in the Stock Market byH.M.Gartley.On
page 249, under “Practical Use of Trend Lines,” Gartley describes a chart
patternthatwenowcalltheAB=CDpattern.(SeeFigure4.1.)

AB=CD PATTERN DESCRIPTION
Gartley’s description of the AB=CD pattern illustrated how the market
would rallyinanuptrend and thenretrace. Itwould then rallytoanother
uptrend then make another retracement, forming an upsloping parallel
channel.ItwasfromthisdescriptionthattheAB=CDpatternachievedits
nickname,thelightningbolt.(SeeFigure4.1.)
Gartley spent several pages referring to these trend lines and parallel
lines as excellent signals when used in conjunction with other working
tools.Healsoappliedtheselinestopriceratios.Heusedmainlyratiosof
one-thirdandone-halfforretracements.
AB=CD PATTERN STRUCTURE
The AB=CD pattern isfound inall markets and all timeframes. This pat-
tern is the foundation for the Gartley buy and sell patterns (discussed in
Chapter 5). It is also an integral part of the Butterfly pattern (Chapter 6)
andalsoformsapartoftheThreeDrivespattern(Chapter7).Thepattern

IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
AB=CD PATTERN
About40percentofthetime,theAB=CDpatternwillbeperfectlysymmet-
rical, meaning AB equals CD. The other 60 percent of the time variations
of the pattern will be present. What this means is that after the AB leg
has formed and the retracement leg, BC, has completed, the CD leg will
be different from the AB leg. The two legs may or may not be perfectly
symmetrical.
SomeofthewaystheCDlegcanvaryfromtheABleginclude:
Ĺ The CD leg is an extension of AB anywhere from 1.27 to 2.00 (or
greater).SeeFigure4.6asanexample.
Ĺ TheCDleghasaslopeoranglesteeperorwiderthanAB.
At first glance this variation might make the trader think the pattern
isnottradable.ThekeyliesinidentifyingtheBCleg.Themostimportant

SLOPE AND TIME FRAMES
The slope or time frame of the BC move can also be helpful in determin-
ing the pattern. BC legs generally correct to one of the Fibonacci ratios:
.382, .50, .618, or .786. The slope of this BC leg is usually a good indica-
tionofwhatthenextCDlegwillbe.Forexample,assumethattheABleg

andthepricehasnotbeenabletoretraceto.50,.618,or.786percent.We
wouldassumethatpriceswouldgomuchhigherandpossiblyquiterapidly
once the selling slows. However, if the market retraces to a .618 or .786
retracement, the CD leg will most probably be a normal move equaling
AB=CD.

Price action in any actively traded market can be broken down into
threesteps:
1. Upmoves.
2. Downmoves.
3. Sidewaysmoves.
The AB=CD pattern contains all three of these movements in a sim-
ple geometric form. Its trading value comes from its repetitive nature. It
measuresbuyingenthusiasmandsellingclimaxes.

The Gartley
“222” Pattern
The Gartley “222” pattern is certainly one of the classic retracement
patterns. It offers the trader early entry with minimum risk into a
potential longer-term trend reversal. For short-term day traders, the
pattern can be used effectively to buy and sell tests of highs and lows
on an intraday basis. Gartley said to buy or sell the first AB=CD pattern
in a new bear or bull market, and that is what this pattern can achieve
alongwithentriesintoanalreadyestablishedtrend.Amajorreversalmay
not always follow with this pattern, but even so the trader can still gain
profitsusinggoodtrademanagementskills(assumingthepatternisnota

HISTORY OF THE GARTLEY “222” PATTERN
The Gartley “222” pattern is named for the page number it is found on
in H.M. Gartley’s book, Profits in the Stock Market. Since then, multiple
bookshavebeenwrittendescribingtheGartley“222”patternandcharting

As mentioned earlier, the Gartley pattern can be found and traded in any
time frame. This particular pattern eliminates the need to pick tops and
bottoms,asitisaretestoftherecenthighorlow.Bydefinition,itisbuying
a higher low or selling a lower high, which is ideal for trading with the
trend. The trendisdefined by higher highs and higher lows inan uptrend

The following three trade examples using the Gartley “222” pattern
illustrate entry, exit, and stop placements. Refer to Chapter 13, “Build-
ing a Trading Plan,” to help you develop a personal trading plan for this
pattern.
We use two contracts in the futures or commodities trade examples
and 200 shares of stock to illustrate scaling out in two parts. We also

The second exit in this trade is at the .618 at 622.00. This particular

the second contract for a total of +44 cents per contract, which equals
$2,200.

masters—R.N. Elliott, W.D. Gann, and many others. He developed the
Wave Trader Program in 1988; it was the first computer program to use
all the numbers of sacred geometry, including the Fibonacci summation
series.ThispioneeringledtothediscoveryoftheButterflypattern.
The Wave Trader Program calculated each swing and ratio and went
throughasequenceofanalyzingthatlabeledthepatternsfrom1to10,10
being the level at which 10 swings and ratios came together at the same
time and price. This was the level when multiple patterns had completed
withtheratiosfromsacredgeometry.Bryceincludedallthenumbersfrom
sacredgeometrysothatnostonewasleftunturned.Aswithmanypatterns,
when the Wave 10 level trades failed it was usually an indication that the
marketwouldcontinueinthedirectionoftheoriginaltrend.
Bryce was a perfectionist in everything he attempted. On one occa-
sion he had done extensive analysis on the Treasury bond market and
hadconcludedthatT-bondswouldnotexceed101.00.HesoldT-bondsat
101.00andusedastop-lossorderat101.02,whichisexactly$62.50percon-
tract. When Larry suggested that the stop might be a bit too close, Bryce
shouted, “If those bonds trade above 101.02, everything I’ve researched,
read, and believe in will be a total loss!” He went on to say that if bonds
were to trade above 101.03, he would burn all of his books and materi-
als and return to race-car driving and playing golf in his home country of
Australia. The bonds made a swing high at 101.00 that lasted more than
twomonths.
The Butterfly pattern came into existence in 1992 on a trading day
when Larry was sitting with Bryce watching a Wave 10 pattern form. It
appearedinmanydifferentcolors,andastwocolorfulrighttrianglescame

should be very close to that of the CD leg in order to keep the ideal
symmetry in the pattern. Note also the time bar relationship in these

PSYCHOLOGY OF THE BUTTERFLY PATTERN
We have discussed previously in Chapter 4, “The AB=CD Pattern,” and
Chapter 5, “The Gartley ‘222’ Pattern,” how these patterns are formed by
basic fear and greed. When there are more buyers, the price rises; when
therearemoresellers,thepricedeclines.SincetheButterflypatternisan
extension pattern, is found for the most part at major tops and bottoms,
and often signals a major reversal point, then we can apply basic mass
crowd psychology and witness it at extremes. When this pattern is a ma-
jor reversal turning point in a market, what you will witness is a market
turnandmassesheadingforthedooratthesametime.Itisanextremein

At the tops, market participants start heading for the door trying to
sell. There is fear of losing money on wrong or early short positions, fear
of losing profits, profit taking on longs, or initiating new short positions.

either a reversal or part of a correction in a trend, where the market is

TheOpeningPriceRetracementpatternscanbeusedeitherfordaytrading

We use the opening price setups for stocks only and do not use them in
other markets. The concept is simple; the opening price will be near the
high or low of the day more than 60 percent of the time—that is, within
theupperorlower20percentrangeofthatday,accordingtoTheOpening
PricePrinciplebyLarryPesaventoandPeggyMacKay.
Thebestwaytoappreciatethissetupistostudychartsandtonotethe

notfullyknown.Onetheoryisthattradersandinvestorshavehad16to18
hours since the previous close to contemplate the next day’s orders, and
thoseordersareplacedneartheopenofthenextday.
When using the Opening Price Retracement setup, it is important to
useonlythecurrentday’sopeningpriceandtonotusethepreviousday’s

Managing Risk Using Multiple Time Frame
Examples and Fibonacci Retracement Setups
Using Fibonacci Retracement setups with multiple time frames is a natu-
ral combination. Many times a trader will come across a pattern that has
already completed on a larger time frame and observe that the trade has
alreadymovedintheanticipateddirection;thetradernowneedstofindan
entryintothetrade.UsingaFibonacciretracementlevelandthenscaling
down to a smaller time frame is an excellent method for entering a trade
inthatmanner.SeeFigure8.12fora60-minuteButterflypatternthatforms
andiscompletedonGooglestock.
Looking at Figure 8.12, the 1.272 extension of the Butterfly does not
hold,andthepatterniscompletedatthe1.618.Let’stakealooknowata
5-minute chart showing the 1.272 price level around $427.50 per share. If
thetraderhadenteredthereusingalowertimeframe,hewouldhavebeen
able to manage the risk in the trade with the use of a stop-loss order and
then reenter the trade at the 1.618 again using a 5-minute chart. Refer to
Figure8.13tostudythe1.272pricelevel.
The first thing to notice on this micro view of the 60-minute pattern
is that there is a gap-up open and a long, wide range bar. These are both
warningsignstoalertthetradertoeitherpassonthetradeorwaitforan-
other acceptable entry. The market during the day on the 5-minute chart
presents an opportunity for entry by forming a 5-minute Gartley sell pat-
tern. This offers a very low-risk entry into a very high-priced stock. The
riskinthistradeusingthissmall5-minutepatternandplacingthestopjust

BASICS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Everything in technical analysis starts with a single bar chart. This bar
chartisplottedonanx-axisandy-axisshowingtimeandprice.Theprice
bar represents the total sum of all buyers and sellers for that bar in that
timeframe.Theindividualpricebarsgiveagreatdealofinformation:
Ĺ Thehighpriceofthebar.
Ĺ Thelowpriceofthebar.
Ĺ Theopeningpriceofthebar.
Ĺ Theclosingpriceofthebar.
Ĺ Thetimeframeofthebar.
Volume is also involved in the formation of the bar. The reason a bar
forms is irrelevant; what is important is how multiple bars form in rela-
tion to one another over a period of time to create particular patterns
that repeat. It is important that the technical analyst learn to read these
bars as patterns and act appropriately when a pattern forms that offers a
tradingopportunity.

Figure 9.4 shows an example of using a Fibonacci ratio to move a
stop-loss order. The assumption is if the price exceeds the .786 it will
move beyond that level to the 1.00 or to an extension ratio such as the
1.272or1.618.

want to scale down to a smaller time frame for a pattern to enter on and

IDENTIFYING A TREND DAY
We first define a trend as higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend and
lower highs and lower lows in a downtrend. (See Figures 10.1 and 10.2.)
Trendscanmanifestonanytimeframe,shortorlong,andfortrendslonger
in duration the trend will be seen first on the shorter time frames. Strong
trends will open or close on or near the lows or highs and close at the
opposite end of the range. It is a mistake to assume when a trend is in
progress that a price has gone too high so therefore it is a short sale or
it has gone too low and therefore it is a buy. Prices can always move
further up or down than anyone expects. The percentage of trend days
is much smaller than the percentage of range or countertrend type days.
A typical trading month may see anywhere from two to five trend days
onaverage.

E-mini market. Higher highs and higher lows define the uptrend. On this day the

When trading from a short time frame such as a 5-minute chart, the
trader should be aware that a trend can manifest at any point during the

same direction. If traders see individual stocks that are not participating
in the trend, they should make a note of those and watch for patterns to
develop to trade those stocks. And if they see stocks that are leading the
trend,theycanalsomakeanoteofthosestockstowatchforsetupsinthe

PATTERNS FOUND ON TREND DAYS
Once traders have identified that a trend is under way, they will do best
trading in the direction of the trend. There are specific patterns that tend
toformduringthesetrends.Aswehavementionedpreviously,anyretrace-
mentsthatarepullbacksinatrendwillmostlikelyreachonlythe.382for
the strongest trends, and the .50 for other trends. There may or may not
beanAB=CDpatternwiththeseretracements,andthetradermaywantto
watchforconsolidation-typepatternstoformanduserepetitivecorrection
sizestotimeentriesintotrades.Mostofthecorrectionsorpullbacksthat
occur during a trend day will be shallow. The strongest trends will tend
tocorrectbetween1.25and3.5points.Generally,anycorrectionsorpull-
backs in a trend will not exceed 5.5 points. This helps the trader to place
stopswhentradingatrendday.

size of the correction: 4.5 points. The corrections tend to be very similar
in size on a trend day. On very strong trend days and if the trend accel-
erates, the corrections will become shallower. Trends are one of the few

In Figure 10.6 the trend day starts with a gap-up open. The price
does not attempt to fill in the gap area and instead makes a very shal-
low retracement of only 1.75 points before making highs on the day. The

CONTROLLING RISK ON A TREND DAY
If countertrend traders inadvertently find themselves in a trend day, they
can make a graceful exit by using the consolidation patterns as an exit.
Referring back to Figure 10.9 as an example, let’s assume a trader sells
the market at the .618 retracement level and initiates a 3-point stop, only
realizingthatatrenddayisinprogressonceinthetrade.Atthispoint,to

Ideally, on a trend day the trader would want to hold a core position

The assumption is that a true trend day will open on or near its lows and
close on or near its lows. The trader can then take off contracts and add

1382.25. This would gain 1.75 points, and the stop on the first position
can be moved to 1380.00, just below the last low. This leaves one open

As mentioned previously, the trader must learn to recognize varying mar-

successful trade. We do this by using specific warning signs and confir-

MONEY MANAGEMENT
Money management is the most important element of a trading plan. It is
a function of risk control and, if utilized properly, will allow traders to
trade through periods of drawdowns and losing streaks without blowing
out their accounts. In order to trade professionally and successfully, you
must learn to follow your trading plan, which includes a plan for money
management. Money management begins with an attitude: Again, traders
mustlearntothinkintermsofprobabilitiesandnotcertainties.Thisispar-
ticularly true with regard to the patterns we have shown throughout this
book,becausetheyhaveapositiveexpectationiftradedconsistentlywith
soundtradingprinciples,includingmoneymanagement.
One important side note on poor money management: Added to the
obvious loss of financial resources is the emotional stress that is placed
on the trader. This stress can be manifested in the form of depression or
addictive behaviors such as alcoholism or drug abuse. To prevent these
very destructive behaviors from occurring due to lack of proper money
management, traders can set up a structure in their trading to start with
goodhabitssuchasalwaysusingstop-lossorders.
Ifarealbrokerisused,anorderstructurecanbeimplementedsothat
each time a trade is placed a stop-loss order must also be placed or the

Sincetradingisagameofprobabilities,weknowthattherewillbewin-
ning streaks and losing streaks. We do not, however, know in what order
they will play out; then it is only logical to structure the money manage-
ment to allow us to stay in the game long enough to not be blown out of
the game by drawdowns that will occur. This is why it is going to be im-
portant to always commit only a small percentage of capital to any one
tradingidea.
Wesuggestusingariskintherangeof1percentto3percentoftotal

on any particular trade. In the example of the $100,000 trading account,
using a 1 percent risk or $1,000, the trader has to be wrong 100 times in

believe going above the 3 percent risk of your trading capital on any one
trade should ever be implemented. The trade setup may look absolutely
foolproof and the trader may believe that it cannot fail; but it is only one
trade inmany and never worth therisk. There isan old saying intrading:

The call option gives the buyer, or owner, the right—but not the
obligation—to purchase the underlying instrument at a specified price,

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE PRICE
OF AN OPTION
Many things can contribute to and change the price of an option. Since
an option is a derivative of an underlying instrument, its value is directly
tied to that underlying instrument, whether it is a stock, commodity, or
futures index option. Here area few of themain variables that willaffect
theoption’sprice:
Ĺ Thepriceoftheunderlyingstock,commodity,orfuture.
Ĺ The strike price—whether it is in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-
the-money.SeeFigures12.1and12.2forexamplesofallofthese.

The main reason to use options at what may be major or signifi-
cant market turning points is the leverage they offer. Options can be pur-
chased for a set dollar amount that can be a small portion of trading
capital. When a particular market or underlying instrument has a large
moveintheanticipateddirection,optionpricescanincreasedramatically,
giving the option investor a potential large return on a relatively small
investment.

Always use strict money management when trading options, and risk
only a small portion of total trading capital on one option trade. Trading
options can be a profitable strategy when used correctly. You can reduce
market exposure by not trading the stock, commodity, or future outright
through volatile periods. Trading options requires due diligence on the

Ifyoutradelongenough,itisnotamatterofif sometypeofdisaster
will occur, but a matter of when some type of disaster will occur. These
times can either benefit the trader to an extreme or devastate the trader
to an extreme. With any luck, it may be a neutral outcome. Many of the
unexpectedoccurrencescanbedealtwithifthetraderhasthoughtahead
andplannedforthesetypesofincidents.
Many types of professions train intensively for unexpected and rare
occurrences.Almostanyoneinmedicalfieldssuchasdoctors,nurses,and
EMT personnel train for emergencies. Airline pilots and crews are man-
dated by the federal government to have specific annual hours of recur-
rent training to handle every imaginable type of unexpected event. Fire-
fighters, police and specialized units of the police forces, as well as mil-
itary personnel and all of those specialized forces train hour upon hour
to handle stressful on-the-job situations. The approach and reasoning are
really quite simple: If an individual has had the benefit of training, prac-
ticing and rehearsing through drills, then in a situation that is sudden
and likely to cause high stress, fear, or anxiety that individual will be
prepared to act. That is very important; trained individuals keep their
wits about them, do not panic, and are able to act under unexpected,
extremestress.

is our brains’ way of protecting us at times when our systems go through

Training yourself to think and act under excessive pressure is part of
trading. Traders take on uncertainty each day they trade and become ac-
customed to normal trading days and routines. It will be the skilled and
prepared trader who will be able to take action during rarer incidents of
extremeuncertainty.

term, this will help to increase profits and reduce losses when necessary.
Without any type of daily trading plan, it will be almost impossible for a
tradertodeterminewhereareasarethatneedchangingandimprovement.
The time frame each trader works from will determine how often adjust-

evaluateasacostoftheirbusiness;theycanshopforbettercommissions
orconsulttheirbrokerforalowercommissionifnecessary.
As different scenarios arise that fit under the disaster plan category,
traders can make adjustments as to how to handle those situations. They
may experience acondition thatthey find an acceptable way ofhandling,
and should make a note of it for future reference. However, if a situation
arises that they are not prepared for and they need help with solutions,
they can ask other traders how they have handled a similar situation in
the past. It’s very helpful to communicate with other traders and find out
in advance ideas for handling the unexpected. Preparing and planning in
advancewhichactionstotakeinallaspectsoftradingwillkeepthetrader
focused, able to take action, and as calm as possible during both normal

TRADE PREPARATION
Everyone involved in the process of trading should strive to build good
habits. Weaving one strand a day of good habits will eventually build an
unbreakable cable. Someone who takes the time to prepare for trading is
much more likely to succeed than one who spends little or no time and
