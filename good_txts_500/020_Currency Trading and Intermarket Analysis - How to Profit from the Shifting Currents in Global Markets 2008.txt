Gold and

T
he relationship between gold and the dollar has long mirrored the
decades-old battle between real tangible assets and financial assets.
Traditionally the dollar has been the representative currency in any
analysis of gold, due to its sustained role as the world’s reserve currency
andthepreferredmeansofexchangeandinvoicingtransactions.Thecre-
ation of the euro in 1999 and its subsequent ascent as a credible and

theBritisheconomybegantoslumpinthe1880s.
The gold exchange standard ultimately saw its demise in the 1920s
when World War I disrupted trade flows and the free movement of gold.
In 1931, massive gold withdrawals from London banks triggered Britain’s
abandonmentofthegoldstandard,andthreeyearslatertheUnitedStates
introduced the U.S. Gold Reserve Act under President Roosevelt’s New
Deal. The Act reset the value of gold at $35 per ounce from $20.67 per
ounceandendedthelegalownershipofgoldcoinsandbullionbycitizens
forover20years.
END OF BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM
MARKS GOLD’S TAKEOFF
The Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 launched the first system of con-
vertible currencies and fixed exchange rates, requiring participating na-
tionstomaintainthevalueoftheircurrencywithinanarrowmarginagainst
the U.S. dollar and a corresponding gold rate of $35 per gold ounce. But
the U.S. dollar began to lose value in the 1950s and 1960s, due to surging
U.S. capital outflows aimed at Europe’s postwar recovery, as well as an
expanding global supply of U.S. dollars, which made it increasingly diffi-
cultfortheUnitedStatestoconvertdollarsintogoldondemandatafixed

The surge of the Eurodollar market in the late 1960s—where interna-
tionalbanksheldU.S.dollarsoutsidetheUnitedStates—coupledwiththe
escalatingcostsoftheVietnamWarledtotheneardepletionofU.S.gold
reserves and a devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative togold. At the same

with it. In the first half of the 1980s, the dollar index jumped 50 percent
whilegoldtumbledbythesameamounttohitasix-yearlow.
CENTRAL BANKS’ GOLD
SALE AGREEMENTS
In 1997–1999, several central banks from Western Europe sold substan-
tialamountsoftheirgoldinanuncoordinated manner, withtheprincipal
aimofrealizingsubstantialcapitalgainsinthegoldholdingstheyhadpur-
chased several decades earlier. Those gains helped beef up national bud-
getsandstatefinances.The11EuropeannationsthatfirstjoinedtheEuro-
zone had to abide by strict fiscal conditions requiring that budget deficits
not exceed 3 percent of GDP. The gold sales helped erode the value of
the metal by 25 percent between 1995 and 1998, and lifted the U.S. dollar
againsttheJapaneseyenanddeutschemarkby84percentand36percent
respectively.
Central bank gold sales were particularly punishing for the precious
metal in 1999 as both the Bank of England and Swiss National Bank
stepped up their selling. In May 1999, gold’s decline began after the an-
nouncementfromtheUKTreasurythatitplannedtosell415tonsofgold.
Theannouncementtriggeredamassivewaveofproducers’hedgingactiv-
ityandfront-runningspeculation.Amonthlater,theSwissNationalBank
(SNB) decided that gold was no longer an integral part of monetary pol-
icy making and announced the sale of half of its 2,590 tons of gold re-
serves over the next five or six years. The central banks’ announcements
led to a 13 percent fall in gold to $252 per ounce, the lowest level in 20
years.Withoutanysystematiclimitsonvolumeandfrequencyofthesales
and no coordination, central banks were free to dump gold at their own

GOLD-USD INVERSE RELATION
One of the most widely known relationships in currency markets is per-
haps the inverse relation between the U.S. dollar (USD) and the value
of gold. This relationship stems mainly from the fact that gold serves as
an inflation hedge through its metal value, while the U.S. dollar holds its
valueviatheinterestratecommandedbyit.Asthedollar’sexchangevalue
falls, it takes more dollars to buy gold, therefore lifting the value of gold.
Conversely, when thedollar’sexchange valuerises, ittakesfewerdollars
to buy gold, thereby dragging down the dollar price of gold. Unlike cur-

minedbydemandandsupplyaswellastheissuingpowerofcentralbanks

thereforeimmunetoshiftsinmonetaryandcorporatepoliciesandthenew

While gold’s distinction from fiat currencies maintains an inverse re-
lation with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the negative correlation
remains most striking against the U.S. dollar due to the currency’s dom-
inance in central bank currency reserves. Figure 1.1 showed the inverse

Charting gold against different currencies over a three- or six-month pe-
riod enables a truer assessment of individual currencies than comparing
them against the dollar or the euro. This way, traders can not only de-
termine the secular performance of currencies but may also rank them

By exploring the annual growth rates in detail, we note a sensible
explanation to each of the moves. The 25 percent and 37 percent re-
turns in 1999 and 2000 were clearly on the low side of the 82 percent
annual average registered between 1999 and 2007. In those years, gold
was under the dominance of a multiyear bull market in equities founded
on low inflation and steady growth. Such were suitable ingredients for
shutting investors’ appetite in the precious metal. In fact, gold prices fell
6 percent in 2000 against the greenback, concluding a nine-year market.
The following year, 2001, was the first in nearly a decade in which gold
would rise against all of the major eight currencies. This increase was
due to a combination of an ensuing bear market in U.S. and world equi-
ties as well as a general slowdown in the global economy. The Septem-
ber 11 attacks also had a role in lifting gold as investors sought refuge in
its safe-haven status at a time when a major financial center was under
assault.
Gold went on to rally in 2002, before showing a mere 15 percent in-
crease in 2003 and an 8 percent decline in 2004. Since these returns are
an aggregate of gold’s individual performance against several individual

stood at 0.78 over the last four months of the measured period. Nonethe-
less, the average of the NZD’s six-month rolling correlation from January
2002 to June 2008 stood at a mere 0.43. Any close correlation between
the NZD and gold is attributed to the nation’s dependence on dairy prod-
ucts as well as lamb and mutton, which have shown considerable prox-
imity to the trend in gold. But the correlation between the agriculture-

16 CURRENCYTRADINGANDINTERMARKETANALYSIS
DON’T FORGET FALLING
GOLD PRODUCTION
So far, much has been discussed about the financial market underpin-
nings of the rally in gold: falling dollar, falling interest rates, rising
inflation, and investors seeking the safety of the metal during equity mar-
ket sell-offs. But, as is explored in more detail in Chapter 8, the gold
rally has been founded considerably on major supply and demand con-
ditions. These included plummeting world production, rising commercial
demand by wealthier working class populations, and soaring demand for
commodity-basedfunds.
Simply mentioning falling production as a reason is not enough for
addressing factors behind the bull market in gold. Falling production has
resulted from several factors, including chronic underinvestment in the
miningsector;widespreadpowershortagesinChinaandSouthAfrica;pro-
longed strikes and mounting contract negotiations by mine workers de-
mandinghighershareofprofitsfromsurgingmetalsprices;lackofskilled
laborforceaswellasagingpopulationofworkers;andenvironmentalre-
strictionsaddingtoexistingdelays.Worldgoldproductionfellmorethan1

ducingasmuchas1,000tonsofgoldin1970andassumingtheworld’snum-

tion decline for five straight years into 2007. In 2007 alone, South African
productionfell8percentto272tonsofgold,droppingtosecondplacefor
thefirsttimesince1905,accordingtoGFMS.
Falling global oil production was somewhat stabilized by China’s ris-
ing production, where output rose 12 percent to 276 tons of gold in 2007,
accounting for 10 percent of total world production. China went from
producing 71 tons in 1988 to 134 tons in 1998 and to 276 tons in 2007.

in order to gauge their true strength, rather than simply measuring them
against the U.S. dollar or other currencies. Similarly, gold can fulfill the
same purpose for major stock indexes. Instead of measuring the value of
theS&P500orDowJonesIndustrialAverageindexagainsttheU.S.dollar
as is customarily done, we can price it in gold terms. As in the previous

EQUITY-TO-GOLD RATIOS
Therapidriseofgoldrelativetoequitiessincethestartofthedecademay
elicit some skepticism about the durability of the rally and whether the
metalisinthemidstofanexpandingbubble.Havingcomparedthegrowth
ofgoldrelativetoequities,wenowlookatthetwoinrelativetermsbyex-
amining the equity/gold ratio. The ratio compares a commonly used mea-
sure of market value versus a decades-long measure of real asset value.
Gold is known to measure real asset value because of its ability to pre-
servevalueduringinflationarytimes.Sincepriorcharts(Figures1.12and
1.13) have demonstrated a significantly faster growth rate in gold than in
equities,itlogicallyfollowsthattheequity/goldratiohasfallenoffits1999
peak. Figure 1.14 charts the Dow/gold ratio and S&P 500/gold ratio since
1920. Both ratios have fallen more than 200 percent off their 1999 peak,
which occurred when gold hit its 20-year lows and equities reached their
highsatthetopofthedot-combubble.
Notably, since the 1920s, the equity/gold ratio has peaked approxi-
mately every 35 to 40 years: first in the late 1920s, then again in the mid-
1960s, and once more in the late 1990s. Following each of these three
peaks, stocks fell in a multiyear sell-off, accompanied by a rally in gold.

Once having peaked in 2000, stocks headed into a three-year bear mar-
ket before recovering in 2003 and hitting new highs in late 2007. But as
wesawearlier,stocks’2003–2007recoverydidnotpreventtheequity/gold
rally from extending its decline due to the accelerating advances in gold.

of gold remained on the rise, soaring from $750 per ounce to $895 per

FROM A GOLD STANDARD TO AN OIL
STANDARD (1970s–1980s)
The decline in the value of the dollar following the 1971 collapse of the
gold-dollar exchange standard set up in Bretton Woods in 1944 played
a vital role in fueling the upward spiral in oil prices of the first half of
the1970s.
RecallthatduringtheBrettonWoodsperiod,from1944until1971,cen-
tral banks converted their surplus dollars into gold in order to adjust for
tradeimbalanceswiththeirtradepartners.Theconversionsweredoneat
the fixed price of gold of US$35 per ounce. Oil prices, meanwhile, were
mostly stable at about US$3.00 per barrel. But when Richard Nixon shut

As the dollar tumbled in world markets, OPEC suffered from two fronts:
beingpaidinarapidlydepreciatingU.S.dollar,andfacinghighercostsof
itsimportsasworldinflationpusheduppricesforcommoditiesandindus-
trialized goods. The Vietnam War played a key factor in lifting U.S. infla-

5.4percentbeforereachingashighas6.2percentin1970.The47percent
increaseinU.S.priceswasexacerbatedbythedollardeclineattheturnof
thedecade.
No surprise that in early December 1970, the oil cartel began its first
formaldiscussionsaboutpriceincreases,resultingfromchangesinforeign
exchange rates. Inthe threeyears leading tothe1973 oilembargo, OPEC
had made several price increases aimed at offsetting the declining value
of oil receipts from the falling U.S. dollar. At its 1970 annual conference,
OPECpassedaresolutionexpressingconcernabout“worldwideinflation
andtheeverwideninggapexistingbetweenthepricesofcapitalandman-
ufactured goods and those of petroleum.” Price increases were also ac-
companied by allowances for rising inflation. In 1971, 1972, and 1973, oil
producers increased prices by 2.5 percent, 8.5 percent, and 5.7 percent,
respectively.
One cannot assess the inflationary pressures triggering OPEC’s price
hikes in 1971 without addressing the expansive monetary policy pursued
under the Fed Chairmanship of Arthur Burns. After Nixon became presi-
dentin1968,heappointedBurnsasFedChairmanin1970—thesameper-
son who had advised him to cut interest rates prior to the 1960 election
campaign. Burns hadalsoserved asacabinet-rank counselor tothepres-
ident on all economic issues for the year before becoming chairman of
the independent Federal Reserve. Burns’ pump-priming, aimed at ensur-
ing Nixon a second term, catapulted money supply growth to 11 percent
in the summer leading to the 1972 election, four times greater than the
prioryear.Theinflationaryconsequencesofthosepolicieshaveplayedan

The First Dollar Crisis (1977–1979)
The U.S. dollar rebound of the mid-1970s came to a halt in summer 1976.
What followed in the second half of the decade would be a five-year de-
cline in the currency, unprecedented in the new post–gold standard era.
Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaign against Gerald Ford sought to lift
the U.S. economy from its slowdown in the second half of 1976. Carter’s
currencypolicywasfamouslybasedonthetalkingdownoftheU.S.dollar,
especiallythroughhisoutspokenTreasurySecretaryMichaelBlumenthal,
who pressured the Fed into monetary policy easing. The slide was accel-
eratedinJune1977whenBlumenthaltalkeddownthedollarafterameet-
ing with his German and Japanese counterparts. The new policy sent the
dollar tumbling more than 20 percent between January 1977 and October
1978, a dramatic plunge by postwar standards. Figure 2.3 shows how the

dollar tumbled 38 percent against the Japanese yen as Japan’s trade sur-
plus soared on its burgeoning exports industry. Figure 2.4 illustrates the
22percentdeclineintheU.S.dollarindexfromits1976peak.
The dollar crisis was a vociferous manifestation of eroding market
confidence in Carter’s economic policies despite the fact that U.S. inter-
est rates were yielding substantially more than those overseas. While the
UnitedStateshadembarkedonagradualtighteningpolicystartinginearly
1977, Germany and Japan were in the midst of an easing campaign that
lasted well into 1978. From summer 1977 to autumn 1978, U.S. interest
ratesnearlydoubledfrom5.9percentto9.5percent.Incontrast,German
and Japanese rates fell from 4.5 to 3.5 percent and from 5 to 3.5 percent,
respectively,triplingtheyieldadvantageinfavoroftheU.S.dollar.
So why did the dollar damage occur when the U.S. currency had
yielded substantially higher rates than its German and Japanese counter-
parts? The answer lies in Carter’s policy of targeting a 4.9 percent unem-
ployment rate, following the stagflation days of the Ford administration
whereunemploymentbreached9percentandinflationcrossedover11per-
cent. As Carter pursued his unemployment target via major fiscal stimuli,
inflation headed back up and so did the budget deficit—the two bogey-
men of financial markets. Inevitably, confidence in the dollar continued
toerode.

InNovember1978,theUnitedStatesmountedamassivejointinterven-
tionwithGermanyandJapantobuydollarsagainstforeigncurrencies.The
move was supplemented with a 100-basis-point increase in the discount
rate, the biggest in 45 years. The coordinated intervention proved limited
in stabilizing the U.S. dollar. It wasn’t until the Fed rewrote the rules of

thecurrencybegantoturnaround.
Second Oil Shock (1978–1980)
An unusual period of stability in oil prices during the period 1976–1978
proved short-lived. Oil prices had averaged about $12 per barrel partly
due to a firm dollar in 1976 and early 1977, while major industrialized
economiesaveragedannualgrowthratesatabrisk5percentaccompanied
bylower levelsofinflation fromthe1974–1975 period. But the1977–1979
dollar crisis prompted more price hikes from OPEC, which were further
acceleratedbyanincreasinglyunstablepoliticalenvironmentinIran.Surg-
ing social unrest in the second half of 1978 led to heated protests against
theU.S.-backedShahregime,culminatinginthehostagecrisisoftheU.S.

percent between 1981 and 1986, the decline followed a 200 percent price
jump in 1979–1980, which was largely caused by the 20 percent slide in
the dollar. Such a price surge in a relatively short period of time proved
destabilizing for world trade and accelerated global inflation, which was

WORLD INTERVENES AGAINST STRONG

After 10 ineffective attempts of currency intervention aimed at sta-
bilizing the dollar between 1981 and early 1985, the world’s five biggest
economies waged a global coordinated campaign to reverse the dollar’s
ascent. The dollar had already peaked in February 1985 before starting a

Despite the dollar’s 4 percent decline from its February peak to
September, world leaders wanted more. In September 1985 at the Plaza
HotelinNewYork,representativesfromtheGroupofFive(UnitedStates,
Japan,Germany,UnitedKingdom,andFrance)agreedoncoordinatedop-
erations to support non-U.S. dollar currencies. A series of joint interven-
tionstotalingnearly$13billionindollar-sellingoperationsbytheG5over

worked: The dollar lost 20 percent from September to December 1985,

Another main factor weighing on the U.S. dollar was foreign selling
of U.S. equities. As the S&L crisis began to bite into the U.S. economy
in late 1989, non-U.S. investors became net sellers of U.S. equities. The

OIL THRIVES ON WORLD GROWTH,
DOT-COM BOOM (1999–2000)
The U.S. economy remained largely insulated from the Asian crisis, and
the dollar held firm all through 1997–1999. Beginning in 1996, U.S. inter-
estrateswerehigherthanthoseinGermany(andlatertheEurozoneafter
1999) and Japan. Low interestrates and ashrinking budget deficit helped
the economy grow by more than 4 percent in 1997, 1998, and 1999, the

as investors sought higher yields in other currencies. With the Fed funds

were the lowest in the industrialized world with the exception of Japan
and Switzerland. From 2002 to the end of 2004, the U.S. dollar dropped
53 percent against the euro and the Australian dollar, 32 percent against
the British pound, 22 percent against the yen, and 25 percent against the
Canadian dollar. The Fed’s rate hikes of 2004–2005 gave the U.S. dollar a
prolonged reprieve in 2005, before renewed selling eroded the currency’s
valuein2006and2007.

Given that the United States imports 58 percent of the oil it consumes,
the cost implications are considerable, especially given that dependence
on foreign oil has risen from about 36 percent in the first and second oil

THE MAJOR THEORIES
Asmentionedearlier,wewillgiveabriefaccountofthemajortheoriesof
international economics seeking to explain foreign exchange market val-
ues, before tackling the practical underpinnings behind the performance
of each of the nine major currencies. This way, those not familiar with
the theories will be able to reconcile and relate the real-life dynamics
of foreign exchange movements to the theoretical properties, wherever
possible.
Purchasing Power Parity
Thetheoryofpurchasingpowerparity(PPP)statesthatexchangeratesare
determined by deriving relative prices of similar baskets of goods across
differentcurrencies.Changesininflationratesareexpectedtobeoffsetby
equalbutoppositechangesintheexchangerate.
ThemajoradvantageofPPPisthatitprovidesforconvenientandeasy
comparisons when using similar products. However, the theory is valid
only for goods that are easily tradable, with no transaction costs taken
into consideration,suchastariffs,quotas,andtaxes.Infact,PPPisonly
validforgoods,notforservicesorincasesofsignificantdifferencesinval-
ues. One clear disadvantage of PPP is its disregard for market dynamics
such as economic releases, asset markets, sentiment, and the role of po-
litical and geopolitical factors. There was little empirical evidence of the
effectivenessofPPPpriortothe1990s.Thereafter,PPPwasseentohave
worked onlyinthelong term(threetofive years) when prices eventually
correcttowardparity.
Interest Rate Parity
The theory of interest rate parity (IRP) holds that a currency’s appre-
ciation (depreciation) versus another currency in the future must be
neutralized by the interest rate differential. If Eurozone interest rates
exceed their U.S. counterpart, then the euro should depreciate against
the U.S. dollar by the percentage that prevents riskless arbitrage. That
depreciation (appreciation) is reflected into the forward exchange rate
statedtoday.

The U.S. presidential elections of November 2000 also had consid-
erable impact on currency markets, as the victory of Republican candi-
date George W. Bush over Democrat candidate Al Gore was cheered by
U.S. markets due to market-friendly economic policies of the Republi-
can Party. The positive impact on the dollar was especially highlighted
during the several reports that erroneously announced victory for Gore,
whose planned tax hikes were seen as negative for stocks and the cur-
rency. The dollar then rallied strongly during the recount period in mid-

Swiss Franc: +53 percent The Swiss franc proved an unlikely
second-highestperformerin2000,despitelowinterestratesandrelatively
small capital markets. But the highest GDP growth rate in over a decade
and a doubling of interest rates to 3.5 percent stood in the way of carry
trades betting on a weakening and low-yielding franc. Swiss GDP growth
nearly tripled to 3.6 percent, enabling the Swiss National Bank to raise
rates without worrying about restraining growth. The growth story was
alsobolsteredbyrobustneighboringeconomies,suchastheEurozoneand

1.75percentbyyear-end.
Although the Fed funds rate dropped below the overnight rates of all
G7 nations with the exception of Japan, the U.S. dollar outperformed all
currencies in 2001. The rate cuts were insufficient to prevent 21 percent

The Dollar Bear
Awakens
(2002–2007)
T
he 2002–2007 period was a major turning point in global currency
markets, which triggered the start of a new bear market in the U.S.
currency and the reemergence of a broad strengthening in the euro.
The falling value of the dollar brought about a super rally in commod-
ity prices, culminating in new record highs in precious metals, energy
fuels, and agricultural products. This chapter tackles the annual perfor-
manceoftheworld’seightmajorcurrencies(U.S.dollar,euro,yen,British
pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and New Zealand
dollar)between2002and2007.AsinChapter3,theannualperformanceof

2002: THE BEGINNING OF THE DOLLAR
BEAR MARKET
The year 2002 marked the end of the U.S. dollar’s seven-year cyclical ap-
preciation from 1995 to 2001 and ushered in the beginning of a bear cy-
cle, entering its seventh year as of this writing in 2008. U.S. manufactur-
ers stepped up their complaints about an overvalued U.S. dollar eroding
their competitiveness, demanding that President Bush impose tariffs on
U.S.tradingpartnersanddeclaringthatthecurrencyneededtodepreciate
byabout40percent.
Thepresidentheededthosecomplaints,andU.S.Treasuryofficialsbe-
gan adopting a policy of benign neglect, whereby they implicitly wanted

As a result, selling the dollar across the board became the trade of
choice,especiallyamidthesuccessfulconversionoftheeurointoanoblig-

deficitsoaredduetorisingoilimportsandtherelativelylacklustergrowth

Meanwhile, commodity prices rebounded due to the falling value of
the currency in which they were denominated, and partly due to a mod-
est pickup in demand for energy and agriculture products. Metals, how-
ever,didnotshareinthewealthastheworldeconomicgrowthremained
below its potential trend and financial markets extended their erosion
from the heights of 1999–2000. Interestingly, of the eight currencies un-

a green light to sell the dollar, as international trade actions are associ-

Also by spring 2002, the European Central Bank had successfully accom-
plisheditsmissionofensuringthateachofthe13nationsintheEurozone
madeasmoothtransitionintomakingtheeurothelegaltenderinallcom-
mercial and retail transactions in 2002. The ECB allayed public concerns
of notes and coins shortages and worries about the spread of counterfeit
currency.
Initsthirdyearoflife,theeurohadalreadycementeditsroleastheso-
called anti-dollar, reacting to each and every dollar-specific development
andbenefitingfromthedowntrendinthegreenback.Justastheeurosuf-
fered from the dollar’s solid performances in 2000–2001, it exploited the
dollar’swoesquitethoroughly.TheEUR-USDpolaritywasalreadyseenin
1999–2000, but was magnified in 2001 and beyond, as the two currencies
consistentlymovedinoppositedirections.Figure4.4illustratesthepersis-
tently opposing directions between the two currencies, with the dollar’s
outperformance in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2005 being accompanied by neg-
ative euro returns, while the euro’s outperformance in 2002, 2003, 2004,
2006,and2007wasaccompaniedbynegativedollarreturns.
The main reason for the EUR-USD polarity is related to the growth
of trading volumes in the EUR/USD pair. The creation of the euro
meant that the EUR/USD pair eliminated trading in 11 individual cur-
rencypairsagainstthedollar,oneofwhichwasU.S.dollar/deutschemark

turnover in 1995. In 2004, trading in the EUR/USD pair accounted for 28
percent of all transactions, compared to 17 percent and 14 percent for
USD/JPY and GBP/USD. In 2007, the share slipped to 27 percent, but it
remainedclearlythetoptradedpairversus13percentand12percentfor
USD/JPYandGBP/USD.
The euro’s dominance in the U.S. Dollar Index, a futures instrument
tradedattheNewYorkBoardofTrade,alsoexplainsthepolaritybetween
the two currencies. The euro’s weight in the six-currency index is 57.6
percent, followed by the JPY, GBP, CAD, the Swedish krona (SEK), and
CHFat13.6percent,11.9percent,9.1percent,4.2percent,and3.6percent

The other reason for the EUR/USD polarity is the euro’s potential to

One noteworthy development weighing on GBP in late 2002 was that
of geopolitics. As then British Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped up his
support for a U.S.-led attack in Iraq, the UK position began to weigh on
sterling as the market punished currencies whose nations were pursuing
an increasingly isolated pro-war position. Aside from the economic costs
ofaprolongedinvolvementinthewar,participatingcountrieswereatrisk
of reprisal and terrorist attacks on their own soil. In November 2002, the

2003: DOLLAR EXTENDS DAMAGE,

The major differences distinguishing the global economic/market envi-
ronment surrounding the 2003 dollar sell-off from that of 2002 were (1)
thebreadthofthecommodityrally;(2)increasedgeopoliticaluncertainty
weighing on the U.S. dollar and U.S. assets after the outbreak of the Iraq
war; and (3) deteriorating budget deficit and current account deficit bal-
ances.ProlongedinterestratecutsbytheFederalReservetoa45-yearlow

as the Fed vowed to inject the liquidity to allay the risk of deflation. This
readiness to debase the currency via aggressive rate cuts and injection
of liquidity was likened to dropping money from helicopters, a metaphor
that would earn its author, former Fed Board governor Ben Bernanke,
the moniker “Helicopter Ben.” The Fed’s so-called reflationary monetary
policy—boosting liquidity to lift inflation above zero—was a significant
negative for the U.S. dollar and a windfall for commodities as investors
fled the low-yielding currency for the high-growth commodities as these
appreciatedagainsttheirprincipalinvoicingcurrency.

2005,and2006,EURandGBPshowedsimilarmagnitudesintheirreturns
as these currencies were deemed economically interconnected. This was
especially seen via their similar behavior against the U.S. dollar. But the
relationship began to fade in the third quarter of 2002 when the United
Kingdom increasingly supported the tenuous U.S. cause to invade Iraq.
(See Figure 4.8.) Prime Minister Tony Blair drew heightened opposition
from his own party and the majority of electorate. Aside from the issues
of popularity and isolation, Britain subjected itself to the risk of terrorist
attacks by groups staunchly opposed to the war. These risks were later
substantiatedduringtheLondonbombingsofJuly2005.
Aside from geopolitics, the economic reasons for the sterling’s 2003
downfall included an unexpected interest rate cut in February, followed
by a subsequent cut in June to 3.75 percent. The renewed easing from

after 5.2 percent and 3.4 percent, while prices for agricultural raw mate-

Australia’s house price boom began in the mid-1990s, and gathered
speed after the 2000 Olympics with a 20 percent annual increase in some
cities. The peak was reached in mid-2003. As house price growth slowed
markedly, inflation fell from 2.8 percent to 2.3 percent, the lowest since
1999. The interest ratehikes of November and December 2003 helped ac-
celerate the slowdown into the first half of 2004, and caused the central
bank to refrain from raising rates for the first time since 1999, when the
economystruggledfollowingthe1997–1998Asiancrisis.

Afterathree-year slump at thebottom ranking ofcumulative returns, the
U.S. dollar staged a broad comeback in 2005 due to a steady dose of in-

106 CURRENCYTRADINGANDINTERMARKETANALYSIS
New Zealand Dollar: +13 percent
The kiwi’s performance resulted from aggressive rate hikes and soar-
ing dairy prices, which provided a robust growth foundation for the ris-
ing currency. Speculative interest also played a vital role in sustaining
the kiwi’s gains, especially from traders who funded their investments
with low-yielding currencies such as the yen. The Reserve Bank of New
Zealand (RBNZ) raised the official cash rate four times, driving it to 8.25
percent,thehighestlevelsinceitsintroductionin1999.Persistentdemand
strength from Asia was supported by strong growth GDP rates in China
andNIAEsat11.3percentand3.9percentrespectively.Currencystrength

alsomadecommentsabouttheneedforreservediversification. Although
such pronouncements meant that central banks would slow their future
accumulation of U.S. dollars, rather than dump their U.S. reserves, they
triggered various bouts of dollar selling and worsening sentiment for the
currency.
Speculation also emerged that some Arab Gulf nations (United Arab

LESSONS LEARNED
Several lessons can be learned from the currency developments of 1999–
2007.

TheDollarBearAwakens(2002–2007) 109
The most striking pattern prevailing through the eight-year period is
the growing polarity between EUR and USD. As the two currencies dom-
inated trading in global foreign exchange markets, one currency would
persistently act as an opposite for the other. Daily trading averages in
EUR/USDaccountedfor30percentoftotalmarketturnoverin2001,before
retreatingtoward28percentin2004.However,tradinginthecurrencypair
increased42percentto$501billionbetween2001and2004,beforeleaping
67percentto$840billionfrom2004to2007.
On the commodities front, the demonstrable link between global
growth and commodity currencies (AUD, NZD, and CAD) was brought
to the fore at the turn of the new millennium, especially on the heels of
China’s tremendous appetite for commodities. Consequently, foreign ex-
change markets became segmented into a new set of currencies, against
whichlow-yieldingcurrencieswerethefirsttodropduringanysignsofim-
provedglobalgrowthsuchasstrongeconomicdatafromtheUnitedStates
orChina,oranysignsofreducedriskappetite.
Sincethelate1990s,riskappetiteandcarrytradeshavegrowntoform
the single most influencing dynamic in foreign exchange markets since
2005.Thecombinationofthewideninggulfbetweenlow-andhigh-yielding
currencies, and the reduction of fear—as gauged via falling volatility and
rising global equities—had triggered a nearly systematic shift into higher-
yielding currencies at the expense of the low-yielding CHF, JPY, and the
USD.Amongthesethreecurrencies,JPYfaresasthemostconsistentloser
during risk appetite trades—in other words, the accumulation of carry
trades. Conversely, JPY is the main winner out of these three currencies
duringrisingvolatilityandfallingequities.
The multicurrency performances of 1999–2007 have also proven that
interestratedifferentialsdonotalways succeed insolelyinfluencing cur-
rencyvalues.Otherimportantfactorssuchasglobalgrowth,riskaversion,
carry trade unwinding, and the direct relationship between commodities
andtheircurrencieshavehadsignificantweight.Theyear2001provedto
be one of those situations, when the deepening slowdown in the United
Statesandanimpendingcoolingabroadledinvestorstorewardthedollar
duringtheFed’saggressiveeasing.
Capital flows are another reason why interest rate differentials may
not work in driving currencies. In 1999, the lowest-yielding currency, the
yen, was the highest performer among the major eight currencies, while
NZD was the highest-yielding and lowest-performing currency. Escalat-
ing anticipation of an eventual Japanese recovery following the slump of
the 1990s drove asset managers to snap up Japanese stocks, which were
largely deemed to be undervalued. Conversely, a soaring trade deficit in
New Zealand, partly as a result of declining food and agricultural prices,
sentthekiwitothebottomoftheleague.Insuchcaseswheretheinterest

tion took place in 1998–1999 when regional trade was hampered by the
1997–1999 Asian crises. The relationship is particularly robust between
the annual aggregate returns of the aussie and annual GDP growth of
newly industrialized Asian economies. The powerful advance in China’s
GDP growth between 2004 and 2005 proved a vital source of demand for
Australia’s iron ore industry, thus alleviating the fallout from the burst of

Risk Appetite
in the Markets
M
anaging risk has become an increasingly integral part of the
risk/return trade-off in financial markets over the years as partic-
ipantsseektoimprovetheprofitabilityoftheirinvestmentswhile
attempting to reduce their downside. Increasing risk can adopt one of
the following forms: (1) concentrating assets in securities with similar
risk/return attributes; (2) holding securities with the probability of high
rates of return and correspondingly high probability of losing the initial
investment; (3) selecting securities with relatively high volatility or vari-
abilityofreturns;andfinally,(4)borrowingfundswiththeintentionofen-
hancingtherateofreturnattheriskofmagnifyingthepotentialofaloss.
The latter type of investment risk is most relevant to this chapter as
it involves risk appetite in the way funds are raised and where they are
invested. Speculation may be more apt to describe this type of endeavor
duetothehighpotentialoflosingallofone’sinitialcapitalinarelatively

Borrowing money at low interest rates to fund higher-yielding loans has
been the conventional source of revenue for banks for as long as credit

providers have been around. The same principal is also the basis of cur-
rency carry trades, whereby hedge funds, asset managers, or individuals
borrow funds in low-yielding currencies (funding currencies) to convert
and deposit the proceeds in bonds or certificates of deposit in higher-
yielding currencies, aiming to reap the return from the interest rate dif-
ferential. An extra return can be obtained during the appreciation of the
high-yielding currency, while in other cases the currency depreciation is
greater than the interest rate differential, making the carry trade a losing
investment.Thetwocomponentsonwhichcarrytradesrestaretherefore

by borrowing (selling) bonds at short-term interest rates to finance the
purchase of long-term bonds at higher rates. The difference between the
coupon received from the higher-yielding bond and the interest cost paid
on the shorter-term bond is called the carry return. The downside risk
entails an unexpected decline in the price of long-term bonds (and rising
long-terminterestrates),andariseinthepriceofshort-termbonds(falling

This example illustrates that currency carry trades have interest rate
and currency elements. While higher interest rate differentials play a ma-
jor role in spurring interest in carry trades, the potential for currency ap-
preciation or depreciation is also essential in sustaining the viability of
thetrade.
Such a straightforward investment endeavor is the basis of hundreds
of billions of dollars worth of daily carry trades by foreign exchange
dealers, proprietary traders, and hedge fund managers. As these players
aim at reaping the gains from the interest rate differential, they tend to
leverage their positions to magnify their returns from what appears to be
an assured investment. Accumulating over $2.3 trillion in daily turnover,

currency markets thrive on trading volumes among bank dealers, cor-
porate treasuries, and speculators. As participants increasingly exploit
emerging opportunities of widening interest rate differentials, volumes
expand and momentum intensifies, resulting in self-reinforcing trends,

High Interest in Yen’s Low Yield
While both the Japanese yen and Swiss franc are characterized by their
low-yielding status, the Japanese yen is more notorious for its sharp de-
clinesduringtheaccumulationofcarrytradesaswellasforitsrapidgains
during the unwinding of carry trades. This is largely owing to the size of
the Japanese economy, whose GDP of $4.3 trillion is the world’s second
largest, more than 10 times the size of the Swiss economy. More signifi-
cantly, only 1 to 2 percent of Japan’s 1,500 trillion yen (US$14 trillion) in
household financial assets is invested overseas, while the rest is desper-
ately searching for higher yields in an economy with predominantly low
interestrates.

greater than 30 is associated with high volatility resulting from investors’

Phases of increased risk appetite are often accompanied by a rise
in carry trades as improved confidence drives investors to borrow low-
yielding currencies to buy higher-yielding currencies, equities, and com-
modities. Recall earlier in the chapter we addressed the strong positive
correlation between high interest rates and current account deficits. Cur-
rencies of current account deficit countries are said to be riskier and
hencepayhighinterestrates.Conversely,risingriskappetiteiscorrelated
with a decline in low-yielding currencies such as the Japanese yen and
Swissfranc.

Speculators’ Futures Flows
The weekly figures on traders’ futures commitments obtained from the
ChicagoMercantileExchange’sInternationalMonetaryMarketshedvalu-
able light on the developing flows pursuing one currency versus another.
Thedataarebrokendownintocommitmentsbycommercialplayers(usu-
ally made up of businesses aiming to hedge currency risk) and specula-

Considering that excessive yen purchases are a reflection of escalat-
ing risk appetite, one can discern the extent of carry trades via the trend
in the yen shorts—the amount of yen-selling contracts versus the dollar.

yearhighs.Onecouldthenconcludethattheyencarrytradesarereaching
unsustainably high levels, possibly leading the way for someone to build
a contrarian trade to buy the yen. But looking for clues from the VIX and

Speculative futures’ commitments are a fundamental gauge of senti-
ment in currency markets. In the case of the yen and Swiss franc data,
thesereportsofferanimportantpartofthecarrytradepuzzle,particularly
the yen, due to extremely low interest rates. Combining futures flows in

thedrivingforcebehindcurrentsentiment.
High-Yield Corporate Spreads
Anotherwaytogaugetheextentofmarketrisk-takingandcorporatecon-
fidence is via corporate spreads, which measure the difference between
high-yield corporate bonds (also known as junk bonds) and U.S. govern-
ment bonds of similar maturities. The higher the risk faced by a bond is-
suer, the higher the interest rate demanded by holders of the bond. With
U.S.governmentdebtconsideredtobetheleastriskyfromtheperspective
of credit risk (chances of default), yields on government Treasury bonds
(Treasuries)arerelativelylowerthanthoseoncorporatebonds,especially
ascompaniesfacecredit,business,andinflationrisk.
Intimesofrobusteconomicgrowthandlowbusiness/economicrisks,
companiesfacegenerallylowerprobabilityofdefaultingontheirdebtand
incurloweryieldsontheirbonds.
This means that the spread between corporate bond yields over trea-
suries yield is lower as the price of high-yield corporate bonds pushes
higher.Attimesofeconomicuncertaintyandhigherprobabilityofdefault
or late payments, yields are pushed higher to compensate for the risk of
default,andsoisthespreadoverless-riskyTreasurybonds.
Just as a rising VIX tends to reflect increased volatility (fear) in the
general market, rising bond spreads are indicative of emerging worries

ally prevail during periods of healthier economic growth, falling risk, and
increased bond market liquidity. And, similar to the VIX, excessively low
spreads can be a sign of investor complacency and a disregarding of the
risksassociatedwithhigh-yieldbonds.
Thisexplainsthepositivecorrelationbetweencorporatebondspreads
and the VIX index in Figure 5.15. Note how a rising VIX index coincides
with an increase in bond spreads as investors grow risk averse and the
economy slows. Sometimes, market fear escalates and spreads rise while
the macroeconomic fundamentals remain solid. Conversely, falling bond
spreads are the result of rising prices of junk bonds due to increased de-
mandintheextrayieldoftheseriskysecurities.Thisismanifestedinthe
chart between June 2004 and April 2007, a period of advancing U.S. and
globalequities,plentifulliquidity,andboomingmergersandacquisitions.

TYING IT ALL TOGETHER: 1999–2007
When correlating risk appetite to currencies in a real-world scenario, we
findafairlystrongcorrelationbetweenrisingriskaversionandastrength-

YIELD CURVES AND THE ECONOMY
Theyieldcurveisasnapshotofyieldsonbondsofsimilarcreditqualityand

Unlike the coupon interest rate, which is the fixed payment to bondhold-
ers,theyieldtomaturitymeasuresthetotalreturnaninvestorreceivesby
holding the bond until it matures, regardless of whether it pays a coupon
rate. Yield curves are commonly a measure of bonds issued by national
governments, and are therefore almost devoid of business risk. The gov-
ernments of the United States and other countries with robust bond mar-
kets raise funds by issuing bonds with different time durations to banks
andothernationalgovernments.Thesebankswillthenresellthebondsto
other banks, pension funds, hedge funds, various institutional investors,
andindividualinvestors.Thebonds,likeanyotherIOU,promisetopayin-
terestatastatedratethroughoutthelifeofthebond,followedbythefull
principalatmaturity.
The short end of the yield curve represents interest rates on short-
term maturities, ranging from three months to two years. The middle of
the curve includes interest rates on maturities ranging from 3 to 7 years,
while the long end shows interest rates from 10 to 30 years. Since cen-
tral banks control short-term interest rates via changes in the overnight
interest rate, the short end of the yield curve is influenced by the central
bank’smonetarypolicyandmarketexpectationsoffuturepolicy.Monetary
policyisprimarilydrivenbyinterestrateannouncements,openmarketop-
erations(buyingandsellingofgovernmentsecuritiestomanageliquidity),

Risingexpectationsofinflationoranactualincreaseininflationoutstrips
the fixed income of bonds’ coupon payments, thereby reducing the value

releases of stronger than expected economic reports, which increase the
riskofinflation.Conversely,fallinginflationand/orweakeconomicreports
areusuallyfavorableforbondpricesandnegativefortheiryields.
Sincegraphicillustrationsofyieldcurvesarenotalwaysreadilyavail-
able to investors, the shape or steepness of the yield curve can be easily
determinedbythedifferencebetweenselectedshort-andlong-terminter-
est rates. A popular measure is the difference between yields on 10- and
2-yeargovernmentsecurities,knownasthe10-2spread.Inthecaseofthe
United States, another viable measure is the difference between the Fed

TYPES OF YIELD CURVES
Due to the time value of money, bonds with longer maturities pay higher
interestratesthanbondswithshortermaturities.Creditorswillingtolend
funds for longer periods of time will demand higher interest rates than
those willing to lend for shorter durations. As a result, the shape of the

1966and1998.Theexceptions ofthe1950s and1960s maybediscounted
due to the relatively low levels of depth and size of financial markets
50 years ago, and the different mechanism by which the Fed managed
monetary policy at the time. Nonetheless, in each of the aforementioned
inversions, the Federal Reserve was forced to cut interest rates, which is

The relatively low rate of appreciation in long-term interest rates de-
spitetheFed’sratehikesandaggressivetalkagainstinflationwasreferred
to by former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan as a “conundrum” during his
late days in office before his departure in February 2006. Greenspan then
introduced an explanation that was later expounded on by his successor,
ChairmanBenBernanke.Theypostulatedthatthedeclineinlong-termin-
terestratesstemmedfromtheglobalsavingsglutaccumulatedbydevelop-
ing nations as a result of the growing U.S. current account deficit, which
was partly boosted by a deteriorating trade deficit, rising domestic con-
sumption,andnegativesavings.AstheU.S.currentaccountdeficitsoared
from $300 billion in 1999 to over $800 billion in 2006, the imbalance was
increasingly translated into rising surpluses in developing countries. The

surpluses from $15 billion in 1999 to $233 billion in 2006. In the case of
East Asian economies, the hard lessons of the 1997–1998 currency crises
promptedthesenationsintorapidaccumulationofexchangereservesand
a higher rate of savings. Current account surpluses in developing Asia
jumpedfrom$38billionin1999to$278billionin2006.
The bulk of these surpluses were channeled into U.S. and non-U.S.
government securities, to the extent of depressing long-term global inter-
est rates. The average weekly yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes fell
from6.04percentin2000to4.29percentin2005.InGermany,itfellfrom
5.25percentto3.38percent;intheUnitedKingdomitfellfrom5.25percent
to4.42percent;andinCanadaitfellfrom5.81percentto4.07percent.
Bernanke also explained the low interest rates via lower volatility in
capitalmarketscausingholdersoflong-termbondstorequirealowercom-
pensationfortheperceivedrisk.Theotherexplanationforlowerlong-term
rates was the surge in pension funds’ investments in long-term bonds as

Most interestingly, however, when congressmen and reporters asked
Greenspan and Bernanke whether the 2005–2006 flattening of the yield
curvewasaharbingerofeconomicslowdown,theybothrejectedthepos-
sibility, opting to give the aforementioned savings glut explanation. This

1998 Yield Curve Inversion
Startingwiththetopchart,weseehowabriefflatteningintheyieldcurve
in summer 1998 saw the 10-year yield falling toward the level of the Fed
funds rate, ultimately prompting a slowdown in GDP and an 18 percent
declineintheS&P500inthethreemonthsendingOctober1998.
Although no recession ensued in 1998, the emerging market crisis in

causing the collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund,
which had lost nearly $5 billion of client funds. The Federal Reserve cut
theFedfundsratetargetby25bpsinSeptember,October,andNovember,
bringing the rate down to 4.75 percent. The rate cuts were largely ad-
dressed at a sudden plunge in bond market liquidity and deteriorating
global investor confidence, rather than slowing U.S. economic activity.
Nonetheless, the rule of the flat yield curve predicting Fed rate cuts and
fallingstockmarketsdidprevail.

who had borrowed in low-yielding yen to invest the proceeds in higher-
yielding emerging debt—including Russian government paper yielding as
much as 140 percent—were knocked out of their positions when Russia
chosetodefaultinitsdebtandletitscurrencyslide.
2000 Yield Curve Inversion
The next yield curve inversion shown in Figure 6.6 took place in the first
quarter of 2000, when the decline of the 10-year yield was prolonged to-
wardthe6.5percentleveloftheFedfundsrate.Notethatnoperiodofflat
yield curve prevailed prior to the curve inversion as the Fed’s rate hikes
of2000wererelativelymoreabruptthaninothertighteningphaseswhen
rate increases were well communicated. The yield inversion lasted for
11months,beforepromptingtheFederalReservetobeginathree-yeareas-
ingcampaign,cuttingtheFedfundsratefrom6.5percenttoa45-yearlow
of 1 percent. The U.S. economy fell into recession in 2001–2002 and the
majorU.S.stockindexesfellintothelongestpostwarbearmarket,losing
asmuchas75percentwithinthreeyears.
The currency impact of the 2000 yield inversion materialized in late
November 2000 when the Federal Reserve made a 180-degree turn in its
policy bias. At the December meeting, the Federal Open Market Commit-
teeshifteditsoutlookontheeconomyfromthatofstrengthtoweakness,
paving the way for an unscheduled meeting on January 3, 2001, to cut in-
terest rates by 50 bps. The rate cut marked the start of the 2.5-year-long
easingcampaign,whichsentratesfrom6.5percentto1percent.Fromlate
November 2000 to mid-January, the dollar index fell more than 8 percent

Ever since the dollar-gold convertibility was suspended in 1973, each
of the last five U.S. recessions was preceded by 20 to 30 percent declines
inthegold/oilratiofromitsrecenthighs.Althoughthefinancialmediausu-
ally defines a recession as a period of two consecutive quarterly declines
in GDP growth, the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
maintains its definition of recession as a “significant decline in economic
activity.” The NBER uses indicators such as employment, industrial pro-
duction, real income, and retail and wholesale sales. Thus, although the
recessionof2001–2002didnotqualifyunderthedefinitionofback-to-back

becauseGDPgrowthdeclinedinthreeoutoffivequarters.

fuel dragged down the gold/oil ratio from a high of 34.0 in July 1973 to

economieshadfallenintorecession.
The1973–1975recessionwasfollowedbyaperiodofeconomicrecov-

The most cogent conclusion to be drawn from the preceding dynamics is
that a bottoming in the gold/oil ratio has most often accompanied a peak

The other prominent aspect of the relationship is the subsequent growth
slowdown. Recessions were triggered in four out of the five cases, with
the exception of case 3 (fourth quarter 1985) due to the positive growth
implicationsofthe1986oilpricecollapse.
Rather than simply focus on the price of oil and gold separately, in-
vestors ought to follow the interaction of these two important commodi-
ties.Suchinteractionismoreappropriatelymeasuredbythegold/oilratio

ver the past 10 years or so, it has become impossible to discuss
the present or future value of the U.S. dollar without addressing
thedeficitsintheU.S.currentaccount,trade,andbudgetbalances.
Eachoftheseitemsrepresentspartofwhatisknownasthestructuralim-

nomicstatisticstoagraduallythreateningdynamictotheU.S.economy.
The progression of these imbalances has given rise to two opposing
schools of economic thought. One postulates that the U.S. deficits have
been around for most of the past 30 years and that foreign investors will
continue to show faith in the strength of the U.S. economy and its finan-
cial markets by financing these imbalances. The other school of thought
warnsthatforeigninvestorscouldsoonstopfinancingthesedeficits,thus

THE U.S. TWIN DEFICITS
Since 1980, the U.S. economy bore witness to a highly visible set of eco-
nomic imbalances, namely the current account and budget deficits. The

flows are considered international investments, they are recorded in the
financial account of the balance of payments. Thus, while a rising budget
deficit increases the financial account surplus, it also helps to offset the

The falling dollar does not come without its disadvantages. As the
bear market in the currency intensified between 2003 and 2008, so did
the rally in oil prices. With the dollar losing 50 percent against the euro

ADDING THE BUDGET BALANCE
TO THE MIX
Although the correlation between current account deficit and the dollar
hasbeenpredominantlynegative,nodefinitiveconclusionmaybereached
abouttherelationshipbetweenthebudgetdeficitsandthegreenback.The
theorypostulating thatgrowingbudget deficitspush upinterestrateshas
hadamixedrecordintherealworld.
In the late 1990s, Democrats claimed credit for achieving budget
surplus for the first time in three decades, but the resulting decline in
interest rates remained debatable. Interest rates eased in the late 1990s
before recovering due to strengthening economic growth and rising infla-
tionary pressures. Republicans have attributed the disappearance of the
surplustomountingspending relatedtoHomeland Securityandthewars
inAfghanistanandIraq.Theresultingerosioninthefiscalbalancefroma
surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2001 to a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP
in 2004 failed to drive up long-term interest rates. Escalating foreign pur-
chasesofU.S.treasuriesin2002–2006wereinstrumentalinboostingbond

2007,long-terminterestratesremainedpressuredbytraders’expectations
ofaneconomicdownturn.
Whilethecorrelationbetweenthecurrentaccountbalanceandthedol-
lar has been considerably positive, the relationship between the budget
balance and the currency is negligible. Some economists have postulated
a direct relationship between budget deficits and the dollar on the ratio-
nalethatswellingbudgetimbalanceshavefueledupinterestrates,causing
the dollar to gain on higher yields. But the empirical evidence is incon-
clusive. Figure 7.6 shows no lasting correlation over the past 37 years. In
1970–1976,apositivecorrelationbetweenthedeterioratingbudgetdeficit
and the falling dollar emerged, before the relationship broke down in the
remainderofthedecadewhenareductioninthedeficitwasaccompanied
bycontinueddollardeclines.
The correlation turned negative in the first half of the 1980s when
double-digitinterestratesincreasedthedollar’syieldfoundation,propelled
borrowing costs, and lifted the deficit to a record 5.9 percent of GDP.
The relationship remained negative in the second half of the 1980s when
the budget balance and the dollar reversed course. A falling deficit pre-
vailed alongside a tumbling dollar after major economies intervened to
reverse the soaring dollar. Between 1992 and 2002, the substantial tran-
sition from budget deficit to surplus emerged alongside a strengthening
dollar rally as the technology equity boom combined with higher taxes
sent federal finances into the black. The low inflation growth pushed

the economy, thevalue of thedollar has played akey roleindetermining
foreign flows intoU.S. assets. Figure 7.9 shows that thesharp increase in

dollar’sclimbto15-yearhighs.Itismoreplausiblethatsubstantialforeign
inflows intoU.S. assets, such as the 1999–2000 tech bubble, were acause
of dollar strength, rather than an effect of it. But as the dollar began its
prolonged decline in 2002, 2003, and 2004, net foreign holdings formed a
plateau, before lifting 40 percent in 2005 on a one-time dollar rally that
year. As the greenback resumed its decline in 2006 and 2007, net inflows

In order to better discern the changes in foreign direct investment in

perspective. Thus, even though gross U.S. FDI outflows continue to out-
pace inflows, the pace has varied throughout the years. Figure 7.15 illus-

But a major difference from the 1980s or the 1990s is the multiplic-
ity of investment opportunities beyond the United States and Europe.
Oil-rich Gulf states are already earning big dividends from channeling
oil wealth into diversifying their economies into global hubs of financial
services, high tech, and even entertainment. East Asian economies have
used their hard-earned armory of vast currency reserves to further in-
vest mostly at home, but have yet to transform their consumption capac-
ity into a global investment vehicle. Later in this chapter, these emerg-
ing markets’ holdings of individual U.S. securities are broken down by

CURRENCY RESERVE DIVERSIFICATION:
OPEC AND THE MIDDLE EAST
Preserving currency strength is an increasingly vital factor to the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) group of nations as they plan a unified cur-
rency for 2010. A steady foreign exchange rate and price stability are vi-
tal prerequisites to any currency union as they encourage participating
economies to contain inflationary pressures and attain monetary policy
uniformity.Thiswasseeninthelate1970swhenthecurrenciesoftheEuro-

chorcurrencyfortheECUandlatertheeuroasGermany’seconomywas

Bank of England had to maintain the pound at the high exchange rate
of 2.95 deutsche marks per pound. The costs of economic disparity cul-
minated in 1991–1992, when a struggling British economy suffering from
slowing growth and rising unemployment was further stifled by the Bank
of England’s policy of keeping interest rates near Germany’s 10 percent.

In1991,GermanGDPgrew5percentincontrasttoa2percentdeclinein

ulators have been buying local currencies, betting that the central banks
will allow a break away from the dollar peg or a revaluation against it.
Prior to its 2007 decision to depeg its currency from the dollar, the Cen-
tral Bank of Kuwait had faced mounting speculative pressure and was
forced to cut interest rates three times in less than two months to pre-
vent its currency from appreciating as speculators bet that the central
bank would end its peg to the dollar. Inflation surged to 5 percent, well
above its historical average of less than 2 percent. Allowing the currency

but also through the obligation to maintain Kuwaiti interest rates in line

InSaudiArabia,recordinflationrateshadpreventedtheSaudiArabian
Monetary Authority from mimicking the interest rate cuts of the Federal
Reserve, as has been the case over the past 20 years. The other reason
for the reluctance to cut rates is the negative impact on the value of the

The unfolding commodity environment shows no signs of halting the
ensuing dollar damage. On the oil front, the falling currency is at risk of
eroding the dollar-denominated revenues of oil producers, driving even
some of the staunchest U.S. allies this week to consider cutting output.
OPEC has certainly learned from its disastrous decision to raise output
in 1997, which sent prices plunging to 13-year lows at $10 per barrel as
increasedsupplysawlittledemandinthemidstoftheAsianeconomiccri-
sisofthepastdecade.Today’sglobaleconomicslowdownriskstriggering
similar consequences for OPEC, particularly due to the tumbling value of
thedollar.
The potential for OPEC to price oil in a currency other than the dol-
lar is at its closest point of materializing as Arab Gulf oil producers may

peggedcurrencyregimestothebenefitoftheirmutuallyadvantageousar-

occurrencewouldbeakeylandmarkinthedecliningpathoftheU.S.dol-
lar, thereby allowing little choice for global central bankers to further re-
ducetheiraccumulationofdollarsinfavorofeuros,sterling,andevengold.
Several market participants have countered that central bank diver-
sification of dollar reserves would be offset by the expected accumula-
tion of dollar-based assets from commodity-rich sovereign wealth funds
(SWFs).Lastyear,investmentfundsfromtheMiddleEastandtheFarEast
injected nearly half a trillion dollars worth of capital into U.S. corpora-
tions,providingthemwithanessentialsourceoffundinginshakymarket
conditions.
Aside from pressure from Washington, theheftyamounts of U.S. dol-
lardenominatedholdingsinSWFsarethemainreasontotheGulfStates’
reluctance to revalue their currencies against the U.S. dollar. The for-
eign exchange currency loss from any revaluation has been a major ob-
stacle to adjusting these increasingly unsustainable currency regimes. At
the end of the day, the Gulf nations will have to choose between surging
domestic inflation (resulting from pegging to a falling dollar and follow-
ingtheFed’smonetarypolicydespitedoubledigitinflationrates)andthe
currencyhit.
Rising purchases of U.S. corporate stakes will surely extend into the
rest of the decade, exploiting a cheap dollar and fallen prices. But the in-

THE CURRENT COMMODITY CYCLE
VERSUS PREVIOUS CYCLES
Thebroadeningdeclineinthevalueofthedollarcombinedwiththeafore-

up one of the broadest rallies in commodities, encompassing oil, metals,
andmajorfoodcrops.Table8.1showsthattherallyineachofthesecom-
modities groups surpassed the average advances of the past 60 years in
both price and duration. Crude oil and copper started their ascendance
as early as 2001, before being joined by the rest of commodity groups in
2004–2005.

The timing of the current commodities bull market is another dis-

current boom started earlier in the cycle of the global economic and in-

Oil Fueled by Unique Demand and Supply Forces
What makes the latest spikes to record highs in oil prices stand out from
previous rallies is the combination of supply realities and prevailing eco-
nomic climate. Despite the accelerating slowdown in the U.S. economy,

Due to concerns with slowing global oil demand stemming from
the economic slowdown, primarily in the U.S. and other industrialized
economies, OPEC began cutting output by about 350,000 barrels per day
inthefirstquarterof2008.The20percentdeclineintheU.S.dollarduring

The most commonly listed causes of the latest gold bull market
have been the accelerating pace of the dollar’s decline, rising inflation,
and increased jewelry purchases by the rising middle class in emerging
economiessuchasIndia.Jewelrymakesupabout68percentoftheworld’s
gold demand and India is at the top of that list. As in other commodities,
China and India have shown relentless appetite in their demand for gold
and iron ore products. Together they account for 40 percent of global
demand.
Before addressing supply factors, there is one more demand-related
reason behind the surge in gold. Investments and speculation make up
about 11 percent of demand for gold. A relatively novel but powerful
component of such demand has been exchange-traded funds specializing
in gold. These funds allow institutions, hedge funds, pension funds, and
household investors to snap up gold at face values that are as small as a
tenthofthebullionprice.GoldETFshavebeeninstrumentalinmobilizing

COMMODITIES AND THEIR CURRENCIES
Before moving on to a closer look at the various commodities and the
currencies most dependent on them, we take a glance at the correlation
between the U.S. Dollar Index and the various commodities groups since
1980.Figure8.13showsthebiggestnegativecorrelationwiththeU.S.dol-

The geopolitical events of the 1980s, such as the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan—which triggered a $320 jump in gold in less than one
month—were accompanied by equally sharp moves in the currency. The
clear-cutpathschartedbythegreenbackalsohelpedtoexplainthehigher
negative correlations with commodities. The dollar soared 94 percent in
the first half of the decade, before the coordinated interventions of the
Plaza Accord helped drive it back down by 50 percent into the rest of
the decade. In the 1990s, the greater USD negative correlation occurred
with oil, the bulk of which emerged in the second half of the decade as
thestrengtheningU.S.economyandescalatingequitybullmarketboosted
the dollar at the expense of the oil. In 1999, the dollar index surged
to 10-year highs, coinciding with 14-year lows for oil at $12 per bar-
rel and 20-year lows for gold at $253 per ounce. The 2000–2007 corre-
lations for oil and gold were weaker than those in prior decades due
to the fact that the dollar moved in tandem with oil in 2000–2002 and
with gold in 2005. Nonetheless, the price developments in the first five

ENERGY EFFICIENCY NOT ENOUGH TO

Althoughthesurgeinoilpriceshasbeenincreasinglycomparedtothedot-
combubbleandotherdemand-orientedbubbles,thesolidityofthecurrent
rally is characterized by supply-specific dynamics whose existence feeds
priceescalationdespiteanydemandslowdownintheindustrializedworld.
This does not necessarily mean that global oil demand has fallen across
theboard.Chineseappetitehasbeeninstrumentalinfillingtheslackdur-
ingtheeconomicslowdownencounteredintheUnitedStatesandEurope,
takingover9percentoftheworld’sconsumption.Indeed,theInternational
Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the world will need 55 percent more
energy in 2030 than in 2005 in order to meet the projected needs of ris-
ing populations, and 45 percent of that energy demand will emerge from
India and China. This means China’s oil imports will jump fivefold from
its current 3.5 million barrels per day, and India will become the world’s
third-largestnetimporterofoilby2025.

day, with non-OPEC supply increasing by about 800,000 barrels per day.
OPEC’s share of world oil supply is expected to rise from 42 percent in
2007to52percentbytheendof2030.
ThisraisesthequestionastohowOPECoutputwillfillthegap,when
even Saudi Arabia has difficulties surpassing its maximum capacity. The
natural follow-up question is: Why is it in the interest of OPEC to raise

general weakness is factored in, the incentives for OPEC to raise output
becomelesstenable.Indeed,unlikeinthepreviousyearsofhighoilsuch

at the mere mention of the U.S. credit crunch and the falling dollar being
thecauseofprolongedoilstrength.Eachofthesefactorspresentsastark
reality supporting OPEC’s reluctance to bring down prices, regardless of
U.S.demands.
Even if OPEC were able to increase output significantly, the cartel

220 CURRENCYTRADINGANDINTERMARKETANALYSIS
Currency Plays in Gold and Copper
Currency opportunities emerging from gold and copper producers have
long reached far beyond South Africa. The emergence of Australia as a
powerful copper producer has been instrumental in elevating the aussie
amongthemostheavilytradedcurrenciesintheforeignexchangemarket
today. Yet there remain other golden opportunities for currencies in the
metalsarena.
Chilean Peso Chile is the world’s largest exporter of copper, which
makes up nearly 55 percent of its total exports, with overall mining ac-
countingfor8percentofthenation’sGDP.Buttheworld’slargestcopper
producer is also facing energy challenges hitting the mines as prolonged
droughts threaten the required supply of water from hydroelectric reser-
voirs. The demand equation is also bolstered by China’s surging copper
demand, aimed at rebuilding its faltering power grid. China’s power ca-
pacity and relatively thin electricity supplies are giving rise to continued
forecasts estimating widespread shortages to take place by 2009, thereby
reducingregionaloutputincopper,zinc,andaluminummines.
The 358 percent advance in copper between January 2000 and May
2008 is the second-biggest increase in a single commodity class, second
only to the 382 percent increase in oil. Surging copper prices and robust
demand have helped lift Chile’s current account surplus to 4.4 percent
ofGDP.
Australian Dollar Besides an aggressively hawkish monetary policy
from the Reserve Bank of Australia prevailing since 2002, the Australian
dollarhasbeenremarkablyunderpinnedbysoaringcopperandgoldprices.
Australia is the world’s fourth-largest exporter of copper, and a leading
producerofgold,ironore,andaluminum.Itisalsotheworld’ssixth-largest
exporter. The 358 percent increase in copper from January 2000 to May
2008 and the near tripling in wheat have helped the economy avoid the
strains of a soaring aussie, despite its surge to 24-year highs against the
U.S.dollar.
The operational independence of the Reserve Bank of Australia has
alsobroughtaboutaninflation-vigilantcentralbank,pushinginterestrates
to a 12-year high of 7.25 percent in spring 2008. This prompted currency
traders into opening hundreds of millions of dollars in carry trades, buy-
ing the higher-yielding aussie at the expense of the lower-yielding yen,
franc,andU.S.dollar.TheshareoftheAUD/USDpair’stradingvolumeasa

On the oil front, China’s inevitable path to becoming the world’s
biggest oil importer combined with peaking supplies worldwide is an in-
tegral component serving to maintain prices in their upward trajectory.
The growing use of biofuels and increased demand from China and In-
dia ties into the growing demand for corn and other grains, thus bolster-
ing the foundation of higher prices for grains and agricultural products.

future changes in interest rates and the implications for currency and eq-
uity markets. In this section we focus on how to use the yield curve—as
measured by the difference between U.S. 10-year and 2-year yields—in
order to signal or predict the timing of Federal Reserve interest rate
increases.

In January 2006, short-term yields rose above their longer-term coun-
terpart to initiate an 18-month-long yield inversion. As in 1998, the in-
version was accompanied by contradictory market signals from record-
breaking highs in stocks and escalating liquidity. As the housing market
slowdown turned into an outright recession, the repercussions became
increasingly prominent in the economy and the financial markets. Once
again, the Fed was forced to slash interest rates, less than two months

falling 2-year yields relative to their 10-year counterparts. Once the Fed

10-2 yield spread may prove challenging in its use to predict the first rate
hike. But as each of the four examples illustrates, the peak has either oc-
curred in the midst of a period of steady Fed funds rates (April 1993 and
June2003)orhascoincidedwiththebottomingoftheFedfundsrate—in

OnJune3,2008,FedChairmanBenBernankeshookthecurrencymar-

International Monetary Conference in Barcelona, Spain. The topic of the
dollar had long been the purview of the U.S. Treasury since the 1990s,
when then Treasury secretary Robert Rubin shaped the so-called “strong
dollarpolicy.”Butasthecurrencyslippedintoamultiyeardeclinebetween

actions were everything but dollar positive when policy makers engaged
in aggressive easing of monetary policy by sharply slashing interest rates
in two different easing cycles within less than five years. In the afore-
mentioned speech, Bernanke said, “We are attentive to the implications

2.5 million barrels per day. The 10 percent production increase drove up
total world output by 3.1 percent in 1997, the highest annual increase in
10 years. The decision was a result of soaring prices into the second half
of the year, caused by Iraq’s refusal to grant admission to United Nations
weapons inspectors that summer. But the price impact of OPEC’s supply
increasewasacceleratedbyplummetingAsiandemandinthemidstofthe

broadens the overall commodities boom into food and agricultural raw

also contribute to rising prices in the sector. And finally, the resulting in-
crease in metals prices from overall inflation drives the cost of industrial

while the S&P 500 closed at a three-month low, losing 20 percent off its

Here are some of the conclusions drawn from the patterns observed
overthepast38years.(Thecurrentyear,2008,isincludedeventhoughthe

Dollar Performance
Of the 38 years analyzed, 20 years saw negative dollar performance ver-
sus 18 years of positive performance. Seven of the 20 negative years oc-
curred when the White House and Congress were controlled by the same
party.Andinallbut2ofthe20negativedollaryears,thedollardeclinesoc-
curredinseriesofatleasttwoconsecutiveyears.Theyears1990and1998
were the only negative dollar years where the decline was preceded and
followedbyanincreaseinthecurrency.The1990dollardeclineoccurred
duetotherecessioncausedbythesavingsandloanscrisisandsoaringoil
prices resulting from Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. The subsequent Fed rate
cutsdraggedthedollaracrosstheboard.The1998dollardeclineemerged

The impact of U.S. presidential and midterm elections on currency

Stock Market Performance
The stock market’s performance is measured by the S&P 500, which is
a broad and frequently used index for benchmarking fund performance.
Of the 10 years of negative stocks performance, 7 occurred during a
Republican-controlledWhiteHouseversus3underDemocraticcontrol.Of
the28yearsofpositivestockperformance,19occurredduringbipartisan
controlbetweentheWhiteHouseandCongress.
Regarding the relationship between the dollar and stocks, 7 of the 10
negativeyearsforstockscoincidedwithnegativeyearsforthedollarwhen
2008 is included. At time of this writing, the dollar is down 6 percent and
stocks are down 15 percent year-to-date. Fundamentally, the relationship
between stocks and the dollar had been prominently positive during the
early1980sandthesecondhalfofthe1990s.Intheearly1980s,theFed’s
staunchanti-inflationwarunderthecommandofPaulVolckerboostedin-
terest rates toward 20 percent, rendering the dollar an attractive return
onforeigninvestors’funds,whilestocksrecoveredasinflationwasdamp-

ties attracted persistent growth in foreign capital flows while European

Economic Performance
The criteria used to determine whether the economy fell in a recession
in a given year is the number of quarters showing negative GDP growth.
The years 1973, 1974, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 2001 each showed two quar-
tersofnegativegrowth,thoughnotnecessarilyconsecutivequarters;1990
and 2000 were also recession years even though they had only one nega-

companies. The Act sent the number of foreign cross-listings relative to
new domestic listings to their lowest level in 16 years.1 Non-U.S. compa-

foreign companies allows U.S. institutional and individual investors to di-

companies to delist from U.S. exchanges as the costs of compliance out-

weakness. This 35-year pattern broke in 2005–2008 as former Goldman
Sachs CEO Hank Paulson led the Treasury during protracted dollar
declines.
The underlying rationale is that secretaries with a background other
thanbankinghavegenerallypreferredaweakerdollarinordertoboostthe
priorities of U.S. exports, domestic industry, and employment. Treasury
secretariesfromthefinancialservicesindustryhaveservedduringperiods
ofgeneraldollarstrength,inlinewithWallStreet’sprioritytodrawforeign
capital toward U.S. financial assets and exchanges. Naturally, the perfor-
mance of the dollar has largely been a function of U.S. economic growth
andinterestratesrelativetothemajoreconomies.Buttheaforementioned

The Breaking of a Pattern
Yet, just as prominent as the relationship between U.S. Treasury secre-
tariesandthevalueofthedollarhasproventobeoverthepast40years,so
has the break in the relationship during the term of Secretary Hank Paul-
son,aformerCEOofGoldmanSachs,arguablytheworld’smostsuccess-
fulinvestmentbank.FromhisnominationonMay2006totheendofJune
2008, Mr. Paulson served during one of the worst two-year periods in the
historyofthedollar,whichfell15percentintrade-weightedterms,24per-
centagainsttheeuro,and18percentagainsttheyen.
Paulson’s nomination coincided with the end of the Fed’s two-year
tighteningcampaignandtheemergenceofararedivergencebetweenthe
monetarypoliciesandgrowthratesoftheUnitedStatesandmajorindus-
trialized nations. Those cyclical problems have compounded the damage
in the dollar due to a prolonged slowdown in the U.S. economy, which
was accompanied by deepening erosion in the capital structure of U.S.
banks and continued instability in the overall financial system. Such are
theprominentdynamicsinthecurrentforeignexchangemarketthatthey
trigger the break in multidecade-long patterns, whether the relationship
between the currency and the background of U.S. Treasury chiefs, or the

italandtradeflowsfromtherepercussionsofaU.S.recession.
Earlier in this chapter we addressed the advantages for the United
States and the rest of the world to be gained from attaining stability in
the value of the dollar. As long as the greenback remains the world’s re-
serve currency used for invoicing oil and other major commodities, sta-
bilizing its value is paramount in averting a global inflationary spiral at a
time of slowing world growth. Failure to secure a soft landing in the U.S.
dollarcouldlandtheworldeconomyinprotractedsupplyandinflationary
shocks, while dealing renewed corrosion in U.S. financial markets as the
world loses confidence in the currency. When President Bush appointed
Mr. Paulson at the helm of the U.S. Treasury in May 2006, his main prior-
itiesconsisted ofbolsteringconfidence intheU.S.economy andfinancial
marketsviapreservingthetaxcutsbeyond2010,expandingaccessforU.S.
businessesinChina,andpushingBeijingtobringaboutfasterappreciation

ingtheworld’sconfidenceinit.ButnotevenMr.Paulsoncouldavoidthe
currency impact of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate cuts resulting from
whatisincreasinglybecomingthemostpenetratingcreditcrisisofthelast

This chapter has revisited a few themes already tackled throughout
the book, while turning to a new page concerning the role of U.S. poli-
ticsinshapingthelong-termdynamicsofthedollarandtheU.S.economy.

dollar has fallen below parity against the Swiss franc and Canadian dol-

for the first time in history. Nor is it a matter of chance that the secular
