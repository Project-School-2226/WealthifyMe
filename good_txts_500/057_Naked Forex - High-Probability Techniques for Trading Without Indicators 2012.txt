the focus is on the indicator, rather than price action. Indicators become
the scapegoat for losing streaks and often keep losing traders in a hold-

indicatorsfromthebeginning.
Myth 2: Successful trading must be complex. The second part of this
book is about naked trading systems. These systems are incredibly sim-

how you may both identify and change your thinking, because this is the
real driving factor in your trading success.
Many readers will continue to hold onto these myths. In fact, some
readers (those who believe trading success depends on the trading system)
will simply read the second section and begin trading the naked trading
systems. This is unfortunate. The first section is critical because it offers
reasons for price action trading (a new belief system) and a course of ac-
tion for becoming an expert at naked trading (new trading habits). The
third section is where breakeven and slightly profitable traders will learn
to move into the realm of the true professional trader. All sections of the
book are important, and it is my hope that by reading it you will find simple
methods for extracting profits from the market.
You can trade successfully without indicators. For many traders,
naked trading is both refreshing and easy to apply. You can trade success-
fully with simple trading systems. Simple systems are robust and powerful.
However, ultimately, your success as a trader will depend, not on the trad-
ing system, but on how you incorporate your beliefs and attitudes about
risk into your trading routine. I hope this book will aid you in your journey
totradingsuccess.
I also hope that you keep in touch by stopping by the compan-
ion web site for this book, complete with live market trades, additional
tools, and new naked trading systems. You will find this on the Web at
www.fxjake.com/book.

The
Fundamentals of
Forex Trading
Gregory:“Drawthytool...”

—Shakespeare,RomeoandJuliet
Welcome to the world of forex trading. Forex is the largest market
in the world. Forex traders exchange $4 trillion each day, but is
forex the best market for you? The answer depends on what you
are looking for. If you want a market that never sleeps, if you want the
opportunity to trade at any time of the day, if you would like to make a
boatload of money in a short amount of time, forex may be for you (it
shouldbenotedthatyoumayalsoloseanincredibleamountofmoneyin

reasons to become a forex trader, but before jumping into the reasons,

A QUICK LESSON IN CURRENCIES
“Forex” is simply an abbreviation for “foreign exchange.” All foreign ex-
changetransactionsinvolvetwocurrencies.Ifanindividualtrader,abank,
a government, a corporation, or a tourist in a Hawaiian print shirt on
a tropical island decides to exchange one currency for another, a forex
trade takes place. In every instance, one currency is being bought and,

simultaneously, another currency is being sold. Currencies must be com-
paredtosomethingelseinordertoestablishvalue;thisiswhyforextrading
involvestwocurrencies.
If you and I go to the beach and I tell you the tide is low right now,
how do you know this is true? You may decide to compare the current
water level to the pier. If there are starfish and mussels exposed on the
pier,youmaybelievemebecauseyoucancomparethecurrentwaterlevel
to the previous water level. In forex, we compare currencies in much the
sameway,currenciesaretradedinpairsand,thus,onecurrencyisalways
comparedtoanothercurrency.
Anexamplemaybehelpfultoillustratehowcurrenciesaretraded.If
youareahotshotforextrader,andyoubelievethattheEUR/USDisgoing
to go up, you may decide to buy the EUR/USD. Thus, you think that the
Euro currency will get stronger, and the U.S. dollar will weaken. You are
buying the EUR/USD currency pair, another way to look at this is to say
you are buying Euros and simultaneously selling U.S. dollars. The unique
(andoftendifficulttounderstand)aspectofforextradingtokeepinmind
isthis:Eachforextransactioninvolvesthebuyingofonecurrencypairand
simultaneouslythesellingofanothercurrencypair.
Ifyouhaveexperiencebuyingorsellinginanymarket—thestockmar-
ket,afuturesmarket,anoptionsmarket,thebaseballcardmarket,orthe

thing.Theforexmarketissimplyamoneymarket,theplacewherespecula-
torsexchangeonecurrencyforanother.Inmanyways,theforexmarketis
no different from the stock market. The major differences between forex
and the stock market are as follows: A forex transaction involves buying
one currency pair and selling another, also, the symbols to identify forex
pairs are consistent and systematic, unlike the symbols used to identify
companieslistedonastockexchange.
Forex traders buy and sell countries. It is true: Forex traders are ba-
sically buying “shares” in a country, just as a stock trader buys shares
in a company. For example, if forex trader Emma decides to sell the
EUR/USD, she is essentially selling the European Union (and buying the
UnitedStates).Tobeevenmorespecific,wemightsuggestEmmaisbuying
theeconomyoftheUnitedStates,andsellingtheeconomyoftheEuropean

Itmaysoundsurprising,butitistrue.Ifyoustartmakingmoneytrad-
ingforexoverseveralmonths,youwilljointhewinners.Yourretailforex
broker will begin to hedge your trades. In other words, if you are in the
winner group, your retail forex broker will take trades in the real forex
market,theinterbankmarket,tooffsettheprofitsaccumulatedbythewin-

cause your broker takes the other side of your forex trade. Although it is
truethatsomeretailforexbrokersmatchuptradeorderssothatatrader
with a buy trade order is paired up with a trader with a sell trade. How-
ever, the overwhelming majority of retail forex brokers do not do this.
Unless you are a consistently winning trader, your broker will take the
risk on your trades, and assume that your trades will lose money in the
long run. This is not something that is widely discussed, but it is true.

personality. The first school is the school of fundamental analysis. Fun-
damental traders use economic reports and news reports as the basis for
their trading decisions. Forex traders who have a fundamental approach
will closely examine world events, interest-rate decisions, and political
news.Fundamentaltradersareconcernedwithproperlyinterpretingnews,
whereasthefocusforthetechnicalforextraderisquitedifferent.
Thetechnicalforextraderusestechnicalindicators(or“indicators”)to

a technical, indicator-based approach will examine the price charts. So,
while the fundamental forex trader is concerned with interpreting news

onachart.
What are technical indicators? Indicators are simply another way
of looking at a market price. In much the same way that it is possible
to examine the speed of a car in many different ways, it is possible to
examine price charts in many different ways, with indicators. Just for a

WHAT IS NAKED FOREX?
It can be very confusing for the novice trader, and this is one reason
why naked trading, trading without indicators, can be liberating. When
starting out, many traders focus on the indicator. This is completely
understandablesincenearly90percentoftheforextradingbooks,thevast
majority of forex sites on the Internet, and forex trading seminars focus
onindicatorsandindicator-basedtrading.
Indicators encourage “secondary thinking,” which is a real handicap
fortraderslookingtoacquireexpertise.Secondarythinkinginvolvesana-
lyzing the indicator, spending time considering where the indicator may
go,ratherthanfocusingonthemarket.Nakedtraders,bydefinition,focus
onthemarket,whichisverydifferent.

Tighter stops mean more money. The naked trader and the MACD trader
could have both exited at the same price, but the naked trader captures
more profits because the stop loss is placed closer to the entry price.
The money-management section of this book will have more information
on how naked trading strategies enable traders to make more money
simply because naked signals appear earlier than indicator-based trading
signals.
The MACD and the RSI are not the only indicators that lag. All
indicators lag. The stochastic is a popular indicator used to time trades
accordingtothenaturalrhythmsofthemarket.Onetraditionalstochastic
trading method is similar to the RSI strategy. A sell signal is indicated
when the stochastic falls below the 30 level and then crosses higher (see
Figure2.5).

A “pip” is a percentage in point. One pip is equal to 1/100th of 1 percent.
It has traditionally marked the smallest move a forex pair can make. Forex

characteristic indicator lag associated with the stochastic means that the
stochastic trader not only enters a losing trade, but immediately after
the stochastic signal the market trades in the wrong direction, and the
trade enters into a protracted drawdown. In fact, it is unlikely that the
stochastic trader ever had profit on this trade. Naked-trading strategies
enable the trader to enter a trade based on current market price action,
and often avoid the severe drawdowns associated with indicator-based
trading.
Most traders believe severe drawdowns are a part of trading. This is
simply not true. Severe drawdowns are characteristic of mistimed en-

TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR LOSING TRADES
All traders experience drawdowns. All traders experience losing trades.
However, naked traders take responsibility for losing trades. Indicator-
based traders often blame their indicators for unsuccessful trades (e.g.,
“the MACD looked like it was going to cross here,” “my indicator did not
load correctly,” “maybe I should change the settings on my indicator be-
causethemarkethasbeenchoppylately,”“thatmovingaveragecrossover
wasafakeout—whipsawedonthatone,”etc.),butthenakedtraderdoes
not have this excuse. There is no scapegoat when you are using market
data(priceaction)totaketrades.Tradingwithpriceaction,thatis,theac-
tualpriceonthechartasthebasisforalltradingdecisions,meansthatthe
naked trader has no excuse for losing trades. This is extremely liberating
formanytraders.
The indicator-based trader also has the added advantage of an indi-
cator to blame when things go awry; the naked trader can blame no one
but the market for losing trades. This is a subtle but very important dif-
ferencepointofreferenceforthenakedtrader.Alltradinginvolvesanas-
pect of luck. All traders experience a lucky streak of winning trades and

In fact, for many naked traders, the current market price is a bit like a
biofeedbackmachine.Icertainlylookatthemarketpriceasbiofeedback.
A biofeedback machine will allow you to tune into the physiological
changes in your body, in the hopes that you can better control your
physiology. For example, if I am an anxious person, and I am always
sufferingfromstress,Icanhookmyselfuptoabiofeedbackmachine.The
machinewillalertmeifIbecomeanxious(bloodpressureincreases,heart
rate increases, etc. would cause the machine to produce the sound) by
soundingoffanalert.Icanthenpayattentiontothesoundsofthemachine
anduserelaxationtechniquestodecreasemyanxiety.Themachinesimply
alerts me when I need to recalibrate my physiology. Over time, I should
be able to wean myself off of the biofeedback machine and reduce my
anxietyonmyown,withouttheaidofthebiofeedbackalerts.
LEARNING FROM MARKET
BIOFEEDBACKTM
Itmayseem strange, butyou willeventually be abletodo thesame thing
withyourtradesifyoudecidetoadoptnaked-tradingstrategies.Inthebe-
ginning, the market price is your biofeedback machine. If the market is
going in the wrong direction, you have valuable feedback on your trade.
Learn from this. Was the entry too early? (Most traders I know are much
more likely to jump into a trade too early than to wait too late.) Was the
entry too late? The market will tell you how your trade rates. Why is it
important to pay attention to the market biofeedback? Because you will
learn more from Market Biofeedback than you will learn from any guru,
anytradingbook,oranyonlinecourse.Anotherwaytostatethisisasfol-

A psychological, behavioral, and trading response to the market price after a

Market Biofeedback involves two distinct domains, The first is how

what you should learn, from your trading experiences. You should learn

also learn from your reaction to the market after you enter a trade. Even
if you do not consciously intend to learn from Market Biofeedback, it is
importantforyoutorecognizethatMarketBiofeedbackwillyieldallyour
important trading decisions. How you approach your trading, which trad-
ingsystemsyouemploy,whetheryougiveuponyourtradingorgoonto
a long and successful trading career, all these things are determined by
MarketBiofeedback.
Most traders allow Market Biofeedback to completely dictate their
tradingapproach,even without realizingthisishappening.Forexample,

the difference between the traders who give up on a trading system and
lookforanewstrategyandthosetraderswhomaintainconfidencedespite

How you react and respond to a drawdown, to a windfall of pips,
or something in between is exceptionally valuable information. The eas-
iest way to see Market Biofeedback is to record your thoughts as you
trade. You can record your voice before, during, and after a trade. You
can take screenshots of the trade before, during, and after. You may also
recordvideoofthetradebefore,during,andafterwithadesktop-computer

Here are the important questions to answer as you record Market

personal Market Biofeedback—an invaluable tool. More importantly, you
will bring into conscious awareness how you react to the market. Most
traders will trade their whole lives without recognizing that Market
Biofeedback dictates how they adapt and change as a trader. By simply
acknowledging Market Biofeedback, you can understand how you react to
the market in general, and how your trades, in particular, mold your ap-
proach to trading. Market Biofeedback is the one area that most traders
neglect, most traders are not quite aware of this process. By paying atten-
tion to Market Biofeedback over time, you will be able to become aware of,
and eventually control your trading behaviors. This will allow you to take
abigsteptowardsconsistentprofits.

associated with testing trading systems on historical data; however, the
consequences associated with trading a system in live market conditions
whenitisnottestedonhistoricaldataaremuchmoreproblematic.
THREE GOALS OF BACK-TESTING
Your back-testing will allow you to do two things: First, you will identify
how suitable the trading system is for you. This does not mean you are
discovering whether the trading system is profitable, but, rather, you are
examining the fit between you, the trader, and the rules of your trading
system. Second, you will learn to trust your trading system and learn to
let go of your trades. You may trade in a more relaxed manner once you
havetakenthousandsoftradesoveryearsofmarketdata.Theconfidence
gained by trading your system repeatedly will show up in the form of a
relaxed approach to your live trading. Third, you will gain expertise with
your trading system. This may only happen if you take many trades, and

that make sense to me. I am better at extracting profits from the longer-

You Are the Expert
The number-one reason traders fail in forex is this: Most traders do not
have expertise. Most traders begin trading a system without much expe-
rience trading a system. When the first bump in the road appears (e.g. an
extended losing period, a lack of signals for a week, a couple of difficult-
to-interpretsignals,etc.)thesystemisabandoned.Thetraderswhoconsis-

thousands oftrades, you willquickly achieve expertise withyour system.
Seriouslytestingyoursystemmeansmakingtradesjustasyouwouldwith
your live account: trading from the right-hand edge of the chart, without
the benefit of hindsight bias, using a strict application of your trading
rules.
The naked trader has an advantage over traders who trade “normal,”
indicator-based systems. A trader who is trading a system incorporating
seven indicators must view and interpret all seven indicators for each
trade, before, during, and after every signal is initiated. This is cumber-
some and slow. The naked trader has a chart with no indicators, a very
clean chart. These charts are easy to interpret. In fact, the naked trader

Back-TestingYourSystem 33
Even if you only take trades during testing by advancing the chart one
candlestick at a time, hindsight bias may still sneak into your testing. If you
are testing historical data on the EUR/USD in 2008, and you had experience
trading in 2008, you may have a problem. Your subconscious may be pulling
up the 2008 EUR/USD chart and you are obviously not even aware of it. To
fight hindsight bias, take trades on the right-hand edge of the chart, do not
go forward on the chart and then reverse back, and if you do accidentally
go forward, resign yourself to skipping over any signals that pop up and
stick to trading on the right-hand edge of the chart.
USING BACK-TESTING SOFTWARE
Back-testing software is a step up from manual back-testing. Most forex
traders are not even aware of the fact that manually back-testing your
trading system is possible. Back-testing software is an underappreciated
tool, one that will allow you to manually back-test your trading system at
an aggressive pace. Manual back-testing software records your trades for
you and enables you to quickly take trades as you advance the historical
charts. In many ways, manual back-testing with software is not much dif-
ferent from manual back-testing. The advantages to using software are as
follows: Software will allow faster testing, so you may accumulate experi-
ence quicker; the software will do the recordkeeping for you and allow you
to concentrate on the trade signals; you may easily export your data for
analysis; and software discourages cheating— manual back-testing soft-
ware is a hindsight bias killer.
Of the many manual back-testing software packages available, my fa-
vorite is Forex Tester. Forex Tester is a manual back-testing software
package that will allow you to import any data. You may decide to import
forex data, futures data, stock data—any data will work. Forex tester will
record your trades and allow you to export your trading data into a spread-
sheet, after you have completed your testing, for analysis. The beauty of
software-basedtestingisthatitallowsyoutoconcentrateontradingyour
system.Inmanyways,itmirrorslivetradingwithanaccountplatform.If

There are many traders, myself included, who will spend more time
back-testing with software because it is much easier than manual back-
testing.Back-testingwithsoftwarehelpstradersgainyearsoftradingexpe-

Your back-testing data will help you determine your trading patterns
(Doyoufindprofitsmoreeasilyonthedailycharts?Aremostofyourwin-
ning trades initiated during the European session? Do you trade particu-
larly well with your system on the CAD/JPY?), and this can lead to more
fruitful back-testing sessions. You will also know, after back-testing your
system over several hundred trades, if the system makes money for you.

namely hindsight bias. Manual back-testing software makes it easier to
avoid hindsight bias, but you still must be careful to only take trades if

back-testing; your goal is to generate realistic trade results during your

discretionary trading most traders engage in. There are many reasons for

There may be too much human interpretation in the trading system.
Automated back-testing does not allow for the human interpretation

Itisimpossibletoautomatethetradingsystem(fuzzylogic,parameters
difficulttodefine,etc.).
(cid:2)
You may not be able to articulate your trading system. Automated
back-testing is only possible for trading systems with clearly defined
rules.
Mostforextradersshouldnotuseautomatedback-testing.Automated
back-testing is appropriate for those traders who use automated trading
systems. Automated trading systems, known as trading robots, or expert
advisors,arepopularwithforextraders.However,mosttradersaremore
comfortable with discretionary trading systems. So, while it may be pos-
sible to use automated back-testing, it may not be appropriate for most
traders.
Here is a test to help you decide whether automated back-testing is
foryou.Ifyouturnonyourautomatedtradingsystemandcanallowitto
tradewithoutanyofyourinterventionforamonth,thenautomatedback-
testingmaybeforyou.Ifyoursystemneedsyourinputforanyreason,then
youareadiscretionarytrader,andyoushouldusemanualback-testingor
manualback-testingwithsoftware.
There are other disadvantages to automated back-testing. It does not
allow you to gain experience with the trading system. You will not gain
the expertise that you would if you manually tested the system because
the computer takes all of the trades over the course of the back-testing.
Automated back-testing will not give you experience trading your system
through many market conditions. Automated back-testing will probably
nothighlighttheweaknessesofyourtradingsystem;theseweaknesseswill
bereadilyapparentwhenmanualback-testingisdone.However,withau-
tomated back-testing, the weaknesses are a bit more difficult to identify.
Inshort,automatedback-testingisreallyonlyanoptionforthosetraders
whoarenotusingadiscretionarytradingsystem.
Thereareuniquepitfallsassociatedwithautomatedback-testing.For
example, it is quite easy to use too many variables in an automated trad-
ingsystem.Usingtoomanyvariablesoftenimpliesthattherearetoomany
indicators in the trading system. Seasoned traders understand how sim-

mosttooeasyforatradertodecidetoaddmoreconditionsandindicators

system over the course of the historical data in the back-test, often mak-
ing the system look very good. However, these results often completely
fallapartafteryouapplythisverysametradingsystemtoadifferentdata
set or to future market conditions. In a very real sense, the Achilles heel
of automated back-testing is that it is too easy. Because the automated
back-testscanbegeneratedsoquickly,theautomatedback-testerwillgo
overboard tweaking and testing the system. The end result is often a sys-
tem that works exceptionally well on the historical data in the back-test
butfallsapartcompletelyinlivemarketconditions.
There is another issue that often comes up with automated back-
testing. This is the postdictive error, a fancy way of saying that a trading
systemusesfutureinformationtomakeadecisioninthepresenttime.This
is actually something that is related to the hindsight bias. Traders back-
testingautomatedtradingsystemsmustbeextremelycareful.Itispossible
for the back-tester to pull data from the future without knowing about it.
This is obviously a very big problem, because as a rule, future data is not
generallyavailable,despiteanyclaimstothecontrarybytechnicalindica-
tor salespeople (psychics and palm readers are the obvious exceptions).
When future data is used in an automated back-test, the system looks in-
credible,butoncethetradingsystemisappliedtorealmarketconditions,
withoutthecritical(future)data,thesystemfallsapart.
There is one advantage to automated back-testing, that is, it allows
youtoquicklydeterminewhetheranautomatedtradingstrategyisviable.
The back-test may be done in seconds, which is a true advantage for the
automatedtrader.Remember,theautomatedtraderwillnotgainthesame
expertise and comfort level as the trader who uses manual back-testing.
Thisisthebiggestweaknessofautomatedback-testing,theback-testsare
cheap. There is no experience gained each time a back-test is run. The
manualback-testingtraderaccumulatesexperienceeverytimeatradeset-
up is executed. This experience should not be discounted. An automated
back-testmayclarifytheworthinessofanautomatedtradingsystem,often
involving hundreds, or thousands of trades, but remember the trades are
all taken by computer and will not lead to trader expertise. In this sense
the trades are wasted, the trader does not accumulate experience during
theback-testing,thisisonlypossiblewithmanualback-testing.
Ifyouuseautomatedtradingsystems,then,perhaps,automatedback-
testingisappropriate,butifyouusemanualtradingsystems,itmaybebest

were developed by working with traders just like you, around the world.
The key is to approach your back-testing as you would any skill you are
working toward. If you were looking to learn the bass guitar, you would

mated trader, then use automated back-testing; if you are a discretionary
trader,usemanualback-testing.Themostimportantthinginback-testing

youaredoingmanualback-testing.Trytokeepyoursessionsshort—under
twohours—sothatyouapproacheachsessionwithafreshmindandyou
are unlikely to get sloppy. Back-testing for six or more hours will usually
lead to poor results simply because you were not as sharp for your last
tradesasyouwereforyourfirsttrades.
Mistakes Are Part of Back-Testing
Making mistakes is also part of the learning process. We have a natural
tendency to avoid mistakes. So when a trading mistake pops up several
times, it is tempting to modify the trading system so that it accounts for
thismistake.However,thisistheroadthatleadstotoomanyvariablesin

A sweet spot on the chart is a support and resistance zone. You may
be familiar with the concept of support and resistance, however, support
and resistance zones are different from what many traders characterize
as support and resistance. I will call these support and resistance zones
by one word— zones. The eight important characteristics of zones are as

in the past is critical for the naked trader, not because the naked trader
assumes the market will turn around again, but because the naked trader
is on high alert, and the market may turn around again. Some traders are

Use a Higher Timeframe Chart
Question: When you meet someone new, how do you decide what they
are like? You learn their history, you ask people about them, you try and
decipher what they have done in the past, in the hopes of understanding
thembetter.Whydoyoudothis?Theimplicitassumptionisthattheywill
do the same things they have done in the past in the future. Markets are
nodifferent.Whenthemarketisonarunawayuptrend,traderslooktothe
older charts to see where the critical zones are on the chart. This is also
whereweseehistoryrepeatitself,overandoverandoveragain.
This shortcut for finding zones on the chart will work regardless of
the timeframe you are trading. Simply move up one timeframe. This is a
very powerful method for finding the most important zones on the chart.
Examiningthehighertimeframechartwillenableyoutoidentifyzonesthat
will be the most critical areas on the chart for the timeframe you choose
to trade. A few touches on the higher timeframe chart will translate into
many touches on the lower timeframe chart. This technique will work on
anytimeframechart.
TakealookatFigure4.7,theGBP/USDone-hourchart.Thispairhas
madeanextremelowatthe1.6291level.Thistouchat1.6291suggeststhe
market has made a significant low, and this level may become important
later. You may recall that extreme touches (lows or highs) are also criti-
cal zones. Although most zones will have touches from above and below
(support and resistance touches), touches at extreme levels are also very
critical,suchastheextremelowinFigure4.7.Later,themarketwilloften
comebacktotheseextremelevels.

very interesting conclusions. First, the market has indeed found support

This brings up an important point about zones. The importance of a
zone is directly related to the number of touches on that zone. So, for in-
stance, if a daily chart shows a zone with five touches over the past year,
this would indicate a very critical zone on that particular chart. Here is

to see on the four-hour chart, is now easier to see because the touches

FIVE TIPS FOR FINDING ZONES
First, you may not know where to find your zones (see Figure 4.21). If
you are having difficulty identifying the zones on your chart, the easiest

solution is to simply load a line chart. The line chart will show all the
zones, because the zones will be identified by the bends in the line (see
Figure4.22).Ateachspotwhereyouseerepeatbendsintheline,youare
probablylookingatazone.
Second, you may have too many zones drawn on your chart (see
Figure 4.23). If you have too many zones drawn your chart, then you will
probably experience two likely problems. The first problem is that you
will notice many trade opportunities. If you are trading the daily chart
and notice that you have a trade nearly every day, you probably have too

critical areas on the chart, and price does not always reach these critical

The fifth problem that you may come up against when trading with
zones is this: If the market trades beyond the zone it does not mean that
the market has broken the zone. This is an important and critical point
for the naked trader. Remember zones are beer bellies, they are squishy,
they are fat, and they consist of a wide range on the chart. This means
that sometimes the market will push into the zone, and it may look like

the naked trader watches carefully, and if a catalyst appears, a trade is
triggered. The key to successful trading is to wait for the very best trad-
ing opportunities. These opportunities occur when the market reaches a
well-defined zone and then prints a catalyst. These are golden opportuni-
ties. The next section is all about trading catalysts, how to identify them
and specific rules for trading each of the high probability, naked-trading
set-ups.

Identifying the Transition
Asabreakouttraderyoutakeadvantageofthenaturalrhythmofthemar-
ket and, in particular, the transition between the boring, restricted move-
mentoftherange-boundmarketandthefiercestrongmovesofthetrending
market.Whenwillyouknowthatthemarketischanging?Howdoyoude-
terminethattheconsolidationperiodisover?Willthemarketofferaclue
whenitisabouttomoveintoatrendingphase?
Is it possible to determine when the market ends the directionless
phase and begins the strong trending phase? The answer is yes, and you
willuseyouroldfriend,thesupportandresistancezone.Thesupportand
resistance zone will be the threshold by which you judge the movement
of the market once again. This time the support and resistance zone will
markthelineinthesandforthenakedversionofthebreakouttrade—the
last-kisstrade.
Thefirststepofthelast-kisstradeistoidentifytheconsolidationzone.
One way to visualize a consolidation zone is to draw a box on the chart.
This box will contain the choppy movements of the directionless mar-
ket.Thisboxshouldencompassthemarketmovementduringthechoppy,
drifting-marketphase(seeFigure5.4).
Theimportantthingtorememberhereisthatthebox,whichcontains
themarketactivity,isformedbybothasupportzoneandaresistancezone.
Thisboxofmarketactivityshouldpopoutonthechart—itshouldbeob-
viousthatthemarketisstuckbetweenbothofthezones.Typically,there
willbeseveraltouchesoneithersideofthezones.InFigure5.5weseethat
therearethreetouchesatthetopofthebox(marketfoundresistance)and
twotouchesatthebottomofthebox(marketfoundsupport).
Theconsolidationphaseinsideoftheboxmaycontinueforsometime.
However, once the market breaks out toward either the support zone or
the resistance zone, the last-kiss trader takes notice. For many breakout
traders,themoveoutsideoftheconsolidationboxwilltriggeratrade.How-
ever,thelastkisstradeisnottriggeredatthisstage.

These failed breakouts, the fake-outs, are the primary reason traders
find it difficult to consistently apply breakout trading systems. Breakout
systems are simply wrong too often. Breakout systems may occasionally

Once the market trades through the entry price, the last-kiss trade
is on. There are two stop loss signals for the last-kiss trade. The first
stop loss is the emergency stop loss, and this is placed at the midpoint
of the consolidation box. Under most circumstances this stop loss will
notbehit.

WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
Some traders may refer to the big shadow as an engulfing candlestick,
but it is more than that, as there are specific rules associated with the
big shadow, including how to trade it, and specific optimizers for the
trading set-up. The big shadow is essentially a two-candlestick formation
in which the second candle completely dwarfs the first candlestick. This
second candlestick is known as the big-shadow candlestick. The defining

candlesticks have a very wide range. Both of these big shadows are the
largest candlestick the market has seen in some time. In Figure 6.1 the

Ideally,thebigshadowshouldhavethegreatestrangeoftheprevious

the stop loss is closer to the entry price, but historically, the very large
big shadows have a much higher success rate. Back-test this for yourself
to see if the very large big shadows you trade have a higher success
rate.

IDENTIFYING WAMMIES AND MOOLAHS
Wammies and moolahs occur on any timeframe, in any market, so these
catalysts are similar to most of the other naked trading patterns in this
book. Wammies and moolahs are unique versions of the double bottom
and double-top formations, respectively. You will learn how to filter out
subpardouble-bottomanddouble-toptrades.Concentratingononlythose
double bottoms and double tops with optimal trade characteristics (such
aswammiesandmoolahs)willallowyoutotradeonlythosedoublebottom
anddoubletopsthatofferthehighprobabilityofapayoff.
Wammies and moolahs also fit into the general category of reversal
patterns.Nakedtraderswhoenjoyenteringtradesatturningpointsinthe
marketwillfindwammiesandmoolahsparticularlyinterestinganduseful.
Before we jump into these price patterns, it may be useful to list several
important market truths. We will incorporate these seven market truths
whenwelookattradingwammiesandmoolahs.
1. If the market touches a zone twice in succession, it will often move
awayfromthezone.
2. Twotouchesonazonefromabovesuggestsamarketbottom.
3. Whenthemarketmakeshigherlows,itwilloftencontinueupward.
4. Twotouchesonazonefrombelowsuggestsamarkettop.
5. Whenthemarketmakeslowerhighs,itwilloftencontinuedownward.
6. Abullishcandlestickonasupportzonesuggeststhemarketwilltrade
higher.
7. A bearish candlestick on a resistance zone suggests the market will
tradelower.
Wammies and moolahs are based on these market observations. If
you agree with these market observations, then you may enjoy trading
wammiesandmoolahs.
HOW TO TRADE WAMMIES
As a naked trader, you get paid to observe market patterns, test these
patterns to validate their usefulness, and then execute trades based on
these patterns. These naked trading patterns occur over and over again,
in many markets, on many timeframes. Wammies are a specific subset of
thedouble-bottomformation.

the market is moving higher it will not take out the lowest low of the

with a nice bullish candlestick; the close of the candlestick is up near the
high. At 2, the second touch is a few pips higher than the first touch, which
qualifies this double bottom as a wammie. At 3, the buy stop is placed a
few pips above the second bullish candlestick after the second touch. No-
tice that there are several candlesticks after the second touch, but the buy
stop is placed above the first bullish candlestick with a closing price near
the high of the candlestick. Only the second bullish candlestick after the
second touch qualifies as a valid wammie entry candlestick. The wammie
buy stop should be placed a few pips above the first strong bullish candle-
stick. At 4, the stop loss is placed a few pips below the first touch for a total
risk of 150 pips. At 5, the market achieves the profit target at the next zone
at 78.20 for a total of 235 pips.
One final note about the wammie trade: It is important to only take
those wammie trades that touch the zone once, move away from the
zone, and then touch the zone again. Moving away from the zone after
the first touch is critical, and this is why there is a rule for the number
of candlesticks between the two touches. A wammie trade is only valid if
there are at least six candlesticks between the first and second touches.
If there are fewer than six candlesticks, it is likely that the market may
be gearing up for a push beyond the zone. This is because breakouts often
occur when the market repeatedly touches the zone in quick succession.
Take a look at the charts, you will probably notice that many breakouts
occur after the market repeatedly touches a zone (see Figure 7.12 for an
excellent example of this).
The very best wammies will not have very quick touches on the zone,
but rather the market will touch the zone, start to trade higher for some
time, and then fall back down to touch the zone again. Be wary of wammies
with quick touches on the zone, as this may suggest the market is going to
push through the zone in the immediate future.
The wammie trade is a simple but powerful trade. Now go back and
take a look at the charts in the double bottom section of this chapter.

Notice that there are more than six candlesticks between the candlestick
that first touches the zone and the candlestick that touches the zone again
at 2 on the chart. At 3, the sell stop is placed a few pips below the low
of the first bearish candlestick after the second touch. The market triggers
this sell stop on the next candlestick and falls to the first zone at 118.15, but
because this zone is only 67 pips lower than the entry price (and the stop
loss is 108 pips from the entry price), the trade is held all the way down to
the next zone at 117.50, at 4 on the chart, for an overall profit of 133 pips.
The moolah trade is a simple but powerful trade, the rules are simply
the same as for the wammie trade, but reversed for double tops. Take a
look at the charts in the double top section of this chapter. Do you no-
tice anything about the two double-top set-ups? Compare the double top
inFigures 7.5and 7.6. What do you notice about those trade set-ups? For

Kangaroo Tails
Whenever you find that you are on the side of the
majority,itistimetoreform.
—MarkTwain
The kangaroo tail is an extremely powerful catalyst. It is an obvious
clue to the naked trader that the market has gone too far. There are
manytradersaroundtheworldwhosimplytradethisonesimpleyet
powerfultradingsetup.
WHAT IS A KANGAROO TAIL?
A kangaroo tail is a distinct price pattern. It is one candlestick that is
easy to spot. Once you become familiar with this catalyst you will see
them everywhere and often at reversal points. Kangaroo tails may print
buysignals—bullishkangarootails—andbearishkangarootails,whichare
sell signals. The kangaroo tail has two parts: the kangaroo body and the
kangarootail.Allkangarootailsaresingle-candlestickformations.
S I N G L E - C A N D L E S T I C K F O R M A T I O N
A price pattern made up of a single candlestick. The definition and validity of
the price pattern is dependent on characteristics of the candlestick relative to
thesurroundingcandlesticks.

KANGAROO-TAIL TIPS
There are several optimizers associated with the kangaroo-tail trade. If you
have the patience to wait for only the very best kangaroo tails, watch for
the following characteristics:
(cid:2)
Kangaroo tails with a very long tails.
(cid:2)
Kangaroo tails with much room to the left. The ideal kangaroo tails
print at an area on the chart that has not seen price action in a long
time.
(cid:2)
Bullish kangaroo tails with a closing price that is higher than the open-
ing price.
(cid:2)
Bearish kangaroo tails with a closing price that is lower than the open-
ing price.
(cid:2)
The candlestick after the bullish kangaroo tail trades higher than the
high of the kangaroo tail.
(cid:2)
The candlestick after the bearish kangaroo tail trades lower than the
low of the kangaroo tail.
(cid:2)
Kangaroo tails with a greater range than the previous 10 candlesticks.
(cid:2)
Kangaroo tails that trigger the buy stop or sell stop entry on the first
candlestick after the kangaroo tail.
There are also several red flags, so watch out for these:
(cid:2)
Kangaroo tails with very short tails.
(cid:2)
Kangaroo tails that do not print on a zone; these are not valid kangaroo
tails.
(cid:2)
Kangaroo tails preceded by giant candlesticks. This suggests that the
trend may continue, and the kangaroo tail may only be a pause.
(cid:2)
When the open and the close of the kangaroo tails are not contained
bytherangeofthepreviouscandlestick.
If you back-test the kangaroo tail, you may find that this trade
set-up consistently identifies key turning points in the market. Go to

The Big Belt
It is great to be a blonde. With low expectations it’s

There are a few moments in life that eclipse all others. Some of them
are obvious, and you anticipate them: the birth of your first child,

momentsseemtocomefromnowhere,outoftheblue,buttheyareoften
just as critical and just as important. The first time you realize you will
becomeaprofitableasanakedtradermaybeonesuchmoment.Thetricky
thing about these surprising moments is this: You never know when they
will occur, and when they do, it is important to seize them. These criti-
cal, beautiful moments come and go, but you must be ready for them at
anytime.

THE BEARISH BIG BELT
A bearish big belt will occur at a market high and a bullish big belt will
occur at market low. In both cases the belts will print on a zone. In Fig-
ure9.1weseeabearishbigbeltontheAUD/USDdailychart.Thedefining
characteristic of the bearish big belt is the jump in the market price. In

will also stick out above recent price action. Notice that the bearish big

for back testing. You may be surprised with the win rate of the big belt
tradingset-up.
Although it is common to see bearish big belts on lower time frames,
such as the one-hour chart and the four-hour chart, sticking to the daily
charts only will enable you to maintain a high win rate when trading this
set-up. So, although it may be tempting to multiply your trades by taking

your bearish big belt trade is to simply wait for the market to reach the

TRENDY KANGAROO CHARACTERISTICS
The critical characteristic of the trendy-kangaroo-trading set-up is, of
course, the trendy kangaroo candlestick. This candlestick will stick out
beyond where the market paused. It is critical for the trendy kangaroo to
printawayfromtheothercandlestickswhicharestuckinthebox.Because
thetrendykangarooisalwaysinthedirectionofthetrend,itisimpossible
for the trendy kangaroo to have a large amount of room to the left. This
is in contrast to the standard kangaroo-tail trade. The trendy kangaroo is
judged by how far the tail sticks out beyond the recent market pause. If
there is much of the tail sticking out in an area on the chart where the

because they occur during trends, so there will always be price action to

recent choppy price action. Otherwise, the standard kangaroo tail rules

You may notice that the daily AUD/JPY trendy kangaroo set-up
(Figure 10.8) is not on a zone. This makes the trendy kangaroo unique;
it is a naked trading set-up that is not always found on a zone. However,
under most circumstances a minor zone willbe seen at the market pause
immediately before the trendy kangaroo. Notice how the highs of these

Exiting the
Trade
There’s a trick to the Graceful Exit. It begins with
the vision to recognize when a job, a life stage, a
relationship is over—and to let go. It means leaving
what’s over without denying its value.
—Ellen Goodman
There are six stages for every trade you take. The first stage is the anal-
ysis: You take a look at the charts and decide whether a trade should
be taken. The second stage is the planning stage: You decide if you
will take a trade, and now is the time to develop a trading plan. You will
place your order to enter this trade at a certain price, and you will place
your exit for the trade at a certain price, whether it be at a loss or gain.
The third stage of every trade involves the entry: the price at which you
begin your journey on the trade. This price may have been predetermined;
you may have decided that you will enter the trade if the market goes to a
certain price, or perhaps you just use a market order and enter the trade
immediately at the current market price. The fourth stage involves manag-
ing the trade, this is where Market BiofeedbackTM comes in, and you are
anticipating and reacting to the market data that comes back to you via
the chart while you are holding your trade. The fifth stage is the exit. This
is the most important stage of the trade. You make your money when you
make your exit and your paycheck is received. The sixth and final stage is
alearningphase.Thisiswhereyouexamineyourtradefrombeginningto
end and give yourself a grade. This may be automated learning (you sim-
plydumpyourtradeinformationintoaspreadsheetsuchastheoneavail-

Ifyouwouldratherhaveahighwinrate,thenyouwillprobablyhave

Runners
The runners are those traders who are looking out for the next big thing.
These traders want to capture a large chunk of profit every trade. These
traders have a strong sense of confidence. This confidence is unwavering

hopeful that the next trade will end up as a beautiful, long-lasting trade.

runners and try to capture a trending market for huge profits. The impor-

Exits for Gunners
Gunnersareinterestedinquickprofits.Gunnerswanttogetinandoutof
a trade, and gunners love winning trades. The zone exit and the split exit
aredesignedtotakeprofitsatthemostimportantspotsonthechart—the
zones.Recallthatthezonesarethosespotsonthechartwherethemarket
repeatedly reverses. There is another characteristic of the zones that is
importantforthenakedtrader.
Zones are also magnets: The market tends to be attracted to these
places on the chart. In other words, zones are simultaneously price bar-
riers and price magnets. Exits based on zones take advantage of the fact
thatzonesattractprice.

Exits for Runners
Runners see things a bit differently. Runners love bagging the big trade.
Runners have incredibleconfidence intheirtradingsystems. Runners are
in it for the long haul. Runners use exit strategies to take advantage of
trendingmarkets.
The first exit for runners is similar to some of the gunner exits. This

LadderExit Theladderexitissimilartothepreviousexitsinthatzones
are used to identify profit targets. The difference, however, is that each
zone is a potential profit target. When using the ladder exit, the naked
trader never knows where the final exit price will be; this is because the
ladderexitallowsthemarketsomebreathingroom.
This is how the ladder exit works: Once a trade is initiated, the stop
loss is moved in accordance with how far the market has moved. So, for
example,ifthemarketmovesfromtheentrypricetotheclosestzone,then
the stop loss is moved to breakeven. Once the market moves further to
the second closest zone to the entry price the stop loss is moved from
breakeven to the first zone, and so forth. The easiest way to see how the
ladderexitisexecutedistolookatanexample.
Figure 11.6 is the GBP/USD four-hour chart. A bearish big belt prints
on the 1.6460 zone. The market trades down to the 1.6270 zone, so the

sothatyou mayidentifyit,and thenmovebeyond thecycleof doomand
intotheworldofconsistent,profitabletrading.
Phase 1: The Search
In this phase you are searching for a trading system. You may look for
yourtradingsystemintradingbooks,inonlinetradingforums,tradinged-
ucation websites, or you may find your trading system from speaking to
another trader at a conference or meeting. In the end, it is not important
where you find a trading system, only that you find a trading system that
appearstobesuccessful.
If you are unable to find a trading system that you are comfortable
with,thenyou’reprobablyinphase1.Youwillleavephase1onlyonceyou

ofphase1isthatthetradingsystemisthesolution.Onceyouhavefound
atradingsystemthatisexciting,youwillmovebeyondphase1.
Phase 2: The Action
Phase 2 is the action phase. This is the fun part; you begin to trade your
system. If you are like most traders, you will leap into phase 2 with just
about every trading system that looks decent. The excitement of using a
new trading system is irreplaceable. This excitement comes from the un-
known (more about this later). Will this new trading system work? Will
you become a billionaire trading this system? Is it everything you hope it
tobe?
Amid this excitement you begin to trade the system with high hopes.
It is highly unlikely, given that you are extremely excited to start trading
your new system, that you would have time to test your trading system.
Theproofforyournewtradingsystemissooverwhelmingthatthereisno

LIVING IN THE CYCLE
The cycle of doom may be familiar to you; it is certainly familiar to me.

information. Disregarding market information is stubborn trading. If you
join the group of stubborn traders who hold onto beliefs despite contra-
dictory market information, you too may find them to be very expensive
beliefs (see Chapter 16 for more on expensive beliefs).
The third and final part of the trade is the exit. Now, your style of exit
strategy is obviously something that is unique and special to your person-
ality. You simply must trade and exit in a way that make sense to you, and
fits with your view of the markets. The exit is where the money is made.
Exits literally discriminate traders; traders who consistently make money
know how to apply exits. Those traders who consistently lose money usu-
ally have great difficulty with exits.

this:Howwillyoudealwithdrawdowns?Willyouuseastop-tradingrule?
How will you recharge your batteries and jump back into trading after a

You may decide to get away from the charts, and, if possible, get away
from your trading station and take a trip out of town after experiencing
a drawdown. The theory behind this is if you get away from trading for
a while you will (1) avoid revenge trading (a quick way to blow up your
account),and(2)comebacktothechartswithafreshperspective.
The best way to come back to the charts fresh is to simply follow a
planned sequence whenever you experience a maximum drawdown. For
example, you may decide to follow this five-step sequence: (1) Go away.

trader Ashkan Bolour suggests that there is always time for making money
in the markets. He says, “If something is not working, step away, re-analyze
your trades, and then come back to the markets. Stepping away from the
markets will give your mind and your body time to rest, and you will be
much better for it when you come back to the markets.”
Coming out of an extended drawdown your goal should be to slowly
build up your confidence. It is necessary to have a regimented routine
for getting through these drawdowns. Without a strong structure, without
rules designed to keep you from emotional revenge trading after a draw-
down, you’re almost certain to fall into undisciplined trading and to take
on excessive risk. Design a plan today so that if a drawdown appears, you
are ready for it, because you will not feel like designing a drawdown plan
in the midst of a drawdown.
Correlated Trades
Correlated trades are perhaps the most obvious threats to your trading ac-
count. For example, from time to time the markets may print daily kanga-
roo tails on many of the yen pairs. If I decide to take the daily kangaroo tail
on the USD/JPY, AUD/JPY, NZD/JPY, CAD/JPY, EUR/JPY, and GBP/JPY, I
must be careful. What will happen if each of these trades are available on
the same day, and I have a maximum drawdown limit of 5 percent for the
week? With a risk of 1 percent per trade, I quickly reach my weekly draw-
down limit simply by taking these trades should they all end up as losing
trades.
Oneobvioussolutionistoreducetheper-traderiskwhenseveralcor-
related currency pairs offer trading set-ups. If you have a background in
statistics, you understand what a correlation is, but if you do not un-
derstand correlation very well, take a look at the correlation video at
www.fxjake.com/book. You will learn how to measure the correlation be-
tween any two currency pairs. Once you have determined that two cur-
rency pairs arecorrelated, the next step istoreduce your overall riskfor
correlatedtrades.
Here is an example of a plan for managing correlated, simultaneous
trades.

As for the entry price, there are several possible methods of entering
a trade. You may take a market order (executing the trade at the current
market price). You may take a limit order (executing the trade after the
market retraces, or moves in the “wrong” direction). Or you may decide
to use the recommended buy stops (or sell stops for sell trades), execut-
ingthetradeentryonlyoncethemarketmovesintheexpecteddirection.
Additionally,youmayalsodecidetouseanalternativeentrystrategy:You
may wait for the market to offer a clue. In other words, you enter your
trade once you receive market feedback, once the market suggests it will

Traders may get in the way during the analysis of the markets, when
decisions are made concerning which trades to take. Many traders have
foundthattoomuchmarketanalysisiscounterproductive.Itisofteneasier
andmoreefficienttohaveaquicklookatthemarkets,decideonacourse
ofaction,andthentosimplysetthetradesandforgetthem.
Abe Cofnas, a renowned trader who deals in both spot forex and
forex options, has this to say about market analysis: “It is so fascinating
to see—but for me I often find my best trading results occur when I do
minimal analysis, and let my visual sense of price action let me react to
andnotanticipateconditions.”

into the wee hours of the night. If you are under the influence, it is best to
avoid making any trading decisions.
Good habits should extend into the psychological realm. If you enjoy
self- hypnosis or meditation, you may find that your trading improves dras-
tically when you consistently find time each day to practice self-hypnosis or
meditation. (There are more resources for you at www.fxjake.com/book if
youwouldliketolearnmoreaboutmeditationorself-hypnosis.)Perhaps
you decide to take some time each day to mentally recharge before you
makeyourtradingdecisions,beforeyousitdownandanalyzethecharts.
If you are thinking right now “I do not need to spend any time being
quiet; I just do not have time for that,” please at least consider a new ap-
proachtoyourtrading.Foronemonthtryusingself-hypnosis,meditation,
or just some simple quiet time alone before you jump into your trading

Each trader takes a different approach to the application of the
trading system. For example, perhaps trader Elliott decides to trade the
big-shadow set-ups on the daily charts. Elliott will only take those big-
shadow set-ups that look to be very high-probability set-ups. The bearish
big-shadow set-ups must have a close down near the low, and the bullish
big-shadow set-ups must have a close near the high. The big-shadow

Choosing Your Playing Field
In many ways, the timeframe you choose to trade is determined by your
lifestyle. If you don’t have four or five hours a day to sit down and watch
thecharts,itwillbedifficultforyoutobeafive-minutechartscalper.Un-
less you have an automated exit for your shorter-timeframe trading, it is
unlikelythatyouwillbeabletotradetheshorter-timeframechartswithout
severalhoursofscreentime.Evenifyoudohaveanextrafourorfivehours
each day, you may be better off avoiding trading the shorter-timeframe
charts. Many traders have found it is much easier to simply take a look
at the charts once a day, put in your trading orders, and then walk away.
Sometimes,afterafewyearsofthissortoftrading,successfultraderswill
movedowntoshortertimeframes.Ageneralruleofthumbisthis:Trading
shortertimeframesmeansasmallermarginforerror.
Trading the shorter timeframe means that you must be precise and
decisive when executing your trades. An example will best illustrate why
thisisthecase.Ifyoudecidetotradethefive-minuteEUR/USDchartinthe
hopesofpulling10pipsofprofitfromthemarkets,thenyouarepayinga

the EUR/USD and the price for selling the EUR/USD) on the EUR/USD is

ingtogain100pipsandwillneedtocapture102pipstocoverthespread,
sothisisanoverallcommissionof1.9percent—asignificantreductionin
the commission cost. Longer-term trading is not only cheaper, it is easier
to execute successfully. If you initiate a daily chart trade and enter your
trade at a poor price, perhaps you miss your entry price by 3 pips, you
may, instead, make 97 pips, rather than the full 100 pips. This is a reduc-
tionofprofitsby3percent;notgreat,butcertainlysomethingyourtrading

you want to trade because you want to make money, perhaps trading is
for you. If, however, you want to trade because you want excitement, or
you want to be able to tell people that you are a trader, or because you
love the excitement of having money at risk, then perhaps trading is not

SIX STEPS TO BECOMING AN EXPERT
Although it may seem that becoming an expert is a very difficult thing to
do,itisreallyrathersimple.Aswithmanythingsinlife,ifyouputthework

too many zones on your chart. If in doubt, err on the side of using fewer
zones on your chart.
As a naked trader, you will spend a lot of time waiting for the market
to hit your zones. This is fine; this is part of what it means to be a naked
trader. If you find yourself feeling as though you need to take action, per-
haps you should back-test your trading. Test one year’s worth of data (on
a shorter timeframe), and then test a lower frequency trading system on
longer-timeframe charts. Compare the profitability of each back-test. Are
you surprised at what you find? Sometimes making money is easier when
you do not trade. Sometimes avoiding trades is just as important as taking
trade opportunities when they arise.
Goal:Learntoquicklyidentifyzonesonanychart.
Step Two: Decide on a Catalyst
The second step toward expertise is for you to decide on which catalyst
youwilluseinyourtrading.Youhavelearnedaboutseveralcatalysts(and
there are more at www.fxjake.com/book), and hopefully by now you have
back-testedsomeofthem.Sowhichoneresonateswithyou?Doyouprefer

thatfitswithyourbeliefswillhelpyoutorideoutanybumpsinyourequity
curveandavoidthecycleofdoom.
Goal: Choose the one trading catalyst that you want to build
your expertise on.
Step Three: Back-Test
By now you probably have a good understanding of all the benefits asso-
ciated with back-testing your trading system. Back-testing will verify that
your trading system works. It will help to build your confidence in your
trading system. It will help you when you are experiencing drawdowns,
it will help save you from falling back into the cycle of doom. In short,

back-testing is what separates those consistently profitable traders from
thosetraderswhoareforeverstuckinthecycleofdoom.
If there is one idea that you take from this book let it be this: Back-
testing your trading system is the one thing that you can do to acceler-
ate your trading. This one thing is the most important habit that you can
develop in an effort to become a professional trader. Back-testing is that
important.
Youshouldhaveacleargoalinmindwhenyouback-testyourtrading
system. Try to triple your trading account with a small percentage at risk
for each trade (e.g. 1 percent or 2 percent at risk). Tripling your trading
accountwillhelpyoutobelieveinyourtradingskills.
Goal: Risking 2 percent or less, triple your back-testing
account.
Step Four: Forward Test
If you have back-tested your trading system, and you are happy with the
results, you’re ready for the next step. The next step is to employ your
trading system in real time. Unfortunately, this is a very slow stage. You

this stage, you probably cannot wait to begin trading your standard live
account.
Goal: Risking 2 percent or less on each trade, triple your small
account.
Step Six: Trade a Live Account
Most traders do not do what you have just done. You have built your
confidence over the previous five steps. Now you are ready. It is time to
put into practice what you know, and by this stage you will be excited.
Make sure that you maintain your discipline and continue todo the same
thing that you have been doing. The important thing here is to follow
your system, without regard to whether you are in the midst of a lucky
streak or an unlucky streak.) Remember, you have the power of your
trading,andyouunderstandthatyouwillsuccessfullypullprofitsfromthe

The most important thing at this stage is to duplicate what you have

bored with consistent trading profits, but it may happen. You may want

Open a chart, and wait for a new candlestick to appear. If you are
watching a shorter timeframe chart, such as the 30-minute chart, after a
few minutes, about three minutes or so, take a screenshot of the candle-
stick. The idea is that you are taking snapshots of the candlestick as it is

Do this for all of the snapshots. Watching the candlestick print like
this is a lot like watching your child grow up. Maybe in some ways you
may be able to anticipate the future, but there will be turning points that
are critical, and by recording the candlestick at regular intervals you will
be able to see how well you can anticipate the market. The point of this
exercise is not to show you how unpredictable the markets are, or to
encourage you to get in touch with your inner psychic. The point of this
exercise is that, by watching the market, you earn valuable experience.

bank trader trades with discipline. The bank hires intelligent trainees to

thatthebanktradersdonotrisktoomuchontheirtrades.

does not mow the lawn the same way every single week, you may not
be taking your trades the same way even though you are trading the
same system. Taking records of what you are doing is invaluable for self-
assessments later, in order to look at exactly how you are executing your
trades and what changes you might be making.
Missing Out
Traders may end up with a losing streak simply because they miss out on
some trades. This is a particularly difficult problem for those traders who
have a low win rate. It is obviously possible to be a successful and prof-
itable trader—in fact to be a professional trader—with a trading system
that has a very low win rate. The problem is that if winning trades do not
occur that often, it is imperative that all trades are taken to make sure the
winners are captured.
If you trade a system that has a low win rate, and you miss out on
some of the trades, and these trades end up being large winners, it can be
disheartening. Obviously, if you trade a system with a very low win rate,
you need large winning trades to maintain profits. Missing out on these
winners can be psychologically demoralizing; it can be difficult to maintain
your confidence in a trading system with a low win rate. There is an easy
solution, however.
If you want to make sure that you do not miss out on trades, or miss
out on trading information so that you can manage trades, technology may
be your answer. Today, there are many technical solutions for the naked
trader. Technology today allows traders to be almost anywhere and still
manage the trades.
The key is to be prepared. It is possible for the naked trader to simply
trade from a phone. With well-equipped phones, naked traders are able to
not only to place trades and manage trades, keeping tabs on live market
charts, they can also set alerts. If the market goes to a predetermined price

life. You can do three things, and if you practice these consistently they will
help to maintain your confidence.
Step One: The Reasons for Your Success
In order to be confident as a trader, you must consistently execute your
trading system as it was outlined in your system rules. More importantly,
you must know, without a doubt, the reason why you have chosen to exe-
cute your trading system. In other words, your beliefs must align with your
trading goals.
This is a foreign concept to most traders. Many traders assume that
they want to make money, and if they are not making money, the reason is
that they have not found the trading system that will allow them to make
money consistently. Notice how the emphasis for most traders is on the
system. The system yields the reward. The system is responsible for profits.
Unfortunately this emphasis on the system is incorrect.
The only traders who do not have to concern themselves with the
psychology of trading are those traders who use automated trading sys-
tems. You are influencing your trading results regardless of whether you ac-
knowledge this fact. Unless you are trading a purely mechanical system—a
pure automated trading system, you are influencing each and every one of
your trades. (Here is a test to see if your system is a purely automated sys-
tem. If you can be away from the Internet for a month and your system will
still trade and make money for you, then it is a purely automated system.)
Your thoughts, your beliefs, and whether you believe you are deserving of
profit all influence how you trade your trading system.
Think about and write down your answers to the following:
(cid:2)
How many wealthy people do you spend time with?
(cid:2)
Do you think that you will one day have a lot of money?
(cid:2)
When something goes wrong with money, do you think that this is “just
yourluck?”
(cid:2)
Whenyouseeawealthyperson,whatdoyouthink?
(cid:2)
Doyouthinkthatwealthypeoplearegoodpeople?
(cid:2)
Ifyoubecomeextremelywealthy,areyouworriedthatyourpersonal-
itymaychange?
To learn more about your answers to these questions and your atti-
tudes toward making money, go to www.fxjake.com/book.
Aligningyourtradinggoalswithyourfinancialpersonalityisimportant
and something that will occur regardless of whether you are consciously
awareofthis.

Step Two: The Rewards of Routine
The trading system you employ depends on you. You must identify and
execute trades. You must apply the risk management rules to each of your
trades. You must remain vigilant and ensure that you take all the trades that
your system identifies as high probability trades. In order to achieve all this,
you must have an established routine. This routine must be written down,
and it must include all the important variables for your trading system.
The rules for your trading system must include your trading routine.
Define what you will do, and what you will not do regularly. This will be
your trading routine. Adherence to your trading routine is the closest thing
you have to insurance against sloppy trading. Sloppy trading involves miss-
ing trades, trading the wrong lot size, placing the stop loss at the wrong
price, or poor execution when entering a trade.
At a minimum, this is what you should have written down for your
trading routine rules:
(cid:2)
When will you look for trades?
(cid:2)
How will you calculate your trade size? (There is a risk-free calcu-
lation spreadsheet, a great tool for calculating your trade size, at
www.fxjake.com/book.)
(cid:2)
Howoftenwillyoucheckthecharts?
(cid:2)
Howwillyoubealertedtotradingopportunities?
(cid:2)
Howwillyoubealertedwhenyouneedtomanageyourtrades?
Defining your trading routine is important because, over time, as you
begintoconsistentlycaptureprofits,youwillgainconfidenceinwhatyou
do.Thesimpleactofenteringyourtradeintotheriskcalculationspread-
sheet will often bring an anticipation of profits to come. There is great
powerinroutine.

have designed a well-planned trading routine that you can adhere to, you
arenowreadytoputintoplacefail-saferulesandtoolssoyoumayquickly
regainyourconfidencewhenitwavers.
The fastest way to regain your confidence is to back-test in a forex
tester. A losing streak can be put into proper perspective after you have
traded the GBP/USD over three years and found consistent profits in a
forex tester using the very same system that has you in a drawdown.
Back-testing in general is a one-size-fits-all remedy. Not only does back-

concentrate on what is important in your trading system. The simple act
of taking 50 trades in a forex tester (or your chosen back-testing software)
adds another 50 trades under your belt. You will have honed your skills to
identify valid trade set-ups and execute valid trades within the confines of
your system.
Spreadsheets can also help you. If you can, make some spread-
sheets with the data from your back-testing sessions. These data will help
put drawdowns into perspective. There is a great template for you at
www.fxjake.com/book. Download the spreadsheet there and enter your
back-testing data into the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet will calculate for
you the statistics of your trading system. Having the statistics in front of

Worst-Case Planning
Worst-caseplanningmeansplanningforthemaximumlossoneachtrade.
This way, the maximum loss cannot hurt you. Over time, by planning for
the same loss (your maximum loss, where your stop loss is placed), you
will become more efficient in executing your trades. This is the magic of
consistent risk management. If each trade has the same risk associated
withit,overtimeyouwillbuildupvaluableexperiencewiththisrisklevel.
If you keep your risk the same, the worst-case scenario for each and
every trade is the same. If you walk outside barefoot on a hot day on the
asphalt,yourfeetmayburn.However,ifyouwalkoutsideeverydaywhen

to drug addicts; over time, drug addicts must take more and more of the

prepared to lose this amount. Be prepared for these losing trades, and be
prepared for a sequence of losing trades.
Before long, the amount of money will not seem significant, and you
will begin to focus on trade execution. This is where the money is to be
made.
RISKY MONEY TRAPS
Why do most traders fail? Why is trading for consistent profits so difficult?
Traders are simply people who look to buy something when it is cheap,
and look to sell something when it is expensive. Traders get paid to be
bargain hunters and agile market participants. However, there are so many
people in the markets who find extreme difficulty attempting to extract
profits from the markets.
A close look at the reasons that traders fail—the risky money
traps—and how to overcome each of these traps will prepare you for en-
try into the markets. Remember to consider the other market participants.
Many of these people are well capitalized, and they have intelligent people
behind the construction and execution of their trading strategies. If you
find it difficult to overcome your own issues, if you fall into one of the risky
money traps before you have entered the markets, you are at a significant
disadvantage.
Your Account Is Unprotected
The number-one trading skill you need to succeed as a trader is the ability
to protect your trading account. This is paramount to all other goals, pro-

Traders who are unable to protect their money have difficulties with
beliefs. These traders may believe they are unworthy of large amounts of
money. They may also confuse their belief withthefacts. Beliefs may be-

If the market instead begins to trade higher and higher and higher,
I come to a crossroads. Perhaps I decide on one of the following three
courses of action: (1) I may decide to dump the trade because my belief
seems to be incorrect. (2) I may decide to move my stop loss higher, to
givethetradealittlemorebreathingroombecauseIknowthemarketwill

havedecidedtorewritemytradingplan(initialstoplossmoved,thetrade

Who do you think will win this battle of wits? Will I win or will the

Remember to keep your beliefs in perspective. There are no beliefs
worth more than your entire trading account. You work hard for your
money, so defend it. Throw away your beliefs when the market tells you
theyareincorrect.Keepyourmoneyinstead.

true; if you are able to trade the shorter timeframes you may find more
opportunities, if you are able to schedule more screen time,more time in
frontofyourcharts.
Please beware that “I need more screen time to trade” is not an ex-
cuse for avoiding back-testing. All of your systems should be vetted with
back-testing results, forward-testing results, and the smaller live-trading
account.
Most traders will use this excuse to create a case for leaving a job,
and this thinking is a dangerous place to be. Many traders are not quite
readytostarttradingfull-time,buttheythinkthatbyleavingtheirfull-time
permanent jobs, the added screen time will push them over the top and
makeiteasierforthemtoachievetradingsuccess.Sadly,thisisoftennot
true.
Your Job Is Holding You Back
Related to the I-need-more-screen-time trap is the I-gotta-dump-my-job
trap. Traders fantasize that more time, specifically more screen time, will
help them to achieve consistent profits. A little more focus will bring the
resultstheyarelookingforintheirtrading.
