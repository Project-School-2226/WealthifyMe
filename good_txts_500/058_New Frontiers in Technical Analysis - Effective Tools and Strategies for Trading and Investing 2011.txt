Preface
Inthestruggleforsurvival,thefittestwinoutattheexpenseoftheirrivals
becausetheysucceedinadaptingthemselvesbesttotheirenvironment.
—CharlesDarwin
This book has been assembled in response to the growing demand to
diversifyaninvestmentstrategythroughthenumerousstylesofcontemporary
market analysis and the ongoing search for increasing alpha. Although the
mostfrequentlyusedstyleofanalysisisfundamental,theadoptionoftechnical
analysis as an adjunct or preferred style of analysis is becoming increasingly
soughtafterandaccepted.
This evolution has become visible in many ways. One observation dis-
cussedinChapter1isthetrackingandmeasurementoftheuseandgrowthof

thereweremorethan1,000activeCharteredMarketTechnicians(CMTs)re-
sidingin76countries,representinga100percentincreaseinonlyfouryears.
Yet another measure is the growing interest in and reliance on the develop-
ment and implementation of innovative technical tools and strategies that
capitalizeonexistingmethods,suchasthosepresentedbythecontributorsto
thisbook.
The bridge between fundamental and technical analysis continues to
strengthen and the sophistication of each continues to develop. About a
centuryago,CharlesDow,whowasajournalist,entrepreneur,andtechnician,
created some of the world’s most popular equity indices, which are relied
on today by all market participants. About 30 years ago, the fundamental
term relative strength had only one meaning, until the publication of the

theories of fundamental analysis and technical analysis are evolving together
and affecting each other at rates faster than ever before. Therefore, a goal of
thisbookistoproperlydocumentandsharethegainsofthisevolution.
Thisbookcomprisescontributionsfromfiveindividualswhohavespent
most of their careers, if not all, studying the financial markets through a
“technical” lens with the goal of identifying, developing, and implementing
effective trading and investment strategies. These strategies attempt to cap-
italize on the experiences in their careers and explain how existing market
actionswillimpactthefuture.Theirmethodsarebasedontheexistingbody
ofknowledgeofTechnicalAnalysis,andhaveevolvedtosupportandappeal
totechnical,fundamental,andquantitativeanalystsalike.
I view the contributors as accomplished market participants who do
everything they can to continually adapt to the modern-day securities ex-
changeindustry.Theyareconstantlymodifyingandrefiningtheirmethodic
approachestothemarketsinordertoachievesuccess,andIfeelprivilegedto
beapartofthesharingoftheirstrategies.
These five individuals bring withthem a combined 150 years of market
experience.Theirmethods,atsomepointintime,werelikelysomewhatsim-
plistic, such as the application of moving averages, overbought and oversold
momentumindicators,trendingindicators,volumeanalysis,andsoforth.We
couldaskthemtorecallhowtheywouldusethesestudies,asI’mcertainthey
remember from their earlier days, but this has been done many times with
experiencedmarketprofessionals.
Rather, Chapter 1 begins with the release of previously undisclosed evi-
denceaboutthemostpreferredcharttypesandtechnicalstudies.Itcontinues
intoalucidandsimplesummaryoftheessentialelementsofthosecharttypes
and indicators. The following chapters continue with in-depth explanations
of the work of Julius de Kempenaer, Phil Erlanger, Cynthia Kase, Andrew
Kezeli, and Rick Knox. All of the chapters can be considered work that has
mostlyneverbeenseenbefore,andifseen,neverinthismuchdetail.Where
some parts of their work is considered intellectual property and therefore
proprietary, subjective discussions provide readers with challenging theories
and ideologies for their own use. Other parts certainly are not, and hope-
fully some, if not all, of the work contained in this book will be published
again and again, in the same way that Gerald Appel’s MACD indicator was
40yearsago.
Chapter 2 presents the work by Julius de Kempenaer on formalizing a

Erlanger on investing with seasonality and his four-step approach to trading
using Bias, Setups, Triggers, and Monitoring. Chapter 4 is a quantitative

a market technician. She explains her trading strategies using a multitude
of tools that address challenging subjects such as appropriate stop levels,

advantages of the unorthodox yet extremely powerful Market Profile into a

Defining Technical Analysis
Sometimes it seems that the majority of market participants may be misled
aboutthebroadscopeoftheoriesusedintheapplicationoftechnicalanalysis
whentryingtounderstandandforecastthefinancialmarkets.Mygutfeeling
isthatifweweretosamplearandomgroupofmarketparticipantstodefine
technical analysis, they would present terms such as price, moving averages,
charts,andoscillators.AsimpleInternetsearchconfirmedmysuspicionsabout
what words we would hear. Some of the definitions that can be easily found
do a good job of describing parts of the theory, while others should not be
readbyatechnicianwholacksasenseofhumor.
Threeofthebetterdefinitionsare:
1. Analysis of past price changes in the hope of forecasting future price
changes.
2. Analysis based on market action through chart study, moving averages,
volume,openinterest,formations,andothertechnicalindicators.
3. An approach to forecasting commodity prices that examines the patterns
of price change, rates of change, and changes in volume of trading and
∗
openinterest,withoutregardtounderlyingfundamentalmarketfactors.
Technical analysis offers much more than these definitions suggest. The
firstissogenericitcouldbeusedtodescribemanyfieldsofanalysis.Itsuggests
market participants study prices and fails to elaborate on the variety of data
types that can be analyzed. The second mentions market action, a common
termusedindescribingtechnicalanalysis,butthenrepeatsitselfbylistingthe
data sets that represent market action. It assumes that most of the methods

chapter is to create a one-sentence definition that broadens the scope of the
knowndefinitions.Ithasprovedtobeverychallengingtocomeupwithone
sentencethatdefinestechnicalanalysisinitsentirety.Ibelievethisisadebate
for the entire industry to continuously weigh in on, especially as technical
analysisevolves;furthermore,Idonotmeantosuggestthatanyonedefinition
wouldeverbeuniversallyacceptable.Atpresent,andwiththeinputofafew
friends,Ileantowardthefollowingdefinition:
Technical analysis is the extraction of information from market data into
objective visualizations through the use of mathematics with an emphasis
on investor behavior and supply and demand to explain the current and
anticipatethefuturepathofthefinancialmarkets.
This definition suggests that technical analysis comprises the following
fiveattributes:
1. Market data: Represents a variety of data sets that includes the most
frequently used ones such as price, volume, and open interest, but
does not exclude data sets such as volatility, ticks, ratios, and dividend
yields.
2. Objectivevisualizations:Apreferenceforanalyzinginformationinachart,
butvisualizationscouldbemorethanachart,suchasafigure,table,scatter
plot,orqueryofresults.
3. Use of mathematics: The application of measurements and calculations to

4. Emphasis on investor behavior and supply and demand: We have a bias for

(certainlynotall)usedforthismethodofanalyzingthefinancialmarkets.
The first principle states that market actions discount everything. This
premise suggests that all publicly available information—such as company-
specificnews,politicalchanges,weather,andsoforth—isalreadypricedinto
thecurrentvalueofasecurity.Thereforewedonotnecessarilyneedtoknow
why something is happening; we need only to understand the reaction of

The third principle is that history repeats itself—I can still hear my high
schoolhistoryteacher’svoiceashequoted,“Thosewhodonotlearnhistoryare

or the largest group of market participants transitions out of the financial
markets, the incoming generation does not learn or receive enough of the
previously accumulated information. Therefore we have an inherent bias to

it is far from being all-inclusive. Throughout this book, we will familiarize

A line chart is a very elegant and simple type of chart to look at. It
providesconvenienceforfasteranalysisbecauseitshowstheoveralldirection

a fundamental analyst scanning a list of securities for performance changes
andfundamentaltrends,andoverallverylong-termanalysis.Forexample,it
couldbeahistoricallookataneconomicreleaselikegrossdomesticproduct
(GDP), the price/earnings (P/E) ratio of a stock, or the closing price of a

A bar chart is slightly more complex than a line chart in that it offers
three more data points per occurrence, when such data exists. It shows the

advantageinidentifyingmoreinformationfasterthanothercharttypes.Here
we can quickly see that 13 of the 18 trading days in February were up-days
(orhollow-bodiedcandles)andtheothersixweredown-days(ordark-bodied
candles).
A logarithmic chart is designed to represent the percent change between
price increments on the y-axis. As the values on the y-axis get larger, the
distance between them will shrink to a distance that is relative to the per-
centage change. For example, a security that goes from $10 to $20 has ex-
perienced a $10 change or an increase of 100 percent. A security that goes
from$100to$110hasalsoexperienceda$10changebutonlya10percent
increase.Thereforetheverticaldistanceonthey-axisshouldbegreaterforthe

Evidence of Chart Type Popularity
Nowthatwearefamiliarwiththeline,bar,candle,log,andintradaycharts,
we can discuss the preference of these chart types by market participants
who analyze the financial markets through interaction with the Bloomberg
ProfessionalService.

theMiddleEastandSouthAfrica(MESA).Inotherwords,ofahypothetical

and2inMESA.
Figure 1.8 displays the average chart-type preference of market partic-
ipants from 2005 to 2010. This reveals, on average, that the line chart is
preferred about half the time, the bar chart about one quarter of the time,
the candle chart about one fifth of the time, and that the log chart is rarely
preferred.
Figure1.9displaystheaveragepreferenceforhistoricalchartsandintraday
charts by market participants from 2005 to 2010. This reveals, on average,
that the historical chart is chosen more than twice as often as the intraday
chart, or about 69 percent of the time, while the intraday chart is preferred
about31percentofthetime.

because the markets experienced a large percentage move. The decline in

Evidence of Technical Indicator Popularity
Regardless of the chart type that you prefer, chartists and technicians take
price and apply an abundance of calculations to it in order to gain a better
understandingofwhatpriceormarketactionsaretellingthem.AquestionI
frequentlyhearfromthosewhoarestartingtousetechnicalanalysisis“What
indicators (calculations) should I use?” In my opinion, there is no “right”
technical indicator. The selection and application of one or a handful of
studiesisbasedonaperson’sinvestmentstyle,tradingstrategy,risktolerance,
goals, and available time commitment to learn the ins and outs of those
indicators independently and together. We could back-test these indicators

RelativeStrengthIndex
Therelativestrengthindex isusuallyreferredtoasamomentumindicatoror
oscillator. It is called “relative” because the calculation compares the average
size of the up-days to the average size of the down-days over a specified
timeframe.Forexample,ifweanalyzethepricechangeofasecurityforeach
ofthepast14daysandnoticethatpricewentup$1.00tentimesanddown
$0.25 four times, we can quickly and easily say that price went up $10 and

istherelationshipthattheRSIisextractingfrommarketactionsonarolling
basis,butisnottheexactcalculation.
The indicator is scaled onto an axis that has a low of 0 and a high of
100. Usually by default, horizontal lines are drawn at 70 and 30 to signify
momentum in the upward and downward direction, or what is commonly
referredtoasoverboughtandoversold respectively.Itisalsoimportanttopoint
out that an RSI level of 50 signifies equal performance of up-periods versus
down-periods.Themostcommonlook-backperiodforRSIis14.Someprefer
9or21,andI’veseensomegoaslowas3and5.
RSI is traditionally interpreted as “Sell when overbought and buy when
oversold.” This interpretation can be meaningful primarily in range-bound
markets with areas of predefined support and resistance. It is important for
RSI to confirm the direction of price. If price and RSI fail to confirm each
other near support or resistance or during breaks of these levels, a change in
trendmaybenear.Wecandefineconfirmationasnewhighsornewlowsin
bothinstrumentsatapproximatelythesametime.
If RSI travels above 70 while price fails to break resistance, you may
choose to be bearish in anticipation of a pullback because high levels of
momentum did not lead to price breaking resistance. Alternatively, if price
pierces resistance but RSI does not reach overbought, momentum is not
behindthenewhighssoyoumaychoosetobebearish.

The opposite would be true for a bullish view. When RSI travels below
30andpriceisholdingabovesupport,youmightchoosetobebullishbecause
large downside momentum did not force a break of support. Alternatively,
whenRSIisabove30andpricepiercessupportyoumaychoosetobebullish
because momentum to the downside is not strong and the break of support
mayonlybetemporary.
Volume analysis is very complementary to these methods of using RSI.
If volume is light near resistance or support, it suggests market participants
have finished pushing price in that direction. There will be more discussion
ofvolumelater.
RSIinatrendingmarketisvieweddifferently.Whenamarketistrending,
allwewanttoknowisifit’sgoingtocontinueorreverse.Iftheoveralltrend
is down and RSI reaches an overbought reading, the trend may be changing
to an upward direction. The start of a trend change usually appears like
sideways movement. Therefore the rally that occurred in the downtrend to
causetheoverboughtreadingislikelytoatleastpartiallycorrectitselfbecause
the market isn’t fully confident in a change in trend yet. A trend change can
be confirmed if RSI stays above oversold in the correction and when price

Finally, it is fairly common for RSI to be biased to the larger trend for
thatsecurityandtheoverallmarket.Duringuptrends,theRSIleveltendsto
becomemoreoverboughtandlessoversold.Duringdowntrends,theRSIline
tends to become more oversold and less overbought. Therefore, in uptrends
youcouldanticipatetheoverboughtleveltobemorelike75–80andoversold
levels to be 35–40. In downtrends you could anticipate overbought levels of
55–60 and oversold levels of 20–25. These levels are a rule of thumb. What

levels in a downtrend to RSI levels in a range to RSI levels in an uptrend.
The violation of these levels is alerting and confirming to a change in the
behavior of trend. Let’s take a look at an example of both divergence and
overbought/oversoldbias.

In Figure 1.12 there are seven zones to discuss where price and RSI
movements depict trend direction. In zone 1, price is in a downtrend and
is being coffered lower by a downward-sloping resistance line. Price set
four lower lows while RSI made three higher lows and did not get over-
sold on the fourth low (and was only .37 below the third low). This tells
us price is reaching the lowest levels in a long time but at a slower and
slowerrate.Bullishdivergencehadpresenteditselfandwarnedofapotential

In zone 2, price breaks above the downward sloping resistance line but
RSI fails at 60, the overbought level for a downtrend. In zone 3, price stays

moving average. The signal line is the 9-period exponential moving average
oftheMACD1line.Ifindthatveryfewpeopleactuallychangetheseperiods.
Hopefully this explanation will encourage you to experiment. In Chapter 2,
byJuliusdeKempenaer,you’llseethatheprefersthespreadbetweenthe10-
and 30-week moving averages. Interestingly enough, almost everyone seems
tokeepthesignalataperiodof9.
This produces an indicator that will oscillate between a positive and
negativevalue.Aruleofthumbformanyindicatorsisthatwhenthevalueof
alineinanindicatorturnspositive,itisbullish,andwhenitturnsnegative,it
isbearish.Asecondruleofthumbtoconsideristhatwhenafaster-movingline
(in this case the MACD1 line) crosses above a slower-moving line (signal),
a buy signal has occurred, and when a faster-moving line crosses below a
slower-moving line, a sell signal has occurred. Remember, these are rules of
thumb,notguarantees.
In Figure 1.13 there are two exponential moving averages on the price
chart.Thedashedlineisa12-dayaverageandthesolidlineisa26-dayaverage.
BelowthatistheMACDindicatorwheretheMACD1lineisdashedandthe
signallineissolid.Accordingtothelegends,theEMAVG(12)is70.315and
theEMAVG(26)is68.4248.The12-dayaverageminusthe26-dayaverage
equals 1.8902, which is equal to the MACD1 line in the bottom panel. If
the shorter-term average is less than the longer-term average, the MACD1
line value will be negative. If the shorter-term average is greater than the
longer-term average, the MACD1 line value will be positive. Therefore, the
MACD1 line is visualizing the crossing of the exponential moving averages
onthepricechart.
The other component of the MACD indicator is the signal line. This
line is plotted to trail or smooth the MACD1 line for two reasons. First, it
allowstheindicatortogenerateearliersignalsofapotentialchangeintrend.
ItprovidesearliersellsignalswhentheMACD1linecrossesbelowthesignal
line and earlier buy signals when the MACD1 line crosses above the signal
line. Considering where these crosses occur is important. The MACD1 line
crossing below the signal line while positive is an early sell signal. If the
MACD1linecrossesabovethesignallinewhilepositiveandfarfromthezero
line, a buy signal has not occurred because the trend is already very bullish.
Second,thesignallineconfirmsatrendchangewhenitturnsintoapositive
ornegativevalueaftertheMACD1lineturns.
Last, the slope of the MACD1 and signal line—positive, negative, or
transitioning—can have a bearing on the overall direction of trend. In sit-
uations shown in zone 2 of Figure 1.13, you’ll see how this can become
important.

In Figure 1.13, four zones have been highlighted to provide an example
ofhowtheindicatorworks.Inzone1,priceisinadowntrendasdefinedby
theresistanceofthedownward-slopingtrendlineandthe12-dayexponential
moving average. As price reaches lower lows in March 2009, MACD makes
higherlows.Thiscanbeconsideredbullishdivergence,aswediscussedinthe
RSI example. I find that fewer people consider divergence on MACD, but
I have come across some who do. In this instance, the divergence between
MACDandpricemeanstherollingspreadbetweenthetwomovingaverages

been concerned because price dipped below them and then they bearishly

TheMACD1linedidnotcrossthesignallineandithoveredat,andtojust

signal line maintained a bullish direction, or a positive slope. At the end of
zone2,thesignallineturnedpositive.
In zone 3, price had its first bearish signal in the uptrend, which is
representedbytheMACD1linecrossingbelowthesignalline.Fromzone3

In zone 4, the moving averages on price turned flat or sideways and the
MACD1 and signal line took a dive, coming very close to the baseline (or
zero). At this point we can still consider the trend as up. For it to continue,
we will need to see price close above prior highs of $74.22, and the MACD
linestobepointinghigher(positiveslope).Ifpricebreaksbelow$58.78,the

BollingerBands

or oversold markets. It does so by calculating a moving average of price
and measuring two standard deviations above and below it. The traditional
applicationwillmeasuretwostandarddeviationsaboveandbelowa20-period

bandsabout95percentofthetime.

The generally accepted signals are to sell if price closes above the upper
band (+2sd) and buy if price closes below the lower band (–2sd). In doing
so, a market participant expects price to revert to the mean, which is where
heorshewouldexitthetrade.
Because of the chosen method of calculating this study, the distance
betweenthebandswillvary.Narrowerbandssignifyalow-volatilitymarket,

the upper and lower deviation bands have been. The horizontal line drawn
on the bandwidth is an average of the bandwidth over that timeframe. This

to the mean, providing a gain of $0.67. This was an ideal situation to sell

oragreater-than-averagebandwidth,returns.
Inzone2,thereisanarrowpointingtoabarmarked“Sell?”Atthatpoint
in time, the bandwidth was very narrow. Since price was in an uptrend and
volatility declined, suggesting a pause or potential reversal in trend, it is not
advisable to sell because the profit opportunity is much less than the zone 1
examples because the moving average is closer to the deviation bands. The
next arrow in zone 2 says “Buy?” The same logic can be applied here. The

Toward the end of zone 2 is a second “Buy?” point. Once you see price

attempt to sell the riding of the lower band to profit from the continually

Stochastics

goalofthe+DMIand–DMIlines,whichrepresentupmovementanddown
movement, respectively. In theory, if the +DMI is greater than the –DMI,
it is bullish. If the –DMI is greater than the +DMI, it is bearish. We can’t
jumptotheseconclusions,however,untilweconsidertheaveragedirectional
movement (ADX).
Derived from the +DMI and –DMI lines, the ADX line suggests that
the market is trending in the direction of the greater DMI line if it is above
25.Ifitisbelow25,itsuggeststhatthetrendisweakorrangebound.Ifthe
ADX comes from 15 to 23, a trend could be developing. If the ADX goes
from32to25,thetrendmaybecomingtoanend.
Figure 1.16 displays the DMI and ADX indicator together. The solid
line is the +DMI, the dashed line is the –DMI line, and the thick dotted
line is the ADX. Prior to zone 1 there is a range-bound market as price was
not making consistently higher highs or lower lows and the ADX line was
below25.
Inzone1,pricedeclinedbelowtherange-boundlowsandadownward-
sloping trend line began. The –DMI continued to rise while the +DMI
continuedtofall.Thenattheendofzone1,theADXconfirmedadowntrend
inprogresswhenitrosefrom16toabove25.
In zone 2, price tested the downward-sloping resistance line and failed.
At the same time, the ADX line went below 25, suggesting that the prior
downtrendwasending(thisdoesnotnecessarilymeanreversing).
In zone 3, price broke above the trend line and the +DMI began rising
while the –DMI line was falling. Shortly thereafter, the ADX line crossed
above25,confirmingthetrendhadturnedtoup.

VolumeatTime
The last of the seven most popular studies is not applied to a price series of
a security, as the rest of the studies are. Volume at time (VAT), as the name

HistoricalVolumeatTime
The previous theory of volume can be applied to all timeframes. On a daily
chart, a moving average of volume can become unjustly skewed higher or
lower due to the volume that occurred over the duration of that average.
Theolderthatvolumebecomes,thelessinfluenceithasonestimatingtrend
direction. From a historical perspective, VAT considers the volume that has
occurredonthatdayoverthepastX yearstocreatetheaverageforthatday.
Therefore,itcanbeconsideredaseasonalapproachtovolumeanalysis.From
an intraday perspective, VAT creates an average of volume from the actual
volume that occurred during that time-slice for the past X days. In both
applicationsVATcanbeprojectedintothefuturetogetanideaofexpected
volume.
Figure 1.22 displays a daily chart of price and volume with a moving
averageandVATonthevolumehistogram.Therearefourzonesthathighlight
the benefits of using a time-sensitive study like VAT instead of a moving
average. In zone 1, price was declining. Volume, when compared to the
movingaverage,wasequaltoit,suggestingthemarketwasequallyinterested
in the down move. When compared to VAT, the actual volume was at least
50 percent greater and in some instances more than 100 percent greater.
VAT was suggesting the market was more bearish in the down move than
the moving average. More specifically, the first and second candle in zone 1
formed a bearish engulfing pattern on volume that was twice the VAT, but
only equal to the moving average. This is very important information for
thoseapplyingcandle-patterntheories.

comparing to actual volume. Price then attempted to reverse higher with
volume less than VAT and failed at resistance. The final bar had volume
greaterthanVAT,butpricestilldidn’tbreakresistanceanditwasadownday,
suggestingthatmarketparticipantswerestillbearish.
It is also worth knowing that VAT can anticipate future volume levels
because it can look historically to calculate those averages and plot them
into the future. In zone 4, VAT is showing the next two average volume
levels.
IntradayVolumeatTime
Intradayvolumeonacharttendstolooklikeasmile.Itistypicallyheavyatthe
open,lightinthemiddleoftheday,andheavyapproachingtheclose.When
you’re trading the open, a moving average is calculated from the prior day’s
closing volume. This is not an apples-to-apples comparison. It makes more
sensetocomparethevolumefromthepriormorning’sopentothismorning’s
open,thepriormidday’stradingtotoday’s,andthepriorend-of-day’strading
totoday’s.
VAT applied to an intraday chart is a time-sensitive average. It shows
you the average volume for a specific time-slice over the past X days. For
example, if you’re looking at a stock on a 10-minute chart with VAT set to
considerthepastfiveperiods,itwillshowyouthevolumeforeach10-minute
period and the average volume for that 10-minute period from the prior
X days. If you are looking at the 10:00–10:10 A.M. volume, the VAT level
is the sum of the volume for that same time period from the past X days,
dividedbyX.
The indicator will display a dashed line on the volume histogram that
represents the average volume level for that time-slice. It will also show a
second panel that totals the sum of the accumulated volume (AV, solid line)
andtheaccumulatedaveragevolume(AAV,dashedline)ontheday.
Figure 1.23 shows a three-day, 10-minute chart. During the first two
days when price gained 2.36 percent, it did so while AV was less than AAV.
Volume was not supporting this two-day rally. During the second day of
diverging price and volume, AAV was projected to be lower than the first
day. The AV was still less than AAV. In the middle panel, at the end of day
2, the last 70 minutes of trading, or seven bars, had about equal volume
but little to no price gains. The next morning, volume was greater than
VATandpricedeclined,kickingofftheretracement,withAVslightlygreater
thanAAV.

Conclusion
I encourage you to start looking at the indicators presented in this chapter
individuallyandthentogether.Onesuggestionforgettingstartedistoapply
two studies to a chart and look at different securities and timeframes to
become familiar with the movement of the indicators in response to price.
The following two figures are examples of combining one trending and one

your e-mail that determines whether the recipient is going to open the mail
at all, let alone read it. Or it could be your tone of voice when you leave a
voicemail or the way that you communicate your message when you get to

In the early 2000s, I was working as a technical analyst on the trading
floorofamidsizedinvestmentbankinAmsterdam.Myprimaryjobwasbeing
an analyst and producing technical reports for our institutional clients, and
itinvolvedalotofclientcontact.Iwasconfrontedwiththeissuesdescribed
above. Being the worst salesman in the business, I decided that my content
should be the “sizzle” factor. The content I identified to be of most use to
my clients was, and still is, Relative Strength Analysis. Over the years, the
methodsI’veusedtogivemyclientsthisinformationhaveevolvedintosome
uniqueapproaches,includingtheRelativeRotationGraph.
“This Time It’s Different”
Oneofthecornerstonesoftechnicalanalysisisthathistoryrepeatsitself.We
have seen that a lot of investors react to specific situations in a similar way.
They display the same characteristics over and over again, even if there are
generationsbetweentheoccurrencesofevents.Recalltheseimportantevents
infinancialhistory:
TheStockMarketCrashof1929
BlackMonday,October1987
TheRussianRubleCrisisof1998
TheDot-comBubbleof2000
TheCreditCrunchof2008
It is remarkable to see how similar the discussions and comments were
in the wake of these previous shocks. Perhaps the most-heard comment was
“This time it’s different.” Usually such a statement would be followed by a
discussion or explanation as to why the current crisis or shock could not be
comparedtoapreviousone.
Whensuchdiscussionsdevelop,Iusuallybringupthefollowingquote:
Today’s youth loves luxury. They are bad mannered, despise all authority,
shownorespectandtalkwhentheyshouldbeworking.Theyoungstersdo
notrisefromtheirseatswhenelderlypeopleenter,theygoagainsttheirpar-
ents,chatincompany,gobbledowntheirfoodandtyrannizetheirteachers.

Then I ask: “Do you subscribe to the statement?” followed by “Do you

Thepointis,mostofthetimethingsarenot different.Theymaylooka
littledifferentfromtheoutside,butattheendofthedayitishistoryrepeating

example. It comes from a 1934 edition of the Chicago Tribune and shows
strikingsimilaritieswiththe2008“creditcrunch”situation.
What Is Comparative Relative Strength?
Itdidnottakeverylongtofigureoutthatinstitutional(equity)investorshad
different needs from private investors. Obviously, the size of their portfolios
differshugely,butalsotheirinvestmentgoalsormandatesareabsolutelynot
comparable.Privateinvestors,99percentofthetime,arelookingforabsolute
return, whereas institutional investors, most of the time, are interested in
relativereturns.
Aprofessionalfundmanagertypicallyisgivenabenchmarkforaportfolio
and his or her job is to beat that benchmark. The portfolio manager who
oversees the European equity portfolio within a large institution has only
to beat the benchmark attached to that specific portfolio—for example, the
Euro STOXX 50 index. In a very large institution, they may even have a

Using any type of chart or combination of graphs, any technician can
come up with a more-or-less informed opinion on the equity market or the

only the question of whether to invest in that specific security. Viewing the

After a strong decline from mid-2007 into a low that was formed in
the beginning of 2009, the RS line started to move up, breaking the falling
trend lines and making higher highs and higher lows. That was enough to
indicate that equities were outperforming bonds again, therefore suggesting
apreferenceofequitiesoverbondsintheassetallocationofaportfolio.The
relative up-trend continued until the beginning of 2010, when the RS line
failedtosetanewhigherhighandthenbrokedownthroughtherisingtrend

The RS line can be drawn on different periodicities ranging from daily
to monthly, but also on intraday timeframes (5-minute periods, 10-minute
periods, hourly periods, etc.). During my career as a sell-side analyst, I pri-
marily used the weekly timeframe in my reports. I found that it suited the
longer time horizon of most institutions and showed less noise than a daily
timeframe.AlthoughIwillusuallyuseweeklygraphsintheexamples,please
bearinmindthatthemethodcanbeusedoneveryothertimeframeaswell.
Using a relative strength chart like the one in Figure 2.5 will help the
technical analyst to make an informed decision on the equity/bond choice.

and gauging the direction of “trend” remains a subjective call. In order to
overcome some of these issues, I reverted to the use of some “old friends” in
technical analysis, namely moving averages. Just as we use moving averages

Figure 2.8 shows the weekly bar chart of the S&P 500 Energy sector

RS line I have drawn two moving averages, one with a look-back period

of 10 weeks and one with a look-back period of 30 weeks. The crossings
of the two trigger a change in the trend of the RS line. When the 10-
week moving average is above the 30-week moving average, we rate the RS

line as being in an uptrend. When the 10-week moving average is below
the 30-week moving average, we rate the RS line as being in a downtrend.
This is the same application as applying moving averages to a price chart.
The only difference to keep in mind is that we are now looking at relative
movements. So when we have an RS line that is in an uptrend (10-week
above30-week),thenwecouldstillhaveasituationwherethesecurityweare
looking at is dropping but the benchmark, for example, the S&P index, is
droppingevenfaster.Althoughtheresultwillbenegativeinabsoluteterms,the
securityisoutperformingthebenchmark,andthatisexactlywhatprofessional
money managers are looking for. Clearly the reverse is true as well: When
the S&P index is rising, we are looking for sectors or stocks that are rising
evenfaster.
Interpreting the trend of the RS line on the basis of the position of
the moving averages takes a lot of the guesswork out of the analysis and
makes it less subjective. However, the use of moving averages, by definition,
introduces a lag. As a result, we can distinguish one more situation and that
iswhenthe10-weekmovingaveragehascrossedabovethe30-weekmoving
average, which signals an uptrend, but the raw RS line has already crossed
back below both the 10- and the 30-week moving average. Such a situation
will be seen as a warning signal that maybe something is cooking. So when

the 10-week average is still above the 30-week average, but the raw RS line
has dropped below both averages, the trend is rated neutral. The same goes
for the reverse when the 10-week average is below the 30-week average (a
downtrend), but the raw RS line has crossed above both of the moving
averages.
ThisisbetterillustratedinFigure2.9.Thisisthesameviewasshownin
Figure2.8,butzoomedinontheNovember2007toNovember2008period.
Up until August 2008, the 10-week moving average is clearly above the 30-
week moving average, indicating an uptrend, and thus an “outperformance”
condition for the Energy sector. At the first dashed vertical line, the RS line
dropsbelowbothmovingaverages,whilethe10-weekmovingaverageisstill

(somethingiscooking).AfewweekslaterinSeptember,attheseconddashed

Attheendofthe1990s,anumberoftheseRSlinesstartedtoovershoot

average of the MACD line (this timeframe can be varied). Therefore, in the

ThecrossingsoftheMACD-lineanditsowntrigger-linearethenusedasan

movingaveragesisshrinking.
With slight modification, this whole exercise can also be executed on a
raw RS line. I usually use a combination of the 10- and 30-period moving
averages on the raw RS line. If we draw a RS-MACD that looks at the
differencebetweenthe10-and30-periodmovingaveragesoftherawRSline,
we will get a line that oscillates around zero, indicating the strength of the
relative trend. The higher (or lower) the value of the RS-MACD line, the
strongerthetrendoftheunderlyingRSline.ThisRS-MACDlinewillthen
cross above and below the zero line, when the 10- and 30-period moving
averages in the RS-graph cross each other. To get early warning signals and
detectthepointintimewhenthedistancebetweenthetwomovingaverages
starts to decrease, a trigger-line (9-period moving average of the RS-MACD
line)isdrawn.AcrossingoftheRS-MACDlinebelowitstrigger-lineindicates
that the relative uptrend is losing momentum and turning the other way. A
crossingoftheRS-MACDlineaboveitstrigger-lineindicatesthattherelative
downtrendislosingmomentumandstartingtoturnaround.
Figure 2.10 shows the same chart as in Figure 2.9, but now the RS-
MACD has been added in the bottom pane. The rally from early 2007 into
mid-2008isagoodexampleofaverystrongmarketthatstartstoturn.Due
to the lag that’s introduced by using moving averages, the 10- and 30-week
averagesontheRSline(middlepaneinFigure2.10)wereveryfarapart.The
RS-MACD catches the deterioration in a very early stage by setting a peak
inmid-2008(seelabel1)andturningsharplydown,givinganearlywarning
signal that the relative outperformance of this sector might have come to an
end.BythetimetheaveragesontheRSlinearecrossingeachother(seelabel

This approach works well when only one item is analyzed against a
benchmark at a time. The numerical values of the raw RS line cannot be
used and have no real meaning. It is the slope of the line on the chart that
gives the clues. The numerical readings of one security against a benchmark
cannotbecompared withthenumerical readingsofanothersecurity against
the same benchmark. See the examples in the next two graphs. Figure 2.11

The JdK RS-Ratio and JdK RS-Momentum
Inordertobeabletocompareallelementsinauniverseandrankthembased
on their numerical readings—that is, high values are good and low values
are bad—we need something else. What we are looking for is a uniform
measure of relative strength that can be used across all the elements in a
universe against the benchmark for that universe, but also to measure the
relativestrengthofoneelementagainstanotherelement.Mysearchforsuch
∗
a measure resulted in the development of the (proprietary) JdK RS-Ratio.
This indicator measures the relative strength of all elements in a universe in
such a way that the numerical results are all comparable. Not only are the
valuesoftheJdKRS-Ratiotellingwhetheranelementoftheuniverseisdoing
betterthanthebenchmark,theyarealsotellingifanelementisdoingbetter
orworsethananotherelement.
The JdK RS-Ratio can therefore be used to rank a universe based on
relative strength and answer the question, “What are the five best sectors,
stocks,andsoforth?”(seeTable2.2).
Table2.2showsanexampleoftheSTOXXuniverserankedonthevalue
of the JdK RS-Ratio indicator. The differences are clearly visible. There is

How did that element get to its JdK RS-Ratio value and the accompanying

ordown?Toanswerthesequestions,weneedthegraphicalhistoryoftheJdK
RS-Ratio. Figure 2.13 shows the JdK RS-Ratio line of the European Retail

When we plot the JdK RS-Ratio below the price graph, it gives a pretty
goodindicationoftherelativestrengthofthesecuritybeinganalyzedagainst
its benchmark. The visual inspection of that line is as straightforward as the
interpretationoftherawrelativestrengthline;arisingJdKRS-Ratioisgood,
that is, the stock is “outperforming,” and a declining JdK RS-Ratio is bad,
that is, the stock is “underperforming.” Despite the fact that we can use the

for example, banks, against the appropriate sector index (the banking sector

interest-rate-relatedinstruments.Makesurethatallelementsareonthesame
footing; usually the best thing to do is to use fixed income (total return)
indicesinordertocomparethemagainstequities.
In my European Sector Report, I used the STOXX 600 universe and
presentedthechartsofall19sectorindiceswiththeirrelativestrengthagainst
the STOXX 600 index, with comments on their relative attractiveness and
expectations or the relative trends going forward. In the comments I high-
lighted some interesting equities that were showing strong relative pictures
against their sector index. In this way I wanted to present a top-down ap-
proach for fund managers. First I identified the sectors that were expected
tooutperform thegeneral index, andthenI selected individualequities that
were expected to outperform their sector index. The selection of individual
equitieswasalsodoneonsectorsthat,asawhole,wereshowingadowntrend
against the broader market. The rationale behind that is that a professional
fund manager who oversees a portfolio of European stocks is very unlikely
tohave,forexample,nobankingstockswhatsoeverinhisportfolio.Hemay
haveanunderweightingofbanksagainsttheweightofbankingstocksinthe
broader benchmark, but will rarely have none. So there is still a need for
some guidance toward which banking stocks to hold, even if the sector is
underperforming.
Afterputtingtogetherthereportonamonthlybasis,whichisfun,thehard

“significantoutperformancecomparedtothebenchmark.”Agoodstart,but
not good enough as it covered only four years of monthly data, that is, 48
observations. As the data for the indices used in the report (STOXX family)
wentbackto1987andthe“rules”togettotherecommendationswerefairly
clear,thenextstudyhedidwastotakethedatasetstartingin1987andrun
the rules to get the recommendations and evaluate the hypothetical results
again. Once again, the outcome of the test was that the results showed a

With that whole dataset and all the results (albeit, hypothetical results),

look at all the recommendations (1987–2003 = 16 × 12 = 192 months ×
18 sectors = 3,456) and see what the excess return compared to the bench-
mark was three months after the recommendation had been issued. The
result of that test was that both the outperformance and the underperfor-
mance recommendations, on average, generated an excess return. But what

So we moved from raw relative strength to two measures of relative

there is the JdK RS-Ratio that measures the relative strength of the secu-

600) followed by graphs of each individual sector with a pane showing JdK

Onceagain,thisprovedtobeanimprovementoftheformatasitanswered
a lot of questions beforehand that clients were going to pose. The problem
that persisted was that either the analyst who was going to give ideas to
the portfolio manager, or the portfolio manager himself, still had to browse

or stocks inside a sector were going to be good candidates to overweight or

Conclusion
The application of Relative Strength analysis through the use of RRGs can
aid investors at every level of the decision tree, from asset allocation to se-
lectionofindividualequities.Usuallythemoreactivetraderswilluseshorter
timeframes, whilelonger-term-orientedmarketparticipantswillwanttouse
weekly or even monthly timeframes. Fixed-income investors can use RRGs
todeterminewhichtype(governmentorcorporate),region,orcredit-levelto
pick,andatwhichpartofthecurve.ForextraderscanuseanRRGshowing
a number of currencies against a base currency to generate trade ideas. All
this can even be done on an intraday basis, for example, hourly or in 10-
minute periods. If you are connected to a real-time feed, this will generate
a very dynamic picture, showing real-time rotation during the course of the
tradingday.
Although RRGs are primarily used as a visualization tool, that does not
rule out using this method for more quantitative and rule-based approaches

Testing for a Valid Seasonal Cycle
The act of compositing historical data to create seasonal cycles is a process
that has been used for decades, going back at least as far as the cycles work
pioneeredbyEdwardR.Deweythatformallybeganin1941.
Seasonalcyclesarecyclesthattendtomoveinsimilarfashionsatspecific
times. They reflect fundamental factors that may or may not be known,
but they occur at regular intervals relative to the calendar year. This is an
extraordinary statement, because the fundamental proof of such seasonal
factorshasbeenelusive.Moreover,giventhattheeconomicfactorsthataffect
individual stocks, industries, and the overall economy are diverse, disparate,
andnonlinear,theidentificationofseasonalfactorsseemsproblematic.How
doyouknowthataseasonalcycleexistsifyoucan’tseewhyitexists?Taking
a composite of data as shown in Figure 3.1 is an insufficient process. One
can make a great-looking seasonal cycle out of random data, but there is no
reliabilityasthatcycleisprojectedintothefuture—thatis,itisinvalid.
Thetruthaboutseasonalcyclesisthatthevalidityoftheseasonalpattern
canvarygreatlyfromonesecuritytoanother.Moreover,agreat-lookingsea-
sonalcyclecanbemadefromrandomdata.Simplycompositingthedatainto
acycleasdisplayedinFigure3.1 isno guaranteethatanyseasonalinfluence
isbeingmeasured.PhilErlangerResearchhasintroducedtheconceptofvali-
datingseasonalcyclesthroughtheprocessoftestingexogenousdatasets.This
processiscalledtheCycle-R.
The idea behind validating a seasonal cycle is simple. Seasonal cycles
are valid if they reflect a meaningful seasonal influence. The rub is that,

for some stocks, there are no meaningful seasonal influences. Cycle-R is a
statistical correlation between seasonal cycles of a particular security derived
fromexogenousportionsofthatsecurity’shistoricalpricedata.
In Figure 3.2, a seasonal cycle has been created from a typical period
of historical data that spans the most recent complete 15 years of price data
forStarbucks(SBUX).ThiscyclewascreatedonNewYear’sDay,January1,
2010. In its standard form, it is etched in stone for the entire year of 2010
(there is an optimized form that will be discussed later in this chapter). The
unique nature of this indicator is that it is plotted so far in advance. But is
this a valid seasonal cycle? Is there a true seasonal influence being measured
bythispattern?

correlationbetweenthesetwoseasonalcycles.Correlationstatisticsaresimple
to read. Ranging from –1 to 1, a value of 1 is a perfect correlation, a value
of 0 is no correlation, and –1 is a perfectly inverse correlation. If the two
seasonalcyclesderivedfromexogenousdataaresignificantlycorrelated,then
there must be some measure of true seasonality that exists throughout the
data set. For Starbucks in the 15 years prior to 2010, the Cycle-R statistic
is 0.76—a high degree of correlation and, therefore, proof that the seasonal
cycleisavalidone.

As it turned out, Starbucks did move through 2010 in a fairly close
patterntoitsseasonalcycle.ThelowsintheseasonalcycleoflateJanuaryand
late August were closely matched to the lows in the actual price action (see
Figure 3.4). The weak period suggested by the seasonal cycle spanned from
late June through late August, and this turned out to be the weakest period
forStarbucksin2010.
It is important to note that seasonal cycles do not cause movements in
price action. The cycle simply reflects tendencies that are often a product of
fundamental influences applied at regular intervals or specific time periods.

calendaryearonadailybasis.
OptimizingforGreaterValidity
The determination of a Cycle-R statistic as a test of validity can be adjusted
by limiting the look-back period. In Figure 3.3 we used the standard look-
back length of 15 years (although a shorter timeframe can also be used).
The same test of validity can be performed on any look-back period from

as long as 15 years or as short as only two years. A two-year sample is not
particularly reliable because of the short time span, but the Erlanger Chart
Roomprogram(poweredbyBloomberg)canexecutetheCycle-Rprocesson
any user-selected look-back range of 15 years or less. Of the possible set of
look-back periods, slightly different seasonal cycles are created, each with its
ownparticularCycle-Rstatisticasatestofvalidity.
The key to optimizing the seasonal cycle is to select the look-back pe-
riod that maximizes the Cycle-R statistic. The largest Cycle-R statistic is so
measured because the exogenous seasonal cycles are most closely correlated,
therebyyieldingthemostvalidseasonalcycle.

respectable with a value of 0.54. The key point to this pattern is that the

andthatthestrengthinpriceremainsnearitshighatyear’send.

In Figure 3.6, American Express is shown with its optimized seasonal
cycle derived from a smaller span of the prior five years. This seasonal cycle
represents a much more “local” seasonal pattern. It is entirely possible that
seasonal factors can change as fundamentals change, or be transitory on
a multiyear scale, again as fundamentals change. For example, for American
Express,afinancialcompany,achangeintaxationcouldshiftseasonalfactors.
The Cycle-R test for validity is now a value of 0.66—a more valid statistic
thangeneratedbythestandardcorrelationtestoverthespanoftheprior15
years.Notethatintheoptimizedseasonalcycle,thepatternsuggeststhatthe
highperiodfortheyearoccursinlateApril/earlyMay,andthatthestrength

on January 1, 2010, and therefore the actual price action of 2010 is not a
factorintheirshape.The2010peakinpriceforAmericanExpressoccurred
in late April, and though price rallied in December, it fell off considerably,

Is the optimized seasonal cycle “better”? Not necessarily. Because the
optimized is a more local statistic, it is a trade-off in terms of offering a
pattern that is less “time tested.” Therefore, we suggest that both seasonal
patternsareofuse.Moreover,iftheybothsuggestastrongseasonaltendency

Every New Year’s Day, a fresh seasonal cycle is created by adding the

trend is imminent. Seasonality is a setup indicator. As stated previously,
seasonality does not cause price to move a certain way. It simply reflects
tendencies based on known or unknown fundamental factors. There can be
times when price action deviates from seasonal cycles, most often because
of exogenous factors that are of greater influence than the normal seasonal
influences.Forthesereasons,itiswisetoactonshiftsintheseasonalpatterns

Theoverallstrategyhasfourbasiccomponents:bias,setups,triggers,and

which side of a market to trade—long or short. As mentioned, setups are
technical patterns that suggest a change in price trend is imminent—a “get
ready to trade” type of indication. Triggers are indicators used to actually
execute opening and closing trades. To assess the effectiveness of a typical
plan using seasonality as a setup trigger, we examine the process in reverse,

the Cycle-R statistic for a particular security. If we eliminate those stocks of
the Dow 30 that have a Cycle-R less than zero, we get the results shown in

Erlanger Studies: The Art of the Squeeze Play
Fundamentalanalysis focusesontheeconomicconditionsthatcanaffectthe
valuation of a security. On the other hand, technical analysis is the study
of the market itself by examining the data generated by the action of a
security’s trading data or the data generated from the marketplace related to
thatsecurity.Fundamentalandtechnicalanalysesarecomplementarybecause
shifts in fundamental factors are ultimately behind the shifts in price that
are sought by the investor or trader. The technician, by focusing on the
marketplaceitself,makes it easier fortheinvestoror tradertodetermine if a
marketismovinginlinewith,orcontraryto,theknownfundamentals.
The Erlanger studies as provided by the Phil Erlanger Research are solely
technical in nature. That said, they are offered as an overall approach to in-
vestmentdecisionmaking.Theprocessofmakingintelligentinvestmentand
trading decisions is not always intuitive. The irony is that fundamental data
rarelyappearsidealwhensecuritypricesare“cheap.”Thepurposeoftechnical

Erlanger Studies are organized into what we call the art of the Squeeze

is that they are simple concepts, and if followed in order, they make up a

StrategicStep#1:DeterminingBias
Failing to determine bias is why most portfolio managers and traders go

The concept of bias is such a simple one, but it is the critical step that
most fail to consider. The chances of a positive long-term performance are

markettotrade.
We think of bias as the “big picture.” Is the condition of a market

The Erlanger Value Lines have another set of lines that we use for
bias—those opening range value lines. Traders often use the first-hour high
and first-hour low as support and resistance levels. If price breaks above the
first-hour high, the near-term bias turns positive. If price breaks below the
first-hourlow,thenear-termbiasturnsnegative.

The EROC also serves as a bias indicator. Figure 3.35 is a weekly chart
of the S&P 500 index with its weekly EROC. The “meaty” trend zones are
lightly shaded. If we trade the S&P 500 on a daily basis using the EROC,
it is logical to use the weekly EROC as a bias. This means that when the

weekly EROC is in a negative pattern, only short-sale triggers are taken on
a daily basis (buy signals are ignored). In Figure 3.34, those times when the
EROC fell below its signal line were not good times to sell short because
the bias of the weekly EROC was positive. When the weekly EROC is in a
positivepattern,onlybuytriggersaretakenonadailybasis(sell-shortsignals
areignored).
A similar scenario can be seen in Figure 3.36, an intraday chart of the
S&P 500 index. There were both buy and sell EROC trigger signals. Some
worked out well, others not so much. Because the bias (as measured by the
dailyEROC)happenedtobepositive,onlybuytriggersarecontemplated.
ErlangerNantucketSleighride
The Nantucket Sleighride (NS) is a set of three subindicators: the ENS, the
ENS Fast, and the ENS OB/OS. The ENS can act as a bias, setup, and
trigger indicator. It is a composite of very sensitive direction measures, and
itsnameisderivedfromitsaggressivenatureinfollowingatrend.Wherever
the “harpooned whale” goes, the user will be dragged, like the whalers on a
Nantucketsleighride,inthatdirection.
The idea behind the ENS is to highlight the meaty part of a trend as
soon as it unfolds (see Figure 3.37). For the ENS and ENS Fast, the meaty
partofthetrendishighlightedbythetimespentintheextremezones,which
aredelineatedbytheindicator’stimespentabove50(uptrend)orbelow–50
(downtrend). These are colored green and red, respectively. Once the ENS
rises above 50, an uptrend is considered to be underway. The meaty part of

the uptrend is complete when the ENS falls back below 50. Once the ENS
falls below –50, a downtrend is considered to be underway. The meaty part
ofthedowntrendiscompletewhentheENSmovesbackabove–50.
The ENS Fast indicator is designed to give the user an early indication
ofentryintothemeatyportionofatrend.Long-entry(short-exit)signalsare
consideredwiththefirstmoveabove50,withalong-exit(short-entry)atthe
firstmovebelow–50.
There is a third version of ENS, the ENS OB/OS indicator, which is
designedtoreflectoverboughtandoversoldlevelsinatrend.
The oversold moments of the ENS OB/OS indicator, like the one on
February 15 in Figure 3.38, is an important setup for an upside reversal of
trend. In Figure 3.38 the trigger for that upside reversal occurred late in
the day of February 15 when the ENS Fast indicator moved above 50 (the

The trigger mechanism in the Erlanger Crossover is a simple process of
buyingwhenthe“fast”line(plottedasasolidline)risesabovethe“slow”line
(plotted as a dashed line), and selling (or short selling) when the “fast” line
moves below the “slow” line. As is the case with all triggers, it is helpful to

When I was studying to become an engineer in 1969, I often used the

experiencewasthatlivechartingpackageswereabletoprogramonlypopular

thosethathadbecomeavailableonchartingpackages.
As computing power and bandwidth made increasingly demanding cal-
culations possible, the industry appeared to go down the road of handling
moredatainaclearerfashionbyusingmorecolorandmoreintensivedisplays.
The industry also became more sophisticated, with backtesting capabilities,

wasagapinprovidingtraderswithindicatorsbasedonrigorousmathematics
and statistics and the coding of complex patterns previously identified only
byeye,suchasmomentumdivergence,orformerlycalculatedanddrawnby
hand,suchasswings.
Itransferredfromengineeringtotradingin1983andbecameinterested
in technical analysis. I studied all the formulas behind the indicators so that
I would understand how they worked. It became clear to me over time, es-
pecially after being exposed to options mathematics and statistics when I
workedonaderivativesdesk,thatatraditionalapproachtotradingcouldbe
improved by changing the very simple math in standard indicators. It was
fromthatpointonthatthedevelopmentofKaseStatWare,asetofproprietary
tradeentry,exit,andriskmanagementstudies,began.TheindicatorsinKase
StatWareusemultiplecyclelengths,multiplebarlengths,statisticsandprob-
ability, complex pattern analysis, and similar approaches that make trading

composedofmathematicallyrigorous,semiautomatedindicators,Kaseusesa
traditionalapproachtotradingwithtechnicalindicators.Thisisasopposedto,
forexample,tradingbasedongeometricpatternssuchasflagsandpennants
or on wave counts. What I would consider a traditional approach would
be using trend identification indicators for entries (e.g., a moving average
or DMI), employing momentum divergence or ovebought/oversold signals
on indicators (e.g., the relative strength index, or RSI), and depending on
stochasticmethodscombinedwithtrailingstopsforexits.
Kase StatWare uses the familiar trade cycle of entering, placing stops,
thenexitingoneithermomentumorstophits,buthasreplacedtheoutdated

traderswhohavetypicallyusedthistypeofmethodology.

Next, some traders want to use traditional indicators but have found
themtoodifficulttointerpretortoocumbersometocombineinanintegrated
systematic manner. Kase’s semiautomation includes identifying buy and sell
signalswith“L”and“S”forlongandshort,anddisplayingthedivergencelines
on the screen for momentum indicators. Kase’s simplified indicator displays
eliminatemuchofthemanualinterpretationandsimplifyreadingandtrading
withcharts.
For engineers and for other traders who are intrigued by mathematics
and who wish to be confident about how an indicator works and what its
algorithms are doing, the appeal of Kase StatWare indicators is that they are
based on statistical and financial engineering principles. For example, rather
than basing momentum indicators on the rate of change between closes, or
wheretheclosemightlierelativetoahigh–lowrange,asdoRSIandstochastic
methods, the “guts” of Kase’s momentum indicators are based on the same
probabilitymathematicsasoptiontheory.
Whenever I recall the old days, when I used traditional indicators to
trade, I remember constantly tweaking my indicator parameters to better fit
marketconditions—forexample,usingashortperiodicity,suchasalengthof
nine,stochasticinsidewaysoroscillatingmarkets,andlongerperiodicitiesin
trendingmarkets,like21or34.AtthesametimeIhadtowatchoutforfalse
signals. For instance, if the market had been quiet and trading in a shallow
corrective pattern, and then experienced a volatile breakout, the stochastic
could display a drastic excursion into overbought or oversold territory that
was a result of a change in volatility and not a trend exhaustion. Kase’s
indicators are self-adjusting, optimizing each bar for volatility, cycle length,
andinsomecases,thevariationofvolatility,similartooptions’gamma.
Introduction to KaseSwing
ByKase’sdefinition,aswing isidenticaltowhatascientistwouldcallawave,
defined from peak to peak or valley to valley. Therefore, a wave would be
characterizedbythethreepointsofvalley-peak-valleyorpeak-valley-peak.In
themarketsthewordswing isordinarilyusedtodifferentiatescientificwaves
fromElliottwaves.Hereaswingisdefinedbythreeprices,x,y,andz,where
x andz areswinglows,withy representingaswinghighbetweenx andz,or
viceversa.ThisdiffersfromRalphNelsonElliott’sdefinitionofwave,which
isdescribedashalfandnotfullcyclesorswings.Thereforethetermswing is

All that is required to identify swings is to choose the peaks and valley
points, the swing highs and swing lows. At face value, this appears relatively

One way that φ, and φ(cid:2) can be found is by taking any two integers and
adding them together, then adding the sum with the second number and so
forth,asinXn=Xn−1+Xn−2.Inthiswayanumbersequenceisformed.
For example, the seed numbers could be 216 and 7. X is divided by
Xn − 1, such as 216/7, and the resultant value converges to phi, or 1.618.
Using 216 and 7, you will find that the 10th and 11th cells down the column
are4774and7729,with7729/4774,the10thratio,convergingto1.618.The
inverseratiois0.618.
Many technicians refer to φ, φ(cid:2) and other numbers relating to φ (such as
038, which is phi prime squared) as Fibonacci extensions, because they can be
derivedfromtheFibonaccisequence.TheFibonaccisequenceisonethatcanbe

UsingKaseSwinginForecasting
ApplicationsforKaseSwingthatmightbeimmediatelyobviousincludeusing
theswingsforwaveanalysisandforecasting.Forexample,theKaseSwingwith
labeled points, 77.09 − 87.23 − 83.82, projected to $97.83 as the “1.38”
extension, and the wave, 83.82 − 92.80 (9.48 in length) are about equal to
the wave 88.20 − 97.85 (9.43). This is one reason why the chart might be
labeledasanABC whereA∗ 1.38=C anda/C =c/C.Thisimpliesthatthe
portionwavestructuremightbecomplete.
In addition to this superficial wave count, an alternative interpretation
wouldhavetobetakenintoconsideration.Duringthemoveup,thecorrective
wavedown to 88.20 is larger than thecorrective waveto 83.82.This means
thatthecasecanbemadeforittobelabeledBinstead.Herethemajorswingis
77.09−92.80−88.20.Thiswaveprojectsto97.90asthe“0.62”extension.
Thesefactors(thelargecorrectionandthefactthatakeywaveprojectionwas
met) along with the fact that the swing 3 held above $88.20 supersede the
firstcount.
Inadditiontohelpinganalyzeexistingmarketactivity,thelabeledswings
can facilitate estimating future prices. To continue the simplified example,
the two swings noted above from 77.09 project to a price just above $100,
the first as the “1.62” extension, and the second as the “1.38.” So the next

Prices actually reached $99.29, failed at $99.11 on a second attempt to
moveup,thendroppedquicklybyapproximately$14to$85.82.Therefore,
when prices dropped below the $96.16 swing low, a sell signal would have
beengenerated.
This is the type of analysis done in actual forecasting. However, in that
context, instead of identifying three or four swings, identifying 50 to 100
swingsonmanychartsfrommonthlydowntomaybe15-minuteiscommon.
KaseSwing helps to identify all the appropriate swings as well as the pricing
pointsthatdefinethem.

Even though defining swings might seem straightforward, it’s clear that
drawing in the swings and labeling all of them can be tedious. In addition,
inreal-lifesituationsit’sevenmorecomplex.Inreality,specialsituationsexist

If so, there are eight combinations of conditions that have to be

KaseSwinghasavariablethatallowstheusertochoosewhethertoconsider

Figure4.7showsCLK10(May2010CrudeOilContract)ona30-minute

and the middle swing high between the two swing lows is 83.49. When the

pertheuparrow(1),andastopplacedat83.14.Whenthemarkethit83.14,
thetradewouldhavebeenexitedperthedownarrow(2).
Following this a new, lower swing low was made at 83.12. So the move
up from that lower swing low would then have been counted as a new, first
swing. A second swing and outside bar formed up from 83.22 (arrow 3), so
when there was a close over 83.40, a long trade may have been taken with
a stop placed at 83.22. Once a new higher swing low of 83.30 was made,
the stop would have been moved up to that level and then, following the
83.35, moved again, this time to 83.35. Finally, when the 83.35 swing low
wasbroken,thetradewouldhavebeenexited(arrow4).
In the next example, shown on a daily cotton continuation chart,

However, the need to adjust for large swings is one reason why the Kase

Kase DevStops
The Kase DevStops are based on volatility, using TrueRange as a proxy, and
haveanumberoffeaturesnotavailablewithaswingsystem.
TrailingStops
Figure4.9showsKaseDevStopsbasedonthesamedataasinFigure4.8,which
uses swing stops. The first difference that can be seen is that the DevStop is
a trailing stop. This means that with long trades, the stop trails below the
market and follows the highest high that takes place during the trade. With
shorttrades,thestoptrailsabovethemarketandfollowsthelowestlow.

So a fixed-value stop that is used under all conditions doesn’t work. A proxy

the multipliers are only reasonable guesses. Second, multipliers that would

Only one more adjustment was necessary. Returning to the green bean ex-
ample, it is not possible for green beans to exist that are zero or fewer in-
ches long; however, even the grower whose largest beans were about 5.2
inches long would occasionally grow a freak 8-inch green bean. In other

AmountsCalculable
Given the basis of Kase DevStops, they are logical, and because the stops
are based on defined math and statistics, they are easily calculable; thus
their amounts can be estimated in advance for risk assessment purposes.
The risk amounts associated with each stop are available within StatWare as

In addition, the results can be clarified further by looking at a higher
time frame—for example, daily stops versus weekly stops—when moving
averages are crossed in the same or opposite directions, and when there is a
match between daily and weekly stops, such as Dev3 on the daily matching
with Dev1 on the weekly stop. Used in this way, the DevStops becomes a

Kase Momentum Divergence Algorithm
Amajorsignalthatisusedforexitsis“momentumdivergence,”andalongthe
same lines a key danger sign is a momentum divergence setup. Momentum
divergence is defined as an equal or higher high in price accompanied by
a lower or equal high in momentum, or an equal or lower low in price
accompanied by an equal or higher low in momentum. The latter would
strictly be called convergence, but the word divergence is generally used for
bothintechnicalanalysis.

bars, then the bar length might be too low. In any case, KaseMDA properly
counts tolerance bars and considers plateaus when defining swing highs
andlows.
NullDivergence
Whenever a peak in momentum precedes a peak in price there is a risk that
thedivergencewillbenullifiedbeforeconfirming.Lookingagainatarrow1a
on Figure 4.12, the peak on momentum came one bar early; thus while the
price was in the process of forming its peak one bar later, the momentum
indicatorcouldhaveturnedbackupandrisenaboveitsprevioushigh,which
ismarkedbythehorizontaldashedline.Ifthathadhappened,thedivergence
wouldhavebeeninvalidor“null.”Thesameprincipleistrueinreverse,that
is, in the case when the price peaks one bar early. As the momentum peak
forms,itmaybeinvalidatedbythepricefallingbelowthesecondswinglow.
Nowlet’slookatFigure4.14,whichshowsanexampleofnulldivergence.
As noted by the first arrow 1, on July 1, the first valid momentum low peak
was one bar after the price low peak and formed a valid price/momentum
pair. On July 13, a valid price low took place, arrow 2, followed by a low in
momentum the following day. There must always be a bar following a low
orhightoshowthatitwasactuallyapeak(asopposedtoanewloworhigh
following the bar tentatively thought to be a peak). Thus, on July 15 as the
momentum turned higher, which confirmed the low peak in momentum,
pricesmakeanewlow(seearrow3),invalidatingthepreviouspricelowand
nullifying a divergence, which would have been drawn to the July 13 price
andJuly14momentumlows,asshown.

Sowhenthinkingabouttrend,similarlogiccanbeusedtoseeifamarket
is trending or not. The challenge is that a simple analysis of price relative to
standard deviation ofprice, such as thosecaptured byBollingerBands, does
not providethis measurement. The proper measure of standard deviation of
price that actually is relevant is related to volatility. For the Kase DevStops,
alinearmeasureofvolatility,TrueRange,wasused.FortheKPOandKCD,
math from the actual Black formula is used, where volatility is the standard
deviationofthelogarithmicrateofchangeinpriceoveracertainnumberof

The measure of a trend’s statistical significance is the Kase Serial De-
pendency Index, or KSDI. The market’s trendiness up, the KSDIup, is its
logarithmic rate of change from the low n days ago to the high this bar,
divided by the volatility, which yields the number of standard deviations or

AdaptedtoVariableCycleLengths
Theuseofmultiplecyclelengthsinmomentumindicatorsisnotnew.Inthe
1980s, Larry Williams introduced his Ultimate Oscillator, which uses three
differentcyclelengthsratherthanjustonecyclelengthandisnormalizedfor
TrueRange.However,ascomputingpowerhasimproved,it’spossiblenowto
optimizecyclelengthsoverwiderangesratherthanjustusingmultiplestatic
periods, to do so separately for upward versus downward moves, and to use
Black’slogarithmicallybasedvolatilityratherthanlinearTrueRange.
Duringanygivenperiod,thedurationofupordownmovesinthemarket
varies, and over the same date range, up move lengths can differ from down
movelengths.Thus,fixedvalueindicatorsorevenlimitedadaptiveindicators
thatusethesamelengthforupanddownmovesareinadequate,becausecycle

bedifferent.
Thus,KSDIupfindsthesignificantcyclelengthforupmovesandKSDI-
down for down moves, each independently selecting the KSDI value based
onthenumberofbarsthatreturnsthehighestvalueforeitherdirection.
TheStudies
Once the most significant KSDIup and KSDIdown values have been cal-
culated, the KPO and KCD may be calculated. For KPO and KCD, the
KSDIupandKSDIdowntaketheplaceofthemovingaveragesusedintradi-

points. Thus, rather than moving into a nebulous overbought or oversold
condition, each indicator isolates exact histogram points where peaks might
be taking place. In a sense, the math in the KPO and KCD can be thought
ofasforcingthehistogramtowardapeak,asillustratedinFigure4.17.
In addition, because KPO and KCD are normalized, their values are
significant regardless as to instrument, bar length, and other market con-
ditions. Thus, defining OBOS can be done precisely for both the KPO
andKCD.
HowPeaksAreDisplayed
Momentum indicators provide measurements as to when an instrument is
overbought or oversold. This is valuable information, but one of the pitfalls
to using overbought and oversold conditions is that traditional momentum
indicators fail to pinpoint turning points. They can also remain overbought
or oversold for long periods of time. To address these issues, the KPO and
KCD studies use techniques to match price peaks with momentum peaks
topinpointoverboughtandoversoldsignals.TheseOBOSsignalsarecalled
PeakOutsontheKPOandKCDpeaksontheKCD.
The KPO’s PeakOut condition is defined by the lesser of a fixed value
at 100 for overbought conditions and −100 for oversold conditions, or two
standard deviations of the momentum value over a range of bars, and dis-
playedasasolidline,calledthePeakOutline,aboveorbelowthehistogram’s
zero line. The fixed values of +/− 100 were derived from a study that ex-
amined 80 years of PeakOscillator values and represents the 90th percentile
historically.
When the momentum histogram peaks above or below a PeakOut line,
the KPO then attempts to match the histogram peak with a peak in price
within a three-bar tolerance, similar to the matching explained relative to
divergence.Ifthemomentumandpricepeaksmatchwithinthetolerance,a
PeakOutsignalistriggeredandlabeledonthechartasa“P.”
TheKCDdefinesitsoverbought/oversoldthresholdusing1.75standard
deviationsofitsvalueoverarangeofbars.Ratherthandrawingalineonthe
oscillator to define the KCDpeak condition, the KCD histogram bars turn
a different color (appearing as a shade of gray in the figures in this chapter)
when they move above (for positive momentum) or below (for negative
momentum) this threshold. Peaks in the KCD that meet the OBOS criteria
arethenmatchedagainstpricepeakswithinatolerance.IftheKCDandprice

OBOSSignalUsable
Figure 4.17 shows a daily continuation cotton chart, where the stochastic
began to rise in mid-May and did not fall out of overbought until mid-July,
well after prices had turned down. Also, during this time at least four false
divergencestookplace,asmarkedontheindicatoritself.
TheKPOdidnotriseintopotentialoverboughtterritoryuntilearlyJuly,
and then generated three PeakOut signals as shown. Usually, in a trending
market the first PeakOut is not significant, so stops might have been pulled
intoDev1untilthepricepeakwasexceeded.ThesecondPeakOuttookplace
onJuly10,atwhichpointthestopsmighthavebeenpulledintothewarning
line, and in which case the stops held. The stochastic remained overbought
anddidnotgeneratesignalsatthispoint.
FinallyathirdPeakOuttookplaceonJuly16onapricepeakthatwaspart
ofatextbookHaramilineandstar.Here,theopenoftheHaramiline,which
was slightly above the warning line, might have been used as an accelerated
exit. Thus, the exit might have taken place at 66.7 upon the following
day’s open. Once more, the Stochastic missed the signal, and did not exit
the overbought zone until much later, when prices had already fallen to
about64.5.
AdditionalReasons—BetterPerformance
BoththeKaseindicators,theKPOandKCD,aswellastraditionalindicators,
hit the warning line just under 90 percent of the time, but when looked at
based on other dimensions, the KPO and KCD can be seen to be more
effectivethanotherindicators.
Ratherthanlookingforwardtoseewhathappensafterasignalisgener-
ated,stopscanbeevaluatedtofindoutiftherewasawarningaheadoftime,
intheformofamomentumdivergencesignalorsetup.
Although momentum indicators average over a 70 percent success rate
in hitting Dev1 after a signal is generated, stops may often be hit without a
prior signal. Sometimes a signal is generated before a turn, and sometimes
not. When a momentum signal fails to take place before a turn, the market
mayturnandtradesmaybestoppedoutwithoutwarning.Also,whentrades
are missed, sometimes large turns are missed and at other times only small

Kase Permission Stochastic and Screen
Trades taken in the direction of a major trend tend to be more successful
than trades against the trend. This is because market moves are more or less
structurally similar regardless of timeframe. If the trend is not confirmed on
the longer bar length, then the move on the shorter bar length may be only
noise or a minor fluctuation within the larger timeframe. Thus, it’s good
practicetoscreentradeswithalongerbarlengthfilter.
The challenge of using longer bar lengths to confirm signals is that of
waiting for the longer timeframe to confirm: for example, waiting until the
endoftheweekforaweeklytoconfirmadaily,ortotheendofanhourfor
an hourly to confirm a 10-minute chart. Other complications are that most
chartingsystemsdon’tallowforsettingupdailychartsinotherthanmultiples
offive—thatis,weekly—soscreeningadailywithathree-dayisnotpossible.
Also, sometimes it is not possible to chart two bar lengths such as a 55-tick
anda144-tickonthesamechart.
As an example of having to wait for a longer timeframe to confirm, if
Slow Stochastic crossovers were being used as entry signals on a daily chart,
a weeklywould beused for afilter. Thus a trader receiving a signal ona day
otherthanFridaywouldhavetowaitonetofivedaysforaconfirmingsignal.

To address the shortcomings of using a fixed higher bar length filter,
the Kase Permission Stochastic was developed. The idea behind the Kase
Permission Stochastic was to build “synthetic bars” and create longer bar
lengthsfromthebarlengthbeingtraded.



==================================================
                     PAGE 212                     
==================================================

KaseStatWareTMandStudies 201
The Permission Stochastic uses a multiple of lower bar lengths to create
the synthetic longer bar lengths. For instance, in the example in which the
traderwantedaweeklystochastictofilteradailychart,fivedailybarsending
withthecurrentdaywouldbeusedtosynthesizeaweeklybar.Inotherwords,
the Kase Permission Stochastic viewed on Tuesday comprises data from the
previous week’s Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, as well as the current
week’s Monday and Tuesday, using Wednesday’s open, Tuesday’s close, and
themaximumhighandminimumlowofallfivedays.
TheSlowStochasticformulaisthenappliedtothesyntheticbarstocreate
the Kase Permission Stochastic. On average, crossovers take place about two
bars earlier when using the Kase Permission Stochastic; this allows for filters
that are both efficient and conservative. It also allows for filters in multiples
ofotherthanfive,suchasathree-oreight-dayfilter.
Figure 4.23 shows the same data as in Figure 4.22; however, here Kase
PermissionStochasticpermissionedthelongtradeonOctober12,fourdays

2. ConservativeEntries
There are two basic indications that Kase uses to ensure that the
momentum signals are validated: (1) higher timeframe filters, and (2)
patterns.
(cid:2)
Signals may be validated using a higher timeframe or bar length (the
PermissionScreen),withthepreferredhighertimeframethreetimesthe
underlying—forexample,a45-minutefilterwitha15-minutechart,or
a60-centKaseBarwitha20-centKaseBar.
(cid:2)
Theothervalidationthatcanbesubstitutedforalongerbarlengthfilter
isthatofapatternfilter—forexample,intheabsenceofa“permission”
from the filter, for a long signal tone a valid pattern is two rising bars,
thesecondofwhichmusthaveanupclose,andviceversa.
3. ConfirmedEntries
A confirmed entry is one that follows an initial entry signal with a
confirmingsignalafterapullbackinprice.
(cid:2)
A second or consecutive entry confirms a first signal. If a signal is false
or would lead to a whipsaw, it often won’t be confirmed. A second or
consecutivebuyisonethatfollows(oriscoincidentwith,inthecaseof
outside bars) a swing low that is equal to or higher than the swing low
thatisassociatedwithanearlierbuysignal,andviceversa.
(cid:2)
The other type of entry that can be used if a first signal only has been
generated is to evaluate where the market is, based on DevStops, and
to scale in per the related probabilities based on closes above or below
certain stops. In this case, the hitting of the DevStops confirms the
validityofthefirstsignal.
UsingTraditionalEntries
Let’sassumethefollowingfourrulesaretobeusedwithastandardtraditional
indicatorsystem:
1. On the timeframe to be traded, two out of three momentum indicators
mustbecrossedinthedirectionofthetrade.Forpurposesofthisexample,

2. Ahighertimeframefiltermustofferpermissioninthesamedirection,and
there must be at least one bar in the direction of the cross (down or up),
with the most recent closing in that direction. In this example, a slow
stochasticisused.
3. On the higher timeframe, if the filter grants the opposite permissioning
status, there must be at least two bars in the direction of the crossover

example,aslowstochasticisused.
4. Takeonlysecondandconsecutivesignalsfollowingapullback.
First,atradingchartmustbesetup,inthisexample,CVXdailycandle-
sticksinearly2010,withthestochastic,RSIwithaverage,andMACD.The

viewthestatusofCVXonathree-daybarchart,thisisnotpossibleinmost
chartingsystems.Thusaweeklychartmustbeused.Thesecondchartshows
aweeklyCVXwiththeslowstochastic.(SeeFigure4.24.)
MultipleBasicSignals
Commencing with the swing high on January 11, a search for short signals
following the high might begin, with a focus on whether at least two of
three momentum indicators have crossed to the downside. The MACD is
positive and has not crossed to the downside, but it’s not clear just glancing
atthechartwhentheRSIwithaverageandtheslowstochastichavecrossed.
Eachindicatormustbemeasured,withthefindingthattheycrossedbetween
January 12 and Jan 13, respectively. Having to check the status of three
momentum indicators on an ongoing basis on one daily chart might not be
overly time consuming, but doing so on many charts, or on intraday charts
canbecomeoverlytaxing.
ConservativeEntries
After seeing that the momentum indicators have crossed by January 13, a
weeklychartwouldhavetobecheckedtoascertainthestatusofthefilter.As
ofthepreviousFriday,thestatusoftheweeklyslowstochasticwaslong;that
is, both the K and D lines were in the middle of the chart and the K was
above the D. That isn’t always the case, so in addition to having to switch
back and forth between charts, using the cursor to evaluate the status of the
stochastic is sometimes necessary. This may not be onerous when trading a
daily/weeklycombination;however, whentradingshorter term, such as a5-
or 15-minute combination, it might become tedious, or even impossible to
keepup.
Since the daily chart is in a “permission short” status and the weekly is
not, the pattern of the bars must now be checked. The candlesticks indicate
thatJanuary13wasadaywithadownclose,butit’snotclearfromglancingat

The chart shows that January 15 might qualify as a second sell signal,
similar to the first. However, the status of the MACD is hard to determine
visually, so the MACD’s value on that day would have to be measured. It
turnsoutthattheMACDis−0.09atthatpoint.So,onJanuary15,asecond

About the Kase Easy Entry System
The Kase Easy Entry System (KEES) condenses all of the rules set forth in
previoussectionsintosimpleS’sfor“short”andL’sfor“long.”KEESusesrules
similartothosedescribedabove,butwithspecializedindicators.FortheRSI,
Kase uses a proprietary “double Fibonacci” version. For the stochastic, Kase
uses a proprietary stabilized version that has fewer whipsaw crossovers, the
Kase Stabilized Stochastic. Instead of the MACD, Kase uses the KCD with
settings designed to emulate the MACD more closely, but with the KCD
advantagesdescribedearlier.
Inaddition,becausetheKasePermissionStochasticisbuiltusingasyn-
theticbarinthebackground,it’spossibletodeviatefromasettingof5,such
as would be necessary with a daily/weekly combination. Kase’s research has
indicatedthatusingasettingof3,thatis,abarlengththreetimeshigherthan
thatbeingtraded,isoptimal.InKEES,theoptimalsettingforfilteringisused.

additional one-third might be exited on the second and third S sell signals

Upon the short exit described in the trading explanation, one-third of
the position might be added back, and then another two-thirdson the valid

Kase Bar Chart (Equal TrueRange Bar Chart)
KaseBarsaremeanttobeequalTrueRangebars.TheKaseBarmethodcreates

Kase Bars are built using either ticks, which is ideal, or small time in-
crements, such as one-minute bars. As the tick or time data are read in, the
TrueRange of the current bar is incrementally measured. Once the target is

KaseBarsimproveupontraditionalbartypessuchasminuteandconstant

Technical Analysis Is Simple in Theory—Difficult
in Practice
Ask almost anyone, “What can a market do?” and you’ll most often hear,
“Marketscanonlymoveup,down,orsideways.”Inteachingtechnicalanal-
ysis to market professionals worldwide, we further simplify this by saying
that market movements are displayed in charts in only one of two mutually
exclusivephases:horizontalandvertical.
Markets move either horizontally through time—or vertically through
price(upordown)—butneverbothsimultaneouslylikeinFigures5.1and5.2.
Yet,assimpleasthisis,oneofthemostcommonsourcesoftradinglosses—and
therefore among the greatest risks to traders and market participants—is
simply being on the wrong side of a market that’s rapidly moving higher
or lower through vertical price levels. It is a market that is already moving
vertically and fast through price while seeking supply at higher and higher
pricelevels—oronethatisunloadingsupplyatlowerandlowerpricelevels.
Basically,itisaninterimtrendingmarketversusanontrendingmarket.

We know for certain that there are no certainties in the market, only
probabilities. And we can use simple probability concepts to enhance our
trading. For example, we can say that when a market is in an uptrend, the
lower-probabilitytradewouldbetostayawayfromtheshortside.Atapurely

possible high-probability trade starts with the mind-set and very basic rules
of:Inanuptrend,don’tbeshort;inadowntrend,don’tbelong.”
Insequence,thethreerulesareactuallythissimple:
1. Determinewhichsideofthemarkethasaverylowornear-zerochanceof

2. Eliminatethatsideofthemarketfromconsideration.
3. From the remaining two sides, start looking for entries and if none are

We cantakethis one step further and narrow thepossibilities to asingle

Discretionary traders have more than just their perceptual blindness to
overcome. They have dozens and dozens of human factors to contend with
that automated strategy trading simply doesn’t face, such as those listed in
Figure5.3.
On the other hand, our minds have an amazing power to help us bring

And most important, the computers running automated trading systems
don’t question rules or develop biases of their own: they simply do what
they are instructed to do—which is a characteristic desired by all market
participants.
Our experience inproptradingshows us thatsimplifying the process of
turningmassiveamountsoftradingdataintosimple,rules-based,actionable
information allows market participants to focus on what matters most. We
breakthisinformationintothreecategories:
1. The past: A clear distillation and read of the past and how price, and
thereforetraders,respondtokeyareasinthechart.
2. The present: Insight into the immediate present and what price is trying
to do (go higher, lower, stall, etc.), and whether it is succeeding at doing
that.
3. Thefuture:Aglimpseintohigh-probabilitypricemovementsandscenar-

Balance versus Imbalance: Distinguishing the Two
Phases of Market Activity
OurtrainingmethodologyatTASProfessionalstartswithaverybasicpremise:
markets are very simple in the sense that they have only two repeatable but
mutually exclusive price movements in any particular timeframe: horizontal
andvertical(seeFigure5.4and5.5).

These horizontal and vertical market components are the “building
blocks” of all markets. They are building blocks in the sense that, because
thetwophasesaremutuallyexclusive,whenamarketistradinginoneofthe
phases, we know what’s next: the other phase. We say that balance leads to
imbalance—and back to balance again. We know that a slow, low-volatility,
horizontal movement will be followed by a relatively fast, higher volatility,
verticalmovement,andthatafast,higher-volatility,verticalmarketwilleven-
tuallyleadbacktoaslower,horizontalmarket.
There Are Only Three Market Segments: Nontrending,
Uptrending, and Downtrending
All markets are composed of three technical components: nontrending, up-
trending,anddowntrendingsegments.Eachsegmenthasaspecificdefinition
and specific trading tactics. In a simple sense, properly identifying the seg-
ment,thenapplyingthepropertradingoranalysistechniquesonthesegment,

The formal definition of an uptrend is a market that is exhibiting a series
(two or more) of higher price pivot lows and higher price pivot highs (see

But if we are looking to get long a market and wait for the market to
actually exhibit an uptrend, we will have often missed the lower volatility,
lower-risk trading opportunity by the time the uptrend fits the formal defi-
nition.Remember,tobeconsideredanuptrend,weneedatleasttwohigher

often get only what we are looking for, so if we are looking for uptrends to
getlong,manythingslooklikeanuptrendbutmayinfactnotfittheformal

We resolve these issues with a simple logic premise: rather than look
for the beginnings of or confirmation of a new phase, we look for clues
that a current stage is coming to an end. For example, rather than look
for the beginning clues of an uptrend or a much later (and higher-priced)
confirmationofanuptrend,weteachourtraderstolookforthepotentialend

to move from our line-chart illustrations to bar charts for the moment. In

As the horizontal formation develops sideways, competition among the
four participants increases: both professional buyers and sellers are entering
sooner and sooner at higher and lower prices, respectively. And both novice
buyers’ and sellers’ hopes are increasing over time because of the amount of
time they had to endure after buying price pivot highs in a range, only to
watch the market immediately go lower—or shorting price pivot lows in a
range,onlytowatchthemarketimmediatelygohigher.

because profile data is not constricted to fixed time increment bars, Market
Profile allows market professionals to organize the data and study a market
basedonmarketstructureanddynamics.
Classic Market Profile organizes trading data using letters called TPOs
(Time Price Opportunities—or “That Price Occurred”) to mark each price
whereatradeoccurred.Eachconsecutiveletterofthealphabetdemarcatesa
30-minuteperiodofmarketactivity.Forexample,theletter“B”markedthe

prices,whichiskeytodeterminingprobability.

Market Movement: The Four Steps of Market Activity
In the early 1990s, Pete Steidlmayer coined the concept of the Four Steps
of Market Activity. The Four Steps are an ongoing process that markets go
through to factor out inefficiencies. Inefficiencies are the market imbalance
phases where the market moves directionally higher or lower to seek out a
newfairpricetotrade,thatis,wherethemarketmovesbacktobalance.
The Four Steps concept was based on Steidlmayer’s research of how
marketsmoveinasequenceofstepsastheyseekoutanefficientpricewhere

The Relative Speed of the Market’s
Building-Block Components
There are four basic guidelines for assembling and then observing these two
marketcomponents:
1. Fastverticalmarketmovementsfollowslowhorizontalmarketmovements.

Vertical Nondevelopment (“Minus Development”)
We’ve taken a look at horizontal development in detail. Let’s now exam-
ine what happens in the absence of horizontal development by referring to
Figure5.16.

timeandproducesabalancedprofile.

A key feature in profiles during vertical moves is the lack of horizontal
development—or “minus development,” a term coined by Pete Steidlmayer.

Trading vertical moves into holes has higher reward-to-risk factors than
tradinghorizontalmovesofthesamesecurityandtimeframe—provided,of
course,thatatraderisontherightsideofthemovement.
In profile terms, profiles are either relatively fat, representing horizontal
development—or they’re relatively skinny, representing vertical movement.
Between the horizontally developed fat profiles, markets move fast vertically
andit’sintheverticalmovesthatmarketprofessionalswillfindgreaterpoint
moves than in the horizontal. Therefore, where a market has a high prob-
ability of moving faster and the speed at which price has the potential to
traverse a range are critical distinctions for market professionals to take into
consideration.

AtTASProfessional,weinstinctivelyknewyearsagothatclassicMarket

But one of the challenges inherent in classic Market Profile was the steep
learningcurveassociatedwithgleaningtherightinformationfromtheprofiles.
And there was an additional subjectivity in its interpretation that left us
wondering:IsthereabetterwaytousethecoreconceptsofAuctionMarket

It was the need to overcome these inherent challenges that lead us to
develop the TAS PRO Indicator SuiteTM of trading tools. After seven years

DynamicVAPApplications
Dynamic VAP helps eliminate a lot of the guesswork and subjectivity that
goesintoentering,managing,andexitingtrades.Forexample:
(cid:2)
If we are long above a Dynamic VAP profile, then our stop is below the
profile—andvice-versaforshorts.Thereasoningbehindthisisthattheareas
above and below Dynamic VAP profiles are essentially holes. As we’ve
discussed, the expectation for price trading into holes is that there will
be high-probability follow-through and, if not, then the probe higher is
rejectedfairlyquicklyforaquick-and-tightstopout.
(cid:2)
DynamicVAPisaneffectivetrademanagementtoolandformsthebasisfor
our rules-based trading approach. For example, a break above a Dynamic
VAPprofiletellsus:(a)don’tbeshort;(b)getlongorbelong;and(c)hold
thetradeaslongaspricetradesaboveconsecutivelyhigherprofiles—orexit
thetradewhenpricetradesintoorbelowthenextDynamicVAPprofile.
(cid:2)
When price is bracketed inside a Dynamic VAP profile, the top line is
considered a supply area (resistance) and the bottom line is considered a
demandarea(support).
(cid:2)
When price moves outside the top of a Dynamic VAP profile, then (a) a
breakouthasoccurred,(b)themarketbiasisdirectionaltotheupside,and
(c) the relative vertical speed of movement through price levels will likely
increase.
(cid:2)
WhenpricemovesoutsidethebottomofaDynamicVAPprofile,then(a)a
breakdownhasoccurred,(b)themarketbiasisdirectionaltothedownside,
and (c) the relative vertical speed of movement through price levels will
likelyincrease.
(cid:2)
When breakouts and breakdowns occur above and below Dynamic VAP
profiles,thereisahighprobabilitythatthenewdirectionalmovewillremain
intactuntilanewDynamicVAPprofileoccurs.
(cid:2)
Previous Dynamic VAP profiles to the left in the chart are support or
resistance areas where the market will either pause and reverse—or pause,
consolidate,andthenresumethecurrentdirectionalmove.
(cid:2)
Dynamic VAP profiles that are narrower (top to bottom) area relatively
lower-volatilitystatesandproviderelativelylower-riskentryopportunities,
compared to wider Dynamic VAP profiles, which are relatively higher-
volatilitystates.
(cid:2)
When price is trading inside a Dynamic VAP profile, we look to buy the
lows in the range and/or short the highs. To improve trading odds in this
situation,wegivedirectionalpreferencetohigher-timeframetrends.

to assist in market analysis, getting on the right side of the market, and
managingtrades.TASPRONavigatorprovidesseveraltypesofactionablein-
formation about underlying trading conditions and is a composite indicator
that combines classic trend and volatility indicators to highlight trend, non-
trend,momentum,potentialexhaustion,andreversalpoints.(SeeFigures5.21
and5.22.)
FivekeyfeaturesofTASPRONavigatorare:
1. Rich, colorful display of multiple algorithms that is usable on any time-
frame.
2. Indicates which side of the trade to be on, where there is the highest
probability of going in the direction of capital flow, and which side to
avoid,wherethereislessercapitalflow.
3. Measuresmomentumandrelativestrengthorrelativeweaknessofunder-
lyingtrend.
4. Indicatespricedivergenceandpeakconditions.
5. Shows shifts in market conditions from one phase to the next: uptrend,
countertrendshort,downtrend,andcountertrendlong.

The steps to determine your actions are to first identify the phase of market
development (vertical or horizontal) and whether it is early in that phase or
late. Next, identify the Areas of Opportunity within vertical or horizontal
development. Once these are determined, trade locations can be identified
andappropriatetradetacticscanbeappliedtoeachsituation.
The four market development phases to distinguish in higher and then
lowertimeframesare:
1. Maturebalance(maturehorizontaldevelopment)
2. Earlyverticaldevelopment
3. Matureverticaldevelopment
4. Earlystageofbalance(earlyhorizontaldevelopment)
A mature balance area is a range with relatively equal highs and rela-
tively equal lows and many overlapping swings within the horizontal range.
When viewing the volume profile (TAS PRO VAP Map), it will most often

and Point of Control that is approximately centered. It doesn’t have to be
symmetricalbutoftenis.
Note: We make a distinction between a profile map’s Point of Control
versusaHighVolumeArea,asfollows:
(cid:2)
The Point of Control (POC) is the price containing the highest volume
accumulation in a volume-at-price distribution. This also applies to the
highest accumulation of time at price in a time-at-price distribution. The
POCofaVAPMaporTAPMapdistributioniscoloredlightgreen.
(cid:2)
A High Volume Area (HVA) in a profile map is an area of pronounced
high volume-at-price on the vertical scale in comparison with surround-
ing volume above and below. The peak of the bell-shaped curve often
forms in a volume profile during horizontal development but it can also
refer to an area of high volume-at-price in a phase of vertical develop-
ment.Theimportantkeyisthattherehasbeenmuchgreatertradeactivity
and volume compared with surrounding prices. VAP Map clearly identi-
fies the HVAs in any timeframe with a red or magenta color. (For full-
color examples of this color coding in TAS Professional profile maps, visit
http://www.tasprofessional.com/bloomberg/indicators.php.)
Abalanceareacanbeconsideredmaturebytakingonthesecharacteristics
in its volume accumulation at price (volume profile) or in its time accumu-
lation at price—or both. The process of a balance area becoming mature
is a graduated spectrum and is not a suddenly definable event. Discretion is
requiredtodeterminerelativematurityofabalancearea;however,theseguide-
lineswillallowyoutomakeareasonabledetermination.(SeeFigure5.25.)
Early stage vertical development most often follows horizontal develop-
ment,theonlyexceptionbeinginthecaseofaV-pivotreversal.Typicalprice
action in transition to this phase will be a price movement away from the
HVA of a balance area and outside of the extremes of the balance area. The
character of this movement is most often described by terms such as sharp,
forceful,persistent,oraggressive .

Mature vertical development describes the phase of market development
that occurs at or near the end of a vertical, trending move. Indications that
a phase of vertical development is mature can include a slowing of the price
movement(i.e.,aformationofbalanceonasmallertimeframe),adecreased
slope of price movement, greater overlap and retracements of the price bars,
weakinternalstothepricemovement,divergencesinvolume,ordivergences
in indicators such as TAS PRO Navigator. Smaller countertrend moves will
begintobreakinitialsupport/resistanceareasthathavepreviouslyheld.(See
Figure5.27.)
TAS PRO Navigator is one of the tools we use to give an advanced
indication that a stage of vertical development is ending. The appearance of
magenta bars is a high-probability indication of peaking conditions. When
magenta bars appear, you should be on high alert that the market may be
endingitstrendingmoveandtransitioningtoaphaseofbalance(transitioning
fromverticaldevelopmenttohorizontaldevelopment).Thisismostoftenthe

profile or time-at-price profile will look malformed/immature (meaning it

tional price behavior and give an advanced indication that the market may

Dynamic VAP offers a dynamic representation of developing balance versus
existing imbalance using a proprietary three-line display that is a proxy for

Are the Dynamic VAPs acting as reliable support and resistance areas in

VAP Map and Dynamic VAP provide concrete and objective levels that
allow market professionals to know when and at what price levels the phase
of development is confirmed or invalidated. And when invalidated, a new
trade premise and analysis process begins. The great advantage of this type
of analytical approach is that it is based on objective information that helps
marketprofessionalsdeveloptrustandconfidenceintheiranalyses.

Each phase of market development has specific tactics according to the TAS

different types of trades based on market development, let’s first cover two
basictacticsthatwewillreferto:theProbeandPullbackandtheReversaland

These skinny areas are known as holes in the market in the sense that
where price/volume did not accumulate and develop horizontally, it leaves a
hole in the chart. A hole in a chart is an area that expresses an absence of
horizontaldevelopment.

That leaves only two choices: get long or do nothing. You may miss an

to one side, then the other side starts looking pretty good. This is clearly
a mind-set that needs cultivating but that has dramatic results, especially
for newer traders. (More experienced traders are so used to just doing and

From the CBOT to the Charts
I remember the day that I walked onto the floor of the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT) for the first time as an associated member with the privilege
totradeanyfinancialinstrument.Beforethisday,myattitudehadbeenthat
ifotherscoulddosomething,thensocouldI.Ihavealwayslikedachallenge.
But the challenge I was facing at the CBOT was serious, much more
serious than a sporting event or a card game, and it was a competition in

Basically, I had some money, but had never traded a futures contract,
which in hindsight was rather arrogant on my part. Nor did I have any
knowledgeofmarketmaking(thejobofthelocal).Ontopofthis,Ididnot
haveagameplanforhowtospeculate.IthoughtIwouldbeabletofigureit
outasIwent.Yes,IknewIwouldprobablyloseacoupleoftimes,butmost
of my experiences were of things that came easily to me. I felt that I would
prevail.
IwantedtotradeintheBondPit,whichwasadjacenttothemainfloor
in an area called the South Room. The South Room and the Bond Pit were
smallcomparedtothemainfloor,wherethesoybean,corn,andwheatfutures
traded. Nonetheless, traders would flock in, jamming shoulder-to-shoulder,
producingauniquescentoffearandgreedthatfilledtheroom.
Before this day, I had never seen the South Room nor experienced the
excitement of being there. Yes, the CBOE CBOT had mandated that new
members pass a test on exchange rules, required us to understand the me-
chanicsofthehandgesturesessentialtosignal“buy”and“sell,”andprovided
us with a walkthrough of the grain floor. However, the member who pro-
vided our floor tour only pointed to the South Room and never took us
inside. If I remember correctly, his comment was “those wishing to make
theirfortunesinourlatestexperiment,thebonds,gothroughthatopenarea
overthere.”
Sowiththepreviousdayofinstructions,Iheadedstraightforthatopen-
ing. My first order of business was securing a place to stand. Without any
knowledge of how important these spots were, I attempted to stand on the
top step so I could see all the actions. Notice that I use the word attempted.
The top step is reserved for the main brokers and certain big locals. I was
immediately and forcefully ejected by almost everyone within reach. Some

Quickly I formulated a new plan of attack. I decided that in order for
peopletotradewithme,Imustincreasemysize.Soonmyfirstday—without
ever trading a single futures contract in my life—I increased the number of
contractsIwaswillingtotrade.Bigmistake!Then,tocompoundthisblunder,
Icreatedatwo-sidedmarketwhereIwaswillingtobuyorsell.Anevenbigger
mistake! Almost immediately, I was hit by traders on the steps above me.
They swarmed me like locusts demanding that I accept their trade. I was so
confused by the time I had written down all the trades that I did not even
knowmycount(thenumberofcontractsIcurrentlyowned).Andworse,the
markethadmovedawayfrommypositionandIwasstaringatlosses.
IbegantopanicasItriedtounloadmypositions.Again,noonewould
trade with me. The losses were growing by the moment and I was getting
more frantic by the tick. All of a sudden, a trader from the top step decided
to take my offer. After all was said and done, I was down a considerable
percentageofmyaccountsize—allinamannerofseconds.“Welcometothe
Pit,” someone next to me muttered. Throughout the remainder of the first
dayandseveralothersthatfollowed,Ilostmoneyonalmosteverytrade.And
bytheendofthefirstweek,Iwasprettymuchdemoralized.Itwasveryclear
tomeIdidnotknowwhatIwasdoingandthatIdidnothaveaplan.
ThenextMondayarrivedandIfoundmyselfreluctanttoevengotothe

standing outside the pit, questioning my ability to understand when to buy

Afterachievingmoderatesuccessasalocal,Ibeganhavingconversations

brokerwhowantedtostartaFuturesCommissionMerchant(FCM)through
Chase Manhattan. My customers were mostly foreign trading banks operat-
ing out of New York, London, and Tokyo. The change was a challenge, as
theinformationthatcanbefoundonthefloorwasnolongeravailable.The
low cost to trade was gone. And the approach to making money was com-
pletelydifferent.Thankfully, Iwasstillonthequest tolearnmore,and Pete
Steidlmayer—along with the Board of Trade—was introducing the Market
Profile trading concept. Without hesitation I knew he could help me, and I
attended his first class, where to my surprise there were only five attendees.
During the early years with the FCM, I used the Profile to interpret the
market. As it gained popularity, many of my clients wanted to learn how to
incorporate it into their trading process. So I began sending them through
Pete’s classes. I must have sent him 200-plus traders in all. It was during
this time that I met Tim Mather, owner of CQG, as this company was the
firstvendortoprogramtheMarketProfileandsuppliedPete’sclasseswithits

effort,othershadtofollow.Withinafewyears,becauseofSteve’seffortsand
CQG, Candlestick Charting was on the menu of every quote vendor who
publishedcharts.
In 1994, Tom DeMark contacted me. Tom had made a decision to
introduce his indicators to the world and was seeking a vendor. His first
choice was CQG. Only a few days before Tom contacted me, Tim Mather
hadcalledandaskedifIhadreadthearticleinFutures magazineaboutTom
DeMarkandhisindicators.Iansweredyesandwebothagreedthatthiswas

and we agreed to meet in Chicago where he could present his work. Before
the meeting even began, I knew I was going to work out a deal with Tom,
andwithindaysofthatmeeting,CQGbeganprogramminghisindicators.
While other indicators and charting methods have been introduced
over the years, only a handful have changed the way people look at mar-
kets. These three—Market Profile, Candlestick Charting, and the DeMark

Trading by Gut Feeling
When it came to the successful traders whom I sought out, some wereopen
to talking, as most of them used CQG. They were interested in what we
were building and I was fascinated with how they made money. When I

enteredandexitedthemarket.Iactuallythoughtthateachwouldseethesame
opportunityandallwouldactatthesametime.Whatbecameapparentwas
that they each had their own unique way of entering the market (which did
not necessarily coincide with other traders). And interestingly, many times
their exits involved a gut feel for when the trade was over for them: most
would say something like, “Time is running out on this trade.” Hardly a
trader could explain the how or the why of this exit due to time, but the
ability to use the concept certainly separated them from traders who were
solelyfocusedontheentries.Ontopofthisquality,theyeachhadenormous
control over their emotions during the trade. They could sit through some

Traders needed additional assistance with their interpretation, methods to
measuretimeatrisk,andtoolstohandlethetradethroughoutitslife.From
alltheseexperiences,meetings,andcircumstances,Ihavebeenabletoeither
develop, partner, or purchase the needed assets that could help answer these
issues. I call these tools ATMs. Currently there are 14 such studies. They
work in conjunction with one another, each with their own strengths. But
usedcollectivelyandproperly,theyareapowerfulcombination.
What I learned from my experiences and how ATM deals with my
observationsisillustratedandexplainedinthesectionsfollowing.
Understanding the Background of an Opportunity
Understanding is a key to success, and that knowledge refers to what is
happeningatthatmomentandprovidesyoutheabilitytomaneuver,adjust,
andremaincalm.Yousolveyourproblemsoradjusttocurrentcircumstances
with an understanding of the background or the overall condition of each
timeframe,projectingforward,andrealizingitscontrasttothepresent.
Traditional bar or line charts provide a good deal of information about
price but nothing about the conditions that surround it. Most charts are
simplyproducedaslightbarsonadarkbackgroundordarkbarsonalighter
background. Consequently, the question becomes how you interpret the
action.
The ATM studies tell a story of the backdrop of the market by drawing
a picture. The studies change the dark or light chart into a roadmap that
helps you monitor the market’s transition from bullish to bearish and back
so you can easily integrate the studies, charts, and interpretation into your
workflow.Thepicturebeginswiththreestudiesusedtodeterminetheoverall
marketconditionsandtrendidentification.TheyareATMTrendBars,ATM
Trend Lines, and ATM Trigger TSB (Trend Strength Bar) Line, the last
of which is the most important. All three of these math models are used
to define the condition of the current trend. With them, you can determine
whetherthecurrentpriceactivityisbullishorbearishandwhetherthecurrent
trend is about to start or end. With ATM, and its use of color, markets can
be described objectively by their behavior instead of subjectively based on
one’s interpretation. And during volatile markets, the studies will help you
instill rational behavior when fear can overtake you. Let’s take a look at
eachone.

ATMTrendBars
ATM Trend Bars are used to help define market conditions. Most chart-
ing programs use green bars to show a bullish condition, red bars for a
bearish condition, and a default color (usually black) for a neutral—or
undefined—condition. In Figure 6.1, you can see that trend bars were
bullish from the start of the chart through the beginning of September and
mostlybullishfrommid-Septembertomid-November.Frommid-November
through to the end of the chart, trend bars showed bearish conditions with
threeshortneutralperiods.Figures6.2–6.8usethissamedataset.
ATMTrendLines
ATM Trend Lines together with ATM Trend Bars further define a market’s
condition.BlueATMTrendLinesrepresentabullishmarketcondition.Red

ATMTrigger
The ATM Trigger is an oscillator comprised of three models represented by
threelines.TheyaretheATMTSBLine(TrendStrengthBar),theATMFT
(FastTrigger),andtheATMST(SlowTrigger).Let’sbeginwiththeTSB.

The ATM TSB line can have up to three different colors on either the
bullish or bearish TSB line (represented in shades of gray in the figures in
this chapter). The bullish TSB can have a light blue line, which indicates a
rapid rise in the market price, a dark green line representing mildly bullish
trend strength, or a bright green line that represents a strongly bullish trend
condition. The bearish TSB line can have a magenta line, which indicates a

The ATM X Alert is designed to pick up the earliest possible condition that

indicator as it has little to no new trend confirmation. Represented by an
X above or below the bar, this alert requires the previous ATM TSB line to
end and the ATM FT line to move to an overbought or oversold condition
shortly after the end of the ATM TSB line. During the ensuing eight bars,
anticipate quick price movement and the overall condition of the market
to begin changing into the new potential trend. Should these changes not
occur over the specified time period, the new trend may not be developing
as expected and you should consider exiting the position before any initial
stopishit.

locate an ATM Fast Trigger to Price divergence at significant highs/lows of
the market. Typical divergences occur throughout a trend. However, only a
particularly defined divergence that occurs at potential market extremes is
picked up by ATM. Specifically, in the case of the ATM Divergence Alert,
it requires the surrounding low/high of the previous ATM FT Cycle to be a
significant low/high as defined by ATM (see Figure 6.11). This is followed
by a premature turn up/down of the current ATM FT cycle coupled with a
higher high/lower low than the last significant high/low. In other words, a
new significant high/low is being made while the ATM FT is prematurely
failingtocycletoanextremeoverbought/oversoldcondition.

When you have an edge such as FT, you can give up the bid or offer to

understandthebackdropofthemarket.UsingATMontwotimeframeswill
allowyouanunderstandingofthisbackdrop.ThisisaccomplishedwithATM
Trend Line, ATM Trend Bars, and the ATM Trigger Line–TSB. In the next
sectionwetakealookatsomeexamples.
Don’t Fight the Trend
A few of the traders would say “the market will punish those who try and
fight it.” I had a hard time with this one as I first thought it meant you had

(cid:2)
After the extreme, a change in the market condition occurs after a period
oftime.
Regardless of how you choose to participate at the extremes of a move,
use the ATM Trigger–FT line to help you determine if the market is in an
oversold or overbought condition. And following your entry, monitor the
overallconditionofthemarketduringtheprecedingeightbarsforachange
of condition. For example, when you buy a market extreme, ATM would
specify the overall market condition as bearish and would color the ATM
Trend Bars red (indicating a bearish market). And of course, you would be
expecting the market to respond to your purchase. But if the market does

sure the ATM Trigger FT line is also oversold and turning up; and (c) the
market must change its overall condition from bearish to bullish, preferably
before the ATM Trigger FT reaches overbought and turns down. See the
exampleinFigure6.12.
Anothermethodtotradeendingtrendactioniswaitingforaquickvertical
move in the direction you wish to trade. Then, wait for a price retracement
that fails to take out the previous low/high created by the quick vertical
movement, and then enter the market. ATM calls this pattern a “failure to
continue” and this action is picked up within the ATM X signals and or
ATM First Alert. The process is as follows: on the retracement, monitor the
condition of the ATM FT line. Look for the FT to reach an overbought or
oversoldconditionwhilemonitoringprice.Priceshouldnotgolower/higher

Trade Location Is Key to Long-term Success
Obviously, if you are a buyer/seller of extremes, you will have a great trade
location, should the current down/uptrend end. But if your trade develops
into a trend, you will be presented with additional opportunities to entry
using ATM Add On Alerts and ATM Pullback Alerts. The key to successful

Learning to Control Your Emotions
OneofthemostinterestingtradersImetwasEdSakota.Hisentirefocuswas

thissubjectwas,especiallywhenitrelatedtotradingmoney.Thereisnoway
I can do this subject justice in a few sentences; however, I can tell you that
without this skill, you will not necessarily fail at trading, but you will never
beassuccessfulasyoucouldbe.
The Hardest Part of Any Strategy Is the Exit
By far the most difficult decisions you will make will involve when to exit
your trade. As I mentioned earlier, the traders I observed had an ability to
understandwhentimewasrunningoutontheposition.ATMbelievesyour
positionsshouldbemonitoredatalltimesforthefollowingattributes.
New positions must make some price movement in your favor within a
preset amount of time. Should you not get any significant price movement
withinthattimelimit,exit.Youcanalwaysreestablishthepositionlater.Ifyou
arebuying/sellingexhaustion,theconditionofthemarketmustchangetothe
directionofyourpositionwithinapresetamountoftime.Shouldnochange
inconditionoccurwithinthattimelimit,exit.Ifyouarebuying/sellingwith
the trend, your trade location may not be ideal, so you must have quick
accelerationofpriceandmaintainthecurrentconditionofthemarketwithin
a smaller preset amount of time. Should no quick movement in price occur
orshouldyouobserveachangeintheoverallmarketcondition,exit.
As the trend ages, the price movement has two effects. Higher trending
price, particularly in equities, brings in additional buyers. Monitor for the
conditions of your security on longer timeframes. Make sure the longer-
timeframe condition concurs with the shorter. Plus, be aware of the longer
timeframe getting oversold/overbought as it relates to the ATM Trigger FT
line, as a change in direction of the FT in the longer timeframe will put
pressureonprice.
Lower trending price of a fundamentally sound company encourages
buying (dollar cost averaging) all the way down. So be careful as you reach
downsideATMTargetsorcertaintrendexhaustionindicators.Expectagood
company to return to an uptrend. And the lower you go, expect the lower
prices to attract investors. Lower trending price of a fundamentally flawed
companydoesnotusuallyhavethecatalystofdollarcostaveraging.Therefore,
it must have a positive fundamental change to bring about a fresh new set

of buyers. If you are short this type of company, monitor for changes in the
ATMTrendBars,ATMTrendLines,andATMTrigger–TSBline.Whenyou
begin to see the end of the TSB line, begin to consider exiting. Definitely
exit once you see the TSB line in green condition and new buy signals
emerging.
Some ATM customers use the ATM Exhaustion Alerts to exit or trade
aroundpositions,butnottoreverse.ExhaustionAlertsshouldbeusedmostly
to exit from existing positions and not necessarily to establish new positions
fromasingletimeframe.IfyoudoreverseutilizinganATMExhaustionAlert,
the market must move very rapidly for you and the condition of the market

Otherwise,themarketwillresumeitstrend.Inaddition,theissuewithtrading

our research, this will move price sideways to down for approximately eight

As price is moving closer to the monthly ATM FT turning point, we

this case, wechose the weekly. The weekly began aligning withthe monthly

As each of the longer timeframes aligns, we await the next daily ATM
FT turning point to act (see Figure 6.19). With the monthly close to turn-
ing in October 2009, the weekly moved to its position during November
5 to November 12, and the daily ATM FT turned down on November 9,
2010, within the week of November 12. Once the trade is made utilizing
the daily turn in the ATM FT, we begin trading the weekly ATM FT over-
bought/oversold conditions in the direction of the monthly background for
