Foreword
Top traders rarely call attention to their many accomplishments, content to execute
and perfect their own market views, free from self-promotion and outside noise.
Deron Wagner is that type of rare individual, a two-decade trader and long-time fund
manager, with unique market insights that are simple, profound, and highly action-
able. For that reason, I’m pleased to introduce readers to the second edition of his
book Trading ETFs: Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis.
I fi rst met Deron just outside a lecture hall in Dallas, TX back in the year 2000,
right after the Internet bubble burst. He had just released his fi rst book, at the same
time that my fi rst book, The Master Swing Trader, was set to hit the fi nancial book-
shelves. That brief meeting and industry chit chat fostered a mutual respect and part-
nership that has endured for the last twelve years.
For a good part of the last decade, I’ve been fortunate enough to publish Deron’s
daily market insights at my web site, “Hard Right Edge.” It’s been the site’s most
popular column throughout its tenure, hands down, but I’m not surprised because his
technical profi ciency refl ects a depth of knowledge and confi dence that inspires trad-
ers at all experience levels to return on a daily basis. Clearly it’s become an invaluable
tool in their trading methodologies.
In addition, Deron’s long-time focus on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has honed
a market strategy perfectly in tune with today’s fast paced derivative-driven electronic
market environment. For that reason alone, I expect that readers of Trading ETFs:
Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis will gain valuable insights that are unavailable
through any other market source, online or in print.
Don’t be fooled by the apparent simplicity of Deron’s systematic approach. Under
the hood, he presents a powerful trading system based on classic market principles
that work in euphoric bull markets as well as gut-wrenching bear markets. More
importantly, these reliable strategies are unaffected by the computer-driven program
algorithms we’ve come to know as high-frequency trading (HFT).
This is an amazing accomplishment in a challenging environment that’s forced all
types of market players to reassess the positive expectancy of their trading edges. This
resilience offers another advantage in reading this excellent book. Simply stated, it will
help your own strategies to overcome the dominance of lighting fast computer trading
in the day to day price action.

Trading ETFs: Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis, Second Edition
by Deron Wagner
Copyright © 2012 Deron Wagner
CHAPTER 1
Why Use Technical Analysis
with ETFs?
Unlike most books on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), this one offers you strategies
based on technical analysis, not fundamental analysis. When I began trading profes-
sionally in 1999, before ETFs took the market by storm, people tried to convince me
of the merits of studying fundamental factors, such as price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios,
balance sheets, earnings growth, and news events. I’ve always believed that a deep
knowledge of these items is theoretically important, but fundamentals seem to have a
direct impact only on the long-term direction of a stock. In the short to intermediate
term, the correlation between the actual price action of an ETF and its fundamentals
is rarely signifi cant. Technical analysis, however, tells me everything I need to know
about the odds of a trade continuing in the current direction or reversing.
Because an ETF consists of a diverse plethora of individual stocks, using funda-
mental analysis of the underlying stocks to predict the price movement of the actual
ETF brings less than satisfactory results. The only way to have a greater than 50–50
chance of predicting the short- and intermediate-term trends of ETFs is through
sound technical analysis. This is why my hedge fund, Morpheus Capital LP, is one
of the few professional hedge funds that primarily bases its investment and trading
decisions on the technical analysis strategies I share with you in this book, rather than
more traditional fundamental analysis and “long-term” investing. Although the tech-
niques presented here are designed to work ideally with ETFs, individual stock traders
can successfully apply the same techniques.
To understand the problems with a fundamentals-based system of analysis,
c onsider the effect news events such as earnings reports often have on stocks and
ETFs. How many times has a company reported what is perceived as a strong earn-
ings report, only to see the stock price go down several points the next day? A positive
price reaction to a poor earnings report is equally common. The increase or decrease
in the price of the stock that can occur in anticipation of a positive or negative earn-
ings report is one of the reasons these inverse price reactions occur. With technical
analysis, however, news events are irrelevant to your analysis. The price and volume of
the stock or ETF already tells you everything you need to know. If the equity has been
trending higher for quite some time, odds are favorable that it will continue to do so.

4 ETF Overview and Selection
Likewise, a stock or ETF stuck in a protracted downtrend will remain that way until
the chart pattern proves otherwise.
I have designed this book to provide a logical, step-by-step process that enables
you to easily master ETF trading using technical analysis. Whether you’re a profes-
sional, full-time investor or someone who wishes to learn new techniques for actively
managing his personal portfolio, you will benefi t from the strategies.
In Part I, the fi rst chapter provides you with a brief history of the growth of
ETFs, which has made my strategies possible, as well as my thoughts on some of the
advantages of investing and trading in ETFs instead of individual stocks. Chapter 2
describes the numerous fund families from which you can choose ETF products, as
well as the unique types of ETFs that began coming to market around 2005. In addi-
tion to the popular ETFs composed simply of individual stocks, ETF offerings on the
market now include currency, commodity, fi xed-income, inversely correlated “short
ETFs,” leveraged ETFs, and even ETFs that are both inversely correlated and lever-
aged. There are also ETNs (exchange-traded notes), which are structured as fi nancial
instruments, similar to bonds but possessing credit risk.
In Part II, I dive into the “meat and potatoes of the strategy by showing you
specifi cally how technical analysis is used to trade ETFs. Chapter 3 details my top-
down strategy of ETF trading, which always improves your odds of success by iden-
tifying the overall trend of the broad market, determining which sector indexes
are showing the most relative strength compared to the overall stock market, and
then selecting the specifi c ETF family with the most relative strength compared to
the corresponding sector index. Chapter 4 details the method of fi nding the sector
indexes with the most relative strength. Chapter 5 drills down to the specifi c ETF
families with the most relative strength, and Chapter 6 provides supplemental tech-
nical indicators and chart patterns.
After learning how to select the best ETFs for trading and investing, the next
step is fi guring out the proper timing for entries and exits into those positions. This
is covered extensively in Part III. Chapter 7 provides strategies for determining ideal
entry points, and Chapter 8 shows you when to exit your positions. Chapters 9 and 10
put it all together by graphically walking you through actual trades I have made using
the strategies offered in the fi rst eight chapters. The actual outcome of the trades,
using real capital, is also presented. Chapter 9 discusses 10 actual ETFs I bought long.
Chapter 10 discusses 10 ETFs I sold short. Many nuances of the entire technical
analysis strategy can be gleaned from these two chapters, as they are real-life situations,
not merely the theory behind the strategy.
In Part IV, I provide you with a host of pointers to help fi ne-tune your strategy after
you put it into action. Topics such as position sizing, getting effi cient ETF executions,
and identifying relative strength intraday are all covered in Chapter 11. Chapter 12 pro-
vides some fi nal thoughts and pointers to “take along with you.” I encourage you to take
your time reading the material, unlike a novel you might breeze through, so that you
can fully digest the concepts presented. You may realize the greatest benefi t through fi rst
reading the book cover to cover, and then going back and reviewing the more detailed
sections to ensure you have a thorough understanding of the key points.

Why Use Technical Analysis with ETFs? 5
History and Growth of ETFs
Although you probably already have a basic understanding of ETFs, it’s important to
understand just how many options you have when selecting potential ETF trades. The
astonishing growth both in the quantity and types of ETFs may surprise you.
An exchange-traded fund is a basket of stocks that trades on an exchange with the
same simplicity and liquidity of an individual stock. Traders and investors can buy
or sell shares in the collective performance of an entire stock, bond, commodity, or
even currency portfolio by buying or selling a single security. ETFs add the fl exibil-
ity, ease, volatility, and liquidity of stock trading to the benefi ts of traditional index-
fund investing. The American Stock Exchange (Amex) launched the fi rst U.S.-based
ETF in 1993 as a simple way for more aggressive retail investors to buy the entire
realm of stocks that made up the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Trading under the
ticker symbol SPY, the Standard and Poor’s Depositary Receipt (SPDR) was born.
The Amex devised the ETF because it wanted to attract stock market investors who
had become more interested in trading and investing in individual stocks than mutual
funds. Although many investors enjoyed the high rates of return that individual stocks
provided throughout the 1990s, many people still preferred the perceived “safety”
that traditional mutual funds offered. Hence, the ETF was introduced as a way for
investors to combine the potentially high returns of individual stock trading with the
benefi ts of diversifi cation that mutual funds provided.
In February 1994, one year after its offi cial launch, SPY was trading an average
daily volume of only 250,000 shares. Its popularity quickly spread, and the average daily
volume of SPY increased more than 12 times to over 3 million shares per day by the
beginning of 1998, fi ve years after its launch. Although such a large initial increase in
volume may seem impressive, it was only the beginning for the popularity of SPY. The
absolute lows of last decade’s equity bear market, which were set in October 2002,
marked the largest percentage increase in the average daily volume of SPY. In October
2002, the 50-day average daily volume of SPY was 48 million shares per day. By mid-
2007, SPY was already clocking in at more than 200 million shares trading hands on
an average day. That represented an astronomical increase in daily trading activity of
approximately 80,000 percent in 13 years.
The bear market of 2000 to 2002 was partially responsible for generating inter-
est in SPY and other ETFs as investors grew tired of attempting to pick individual
winning stocks during such adverse conditions and found it easier to simply choose
an ETF that suited their goals. SPY and other major ETFs have seen a remarkable
increase in turnover, which began accelerating parabolically in the years 2000 through
2006. To grasp the astonishing growth of the fi rst domestic ETF, look at the volume
bars on the monthly chart of SPY in Figure 1.1.
Thanks to SPY, the concept of having transparent exposure to an entire broad-based
index through the simplicity of buying an individual stock caught on quickly. This
popularity rapidly spurred demand for the launch of more diverse ETF offerings. A
second domestic ETF was launched in 1995, and the rest is history. By 2003, just
10 years after the introduction of SPY, the number of domestic ETF offerings had

grown to 119. Four short years later, by 2007, the number of ETFs traded on the U.S.
exchanges had increased fi vefold to more than 600. As of the end of 2010, the number
of ETFs had swollen to nearly 1,000. Now, as of July 2011, there are more than 1,000
ETFs. Figure 1.2 shows how rapidly the total number of ETFs has multiplied since

But it’s not only the number of ETFs that has increased dramatically: The total
asset growth of ETFs has been equally impressive. Figure 1.3 illustrates the total com-
bined asset growth of ETFs since 1993.
From 1994 to 2000, total assets in ETFs doubled every year. Since 2000, the
growth has obviously slowed a bit, but combined assets are still increasing at nearly 50
percent per year. The only year with declining asset growth was in 2008, which was
probably attributed to a sharp decline in global equity markets that year.
Considering that the birth of these innovative instruments began with a single ETF
just 18 years ago, the growth is astounding. With no signs of waning interest, the asset
growth shown in the preceding fi gure indicates that there is enough sustainable demand
to continue meeting the constantly expanding number of ETF offerings.
The diverse mix of ETFs provides technical traders with more opportunities than ever.
While you are probably familiar with the commonplace ETFs that track major indexes
such as the S&P 500, the Dow, or the Nasdaq, it’s important to understand the full range
of instruments in your ETF trading arsenal. The next chapter looks at each of the major
types of ETFs, as well as at the popular ETF families that constitute each type.
Trading ETFs versus Individual Stocks
Although I invest in and trade both individual stocks and exchange-traded funds,
ETFs have some unique benefi ts over stocks. The following are the reasons I initially
became attracted to trading ETFs as a great alternative to trading individual stocks:
Safety through diversifi cation. Do you ever wonder if you are going to wake up in
the morning and fi nd out your stock dropped 50 percent because the CEO was

caught with his hands in the cookie jar? This is never an issue with ETFs because
they automatically diversify equities and usually have minimal exposure to any
one individual stock.
Consider, for example, the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund
(PSI), the composition of which is shown in Table 1.1. As of July 2011, a total
of 30 stocks represented the underlying portfolio of PSI. Of those, the largest
percentage weighting of any individual stock was only 5.19 percent. Even if that
company (QUALCOMM Inc.) had bad news that caused its stock to plummet
overnight, the net effect on the price of the ETF would be minimal. By trading
ETFs, you are automatically reducing your risk of damaging losses from overnight
gaps (sessions in which the opening price of an ETF signifi cantly varies from the
previous day’s closing price). (See Chapter 7 for a full discussion of overnight gaps.)

Access to more markets. Through exchange-traded funds, retail investors and traders
now have access to markets that were previously diffi cult and expensive to partici-
pate in. Treasury bonds, international markets, commodities, and even currency
ETFs can all be traded with the same ease and low commission of an individual
stock. With new ETFs constantly being created, the realm of trading opportuni-
ties is boundless.
Liquidity is never an issue. Unlike individual stocks, in which liquidity can greatly
affect how a stock trades, all ETFs are synthetic instruments. As such, the average
daily volume that an ETF trades is largely irrelevant. Even if a low-volume ETF
had no buyers or sellers for several hours, the bid and ask prices would continue to
move in correlation with the fair market value that is derived from the prices of the
underlying stocks. Because all ETFs are linked to an index, and the intraday fair
market value moves in line with the underlying index, specialists can easily provide
continuous pricing. If a large institutional buy or sell order suddenly arrived on an
ETF with low average daily volume, the price would not jump, as it would with
an illiquid stock.
Unlike stocks, ETFs are not traded on an auction system. Instead, demand
is automatically met through computerized algorithms that allow specialists to
create and redeem shares in an ETF at its net asset value (NAV). This is done in
large blocks of shares that represent creation or redemption baskets. Once cre-
ated, these new shares can then be traded in the secondary market.
An ETF with a low average daily volume may sometimes have slightly wider
spreads between the bid and ask prices than an ETF with a high average daily
volume, but you can simply use limit orders (a specifi ed maximum price you
are willing to pay for the position) instead of market orders if this is the case.
Moreover, if you’re trading for multiple points, paying a few cents more on occa-
sion should not be a big deal.
Lower trading commissions. Prior to the inception of ETFs, traders were
forced to pay a separate commission for each individual stock if they wanted
to buy a basket of stocks within a particular industry sector. However, through
trading in sector-specifi c ETFs, traders pay only one commission to buy or sell
short an entire group of stocks within an industry.
Better odds of follow-through. Has this ever happened to you? You have
identifi ed a particular sector you would like to be in, you place the trade to buy a
stock, and then you watch every single stock in that industry move higher except
the one you are in. With ETFs, you are at less risk of buying or selling short the
wrong stock because you are participating in an entire group of stocks within a
sector. If you buy the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (IBB), it does
not matter much if Morgan Stanley has a big sell order on Amgen stock, because
you also have exposure to many other stocks within the Biotechnology Index.
Chances are you’re already familiar with ETFs and perhaps already invest in them.
Nevertheless, I am confi dent you will appreciate and profi t from the concise and

CHAPTER 2
Major Types and
Families of ETFs
The most popular and well-known exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are those that track
the major stock market indexes such as the S&P 500, the Dow, and the Nasdaq 100
Index. Other broad-based ETFs mirror more specifi c indexes such as the small-cap
Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400.
Within the arena of broad-based ETFs, there are also more specialized “mar-
ket segment” ETFs that break down the main stock market indexes according to
focus: growth, value, or dividend. When the entire stock market is overly bull-
ish, there may not be much of an advantage to trading in the market segment
ETFs. Nevertheless, during periods of range-bound trading, when most of the main
indexes are stagnant, you will often fi nd that certain segments, such as value-focused
or dividend-focused, outperform signifi cantly. This is because mutual funds, hedge
funds, and other institutions continually rotate their massive buying power into
specifi c industry sectors that have a greater chance of returning a profi t than the
main stock market indexes, especially in range-bound periods.
Because they are tied to well-known indexes and their composition is easy to
understand, broad-based ETFs, such as the Dow Diamonds (DIA) or the Standard
and Poor’s Depositary Receipt (SPDR), which trades under SPY, are understandably
popular with the masses. But the growing popularity of ETFs in general has spawned
many interesting and unique types of such funds. The following is an overview of each
major type of ETF on the market in mid-2011.
Industry Sector ETFs
I most frequently trade ETFs that are correlated to specifi c industry sectors such as
semiconductor, biotechnology, or utilities. This is because, no matter what the overall
market is doing at any given moment, I can always fi nd an industry that is seeing posi-
tive money fl ow and showing strength relative to the main indexes.
In the late 1990s, the selection of sector-specifi c ETFs was rather limited. Because
of this, the only way to gain exposure to a particular market sector was through trading

12 ETF Overview and Selection
a basket of individual stocks. Although this was a profi table strategy, it was often chal-
lenging to manage a vast array of open positions. Because of excessive brokerage com-
missions, it also became expensive. Fortunately, the advent of sector ETFs simplifi ed
business and also increased profi tability. With ETFs that track specifi c sectors, traders
can speculate on the direction of any number of industries with the same ease and
cost-effectiveness of buying or selling only a single position.
The fi rst, once the most popular family of sector ETFs, is the holding company
depositary receipts (HOLDRs; pronounced holders), which was brought to market by
Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. in 2000. There are 17 HOLDRs, each of which represents
ownership in the common stock or American depositary receipts (ADRs) of specifi ed
companies in a particular industry or sector. Each HOLDR was created to have exactly
20 underlying stocks that are never rotated or changed, except through acquisitions.
The most popular HOLDRs are as follows: the Semiconductor HOLDR (SMH),
the Oil Services HOLDR (OIH), and the Biotechnology HOLDR (BBH). Like the
broad-based ETFs, the average daily volume of most HOLDRs has grown steadily
since their launch in 2000.
When traders and investors caught on to the benefi ts of trading a basket of stocks
with the simplicity of trading an individual stock, trading activity in the HOLDRs
shot through the roof. However, competing fund families hit the markets about fi ve
years later, causing the popularity of the HOLDRs to generally peak around 2007
(based on the trend of the average daily trading volume).
Though they may have been fi rst to market, the HOLDRs are defi nitely no longer
the only game in town. The iShares family of ETFs, from Barclays Global Investors,
NA, also offers a diverse group of sector-specifi c ETFs, including many sectors not
covered by the HOLDR. Basic materials (IYM), consumer cyclical (IYC), and trans-
portation (IYT) are just three of the newer sector ETFs. Within the iShares family are
more than 200 ETFs, but not all of them are sector specifi c. The iShares funds also
consist of many other types of ETFs, and they will be covered later in this chapter.
In 2002, Barclays’ iShares, Select Sector’s SPDRs, and Merrill Lynch’s HOLDR
were the only major families of ETFs that covered a wide array of industry sectors.
Since then, the amazing popularity of ETFs has prompted numerous fi rms to bring
new families of ETFs to the marketplace. Many of these new fund families are still
fl ying under the radar, but one group that attracted much attention in 2006–2007 is
the PowerShares Capital Management LLC family of ETFs.
If you visit the PowerShares web site and browse its investment products, you will
see that the offerings are unique in several ways. First, the site has a handful of sector
ETFs that are not represented by any of the other families. Cleantech (PZD), Water
Resources (PHO), Aerospace & Defense (PPA), and Dynamic Food & Beverage (PBJ)
are just a few of the interesting sector ETFs not yet found anywhere else. Although the
iShares family of funds offers an international ETF that tracks the Chinese Xinhua
25 market (FXI), the PowerShares China ETF (PGJ) tracks a diverse mix of sectors
within mainland China, rather than just one index. In addition to more unusual sec-
tors, the PowerShares family of ETFs also covers mainstream sectors such as semicon-
ductors (PSI), oil and gas (PXJ), and biotechnology (PBE).

==================================================

Major Types and Families of ETFs 13
Along with covering sectors that are overlooked by other ETF families, another
advantage of the PowerShares ETFs is the diversity of the underlying stocks within each
sector. Unlike the HOLDR, in which two or three stocks often represent 30 to 50
percent of the ETF’s value and only 20 stocks make up the entire value of the ETF,
the PowerShares ETFs are represented by a large number of stocks. Further, because
PowerShares is able to change the selection of stocks within each sector ETF, these ETFs
are diversifi ed, unlike the HOLDR in which the same companies have been represented
since they were launched.
The average daily volume of many PowerShares ETFs may be lower than the
equivalent sector ETFs in the iShares or HOLDR families. However, it is important
to remember that the average daily volume level in an ETF is much less signifi cant
than the average volume of an individual stock.
Most large investment fi rms would never consider trading a stock with an aver-
age daily volume of fewer than 100,000 shares because the demand may not be pres-
ent when it comes time to sell the shares. But with an ETF, that is never a problem.
Remember that the bid/ask prices of an ETF will change throughout the day, mirroring
the formulated prices of the underlying stocks, regardless of whether any buyers or sell-
ers are present. As such, there will always be a market when you want to trade in an
ETF. Actual liquidity is not a factor with ETFs, even if they trade fewer than 100,000
shares per day, but the spreads may sometimes be more than a few pennies wide. If this
occurs, using a limit order instead of a market order will easily solve the problem.
Fixed-Income ETFs
A fi xed-income ETF consists of various fi xed-income instruments, most commonly
bonds, rather than a group of underlying individual stocks. It enables investors to
participate in various bond markets with the same ease and simplicity of investing in
the stock market. Although initially designed for investors looking for easy access to
long-term investing in bonds, the fi xed-income ETFs are excellent vehicles for short-
term traders as well.
Launched in July 2002, the iShares family of fi xed-income ETFs was brought to
market by Barclays Global Investors. Prior to the creation of these ETFs, it was diffi cult
for individual investors and traders to have transparency with regard to individual bond
prices, making it challenging to verify prices paid to brokerage fi rms for bond transac-
tions. Liquidity was also a concern at times. Fixed-income mutual funds were a viable
alternative to individual bonds, but they are priced only once per day, at the close of
trading. Capitalizing on intraday movements in bond prices was not possible with bond
mutual funds.
Thanks to the introduction of the iShares fi xed-income ETFs, investors and traders
now have easy access to real-time intraday pricing of various bond indexes and have the
ability to easily buy or sell the ETFs intraday. Like bond mutual funds, fi xed-income
ETFs don’t mature but instead consist of a portfolio that refl ects the underlying bond
index’s target maturity date. As with individual stocks, fi xed-income ETFs can also be

sold short and traded on margin, allowing for interesting possibilities. Fixed-income
ETFs also provide monthly dividend distributions, as do individual bonds.
Participating in the Treasury, corporate bond, and other fi xed-income markets is
now as simple as placing an order to buy or sell a common ETF or individual stock.
Investors also save a lot of money they would spend on transaction costs in actual bonds
because commission fees for fi xed-income ETFs are the same as those of any other indi-
vidual stock trade. This pioneering effort by iShares to launch the fi rst group of fi xed-
income ETFs in 2002 initially consisted of the six fi xed-income funds listed in Table 2.1.
Because total asset growth in fi xed-income ETFs swelled from $3.9 billion in
2002 to more than $20 billion by the end of 2006, iShares decided to expand its
range of fi xed-income ETFs. By 2007, 17 fi xed-income products were available. ETFs
correlated to government credit, corporate bonds, mortgage bonds, and municipal
bonds round out the latest offerings. In mid-2007, both Vanguard Group and State
Street Global Advisors (SSGA) launched small families of fi xed-income ETFs, but the
iShares group remains the most popular.
International ETFs
Because the international markets have followed suit with the bullishness in the U.S.
markets in recent years, ETFs composed of country- or region-specifi c stocks and
ADRs have gained in popularity.
The fi rst international ETFs to be traded on the domestic markets were launched
in 1996. Assets of those fi rst 17 international ETFs totaled just $266 million at the
end of the fi rst year. Fifteen years later, the number of international ETFs has surged
to 298. Combined asset growth in these 298 ETFs was more than $276 billion as of
the end of 2010. Clearly, an increasing percentage of American investors and traders
appreciate the ability to speculate in foreign countries. International ETFs make that
possible, without the need to invest directly in foreign markets.
The market offers a diverse mix of international ETFs, covering both individ-
ual countries and general regions. The astounding growth of several Asian markets,
for example, led to massive asset growth in ETFs such as the iShares FTSE/Xinhua
China 25 Index (FXI), the iShares MSCI Hong Kong Index Fund (EWH), and iShares

Singapore (EWS). International ETFs are available from several ETF families, but the
most diverse offering comes from iShares.
The iShares family includes more than 100 country- and region-specifi c ETFs.
The impressive growth of the iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund (EWJ) illustrates just
how popular international ETFs have become. Between the end of 2000 and mid-
2011, the average daily volume in EWJ increased by nearly 6,000 percent, from a half
million shares traded per day to 29 million shares per day. The average daily volume
of the Hong Kong and China ETFs similarly grew at an amazing speed.
Though a newer player than iShares, the PowerShares family of more than 20
international ETFs has also developed a loyal following. This is partially because it
fi lls the niche of regions not covered by the iShares funds. There are also 14 popular
international ETFs in the Van Eck Market Vectors family of ETFs.
Commodity ETFs
Although commodity trading once required a specialized knowledge of the futures
markets, it can now be done as simply as investing in stocks. Rather than messing with
the leverage and detailed execution details required for futures trading, investors can
now profi t from movements in a variety of commodities by buying the corresponding
commodity ETFs.
The fi rst commodity-based ETF to hit the U.S. markets was the StreetTRACKS
Gold Trust (GLD). Launched in November 2004, GLD was designed as a way for inves-
tors to gain exposure to the price of the spot gold commodity, but without the incon-
venience of storing physical bars. Though the Australian Stock Exchange was the fi rst
market to launch a gold commodity ETF, legal questions over taxation delayed a similar
U.S. product from coming to market. Because futures commodities are taxed differently
from stocks and ETFs, the question was which asset class GLD belonged to. Although a
few subtle nuances are involved, GLD is basically taxed as a stock.
Some commodity ETFs are composed of a basket of underlying commodities
futures contracts, while others actually hold the physical commodity. In the case of
GLD, each share is backed by actual gold reserves.
The transparency of commodity ETFs varies, depending on the actual commod-
ity being tracked. The share prices of some ETFs can be easily derived because they
mirror the actual price of a commodity. Such is the case with GLD, whose share price
is equal to one-tenth the price of one ounce of spot gold, less small expenses for the
trust. The PowerShares DB Agricultural Fund (DBA), on the other hand, is com-
posed of futures contracts that include corn, wheat, soybeans, and sugar. Each con-
tract expires in a specifi c month and on a specifi c exchange. As such, trading DBA is
not as cut-and-dried as knowing that the price of GLD, for example, will always trade
at roughly one-tenth the price of spot gold.
The U.S. Oil Fund (USO) is supposedly designed to mirror the price of one bar-
rel of crude oil; however, the mix of expirations on the individual underlying futures
contracts, designed to “hedge” the risk, often causes USO to lag behind the actual

price of crude. Commodity ETFs include spot gold and silver, crude oil, agriculture,
and precious metals, some of which are offered by several competing fund families.
New ETFs that track other commodities are constantly being created.
The Hazards of Contango
An inherent performance issue that is problematic for a buy and hold commodity
ETF strategy is directly a result of something known in futures trading as contango.
Contango is a condition that exists in the futures markets when the cost to buy the
next month’s contract (forward month) is greater than the value of the current month’s
contract or more specifi cally the current month’s contract price as it approaches expi-
ration. As the current contract approaches expiration, it gets closer and closer in value
to the spot price of the commodity until they approximate each other at expiration.
However, when contango is present in the market the cost of the forward month con-
tract is higher than the current month’s contract at expiration. The contango problem
is also a function of the disproportionate number of contracts that an ETF holds as a
percentage of the outstanding interest in all contracts for a given commodity.
When the commodities markets were much smaller than they are today, most com-
modities traded in a state of backwardation. Backwardation is the opposite of contango.
Backwardation exists when the current month’s contract trades at a discount to the
forward month’s contract. When a market is in backwardation it favors the commodity
ETF investor. However, for reasons beyond the scope of this book, it is now more com-
mon for commodity ETFs to trade in a state of contango rather than backwardation,
thus making long-term investing in commodity ETFs a dangerous proposition.
The contango problem arises each month when the futures contracts for the under-
lying commodity are set to expire because the fund manager must “roll over” the existing
contracts. Rollover refers to the process of selling the expiring contracts and simultane-
ously buying the next month’s contract. This is a mechanical trade that must be executed
by the fund manager in order for the commodity ETF to limit the potential loss expo-
sure in the futures market. It is also mechanical because it is mandated per the prospec-
tus of most commodity ETF funds. Remember, when trading futures it is possible to
lose more than the initial money invested due to the extreme leverage involved. Further,
and with rare exception, it is not practical or possible for an ETF to take delivery of the
actual commodity.
This leads to another problem know as front running. Front running is a trading
practice in which futures speculators and hedge funds actually fuel contango by short-
ing the current month’s contract that is set to expire while simultaneously going long
the next month’s contract, thereby driving the price of the current month’s contract
lower and the forward month’s contract price higher. Front running can also lead to
contango when hedge funds take physical delivery of the commodity. For instance,
many hedge funds lease oil tankers and take delivery of the physical commodity in
order to hold prices up and thereby force the oil commodity ETFs to purchase the next
month’s contract at a much higher price thereby creating contango. Since speculators

==================================================

Major Types and Families of ETFs 17
know when the contracts are set to expire (the expiration dates are set each month),
this generally exposes the commodity ETF to a guaranteed loss.
Therefore, if a fund can’t easily take physical delivery as is the case with gas or
oil then contango presents a constant problem. Why? In most cases it is not practical
or not permitted per the prospectus for an ETF to take delivery of the physical asset.
Therefore, the fund manager must roll the expiring contract over immediately and
pay the temporarily higher price. Again, this results in a guaranteed loss for the fund.
To illustrate the hazards of contango, take a look at the percentage-change chart in
Figure 2.1, which compares the prices of the E-mini Crude Oil Continuous Contract
and the United States Oil Fund ETF (USO) over a period of several years.
From its inception in 2006 through mid-2011, USO has fallen almost 48 percent,
but the E-mini futures Crude Oil Continuous Contract is down only 30.1 percent.
USO has underperformed crude oil futures by nearly 18 percent over a fi ve-year period.
A similar example of substantial underperformance can be found by compar-
ing the price movements of E-mini Natural Gas Continuous Contract versus U.S.
Natural Gas Fund (UNG), shown in Figure 2.2.
Figure 2.3 is a graphic that summarizes the dangers of contango.
Contango is the reason why long-term investing in commodity ETFs is an ill-
advised venture, with the possible exception of commodities for which it is easy to

take physical delivery. Gold and silver are good examples of commodities for which
it is easy to take delivery because they are inexpensive to store, require minimal stor-
age space, and don’t suffer from wastage or have a limited shelf life. Consequently,
precious-metal ETFs have performed well compared to their commodity cousins. The
charts in Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.5 show how much better these types of commodity
ETFs have performed, compared to those in which taking physical delivery is not easy.
The relative ease of taking delivery of silver and gold neutralizes the effects of
front running and contango. Precious metals require limited and inexpensive storage
space and do not suffer from spoilage or wastage. On the other hand, commodities
such as corn, cattle, and oil require huge storage facilities and constant upkeep, and
they suffer from wastage and/or a limited shelf life.
Unless the fund is able to take delivery of the physical commodity, the ETF is
virtually guaranteed to underperform its index due to the effects of rollover, contango,
fees, and front running.
A New Generation of Commodity ETNs—The
Fight against Contango
A new generation of ETNs (exchange-traded notes; more on the difference between
ETNs and ETFs in the next section) seeks to exploit and signifi cantly reduce the
negative effects of contango. There are two basic strategies being employed. The fi rst

involves the same practices used by commodity speculators: Go short the front-month
contract and long intermediate-term forward-month contracts. The fi rst of this type
product was unveiled in June 2010 by UBS. The concept is reasonably simple and
is described in the UBS ETRACS Natural Gas Futures Contango ETN as follows:
“Exchange Traded Access Securities (ETRACS) are innovative investment products
offering easy access to markets and strategies that may not be readily available in
the existing marketplace. The ETRACS Natural Gas Futures Contango ETN is
designed to capitalize on natural gas markets in a state of contango, as evidenced by
an upward sloping futures curve, while minimizing the exposure to absolute changes
in futures prices. The ETRACS Natural Gas Futures Contango ETN is linked to the
performance of the ISE Natural Gas Futures Spread™ Index (the Index)—Ticker:
GYY.” Here’s more about the index, and what it seeks to provide (from the web site
of UBS):
The ISE Natural Gas Futures Spread™ Index, through a series of investments in
natural gas sub-indices, effectively provides short exposure in front month natural gas
futures contracts and long exposure in mid-term natural gas futures contracts. This is
achieved by taking a 100% long position in the components of the ISE Short Front
Month Natural Gas Futures™ Index, which provides short (or inverse) exposure to
the ISE Long Front Month Natural Gas Futures™ Index and an aggregate 100%
long position in the components of the ISE Twelfth Month Natural Gas Futures™
Index, ISE Thirteenth Month Natural Gas Futures™ Index and ISE Fourteenth

Natural Gas Futures™ Index (33.33% per index), which provides long exposure to
the mid-term Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures (NG) futures contracts. The index
is rebalanced monthly before the Sub-Indices’ roll process to maintain the 1:1 ratio.
The performance of the Index is reduced by the Fee Amount of 0.85% per annum,
and increased by the Financing Payment. The Index was created in June 2011 and
has no performance history prior to that date.
Currency ETFs
Launched in the U.S. markets in 2007, currency ETFs enable investors to profi t
from changes in various currencies around the world. Like the trading of commodi-
ties futures contracts, the actual currency markets formerly required investors to take
large amounts of leverage to profi t from a small movement in the price of a currency.
Currency ETFs simplify the process and keep leverage more in line with that of tradi-
tional stock investing.
Dominated by the Rydex Investments fund family, the CurrencyShares family of ETFs
consists of eight products: Australian Dollar Trust (FXA), British Pound Sterling Trust (FXB),
Canadian Dollar Trust (FXC), Euro Trust (FXE), Japanese Yen Trust (FXY), Mexican Peso
Trust (FXM), Swedish Krona Trust (FXS), and Swiss Franc Trust (FXF). Combined assets
in these funds surpassed $1 billion in their fi rst year of trading. The FXE, which tracks the
price of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, is the most popular of the family.
Figuring the prices of these ETFs is relatively easy. Aside from a small percentage
of operating expenses, one share of FXE, for example, is equivalent to the price of
1 euro times 100.
As a whole, currency ETFs are popular with investors who like to take advan-
tage of changes in international interest rates, as well as geopolitical situations. Their
liquidity and simplicity is also a bonus for those who don’t want to invest the neces-
sary time in learning entirely new markets. Most important, currency ETFs tend to
maintain their trends (either up or down) for years at a time. This makes them ideal
for technical traders who look to profi t from steady trends.
Currency ETFs often realize most of their gains in the form of overnight gaps—
a potentially confusing situation. Since the actual currency markets trade 24 hours per
day but the ETFs trade only during stock market hours, their opening prices refl ect
changes that occurred overseas, when most investors in the United States were sleep-
ing. If you’re aware of this, it’s not a big deal because you can simply adjust your stop-
loss orders to compensate for opening prices that vary signifi cantly from the previous
day’s closing prices (gaps).
Inversely Correlated and Leveraged ETFs
The inversely correlated ETF is a rather innovative product and perhaps the most
revolutionary development in the world of exchange-traded funds since S&P’s launch
of the SPDR in 1993. This type of ETF, dominated by the ProShares fund family,

an ETF. Inversely correlated ETFs are tied to broad-based indexes such as the S&P
500 and Nasdaq, as well as industry sectors such as semiconductors or utilities, but are
constructed in such a way that they move in the opposite direction of the underlying
index. As the markets go down, the price of these ETFs goes up (and vice versa). This
is similar to selling short, but is done through buying instead.
So why not just sell short an ETF instead? The biggest reason is that cash retire-
ment accounts such as IRAs or 401(k) plans cannot use margin (leverage beyond the
actual cash value of the account); therefore, short positions cannot be established in
them. Nevertheless, with inversely correlated ETFs, investors and traders can essen-
tially sell short the broad market and specifi c industry sectors without having a mar-
ginable account.
Although most investors would never allow the situation to occur, actual short
selling can theoretically result in losses greater than the original amount risked. But
with the ProShares Short family of funds, one’s maximum risk is limited to the initial
amount of the purchase.
In addition to inversely correlated ETFs, the ProShares Ultra family of ETFs also
offers funds that are designed to move at double the percentage price change of the under-
lying index. These are known as “leveraged ETFs.” If the Dow gains 1 percent, the lever-
aged Ultra Dow30 ProShares (DDM) gains approximately 2 percent. The UltraShort
Dow30 ProShares (DXD) will gain approximately 4 percent if the Dow drops 2 percent.
Since most of the broad-based market indexes are less volatile than individual stocks, the
leveraged ETFs enable investors and traders to get a potentially higher return on invest-
ment. Just remember that leverage also works against you more when you’re wrong. The
Direxion family of ETFs also has a new suite of inverse and leveraged ETFs, but are
intended to be leveraged to 3 times, rather than 2 times, the underlying index.
At the time of publication of the fi rst edition of this book, leveraged and inversely
correlated (short) ETFs were in their infancy, and many of the subtleties and potential
pitfalls were not well understood by those selling or buying these products. However,
now that leveraged ETFs have been trading for several years and ample performance
data is available, many investors have learned the hard way that both leverage and
short selling (via inverse ETFs) are a bit more complex and carry more risk than what
may have been initially assumed.
To a large extent, both legislators and the media have vilifi ed leveraged and inverse
ETFs with little understanding of how they work or their stated purpose. Further, very
little clear and concise information seems to be available to the investor that explains
the appropriate use and potential pitfalls of leveraged and inverse ETFs. In reality,
these types of ETFs are neither bad nor all that diffi cult to understand. Further, if used
properly, they can be of great benefi t to a trader and protect or enhance the value of
any portfolio. But the most important concept to grasp when trading leveraged ETFs
is that these funds reset their exposure to the market on a daily basis in proportion
to the asset value of the fund at the close. Because they are reset daily, leveraged ETFs
are intended to be used only as very-short-term trading vehicles (typically one, or possibly
two days).

Major Types and Families of ETFs 23
Unraveling the Leveraged ETF Mystery
In the fi nancial markets, leverage is defi ned as the use of debt or exotic fi nancial
instruments such as options or futures contracts, to control more of a particular
asset than funds available would otherwise allow. Leveraged ETFs seek to provide a
multiple (typically 2x or 3x) of the return of a given index, currency, or asset but only
for a single day. At the end of each day these funds reset to refl ect the value for that
particular day. In other words, the value of the ETF is adjusted (reset) daily in order
to maintain the proportional exposure to the index, currency, stock sector, or com-
modity. As the name implies, “inverse” ETFs are designed to go up in value when
the index, commodity, currency, or underlying stocks decline in value. Conversely,
if the underlying asset rallies, the inverse ETF will fall in value resulting in a loss for
the investor.
To understand leveraged ETFs, one must fi rst understand the concept of daily
resets. The diagram below provides a very-easy-to-understand picture of how reset-
ting works. The concept is actually quite simple. On the day the ETF opens for
trading, an initial allocation of funds and the exposure of those funds are estab-
lished based on the daily performance objectives of the fund. Remember, the reset
occurs daily and therefore the fund’s performance objectives are intended to mirror
only the performance of the index by a magnitude of two or three times the move-
ment of the index for that day only (a single day). This holds true for both long
and inverse leveraged ETFs.
Table 2.2 presents a clear case for the dangers of leveraged and inverse ETFs
when they are not used properly. The table compares the performance of the S&P
500 index for the fi rst six months of 2009 to the performance of a 2x long ETF, a 1x
inverse ETF, and a 2x Inverse ETF. While the S&P 500 index was up 3.165 percent
over the six-month period, the 2x long ETF returned a –.68 percent return (negative
return), the 1x inverse ETF returned –8.91 percent, and the 2x inverse ETF returned
–21.68 percent. Clearly all three ETFs underperformed, based upon uninformed
wisdom. The compounding effect of daily resets led to disastrous results for a buy-
and-hold strategy. However, it’s important to understand that none of these funds
signifi cantly underperformed if compared to their stated objective of “mirroring the
index for a single day.” Clearly, leveraged and inverse ETFs are not intended to be
held for extended periods.

24 ETF Overview and Selection
Actively Managed ETFs
In late 2007, several fi rms fi led with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to
launch the fi rst “actively managed ETF.” Unlike the makeup of mutual funds, which is
determined by a fund manager who uses discretion to select the best stocks, ETF com-
position has traditionally been based on some type of underlying benchmark index.
Some companies, such as PowerShares, have taken ETF composition a step further
by using sophisticated computer programs to analyze and make slight changes to the
portfolio on a regular basis. However, prior to 2007 and the advent of actively managed
ETFs, human discretion was not used to select the stocks constituting an ETF.
Accompanied by a lot of controversy, actively managed ETFs seek to level the
playing fi eld between mutual funds and ETFs. Formerly, mutual fund managers
were not really worried about ETFs because they were all tied to specifi c benchmark
indexes, but companies in the process of applying for the fi rst actively managed ETFs
are causing a bit of concern for mutual fund managers who are afraid of losing busi-
ness to the awesome growth of ETFs.
Whether human discretion in actively managed ETFs will be approved remains
to be seen, but I believe the decision won’t make a big difference either way. Since my
strategy is based on technical analysis, the same patterns of relative strength and weak-
ness apply, regardless of whether the ETFs are actively managed.
Popular ETF Families
Most types of ETFs are offered through a diverse mix of fund families. Having a
basic knowledge of these families is important because it enables you to pick the top
performing ETF within each sector. This will be discussed further in Part II. Below is
a listing of the major ETF families on the market, as well as a brief overview of each.
Specialized families with only a few ETF products are not discussed here.
iShares. With more than 200 ETFs to choose from, iShares has the largest offering of
funds on the market. Issued by Barclays Global Investors, iShares ETFs include
the following types: broad-based, market segment, international, industry sector,
fi xed-income (bonds), commodity, and a few specialty ETFs. (See ishares.com for
more details.)
HOLDRs. Unlike the diverse mix of iShares offerings, all HOLDRs (products of
Merrill Lynch) are only for investing or trading in specifi c industry sectors.
Although only 17 HOLDRs exist, this family includes a couple of the most pop-
ular ETFs in the marketplace. The semiconductor HOLDR (SMH) is one such
example.
Despite their popularity, the HOLDRs have several important drawbacks.
First, each one was originally designed to have only 20 stocks in its portfolio and

for its portfolio to always include the same underlying stocks. Because the num-
ber of shares of each underlying stock never varies, changes in share prices over
the years has had the unfortunate result of certain companies within each sector
developing a very high percentage weighting within each HOLDR. Be aware
that lopsided, minimally diversifi ed portfolios often exist within the HOLDRs.
Further, note that HOLDRs can only be traded in increments of 100 shares, as
odd lots are not permissible.
Because of the problems above, specifi cally the lack of diversifi cation within
each ETF, the HOLDRs have been slipping in popularity among investors in
recent years (based on declining average daily volume). The HOLDRs seem to
have the problem of not being able to change to keep up with the times, which
is one reason why I rarely trade this family of ETFs in the Morpheus Capital
hedge fund. (See holdrs.com for more details.)
PowerShares. The PowerShares family of ETFs is designed in an impressively unique
way. Unlike many ETF families in which the underlying stocks rarely change, the
PowerShares ETFs use “dynamic indexing” in order to constantly search out the best
performing stocks within each index. Based on a sophisticated quantitative selec-
tion process, dynamic indexing enables the underlying securities to change on a
quarterly basis. The underlying stocks that comprise the ETFs of most other families
are designed only to change through acquisitions. Conversely, the dynamic indexing
of the PowerShares enables underperforming stocks within the sector to be auto-
matically replaced by the stocks with the highest gains within the sector. This often
enables the PowerShares to outperform other ETF families within the same sector.
As of mid-2011, PowerShares has 120 offerings, covering nearly every type
of ETF, including actively managed, asset allocation, broad market, commodity,
currency, fi xed-income, industry sector, and international. PowerShares is also
home to the quite popular Nasdaq 100 Index Tracking Fund (QQQ). (See inve-
scopowershares.com for more details.)
ProShares. Best known for its unique, inversely correlated “short” ETFs, the ProShares
family has created an abundance of opportunities for ETF traders and investors.
Its present offering of 121 ETFs is divided into three categories: Ultra (leveraged
at 2:1), Short (inversely correlated), Alpha (advanced investing strategies), and
Volatility (benefi ting from market volatility).
The stock market’s correction that began in July 2007 was a boon to the suc-
cess of the ProShares Short and UltraShort ETFs. At the beginning of 2007, the
UltraShort S&P500 ProShares (SDS) was averaging just 350,000 shares per day.
In September 2007, more than 15 million shares changed hands in an average
day. The other Short ETFs in the family have experienced similar growth rates.
Within just one year after their launch in 2006, the ProShares family of ETFs
had already surpassed total assets of $7 billion. Obviously, the concept has been
well received and the ProShares ETFs are here to stay. (See proshares.com for
more details.)

==================================================

26 ETF Overview and Selection
Direxion Shares. Following the release of the inverse and leveraged ETFs from
ProShares, this family of ETFs joined the scene. The main difference, however, is
that the Direxion Shares are leveraged to trade at roughly three times the perfor-
mance of the underlying index, not two. (See direxionshares.com for more details.)
Vanguard. Better known for its diverse selection of traditional mutual funds, Vanguard
offers a well-rounded set of more than 30 ETFs. The Vanguard ETFs primar-
ily consist of broad-based indexes and specifi c industry sectors, although there
are several international ETFs that encompass whole continents. Vanguard also
offers several fi xed-income ETFs. (See vanguard.com/jumppage/etfs/index.html
for more details.)
SPDRs. Under the umbrella of State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) are approxi-
mately 50 SPDRs (pronounced spiders). Types include broad based, market seg-
ment, industry sector, international, and fi xed income. Although it retains its
former StreetTRACKS name, the Gold Trust (GLD) is also part of the SSGA
fund family. Also managed by SSGA are two of the most popular ETFs on
the planet, the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) and the Dow Diamonds (DIA). As of
mid-2011, SPY was trading an average daily volume of more than 182 million
shares, down slightly from its peak popularity of 220 million shares in 2007.
(See spdrs.com for more details.)
Market Vectors. One of the newest players in the ETF world, the Market Vectors, by
Van Eck Global, offer a unique, concise group of funds presently not offered by any
other ETF families. The group of more than 20 ETFs covers industries from nuclear
energy to solar energy to coal mining to steel, as well as unique international ETFs.
(See vaneck.com/page_mv.aspx?Group=ETF for more details.)
Rydex. The most interesting family of ETFs from Rydex are the CurrencyShares,
which track the price of various foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Investing
in CurrencyShares is a great way to benefi t from currency trading without get-
ting involved with the foreign exchange (forex). Rydex also has a small selection
of broad-based, market-segment, and “equal weight” industry-sector ETFs. (See
currencyshares.com and rydexfunds.com for more details.)
Others. Additionally, there are a few other families of ETFs, such as Claymore, First
Trust, and WisdomTree, as well as a handful of niche ETFs, like U.S Dollar Bull
(UUP). However, many ETFs from these newer or lesser-known ETF families
are very lightly traded, and it’s not uncommon for ETFs to close up shop and
distribute assets if they decline too much in popularity. As such, I generally stick
to trading only the higher-volume ETFs and ETF families.

An Introduction to Exchange-Traded Notes
Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) were introduced to the fi nancial marketplace on June
12, 2006, by Barclays Bank. They were devised as a means to eliminate tracking error
associated with exchange-traded funds. Exchange-traded notes are structured debt
instruments issued by a fi nancial institution. A structured debt instrument is a type
of note that is customized for the benefi t of the buyer as an inducement to purchase
the debt. In the case of ETNs this might include features that could provide higher
returns or access to markets that the investor may not otherwise have access to. The
term structured also refers to the fact that ETNs track both a debt obligation and an
imbedded derivative such as a futures or options contract. ETNs share the character-
istics of both debt and equity investments.
Like ETFs, they trade during normal market hours on an exchange and track the
value of an underlying asset or index in real time. They offer excellent liquidity as they
can be traded just like an ETF or stock.
Unlike ETFs, they represent an unsecured debt obligation of the issuer. As such,
an ETN’s value is partially derived from the credit rating of the issuer and not just the
value of an underlying asset. Simply put, an ETN is valued based upon the underly-
ing value of the index (or asset) and the creditworthiness of the issuer. The likelihood
that the issuing bank will repay the debt is known as credit risk. Consequently, if the
issuer’s debt rating were to be downgraded, the ETN would fall in value even if
the value of the index (asset) were to go up in value. If the issuer goes bankrupt, then the
ETN would be rendered virtually worthless since it is an unsecured debt. ETNs do
provide lien priority for the investor but there is no guaranteed protection of principal
if the issuer defaults.
ETNs provide several advantages over ETFs. The fi rst advantage is that ETNs
don’t suffer from tracking error. Tracking errors occur when an investment deviates
from the performance of the underlying index, stock, currency, or commodity that it
is intended to track. For various reasons, this can occur with ETFs. However, since
ETNs are considered prepaid debt instruments there is no tracking error.
As a debt instrument, an ETN is a contractual promise by the issuing fi nancial
institution to pay the exact rate of return of the underlying asset/index less any fees.
Consequently, this eliminates tracking error. ETNs also provide a tax advantage over
ETFs. ETNs do not own any assets. They are just a promise to pay the investor a

stated return. Since no underlying assets are owned ETNs do not pay taxable inter-
est or dividends to the investor. Rather, all interest and dividends are rolled into the
index value. This eliminates ordinary income from the equation. All income is taxed
as capital gains and is not taxed until the ETN matures or is sold (taxes deferred). The
Internal Revenue Service has recently made exclusions to this preferential tax treat-
ment for ETNs that trade in currencies.

CHAPTER 3
The Top-Down Strategy
With so many types and families of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it could be diffi -
cult to select the ones offering the best profi t potential. In this part of the book, you
will learn a concise, top-down system of technical analysis that simplifi es the decision
process and increases your probability of a successful trade. The beauty of my top-
down strategy for selecting and trading ETFs lies in its simplicity. When day trading
was in vogue in the late 1990s, traders were obsessed with fi nding the magic bullet
that would give them the highest possible level of accuracy in their daily trading deci-
sions. Bollinger bands, oscillators, and the moving average convergence divergence
(MACD) are just a sampling of the numerous indicators that traders used, and still
use, in their quest for accuracy. Unfortunately, most traders and investors eventually
discover that using too many types of technical analysis leads to a bad case of “analysis
paralysis.” Rather than simply putting on positions that have a good chance of profi t-
able results, they spend all their time analyzing tickers for the perfect setup. This leads
to unprofi table inactivity. The most profi table systems of technical analysis are also
the most basic and effi cient. My top-down strategy is based on simple indicators such
as price, volume, trendlines, relative strength, and support/resistance levels. Further,
these indicators are applied in a logical, easy-to-follow order.
Preferred Time Interval of Trading
In preparation for applying the top-down system, you must fi rst determine your pre-
ferred time interval of trading; then use that interval to look for a trend. For example,
a day trader who buys and sells all his positions in the same day should not really care
about trends in weekly charts, and perhaps even daily charts. Conversely, a position
trader who typically holds positions for several weeks to several months should not
care much about trends on intraday charts such as the 5-minute or 15-minute inter-
val. In the middle is a swing trader who looks for trade opportunities with holding
times of several days to several weeks. An astute swing trader primarily uses daily
charts for most of the decision making but also uses longer-term weekly charts to con-
fi rm his thinking, as well as intraday charts to fi nd precision entry points.

The beauty of my top-down strategy is that it works equally well for all time inter-
vals. Examples throughout this book will focus on both swing and position trading.
The Top-Down Strategy Defi ned
The following is a basic summary of my top-down strategy for selecting ETFs, which
will be discussed in detail in the chapters following this one. The relative simplicity of
this logical process is illustrated in Figure 3.1.
Step 1: Determine the direction of the broad market trend.
• If the major indexes are trending steadily higher, nearly any type of ETF with
relative strength can be traded.
• If the major indexes are in a steady downtrend, seek out any ETFs with relative
weakness.
• If the major indexes are range-bound, avoid trading in broad-based ETFs that
track the major indexes.

==================================================

The Top-Down Strategy 33
Step 2: Find the individual indexes with the most relative strength or weakness (diver-
gence) compared to the major indexes.
• Compare the charts of industry sector and specialty ETFs with the S&P 500 or
the Nasdaq Composite Index.
• Buy ETFs in the sectors with the most relative strength if the market is
uptrending overall.
• Sell short ETFs in the sectors with the most relative weakness if the market is
downtrending overall.
As an alternative to the graphical method of looking at charts, use numerical
percentage-change market minders to identify relative strength or weakness.
Step 3: Compare all the ETF families within the specifi c index to fi nd the individual
ETF with the most strength (or weakness) relative to the corresponding index.
• Again, overlay charts of each ETF family with the corresponding sector index.
• Ensure that the ETF is also showing relative strength (or weakness) to itself,
closing in the upper 30 percent (or bottom 30 percent) of its intraday range
every day.
• Monitor changes in volume to confi rm institutional buying interest.
Step 4: Select the resulting long or short ETF position now most likely to outperform
the market.
• Use the strategies in this book to:
• Find the ideal entry points.
• Exit with maximum profi tability or minimal loss.
Step 5: Find the proper timing for a new position entry in the ETF most likely to
outperform the stock market.
• Use strategies in this book to locate ideal technical entry and exit points for new
ETF trades.
• Know how to manage overnight gaps in your positions.
• Trail stops based on trendlines and other technical indicators for maximum
profi tability and conservation of profi ts.
Determining the Direction of the Broad Market Trend
The fi rst step of my top-down strategy for selecting ETFs is also the most critical of
all the steps. Approximately 85 to 90 percent of stocks and ETFs move in the same
general direction as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Therefore, failure to
clearly identify the direction of the broad market’s trend before even considering which
ETFs to buy or sell short is a surefi re way to lose capital. Though it may be a cheesy,
worn-out Wall Street cliché, it will serve you quite well to always remember that the
trend is your friend.
To ascertain whether or not a steady broad market trend exists, I use a combina-
tion of trendlines and moving averages (MAs), both basic technical indicators available

==================================================

on most charting packages, on the charts of the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and
the Dow (hereafter, the “major indexes”).
The fi rst test any of the major indexes must pass is the “trendline test.” The num-
ber of major indexes that pass the trendline test determines how strongly an overall
trend is in place. The more broad-based indexes that confi rm the presence of the
trendline test, the more aggressive and confi dent you can be about trading and invest-
ing in the broad-based ETFs.
Whether or not a trend exists is, of course, dependent on the time frame you’re
analyzing. A steady trend may exist on an intraday chart with a 60-minute (hourly)
time interval, but not on the longer-term daily charts. By the same token, a steady trend
may exist on the daily charts, but not on the longer-term weekly charts. The following
example charts are daily charts, which are also referred to as “intermediate-term trends.”
In looking for an uptrend, draw a trendline from the last major low that was
formed on a daily chart, through the “swing lows” of each pullback within the con-
text of the uptrend. I prefer candlestick charts, but bar charts are equally effective.
A primary uptrend is defi ned as having three anchor points that coincide with at least
two “higher highs” and two “higher lows.” A higher high is formed when the price of
an index holds above the last signifi cant high upon pulling back from a rally. A higher
low is formed in the same way. The time frame of these higher highs and higher lows
depends on your preferred interval of trading or investing. Again, my examples focus
primarily on the daily charts.
Figure 3.2 is a daily chart of the S&P 500; the higher lows and higher highs that
form the trendline’s anchor points are circled. All MAs have been removed from the
chart so that you can more easily see the annotated trendlines.

==================================================

The Top-Down Strategy 35
To the dismay of long-term investors who only buy stocks and ETFs and never
sell short, the stock market regularly enters periods of steady downtrends. Fortunately,
my top-down strategy is designed to help you just as easily profi t by trading on the
short side in confi rmed downtrends or bear markets. Downtrend lines are merely
drawn in the inverse fashion of uptrend lines. Starting with the last major high, you
connect the subsequent anchor points on the way down, looking for a series of at least
two lower highs and two lower lows. Again, you want three anchor points to confi rm
an established downtrend. Figure 3.3 is a daily chart of the Nasdaq Composite that
meets the defi nition of a clearly defi ned downtrend.
Making sure the index has at least two higher highs and higher lows for uptrends
is important because it prevents inaccurately labeling an early, possibly premature
trend as a confi rmed uptrend. When an index has only one higher high and one
higher low, the newborn uptrend has a greater chance of failure because it has not been
established for a long enough period of time. Figure 3.4 is a daily chart of the Dow
in which an attempted uptrend failed because it had two higher highs but only one
higher low, equivalent to just two anchor points. Note that the failure of the uptrend
occurred when a lower low was formed. This was after the Dow broke below the lower
boundary of its annotated uptrend line. The long candle that immediately follows the
break of the trendline marks the lower low that formed in the second week of July.
If any of the major indexes passes the trendline test, you next use the 20- and
50-day simple MAs to look for confi rmation of the trends. Whether to use simple

MAs or exponential moving averages (EMAs) is largely a matter of personal choice.
Simple MAs give an equal weighting to every interval of the MA’s time period, while
EMAs give a higher weighting to more recent price movement. The debate continues
about which one is better to use, but it really comes down to personal preference.
Frankly, I’ve found there usually isn’t much difference between the prices calculated
using simple or exponential MAs.
To confi rm the formation of trendlines as defi ned above, the major indexes should
also be trading above both their 20-day and 50-day MAs. The opposite is true of
downtrends. If a quick glance fi nds this is the case, your work of determining if an
intermediate-term trend exists is completed. Move on to step 2 of the top-down strat-
egy, which is to fi nd the individual indexes with the most strength or weakness relative
to the major indexes. This step is covered thoroughly in the next chapter.
Often, the major indexes will rapidly attempt to break out from an extended
period of sideways, range-bound trading and form a new trend, either up or down.
When this occurs, clearly defi ned trendlines with three anchor points may form, but
the MAs may not necessarily confi rm the formation of the new trend.
In steady uptrends, the prices of the main stock market indexes should be above
the 20-day MA, which should always be above the 50-day MA. In downtrends, the
prices of the major indexes should be on the bottom, the 20-day MA in the middle,
and the 50-day MA above. Any variation of this scenario can provide warning signs
that the current trend may not be as stable as the initial glance might show.

==================================================

The Top-Down Strategy 37
First, be on the lookout for instances in which the 20- and 50-day MAs crossed
over each other’s paths in recent weeks. This usually occurs at least once when a new
trend forms or a trend reverses, but you don’t want to see multiple crossovers within
a short period. Further, make sure the 20-day MA is closer to the price of the mar-
ket than the 50-day MA. This applies both during uptrends and downtrends. The
presence of numerous MA crossovers or the 50-day MA trading closer to the price
than the 20-day MA can be warning signs of a choppy (not steadily trending), range-
bound market. This is no problem if you determine that a sideways market exists,
but it’s important not to confuse it with a steadily trending market. Remember that
the broad-based ETFs should be avoided in sideways markets. In steady broad mar-
ket trends, you should not see any recent crossovers of the MAs and the 20-day MA
should be closer to the price of the market than the 50-day MA.
Figure 3.5 shows an example in which a trendline has been established, as per the
previously discussed criteria, but the 50-day MA is closer to the price of the market
than the 20-day MA. There is also a recent crossover of the 50-day MA below the
20-day MA. This happened because a new uptrend was attempting to establish itself,
but was not yet confi rmed by the MAs.
When doing your chart analysis of the major indexes, don’t be surprised if you
fi nd the main stock market indexes are commonly not meeting the trendline and
MA tests for a clearly defi ned trend. Historically, the major indexes spend nearly as
much time in choppy, sideways ranges as they do in steady trends. Averaged over the
years, the major indexes have historically generated solid annualized returns, but that’s
only because the stock market tends to move swiftly higher in the uptrending years,
while doing nothing in the range-bound years. My “relative-strength” trading strategy,

discussed in the next chapter, enables traders and investors to fi nd profi table, low-risk
trading opportunities regardless of the overall market’s trend. Nevertheless, initially
identifying the primary direction of the trend prevents you from getting off to the
really bad start that would occur if you were to fi ght the overall market trend.
Uptrend, Downtrend, or Range-Bound? Now What?
The reason you identify the direction of the market’s overall trend, or lack thereof,
is so that you can position yourself to trade ETFs with the most relative strength in
uptrends, the most relative weakness in downtrends, or both in range-bound markets.
In markets trending either up or down, you can profi tably trade both broad-based
and industry sector ETFs with the same amount of ease. But in choppy, range-bound
markets, the sideways trend makes it diffi cult to profi t from trading broad-based ETFs
such as the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) or the Dow Diamonds (DIA). Therefore, in a
range-bound market you may want to focus on trading other types of ETFs that can
trade independently of the broad market. These include specifi c industry sector, inter-
national, commodity, or other specialized ETFs.
To determine whether or not broad-based ETFs should be traded, look for at least
two of the three major indexes to be in a confi rmed trend, as defi ned in this chapter.
Sometimes one index lags due to weakness in a key industry sector, but that’s okay.
Simply avoid trading in the ETF corresponding to that index. Knowing which of the
broad-based ETFs to select in trending markets is covered in the next chapter, which
discusses relative strength.
Sometimes, only one of the major indexes is trending steadily, but the other two
are not. This is usually due to an anomaly resulting from relative strength within one or
two industry sectors that institutions are accumulating. If, for example, mutual funds,
hedge funds, and other institutions are heavily buying the semiconductor sector, but
little else, the Nasdaq will likely show a lot of bullish divergence (relative strength).
This is because the Nasdaq is heavily weighted with semiconductor stocks. When this
occurs, you still label the broad market as being “choppy” and just focus on the indus-
try sector or specialty ETFs with the most relative strength or weakness. But as long
as at least two of the three major indexes are in confi rmed trends, you can trade the
broad-based ETFs effi ciently.

CHAPTER 4
Finding Indexes with the
Most Relative Strength
When the major indexes are in smooth and steady uptrends or downtrends, the broad-
based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be very effi cient trading vehicles. To profi t
in a smoothly trending broad market, you only need to identify which of the broad-
based ETFs have the most relative strength and then initiate positions in the same
direction as the trend. Over the course of an average year, the major indexes are not
trending steadily a signifi cant percentage of the time, but the top-down strategy works
effectively either way.
If the major indexes are stuck in range-bound periods, avoid new trade entries in
the broad-based ETFs. Attempting to trade them in such conditions will inevitably
lead to a high percentage of trades hitting your predetermined stop-loss prices while
you watch the positions subsequently move in the direction you originally anticipated.
The losses of each individual trade will be minor, but there will be an abnormally
higher percentage of losing trades. The end result is churning of your brokerage
account. Getting “chopped up,” of course, makes your broker happy, but it will even-
tually make you broke.
If the broad market lacks a steady trend, focus on determining which industry sec-
tors or other specialized indexes (international, commodity, currency) are still trend-
ing steadily, despite the lack of direction in the major indexes. Those trending higher
while the major indexes move sideways are identifi ed as having “relative strength.”
Sectors with “relative weakness” are those that trend lower while the broad market
moves sideways to higher.
Whether the broad market is in a confi rmed trend or range-bound, the next step
in the top-down process—fi nding relative strength—is basically the same. The differ-
ence is that if there is a confi rmed trend, you can look for relative strength anywhere in
the overall market, but if the broad market is range-bound, you have to exclude those
ETFs that are tied to the main stock market indexes. Again, any major type of ETF
can be effi ciently traded in steadily trending markets, but broad-based ETFs should
be avoided in choppy or range-bound markets.

40 ETF Selection through Technical Analysis
What Is Relative Strength?
If you’re already familiar with technical analysis, you may know an indicator known as
the relative strength index (RSI). The relative-strength trading discussions in this book
do not refer to RSI. Rather, the defi nition of relative strength here pertains to how one
index or ETF acts in relation to the broad market.
Relative strength is created when institutions focus their buying efforts on a spe-
cifi c industry sector or on the industries represented by a specialized index. The buy-
ing interest could be due to new technology within a specifi c sector, anticipated news
within a sector, or a variety of other reasons. Since the top-down system is based on
technical analysis, not fundamental analysis, the actual reason for the relative strength
is irrelevant. Your job is simply to fi nd it. Even on the lethargic, sideways days of the
S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, at least one or two specifi c industry sectors always
exhibit relative strength or weakness due to institutional sector rotation. The specifi c
ETFs tied to these individual sectors are the ones you want to trade.
If a sector index is moving in lockstep with one of the major indexes, such as the
S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, it does not have relative strength and should
probably be avoided. Rather, you want to buy or sell short ETFs in the sector indexes
acting more strongly than the broad market (in an uptrend) or sell short those that
are weaker than the broad market (in a downtrend). This is what is meant by “relative
strength” and “relative weakness,” respectively.
Mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutions have bylaws that require
most of their assets to be invested in the stock market at all times. They obviously put
their buying power into the sectors and indexes they feel have the best chance of price
appreciation. Conversely, they liquidate holdings they feel have a limited chance of
going higher. This constant movement of funds out of one sector and into another
is known as “institutional sector rotation,” and is the reason why at least one or two
sectors will always show relative strength or weakness in relation to the broad market
regardless of what type of trend the major indexes are showing. Sectors with relative
strength often generate double-digit percentage gains even while the S&P 500 and the
Nasdaq Composite are mostly unchanged.
During uptrends, the prices of stocks, ETFs, and sector indexes with relative
strength rise at a greater rate than do the broad-based indexes, while they also fall less
than the major indexes during periods of downward price movement. If a sector is so
strong that it simply moves sideways while the broad market is moving lower, what do
you think happens when the major indexes eventually bounce?
That sector will usually be the fi rst sector to shoot to a new high. If a new down-
trend suddenly starts, the sector with relative strength will also be the last to fall. This
is the one you want to buy: Not only is the upside profi t potential greater, but also the
downside risk is lower.
Just as you should look to buy ETFs in sectors with relative strength during
uptrending or bull markets, you should conversely look to sell short ETFs in sectors
with the most relative weakness during confi rmed broad-market downtrends. Sector
indexes with relative weakness will be the last ones to rise when the market rallies,

Finding Indexes with the Most Relative Strength 41
thereby reducing your risk on the short side. Further, the profi t potential is greater
because sectors with relative weakness will also fall at a faster pace than do the major
indexes during periods of broad-based weakness.
How Do I Find Sectors with Relative Strength or Weakness?
Your next step is to fi nd the best sectors for a profi table trade. Understand that before
searching for the individual ETFs with the most relative strength or weakness, you
must fi rst fi nd the sector indexes that are trending the most strongly relative to the
broad market. Then, you move on to discovering which of the specifi c ETF families
within the sector are showing the best chart pattern and/or strength relative to the
corresponding sector index.
You can spot relative strength (and weakness) within individual sector indexes two
ways: graphically and numerically. Both methods work equally well, so it’s just a mat-
ter of personal preference as to which route you take. Some traders respond better to
visual charts, while others are distracted by too many images and react better by just
looking at a table full of numbers.
The Graphical Method
For the graphical method, use your trading software to create a “percentage-change
chart,” which enables you to overlay the percentage change (not price change) of two
or more tickers on the same chart axis.
A standard stock chart shows the price of an index or ETF, along with optional
technical indicators such as volume, moving averages (MAs), and more. A percentage-
change chart is different because it shows only the percentage that an equity has gained
or lost during a specifi ed period, while ignoring the actual price in its scaling. When
you overlay more than one index on this type of chart, it becomes an excellent way to
quickly determine the relative strength or weakness of one index compared to another.
Specifi cally, you should use a broad market index such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq
Composite and overlay it with the percentage change of various sector indexes. By cre-
ating a separate chart of this type with all the major industry sectors, you can instantly
see which sectors are showing the greatest amount of positive or negative institutional
money fl ow for any given period. Then, simply buy ETFs in the sectors with relative
strength and/or sell short those with relative weakness.
Figure 4.1 is an example of a percentage-change chart showing hourly intervals
over a trailing fi ve-day period. This chart shows the S&P 500 overlaid with the Amex
Oil Index ($XOI) in late September 2007. Notice how, during this fi ve-day period, the
S&P 500 was essentially fl at, losing just 0.18 percent, but the $XOI fell 2.0 percent.
For trades with an average holding time of several weeks, you would most
commonly use the 60-minute chart interval shown in Figure 4.1. For trades that you
intend to hold longer, you would switch to the daily chart interval but still overlay the
industry sectors with the main stock market indexes in the same manner.

You can use the concepts of the technical ETF trading strategy throughout this
book equally effectively for trades with both shorter and longer time horizons. Day
traders, for example, might use a fi ve-minute intraday chart to see which sectors are
showing the most relative strength or weakness 30 minutes after the market opens.
Then, they can focus on buying pullbacks (price retracements off the highs) of the
strongest indexes throughout the day and/or selling short those with the most relative
weakness. Conversely, position traders who hold positions for many months could
even do the percentage-change charts with the weekly time interval. You can effec-
tively use percentage-change charts with any time interval, as the method for spotting
relative strength is the same regardless of the chart’s time interval. No matter which
time frame is used, the ability to quickly and easily see divergent trends with this type
of chart is impressive. Initially, the task of setting up your percentage-change charts is
time intensive. The good news is that it only needs to be done once. Once you’ve done
so, the charts will be dynamically updated, continually giving you a current snapshot
of the most relative strength and weakness within the broad market.
Six Steps for Setting Up Percentage-Change Charts to Find Relative Strength
1. Be sure your online brokerage fi rm provides the capability of overlaying the per-
centage-change chart of one symbol with that of another, so you can create this
type of chart. If not, I suggest opening an account for the purposes of doing so.
Search on the Internet for “direct access brokerage fi rms” to get a list of brokers to
choose from. I personally prefer the advanced technology and technical capabili-
ties of TradeStation, but many others will do the job just as well.

==================================================

Finding Indexes with the Most Relative Strength 43
2. Create a fresh layout or page to be used exclusively for your sector overlay
charts.
3. Determine your preferred time interval. If you are unsure where to start, I suggest
the hourly (60-minute) charts. From there, you can scale to a shorter or longer
time frame if you later decide it would be more suited to your style.
4. Begin by overlaying each of the stock market’s main sector indexes (as per the next
fi gure) with the most closely corresponding broad market index. For example,
you should overlay the Dow Jones (DJ) Transportation Average with the S&P
500, but overlay the technology-related Philadelphia Semiconductor Index with
the Nasdaq Composite. For spotting divergent trends the fastest, I suggest cre-
ating a separate chart for each of the sector indexes, as opposed to plotting more
than one on the same chart. Line charts are also preferable to bar charts, as it is
easier to spot the divergent trends with line charts.
5. Add any additional indexes for specialized ETFs that you wish to track. This
might include the price of the Spot Gold commodity (for the Gold ETFs), the
Euro-Dollar Spread (for the currency ETFs), or any variety of foreign indexes for
spotting opportunities in the international ETFs.
6. Finish by creating a chart in which the main broad-based indexes are overlaid
with one another, without any industry sector or specialty indexes. At a mini-
mum, this would be the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow, but
you can also include the small-cap Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 (or
include them on a separate chart). This chart enables you to quickly see which of
the major indexes is showing the most relative strength.
After following the above steps, you should be armed with one work space dedi-
cated exclusively to fi nding sectors and other specialized indexes with the most relative
strength or weakness compared to the broad market.
The Numerical Method
Examining the graphical work space described above is the easiest way to spot diver-
gent trends, but those of you who are mathematically inclined might prefer a slightly
different method of fi nding sectors with the most relative strength or weakness. This
alternative method also requires less bandwidth and does not require a software pack-
age that provides the ability of doing percentage-change charts.
The basic concept of monitoring all the major industry sectors is the same, but
you record their index ticker symbols, prices, and percentage changes on a daily watch
list instead. Then, you sort all industry sectors, and any other indexes you wish to
track, by percentage change. Figure 4.2 is a snapshot of my main industry sector
watch list, sorted by daily percentage change. I also maintain a separate watch list just
for specialty indexes, including commodity, currency, and international indexes.
Though there are hundreds of sector indexes available, I monitor just twenty to
twenty-fi ve of the main industry sectors at any given time. Certain “hot” industries of
the moment occasionally get added to my watch list as well.

FIGURE 4.2 Example of Industry Sector Watch List

Most of the columns in this sector index watch list are self-explanatory; however, the
column labeled “% Range” may not be. This calculation, which was done with the use
of TradeStation’s EasyLanguage programming capabilities, displays where each sector
index closed the day (or any time interval used), relative to that day’s range. This helps
confi rm that the sector is showing relative strength to itself, as well as the broad market.
With the top-down strategy, you need to see which sectors are showing the most
strength or weakness relative not only to the broad market, but also to themselves.
The closer an index is to the top of its intraday range when it closes, the more relative
strength to itself it is showing. Conversely, indexes that close near the bottom of their
intraday ranges are showing the most relative weakness to themselves. Using the graphi-
cal method, you can also spot an index’s relative strength to itself by noticing where
the line chart closed relative to its illustrated trading range.
As a rule of thumb, sectors showing relative strength to the broad market should
also fi nish in the upper 30 percent of their intraday ranges, while weak ones will often
close in the bottom 30 percent of their intraday ranges. The middle 40 percent of the

Finding Indexes with the Most Relative Strength 45
range is called “the danger zone,” as it often indicates a tug-of-war or balance of power
was occurring in the fi nal hours of trading. Without any clear indication of strength or
weakness going into the close, it can be more dangerous to enter a position at that level.
It is also important to distinguish between absolute strength and relative strength.
Looking at the screenshot in Figure 4.2, notice how the CBOE Gold Index ($GOX)
gained 0.64 percent on this particular day but closed in the bottom 25 percent of its
intraday range.
On a purely absolute basis, the $GOX was the second-biggest gainer of all the
industry sectors on my watch list, rivaled only by the 2.25 percent gain in the Amex
Networking Index ($NWX). Because it gained 0.64 percent while the major indexes
closed lower, the $GOX had relative strength to the broad market, but fi nished with
relative weakness to itself because it closed near its intraday low. On the other hand,
the $NWX showed the greatest absolute and relative strength by gaining the highest
percentage and closing just 20 percent off its intraday high.
The best examples of sectors with relative strength are those that not only outperform
the percentage gains of the major stock market indexes, but also close near the upper end
of their intraday ranges. The inverse is true for sectors with relative weakness that you are
considering for potential short sale. Sector indexes with relative weakness should not only
lose a greater percentage than the broad market on downward moves, but also fi nish near
their intraday lows.
Now that you have the necessary data at your disposal, the next step is getting on a
regular schedule to do the scanning. With my hedge fund, I look for divergent trends
each day after the market has closed. Longer-term investors may only need to look
for trend divergence on a weekly basis, while day traders will use very short intraday
chart intervals to look for relative strength during the trading day. The best way to
catch divergent trends and relative strength in its early stages is to become disciplined
at scanning your sector watch list at a regular, predetermined interval. The frequency
of doing so depends on what your preferred trading time horizon may be. Regardless of
the time horizon you trade, the strategy works in the same way.
After you become accustomed to scanning all the sector indexes, either graphically
or numerically, the divergent trends within the market will become readily apparent.
If the same indexes are showing bullish or bearish divergence every time you do your
scanning, a longer-term trend resulting from institutional sector rotation is probably
taking place. Again, the opposite is true of sectors with relative weakness. Buying the
sector ETFs with relative strength (bullish trend divergence) and/or shorting those
with relative weakness (bearish divergence) enables you to ride along on the coattails
of institutions who also realize the benefi ts of sector trading with ETFs.
What to Look for When You Scan
Once you’ve established a regular schedule of scanning your sector charts or price
table, you need to know exactly what to look for. As the strategy is top-down based,
you must fi rst note the overall trend of the broad market, as discussed in Chapter 3.

==================================================

46 ETF Selection through Technical Analysis
In overall broad market uptrends, the general idea is to identify the sector and
specialty indexes that gain a greater percentage than the S&P 500, the Nasdaq
Composite, and the Dow when these main indexes move up, as well as drop the
least percentage every time the major indexes pull back. Pay close attention to how
each index acts whenever the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite makes a move
within your preferred time frame. Sectors with relative strength should trend side-
ways, or even slightly higher, whenever the major indexes drop. Conversely, the best
sectors will rocket to new highs on the slightest bounce in the broad market. Both
the numerical and graphical methods explained above make it easy to spot relative
strength at a glance.
During a downtrend, you can spot relative weakness by looking for sector and
specialty indexes that drop a greater percentage than the major indexes do and that stay
fl at or move marginally higher when the overall market bounces. The weakest sectors
should barely lift off their lows when the major indexes rally, and should fall to new
lows on any broad market weakness.
Identifying the sector indexes with the most relative strength or weakness is easier
in range-bound or sideways markets than when most sectors are moving in the same
direction, which often occurs in steadily trending broad markets. The positive thing
about sideways markets is that trend divergences can be spotted with little effort.
In sideways markets, you can simultaneously be long the sector indexes with the most
relative strength and short those with the greatest relative weakness. When the broad
market eventually snaps out of its range and resolves itself in one direction or the
other, you can quickly close the positions on the opposite side of the trend. The gain
on the trade in the same direction as the resultant trend should more than make up
for the loss on the opposite side.
Sector Indexes with Relative Strength
Figure 4.3 is a standard fi ve-day chart of hourly percentage changes. It compares the
price action of the S&P 500 ($SPX) with the Amex Biotechnology Index ($BTK) for
the week ending September 7, 2007.
This particular week, the $SPX lost approximately 1.17 percent, but the $BTK
powered 2.62 percent higher. Relative strength in the Biotechnology Index was readily
apparent and could have been spotted with the relative strength strategy, even as early
as the fi rst day of the week.
In Figure 4.3, the letter A marks where relative strength in the $BTK fi rst became
apparent. Though both indexes rallied in the fi rst half of that day, the S&P 500 pulled
back in the afternoon. Nevertheless, notice how the $BTK did not pull back with the
S&P 500. Instead, it merely moved in a sideways pattern, closing the session near its
intraday high.
If you took advantage of that relative strength and bought one of the biotechnol-
ogy ETFs in the fi nal hour, you would have been quickly rewarded the next day. By
the close of trading on September 4 (B), the $BTK was showing a two-day gain of 2.7
percent, compared to a 1.3 percent gain in the $SPX.

Confi rmation of its relative strength and a second chance for entry into the $BTK
sector was provided the following day, on September 5. In that session, the $SPX sur-
rendered all the prior day’s gains to revert back and be unchanged for the week. Rather
than following the S&P 500 back down to the fl at line, however, the $BTK held fi rm
and merely moved sideways, holding tight to all its recent gain.
This action, on September 5, illustrates the beauty of the whole relative strength strategy.
When you’re positioned in the sectors and indexes with relative strength, not only are
your upside profi t potentials greater, but the downside risk is lower. Sectors and indexes
with relative strength are the last to fall when the broad market does, and they are also
the fi rst to build on their gains when the main stock market indexes recover, as can be
seen in this example at C. On September 6, the S&P 500 bounced to fi nish the day
0.5 percent higher for the week, but the Biotech Index zoomed another 1.3 percent to
show a weekly gain of 4 percent.
The $SPX fi nally fell sharply to close the week, bringing the $BTK down a bit
as well. Nevertheless, the $BTK still fi nished with a respectable gain of 2.6 percent
compared with the 1.2 percent loss in the $SPX.
Bullish divergences caused by relative strength will not always be as obvious as
this example. Nevertheless, ongoing experience of using your sector overlay charts will
enable you to learn the subtle intricacies of detecting relative strength way before the
“me too” crowd does.

Although you may want to use the hourly time interval for your daily scanning routine,
this example illustrates that the percentage-change chart works just as well for identify-
ing relative strength or weakness on longer time frames. Long-term position traders may
prefer to use the daily time interval on their chart overlays instead of the hourly.
Like the rest of the major indexes, the $SOX had been in a steady downtrend
since the beginning of May 2006, but a key difference is that the $SOX failed to
recover when the major indexes bottomed in mid-June of that year. On the con-
trary, it showed quite a bit of relative weakness that was easily spotted on the graph-
ical work space on which you overlaid all the sectors. Though I normally overlay
the $SOX with the Nasdaq Composite, I used the S&P 500 ($SPX) in this example
to show the major divergence between the $SOX and the benchmark S&P Index.
From the time the broad market formed its intermediate-term bottom on June 13
through July 10, 2006, the S&P 500 gained 3.5 percent, but the Semiconductor
Index lost 4.3 percent during the same period.
Because the Semiconductor Index is so heavily weighted within the broad market,
the chart in Figure 4.4 offers an explanation of why the broad market was showing so
much weakness in July 2006. Notice how the charts can be used to fi nd relative weak-
ness just as quickly as relative strength.
The fi rst clear sign of relative weakness in the $SOX occurred in the latter half of
June (A). The $SPX was only moving sideways during that time, but the $SOX was
drifting lower. If you did your scanning on a daily basis, this divergence and relative
weakness in the $SOX would have been apparent on the percentage-change chart
every day during that period. If you used the numerical method and examined the

==================================================

Finding Indexes with the Most Relative Strength 49
sector watch list, you would have also seen daily price changes of fl at to higher in the
$SPX, while the $SOX was registering losses. This would have provided the heads-up
that a short selling opportunity might be presenting itself.
If you missed the initial signs of relative weakness that the chart displayed in mid-
June, the bearish divergence became even more obvious on June 27 (B), when the
$SOX rapidly plummeted to negative territory for this time period, but the S&P 500
maintained its horizontal holding pattern.
The $SOX eventually bounced toward the end of June (C), but notice that it
failed even to rally back to its prior high. At the same time, the $SPX had broken
out fi rmly above its prior high. This divergence was yet another subtle sign of relative
weakness that gave traders another chance to sell short the $SOX into the bounce.
In the fi rst week of July 2007, the relative weakness the $SOX was exhibiting
fi nally came to fruition. While the $SPX pulled back only modestly from its recent
gains, the $SOX crumbled, dropping approximately 7 percent in just four trading
sessions.
Looking at the entire duration of the chart’s interval, notice how the Semiconductor
Index continually formed lower highs and lower lows while the S&P 500 was forming
higher highs and higher lows. This was relative weakness at play, as viewed in hind-
sight. Detecting it in real time was only a matter of scanning the percentage-change
charts for the sectors every day.
This chart shows once again how sectors that fail to rally when the broad market
rallies are the fi rst to fall on any subsequent weakness in the broad market.
Once the relative weakness is spotted within the sector index, the next steps are to
identify the best ETF family for short selling and then to time your entry. These steps
are covered in Chapters 5 and 7, respectively. Again, expertise in detecting subtle chart
nuances that scream early stage relative strength or weakness can come only with the
experience of scanning your percentage-change charts on a daily basis.
Specialty Indexes
In addition to monitoring the relative price performance of common industry sec-
tors in the stock market, you can track a host of specialty indexes (and corresponding
ETFs) as well. You may want to maintain two separate watch lists—one just for the
industry sector indexes and one for the specialty sector indexes. Specialty indexes you
might track include major international indexes and various commodity, currency,
and U.S. Treasury indexes.
In the last week of September 2007, the S&P 500 was basically fl at, but an all-
time low in the value of the U.S. dollar caused the euro, and many other currencies,
to rocket higher that same week. Along with the strength in foreign currencies, bull-
ish trade opportunities presented themselves in the CurrencyShares ETFs. Although
I normally overlay the actual Euro/U.S. Dollar Index (EURUSD) on the S&P 500,
the example in Figure 4.5 uses the CurrencyShares Euro Trust (FXE) in place of the
EURUSD. This makes the chart more legible because the index trades around
the clock, but FXE trades only during market hours. Again, the chart in Figure 4.5 is

a typical fi ve-day, hourly time interval chart used to fi nd relative sector strength across
the board.
Notice how the relative strength in FXE became apparent on the very fi rst day of
the week. On September 24, the S&P 500 fell more than 1 percent, but FXE barely
budged. The fact that FXE held fi rm while the S&P 500 dropped sharply was an
immediate indication of its relative strength. Based on that knowledge alone, you
could have taken a long position in FXE into that day’s close with minimal risk of
holding for a few days to see what develops.
As you know, if an index does not drop when the broad market does, it’s usually
going to be the fi rst index to surge higher when the overall market bounces. That’s
what happened in the four days that followed, as every slight upward move in the
S&P 500 caused FXE to cruise higher. Closing the week on September 28, FXE really
demonstrated its relative strength by rallying approximately 0.7 percent in the face of
the S&P 500 edging lower.
By monitoring a variety of specialty indexes in addition to the basic industry sector
indexes, you will see additional opportunities such as this constantly presenting them-
selves. One benefi t of trading ETFs in the specialty indexes is that they are often com-
pletely uncorrelated to the direction of the U.S. stock market. Most ETFs derived from
a basket of individual stocks are going to move in the general direction of the overall
market. The specialty ETFs, however, have practically no correlation because they are
driven by other factors such as changes in commodities prices or currency exchange
rates. Knowing this comes in handy when the main stock market indexes enter periods
of high uncertainty. The low correlation to the overall stock market lowers your risk at
such times.

Avoid Indexes Trading in Sync with the Broad Market
You’ve seen charts with relative strength and relative weakness, the former ideal for
buying and the latter ideal for shorting. In Figure 4.6 the Pharmaceutical Index
($DRG) closely follows the path of the S&P 500.
When scanning your sector indexes in search of relative strength or weakness,
many of the sectors you come across will be trading in patterns similar to those of
the major stock market indexes. Those should be avoided, as the technical “edge”
of having strength relative to the broad market is not present. Although the $DRG
gained 2.4 percent in this example, so did the S&P 500. The idea is to buy only ETFs
in indexes with relative strength and/or sell short those with weakness relative to the
broad market. Doing so will consistently decrease your risk and increase your profi t
potential.
Comparing Sector Indexes
In addition to overlaying sector indexes with the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite on
the percentage-change charts, keep in mind it is sometimes useful to plot the ticker
symbols of two different sector indexes with one another.
This strategy is useful if several indexes appear to be showing strength relative to
the broad market, but you are having a diffi cult time determining which one is the
strongest. The top ones you are considering can each be plotted against one another,
making it easier to weed out the underperforming indexes by noting divergences in
their chart patterns.

52 ETF Selection through Technical Analysis
Long-Term Relative Strength or Weakness
My average ETF trades are usually held for only several weeks, but very strong trend
divergences occasionally warrant longer hold times. The general rule in trading is that
longer hold times entail more risk but also present larger opportunities for profi t. This
is also a facet of what is known as a “risk-adjusted return.”
What you might consider doing is having two separate work spaces for scan-
ning relative strength within the sectors. The fi rst would be for your preferred normal
time frame of trading, while the second would be for any longer-term trades, such as
those you might place in an individual retirement account (IRA) or other retirement
account. When relative strength or weakness is spotted early, you can enter the trade,
and then simply move up (trail) stops to maximize profi ts as long as the trend diver-
gence remains intact. It may be only a period of days, or even less, but it could turn
out to be the beginning of a major trend that is found well before the general public
decides to buy many months into the trend.
Figure 4.7 is a weekly percentage-change chart that compares the percentage
changes of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Utility Average ($DJUA) from April
2004 through October 2005.
During the 18-month period shown in Figure 4.7, the $DJUA gained as much as
58 percent before fi nally correcting and losing its relative strength in October 2005.
By comparison, the $SPX gained as much as 12 percent, but spent much of the period
in a relatively sideways trading range.
Though it might seem like hindsight to look at the gains that were made, realize
that the bullish divergence in the utilities sector could have been easily identifi ed early
in the trend by daily scanning, as previously explained. The letter A shows where the

Finding Indexes with the Most Relative Strength 53
relative strength fi rst became apparent, as the $DJUA began trending higher and the
S&P 500 moved lower. When the broad market began to reverse later in the fourth
quarter of 2004, bullish momentum in the utilities sector increased as well.
If relative strength was identifi ed sometime in mid- to late 2004, a highly profi t-
able long-term investment move, based on technical analysis, would have been to
buy a utilities ETF such as the Utilities HOLDR (UTH) and then simply use a trail-
ing stop below the primary long-term uptrend line. Properly doing so would have
most likely kept an investor in the position until October 2005 because the primary
uptrend line was not broken until then, when the $DJUA set its fi rst lower low (B).
Even if you took several months to notice and act on the relative strength in the
utilities sector, which started to trend upward around June 2004, you still could have
bought a utilities ETF early enough in the trend to secure a large chunk of that long-
term 50 percent run-up. Throw in the considerable dividends that utilities ETFs pay
out regularly, and you have quite a nice appreciation. Who says utilities are boring
long-term investments?
Although the main stock market indexes are acceptable for trading in steadily
trending markets, remember they often lead to excessive churning of your brokerage
account in choppy or range-bound markets. During those times, focus on industry
sectors with the most relative strength (in uptrending markets) or relative weakness
(in downtrending markets) compared to the main stock market indexes. Using either
the graphical or the numerical method, you will quickly learn how to identify those
industries that are leading the major indexes in either direction; those are obviously
the sectors in which you want to be positioned. The next step is selecting the specifi c
ETF families with the most strength or weakness relative to the underlying index. This
is covered in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 5
Selecting the Best ETFs
After you determine which sector indexes are showing the most relative strength in
relation to the broad market, the next step is to select the exchange-traded fund family
with the best chart pattern or relative strength within the sector. The top-down pro-
cess of fi rst identifying broad market direction, looking for the indexes with the most
relative strength, and then fi nding the strongest ETF family within the sector ensures
that you are always focused on buying the best ETF of the hundreds available.
The process for fi nding the strongest ETF family within a particular sector is
essentially the same as identifying indexes with the most relative strength in relation
to the broad market. The difference is that, in this case, you use graphical or numerical
methods to compare the available ETF families within a specifi c sector to the actual
performance of the index with which the ETFs are associated.
Assume that the major indexes are all in steady uptrends. You begin scanning for
the sectors or specialty indexes with the most relative strength. While doing so, the
bullish divergence in the Biotechnology Index ($BTK) catches your eye. Because
the actual index itself cannot be traded, the next step is to compare all the associated
biotechnology ETFs with the performance of the $BTK itself. Just as you compared the
various sector indexes to the broad-based stock market indexes, you compare each ETF
family within the sector to the corresponding index. Either percentage-change charts or
a market minder will help you identify the ETF family with the most relative strength
or the best chart pattern.
Figure 5.1 is a percentage-change chart of the daily interval, trailing back over
a one-month period. On this chart, I have overlaid all fi ve of the currently available
Biotech ETF families, as well as the $BTK itself. The percentage gains are measured
starting with the close of trading on September 22, 2006, because that is when the
intermediate-term uptrend in the sector began. Your goal is to see which of the bio-
tech ETFs are performing the best within the context of the newly developed uptrend.
On the chart, match up each price line with the number in the legend on the top
left in order to see which ETFs showed the most relative strength during this period.
On your actual trading software, each line will be a different color, making it easy to
identify each ETF.
During the one-month period shown in Figure 5.1, the actual Biotech Amex
Index gained 16 percent. Therefore, you want to buy one of the biotech ETFs that

gained more than the index. Further, you want to buy the top performer. Note that
only one ETF, the First Trust Amex Biotechnology Index Fund (FBT), outperformed
the $BTK by gaining 16.5 percent. Relatively close behind was the PowerShares
Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Fund (PBE), which rallied 14.3 percent during
that period.
Ironically, the fi rst and most popular biotech ETF in the market, the Biotechnology
HOLDR (BBH), lagged behind the others and showed relative weakness. While the
$BTK gained 16 percent, BBH advanced only 7.8 percent during the same period.
Without fi rst comparing the other biotech ETFs, it would have been understandable
to blindly buy BBH simply because it’s the most well-known biotech ETF. Doing
so, however, would have been akin to buying relative weakness instead of strength.
Remember that ETFs with relative weakness will not only lag the index during
uptrends but will also be the fi rst to fall when the index pulls back.
Perhaps you’re wondering why BBH was performing so differently from the other
biotech ETFs. The answer lies with its disproportionately large percentage weightings
in just a few big biotech names like Genentech (DNA), several of which have lagged
the overall market. All the other ETFs have a better diversifi cation of stocks in their
portfolio, enabling them to at least keep pace with, or possibly exceed, the perfor-
mance of the underlying index.
Once again, notice how easily a percentage-change chart enables you to spot rel-
ative strength not only within sector indexes but within a group of tradable ETFs as
well. Without laying the performance lines of all fi ve biotech ETFs over that of the
Biotech Index, it would take a bit of work to see which one is performing the best. But
it takes only a matter of seconds to spot the bullish divergence using the percentage-
change charts.

Selecting the Best ETFs 57
If you can locate the strongest biotech ETF within what you have already identifi ed
as the strongest sector in the market, you’re stacking the odds in your favor for the trade
to move in the right direction. The last step is simply to ensure the proper timing for
entry and exit with your ETF selection, which is covered in detail in Part III of this book.
With experience in searching for relative strength on a daily basis, you will quickly
learn that, regardless of broad market conditions, it is always possible to fi nd one or two
sectors or specialty indexes that are trending independently of the major indexes. The
constant fl ow of institutional funds from one sector to another makes it possible to fi nd
profi table trading opportunities on both sides of the market at any given time. Your job
is simply to fi nd the action and then to become the shadow of the “big money” investors.
The simple concepts provided here for detecting relative strength can help you do it.

sector index, download your free Morpheus ETF Roundup guide at morpheustrading
.com. This will literally save you many hours of manually researching the available
ETF families within a particular index.
Know the Compositions of Various ETFs
As the previous example demonstrates, not all ETFs are created equally. Some ETFs
are highly concentrated with a small number of stocks and high percentage weightings
of the leaders, while others are highly diversifi ed with no individual stock comprising
more than a couple percent of the whole portfolio. In order to truly master ETF trad-
ing, learning how the fund families are composed is crucial.
Because there are so many fund families on the market, it would require a sep-
arate book just to explain the details of how the portfolio of each ETF family is put
together. All this information, however, is easily available in the public domain. On
the web site of each fund family’s parent company, you can fi nd detailed breakdowns
of not only the current stock portfolios of each ETF, but the manner in which the
stocks are selected.
As an example of how a typical ETF is created, look at the Semiconductor
HOLDR, the most popular ETF in the Merrill Lynch HOLDR family of funds.
Semiconductor HOLDR (SMH) is composed of 18 individual stocks that are part of
the Semiconductor Index ($SOX). Because individual semiconductor stocks can be
very volatile and whippy, trading SMH is an excellent way to capitalize on signifi cant
moves in the semiconductor sector without being subjected to the wild price swings
that individual stocks like SanDisk (SNDK) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) often have.
Table 5.1 provides a detailed look at the composition of SMH.
Here’s how to interpret this data:
• Company and Ticker: The name of the company and associated ticker symbol for
each individual stock included in SMH.
• Shares: The quantity of shares of each individual stock that make up one round-
lot order of SMH. A round-lot order is equal to 100 shares. In this case, the total

of 147 shares of stock that you see listed on the table equals the exact number of
shares that you receive by buying 100 shares of SMH. So, if you buy 100 shares
of SMH, you are effectively buying 22 shares of Texas Instruments (TXN), as
well as the number of shares listed for each of the 17 other stocks. When you
own SMH, you receive the dividends, when issued, from any stocks included in
it. Furthermore, you can actually request your broker to convert HOLDR to the
underlying. Be aware, however, that HOLDR can be traded only in round lots.
• Price: The closing price of each listed stock.
• Market value: The value found by multiplying the number of shares of each stock
times the last closing price. The sum of the portfolio’s market value will always equal
the current price of 100 shares of SMH. As of July 1, 2011, when this screenshot
was taken, the sum of the market value was $3,478.97. Taking that number and
dividing by 100 shares equals the current price of one share of SMH, which is
$34.77 (give or take a few cents for specialist spread).
• Percent weight: The current percentage of the entire portfolio represented by that
one stock. This percentage will constantly be changing as the market value of each
individual stock changes; however, the number of shares of each stock does not
change. For example, if Intel had a really strong day of price gain, but the rest of
the semiconductor stocks did not rally much, the result would be an increase in the
percentage weighting of Intel within the portfolio.
One effective strategy is to set up a group of quotes that lists each individual stock
within SMH. When trading SMH, you will fi nd that watching the performance of

the individual stocks enables you to get a better idea of the relative strength or weak-
ness of SMH, especially when the price of one of the stocks in SMH is being heavily
affected by company news.
It is a good idea to thoroughly study the components within SMH. Once you
begin to memorize the individual components and weightings of each stock, your
profi tability will improve signifi cantly because you will instantly know if a company
announcement is likely to lead to changes in stock value. If a company whose stock
has a low percentage weighting in the portfolio announces major news, it will have less
of an effect than signifi cant news from a company with a more heavily weighted stock.
Keeping track of the individual components gives you an additional edge.
With the plethora of ETF families that have come to market in recent years, it is
important to understand that the composition of the various families can vary greatly.
Some ETFs are designed to precisely mirror an actual index, others are weighted
heavily in only the leaders of each sector, while still others use computerized algo-
rithms managed in an attempt to outperform the corresponding indexes. Within the
industry sector ETFs, the biotech ETF is one group in which the percentage weight-
ings of stocks within an ETF family will vary greatly.
On April 12, 2007, the Biotech Index ($BTK) surged 2.5 percent and broke out
to a six-year high. At the time, it looked like the chart in Figure 5.2.
Although the Biotech Index ($BTK) broke out to a multiyear high, most of the
ETFs that track the Biotech Index did not do so. Remember that after identifying
the sector index with the most relative strength or best chart pattern, the next step is
to compare the individual charts of the various ETF families that correspond to the
underlying index. In this case, the fi ve ETFs are as follows: Biotech HOLDR (BBH),

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (IBB), PowerShares Dynamic Biotech
(PBE), SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), and First Trust Amex Biotechnology Index Fund
(FBT). Of the fi ve, only FBT broke out to a high along with the $BTK. While many
ETF families of other sectors consist of the same leading stocks, the biotech ETFs are
vastly different in the composition of their underlying stocks. The variance in their
composition causes signifi cantly different chart patterns to form within the group.
FBT broke out to a multiyear high because it is designed to precisely mirror the
stocks and percentage weightings of the $BTK itself. Twenty stocks make up both
the $BTK and FBT, and each stock has no greater weighting than 6 percent. The top
10 stocks in the index have a weighting variance of approximately 1 percent or less.
By comparison, BBH, perhaps the most well-known biotech ETF, presently consists
of only 16 stocks and is much more heavily weighted in only a few large-cap bio-
tech stocks. Together, Amgen (AMGN) and Genentech (DNA) currently make up
a whopping 60 percent of the portfolio. When these two stocks underperform the
$BTK, as they have done for quite some time, it’s no wonder that the chart of BBH is
rather bearish. As you can see in Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4, the daily charts of FBT and
BBH bear no resemblance toeach other, even though they both track the same sector.
Buy the Leaders, Not the Laggards
When I fi rst began sector trading in 1999, I frequently made the expensive mistake of
buying the stocks and ETFs that were lagging behind others within the strong sector.
My (faulty) rationale was that the leaders had already rallied “too much” and were

not likely to go much higher. I therefore assumed that better value could be found
with the laggards, which were bound to “catch up” to the leaders. On the surface, this
might have seemed logical, but I learned the hard way that it rarely works that way.
I remember one particular instance when I spotted incredible strength in the
Pharmaceutical Index ($DRG) shortly after the market opened. One of the big drug
companies had received positive news from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) regarding one of its key products, which sparked a rally in the sector. Thirty min-
utes after the open, I decided to get a piece of that strong institutional money fl ow into
the pharma sector, so I took a look at the stocks that composed the index. ETF choices
were quite limited at that time, so I opted for the individual stocks within the sector.
The leaders in the sector included companies like Merck, Johnson & Johnson,
Pfi zer, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Upon checking their stock prices, I noted that every
one of them was already showing a gain of around 3 percent or more within the fi rst
30 minutes of trading. Incorrectly assuming that they were “already up too much,”
I then looked to second-tier stocks within the sector. I liked the chart pattern in
Schering-Plough, and it was trading only 0.4 percent higher on the day. Thinking it
would catch up to the leaders, I bought Schering-Plough and then waited for my big
gains to fl ow in.
By day’s end, the sector leaders that “couldn’t go any higher” were showing aver-
age gains of 5 percent to 6 percent, approximately double the advance of when I fi rst
looked at them. My position in Schering-Plough not only failed to move higher, but
it actually moved lower to fi nish with a measly gain of just 0.2 percent. Such began my
lessons learned about buying the leaders instead of the laggards.

==================================================

62 ETF Selection through Technical Analysis
Although the previous scenario pertained to individual stocks, it could be applied
to ETFs. When you buy the laggard ETF within a sector, it will usually stay that way.
Conversely, the leaders will continue powering higher. Think of it this way: Cheap
stocks are cheap for a reason. Similarly, ETFs showing relative weakness do so for a good
reason: Traders and investors have no interest in the underlying shares. The reason the
ETFs are weak is irrelevant. All that matters is the price action (and volume, of course).
Leading ETFs within a sector are not only the fi rst ones to shoot to new highs
when the corresponding index bounces just a little, but they are also the last ones to
fall if the broad market suddenly reverses to the downside. Buying only the ETFs with
strength relative to the sector index, which is showing strength relative to the overall
market, is also a good way to minimize your losses when markets correct from strong
uptrends. Buy the leaders, not the laggards!
After you become experienced at detecting relative strength, it won’t be impor-
tant whether the overall market is going up, down, or sideways because you will know
that opportunities abound no matter what. Whether the Dow is at a high for one day
or many years, there will continue to be sector and specialty ETFs with strength or
weakness relative to the broad market. Using percentage-change overlay charts is an
effi cient way to spot the institutional money fl ow early in the trends.
Analyzing Volume
Besides price, volume is the most reliable technical indicator at your disposal for deter-
mining the true relative strength or weakness of an ETF. While price shows where an
ETF is moving, volume always shows the amount of power behind the price move-
ment. Because more than half of the market’s average daily volume is the result of
trading by mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional players, their activity
determines the overall direction of the market. Studying the volume patterns that
coincide with the market’s price movements is a way to understand with accuracy
what is really happening beneath the surface. Institutions can attempt to hide their
buying and selling activity in many ways, but their actions are always refl ected by
surges in volume within the broad market and individual stocks. Think of volume as
the footprint of institutional activity, which should be followed on a daily basis.
Analysis of volume patterns in the broad market, individual stocks, and ETFs is
also the most reliable, yet underappreciated, technical analysis tool. Ironically, volume
is the one indicator that both novice and experienced traders sometimes forget when
they become too wrapped up in analyzing trendlines, support/resistance levels, and
moving averages (MAs). No technical indicator other than price will predict the likeli-
hood of future price movements as much as volume. Some professional traders base their
entire analysis solely on price and volume, never even glancing at a single chart pattern.
The general concept underlying price-volume analysis is that rising price patterns
should be accompanied by increasing volume. This indicates that institutions, not just
mom-and-pop retail traders, are supporting the price movement. While such retail
traders play a key psychological role in the markets, they don’t collectively generate

                     PAGE 71                      
==================================================

Selecting the Best ETFs 63
enough buying power to counteract institutional activity in the opposite direction.
Therefore, if a market is rising on declining volume, driven primarily by just retail
buying, it requires only a small amount of institutional selling activity to counteract
the low volume rally. It’s not uncommon for a market to surrender several weeks’
worth of gains in just a couple of down days if the preceding gains occurred on lighter
than average volume levels. One day of institutional selling will typically wipe out
numerous days of retail-driven buying.
Conversely, falling prices accompanied by high volume indicates institutions are
rushing to the exit doors. When that happens, either stand clear of the buy side or join
it by selling short. Markets can fall sharply without an accompanying surge in volume,
but rarely will sustainable rallies occur on lower than average volume.
Detecting changes in the patterns of institutional buying or selling works incredibly
well for predicting changes in price. This is because volume is the one technical indica-
tor that never lies. Moving averages, trendlines, and support/resistance levels all work a
majority of the time, but there are occasional times when markets ignore these patterns.
Analysis of volume patterns works with accuracy all the time because it is a true
picture of stock market activity. Think of a car that looks fast and sleek on the outside.
No matter how cool the car appears externally, it’s not until you actually look under the
hood that you will really know whether or not the car is fast. The same is true of the stock
market. Noting the level of volume that accompanies a price movement in an ETF or the
overall market is akin to looking “under the hood” at the health of the market.
Finally, understand that volume is a leading indicator, not a lagging indicator.
Technical indicators such as MAs are known as lagging indicators because they simply
plot what has already happened. Because volume leads price, however, changes in the
market’s price are usually refl ected several days after changes in volume. It’s the volume
of trading that causes the change in the market’s direction; it’s not just an indicator that
merely shows what has already happened.
Analyzing the Volume of Individual ETFs
The average daily volume of an ETF is somewhat irrelevant because the bid and ask
prices automatically move in sync with the prices of the underlying stocks, regardless of
supply or demand. But even though ETFs are synthetic and not directly infl uenced by
changes in their underlying volume, taking account of volume spikes on days of strong
gains is a good way of confi rming the institutional accumulation within the sector. This
helps you to determine whether or not institutions are accumulating shares under the
radar. You can take this a step further by looking at the leading stocks that constitute
the ETF. You don’t use volume to select an ETF as much as to confi rm changes in price.
Rarely will an ETF have a sustained price breakout without a correspondingly
sharp increase in volume. Have you ever bought a breakout in an ETF or a stock that
you thought was a no-brainer because all the technicals looked good, but the breakout
failed anyway? Chances are that volume did not confi rm the price breakout by corre-
spondingly spiking higher. This occurs because it only takes a small number of buyers
or sellers jumping into the market to move prices in the opposite direction of the trend.

64 ETF Selection through Technical Analysis
Once those buyers or sellers are done, however, prices will often revert back to where
they previously were, thereby causing a lack of follow-through and choppy conditions.
Any trends that form on light overall market volume must be taken with a grain of
salt and an extra ounce of caution. The same thing often happens on the downside.
Sell-offs and breaks of support often do not follow through if the volume does not
simultaneously increase.
When analyzing the volume of an ETF, you should be more interested in how
much volume it is trading relative to itself, not just how much volume it trades in abso-
lute terms. For example, it doesn’t matter whether one of the iShares family of ETFs
normally trades 100,000 shares per day or 3 million shares per day. What is important
to look at is how the session’s volume compares with the average daily volume. If the
ETF has an average daily volume of 500,000 shares, but has already traded 400,000
shares within the fi rst hour of trading, it indicates very high volume relative to itself,
and the ETF will probably end up trading two to three times its average daily volume.
As a rule of thumb, you want to see ETFs breaking out of bases of consolidation on at least
200 percent to 300 percent of their average daily volume levels.
Analyzing the Volume of the Broad Market
I monitor the total volume in both the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the
Nasdaq stock exchange every day and look to see if bullish or bearish prices are con-
fi rmed. If on a given day the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite registers gains on higher
volume, it is known as an accumulation day, which indicates institutional buying. When
the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite sells off at higher volume, it is known as a
distribution day, which indicates institutional selling. Healthy markets can normally
absorb a couple of distribution days within a one-month period, but the presence of
fi ve or more such distribution days can put even the strongest of uptrends in danger
of breaking down. Conversely, downtrends often end when the markets suddenly start
posting accumulation days after a series of higher-volume losing sessions.
In monitoring the volume of the overall market, you are not only looking to con-
fi rm bullish or bearish price action; you also want to know whether volume levels are
high enough for trends to be sustainable. Because volume leads price, thin market
volume tends to create choppy markets and to cause trends to reverse easily.
Average or heavy volume causes sustainable trends to form and enables the market
to follow through. Even if a small group of sellers jumps into the market during a high
volume uptrending day, the uptrend will usually continue because there are enough buy-
ers to absorb the selling volume. If you have ever watched an ETF trend up the entire
day without even a minor pullback, even when the overall market was weak, chances
are that the underlying components of the ETF were probably trading on very high
volume that day. This enabled the ETF to maintain its relative strength even when sell-
ers stepped in. This is what I mean by volume confi rming relative strength or weakness.
The same thing is true of downtrending indexes in that the downtrend is more likely to
continue if the sell-off is on heavy, or at least average, volume. This indicates there are
enough sellers to continue the downward momentum even if some buyers step in.

Selecting the Best ETFs 65
To determine whether total market volume is heavier or lighter than average, you
plot both a 5-day MA and a 50-day MA to look for changes in volume. The 5-day MA
shows you the average daily volume for the past fi ve trading days, which is a good time
horizon for indicating short-term changes in volume. In general, you want to trade
more aggressively when the total market volume is above the 5-day MA because this
indicates a short-term increase in volume, which typically leads to continued follow-
through in pricing. However, when total volume is below the 5-day MA, the result is
usually a lack of direction and less desirable trading conditions. The 50-day MA gives a
longer-term view of volume, which is useful in confi rming multimonth trends (or lack
thereof). You can also use the crossover of the two MAs as an indicator of a change in
sentiment. When the 5-day MA is above the 50-day MA, it typically indicates a more
sustained increase in volume. But, if the 5-day MA is below the 50-day MA, it points
to a sustained period of decreased volume (and hence a lack of interest). Figure 5.5 is
a daily chart of the Nasdaq total market volume, along with the MAs just discussed.
Notice how the 5-day MA is slowly drifting further away from the 50-day MA.
This indicates a steadily increasing lack of interest in the markets, which will continue
to make trading diffi cult until that trend changes. Also notice how only one out of
the last eight trading days has been above the 5-day MA. Generally, it is not wise to be
aggressive in the markets when volume is below the 5-day MA.
Figure 5.6 is a clear example of why markets are diffi cult to trade during light-
volume periods. It is a 15-minute chart of trading volume for the S&P 500 futures
in mid-February 2003, as the broad market was trying to form a long-term bottom.

Looking at the above chart, notice how at around 1:15 p.m. EST on February
12 the 822 support level (as indicated by the dashed horizontal line) was tested three
times and broke to a new low. This should have caused the S&P 500 futures (and
SPY) to sharply and quickly collapse to a new low. Instead, the futures deliberated
and actually rallied back above the downtrend line from the two days before. Then,
after everyone was forced to close their short positions, the market eventually sold
off and set new lows, though the futures only dropped four points below the sup-
port level. This was all the result of light market volume. Looking at the entire day, it
looks like the 20-period MA on the 15-minute chart formed resistance for a smooth
and steady downtrend. But a closer look on a shorter time frame indicates why it was
tricky to stay short in the afternoon.
Analyzing Intraday Volume
Although daily charts are great for studying volume over a period of several days to
one week, they do not work very well for assessing intraday volume. To analyze volume
change from one day to another, switch to an intraday chart, which is usually based
on a 15-minute period, and simply compare volume based on the time of day. You do
this by measuring the volume after a specifi ed number of bars, each of which represents
15 minutes. For example, if it is 10:30 a.m. EST, you would simply look at the total
volume after the fi rst four 15-minute bars and compare it with the volume represented
by the fi rst four 15-minute bars of the previous day. Figure 5.7 illustrates this.
Intraday volume comparisons, as illustrated in Figure 5.7, give an early indica-
tion of whether volume is on track to exceed the previous day’s volume. If volume is
already well above the previous day’s level by a specifi ed intraday period, it tells you
that trading is likely to exceed the previous day’s level by the end of the day. If that

Selecting the right sector index with the most strength relative to the broad mar-
ket is a major key to positioning yourself in the best ETFs. However, the numerous
choices among ETF families within each sector index now mandates that you ensure
that you are also positioned in the specifi c ETF with the most strength relative to the
index. In the top-down system of relative strength trading, remember that you are fi rst
looking for the sector indexes with the most relative strength compared to the market
and then looking for the specifi c ETFs with the most relative strength compared to the
sector index. Then, you look for the confi rmation of the volume.

Trading ETFs: Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis, Second Edition
by Deron Wagner
Copyright © 2012 Deron Wagner
CHAPTER 6
Supplementing the Basics
Now that you understand the essential methodology behind the top-down strategy,
this chapter will discuss additional chart patterns and technical indicators that can
supplement the basic concepts. Some traders may already be familiar with the pat-
terns and indicators discussed in this chapter but may have never applied them to the
analysis ofexchange-traded funds.
Using Multiple Time Frames for Confi rmation
Regardless of whether you are a short-term day trader or a long-term position trader,
the use of multiple time frames for technical confi rmation is one more tool you can
add to your ETF trading arsenal in order to shift the odds more in your favor.
Upon selecting the best ETF for a new trade entry, one fi nal step is to compare its
chart pattern on several time frames. If you’re a long-term trader, you may want to use
the hourly, daily, and weekly charts. Intraday traders could similarly use the 5-minute,
15-minute, and hourly charts. The best possible trade setups will show confi rmation
across all time frames.
For a long setup, this might mean the ETF is showing support of its uptrend line on
the hourly chart, consolidating near the highs on the daily chart, and nearing the lower
channel support of its weekly uptrend line. If all the time frames confi rm one another in
this manner, your odds for a profi table trade are much higher. Nevertheless, confl icting
signals occasionally occur, as when one chart looks bullish but the other looks bearish or
maybe is looking a bit shaky. This might happen when an ETF has broken below sup-
port of its hourly uptrend line, but is coming into support of its 50-day moving average
(MA), or its primary intermediate-term uptrend line.
When chart patterns confl ict with one another, the important thing to remember
is that the longer time frame always holds more sway than the shorter one. Therefore, if the
hourly chart doesn’t look too hot, but the daily chart looks great, the daily chart will gen-
erally hold more weight. Similarly, a weekly chart holds more weight than a daily chart.
In my early years as a trader, I often found myself in a position that I thought
looked pretty good on the chart on which I based my analysis. The stock would often
have broken out above a major area of resistance, volume was high, and the MAs on
69

my chart were all in line. Despite everything looking good, the position would often
attempt to rally and then fi zzle out just as quickly. It took me quite a long time to fi gure
out what the problem was. I was simply failing to look at charts of the more signifi cant,
longer time frames. There was a lack of confi rmation on multiple time frames.
If you fi nd yourself in a position in which the shorter time frame looks good, but
the longer time frame does not confi rm it, I suggest being more conservative with
regard to taking profi ts. Rather than maximizing gains through the use of trailing
stops (see Chapter 8), consider selling into strength when the ETF tests resistance on
its longer time frame chart. Short positions should be closed into weakness on a test
of the longer-term support levels, even if the shorter-term charts still look bearish.
Understanding Consolidations
When an ETF is oscillating in a choppy, indecisive range within the context of a
broad market that is also in a sideways range, it’s really a matter of chance as to which
direction the ETF will eventually resolve itself. However, periods of price volatility
contractions near the highs or lows of a trading range tell a different story. These are
known as consolidations and can be either bullish or bearish, depending on where in
the range they lie.
If an ETF is bouncing around in a sideways range of 3 to 4 points and suddenly
spends a week or more within a much tighter range of 1 to 2 points, check to see if
that consolidation is also near the upper or lower end of the overall trading range.
If near the top of a range, it is known as a “bullish consolidation,” which will usu-
ally resolve itself fi rmly to the upside. If near the bottom of a range, it’s a “bearish
consolidation,” which will typically lead to lower prices. Identifying these periods
of consolidation creates trading opportunities that often lead to swift, short-term
moves in one direction or the other. You want to buy the bullish consolidations as
soon as they move above the high of the recent range, or sell short the bearish consoli-
dations when they fall below the lows of the recent range.
Periods of consolidation occur not only within sideways ranges, but also within
the context of established trends. In an uptrend, an ETF typically corrects by pulling
back (retracing) from its highs, touching a key support level such as the MA or trend-
line, and then moving higher in the direction of the established trend. Nevertheless,
ETFs showing a lot of relative strength may not pull back when the broad market
does. Instead, they often enter a period of price consolidation known as a “correction
by time.” A pullback, the more common form of an ETF digesting its gains, is known
as a “correction by price.”
Of the two, a correction by time is more bullish because it indicates the demand
is so strong that traders did not even sell the position when the overall market dipped
lower. Instead, the buyers merely dried up, but supply did not increase. The fi rst sub-
sequent move higher in the overall market normally causes the ETF that is correcting
by time to surge higher, above the range of consolidation. An ETF that has pulled
back should also move higher, but will have overhead supply to contend with from the

retracement off the high. That is, whenever a stock pulls back from the high, investors
who bought at higher levels will be looking to sell into the strength of any bounce
toward their original entry price, which creates what is known as “overhead supply.”
In downtrends, the opposite scenario is equally bearish. With consolidations, there are
a few points to be aware of.
The longer the period of consolidation, the stronger the eventual breakout will be.
Furthermore, the longer the consolidation, the more likely the trend will resolve itself
in that direction. While bullish consolidations are forming, institutions are accumu-
lating (or distributing shares during bearish consolidations). This creates a thick layer
of price support that acts as a base to propel the position higher when the breakout
comes.
The longer the consolidation, the more likely the subsequent breakout will “stick”
(hold at the highs without retracing back below the pivotal breakout level). Shorter
periods of consolidation have a higher tendency to fail their breakout attempts.
Therefore, you want to search for ETFs that have been consolidating for at least sev-
eral weeks, and then buy the ETF on the breakout above the range. Chapters 9 and
10 will walk you through numerous actual trade examples in which this played out.
Short Selling the Head-and-Shoulders Chart Pattern
Although technical stock traders have been familiar with the head-and-shoulders
(H&S) chart pattern for years, many do not realize the pattern works just as effectively
with ETFs. Over the years, my most profi table ETF short sales were often the result
of capitalizing on this pattern. First, begin by looking at the basic diagram of a head-
and-shoulders pattern in Figure 6.1.
A head-and-shoulders pattern is a bearish reversal chart pattern that often marks
the top of an uptrend and predicts a sell-off in a particular index or ETF. The left
shoulder and head are formed as the index is rallying; at this point the pattern does not
yet indicate anything bearish. However, the fi rst indication that the buying momen-
tum may be fading is when the neckline is formed on the right side of the head. Rather

than setting a higher low on the previous rally of the head, the index sells off all the
way down to the prior low. When this occurs, people who bought near the top (the head)
are now trapped in the long position. Then, as another wave of buyers attempts to
rally the index, the people who are trapped long at the top sell into the rally in an
attempt to “just break even.” This weakens the index even more, which prevents the
achievement of a higher high, and also forms the right shoulder. As the index comes
back down once again and tests the prior low, this usually marks a break of the uptrend
line. At this point, everyone who bought on the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder
are now trapped and out of the money on their positions. As such, they begin to sell,
causing a break of the neckline, which subsequently attracts new short sellers. In turn,
this often leads to a rapid and volatile collapse of the price due to selling momentum.
Although the most ideal entry point for shorting an H&S pattern can be debated,
I prefer to enter after the right shoulder has formed and the price starts heading back
down to the neckline. Entering before the right shoulder is formed is not advisable, as
there is not yet enough confi rmation that the uptrend has broken. Selling short posi-
tions too soon will inevitably lead to a greater percentage of “stop outs” (when you are
forced to close the trade at a loss) than you would prefer. Nevertheless, a short entry
during the formation of the right shoulder provides you with a very positive risk/
reward ratio because a relatively tight stop can be placed just over the top of the head,
thereby creating much greater profi t potential on a downward move than the risk of
getting stopped out if the pattern does not follow through. If the H&S fails to move
back down to the neckline and follow through, losses are reduced because of shorting
at a low-risk price.
The other school of thought is that it’s better to wait for a defi nitive break of the neck-
line before selling short. The benefi t of waiting for such confi rmation is that the pattern
will have a greater chance of actually following through to the downside, but the negative
is that stops must be given more wiggle room: The protective stop-losses must be placed
further away from the actual market price to prevent closing the trade at the least ideal
place. This diminishes the risk/reward ratio.
When an H&S drops below the neckline (which, by the way, is sometimes slightly
ascending or descending), the predicted sell-off amount is equal to the distance from
the top of the head down to the neckline. So, if the price at the top of the head is
$100 and the price at the neckline is $90, the predicted drop would be equal to $10
($100 – $90) below the neckline. Since the neckline is $90, the predicted sell-off
would be a target price of $80. This guideline is handy for determining a price target
for taking profi ts when selling short this pattern.
Although H&S patterns follow through a majority of the time, there are many
occasions when the pattern fails, meaning that it never drops below the neckline after
forming the right shoulder. The pattern is said to have failed when the price rallies
above the high of the head, after forming the right shoulder. When this happens, be
sure to quickly cut losses if short. Failed H&S patterns tend to have very powerful
upward moves because all the traders who sold the pattern must close their short
positions. Also, buyers who were previously shaken out reenter their positions on the
breakout above the high. This leads to failed H&S patterns being great long setups

due to the sudden reversal of momentum that results from the simultaneous closing of
short positions and bulls reentering their position over the highs. Figure 6.2 illustrates
failure on an H&S pattern.
As always, volume is a great indicator to assist you in determining the probability
of the H&S properly following through to the downside. As with every other type of
chart pattern, volume is one of the most reliable indicators, and this pattern is no
different. Specifi cally, you are looking for lighter volume during the formation of the
right shoulder rather than during the formation of the left shoulder. If volume on
the right shoulder is signifi cantly less than that on the left shoulder, it tells you that
fewer buyers are interested in moving the market back up. This increases the probabil-
ity of the price at least coming back down to test the neckline. Conversely, increasing
volume on the right shoulder is often a warning sign that the bearish pattern may not
follow through, putting you on the alert with short positions if the price nears the top
of the head.
The amount of time it takes an ETF to complete the breakdown of the H&S pat-
tern is largely dependent on the time frame of the setup. For example, an H&S pattern
that sets up on a 5-minute intraday chart will usually follow through and complete the
sell-off within a few hours. An H&S on an hourly chart will usually require several
days to a week to complete the predicted drop. An H&S on a daily chart will typically
take several weeks to follow through. Therefore, if you are selling short an H&S on a
daily chart, be sure to allow the setup a signifi cant amount of time and price volatil-
ity. Otherwise, stops might be triggered prematurely. H&S patterns that occur on
the hourly time frame have a higher reliability of following through. These setups are
often the source of ETF short sales during bearish markets or reversal periods.
If you fl ip the chart of an H&S upside down, you will see a bullish pattern known
as an “inverse head and shoulders.” The psychology behind why the pattern works is
the opposite of what I described earlier. As with the bearish H&S pattern, you can
take long entries on an inverse H&S during the formation of the right shoulder. Stops
should be just below the bottom of the head (or closer), and the predicted upward
move also should be equal to the distance from the head to the neckline. Figure 6.3 is
an illustration of the inverse H&S pattern.

Figure 6.4 is a clear example of an H&S pattern in the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) that
followed through to the downside. The chart was originally created on September 16,
2002, while the right shoulder was being formed. Note that I have removed the usual
MAs so that you can more easily see the H&S pattern.
When I initially analyzed this chart, SPY had already formed the right shoulder
and was testing the neckline of the pattern. Although it was a good sign that SPY
had already moved down to the neckline, one disadvantage was that the neckline was
ascending. In a perfect H&S pattern, the neckline would be horizontal. An ascending

neckline is somewhat bullish because it indicates traders did not drive the price all the
way back down to the lows of the left shoulder. Conversely, a descending neckline is
more bearish because the low of the left shoulder was violated on the fi rst test of its
support.
On the bearish side, the volume patterns were promising. During the formation
of the left shoulder, notice how volume was relatively heavy, coming in above its
50-day MA (A). Then, when the head and right shoulder were being formed, volume
dropped off signifi cantly (B and C, respectively). Lighter volume at points B and C
shows reluctance on the part of institutions to support the market when it attempted
to recover after the formation of the left shoulder. Overall, there was enough going
for the pattern that I anticipated good odds of breaking the neckline and following
through to the downside.
If the SPY chart (Figure 6.4) broke the neckline, the predicted downside price
target would be roughly equivalent to the distance from the top of the head down to
the neckline. As the neckline was ascending, you could not get a very concise measure-
ment. Still if you had measured from the top of the head down to the neckline at the
point that preceded the formation of the right shoulder, the price target would have
worked out to be in a range of about 10 points ($97–$87). Ten points below the neck-
line value of $87 gave a projected price target of approximately $77. Fast-forwarding
one month later, take a look at what happened (Figure 6.5).

As you can see, SPY fell all the way down to the projected target of $77 and then
reversed sharply after forming a double bottom with the July 2002 low. Coincidentally,
the October low also marked the end of the 2000–2002 bear market.
If you sold short SPY around the middle of the right shoulder and placed a pro-
tective stop above the top of the head, the trade would have netted you a gain of
approximately 14 points, while limiting initial risk to around 6 points. This translates
into a reward/risk ratio of more than 2 to 1, the minimum ratio to look for with all
long and short setups. By taking only trades with a reward/risk ratio of at least 2 to 1,
you can have a batting average of 50 percent or less but still consistently be a net
profi table trader.
A very similar instance of a head-and-shoulders pattern that followed through
perfectly is shown on the daily chart of the iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM)
from September through November 2007 (Figure 6.6). The left shoulder formed in
September, while both the head and right shoulder formed in October. By the end of
November, IWM had fallen all the way to its predicted downside target, the distance
from the top of the head down to the neckline. This also coincided with a perfect test
of the prior low from September 2007 (the dashed horizontal line).
The 200-Day Moving Average Brick Wall
When analyzing intraday, daily, and weekly charts, the MAs that come into play
the most are the 20-day and 50-day MAs. The 20-day MA shows the price trend
in the short term, and the 50-day MA shows the overall bias in the intermediate
term. Even more important is the 200-day MA, which shows the long-term bias of
the position.

As mentioned earlier, the longer the time frame of the chart interval, the more
bearing and weight the pattern will have on your analysis of the direction of the mar-
ket. The same is true of MAs. A 50-day MA matters more than a 20-day MA, while a
200-day MA is more important than a 50-day. Many institutions use program trading
to automatically begin buying when stocks or ETFs retrace to a 50-day MA. This is
even more the case with the 200-day MA, because this is considered to be a gauge of
the overall ETF’s long-term health.
It’s an amazing concept, but the 200-day MA simply acts like a brick wall when-
ever a stock, ETF, or index runs into it. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a test of support
from above or a rally into resistance from below. Either way, a position will rarely
move through the 200-day MA on the initial test. Unless the dominant trend is really
strong, it generally requires multiple tests of the 200-day MA before a position bursts
through. This is not only with the 200-day MAs on the daily charts, but on the intra-
day and long-term weekly charts as well. Figure 6.7, a daily chart from mid-2007 of
the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), is a great example of the power of the 200-day MA.
The shorter-term 20- and 50-day MAs have been removed so that you can more easily
see the 200-day MA.
Isn’t it uncanny how the 200-day MA acted perfectly like a brick wall on every rally
attempt in IWM until the ETF fi nally popped above it in mid-September?
After IWM broke out above the 200-day MA, the prior resistance of the 200-day
MA became the new support level. The most basic tenet of technical analysis is that
a prior area of resistance will become the new support after the resistance is broken.
Figure 6.7 is a great example of this. At the letter A, you see that the 200-day MA
became the new support.

Even on the long-term weekly time frame, the 200-period (200-week in this
case) MA works with reliability. If you look at the chart of the Semiconductor Index
($SOX) in Figure 6.8, you’ll see that the 200-week MA fi rst acted as major resistance,
and then became support.
From the beginning of 2004 through March 2005, the $SOX tried, but failed fi ve
times, to break out above resistance of its 200-week MA. It fi nally broke out above it
in July 2005, at which point the prior resistance again became the new support.
On August 3, 2007, I entered a new short position in the S&P MidCap 400
when the index fell below its 200-day MA. Rather than selling short the S&P MidCap
SPDR (MDY), I bought the inversely correlated UltraShort MidCap400 ProShares
(MZZ). Like all the other ETFs in the ProShares UltraShort family, MZZ is designed
both to move in the opposite direction of the S&P MidCap 400 Index and to move
at a 2 to 1 ratio. As such, MZZ rallied 5.8 percent that day, while the S&P MidCap
400 index dropped 2.9 percent. The daily chart in Figure 6.9 illustrates how MZZ
broke out above its 200-day MA (just as the underlying index fell below its 200-day
MA): Notice the high volume that began to kick in (A), just as MZZ began breaking
out sharply higher. Once again, this is a confi rmation of the higher volume that you
should always look for.
On the afternoon of August 6, 2007, I began to notice several factors around
midday that caused me to believe I was in the midst of a bullish reversal day. The
fi nancial sector, which had been leading the market lower, suddenly began showing
relative strength. Many other sectors did as well. When I observed that the S&P 500
and Nasdaq Composite were both on pace to register accumulation days, I decided
to play the bullish momentum through buying the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index

Tracking Stock Fund (ONEQ). Specifi cally, I liked how the Nasdaq Composite per-
fectly bounced off support of its 200-day MA the day before, undoubtedly a factor in
the upside reversal. See Figure 6.10.
On August 6, 2007, I bought ONEQ just before 2:00 p.m. Eastern time (ET), as
it pulled back from its midday high. It zoomed higher in the fi nal two hours, enabling
me to fi nish the day with a marked-to-market gain of just over 1 point. Two days later,
ONEQ had surged nearly 5 percent, into resistance of its 50-day MA. I sold into
strength at that point, locking in a solid gain on a quick, low-risk momentum play.
I could write an entire book of examples showing how the 200-day MA acts like
a brick wall for both support and resistance, but suffi ce it to say that the 200-day MA
is powerful. I strongly suggest monitoring the 200-period MAs on all your chart time
frames; you’ll see the same things I’ve illustrated here.
Typical Inverse Sector Relationships
As you begin to study the patterns of institutional money fl ow from one industry
sector to another, you will learn there are certain inverse correlations that commonly
occur between the industries.
If institutions are putting their money into any particular sector, as determined
by relative strength and volume, it means that money must be coming out of another
industry. By determining which sectors are showing relative weakness at the same time
as others are showing relative strength, you will begin to master the concepts of money
fl ow and sector trading.

In a broad sense, strength in technology-related sectors usually translates to weak-
ness or fl at conditions in the more “defensive” sectors such as utilities (and vice versa).
The sectors that are inversely correlated sometimes change as general market condi-
tions and geopolitical factors affect them. Nonetheless, Table 6.1 lists a few common
inverse relationships you will generally notice most of the time.
The actual relationships tend to change over time, but this table gives examples
of what to look for. When you understand these inverse relationships, you can fi nd
double the trading opportunities, as you will be able to simultaneously buy the sectors
with relative strength and/or sell short those with relative weakness.
Ten-Day Moving Average in Strong Trends
Although it’s not used as the basis for longer-term trades, the 10-day MA often acts as
a minor level of price support in strong trends. One of the most profi table short-term
trading techniques for buying ETFs in a strong uptrend is to wait for an opening price

at the 10-day MA and then buy the test of it. A test occurs when the price of an ETF
trades to the area of, and usually through, the actual MA. If the price holds, the “test”
is successful.
If you study numerous ETF charts, you will notice that the 10-day MA often con-
verges at roughly the same price as the hourly uptrend lines. The 10-day MA therefore
provides a shortcut for determining a relatively low-risk entry on the pullback of a
steadily uptrending ETF. The strongest ETFs in the market typically pull back to their
10-day MAs and then power ahead to new highs. The pullbacks come not only in the
form of intraday retracements, but on weak opening prices at or below the 10-day MA
as well.
When international ETFs showed incredible relative strength in the third quarter
of 2007, many of them only retraced to their 10-day MAs before resuming their steady
uptrends. Figure 6.11 and Figure 6.12 are just two examples of how gaps down to the
10-day MA in the fall of 2007 could be bought with confi dence in strong sectors such
as the international ETFs. Again, gaps occur whenever the opening price signifi cantly
differs from the previous day’s closing price. Figure 6.11 is a daily chart of the iShares
FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Fund (FXI), while Figure 6.12 is a daily chart of the Barclays

MA in these charts, and the two thin lines are the 20- and 50-day MAs. The tests of the
10-day MA are circled on the charts.
Although the 10-day MA has a high degree of accuracy in helping to predict
the resumption of uptrends, be aware that entries on the pullback to the 10-day MA
should also have a tight stop. Specifi cally, if an ETF gaps down to the 10-day MA on
the open, but fails to close the session above it, you usually want to scratch the trade

because the likelihood of a further correction down to the 20-day MA is high. In
strong trends, the 10-day and 20-day MAs can sometimes be far apart, so this would
keep your risk down.
Fibonacci Retracements
In addition to trendlines, support/resistance levels, and MAs, one of the greatest
analysis techniques is using Fibonacci retracements to predict support and resistance
levels in trending ETFs. By measuring the percentage that an ETF has pulled back, or
“retraced,” from its recent high, you measure the depth of the retracement. Fibonacci
retracements are a way of quantifying those retracements to fi nd predicted levels of
support (or resistance in downtrends).
Leonardo da Pisa, or Leonard Fibonacci, was a 13th-century Italian mathemati-
cian who, among other things, brought the Western world the Arabic decimal system
and an explanation of the mathematics contained within the Great Pyramids of Giza.
He also discovered the Fibonacci Summation Series, which can be used to predict
price movements in the markets.
To derive the Fibonacci Summation Series, take any two numbers and add them
together to get a third number. Then add the third number in the sequence to the
number before it to get the fourth number in the sequence, and continue in the same
manner. For example:
0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 1 = 3, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 3 = 8, 8 + 5 + 13

Supplementing the Basics 83
Therefore, the basic sequence looks like this:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233
To mathematicians, this additive series is based on this equation:
l 2 (cid:3) l (cid:4) 1
What is absolutely fascinating about this sequence is that if you take any num-
ber in the sequence and divide it by the number after it (after the eighth number in
the sequences), you always get the ratio 0.618. Along the way to deriving the ratio
0.618, you get a sequence of numbers the ratios of which oscillate around 0.618 (the
fi rst ratio is just a bit lower than 0.618, and the next ratio in the sequence is just a
bit higher than 0.618). This oscillation around 0.618 is mathematically important
to understanding the wavelike oscillations found in the expansions and contractions
of the markets. Further, if you take any number in the sequence (after the eighth
sequence) and divide it by the number before it in the sequence, the resulting ratio
is 1.618. The number 1.618 is known in geometry as the “Golden Ratio” and is
denoted by the Greek letter phi. To avoid getting too complicated, suffi ce it to say that
the Golden Ratio is an important number in geometry and from it can be derived the
Golden Rectangle and the Golden Spiral, which further relate to geometric character-
istics of stock charts. Let’s look at how Fibonacci ratios relate to analysis in the stock
markets.

84 ETF Selection through Technical Analysis
Figure 6.13 is a daily chart of the Dow Diamonds (DIA) that perfectly illustrates
how deadly accurate the Fibonacci retracements can be when applied to predicted
price movements.
In Figure 6.13, the Fibonacci retracement levels were measured from the signifi -
cant high of DIA in March, down to its major low in July. (The software does the rest
by automatically plotting the retracement levels.)
Notice how the rally attempts failed twice (A, B) upon running into the 0.382 level
(38.2 percent retracement), and then also foundered after bumping into the 0.50
level (C). In general, I have found the 50 percent level to be important because it often
is the point at which a stock or ETF reverses and resumes the direction of its prior
trend. That’s exactly what happened in this case, as DIA subsequently rolled over, tested
its 38.2 percent retracement once more (D), and then fell back down to the July low.
If you went long DIA somewhere after the July low was formed, you could have
used the 0.382 and 0.50 retracement levels as targets to take profi ts on your long posi-
tion. You can also use retracement levels for setting stop-losses. Like all the indicators
in the top-down strategy, the best part is that Fibonacci retracements work well on
any time frame.
The best way to draw the Fibonacci retracement lines is either from the high of
the most recent signifi cant rally to the signifi cant low of the last sell-off or from the
low of the sell-off to the high of the rally. The direction you draw the lines depends on
whether the index is in an uptrend or a downtrend. After the lines are drawn, 0.382,
0.50, and 0.618 are your primary retracement levels. Secondary, less signifi cant, levels
are at 0.236 and 0.764.
In strong trends, ETFs may only retrace to the 0.236 level before resuming their
primary trends. However, you are more likely to see retracements to the 0.382 and
0.50 levels. The 0.618 level is considered to be the “last line of defense” before a trend
reverses, so you can use it to assist in setting stops. Most of the time, a retracement
beyond the 0.618 level, on any time frame, leads to a rapid reversal all the way to the
100 percent retracement and beyond.
Bear in mind that the longer the time frame, the more accurate the Fibonacci retrace-
ments are. In addition, you can use multiple time frames to look for Fibonacci conver-
gence with MAs, which is even more powerful. Anytime that a price level coincides with
more than one specifi c level of support or resistance, a convergence occurs that is all the
more diffi cult for the price to move beyond. Therefore, if a moving average happens to
coincide with a key Fibonacci retracement level, it will be more diffi cult than otherwise
for the ETF to move beyond the price level at the convergence of the two indicators.
The most important elements of the top-down strategy for trading ETFs are iden-
tifying the overall market trend, determining the sector indexes with the most relative
strength (or weakness) compared to the broad market, and then fi nding the specifi c ETFs
with the best strength relative to the associated indexes. The additional tips in this chapter
supplement the basic strategy and can increase your overall percentage of profi tability.

CHAPTER 7
Strategies for Entry
The next step in selecting the best exchange-traded fund (ETF) is to identify the entry
and exit prices that will provide the highest profi t potential with the least risk (reward/
risk ratio). Unfortunately, technical trading is not, and can never be, completely black
and white. Market dynamics are such that gray areas are constantly being created,
which makes it necessary for you sometimes to use a bit of educated discretion.
Nevertheless, there are fundamental, tried-and-true strategies for pinpointing
ideal entry and exit prices based on the chart patterns presented. In keeping with my
philosophy of simplicity, the most profi table and effi cient entries and exits are based
primarily on trendlines, support, and resistance.
Breakouts and Pullbacks
When you trade ETFs, you can choose from two primary types of entries, depend-
ing on the chart pattern of the actual trade setup. The fi rst type is called a “breakout
entry,” meaning you are buying a rally above some key area of price resistance. The
second is called a “pullback entry,” which you buy when a steadily trending ETF
retraces to an area of major support. This chapter will examine both, as well as the
pros and cons of each.
General Breakouts
Many technical traders say a stock or ETF is “breaking out” only when it moves to a
new high. For the purposes of this discussion, however, a “breakout” simply indicates
the position has surged above a signifi cant area of price resistance. The breakout could
occur above consolidation (typically at a new high) or above a downtrend line.
For short positions, the term that applies is “breakdown entry,” which is simply
the opposite of a breakout. Breakdowns occur when an ETF falls below an area of price
consolidation (support), or when it breaks down below an uptrend line. Chapter 8
gives examples of both breakout and breakdown entries, but this discussion is focused
primarily on long entries. The same concepts apply on the short side, except every-
thing is the opposite.

88 Timing Your Entries and Exits
Breakouts to New Highs
Of the various breakout entries, breakouts to 52-week or multiyear highs typically
yield the greatest amount of profi t potential. If you ponder the mind-set of the typical
retail investor, it makes sense why this is the case.
When the average investor is faced with a position that moves lower after his
entry, he falls into “hope” mode. Rather than taking the route of a professional trader
and simply cutting the loss when things start to look bad, he nervously hopes that his
position just “comes back to breakeven” so he can sell with no damage done. Not only
is this way of thinking quite destructive to his bottom line, but this exact thought pro-
cess also is what creates horizontal price resistance levels in the market.
If an ETF hovers around the $80 level for several weeks and then suddenly falls to
$72, all the investors who bought at the $80 area now shift into hope mode, waiting for
the ETF to return to near their entry price. When it does (if it does), they immediately
launch their sell orders in order to scratch the trade. This “overhead supply,” created
by an abundance of people attempting to sell at the same time, produces areas of price
resistance that must be absorbed before a stock or ETF can move higher. Only when
the actual demand of people buying the ETF exceeds the overhead supply can the
ETF eventually move above the specifi c level of price resistance. Although an ETF is
synthetic, the underlying components tend to move in lockstep, with investors manag-
ing the individual stocks the same way. This causes ETFs to act very much like stocks.
When a stock or ETF is trading at a new high, it typically goes much higher than
the average investor would expect it to before pulling back and catching its breath.
This is simply due to the complete lack of overhead supply. If the position is at new
highs, there are no investors trapped at higher prices who immediately sell into the
strength of the fi rst rally. The weekly chart in Figure 7.1 typifi es the price action of an
ETF breaking out to a new high.
Figure 7.1 is a weekly chart of the Oil Services HOLDR (OIH), one of the big-
gest-gaining ETFs of the past several years. Notice how OIH was relatively stagnant
when stuck in its sideways trading range from 2002 through the middle of 2004.
Whereas, after it broke out to a new high in September 2004 (A), it began a multiyear
uptrend that continued steadily higher until the ETF fi nally saw a signifi cant cor-
rection and fell below support of its 40-week moving average (nearly the same as the
200-day moving average, or MA) in mid-2006. If you were using technical analysis for
long-term investments in ETFs, the break of the 40-week MA (B) would have been
the fi rst clear sign that the uptrend might be ending.
In the example of Figure 7.1, you would be twiddling your thumbs and tying up
precious capital if you were positioned in OIH from mid-2002 through mid-2004.
But if you bought OIH after it broke out to a new high in August 2004 and then
held until the break of the 40-week MA in July 2006, you’d be looking at a gain of
approximately 86 percent. That’s quite a nice return on investment for a two-year hold
time. Although this example shows a long-term investment charted weekly, breakouts
to new highs can just as easily be traded in the short term, using daily charts. You
should place entries at least 10 to 15 cents above the high of the bullish consolidation.

Placing a buy order only a few pennies above the actual prior high will often result in
premature trade entries due to “stop hunts.” These occur when market makers and
specialists use their massive buying power to push the price of the ETF just a few pen-
nies above an actual high or below an actual low in order to scoop up shares at the best
price before the ETF is about to reverse.
Novice traders and investors tend to avoid ETFs at new highs because they have
been conditioned over the years to “buy low, sell high.” But the reality is quite differ-
ent. ETFs at new highs tend to motor much higher because it doesn’t require a lot of
demand to push equities higher when the overhead supply is so minimal.
Although ETFs at new highs yield a lot of profi t potential when they follow
through, which is a majority of the time, the downside is that they can also reverse
quickly if the breakout to a new high fails. This occurs when an ETF briefl y moves, or
“probes,” above the prior high, maybe even closes above it for a day or two, but comes
back down just as quickly. When this happens, it’s important to have a fi rm plan for
quickly exiting the position.
When a breakout fails, the downward reversal (or upward reversal if shorting a
breakdown to a new low) can be fast and furious. This is because all the professional
traders who quite properly bought the new high suddenly fi nd themselves trapped.
Their astute nature mandates they immediately cut the loss and wait for another
breakout attempt. This, of course, creates a wave of downward momentum. In turn,
that downward momentum grows as short sellers who noticed the failure join in the
selling party. You don’t want to fi nd yourself trapped in such a mess, so be sure to keep
fi rm rules in place for exiting failed breakouts. I’ll discuss what those are later.

==================================================

90 Timing Your Entries and Exits
Breakouts above Downtrend Lines
The profi t potential for buying a breakout above an established downtrend line is
typically less than it is for buying a breakout to a new high. As previously explained,
this is because the position must still contend with overhead supply left behind in the
wake of investors who bought at higher prices. Nevertheless, the benefi t of this type of
entry is that the reward/risk ratio is often much greater.
On a new long entry above resistance of a downtrend line, the risk is minimal,
especially if higher volume confi rms the reversal of fortune. This is because resistance
of the clearly defi ned trendline should become the new support level after the resis-
tance is broken. The most basic tenet of technical analysis states that a prior area of
resistance becomes the new level of support after the resistance is broken. Because
of this, you can place a protective stop just below new support of the prior downtrend
line. If the reversal above the downtrend line holds, the downside risk is minimal com-
pared to the profi t potential of a rally back to the prior high from which the current
downtrend began. Often, reward/risk ratios can exceed three or four to one. Anything
over two to one is better than average.
With breakouts to new highs, you want to buy the position immediately after it
moves at least 10 to 20 cents above the prior high (depending on the volatility of the
ETF). With breakouts above downtrend lines, however, your entries should be inten-
tionally slower, as you look for confi rmation the trend reversal will hold.
Rather than blindly buying the fi rst break of the downtrend line, wait for the fi rst
minor retracement that follows. The idea is to make sure that the pullback does not
breach new support of the prior downtrend line. If it does, the reversal attempt was
likely a “fakeout” to reel in the bulls. Conversely, a minor pullback that holds above
the prior downtrend line provides a low-risk entry point with a high probability of
moving upward. After the fi rst dip that follows the break of the downtrend, you want
to buy as soon as the ETF trades above the prior day’s high. An example of this is illus-
trated in Figure 7.2.
Figure 7.2 shows the breakout of the downtrend line in the StreetTRACKS Gold
Trust (GLD). You see the fi rst test of support after the downtrend line is broken (A)
and the ideal entry point (B), after GLD subsequently moves above the previous day’s
high. Notice how that low held as support, enabling GLD to cruise higher in the
weeks that followed.
Pullbacks
For long positions, a pullback entry is based on the concept of fi nding an ETF with a
clearly established trend, and then waiting for the fi rst retracement (pullback) down to
support of either its primary uptrend line or MAs. For short positions, it’s the opposite
scenario, as in selling short a steadily downtrending ETF when it rallies into resistance
of its downtrend line or moving MAs.
With pullback trading, it’s critical to ensure that a clearly defi ned trend is already in
place. Otherwise, you risk entering the trade in no-man’s-land by getting in too early.

A clearly defi ned trend means you are looking for at least two higher highs and two
higher lows for longs (two lower highs and two lower lows for shorts). Starting from the
ultimate lowest price since the start of the new trend, the higher lows are formed when
each pullback reverses back up after forming a higher price than the previous low. The
same is true of a higher high. This trend will also form at least three individual anchor
points connecting the highs and lows. The time frame of these highs and lows depends
on the time frame of your trades. If you are swing trading, use the daily charts as the
basis for your decisions. For longer-term trades, the weekly charts provide the same
technical information.
A key point here is to remember a basic rule of trend trading: The longer a trend
has been intact, the more likely the established trend will continue in the same direc-
tion. If an ETF has been steadily trending higher for six months, forming successively
higher highs and higher lows, odds are much greater that it will continue higher as
compared to an ETF that has only been trending higher for one month. This is largely
the result of trendline support becoming a self-fulfi lling prophecy. When professional
traders see support of a trendline, they place their buy orders in anticipation of a
resumption of that trendline. The very act of their doing so is largely what causes
trendlines to work as a method of low-risk trade entry. It’s essentially a self-fulfi lling
prophecy.
Here again, you must sometimes fi ght the urge to let human nature dictate its
logic. When I was a new trader, I constantly avoided long-established trends, thinking
I was too “late to the party” for a low-risk entry. In the beginning of learning techni-
cal analysis, it’s normal to think this, but it’s faulty thinking. Remember that steady

92 Timing Your Entries and Exits
trends are formed through institutional buying of individual sectors. When the “big
boys” start buying stocks within a particular industry, they typically continue throw-
ing their money in that area until the next promising idea comes along. You only need
to look at recent charts of the oil and utilities sectors to see that institutional money
fl ow can often continue for years. Of course, there is always the risk that your pullback
entry may also coincide with the end of the trend, but this pullback method of entry
helps to minimize that risk.
Though it may be tempting to do so, avoid new trade entries on their fi rst test
of price or trendline support. Rather, stalk the setup like a sniper, waiting for the fi rst
sign of confi rmation that the currently established trend is ready to resume. Doing so
decreases your risk of stopping out immediately after your entry.
To look for confi rmation on pullback entries, you simply drill down to the next
lowest time frame, and then look for a breakout above resistance. If, for example, you
are looking to buy a pullback to trendline support on the daily chart interval, you would
subsequently wait for the newly formed hourly downtrend line to break. When it does,
you then enter the position in anticipation of a ride back to the prior highs and onward.
If the pullback comes but never moves back above resistance of the shorter time frame,
you simply don’t enter the trade.
Basic trendlines work great for pullback entries, but the 20-day MA is another
useful indicator, as buyers tend to step in immediately upon the test of the 20-day MA
support with strongly trending ETFs. Note that the best trending ETFs can go many
months without ever retracing down to their 50-day MAs. If the 20-day MA hap-
pens to converge with support of the trendline, that’s even better. An entry with the
pullback to the 20-day MA, followed by confi rmation of the trendline resumption, is
illustrated in Figure 7.3, a daily chart of Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB).
In Figure 7.3, the initial entry point came at point A, which was the fi rst pullback
to the 20-day MA after the breakout above the high of the consolidation (C). Brief
probes below support are common after breakouts, but it’s key that the 20-day MA
caught the price of XLB. If the initial breakout or pullback entry had been missed, any
of the retracements to the 20-day MA (each one is circled) would have provided other
opportunities for long entry. After the trend became established and the 20-day MA
became support, all pullbacks to the 20-day MA could be bought until the price even-
tually broke the 20-day MA, as it did at point B. Intraday probes below the 20-day
MA are okay, but a fi rm close below the 20-day MA often precedes a steeper correction
down to the 50-day MA.
When doing pullback entries, the use of Fibonacci retracement levels is a great
tool for determining the likelihood of a resumption of the previous trend. If the posi-
tion deliberates after rallying to only the 38.2 percent or 50 percent retracement level
from the prior high down to the prior low, you may want to trail a stop higher to lock
in gains. On the other hand, a rapid rise to the 61.8 percent retracement level indi-
cates good odds of a subsequent rally to the prior high and beyond.
When waiting for confi rmation that the trend is resuming before buying, remem-
ber your goal is not to squeeze every potential dollar of profi t out of the trade. Rather,
your job is to take a big chunk out of the middle, with the least amount of risk.

Short-Term Corrections
When trends are strong and price retracements are minimal or very short-lived, it can
be tempting to just enter at any price, but waiting for at least a short-term market cor-
rection still provides you with the opportunity for profi ts, without the risk that comes
from being a “late-to-the-party Charlie” chasing the big moves that already occurred.
The fi rst thing you must remember is that market corrections always happen in one
of two ways: by price or by time.
A correction by price (a pullback or retracement) occurs when a stock or index
reverses against the direction of its primary trend until it hits some sort of resistance
or support level, depending on whether it’s in a downtrend or uptrend. In a steadily
downtrending market, retracements up to resistance of both the 20-period and
40-period MAs on the hourly charts often provide ideal entry points for new short
positions. A very weak ETF will often retrace only up to the 20-MA and then resume
the downtrend, while an ETF with a bit more strength might make it all the way up
to the slower 40-MA.
Figure 7.4 is a recent example of such a correction by price of the iShares Russell
2000 (IWM), which was sold short when it rallied into resistance of its 20-MA on
the hourly chart on May 16, 2006, and was covered for nearly a 4 percent gain three
days later.
Looking at the hourly chart in Figure 7.4, notice how the fi rst time IWM ran
into its 20-MA since the sell-off began was on May 16, the same day it was sold short.
Notice how, following that date, the 20-MA perfectly acted as resistance that ensured
a continuation of the downtrend. Each bounce into the 20-MA that you see circled in
Figure 7.4 is a clear example of a short-term correction by price.

When a stock or index is showing absolutely no signs of buying interest, it will
still correct from a large sell-off, but it will often have a correction by time instead.
This simply means that, rather than retracing a portion of the trend, it will trade side-
ways, near the bottom (or top) of the range. A good example of this can be found on
the daily chart of the Oil Services HOLDR (OIH) in Figure 7.5.

Notice how OIH came down to its 50-day MA (the circled area), but failed to
bounce off that support level. Instead, it “corrected by time” for two short days and
then broke down to new lows. When this occurs, you can enter a new short position
on a break out of the range. In this case, you could have shorted OIH when it fell
below the lows of both May 15 and 16. When the lows also converge with a pivotal
moving average such as the 50-day MA, it further increases the odds of a successful
trade. I didn’t short OIH when this occurred, but I did realize a substantial profi t from
a short position in the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which had a similar
chart pattern.
Having a basic understanding of the ways in which markets correct will prevent
you from being late to the party and selling short at the bottom of a sell-off or buying
at the top of a breakout. If the ETF has so much relative weakness that a correction by
time is the only correction you get, it is advisable to reduce your position size in order
to compensate for the slightly increased risk of not getting the most ideal entry point.
The same is true of buying ETFs that only correct by time in uptrending markets.
The Opening-Gap Rules
Due to large changes in overnight supply or demand, the major market indexes, indi-
vidual stocks, and ETFs often open much higher or lower than where they closed the
previous day, which is known as a “gap.” Buying long or selling short an ETF that
hits its trigger price due to an opening gap is sometimes riskier than entering an ETF
that trades through its trigger price in an orderly fashion. Likewise, open positions
sometimes gap open beyond their stop prices but immediately reverse in the right
direction. The following rules will help you manage positions that gap open beyond
their trigger or stop prices:
• ETFs that gap open beyond their trigger prices. For a long setup, buy the ETF
only if it subsequently sets a new high after the fi rst 20 minutes of trading. For a
short setup, sell short the ETF only if it subsequently sets a new low after the fi rst
20 minutes of trading. In both cases, the ETF must exceed its 20-minute high (for
longs) or 20-minute low (for shorts) by at least 10 cents before you enter the posi-
tion. Also, don’t follow the gap rules for any opening gap of less than 10 cents above
or below the trigger price.
• ETFs that gap open beyond their stop prices. If a long position gaps down to open
at or below its stop price, continue to hold the position for the fi rst 20 minutes of
trading, at which point the new stop price is adjusted to 10 cents below the low
of the fi rst 20 minutes. For short positions, adjust the stop to 10 cents above the
high of the fi rst twenty minutes.
The above rules are designed to keep you out of trouble by preventing you from
entering or closing a trade at the worst price of the day. Nevertheless, just like every
other rule in trading, there are always exceptions that enable experienced traders

96 Timing Your Entries and Exits
to occasionally deviate from these rules with high success rates. These are nuances
that cannot be taught, but can only be learned through experience. These rules are
designed to avert major losses, which is much more important than whether you leave
some profi t on the table or not.
Here are four ways the opening gap rules apply to trades, in more detail.
1. If an ETF hits its trigger price due to an opening gap, do not enter the position
until the ETF trades through the high of the fi rst 20 minutes (or the low of the
fi rst 20 minutes if you are looking to short). For example, let’s assume the plan is
to buy SMH if it trades above 24.55 today. Due to positive news that occurred
overnight, the broad market gaps up and SMH opens at 24.67, which is 12 cents
above the trigger price. After opening, the highest price that SMH trades within
the fi rst 20 minutes of trading is 24.79. This means that, despite the fact that the
trigger price was only 24.55, you do not enter the trade on the open, and you
enter this trade only if it trades above 24.79 after 20 minutes of trading.
Even though this sometimes results in paying a higher price for the trade,
the probability of the ETF going higher is statistically much greater because
stocks and ETFs that set new highs after their fi rst twenty minutes of trading
typically go much higher. If the ETF is unable to break above its 20-minute
high, however, the opening gap will often represent the highest price the stock
will trade that day, which is why you do not want to buy a gap up beyond its
trigger price unless it breaks the 20-minute high. This rule prevents losses time
and time again by preventing you from entering a high-risk trade. When enter-
ing a trade that has broken above its opening 20-minute high (or low), you
should tighten the initial stop-loss to a price that is usually equal to twenty cents
below the low of the morning (or the high of the morning if you are short). It is
important to raise the stop because you are entering the trade at a higher price
than initially anticipated.
2. On some occasions, a trade triggers on the open and fails to set a new high, but
consolidates by trading sideways near the intraday highs of the fi rst 20 minutes.
If other market internals such as volume, the advance/decline line, and the tick
are strong, you can sometimes enter a trade despite the fact it has not yet broken
the high of the fi rst 20 minutes. When doing so, the stop is typically set about
10 cents below the low of the day (gap up), which reduces the risk of entering.
Buying without a break of the 20-minute opening high or selling short without a
break of the 20-minute opening low is a riskier and more advanced type of trade
that beginning traders may wish to forgo.
3. If there is an opening gap of 2 percent or more in the direction of a trade held
overnight, you usually close half of the position immediately on the open to
lock in profi ts and easy money with at least a 2 percent gain. Otherwise, the gap
can quickly reverse going into the 9:50 a.m. reversal period, causing profi ts to
disappear. It is important to note that half of the position is kept open because it
often will realize even larger profi ts on the second half of the shares if the trend

==================================================

Strategies for Entry 97
continues in the direction of the gap later that morning. When keeping half of
the share size open after a large opening gap, you should typically tighten the stop
to just above or just below the high or low of the day (as explained above).
4. In the event that the market has a large gap (that is, more than 2 percent) in
the opposite direction of a trade you held overnight and causes your trade to be
stopped out due to an opening gap, you should consider handling the situation
as follows: If you are long, let the ETF trade for fi ve minutes before selling it and
taking the loss. After the fi rst 5 minutes of trading, mark the low price that was set
during the fi rst 5 minutes. If the trade subsequently trades below that 5-minute
low, immediately cut the loss on the whole position. If the trade never violates
the 5-minute low, however, hold the trade and watch for a bounce into the 9:50
a.m. reversal period, which you also mark so that you know what the 20-minute
high price is. If the trade now heads south, cut the loss by selling into the bounce
near the 20-minute high. But if the trade takes out the 20-minute high, you can
continue to trail a stop higher. The purpose of this rule is not to prevent taking a
loss (because you will usually still have a loss), but rather to minimize the loss by
waiting for a better opportunity to sell into a rally. If the rally never comes, get
out when the 5-minute low is violated. Statistically, it is worth the risk to wait out
the fi rst 5 minutes because stocks will usually have at least an initial bounce if they
get whacked on the open. The inverse of this rule applies if you are short.
Breakout or Pullback Entry?
By now, you may be asking yourself, which type of entry is better, a breakout or
pullback? The answer depends on two factors: overall broad market conditions and
personal comfort level.
Breakouts work better in certain types of markets, while pullback entries can
effectively be used in nearly any market environment. The most important thing to
realize when buying breakouts is that they have a much higher rate of success in bull
markets than in choppy, range-bound markets. Similarly, breakdown entries are more
successful in steadily downtrending or bear markets.
Approximately 80 percent of stocks follow the general pattern of the major
indexes. Therefore, it is not prudent to attempt breakdown short entries in raging bull
markets, nor is it wise to buy breakouts in weak markets. While doing so occasionally
works, why fi ght against the odds? Go with the overall trend and you’ve automatically
increased your chances for a profi table trade dramatically.
Choppy markets yield a low batting average for both breakouts and breakdowns,
as there is usually a tug-of-war going on between the bulls and bears. If you are buy-
ing breakouts and you fi nd yourself continually getting “chopped up,” or realizing
an overall large loss through a series of small losses, take an objective look at overall
market conditions. Chances are that you’re attempting to do so in the midst of an
indecisive, possibly quite erratic, broad market. Stick to steadily trending markets,

==================================================

98 Timing Your Entries and Exits
always trading in the direction of the overall trend, for the highest chance of success
when buying breakouts or short selling breakdowns.
Although you might be inclined to dismiss the idea of individual personality
being a relevant factor in trading, don’t underestimate its importance. If you’re the
type of person who is always thinking that an ETF at new highs is overbought or too
expensive, buying breakouts to new highs is probably not a good idea. You’ll either
fi nd yourself selling the position too early, missing most of the profi t potential, or sell-
ing the position at the fi rst hint of a potential short-term correction. Buying a trend
reversal or a break of a downtrend line may be better suited to your personality. There’s
nothing wrong with that, as both types of entries have distinct advantages. Be honest
with yourself and act on your instinct.

CHAPTER 8
Strategies for Exit
Given that an average of 30 to 40 percent of your overall trade entries will result in net
losses, it’s critical to know when to exit them. If you don’t have a proper understanding
of when to close positions, profi table trades will frequently turn to losing ones; you
will prematurely close winning trades without a valid reason and exit losing trades at
the worst possible times. This chapter presents strategies to help you manage trades
that are going the right way, as well as strategies for effi ciently exiting losing positions.
Strategies for Closing Winning Positions
When you fi nd yourself on the winning side of an exchange-traded fund trade, emo-
tions have a natural tendency to run high. Though the best professional traders keep
their emotions in check with both winning and losing positions, human psychol-
ogy causes emotions like fear and greed to creep in. Fear of losing unrealized profi ts
and greed for higher profi ts can be equally damaging. Having a sound set of objec-
tive strategies for managing winning trades is the best way to keep away from these
destructive emotions.
With all types of trade setups, your goal is constantly to take a large chunk of
profi ts out of the middle of the move, while leaving the “amateurs” to call absolute
tops and bottoms. Remembering this rule alone is an excellent way to get a head start
on properly exiting winning trades. Though you will occasionally get lucky and nail
an exit at the end of the trend, intentionally trying to do so will inevitably cause sub-
stantial profi ts to be given back.
The ideal time to close winning positions depends primarily on what type of tech-
nical setup caused the original trade entry. For any type of setup other than a breakout
to a new 52-week high, the general idea is to sell into the strength of a major area of
resistance before the ETF starts coming back down in price. Breakouts to new highs,
however, are completely devoid of technical price resistance. As such, I typically use
a trailing stop strategy on these positions: I continually move my protective stop-loss
price closer to the market price, preferring instead to allow the trade to hit its protec-
tive stop price when bullish momentum dries up (the opposite for short sales).

==================================================

100 Timing Your Entries and Exits
Identifying Resistance Levels to Sell into Strength
Any ETF that is not trading at a fresh 52-week high will have some type of technical
resistance. Prior highs are known as “horizontal price resistance” because a horizontal
line marks the highest level to which an ETF previously rallied before heading lower.
Do you remember from the previous chapter the “hope” traders that bought near the
highs, right before a sell-off? These are the people who create the areas of horizontal
price resistance. Other types of technical resistance you can use include trendlines,
moving averages (MAs), and Fibonacci retracement levels.
On all ETFs with any type of overhead resistance, price targets at which to sell
into strength are derived from various technical levels of resistance. Downward price
targets for short sales are conversely determined by locating major areas of support,
and then attempting to cover the positions into weakness. Before buying any ETF not
at a new high, simply scan the chart and note what you see.
Here are some questions to ask yourself: Are the 20-day and 50-day MAs overhead?
Is there resistance of a 50 percent or 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement? Do you see
any trendline resistance? What about prior highs that have formed horizontal price resis-
tance? Each of these indicators creates substantial areas of resistance that can cause a rally
attempt to run into a wall and reverse. The greater the number of overhead resistance
levels, the more diffi culty the ETF will have moving much higher. For this reason, it’s
important to look at a few time frames, such as the 60-minute, daily, and weekly charts.
When comparing the same ETF on various time frames, remember that one chart
may look bullish while another looks bearish. But the longer the chart interval, the
more bearing its pattern will ultimately have on the price. Therefore, you wouldn’t
really care about the resistance of a 2-day, 15-minute downtrend line if your projected
time horizon in the trade is several weeks. If you did a good job with trade selection,
the ETF should break out above that short-term downtrend line just a few days later.
The opposite scenario is when a signifi cant level of overhead resistance presents
itself on a time frame greater than your projected time horizon. If you’re trading short-
term momentum with an anticipated hold time of only two to fi ve days, you should
not be very concerned if the ETF happens to be nearing resistance of a downtrend line
on a longer time frame such as the weekly chart.
In addition to assessing resistance levels on various time frames, be on the lookout
for the convergence of several different resistance levels. Within the same chart inter-
val, you might notice that the 20-day MA, 50-day MA, and primary downtrend line
have all converged within several cents of one another. Obviously, the more resistance
levels that converge with one another, the more diffi cult it will be for the ETF to move
above the price at the convergence.
Just as longer interval chart patterns have more bearing on the price of an ETF
than shorter ones, the same is true with moving averages. A 20-day MA provides sig-
nifi cantly more support or resistance than a 10-day MA, while a 50-day MA is going
to be more diffi cult to break through than a 20-day MA.
When assessing horizontal resistance levels, pay attention to the length of the
consolidation that marked the prior high. Did the price rapidly spike to that level and

                     PAGE 107                     
==================================================

Strategies for Exit 101
trade there for just a few days before moving lower, or did the prior high coincide with
weeks and weeks of consolidation that failed to break out? More bulls are trapped in
the latter scenario than in the former. This will make it more diffi cult for the ETF to
move higher. Horizontal resistance levels that were formed through a lengthy period
of price consolidation are more diffi cult to rally above than those that were formed
through a short-lived spike. Be sure to always observe not only the actual price of the
prior high, but how “thick” the resistance is at the area of resistance. The thickness is
determined by the amount of overhead supply that likely remains from traders being
trapped at buying the ETF at a higher price than the current market price.
Exiting the Winning Position into Resistance of Its Price Target
After recording the types of overhead resistance the ETF will need to contend with
and the corresponding prices, you need to set the actual “target.” The reason I put the
word target in quotation marks is that a target is only intended to be an approximate
projected price extension, not an exact price you must see before selling the position.
Any price target is merely an educated guess as to where the ETF will at least pause,
based on the technical facts before you.
Viewing your target as an approximate price range to sell into, you wait for bull-
ish price action to provide you with the opportunity to take profi ts near the projected
target. This often comes in the form of an overnight gap that causes the ETF to open
much higher than the prior day’s close. When those gaps occur near your price targets,
you should view them as a gift and consider selling at market, on the open. If no bull-
ish gap arises as you near the major area of resistance (the target), you can then shift
to using support of the prior day’s low as your new protective stop. Each day, you may
want to wait for either the bullish opening gap or a breakdown below the prior day’s
low, whichever comes fi rst, as the level to sell your winning position. You can also use
trendlines on short-term 15-minute or 60-minute intraday charts to assist in fi ne-
tuning an exit when a position nears its price target.
Determining Exit Prices on Winning ETFs at New Highs
Aside from the virtually unlimited profi t possibilities from ETFs trading at their 52-week
highs, one of the best things about buying them is their complete lack of overhead sup-
ply. Since such resistance levels can be created only when prior highs exist, the absence of
prior highs translates to an absence of technical price resistance. The secret to maximiz-
ing profi tability on ETFs at new highs, without risking the possibility of giving back all
the profi ts, is the use of trailing stops. This is covered in detail in Chapter 9.
Strategies for Closing Losing Positions
Before diving into this subject, let’s start by assuming that you already have a fi rm
understanding of the seriousness of having protective stops on all new trade entries.
Entering a single stock or ETF trade without fi rst having a predetermined maximum



==================================================
                     PAGE 108                     
==================================================

102 Timing Your Entries and Exits
level of risk you are willing to accept is not something you should ever do. Because of
the paramount infl uence of risk management on the length of your trading or invest-
ing career, entire books have been written on the subject. Simply be sure to know the
maximum percentage of capital you are willing to risk on any one trade, and also be
sure that your share size is in line with your maximum dollar risk if the trade were
to hit its protective stop. A conservative rule of thumb for many investors is to risk
no more than 2 percent of your total account capital on any one trade. Before you
ever attempt to use the strategies taught in this book, I strongly advise you to do two
things: Use a protective stop on each and every trade, and be sure your maximum
amount of capital risk per trade is clearly defi ned before entering any trade.
Professional traders know that maintaining a consistently profi table performance
is not the result of winning on every trade. In fact, that’s far from the reality. Rather,
they realize that the business is simply a numbers game. They know that approximately
fi ve to seven trades out of every 10 are going to be winners, depending on their strat-
egy. What makes a trader net profi table over the long run is ensuring that the winning
trades are of a greater dollar amount than the losing trades. If they are, then a trader
who has just a 50 percent batting average will still be net profi table at the end of most
months and the year. As a rule, the lower the batting average (percentage of winning
trades), the greater the dollar amount the average winner to average loser ratio must
be. Because the business is purely a numbers game, there will obviously be quite a few
losing trades in the course of an average month.
Just as clearly defi ned exit strategies on winning positions help keep emotions
out of the decision-making process, so too do exit strategies on positions that have
gone against you. Having an objective methodology for cutting losses, and then hav-
ing the discipline to stick to it, prevents you from having a normal, predetermined
loss amount spiraling into a position that has damaging consequences to your trading
account.
For exiting winning positions, the strategy used depends primarily on the
original type of technical setup when the trade was entered. With closing losing
positions, however, the basic concept is the same, regardless of whether it was a
breakout to a new high, a breakout above a downtrend line, or a pullback to sup-
port entry.
Just as prior highs represent major areas of resistance, prior lows constitute key
levels of support. The same is true of MAs and trendlines that are below the current
price level. Convergence of multiple support levels provides more signifi cant support
than just one MA or prior low does. Essentially, the same methodology for determin-
ing price targets based on resistance levels can be used for setting stops below support
levels. Everything is just reversed. Above all else, the number one rule is to promptly
close the position when it hits your predetermined stop price. Nevertheless, there are
a few subtly nuanced techniques you can use that can help to minimize losses when
your ETFs move in the wrong direction.
The fi rst way to signifi cantly reduce the average dollar amount of your losing
trades is to have a plan for failed breakouts. When breakouts above downtrend lines or
to new highs follow through as intended, they typically yield a large amount of profi t

==================================================

Strategies for Exit 103
in a rather short period. The downside, however, is that they reverse swiftly when they
don’t hold above their prior resistance levels.
Rarely do I intentionally make a round-trip trade on an intraday basis, but when
failed breakouts occur, having the ability to manage the trade intraday is wise. This
special rule applies when an ETF moves above its pivotal level of resistance at some
point during the regular session, but closes the day below it. On a daily candlestick
chart, you would see a wick or tail above the pivotal resistance level, but the body
would be below it.
If the afternoon rolls around and it looks as though your breakout entry is poised
to close below its pivotal resistance level, it’s crucial to exit the trade the same day,
rather than sticking around to see what happens the next day. Occasionally, the break-
out attempt can be just a little early and will follow through properly the next day.
But more often than not, an ETF that fails to close the day above its resistance marks a
short- to intermediate-term top in which specialists fi rst run a stop hunt before taking
the market lower in the coming days.
With all the other bulls who bought the breakout now trapped, you don’t want
to be left holding the bag. Instead, exit promptly when the ETF is positioned to close
more than a few cents below its breakout level. Note that this refers only to trades on
the same day as entry. If the ETF closes above the pivot but dips below it the next day,
you would still go with your original stop price below the next major level of support.
Figure 8.1 shows how vicious the reversals can be when breakouts fail.

==================================================

104 Timing Your Entries and Exits
At this point, you may be thinking, “That’s a great idea, but what if the ETF rips
the next day and I’m not in it?” No problem. Failed intraday breakouts that follow
through the next day can easily be reentered over the prior day’s high.
As a novice trader, I used to have an illogical mental block against reentering
stocks at a higher price than I sold just a day or two before. I used to think that per-
haps I was getting in at too high of a price, but the stock would then go on to rally
many points higher. Although it’s certainly true that paying up a dollar or two on the
entry price results in lower profi t than staying with the original entry, the benefi ts
are worth it. Would you rather net a 6-point gain out of a 10-point move, or net
0 points out of it? As long as the reward/risk ratio is not signifi cantly skewed by your
reentry price, you should by all means reenter. Further, ETFs that scared everyone out
the prior day are all the more likely to zoom higher when they resume their bullish
upward momentum the following day. This is due to some of the overhead supply
immediately being absorbed.
Making the Best of a Losing Position
Most of the time, predetermined stop-losses can be easily adhered to, as the ETF will
usually hit its stop under normal market conditions. Nevertheless, there are some-
times situations in which sudden news or geopolitical events cause rapid changes in
the direction of the market. (The afternoon of September 18, 2007, was one such
example.) I suggest a strategy for when this happens that you can use to exit the posi-
tion in a calm, controlled manner.
To refresh your memory, the stock market entered a correction and began to get
very jittery in July 2007 due to concerns over liquidity in the subprime mortgage
arena. By September 2007, traders were speculating on whether or not the Fed would
make an aggressive move to cut interest rates, in the hopes of at least temporarily
saving the stock market. On September 18, the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) met to discuss economic policy, with a widely anticipated announcement to
follow at 2:15 p.m. Eastern time.
Looking to the upcoming Fed meeting, I expected the subsequent market reac-
tion to be even wilder than usual, given the fact that both the S&P 500 and the Dow
had been stuck to their pivotal 50-day MAs for three days. When major news events
happen to coincide with major areas of support or resistance in the major indexes, the
resultant reaction is often quite volatile. This time was no exception.
Much of Wall Street predicted a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate,
but the FOMC surprised traders by announcing a half-point cut in both the federal
funds rate and the discount rate. The stock market’s reaction was immediate and swift,
causing both the S&P 500 and the Dow to rocket above their 50-day MAs.
Going into the Fed announcement, I was positioned short in both the S&P
500 and the Dow, through being long the inversely correlated UltraShort S&P500
ProShares (SDS) and UltraShort Dow30 ProShares (DXD). Rather than viewing it
as risky to hold positions through such a highly anticipated meeting, I thought the
reward/risk ratio looked good. My protective stops were equivalent to both the S&P

500 and the Dow moving above their 50-day MAs. Conversely, my potential profi t
if the primary downtrends resumed was much greater than the capital risk of getting
stopped out. I knew only that I needed to act fast if the positions moved against me.
As I often do, I canceled my mechanical stop orders on open positions minutes
before the Fed announcement. This did not mean I intended to ignore the stops.
Rather, I just wanted to avoid getting whipsawed from a violent knee-jerk reaction that
often goes nowhere. Literally seconds after the 2:15 p.m. rate cut announcement, both
the S&P 500 and the Dow catapulted higher with a ferocious tenacity. This, of course,
had the opposite effect on my SDS and DXD positions, both of which collapsed below
their stop prices in the blink of an eye. Nevertheless, I managed the positions in such a
way as to avoid panic selling when the surprise announcement hit the markets.
I’ve learned that, on the rare occasions when these sudden moves occur, imme-
diately hitting the panic button to sell usually results in much lower sell prices than
calmly waiting for the fi rst small bounce to sell into strength. The idea is not to wait
for a full reversal back to the prior prices, as that’s only wishful thinking, but simply
to wait for a normal intraday bounce.
When micromanaging an intraday exit on a position, I often use the 20-period
exponential moving average (EMA) on the 2-minute chart. In strong intraday trends,
bounces off that level often result in a resumption of the primary trend. In this case,
I waited for both SDS and DXD to approach their 20-day EMAs on the 2-minute
charts before closing the positions. This enabled me to get out near the top of the fi rst
bounce. That day’s 2-minute chart of SDS is shown in Figure 8.2.
Because the downtrend in SDS was so strong, it reversed lower before actually
touching its 20-day MA (circled in Figure 8.2). Nevertheless, I sold SDS when it

After SDS promptly fell off a cliff, I waited for a 53.80
bounce toward the 20-EMA on the 2-minute chart 53.60
before selling it. When SDS neared the 20-EMA and 53.40
formed the first down candle, I sold it at $52.89, near 53.20

formed the fi rst down candle, as it neared the 20-day EMA. This got me out within a
few cents of the top of the bounce and only about $0.30 below the original stop price.
The same applied to DXD. Often, waiting for such a bounce on a position that hits
your stop will enable you to get out at a better price than the original stop. The impor-
tant point, though, is not to fall into hope mode and get greedy during the bounce.
The objective is merely to make the best of a losing position. That being said, it’s also
imperative to have an absolute “mercy” level at which you will close the position no
matter what the circumstances.
Trailing Stops
Just as important as knowing when to cut your losses is ensuring the maximum profi t
potential on winning trades, particularly those that have broken out to new highs.
When I was a new trader around the turn of the millennium, one of the following
two scenarios often happened to me: I immediately sold as soon as I had a little profi t
on the table, or I had a large profi t on the table, did not close the position, and gave
it all back.
In both cases, I was not making any headway. In the fi rst scenario, I often missed
the bulk of the move. In the second scenario, I was kicking myself for not taking the
profi ts. It fi nally dawned on me that the only way to break the cycle was to fi gure out a
way to catch the bulk of a price move without risking giving back all the profi ts. That
is the whole goal of a trailing stop. Once I began using trailing stops, my profi tability
shot through the roof.
A trailing stop is a method of continually raising (if you are long) or lowering
(if you are short) your protective stop after the position is showing a profi t. Rather
than trying to pick a top for where to sell and take profi ts, you can use trailing stops so
that ETFs are only sold when the trailing stops are eventually hit. With trailing stops,
“getting stopped out” has a whole different meaning because it does not necessarily
mean the trade was a losing trade. On the contrary, getting stopped out because a
position hit your trailing stop usually means it was a profi table trade.
The benefi ts of using a trailing stop versus a fi xed stop that never changes are that
maximum profi ts are realized by not trying to guess when a rally (or sell-off) will end.
Of equal importance, by adjusting the trailing stop, profi ts are continually locked in,
preventing the possibility of giving back all the unrealized gains.
The two types of trailing stops are “manual trailing stops” and “automatic trailing
stops.”
With a manual trailing stop, you must continually change the price of the updated
stop each time it needs tightening, doing so as the price of the ETF rises. This requires
traders to cancel old stop orders and place new ones each time.
An automatic trailing stop is a feature that allows traders to specify an amount
that the software will automatically raise a stop as the price moves higher. For exam-
ple, for a 10-cent automatic trailing stop, the software would continuously raise the
stop price to be 10 cents below the current market price each time the price rises.

==================================================

Strategies for Exit 107
Automatic trailing stops can be either in the form of a percentage or an actual dollar
amount.
Most online brokers now offer this automated capability, which is handy for those
who are not able to follow the markets full time. Nevertheless, you may prefer man-
ual trailing stops if you are using the top-down strategy in this book, because my stop
prices are based on breaks of support or resistance, as well as trendlines. An automatic
stop only takes into account fi xed prices or percentages, not technical indicators.
When an ETF nears the upper end of its ascending trend channel, the odds are
good that it is due for a pullback. Obviously, it may not be a problem to sit through
a pullback in anticipation of a subsequent high. But when you’ve determined that it’s
soon time to lock in the gains, intraday charts and trailing stops are the way to go.
Figure 8.3 shows how you can use an intraday trailing stop on an ETF that is near-
ing the top of its range. In this example, I sold the position after it fell below support
of its hourly uptrend line. Regardless of which time frame you trade in, you can use
trailing stops with equal effectiveness. Day traders can use 5-minute intraday charts,
while long-term position traders might trail stops below the daily or weekly trendlines.
This is clearly a personal choice based on your comfort level. The best strategy is to use
a combination of time frames to look for the confl uence of support or resistance levels.
The longer the time interval, the more weight the support or resistance will provide.
When an ETF eventually falls below the support of its trendline (or rallies above
its downtrend line on a short position), it’s important to distinguish between a stop
hunt that does not follow through and a legitimate reversal of momentum. To help
differentiate, it is important to look for a volume spike that coincides with a large
down candle.

108 Timing Your Entries and Exits
In Figure 8.3, notice how the volume spiked while the price broke below the
uptrend line. This is a legitimate break of support, one that would trigger the trailing
stop-loss order. You would give the stop a little more leeway if the probe below the
trendline was minor and volume failed to pick up substantially.
Most of the time, using trailing stops takes the guesswork out of exiting ETF
positions at new highs. The main exception is when a steady uptrend is followed by a
parabolic, high-volume move. At new highs, this is a rather common occurrence that
usually marks at least a short-term high. Parabolic, high-volume moves, known as
“exhaustion gaps,” occur when all the late-to-the-party Charlies fi nally buy a position
they should have bought long ago. These people, who are constantly buying and sell-
ing at all the wrong times, create a useful indicator for those who are looking to sell
into strength. Figure 8.4 is an example of a parabolic move of an ETF, which should
be sold into strength before it begins to reverse.
Figure 8.4 is a daily chart of the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Fund
(IYR), from mid-2006 through mid-2007. Notice how in February 2007 (A) IYR was
trying to rally above resistance of the upper channel of its primary uptrend. When this
occurs, it is one of the most reliable indicators of an overbought condition. Although
overbought stocks and ETFs can remain that way and become even more overbought
in the weeks that follow, a rally such as IYR’s is one of the most reliable indicators
for predicting sharp reversals. When this occurs, you want to sell into the strength,
rather than use trailing stops. The idea is to get out of the position before the rest of
the crowd. When selling into the strength of a parabolic move, it is important to make
sure the volume is always spiking higher as well. If not, the ETF is likely to continue

is also surging higher, as it is at B, it provides the confi rmation needed to sell into
strength. Notice how quickly and sharply IYR corrected after failing to move above
the upper channel of its primary uptrend.
Trailing Stops and Short Positions
Here are a few examples showing how trailing stops work equally effectively with short
positions.
Figure 8.5 is a 60-minute intraday chart that shows a precision exit point on
a short sale in the Dow Diamonds (DIA). In this chart, the usual MAs have been
removed so that you can more easily see the trendline and the reversal of momentum
that follows. The proper exit point for a short-term-momentum trade on the short
side occurs when DIA breaks out above its primary downtrend line, and then holds
on the subsequent test of support (A). Figure 8.5 shows movements that are great
examples of indicators to look for on short-term short sales.
Assume you sold short DIA sometime on August 9, after it formed an exhaustive
top. From that point, you stayed short, waiting for the formation of a lower high. This
occurred on August 13 (B). The subsequent lower low occurred two days later (C).
At this point, you stayed short, but August 16 brought a warning sign that the short-
term downtrend may be ending. The biggest sign occurred with the high volume that
day. Notice how large the volume bars were. Further, the losses occurred in the form of
an opening gap down. Then prices recovered later in the day, closing at their intraday
highs, above the morning highs. This price action was bullish and would have formed

a bullish hammer candlestick on the daily chart. Not surprisingly, DIA gapped up
(opened higher than its previous day’s closing price) the following day, August 17.
Though traders sold into the strength of the opening gap, it’s important to note that
DIA held support of the prior downtrend line, which became the new support (A). At a
point like this, you would look to cover your short position. You shouldn’t guess the
exit or panic by covering right on the opening gap. Instead, wait for the fi rst pullback to
support, close the position, and lock in a solid profi t. As you can see, that pullback
marked the low. DIA went on to recover all the way back to its high.
Again, you are not trying to guess where you might fi nd the absolute bottom of
the short play. Rather, you keep trailing a stop lower until it fi nally gets hit and knocks
you out with a gain. By doing so, you capitalize on a majority of the moves without
risking giving back all the profi ts. Your goal is not to capture every penny of the move
but rather to catch the bulk of the move. In this case, a trailing stop did just that.
Here’s another example of applying trailing stops to short positions. Figure 8.6 is
a daily chart of the Oil Services HOLDR (OIH) that illustrates a simple way to trail
stops for intermediate-term trades. Assume a logical entry around the $72 area, based
on a failure of OIH to hold above the 20-day EMA after bouncing off the 50-day MA.
The initial stop would be placed just above the prior high from May 14, around the
$75 area.
Upon OIH breaking below its May low, the stop would be lowered to breakeven,
due to a formation of a lower low (A). After breaking down to another new low (B),
the stop would be trailed to just above the last high (C). Notice how the formation of
that last high also coincides with the resistance of the 20-day EMA. A stop just above

the 20-day EMA can often be used on a short position, because it frequently coincides
with trendlines and prior highs.
As OIH continues south and sets a new low (D), the stop is now trailed to just
above the prior high (E). This repeats itself when OIH falls to a new low at point F.
Again, the stop is trailed to just above the prior high at G.
After setting a new low at F, OIH fi nally bounces pretty sharply, but reverses
upon testing resistance of its 20-day EMA. The trailing stop above the prior high at G
would still keep you in the trade. Nevertheless, a major cautionary sign of a potential
reversal occurs when the double bottom forms. When it is being formed, you trail the
stop tighter in order to lock in more gains. The new stop becomes the prior high at
point H. On the next bounce up, the trailing stop is hit (circled at level H). Notice
that you never set stops exactly at the prior high or low. Instead, you always set the stop
about 15 to 20 cents above on an intraday chart, or a point above on a daily chart,
which prevents the stop from getting triggered before you want it to by the specialists
and market makers who are looking to grab shares at the best prices. Once the stop
was initially moved to breakeven, the risk was taken out of the trade, enabling you to
continue trailing the stop lower each time a new low was set. Looking at the chart,
you can see that every time OIH sets a new low, you wait to see how high it bounces,
and then you mark the high of that bounce and lower your stop to just above the high
of that bounce. This is known as a “swing high.” Based on this strategy, you would
have gotten stopped out around $55. That would have been a 17-point profi t if you
were patient enough. Remember, the goal is not to catch the bottom by covering at
the exact low. Rather, focus on catching a majority of the move with trailing stops. If
OIH had not dropped as much as it did, your trailing stop still would have locked in
gains to prevent giving them all back.
Tips for Trailing Stops
Note the following about trailing stops:
• The strategy of trailing stops works the same whether you are long or short. For
long positions, you can set stops just below areas of support. For shorts, the ideal
places to trail stops are above the areas of resistance.
• The strategy works the same within all time frames, suiting traders of all types.
• It is better to use mechanical, as opposed to mental, stops because they take the
emotion out of managing trades. By using trailing stops and setting actual mechani-
cal stops, you are essentially putting the trading process on autopilot: You set the
stop, wait for a new high or low to be made, adjust (trail) your stop, and forget
about it.

Trading ETFs: Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis, Second Edition
by Deron Wagner
Copyright © 2012 Deron Wagner
CHAPTER 9
Ten ETFs Bought Long
There’s no better way to reinforce the strategies presented here than with examples of
actual trades made using real capital.
The trade examples in this chapter are from the years 2005 to 2007 and are a
mix of winning and losing exchange-traded fund trades. I believe both have educa-
tional value. Although prices may vary over the years, the basic concepts of technical
analysis—and chart patterns that work—remain the same.
Breakout to a New High
One of the hottest ETFs in the stock market in 2006 and 2007, the iShares Xinhua
China 25 Fund (FXI) began its tremendous rally in 2005. Looking for short- to inter-
mediate-term trades with a hold time of two to three weeks, I caught a signifi cant
piece of the fi rst breakout that started the multiyear uptrend. See Table 9.1.
When a stock or ETF breaks out to a new 52-week high, upside momentum is
often fast and furious. This is simply because of the complete lack of overhead sup-
ply that would otherwise hold it down. This overhead supply—also known as “resis-
tance”—is created by traders and investors who previously bought the position at a
higher price and who subsequently attempt to sell into strength just to break even.
Curiously, many traders and investors shy away from buying new highs, but the reality
is that stocks and ETFs at new highs often turn out to be the most profi table positions.
If you are buying a breakout to a new 52-week high, the most desirable situation
is for the breakout to come from a base of consolidation. When an ETF shoots to a
new high without fi rst establishing a base, the breakout is often short-lived and subject
to failure. Conversely, previously established periods of consolidation are support that
act as springboards to catapult the position higher.
After tracking FXI for a period of several weeks, an opportunity to buy the break-
out to a new high came on July 14, 2005, which is when I bought it at a price of
$57.95. The date of the long entry on the breakout is circled in Figure 9.1.
Notice the shakeout that occurred on July 7 (A). That day, FXI gapped down
below its one-week base of consolidation, initially giving the impression that the
breakout was not going to happen. These types of moves are actually bullish because

they cause the “weak hands”—traders and investors who instantly sell at the fi rst hint
of trouble—to sell their positions, eliminating a bit of supply. Of particular impor-
tance in this example was the fact that FXI held support of its 20-day exponential
moving average (EMA). One week later, it had crawled back up to the high of its
consolidation, where it broke out shortly thereafter.
Prior to entering a trade, it’s important to fi rst have a clearly established plan, with
regard not only to your stop price, but to your target price as well. Though I often hold
longer-term winning positions for several months, some trades have a shorter time
horizon. With breakouts to new highs, I often use a target price of 10 percent, as ETFs
rarely go much higher than that without subsequently pulling back and correcting for
a period of weeks. Because I wasn’t interested in holding through the pullback, my plan
was to sell into strength when and if the 10 percent target was achieved. In this situa-
tion, the 10 percent target was realized just several weeks after entry. Figure 9.2 shows
the exit prices, when I scaled out of the position incrementally.
The most important price action happened on July 21. That day, FXI zoomed
3.4 percent higher and the volume was well above average levels. This confi rmed that

the breakout was for real. Nevertheless, several days later FXI began to move too far
away from support of its 20-day moving average (MA). Rather than taking the chance
of holding through an inevitable pullback, I sold half of the position into strength on
July 29, at a price of $61.65.
Surprisingly, FXI continued to move even higher in the days that followed, caus-
ing a parabolic short-term uptrend. Such parabolas often indicate overbought con-
ditions that can lead to a short-term top. Nevertheless, overbought positions can
remain that way for longer than one might expect. I decided to let the profi ts ride, but
switched to a trailing stop just below the previous day’s low. This meant that I would
stay in the position as long as the uptrend continued each day, as long as FXI didn’t
break support of the prior day’s low.
After another massive rally on August 2, FXI followed up with a sharp correction
the next day. I sold the remaining shares at the open of August 3, when FXI gapped
down to near the previous day’s low. The net result was an average gain on the share
price of approximately 8 percent on the full position. Not bad for a hold time of just
over two weeks.
Breakout of a Bullish Consolidation
Shorter-term “momentum trades” often present ideal opportunities for a quick, rela-
tively low-risk profi t. The trade in Table 9.2 that I held for just four trading sessions is
one such example, as OIH gained more than 9 points in that short period.

On September 18, 2007, the FOMC announced a surprise rate cut, which trig-
gered a monstrous intraday rally that followed the afternoon’s announcement. All
the main stock market indexes surged at least 2.5 percent, while top industry sectors
scored gains of 3 percent to 5 percent. With all the major sectors rallying so sharply,
you could have picked an ETF by throwing a dart that afternoon and still come out
in the plus column by day’s end. Nevertheless, some sector ETFs merely rallied into
big resistance levels from prior highs on their daily charts, while others broke out of
lengthy bases of bullish consolidation. I bought OIH that afternoon because its chart
was in the latter category (Figure 9.3). My long entry was about 20 cents above the
high of the consolidation marked by the horizontal line.
The fake-out inverted hammer candlestick that formed on September 17, the
day before the breakout, was particularly interesting. This bearish 1-day pattern, fol-
lowed by a dip below that low the morning of the entry, undoubtedly shook out the
weak hands. Often, such action is required before a stock or ETF will break out of a
base of consolidation, as it reduces the amount of overhead supply when the breakout

attempt comes. ETFs that fi rst have a shakeout within their consolidations are more
likely to sustain a breakout when they fi nally go. Figure 9.4 shows the subsequent
price action after the $185.79 entry, as well as the exit point.
Two days after my entry, OIH had cruised not only to a new 52-week high, but to
a historical high as well. Such breakouts often will continue trending higher for many
weeks or months due to the lack of overhead resistance levels. Nevertheless, I also
caution that ETF breakouts to new highs have a higher rate of failure when the main
stock market indexes are in sideways or range-bound primary trends. At the time,
the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow were all trading below their prior highs
after attempting to recover from a substantial correction the prior month. Therefore,
I deemed that overall market conditions were not conducive to aggressively holding
this breakout to a new high. Instead, I opted to just profi t from the momentum of the
initial surge, selling before the position had a chance to pull back.
To help determine an ideal exit point for this short-term trade, I marked the upper
and lower trend channels of the intermediate-term uptrend of OIH and planned to
sell OIH after it ran into resistance of its upper channel. It did so on September 21;
therefore, I sold on the following day’s open when OIH failed to gap above the previ-
ous day’s high. Closing the position on the open, I netted a quick gain of 5 percent
(9 points) since the September 18 breakout entry.
When a stock or ETF rallies into resistance of its uptrending channel, it does
not necessarily mean it will automatically pull back to the lower channel support.
Positions with relative strength will often ride the upper channel for days, or even
weeks. Nevertheless, my initial plan was just to trade momentum to a new high from

the September 18 breakout. At that point, the reward/risk ratio for further gains with-
out fi rst having a short-term correction was negative. As such, I decided I would be sell-
ing into the strength of the recent gains, rather than waiting around for a pullback.
OIH subsequently moved three points lower after my morning exit.
Continuation of a Long-Term Uptrend
Not only can multiple time frames be used for confi rmation of trends, but they can
also help you see setups that are not as apparent to traders who use only one time
frame. The purchase of StreetTRACKS Gold Trust (GLD) in June 2006 was one such
instance (Table 9.3).
From mid-May to mid-June 2006, GLD was correcting from a parabolic rally in
the preceding months. To the trader looking only at daily charts, GLD might have
appeared bearish and not in buying territory. However, I had my eye on the support
of the long-term weekly uptrend line, which had been in place for nearly a year. When
an ETF drops down to the support of an uptrend line that has been intact for such a
long time, it rarely falls through it on the initial test.
At a minimum, it will typically bounce and attempt to retrace at least half of its
loss from the prior high. Nevertheless, it’s not prudent to blindly buy the test of trend-
line support without fi rst waiting for some kind of signal that the uptrend is likely to
resume, or at least attempt to do so.
With GLD, I fi rst waited for a test of the weekly (long-term) uptrend line, and then
looked for a reversal above the daily (intermediate-term) downtrend line. Remember,
the longer the time frame of the chart, the more powerful it is. Therefore, I anticipated
that support of the weekly uptrend would override resistance of the daily downtrend
line, which is what occurred. The two charts below illustrate the setup. Figure 9.5
shows the bounce off weekly trendline support, while Figure 9.6 shows the day of entry
when GLD tested resistance of the daily downtrend line.
I bought GLD on June 21, 2006, when it popped above its downtrend line on
an intraday basis. Notice how GLD also moved back above its 10-day MA that day.
In Figure 9.6, the 10-day MA is the dashed line that converges with the primary
downtrend line, as it commonly does. Breaks above or below the 10-day MA are often
reliable indicators of a reversal of short-term momentum. This is especially true when
the 10-day MA converges with a clearly defi ned trendline. Nevertheless, because GLD

backed off a bit into the close, there was initially a question of whether or not the
entry was premature. I stayed with the position overnight, however, because GLD also
closed above the high of June 12. That day was signifi cant due to its large opening gap
down. When an ETF begins to move back above the high of a prior gap, the move is
bullish and usually leads to the gap eventually being fi lled.

At the time of entry, my protective stop was initially placed approximately one
point below the June 21 low. When buying breaks of downtrend lines, a stop below
that day’s low works well because the ETF should not violate that level if the reversal
is for real. Figure 9.7 shows the price action after the entry.
GLD never violated the June 21 low. It moved a bit lower for two days after the
entry, but notice how the prior downtrend line acted as the new support level. This is
a great example of how prior resistance becomes the new support, after the resistance
is broken. The test of the support of the prior downtrend line is marked A.
After attempting to shake everyone out, GLD began to move higher at a rapid
pace. Two weeks after the entry, GLD had retraced nearly half of its loss from the
mid-May to mid-June sell-off. Because its price action was quite bullish, I normally
would have continued to hold the position longer, but I fi gured that resistance of the
50-day MA might prove troublesome. As such, I sold into strength when GLD made
the initial test of its 50-day MA resistance on July 6 (B). This netted a respectable gain
of 6.8 percent (4 points) on a holding time of just over two weeks.
Breakout above an Intermediate-Term Downtrend
In early 2007, stocks related to the production of clean energy started to see major
accumulation by institutions. Specifi cally, solar energy stocks became extremely desir-
able, and several companies in that sector launched initial public offerings (IPOs).
This is a constant reminder that institutional money fl ow is always at work, fl owing

from one industry sector to another. Your job is merely to spot it, and then ride along
on the coattails of the big players.
I profi tably traded in and out of individual solar stocks, as well as a few of the
alternative energy ETFs, throughout the year. The trade of PowerShares WilderHill
Clean Energy Fund (PBW) shown in Table 9.4 is one such example in which I was
looking for a reentry point after a correction occurred on its daily chart. The oppor-
tunity came when PBW broke out above convergence of both its 50-day MA and
intermediate-term downtrend line.
During the week I began tracking PBW for a reentry, the leading solar energy
stocks, many of which make up the bulk of the PBW portfolio, appeared poised
to resume their strong weekly uptrends. When leading stocks within a sector begin to
show relative strength and strong price action, the corresponding ETFs will inevitably
follow. That’s why it’s a good idea to always follow the market leaders within each
industry, even if you trade only ETFs and not individual stocks. Figure 9.8 illustrates
the action on the day of entry.

When it fi rst corrected from its August high, PBW became quite volatile and
erratic. Nevertheless, the trading range tightened up considerably in the two weeks
prior to entry. Tight ranges during periods of consolidation increase the odds of a
breakout “sticking,” meaning the breakout holds above the prior level of resistance
instead of drifting right back down; so I was comfortable buying PBW when it
spiked above resistance on September 18. The breakout above its 50-day MA and
its primary downtrend line also looked good. The more levels of resistance that con-
verge in one point, the more powerful the breakout will be if it comes. Figure 9.9
shows the subsequent price action after entry, as well as the exit price just one week
later.
Though I intended to hold the PBW trade as the ETF rose to a new high, it
moved too rapidly up to an area of horizontal price resistance from July 2007. I there-
fore projected it would fi rst need to pull back or, at the least, consolidate for a while
before moving higher.
Because the September 24 high exactly matched resistance of the prior high, on
July 16 (A), I made the decision to sell into the strength of the rapid move. I sold PBW
for just fi ve cents below the September 24 high (B), netting a gain of 6.6 percent (1.42
points) on the 4-day hold.
Most trades in this chapter refl ect gains of a larger point value, but keep in mind
that the percentage a stock gains in price is more relevant than just the number of
points. If your position sizing was the same for every ETF you entered, then the actual
volatility in points would matter more. Nevertheless, you want to constantly adjust

your position size based on the price and volatility of each ETF, ensuring that a rela-
tively equal risk and profi t potential is assumed on each and every trade, regardless of
the ETF’s cost or volatility. Position sizing is covered in Chapter 11.
Continuation of a Long-Term Uptrend
The setup of the trade in Table 9.5 is similar to the earlier StreetTRACKS Gold Trust
setup. Again, I bought a breakout of the intermediate-term downtrend line after SMH
bounced off support of its long-term uptrend line. I then took profi ts by selling into a
key resistance level. There are, however, a few minor differences between the two trades.
GLD never violated support of its clearly defi ned weekly uptrend line. SMH, on
the other hand, dipped below support of its long-term trendline for several days before
snapping back above the trendline (Figure 9.10).
When I was a new trader, I mistakenly assumed that any violation of trendline
support invalidated the trade. But I soon learned that stocks and ETFs commonly
probe pivotal levels of support and resistance in a stop hunt. In the case of SMH,
notice how the tail of a single candlestick dipped below support of the uptrend line
for a single week in early January 2005 (A). The intermediate-term downtrend line,
above which I subsequently bought the breakout, is marked B.
Violations of trendline support are not necessarily bad. When an ETF moves mar-
ginally below a pivotal level of support for no more than a few days, and then promptly
zooms back above it, it has the effect of shaking out the weak hands. For stocks and
ETFs to move higher, demand must exceed supply. When the weak hands sell their
positions near the lows, more astute traders and investors scoop up those shares at what
is perceived as discounted levels. This has the corresponding effect of absorbing a large
amount of what would have been overhead supply. When the supply dries up, it makes
it much easier for an ETF to move higher and resume its prior, dominant trend.
Although these stop hunts are often bullish, it’s important to wait for confi rma-
tion that the trend will resume, rather than blindly buying every dip below support.
Failing to fi rst wait for confi rmation can also have the adverse effect of your buying an
ETF that is topping and reversing its trend in a real way. When this occurs, the trend
reversals tend to be very rapid, so waiting for the ETF to move back above the prior
trendline reduces the risk of getting stuck catching a falling knife.

After SMH probed below support of its weekly uptrend line, I waited to see if it
would move back above it. It did so after only a few days of trading below it. The next
order of business was therefore to patiently wait for a break of the intermediate-term
downtrend line on the daily chart, which occurred on February 4. Since that day’s
rally also pushed SMH back above its 50-day MA, I entered the position on February
7 (circled in Figure 9.11).

When I bought SMH on February 7, the protective stop was placed at $31.49,
below the new support of both the 20-day and 50-day MAs. Notice that the one risk
of the entry price was overhead resistance of the 200-day MA. Nevertheless, I viewed
the bounce off the weekly uptrend line, along with the break of the intermediate-
term downtrend line, as being more powerful than resistance of the 200-day MA.
The assessment was correct, as SMH burst through its 200-day MA the next day.
After SMH moved above it, prior resistance of the 200-day MA became the new
support. In Figure 9.12, C marks where the pullback to the 200-day MA enabled a
resumption of the bullish momentum. Also, notice how the 20-day MA (the gray
line) had risen up to cross above the 200-day MA (the thick black line), another bull-
ish indicator.
With the GLD setup previously explained, I quickly sold the position into strength
when it ran into resistance of its 50-day MA. I similarly sold SMH into strength when
it ran into a major resistance level, but this time it was a horizontal price resistance of a
prior high (A), rather than an MA. The daily chart in Figure 9.12 shows the exit price
on February 28 (B). Notice how the exit corresponded with a test of the prior high,
netting a gain of 7.2 percent.
As expected, the prior highs of December 2004 turned out to be a rather diffi cult
resistance level for SMH to overcome. After selling the position, SMH moved back
down, eventually retracing nearly all the way back down to the January 2005 lows.
It wasn’t until June 2005 that SMH garnered enough strength to move beyond its
February high.

Resumption of a Long-Term Uptrend
In August 2007, I began monitoring the iShares Nasdaq Biotech Fund (IBB) (see
Table 9.6) for a potential breakout above its four-month downtrend line, based on
a move down to support of its long-term weekly uptrend line. The weekly chart in
Figure 9.13 illustrates the “big picture” weekly chart setup going into the day of initial
entry on August 31.
The ascending line on the chart of Figure 9.13 marks the support of the long-term
primary uptrend that began approximately two and a half years earlier. Notice how the
uptrend line provided support both in July 2006 (A) and March 2007 (B). IBB shook
out the weak hands with a quick dip below support in July 2006, but it promptly
moved back above the trendline the following week. Coincidentally or not, the 200-
week MA had roughly been converging with the long-term uptrend line as well. One of
the key rules in trend trading is that you must always assume an established trend will
remain intact until the market proves otherwise. Therefore, I anticipated another move
higher after IBB tested its uptrend line again in August 2007 (C).
This was a trade setup in which I used the knowledge that a longer-term trend will
have more bearing on the direction of the price than a shorter-term trend. Commonly,
I buy ETFs that break out above their intermediate-term downtrend lines after they
have bounced off support of their longer-term weekly uptrend lines. In this case, the
plan was to take the strategy a step further by buying a breakout above the weekly
downtrend line after the ETF bounced off support of its monthly uptrend line (shown
on the weekly chart of Figure 9.13).
After I decided upon the general plan to buy the breakout above the downtrend
line from the May 2007 high down to the August 2007 low, the next step was to fi ne-
tune the entry. Because the range of a weekly bar can be quite substantial, I scaled down
to a shorter-term hourly chart to determine where the shorter-term resistance levels
would be found. Upon doing so, I noted an area of horizontal price resistance around
the $78.80 area. The trigger price for entry then was targeted as being a breakout above
that level, shown on the hourly chart of Figure 9.14.
The initial entry was made on August 31, when IBB popped above its horizontal
resistance of $78.80. To protect against a failed breakout, I waited for a bit of price
confi rmation before adding the remaining shares of the intended position four days

After entry, IBB came all the way back down to test new support of its prior

lines commonly fall back down to test new support of their prior downtrend lines,
which is why protective stops always need to be below the downtrend line that you
buy a break of.
At the time of entry, the original price target was a test of the 52-week high that was
set in April 2007; however, the level of price resistance (B) could put a damper on the
upward momentum. I therefore sold half the position into strength on September 13,
as IBB tested that level. Given that the position was still acting well, I trailed the stop
higher and held on to the remaining shares with the original price target. I sold the
remaining half position of IBB when it subsequently tested resistance of its 52-week high
on September 26 (C). Because I expected a period of consolidation to follow the test of the
52-week high, I sold into strength of that day’s move, just as it tested resistance of the April
high. This resulted in a net gain of just under 3 percent from the entry.
Failed Follow-Through of a Downtrend Reversal
One of the most important skills you need, to be a consistently profi table ETF trader,
is to be able to quickly determine when the position you entered is not going as
planned, then decisively take action to close it without shifting into hope mode. My
entry in iShares Silver Trust (SLV) on July 12, 2006, demonstrated the importance of
closing a losing trade quickly. See Table 9.7.
Buying the break of an intermediate-term downtrend line is often a very profi t-
able, momentum-driven trade setup. This is especially true when waiting for further
price confi rmation, rather than simply buying the fi rst break of the downtrend line.

Still, nothing is ever guaranteed in the business of trading, and the trade attempt of
SLV exemplifi es that. Figure 9.16 is a daily chart of SLV that shows the setup one day
prior to entry on July 12, 2006.
The big candle on June 29 (A) shows when SLV broke out above a six-week
downtrend line. Since I missed the initial breakout above this level, I waited for the
fi rst pullback to buy the subsequent breakout above the short-term consolidation.
After peaking on July 6, SLV made a steady correction down to support of its
20-day EMA on July 10 (B). The following day, it gapped up above the high of the
previous day, and closed near the high of July 6. This was quite bullish price action,
as it pointed to just a short-lived correction down to the 20-day EMA, followed by
immediate buying interest. The plan was therefore to buy the fi rst breakout above
the July 6 high, in anticipation of a resumption of the newly established uptrend.
The entry came on the following day, July 12, but the price action was less than con-
vincing. To more clearly see what happened on the day of entry, look at the intraday
hourly chart in Figure 9.17, which also shows the entries and exits from that day.

On July 12, SLV gapped open above the high of July 6 (A), triggering the long
entry into the position. Because of the opening gap, I waited for a breakout above the
high of the fi rst 20 minutes before buying it. Acting well in the morning, SLV subse-
quently rose above its 20-minute high about one hour after the open. I bought SLV
at $117.65 when it did so (B).
Despite solid price action in the morning and in the several days preceding entry,
that day’s price action rapidly deteriorated. Just after midday, SLV headed south in a
big way. With a bullish opening gap, the morning low of $116.47 should have pro-
vided price support, but it didn’t. Instead, SLV plummeted more than 3 points in less
than an hour.
Given the extremely negative price action on the same day as entry, there was no
point in holding the position. My timing was obviously off. I sold SLV at a price of
$114.34, when it broke below support of the previous day’s afternoon consolidation (C).
Though I lost more than 3 points in a matter of a few hours, selling was the right
thing to do. Taking action based on the facts the market presents is all you can do.
Clearly, there was no reason to hold on to a position that demonstrated such ugly price
action when everything leading up to the entry was bullish.
As it turns out, selling the same day was a wise decision. Just four days later, SLV
had fallen 10 more points below the sell price. If a trade is simply not acting right after
your carefully planned entry, don’t be afraid to cut it. If your initial assessment of
the situation was wrong, you can always reenter the trade. Regardless, it’s much bet-
ter than hoping and praying that your position will come back to your entry price.
Always trade what you see, not what you think.

Pullback to an Intermediate-Term Uptrend Line
In mid-July 2007, the major indexes began to correct from their 52-week highs in
unison. Assessing the relative strength and weakness of the main stock market indexes,
I noted that the small-cap iShares Russell 2000 Index was showing the most bearish
divergence to the downside. When the primary uptrend lines began breaking, I there-
fore decided to initiate a new short position in the Russell 2000 Index, but I waited
for a solid bounce into resistance before doing so.
The fi rst substantial broad market bounce off the lows didn’t come until three
weeks after stocks began selling off from their highs. Studying the Russell 2000 Index
chart, I observed that the ideal entry point would be a bounce into resistance of the
200-day MA that the index had fallen below two weeks prior.
My expectation held up, when a sharp three-day bounce that began on August 6
quickly took the Russell 2000 Index up to resistance of its 200-day MA. The 20-day
EMA had descended and crossed below the 200-day MA, creating additional resis-
tance. The bounce also coincided with a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement from the
July high, down to the August low. This multiple convergence of resistance levels cre-
ated a low-risk short entry in the Russell 2000 Index. This is shown in Figure 9.18, a
daily chart of the Russell 2000 Index.
Rather than selling short the popular iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), I bought the
Short Russell 2000 ProShares (RWM) (see Table 9.8), which is inversely correlated
to the direction of the underlying index. The main benefi t of buying RWM instead
of selling short IWM is that the position could be taken in a nonmarginable cash
account such as an IRA or a 401(k). Short positions, conversely, always require a mar-
ginable account. I bought RWM at $69.57, on August 8, as IWM tested resistance of
its 20-day EMA and approached its 200-day MA. The long entry in RWM is at A in
the daily chart of Figure 9.19.
Because RWM is inversely correlated to the Russell 2000, the chart is basically the
same as if you fl ipped the Russell 2000 chart upside down. Also, since RWM had been
trading fewer than 200 days, the charting software was not yet able to plot a 200-day
MA. That didn’t matter, though, as I simply used the chart of the Russell 2000 as the
basis for the corresponding entry and exit points in RWM.
I sold the RWM position into strength on August 16 (B), as it tested resistance of
its prior high from August 6. I locked in a gain of nearly 5 points in just over one week.

The exit from RWM correlated inversely with a test of the August 6 low in the Russell
2000. Though I could have held the position longer, waiting to see if the Russell 2000
broke down to a lower low, the odds of a double bottom were decent. The Russell
2000 fell more than 13 percent in just three weeks, so there was a good chance the
index would at least enter a period of consolidation near the lows before moving lower.

In hindsight, the decision to sell RWM into strength near its prior high was a good
one. The Russell 2000 immediately began trending higher and continued doing so
until forming a peak in October 2007.
Failed Follow-Through of a Downtrend Reversal
After a four-month primary downtrend from May to September 2005, Pharmaceutical
HOLDR (PPH) fi nally began to see enough buying interest to reverse its downward
momentum. On September 7, PPH broke out above resistance of both its 50-day and
200-day MAs, which had converged with one another (see Table 9.9). The break of
MA resistance also coincided with a breakout above a two-and-a-half-month down-
trend line.
Expecting the breakout meant PPH had the potential to rally back to its prior
highs, I began tracking PPH for a long entry on the fi rst pullback. An ideal entry came
when PPH pulled back to new support of its 200-day MA, having broken out above
it a few days before. Further, support of the 50-day MA and prior downtrend line just
below the 50-day MA provided for a low-risk entry point. The daily chart of PPH in
Figure 9.20 illustrates the entry on the pullback, at $72.78.
At the time of entry, I placed the protective stop at $71.20, more than one
point below support of the 200-day MA, 50-day MA, and prior downtrend line. If
the breakout of the multimonth downtrend line was to stick, such a confl uence of
support should have been suffi cient to prevent the price of PPH from dipping below
that price.
Despite the careful planning for a precision entry point, the trade simply did not
work. PPH continued pulling back further after the entry point, and eventually went
all the way back down to its prior low of August. Fortunately, the predetermined stop
limited the loss to just 1.58 points. The exit and subsequent price action in PPH are
shown in Figure 9.21.
No matter how good a trade setup looks or how confi dent you feel about the odds
for a profi table trade, realize that anything can happen in the stock market. That’s why
having a fi rm, predetermined stop-loss order is crucial in all situations. Despite the
loss, I would enter the trade at the same point again if given the chance. All you can
do is put the odds in your favor by using sound technical analysis techniques. Beyond
that, having a plan for properly managing the potential outcome of all trades is crucial.

Follow-Through of a Downtrend Reversal
After a lengthy downtrend that lasted throughout the fi rst eight months of 2006, the
S&P Homebuilders SPDR (XHB) (Table 9.10) began showing signs of support and
relative strength in August of that year. Expecting a tradable bounce above resistance of

its downtrend line, I zeroed in on the 50-day MA and noted that XHB had tried, but
failed, to break out above the resistance of its 50-day MA on four separate instances
occurring between the beginning of August and early September. Each successive test
of a key resistance level weakened the resistance and increased the odds of an eventual
breakthrough. The breakout above the 50-day MA fi nally came on September 12,
right after XHB undercut support of its prior low on the daily chart. See Figure 9.22.
I bought the fi rst pullback the following morning.
There are a couple of notable things in this chart. First, notice how the 50-day
MA perfectly acted as resistance to put the brakes on the reversal attempt of XHB
on four separate occasions (each one is circled). Then, notice the undercut below the
prior low that occurred on September 7 (A). This is a good example of a shakeout
(also see Figure 9.1). This probe below support of the prior low, which absorbed a
lot of overhead supply in the sector, washed out the weak hands. That’s why the next
breakout attempt was successful just three days later. I bought on September 13 (B).

area of support from a prior low, that’s usually the sign that the fi nal washout has been
completed and the ETF is now ready to move higher.
Ideally, I would have bought XHB when it convincingly broke out on September
12. However, I made the decision to wait for further price confi rmation of a strong
close that day, opting to buy the fi rst small retracement the following day. This was a

slightly different entry, in that I looked for an intraday pullback within the context of
a breakout on the daily chart. Normally, I buy the breakout both intraday and on the
daily chart. In this case, I lowered the risk by waiting for a small pullback the follow-
ing day. The 15-minute intraday chart at the time of entry is shown in Figure 9.23.
Because XHB was intended to just be a momentum trade on the trend reversal,
I didn’t have overly high expectations of a strong rally, such as what often occurs on
breakouts to new 52-week highs. Instead, I merely opted to play momentum and
sell on the fi rst sign that momentum may be running out. That occurred nearly one
month after entry, when I sold on October 10. See Figure 9.24 for the exit.
The exit coincided with a rally into the upper channel of the newly established
uptrend. I sold XHB due to its weak close on October 10, which was likely to precede
a move back down to the lower channel of the uptrend. That’s what began to hap-
pen three days later. One month after the exit, XHB had fallen back below the entry
price and its 50-day MA, but that didn’t matter because the goal was only to trade the
momentum of the trend reversal and get out before the ETF had a chance to move
back down.

Trading ETFs: Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis, Second Edition
by Deron Wagner

CHAPTER 10
Ten ETFs Sold Short
If you’ve avoided short selling because you’re not comfortable with identifying such
setups, this chapter can help you. It continues the discussion on how to time your
entries and exits, focusing on actual exchange-traded fund short sales taken.
Short Setups
For a long trade setup, one of the important things to look for is convergence of several
support levels on multiple time frames. The opposite is true for short setups, in that you
want to see a convergence of overhead resistance levels on multiple time frames. Most of
the strategies and trade setups for buying ETFs work just as well on the short side, except
that the patterns are reversed. Instead of buying pullbacks to uptrend lines, you sell short
rallies into resistance of the downtrend lines. Rather than buying breakouts above the
highs of consolidation, you sell short breakdowns below the lows of consolidation.
While reviewing the actual ETF short sales in this chapter, you may notice that
the durations for holding the positions are sometimes shorter than for the positions
I have bought long. This is because moves to the downside tend to occur more quickly
and violently, thus often providing a profi t potential similar to that of buying an ETF,
but in a much shorter period of time. Since the stock market has a natural tendency
to trend higher in the long term, it doesn’t pay to be greedy on the short side. Rather,
this is merely a way to supplement your cash portfolio in bearish markets instead of
completely sitting on the sidelines.
Resumption of an Established Downtrend
When the subprime mortgage fi asco started coming to light in mid-2007, many
fi nancial sectors began to reverse their long-term uptrends, causing many fi nancial
ETFs to show relative weakness compared to the broad market. The Regional Bank
HOLDR (RKH) was no exception. See Table 10.1.

After pulling back from its 52-week high in February 2007, RKH traded in a
volatile, sideways range for several months. In May 2007, it attempted to climb back
to its prior high from February 2007, but stalled just shy of it. This formed the fi rst
lower high on the weekly chart that gave an indication of a potential reversal of overall
momentum. Because RKH was still trading above its 20-day and 50-day moving aver-
ages (MAs), however, it was still too early to sell short.
One month later, RKH fell below support of its 20-, 50-, and 200-day MAs, con-
fi rming the lower high that had formed on the weekly chart. With the trend reversal
confi rmed, it was then just a matter of getting the timing right for an entry that would
provide the most positive reward/risk ratio for a short sale.
By mid-July 2007, RKH was showing major resistance on both its daily and weekly
charts. Since longer time intervals carry more weight than shorter time frames, it was
encouraging that RKH had bumped into new resistance of its long-term uptrend line,
which it broke below the prior month. Figure 10.1 is a weekly chart of RKH. Notice
how it was unable to climb back above its prior uptrend line after it fell below it. You
can also see the lower high from May (circled).

With the break of a four-year uptrend providing the main impetus for the short
trade, I then turned to the shorter-term daily chart, illustrated in Figure 10.2, on which
the short entry and subsequent cover price are marked. As mentioned in Chapter 7, the
best entries are those in which multiple time frames align with one another. Typically,
you use longer-term charts to identify the actual ETF trade setup, and then switch to
the shorter-term charts to fi nd the most ideal and precise entry point.
On July 16 and 17, RKH formed bearish inverted-hammer candlesticks after try-
ing, but failing, to break out above the intermediate-term downtrend line. This alone
provided a decent short entry, but the setup was made even better by the fact that
resistance of both the 50- and 200-day MAs had converged with the downtrend line
as well (A). Going into July 18, the plan was to sell short RKH on a break of its July
17 low. Because of the July 18 opening gap down, the trigger for short entry happened
on the session open (B).
Due to RKH’s breakdown and primary trend reversal on the weekly chart, the
projected time frame for the RKH short sale was several weeks or longer. I planned
to stay short as long as RKH remained within its established downtrending channel
(shown in Figure 10.2), eventually using a trailing stop to close the position.
But I got a gift, as the plethora of overhead resistance levels caused RKH to plunge
sharply immediately after entry. Just one week after entry, RKH had fallen so hard
that it fell below the lower channel support of its established downtrending channel.
Had it not fallen so fast, I would have stayed short RKH longer, but it’s wise
to cover short positions into periods of panic selling. This was the opposite of how
I often sell long positions into parabolic uptrends that are indicative of short-term
tops. Panic selling often brings capitulation, which locks in a short-term bottom.

I made a judgment call to lock in a 5 percent gain of 8 points (C) just one week after
the short entry.
Head-and-Shoulders Pattern
On February 3, 2006, I identifi ed the formation of a right shoulder on a bearish head-
and-shoulders chart pattern on the hourly chart of the PHLX Oil Service Sector Index
($OSX). This is shown in Figure 10.3.
Because the $OSX is often closely related to the price of the crude oil commodity,
I next looked at a daily chart of the continuous crude oil contracts. Upon doing so, I
noticed that crude had stalled at the resistance of its prior high from August 2005,
forming a lower high in the process. This helped confi rm the bearish setup in the
$OSX. The failure of crude to move above its prior high is illustrated in Figure 10.4.
The head and shoulders on the hourly chart of the $OSX combined with the
lower high on the continuous crude oil contracts provided a valid reason for initiating
a short position in the sector. In comparing the various ETF families correlated with
the oil service sector, I found that the Oil Services HOLDR (OIH) had the pattern
most closely resembling the actual $OSX (Table 10.2). Therefore, I initiated a short
position in OIH on February 3, 2006, at a price of $150.10. The head-and-shoulders
pattern followed through, and I covered the short position seven days later at a price
of $139.65. The entries and exits are shown on the OIH daily chart of Figure 10.5.
Based on the distance from the top of the head down to the neckline, the pre-
dicted target in OIH was about 12 points below the neckline of $145, a projected
price of approximately $133. Nevertheless, I also knew that the key support of the
50-day MA was in the area of $139. Therefore, I played it conservatively and locked in
the 10-point gain into weakness when OIH tested support of its 50-day MA.

144 Timing Your Entries and Exits
Resumption of an Established Downtrend
From May through July 2006, the major indexes were in an intermediate-term correc-
tion off their 52-week highs. I waited for a bounce into resistance on the daily chart
of the S&P MidCap 400 Index before I initiated a short sale of the S&P MidCap 400
SPDR (MDY) (see Table 10.3), in anticipation of a resumption of the established
downtrend. This is the opposite type of setup in which I buy a pullback to support in
an uptrending ETF.
By the end of June 2006, most of the major indexes had moved back above the
200-day MAs that they were trading below for several weeks prior. Nevertheless, resis-
tance of their 50-day MAs loomed overhead. Since institutions view the 50-day MA as
a pivotal support/resistance level in established trends, I expected the main stock market
indexes would again fall victim to selling pressure when they began to test their 50-day
MAs from below. Further, the broad market had begun to show signs that its prior
rally was already running out of gas. One key signal was the relative weakness in the
Semiconductor Index ($SOX), which had already fallen below its prior low from June
and was dragging down the Nasdaq Composite. Further, breakouts generally began fail-
ing again, and overall volume was increasing near the highs. This combination of factors
signaled it was time to reshort one of the broad-based ETFs into the bounce off the June
lows, but the question was which of the major stock market indexes to sell short.
As always, the answer to that question came down to a matter of relative strength,
or actually relative weakness in this case. I compared the daily charts of the S&P 500,
the Nasdaq Composite, the Dow, the small-cap iShares Russell 2000 Index, and the
S&P MidCap 400 Index. In doing so, I was looking to see which showed the least
momentum on the bounce off the lows.
The small-cap Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 indexes typically show
relative strength and lead the other major indexes in a strong market. Conversely, both
indexes often fall the hardest when stocks enter a period of correction. This time was
no exception. Upon doing further analysis, I found that both the Russell 2000 and
S&P MidCap 400 indexes were the furthest away from their 50-day MAs, and also the
closest to falling back below their 200-day MAs that they had just broken out above.
This indicated relative weakness in both indexes. So, I then compared those two charts
to see which one of the two looked better.
Take a quick look at the daily charts of both the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) and
the S&P MidCap 400 SPDR (MDY) (see Figure 10.6 and Figure 10.7). Notice that

both ETFs showed similar patterns, in that they had stalled at their 50-day MAs and
were trading below resistance of their June 2 highs.
At the time of these setups, I was not bearish on the market in the short term,
but I was on the intermediate-term outlook. In the event the market resumed its
downtrend faster than expected, I wanted to be prepared with a short setup. Of the

broad-based ETFs, MDY showed the most relative weakness and was therefore the
one I decided to sell short if, and only if, it fell back down below its July 5 intraday
low and 200-day MA. Jumping the gun for an entry such as this is dangerous, so it
was important to wait for confi rmation that the downtrend was ready to resume. That
confi rmation came on July 7, at which time I sold short the initial shares, and followed
by selling short the remaining shares the next day. Figure 10.8 illustrates the entry
price, as well as the subsequent price action and exit price.
The specifi c impetus for selling short MDY on July 7 was that it had dropped back
down to its 200-day MA (the thick black line), after being unable to rally above its
50-day MA (the descending gray line). I anticipated that MDY would fall apart quickly
if the broad market weakness continued because it had already dropped back down to
its 200-day MA. I wanted confi rmation, however, that it would not probe below the
200-day MA and reverse sharply higher the next day. On the morning of July 10, MDY
briefl y attempted to rally, but it sold off again and closed below its 200-day MA. This
gave the confi rmation I was looking for, so I added to the position at that point.
The initial protective stop price of MDY was $140.39. I determined this price by
simply placing the stop above the resistance of the 50-day MA. Since the 50-day MA
previously stopped the rally on July 3, a second attempt to break through the 50-day
MA that succeeded would likely lead to much higher prices. Therefore, I wanted to
be out quickly if the 50-day MA were violated. Fortunately, that never happened. As
MDY began to drop in the days that followed, I trailed the stop lower to maximize the
gains while protecting the profi ts. I used a variety of indicators to determine where to
trail the stop, but resistance of the hourly downtrend line was the basis.

How did I determine the original downside price target? For trades with an
expected hold time of several days to a few weeks, I like to keep it simple and focus
on the last signifi cant prior low tends to provide support (or the last signifi cant high if
long). At the time of entry, the last signifi cant low that was set was the June 14 low of
$130.31. If MDY began dropping hard, it had very good odds of generating a reversal
of momentum. MDY worked out to be a textbook example, as it touched its prior
signifi cant low and then reversed right at the support of that level. This, of course,
did not mean that MDY could not go lower, but it served as the ideal place to cover a
short position if I was not willing to hold through a potential bullish retracement in
the opposite direction.
Just in case a higher low was formed, I locked in profi t on one-third of the posi-
tion into the weakness of the largest “down” candle, formed on July 13, and then
covered the rest of the position on July 18, as it formed a bullish hammer candlestick
off the June 14 low. The original target was reached on July 18, and I netted a gain of
more than 7 points on a majority of the share size. Within one hour of trading down
to that target area, MDY began to reverse with the broad market and actually closed
nearly 1.5 points higher than when I covered the position.
Because the price action of small- and mid-cap stocks often serves as an accurate
barometer of the overall market’s health, it’s a good idea to monitor the Russell 2000
and S&P MidCap 400 indexes on a regular basis. The fi nancial media discuss those
indexes less than the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq Composite, but their performance
tends to be more accurate at forecasting the market’s overall health.
Failed Breakdown below Support
Throughout the fi rst 10 months of 2004, the main stock market indexes were stuck
in a sideways to slightly lower range. As such, ETFs could be both bought and sold
short with equal odds of success. Eventually, all markets break out of trading ranges,
but there is sometimes little warning of when that will occur. This short trade entry
happened to coincide with the S&P 500 beginning to break higher out of its range in
November, which pulled the Retail HOLDR (RTH) along with it (Table 10.4). Still,
it’s a great example of the importance of managing losing positions properly. Begin
by looking at the daily chart in Figure 10.9, which shows the reason for the original
short entry.

At the beginning of October 2004, RTH attempted to enter an uptrend after recov-
ering back above its 200-day MA. The numerous wicks on the candlesticks at that time
show, however, that the rally attempt was unconvincing. On October 14, RTH drifted
back down to support of its 200-day MA, but held and bounced off it. While this should
have generated some upside momentum, RTH failed to move above its prior high,
forming a lower high instead. I therefore anticipated another test of the 200-day MA.
When an ETF is testing support of a key MA such as the 200-day MA, each sub-
sequent bounce off the support level increases the chances of the next test failing and
leading to a breakdown. Therefore, I expected decent odds that the next test of the
200-day MA would result in a break below support.
On October 25, that’s exactly what happened, as RTH broke below its 200-day
MA. Further, the breakdown coincided with a break of the 50-day MA that had con-
verged at the same level. This combination of events triggered the short entry in RTH
at a price of $90.63.
Upon entry, the initial stop price was $92.30. I arrived at that level by putting the
stop above the area of horizontal price resistance shown on the chart (Figure 10.9).
Although it was not above the absolute highs of the prior range, it was above the
candlestick bodies. Odds were good that if RTH rallied all the way back over whole
number resistance of $92, it was likely to go much higher regardless of the actual resis-
tance being above $92. Unfortunately, the market didn’t allow me much time to worry
about it, as RTH reversed with a vengeance, stopping me out just two days later. This
is shown in Figure 10.10.
The long candlestick that formed on October 27 (B) was quite bullish and
promptly stopped me out for a loss of 1.69 points. Nevertheless, this trade is a great

example of how failed breakdowns below support can reverse furiously. The same is
true of upside breakouts that fail to follow through.
When RTH suddenly reversed higher after faking everyone out below the 50-day
and 200-day MAs, all the short sellers were forced to cover. This action automatically
drove the price higher, which in turn attracted new buyers. This “bear trap” caused
RTH to rip much higher after stopping me out. Sometimes all the technicals are in
place and the trade setup is clear, but the trade simply doesn’t work out. When that
happens, all you can do is follow your plan by cutting your loss. Taking losses quickly
when the market proves the trade wrong is a hallmark of consistently profi table profes-
sional traders.
Breakdown below the 200-Day Moving Average
In the month preceding April 2006, I was observing the relative weakness the
Biotechnology Index ($BTK) was exhibiting. Within the sector, the Biotech HOLDR
(BBH) was acting particularly weak, but it kept bouncing off major support of its 200-
day MA (see Table 10.5). The fi rst test of its 200-day MA support came on February 10,
but I knew that an ETF will rarely fall through its 200-day MA without fi rst bouncing
off it at least once or twice. The following month, BBH bounced off its 200-day MA
two more times. On April 28, BBH again fell to its 200-day MA, but this time faltered
and merely remained glued to its 200-day MA for several days.
Each subsequent test of a 200-day MA increases the odds of the ETF fi nally break-
ing through it, which will inevitably occur if the ETF does not eventually establish

a new uptrend off the 200-day MA support. When an ETF breaks the 200-day MA
with a confi rmed downward thrust, it often presents a low-risk short-sale entry point.
Looking at the daily chart of BBH in Figure 10.11, notice how each bounce off
the 200-day MA showed less and less upward momentum, until the HOLDR eventu-
ally fell through. When it convincingly broke below its 200-day MA, with key resis-
tance of the 20-day and 50-day MAs just overhead, I initiated a short position. (Note
that the actual price of BBH has been adjusted to account for large dividends from
2006 to 2007, but the pattern is still the same.)
I intended to stay short BBH as long as it remained below its 10-day MA, but I
also knew that the prior low from mid-February could act as support. Therefore,
I decided to scale out of the position. This is shown on the chart in Figure 10.12.
On April 6, I covered half the BBH position on the fi rst test of its prior low from

when BBH probed below its mid-February low, but closed in the upper end of its
intraday range. This formed a bullish hammer candlestick formation, prompting me

Failed Breakout to a New High and Subsequent Trend Reversal
My short sale of the S&P Metals and Mining SPDR (XME) is an example of how
rapidly failed breakouts to new highs can reverse, as XME rallied to a new high,
but stayed there for only two days before falling back below the breakout level (see
Table 10.6). The inability of the breakout to remain intact triggered stops for the bulls
who bought above the pivot. This, in turn, attracted short sellers who saw an oppor-
tunity to capitalize on the anticipated downward momentum.
In this setup, support of the 50-day MA just below the breakout prompted me
to wait and analyze the price action for a few days before selling short. As anticipated,

XME bounced off its 50-day MA a few days later, but the test of support was short-
lived and unconvincing. The daily chart in Figure 10.13 illustrates the price action
leading up to the initial short entry on June 11, 2007.
The primary feature of this XME setup was that it not only failed the breakout
(A) but also was unable to hold above its 50-day MA for more than one day. The price
action on September 8 was quite strong, bouncing perfectly off the 50-day MA, but
XME gapped back down below its 50-day MA the following day. The combination
of the failed breakout and the subsequent break of the 50-day MA provided pretty
good odds of further downside, so I initiated the fi rst shares of the short position on
June 11 (C). I used resistance of the 10-day MA and the high of the large down candle
of June 7 (B) as a guide in setting the initial stop of $65.82. Figure 10.14 shows the
subsequent price action and exit prices of the short position.
XME stayed below its 50-day MA for only two days before rallying back above
it. Fortunately, I gave the stop enough wiggle room so as not to be knocked out of
the position on a move that pushed XME just marginally back above the 50-day MA.
After pushing back above its 50-day MA for just a few days, XME ran into new
resistance of its downtrend line that began with the June 1 high. This forced XME
back below its 50-day MA on June 20, forming another big down candle in the
process (B).
When XME moved back below its 50-day MA on June 20, this also caused a lower
high to be formed on the daily chart, giving even more confi rmation that another
move lower was imminent. As a result, I added to the position that day, within a few
cents of the initial entry price.

Four days later, XME had fallen all the way back down to test support of its prior
low from June 12. Because my position was heavier now, I covered half the short posi-
tion into weakness of that move, locking in a decent gain. The remaining shares were
covered the following day, June 27, because of the bullish candlestick pattern that
formed that day (C). With an average cover price of $60.29, the trade netted a total
gain of 3.33 points. June 27 also marked the low of the move before XME rallied back
to a new 52-week high the following month.
Failed Breakout to a New High and Subsequent Trend
Reversal (Short-Term)
A majority of my trades are done with a projected time horizon of at least two weeks.
Nevertheless, the occasional opportunity arises for a short-term momentum trade in
which I need to be either “right or right out.” This means it’s generally a rapid trade
with a hold time of only one to three days. The plan in such trades is either to be
quickly right and lock in a profi t or get right out and close the trade.
So that such trades will have a high enough winning percentage to make the
numbers work, I focus only on setups that have a higher than average success rate of
following through. One such setup is selling short breakouts of consolidation that
immediately fail to hold.
While breakouts to new highs are great buying opportunities, they are equally
good short-sale opportunities when they fail. Not only must all the bulls who bought

the consolidation close the position, but those who bought the breakout must as well.
This sudden exodus triggers a wave of downward momentum that, in turn, attracts
the attention of short sellers. In the blink of an eye, an ETF that was trading at a new
high just a few days ago may suddenly fall to its 50-day MA. Such was the case with
this short trade I took in the Dow Diamonds (DIA) (see Table 10.7).
The daily chart of DIA in Figure 10.15 shows both the entry and exit prices in
this quick trade after a 2-day hold time.
After breaking out to a new high (A), DIA held above support of the pivotal
breakout level for only two days before gapping down below it. The fact that the break
of support occurred in the form of an opening gap, rather than an intraday down-
trend, created a bearish situation because traders had less chance to exit the position
in an orderly fashion.
I sold short DIA when it broke below the low of its fi rst 30 minutes on September 23,
2003 (B) (see “Opening-Gap Rules” in Chapter 7). The entry price was $95.38, with

an initial stop of $96.50. The stop correlated with a breakout above the newly formed
hourly downtrend line, often an ideal level for setting short-term stops.
Because I knew the 50-day MA would likely act as support, I used the test of that
level as the exit point to cover the position into weakness. Though the actual point
gain was not very large, the initial plan of the trade was a short-term momentum trade.
As a result, I was not interested in hanging around to see how DIA reacted on the test
of the 50-day MA. I took the quick-and-easy profi t instead. Remember this example
for potential momentum short sales whenever you see failed breakouts in the market.
Breakdown below the 50-Day MA
In this short sale of the iShares Russell Index 2000 (IWM) (see Table 10.8), I waited for
a lower high to be formed on the daily chart, and then sold short the subsequent break
of the 50-day MA. Figure 10.16 is a snapshot of IWM’s price action at the time of entry.
The idea for the potential short entry in IWM came at the beginning of March, as
IWM popped above its consolidation that formed in February. To the casual observer,
this might be regarded as bullish, but breakouts above consolidations often fail when
there are prior levels of overhead resistance. This is the opposite of how ETFs will
often fake out the bulls by dropping below an area of support, but moving right back
above it a few days later.
When IWM began rallying in early March, no clear signal for a short entry pre-
sented itself. IWM grabbed my attention, however, when it fell back below the high of
its prior consolidation on March 8 (A). I knew if the breakout attempt failed, it would
also coincide with a lower high being formed on the daily chart (with the prior high
of December 2004), which could be the start of a longer-term downtrend. Therefore,
the balance of power was shifting to the short side after several months off the highs.
The only question was when to enter the short with the least amount of risk.
The answer was on a break below pivotal support of the 50-day MA. Though the
50-day MA provided support several times the prior month, the reason it was more
likely to fail this time was that the prior breakout also failed. This created more over-
head supply that was likely to push IWM lower. Remember how ETFs often won’t
break out to the upside until they have fi rst shaken out the weak hands? This was the
same scenario, except in reverse.

I entered a short position on March 16, 2005 (B). Take a look at Figure 10.17, to
see the subsequent price action after the short entry.
At the time of the short entry (A), the target price was a test of the prior lows from
January 2005 (the dashed horizontal line). To my delight, IWM smoothly trended
all the way down to perfectly test that support level before subsequently bouncing.

I covered on the test of the prior low (B), the original downside price target having
been satisfactorily achieved.
Upon covering the position, I knew there was still a decent chance that IWM
would break below its prior low from January and continue to slide further, but
I assumed it would fi rst bounce off the support level for a while. If it did (which
turned out to be the case), I would be watching it for a potential reentry point on the
short side. The bounce that subsequently came provided a better opportunity to reen-
ter the position at a better price than just staying short the original position.
Bounce into Resistance of a 50-Day MA
The fi rst time (see Table 10.2) I sold short the Oil Service HOLDR (OIH), I did
so because of the formation of a head-and-shoulders chart pattern. The setup in
Table 10.9 is different, however, as it shows a resumption of a newly established down-
trend that occurred after OIH ran into resistance of its 50-day MA. The 50-day MA
is always such a pivotal support/resistance level because many institutions use that
indicator for their intermediate-term buying and selling decisions.
On August 1, 2007, OIH fell to close below support of its 50-day MA for the fi rst
time in fi ve months. In the process, it broke below its primary uptrend line as well.
Rather than shorting the initial breakdown, I wanted to fi rst observe subsequent price
action to ensure the drop below support was not just a shakeout that would quickly
snap back up.
OIH traded below its 50-day MA for fi ve more days before retracing to test new
resistance of the 50-day MA. It was unable to penetrate resistance on the fi rst attempt,
but I again used patience to make sure it wouldn’t rip through the next day. Three days
after the fi rst test of the 50-day MA, OIH once again tried and failed to recover back
above the 50-day MA. This is shown at point A in Figure 10.18.
In both tests, new resistance of the 50-day MA perfectly marked the highs of each
day’s rally. With resistance of the 50-day MA now being fi rmly established, I decided
to sell short OIH the following day if it fell below the prior day’s low.
Due to its relative weakness and the established resistance of the 50-day MA, I sold
short OIH on August 14, when it broke the prior day’s low (B). The reward/risk ratio
for the trade was not ideal, however, as support of the last prior low, from two weeks
earlier, was not far below the current price. With such a short period of time between

sell-offs, odds were slightly increased that the prior test of support would hold intact.
Therefore, rather than holding OIH with the expectation that much lower prices
would follow, I decided to merely trade the short-term downward momentum and
cover into weakness on the test of the prior low. That’s what I did, as the test of the
prior low came only two days later. See Figure 10.19.

The exit turned out to be ideal because OIH formed a bullish hammer candle-
stick that day and reversed all the way back to an all-time high one month later.
Sometimes your expectations for a trade may diminish if you observe subsequent
price action after your entry. When that happens, you must simply take what the mar-
ket gives you, not hold on and try to force the market to do what you want. Further,
remember the goal of your overall trading strategy is not to squeeze every single dollar
of profi t out of a trade, but rather to catch a bulk of the profi ts in the middle, and
with minimal risk.
Break of a Symmetrical Triangle Chart Pattern
The short sale of iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (FXI), shown in Table 10.10,
was a bit different from the others, as it involved trading the break of support in a “sym-
metrical triangle” chart pattern. This pattern occurs when prices oscillating in a sideways
range continually get tighter and tighter, in a volatility contraction, near the middle of
that range over a period of weeks. It results in the formation of a downtrend line along
the highs of each day, as well as an uptrend line along the lows. A symmetrical triangle is
neither a bullish nor a bearish chart pattern. Rather, it is merely a pattern that predicts a
large expansion of volatility. If you are fast enough to catch the beginning of the expan-
sion in whichever direction it goes, the resulting profi ts can be quite substantial and
rapid. Figure 10.20 illustrates the setup just before the day of entry.
Initially, I intended to buy FXI when it rallied above the February 8 high of
$107.50, but I passed on the entry because the volume failed to signifi cantly increase
when the ETF moved above that prior high on February 21. It formed a “doji star”
candlestick the following day (the down arrow), and then promptly fell 2.4 percent
the day after that, February 23.
Because FXI appeared to have failed its breakout attempt, it made an ideal short setup.
Instead of merely falling below the lower trend channel of the triangle, it fi rst rallied above
the upper channel, drawing in the bulls. Now that the bulls who bought the breakout were
trapped, the downward momentum would increase if and when FXI broke down.
Since FXI already closed just below support of both its 20-day and 50-day MAs, it
was ideal for short entry about 30 to 40 cents below the February 23 low. A protective
stop was placed just above the high of February 23. Support of the January 10 low,
around $98, was the realistic downside price target. I sold short FXI on February 26
(entry shown in Figure 10.20).

To my surprise, luck was on my side: The following day, the Shanghai stock mar-
ket tumbled more than 9 percent, triggering subsequent massive losses in the U.S.
markets. Obviously, I had no way of knowing that would happen right after the short
entry, as I was merely trading the chart pattern. Nevertheless, when you get a gift, it’s
wise to take it.

Unexpectedly, one day after my short entry on February 26, FXI fell to the original
downside price target of the January 10 low, shortly after the day’s open. I covered at
$97.41(C), locking in a gain of nearly 8 points on the 1-day hold time. The daily chart
in Figure 10.21 shows how FXI actually exceeded the price target by several points,
but I still followed the plan and covered the position at the predetermined target price.
When you happen to get a bit of luck to help your well-planned technical entry,
it’s best to take advantage of the good fortune instead of being greedy. FXI hit the
target of the prior low, so I took the money and ran. It didn’t matter that it happened
only one day after my short entry. I was rewarded for my discipline, as FXI only
went lower for one day, and then never moved that low again. Eight months later, in
September 2007, FXI was trading at double the price of when I profi ted on this one-
day short sale.

Trading ETFs: Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis, Second Edition
by Deron Wagner
Copyright © 2012 Deron Wagner
CHAPTER 11
Tailoring Your Approach
Now that you’ve learned strategies that rely on technical analysis for trading ETFs
and have seen 20 real applications, I want to share some key ideas that will help you
custom-tailor your approach.
In this chapter, you will learn about my model for sizing ETF positions on each
and every trade. This approach ensures that your risk remains consistent with every
position taken. Next, you will receive some pointers on how to achieve the most effi -
cient ETF trade executions. Finally, I will describe a simple way to take the strategies
taught in this book and apply them to intraday trading. This will be of interest to
those of you who want to day-trade ETFs.
Position Sizing
Although most traders use protective stops and limit their risk on every trade, what
many lack is a concrete way to ensure they are maintaining a similar risk exposure with
each open position. Too little capital exposure on an ETF trade can be just as damag-
ing as too much risk, as the average winning trade needs to be larger than the average
losing trade for net long-term profi tability.
The position-sizing technique presented here is not only a guide to keep maxi-
mum risk consistent with every position, but it is also a way to ensure that your buy-
ing power receives maximum bang for the buck.
This model for position sizing of ETFs is based on a technical indicator known as
average true range (ATR). The ATR is a number derived from a formula that enables
you to compare the volatility of various stocks and ETFs. As the name implies, aver-
age true range indicates how many points a ticker moves in an average day, including
gaps. If, for example, the Oil Services HOLDR (OIH) has an ATR of 2.5, the average
range between its intraday low and high on any given day, including opening gaps,
is 2.5 points. The higher its ATR number, the more volatile the ETF is likely to be.
Some traders adjust their position size based solely on the ATR of a stock or an
ETF, but this is not enough. It’s not surprising that a more expensive stock or ETF is
usually going to be more volatile than a lower-priced one. Similarly, there are many

==================================================

166 Fine-Tuning Your Strategy
ETFs that have a low ATR, but only because they are also trading at a low price.
Therefore, basing sizing positions on ATR alone is not suffi cient.
If you take the ATR position-sizing model a step further by also factoring in the
price of the ETF, you will not only know how volatile an ETF is, but how volatile it
is compared to its price. You can then use this information to know how much profi t
potential any ETF is likely to yield, relative to the amount of capital required. Those
ETFs with a higher ratio are going to automatically make better use of your buying
power than those with a low ratio. The following is the position-sizing formula:
Average closing price of last 10 days ÷ 50-day ATR = Size Ratio
Before I explain the above formula further, you fi rst need to understand why I use
a 10-day average close instead of just the last closing price.
Instead of comparing the ATR of an ETF to its market price on just a single day,
I look at the average closing price of the past 10 days, which helps smooth out any
price anomaly that may have arisen from a large gap on a particular day. The average
closing price of the past 10 days is exactly the same value as the current 10-day simple
MA of an ETF.
As for the ATR portion of the equation, notice that I calculate the average true
range over a period of 50 days. Although many technical analysts might use a shorter
period, your goal is once again to smooth out any irregularities in the volatility that
could occur as a result of a news event on any given day. ATR is an indicator that is
easily calculated by most direct access trading platforms.
Here is an actual example of this formula in use. On July 23, 2007, the
Semiconductor HOLDR (SMH) closed at a price of $38.32. Its average closing price
in the preceding 10 days (10-day MA) was $38.14. Its 50-day ATR was 0.78. Using
the position-sizing formula, you get the following result:
$38.14 ÷ 0.78 = 48.9
The result of 48.9 is typical, as the formula usually yields a number between 30
and 100. The lower the number, the more volatile the ETF will be in relation to its
price. The higher the number, the less volatile it is in relation to its price. If several
ETF families within the same sector index have similar chart patterns, you would opt
for the one with the lowest Size Ratio, since a greater amount of potential profi ts can
be achieved with the same amount of buying power.
Because a lower number translates to more volatility in relation to price, you
must also control risk by adjusting your share size based on the volatility of each ETF.
While you study the guidelines below, you may want to tweak them to meet your
personal risk comfort level. If one of your main priorities is steady monthly returns
with minimal monthly drawdowns in the losing months, you may want to err on the
conservative side.
If the Size Ratio falls in the range of 50 to 75, you make no special adjustments
for share size. If, for example, your normal capital exposure per trade is set at 5 percent



==================================================
                     PAGE 169                     
==================================================

Tailoring Your Approach 167
of total capital (which is conservative), you can buy or sell short the appropriate num-
ber of shares to match that capital exposure. With a $100,000 trading account, that
would translate to a $5,000 ETF position. ETFs such as the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY)
and the Nasdaq 100 Index Tracking Stock (QQQQ) usually fall into this range.
If the Size Ratio is lower than 50, reduce your total position size by 25 percent,
and also increase the protective stop distance by the same percentage. If, for example,
you want a normal capital exposure of 5 percent per trade, an ETF with a Size Ratio
of 40 would require you to reduce your share size to just 3.75 percent of the account’s
capital. A lower share size keeps risk due to higher volatility in line, which also gives
the stop more room. If your normal stop level is 4 percent beyond the price at time
of entry, you would allow for a 5 percent stop. The net result is the same overall risk
exposure as a less volatile position. ETFs such as the iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25
Index (FXI) and the Oil Services HOLDR (OIH) usually fall into this category. Also,
most of the leveraged ETFs in the ProShares family are in this range.
If the Size Ratio is greater than 75, you increase your share size by 25 percent to
make up for the low volatility. With a baseline 5 percent capital exposure per posi-
tion, you would allow up to 6.25 percent exposure. Failure to do so would result in a
winning trade not yielding a substantial enough profi t. Because the ETF has a lower
volatility, you would typically reduce your protective stop distance by 25 percent as
well. Slow movers such as most of the fi xed-income (bond) ETFs usually fall into this
category. Nevertheless, they are not to be disregarded because the large amount of
dividend distributions makes up for the decreased volatility.
Note that the guidelines above are exactly that—guidelines. They were not derived
from any high-tech mathematical algorithm. They were, however, derived from years
of experience in trading all types of ETFs. These are just the ranges that I’ve found
work best for maintaining a similar risk for each position, regardless of the price or
volatility of the ETF.
ECNs
In the old days of calling in all your trade orders to a broker, the only way for them to
be executed was through a specialist (for NYSE stocks) or market maker (for Nasdaq
issues). The basic auction system worked in such a way that specialists or market mak-
ers took your buy or sell order and matched it up with another order on the other side
of the trade. In the process, the specialist matching up the trades took a big chunk out of
the middle, known as the “bid/ask spread.” While this system was moderately effi -
cient, the problem was that the specialist could easily take advantage of the situation
by taking his precious time fi lling the market order in fast-moving markets, as well as
opening the spread wider in order to maximize his profi ts. Fortunately, the invention
of the electronic communications network (ECN) immediately began to solve these
problems for the average retail trader.
You can thank Instinet, invented in the 1970s by an aerospace analyst with a dream
of eliminating stock market middlemen, for creating the technological framework

==================================================

168 Fine-Tuning Your Strategy
that made ECNs possible. Since then, numerous ECNs have spawned, leveling the
playing fi eld for the average investor or trader.
The basic task of an ECN is to electronically match buy and sell orders as quickly and
inexpensively as possible. Unlike the fi rst ECN, Instinet, which matched only the orders
of institutional investors, the ECNs of today automatically match all orders, including
those of retail and institutional investors, without any human interaction. It is an equi-
table fi rst-come, fi rst-served system that gives no preference to the size of the trade.
All modern ECNs work in conjunction with the various stock exchanges to pro-
vide liquidity and competitive prices for customers. Because ECNs compete with
market makers and specialists for customer orders, the spreads between the bid and
ask prices have narrowed over the years. Unlike professional market makers and spe-
cialists, ECNs are computerized systems that do not profi t from the spread. Rather,
the owners of the ECNs realize profi ts by charging a very small fee per share of stock or
ETF executed. They do all the work behind the scenes, enabling most online broker-
ages to process orders for a small fraction of the previous costs.
With regard to ETF trading, there are a number of advantages to using an ECN to
place your orders. Most important is that you will get better order fi lls by paying only
the price you want to pay. The transparency of ETF “order books,” which enable trad-
ers to see the size and price of every buy/sell order, typically allows you to get an instan-
taneous order match on your executions, assuming your order is at or near the market
price. Executing your orders through a traditional specialist is often much slower and
results in worse order fi lls. By using ECNs, you eliminate many of the steps a broker
must take, resulting in faster order executions and better price fi lls. Because there is
minimal human interaction, the cost of fi lling your order is reduced, which allows
brokerage fi rms to charge lower commission rates on orders executed through ECNs.
Near the peak of the year 2000 bull market, many ECNs were competing for
market share. Nevertheless, acquisitions and consolidations have considerably reduced
(and simplifi ed) your ECN order routing options. The dominant players are now
Archipelago (ARCA) and Instinet (INCA).
Many online brokers now provide traders and investors with a choice between
routing your order to a specialist or ECN such as ARCA or INCA. If unsure of your
broker’s options and capabilities, give him a call and ask how orders are routed. If he
tells you orders are routed directly to the fl oor of the exchanges, it means orders are
being routed in the traditional way, to a specialist or market maker. If this is the only
option provided, it may be time to switch to a broker who provides you with the greater
effi ciency, lower cost, and more rapid order executions that ECNs provide. The dif-
ference won’t be noticeable on a single trade, but the savings add up over the months.
Market or Limit?
As a general rule, I use market orders for executing both buy and sell orders. The rea-
soning behind this is simple: It’s better to get a bad fi ll and catch a 5-point move than
to miss getting fi lled by 5 cents and watching the trade run 6 points without you in it.

==================================================

Tailoring Your Approach 169
Because I am typically looking to make multiple points of profi t from trades
with multiweek time horizons, I don’t worry about giving up nickels or dimes. This
is a lesson I have learned from my mistakes of the past when my insistence on get-
ting a good fi ll continually caused me to miss substantial profi ts. I soon learned that
being stubborn by using tight limit orders is not as profi table as simply trying to get
an average-priced execution over the long term. Nevertheless, there are indeed some
instances when I do use limit orders on ETF trades.
The bid/ask spread of the actual ETF determines when to use limit orders, as
some ETFs trade with much tighter spreads than others. In general, the higher the
average daily volume of a particular ETF, the more likely I am to use a market order.
Since high-volume ETFs generally trade with a spread of only 1 to 5 cents, I usually
get good fi lls with market orders and don’t have to worry about chasing the price for
pennies. When an ETF is not very popular, however, the spread will typically widen in
relation to the lower average daily volume. In those cases, I prefer to use a limit order.
With the less popular ETFs, I have found the best strategy is to place your order
either slightly above or below the middle of the spread, depending on whether you’re
trying to buy or sell. If you are buying, place the order about 5 cents above the middle
of the spread, and place it fi ve cents below the middle of the spread if you are selling
or selling short (remember there is no uptick rule).
For example, assume you are trying to buy Biotech HOLDR (BBH) when the best
bid is 183.20 and the best offer is 183.40. Assuming the market is not fast-moving,
you would probably place a limit buy order around 183.30. In a fast-moving market,
however, you would place the order a little higher, maybe even go with a market order
if you felt confi dent it was about to run a few points. Remember, your goal is not to
catch every single cent of a move but just a good piece of the move with minimal risk.
Identifying Relative Strength Intraday
Although most of my trades have an average time horizon of several weeks to several
months, I often look for relative strength on an intraday basis, just to confi rm the tim-
ing for the targeted trade entry is still correct. The step-by-step process that follows
is one effi cient way of doing so. Further, for those of you who also day-trade, these
concepts can help you identify ideal ETF trading opportunities early on.
The basic idea is to apply the steps of the top-down strategy to a shorter time
frame. It is essentially the same top-down process for identifying the best relative
strength within the sector, and then narrowing it down to the strongest individual
ETF family within the sector, but applied on a shorter time frame.
Selecting the Sector Indexes with Relative Strength
For identifying relative strength intraday, it is easier to use the numerical method of
listing all the sector indexes on a market minder, as opposed to viewing all the percent-
age-change charts described in Chapter 5. Once again, you want to set up a table on

your trading software of the main industry sectors and indexes you are interested in,
sorted by daily percentage change, similar to what you see in Figure 11.1.
Be sure to set up a table, like Figure 11.1, that can be dynamically sorted in real
time, in descending order, based on the percentage change from the previous day’s
close. If you are using a package without real-time data or the ability to dynamically
sort, be sure to refresh the data frequently.
Relative Strength among the Indexes
At 9:35 a.m. Eastern time (ET), fi ve minutes after the market opens, record the percent-
age changes of all the major sector indexes, the specialty indexes you track, and the major
indexes. The easiest way to do this is to print your quote screen and record the time of

                     PAGE 173                     
==================================================

Tailoring Your Approach 171
the printout. Note that you are not interested in how much any of the sector indexes
have moved during the fi rst 5 minutes of trading. Rather, by waiting 5 minutes, you are
giving these instruments time to open, and recording how high or low they have gapped
from their previous day’s closing prices. This is essentially the same as noting opening
prices, but with a more realistic 5-minute delay. You will then use this data to compare
which sector indexes have moved the most after the fi rst 30 minutes of trading.
By 10 a.m., the stock market will have entered the fi rst “reversal period” of the day.
This is a time when stocks and ETFs often retrace slightly from their opening price
moves. The direction the major indexes settle into after 10 a.m. is usually the direction
that defi nes the entire morning trading session.
At this time, 30 minutes after the market opens, you once again print out your
market minder with all the sector indexes, the specialty indexes, and the major indexes.
Compare this printout with the fi rst one from 9:35 a.m. Generally, you are looking to
see which indexes have moved the most right out of the starting gates. To do this, start
with the sectors or indexes at the top of your list, dynamically sorted by percentage
change, and then subtract the percentage change from your fi rst printout.
The reason you do the manual calculation is to see which indexes have moved the
most in the fi rst 30 minutes of trading. Most of the time, these will be the sectors with
the most intraday relative strength throughout the entire day. If you merely looked
at the top gainers in absolute percentage terms, the gains can be deceiving because
opening gaps to the upside are not factored in.
Consider the following example:
The Dow Jones Utility Average ($DJUA) is showing a gain of 1.7 percent from
the previous day’s close as of 10 a.m. When you did the initial check at 9:35 a.m., the
index was already up 1.6 percent. Separately, you note that the Semiconductor Index
($SOX) is showing a gain of 1.4 percent as of 10 a.m., but the $SOX is only up 0.3
percent after the fi rst fi ve minutes of trading. Even though the gain in the utilities
sector is larger than in the semiconductor sector in absolute percentage terms, the
semiconductor sector has more intraday relative strength because it moved a much
greater percentage since the open. Nearly all the gain in the utilities was a result of the
opening gap. This is why you note the change in percentage gains after the fi rst thirty
minutes instead of just looking at the total absolute gains.
If the overall market is in an established downtrend, remember that the fi rst
step of the top-down system is to trade in the overall direction of the major indexes.
This means you would be looking for the sectors showing the most relative weakness
instead of strength, those sectors that have fallen the most in the fi rst thirty minutes
of trading.
Strength Relative to the Index Itself
After you identify the indexes with the most early relative strength or weakness com-
pared to the broad market, the next step is to confi rm that the index is also showing
relative strength compared to itself. This is done by ensuring that your long candidate
is trading in the top third of its intraday range or the short candidate is trading in the



==================================================

==================================================

172 Fine-Tuning Your Strategy
bottom third of its range. If any of your indexes fail to meet these criteria, the sector
has probably lost its early relative strength or weakness and should be discarded as a
potential trade candidate.
In this event, move on to the index that has made the second-largest percentage
move from the open and determine if it is showing relative strength compared to itself
by trading in the top third of its intraday range. Repeat this process until you fi nd an
index that is trading within the top third of its intraday range (or the bottom third for
a short). Most of the time, the fi rst index that has moved the largest percentage from
the open will also be trading within the top or bottom third of its range. If the opening
gap was driven by news, however, all the excitement may have already fi zzled out on
the open. This method of ensuring that the index has relative strength to itself is one
way to prevent that scenario.
Narrowing Down to the Individual ETF
After making sure the sector index has not only relative strength compared to other
indexes, but also to itself, you next look in your ETF Roundup guide (see Chapter 5),
or your predetermined groupings of ETFs you otherwise follow, to briefl y compare
the various ETF fund families within the sector. Using chart overlays with the percent-
age-change charts of all the ETF families for each sector is a quick way to see which
individual ETF is the strongest within the sector. Select the ETF family with the most
relative strength.
Confi rming Volume
The fi nal step is ensuring the volume is strong enough to confi rm the relative strength
or weakness of your ETF. The stronger the volume of the ETF, or leading stocks
within the index, the better the setup. Volume in both the long and short candidates
should be equal to or greater than their average daily volumes in the fi rst 30 minutes
of trading over the past fi ve days. The easiest way to fi nd out if this is the case is to plot
a moving average of intraday volume. Alternatively, you can simply eyeball the volume
bars on a 5- or 15-minute chart for each day of trading over the past fi ve days, getting
a quick feel for whether the day’s volume is substantial.
At the end of the screening process described above, you will be left with the best
long and short trade candidates, based on their relative strength and weakness that day.
Finding an Entry Point
To fi nd the lowest-risk entry point on a long candidate, wait for a 0.382 (38.2 per-
cent) Fibonacci retracement of the total range from the ETF’s intraday low to its
intraday high within the fi rst 30 minutes of trading. The opposite scenario applies for
short candidates.
If your ETF candidate has not made a .382 Fibonacci retracement by10:15 a.m.
ET, it usually means there is a higher probability the trend will continue because the

relative strength is very high. As a result, if a price correction has not occurred by
10:15 a.m.—that is, a “correction by time” has occurred instead—you simply enter
the trade at the market.
If you follow these steps, you should be positioned in either the ETF with the most
relative strength or relative weakness within the fi rst 45 minutes of the trading day.
Exiting and Stopping
As for stop prices, this completely depends on your objective. If, for example, you were
just using intraday entry techniques to improve your entry price on a multiweek trade,
then you don’t need to worry about anything other than your preplanned protective
stop. If, however, you plan to only day-trade the entry, using MAs and intraday trend-
lines on the short-term 5- and 15-minute charts is important.
Putting It All Together: Trade Entry Example
Assume it’s June 21, 2007, and you would like to use the above strategy for intraday
ETF trading. Following the initial steps detailed above, you compare the percentage
changes of the major industry sectors at 9:35 a.m., noting which one is among those
showing strongest gains on the open, as well as the percentage change of the S&P
500 Index. In doing so, you observe that the Semiconductor Index ($SOX) is already
showing a gain of 0.6 percent, compared to just a 0.1 percent gain in the S&P 500.
Twenty-fi ve minutes later, you again print the screenshot of all the sectors, compar-
ing the percentages with those from the initial observation fi ve minutes after the open.
You now notice that the S&P 500 has fallen to a loss of 0.4 percent from the previous
day’s close, but the $SOX is still holding near the intraday high, showing the same
gain of 0.6 percent. This clearly indicates relative strength, as the sectors that don’t
fall with the broad market will be the fi rst ones to rally to new highs when the major
indexes eventually bounce. Table 11.1 summarizes the actual observations you would
have made if you were trading that morning.
Having confi rmed that the $SOX index has strength relative to the broad market,
you next confi rm the index is also showing relative strength compared to itself. The
easiest way to do this is to look at the percentage-range column on your sector market
minder, making sure the $SOX is trading in the upper third of its intraday range.
Alternatively, a quick glance at the 1-minute intraday chart in Figure 11.2 would
graphically show you the same thing.

Notice in the chart how the $SOX initially moved lower, about 10 minutes after
the open. However, it held above the previous day’s close as the S&P 500 moved into
negative territory, thus confi rming its relative strength. By 10:00 a.m., the $SOX had
brushed off the pullback and recovered back to consolidate at its intraday high. When
this type of action occurs, odds are good the index will be the fi rst to break out to new
highs that day as soon as the broad market bounces as well.
If your candidate passes the relative strength tests, you would next confi rm the
presence of higher than average volume within the sector. This is most easily accom-
plished by taking a quick look at the opening volume bars of the various ETFs that
comprise the sector.
The next step, assuming the volume is at least on par to be better than average,
is to select the specifi c semiconductor ETF showing the most relative strength within
the sector. The percentage-change overlay chart in Figure 11. 3 enables you to do that.
(See Chapter 4 to review how to create this type of chart.)
Of the four ETFs that are correlated to the $SOX, notice that the Semi-conductor
HOLDR (SMH) was showing the largest gain by 10:00 a.m. It therefore has the most
relative strength and is the one that should be bought. Remember to always buy the
leaders, not the laggards.
Now that you have identifi ed both sector and individual-ETF relative strength,
the next step is to time the entry. This can be done by either waiting for a 38.2 percent

CHAPTER 12
Additional Pointers
In this chapter, I provide some fi nal thoughts to take away with you. These are not
rules for my strategy but advice on dealing with scenarios that you will occasionally
come across.
Assessing Your Trades
When I began trading, I was under the assumption that the way to determine whether
a trade was successful was based simply on whether the trade was profi table. If a
trade netted me a profi t, I assumed I had made a good trade. Conversely, I automat-
ically thought losing trades were bad trades that I probably should not have entered.
Although this simple methodology seemed logical, I soon learned that this method of
analyzing my trades was highly fl awed and was actually the opposite approach of what
was necessary for long-term success as a trader.
I eventually learned I needed to evaluate my trades based on whether I made the
right decision and stuck to my trading plan, as opposed to whether the trade resulted
in profi ts. I learned that if I focused on simply making the right decisions rather than
on making a profi t on each trade, the profi ts would automatically come over the long
term. The problem with judging trades purely on profi tability was that the occasions
when I accidentally profi ted from poor trading decisions or lack of discipline reinforced
bad habits that were detrimental to my overall profi tability. To achieve and maintain
long-term success as a trader, it is crucial to have the discipline to stick to your per-
sonal trading plan every day of the year. Admittedly, it is sometimes diffi cult to know
whether you are truly sticking to your plan in the heat of battle during the trading day.
An effective way to determine if you made the right decision is to get in the habit of
asking yourself this one very important question: Would I do the same thing again,
knowing what I now know? In other words, after seeing the results of the trade, if it
worked out or not, would you make the same trade again without changing a thing?
If the answer is an unequivocal yes, you made the right decision and should feel
good about the trade, whether it resulted in profi ts or not. Although you are obviously
going to have losing trades even when you did everything right and stuck to the plan,

you will be profi table over the long term if you never stray from your plan and always
focus on making the proper decisions.
Figure 12.1, a daily chart of the Retail HOLDR (RTH) that was intended to be a
multiday swing trade when I bought it, details a typical losing trade.
I bought RTH when it broke out above its intermediate-term downtrend line (A).
The break of the downtrend line also coincided with a rally above the 20-day expo-
nential moving average (EMA), which should have become the new support level as
well. Therefore, upon entry, I set the stop below both the 20-day EMA and the newly
formed hourly uptrend line (B). I assumed that RTH would dip below the 20-day
EMA and run stops, but that support of the new hourly uptrend line would catch it.
If not, I wanted to be out fast, so a protective stop below the hourly uptrend line (B)
was logical.
Despite a bullish consolidation above the 20-day EMA, RTH did not follow
through to the upside. On January 16, 2003, RTH probed below its 20-day EMA
and hourly uptrend line on an intraday basis, but it closed above both technical levels
of support. The following day, however, RTH fi rmly closed below both. When this
happened, I stuck to my predetermined plan and took the stop at point C, realizing
a loss on the trade. This turned out to be a great move because RTH dropped nearly
5 more points in the weeks that followed.
While analyzing the trade, I looked back at the chart and net result of the trade
and asked myself, “Would I do the same thing again, knowing what I now know?”
Despite getting stopped out, I answered yes, because I had a solid reason for enter-
ing the trade, the stop was in the right place, and I was disciplined by taking the loss.

==================================================

Additional Pointers 179
Conversely, if the trade had broken below the 20-day moving average and I had not
cut the loss, the answer to the question would have been no, as I would not have been
sticking to my plan. It also would have been bad if I’d stayed in RTH after it broke
well below the 20-day MA, even if it reversed back up and made a profi t. As men-
tioned earlier, making profi ts from an incorrect trading decision or lack of decision is
never a good thing because of the bad habits it reinforces.
Choppy and Indecisive Markets
Don’t get discouraged when you are having a diffi cult time profi ting under choppy
and indecisive market conditions, which often become quite erratic. Think of yourself
in such trading environments as a weightlifter trying to become muscular and buff.
While you are doing all the hard work, pumping iron, your task is very diffi cult
and results are not immediately seen. You may even become discouraged. Once your
muscles are fi nally built up, however, you will be in top form, and it will take much
less effort to keep the muscles toned. If you can survive the early periods by keeping
losses small, you will have your muscles developed by the time things improve (and
they eventually will). If you work hard at building a solid, disciplined plan when
things are not so easy, you will be on top of your game when the smooth trends return.
Make capital preservation your number one goal so that you will still be around to
capitalize on better times as a much stronger trader. Remember to ask yourself that
all-important question: Would I do the same thing again, knowing what I now know?
As long as the answer is yes, you should feel good about your trade results, knowing
that you will be profi table in the long run as long as you stick to your trading plan
and don’t worry about the day-to-day profi t and loss results. Above all, remember that
cash is a very valid position and that the most profi table private traders are out of the
markets more than they are in the markets.
Proper Trigger Prices
After you’ve selected the best exchange-traded funds and designated your proper entry
and exit points, it’s crucial to maintain discipline and not jump the gun by entering a
position ahead of its predetermined trigger price. The temptation will always be there,
as people like to think they can get a “better” price. You must remember, however,
what “support” and “resistance” levels mean—and realize that buying before a clear
break of resistance or selling short before a breakdown below support is a sure recipe
for excessive stop-outs.
Sometimes, I’ll see a potential ETF trade setup I think might have the potential
for generating large profi ts if the ETF moves above a key area of resistance. In such a case,
the trigger price for entry will always be above that resistance level, thereby forcing the
ETF to confi rm its relative strength. If a trader makes the mistake of jumping into
the position ahead of its actual trigger price, the result is often negative.

Figure 12.2 is an actual example of an ETF I was stalking for a potential break-
out above horizontal price resistance. It happened that the breakout failed to follow
through. Had I jumped the gun with an early entry, a loss would have been sustained,
but having the patience to wait for the proper trigger price prevented me from ever
entering in the fi rst place. No harm done and no capital lost.
Figure 12.2 is a daily chart of the Semiconductor HOLDR (SMH) from July
to October 2007. At the beginning of the month, the consolidation just below the
high of the range at the $37.60 area, as well as the support of the uptrend line from
the August low, were promising. The combination made for good odds of an upside
breakout. However, the action on October 3 and the following days was a clear exam-
ple of how the market always does what it wants to do, not what you want it to do.
This is why you must be patient and wait for exact trigger prices that an ETF must
fi rst exceed before you enter any position. Doing so forces the trade to confi rm its own
strength, rather than your simply assuming it. In the case of SMH, the trigger price for
long entry was 10 cents above the high of the consolidation, but it gapped down on
the October 3 open, never trading above its opening high. Had I prematurely bought
SMH, I would have been immediately faced with a loss. Instead, patience and disci-
pline to wait for predetermined trigger prices prevented any harm from being done.
Trade What You See, Not What You Think
Time and time again, technical analysis points to the likelihood of a trend developing
in a particular direction, when in fact the market moves the opposite way. Does this
mean that technical analysis does not work and you should throw it out the window?

Of course not! Technical analysis does work very well and always has. But you have to
remember that the goal of using technical analysis in your trading is simply to put the
long-term odds and probability for success in your favor.
This means that while a majority of your trades may be profi table over the long
term, you never know whether the next individual trade you enter is going to be a
winner. That’s why you need a solid risk-management plan for exiting trades when
they’re wrong (see Chapter 8). You simply cannot be a profi table trader if you rely on
technical analysis alone and do not also have a solid plan for micromanaging each and
every trade entered.
Profi table traders never worry about whether each individual trade makes money;
rather, they simply focus on putting the long-term odds for success in their favor
through the combination of thorough technical analysis and solid risk management.
The stock market is always right and will ultimately do what it wants to. That’s why
my motto has always been trade what you see, not what you think!
Know When to Be in SOH Mode
SOH is an acronym for “sitting on hands.” The term is reserved for periods during
which a trader detects only minimal trading opportunities with a positive risk/reward
ratio and so does nothing.
The most consistently profi table professional traders are actually out of the mar-
kets more than they are in the markets. They, of course, are very aggressive when times
are good, loading up on promising trade setups, but they step aside when the picture
is not so clear.
Some of the various scenarios in which one should consider SOH mode include
the following:
• Strong divergence between the trends of the major indexes. If the S&P 500
is breaking down below support of a long-term uptrend line while at the same
time the Nasdaq Composite breaks out to a 52-week high, this is clear divergence
between the major indexes. In these situations, you will typically fi nd the broad
market choppy and indecisive due to the tug-of-war taking place. It’s best to let the
market participants fi ght it out and observe from the sidelines.
• High percentage of breakouts are failing. When leading stocks and ETFs are
breaking out of sound bases of consolidation, but falling below the pivot a day or
two later, this is a sign of an unsure market. Attempting to buy breakouts in such an
environment is an invitation to churning your account.
• Light total volume levels in the market. When overall turnover is coming in well
below 50-day average levels, trends that attempt to develop in the major indexes will
often be short-lived. With a minimal number of market participants, a lot of pressure
in the opposite direction will easily cause a trend to fail. With a lack of follow-through
on both the long and short side of the market, SOH is the best plan of action.
• Highly anticipated news is on tap. If Wall Street is expecting signifi cant mar-
ket-moving news such as a Fed decision on economic policy, or perhaps the

announcement of major geopolitical news, it’s best to be in SOH mode until seeing
the stock market’s reaction. Remember it’s not the actual news that matters, but
merely the reaction to the news.
• When you need to listen to your intuition. Once in a great while, I will get a
hunch that something just “doesn’t feel right” in the market. I’ve generally regretted
ignoring such hunches because the intuitions turned out to be correct. What might
seem like merely a hunch is actually the sum of years of experience in seeing past
situations of a similar nature. Listen to your subconscious on such occasions.
Don’t Necessarily Avoid High-Priced ETFs
When I fi rst began trading individual stocks, I mistakenly focused on trading only the
inexpensive stocks (ETFs were limited at the time). Though I didn’t trade penny stocks,
the issues I traded were typically priced anywhere from $3 to $20 per share. My rationale
was that I would be able to afford to buy more shares and therefore have greater poten-
tial for profi t. At the time, my reasoning seemed logical, and I even made some gains
by trading those low-priced issues. Nevertheless, I failed to realize one crucial point:
There was just as much profi t to be made by trading higher-priced stocks because the
higher-priced stocks also move proportionately more on a point basis at any given time.
Therefore, I could make as much profi t buying fewer shares of an expensive stock, as
opposed to more shares of a less expensive stock. Consider the following examples:
Example 1: You decide to buy 2,000 shares of an ETF that is priced at just $15 per share.
Excluding commission, it would cost you $30,000. If that ETF moves up 4 percent
in value, your gain would be 60 cents per share, making the new price of the ETF
$15.60. Two thousand shares times $15.60 per share now gives you a total value of
$31,200. This equals a net gain of $1,200 on a capital investment of $30,000.
Example 2: You buy a higher-priced ETF, but since you are limited to $30,000 in
capital, you can buy only a limited number of shares. The ETF you want to buy
costs $150 per share. Therefore, you buy 200 shares of this stock. The ETF subse-
quently moves up 4 percent in value (same as the previous example). A 4 percent
appreciation gives you a net gain of $6 per share, which now prices the ETF at
$156 per share. Two hundred shares times $156 per share gives a total value of
$31,200. Therefore, your overall net profi t is $1,200 on capital of $30,000.
As you can see, when an ETF moves up or down by any given percentage, your
profi t potential is not affected by the number of shares owned. A 4 percent gain is the
same profi t whether the ETF is inexpensive or expensive.
Expensive ETFs move proportionately more points than lower-priced issues,
but when you look at the gains in terms of percentages, the end results are the same.
Obviously, there is nothing wrong with buying ETFs that are inexpensive and meet all
the other criteria, but just make sure not to limit yourself. The bottom line is the same.

==================================================

Additional Pointers 183
Just a reminder: Higher-priced ETFs and stocks are expensive for a reason. They
are the leaders, and institutions are buying them. Always buy the leaders, not the
laggards.
Support and Resistance at the Whole Numbers
Although ETFs are synthetic instruments driven by the demand of the underlying
stocks, their prices often probe just above or below whole numbers before reversing.
This occurs because the specialist is trying to make a larger profi t by widening the bid/
ask spreads at key levels of support and resistance.
The advent of electronic communications networks (ECNs; discussed in Chapter
11) has helped reduce the frequency of this occurring, but it’s still a factor to be con-
cerned about. One of the more interesting patterns I have observed when trading
stocks is how often the specialists and market makers seem to use the nearest whole
number as a resistance or support level for a stock’s price.
For example, if an uptrending ETF is trading at 58.93, it will usually trade up
to 59.00 (or a few cents beyond 59.00), but will then pull back just below the whole
number before making its next move up past the 59.00 price. The opposite is true of
ETFs that are selling off. If an ETF is trading at 64.06, it will usually drop down to the
nearest whole number (64), but will then bounce back up above the whole number
briefl y before dropping any further below 64. For this reason, both buy triggers and
protective stops should not be set exactly at whole numbers.
This phenomenon is kind of odd because, in theory, it doesn’t matter whether an
ETF is bought at 58.93 or 59.00; nonetheless, ETFs will usually act strangely as they
approach a whole number. This is likely due to the fact that retail investors generally use
whole numbers for setting their buy and sell orders because this practice is “clean-cut.”
Unfortunately, specialists can take advantage of seeing all these stop orders, often leaving
the investors holding the bag (remember “stop hunts,” discussed throughout this book).
But since you already know these things, you can use this knowledge for your benefi t.
The easiest way to manage this situation is to always try to buy just below the
whole number and sell just above the whole number. Although not following this
rule will not be detrimental, you will consistently make a higher profi t if you show
patience by waiting for the right time to buy and sell based on whole numbers.
A fi nal trick is to use whole numbers to calculate exact exit points in order to have
the highest chance of getting your order fi lled. For example, if you are long an ETF that
is trading at 48.77 and you want to sell it, you would set the sell limit order around
48.98, as opposed to 49.00. By doing so, you are more likely to get the order fi lled
because you are trying to sell ahead of the crowd, just below the whole number. The
odds of getting the sell fi lled at 48.98 are much greater than the odds of getting it fi lled
at 49.00. The opposite applies if trying to cover a short position or buy a new long entry.
If an ETF is at 95.36 and you want to cover the short position, you would place the buy
limit around 95.05, as opposed to below the whole number (like 94.95). Again, this
increases the odds of getting the order fi lled.

==================================================

184 Fine-Tuning Your Strategy
Always Use Reward/Risk Ratios
Want a really easy way to minimize your risk when trading ETFs? Then be sure you
thoroughly understand the reward/risk ratio concept—it will both minimize your
risks and maximize your profi ts.
The reward/risk ratio of any trade enables the trader to compare the potential
upside profi t, if the trade moves in the anticipated direction, with the potential risk
of capital loss, if it’s stopped out. If the downside risk outweighs the profi t potential,
don’t make the trade. If the opposite is true, then proceed with your planned trade,
especially if the reward is at least double the risk (2:1 reward/risk ratio). When trading
ETFs, you must be constantly aware of this dynamic.
Here is an example of how you might weigh the reward/risk ratio of a swing trade.
Say you are holding an ETF that has already rallied many points in the course of just a
few days, and say that the ETF has already risen more than 20 percent, from $70 per
share to $85 per share, during the course of just three trading days. If you decide to buy
this ETF at a price of $85, how would you say the potential reward compares to the
downside risk of a correction in the short term? Generally speaking, the downside risk
is much greater than the upside potential because the ETF is more likely to come down
several percent than it is to go up several more percent, at least in the short term. You
would be risking at least several percent on the downside in an attempt to gain a mere
couple of extra percent on the upside. This is why you don’t want to buy ETFs that are
too far extended away from their breakout levels.
If, however, you entered this ETF at a price of $73, just after it broke out above
resistance at $70, the reward/risk ratio would be much more favorable because the ETF
would have been only $3 beyond its pivot and would likely have much more upside
potential.
Here is another illustration of reward/risk. Suppose you are considering buying
an ETF that broke out to a 52-week high about a week ago and has had fi ve consecu-
tive days of gains since then. Therefore, it is sitting at its new 52-week high, rather
than consolidating in a sideways range. Also, in a slightly different scenario, you are
considering buying an ETF that has already broken out to a 52-week high, eating up
all overhead supply, but is now consolidating in a tight, sideways range. In the short
term, all other factors being equal, which one of these two trades do you think would
have the better reward/risk ratio? If you chose the second example, you are correct.
In the fi rst scenario, it is extremely likely that the ETF would be due for some
profi t taking and would quickly retrace a bit of its gain. If you bought that ETF at an
extended level, you would be risking the possibility of losing a signifi cant amount of
money, or else being forced to hold through a potentially deep pullback. The upside
profi t potential would also be more limited in the near term because the ETF would
have already made a signifi cant gain.
In the second scenario, the reward/risk ratio is much better, because your down-
side is not as great as in the fi rst example. But, more important, your upside profi t
potential is much greater. Remember that once this ETF breaks out above its con-
solidation, it is likely to keep going several points higher before turning back around.

==================================================

Additional Pointers 185
Therefore, in this second scenario, although there is still downside risk, the upside
potential is much greater.
Understanding the reward/risk ratio concept is crucial because it enables you to
decide which trades have the least risk and the most profi t potential. This especially
comes in handy if you fi nd several ETFs that all appear to have good technical chart
patterns for entry, but you are nearing the maximum exposure of your capital account.
Your decision can be based upon entering the ETF with the best reward/risk ratio. If one
ETF has upside potential of $5 per share, but appears to have a minimal downside risk
of $1 or so (based on the fact that the ETF is trading near a technical support level), then
that ETF would be a better trade to enter than the one in which you are risking $7 to
$10 on the downside in an attempt to gain a mere $2 per share of profi t on the upside.
The risk value to use in the overall reward/risk calculation is always the number of
points from the entry price to your intended stop. The reward is the number of points
from your entry to the projected target price.
After-Hours Trading Activity
If you are new to trading ETFs, be aware of subtle variations between investing in
them and in individual stocks. One difference is that the trading sessions of many
ETFs conclude at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time (ET), 15 minutes after the close of the regu-
lar session, but at the same time that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures wrap up
their regular session. Stocks, of course, register their fi nal closing prices at 4:00 p.m.
Most of the time, this doesn’t make a big difference either way. Nonetheless, the futures
markets sometimes make large moves in that 15-minute window. On June 26, 2007,
was one such occurrence, which is illustrated on the 5-minute intraday chart of the
S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) in Figure 12.3.
As you can see, SPY moved 72 cents lower between the regular close of 4:00 p.m.
and its offi cial closing time of 4:15 p.m. Its 4:00 p.m. closing price was 149.06, but
its “offi cial” session closing price was 148.34. This was due to an end-of-day wave of
selling in the futures markets that, as you might have guessed, pushed the S&P 500
futures below pivotal support of its June low. This is important to know because many
brokers allow their mechanical stop orders to work until 4:15 p.m. instead of 4:00 p.m.
If you don’t want your stops to get prematurely triggered by after-hours trading,
remember this unique situation.
Price Divergence Due to Dividend Distributions
Another subtlety to remember about ETFs is that they pay regular dividend distribu-
tions, just like stocks. Depending on the underlying composition of the ETFs, how-
ever, their distributions can sometimes be much larger than those of individual stocks.
This is especially true of the fi xed-income (bond) ETFs, most of which pay regular
dividends on the fi rst of every month.

Though their daily charts may sometimes show a lack of price volatility, remember
that the prices of all ETFs are adjusted lower by the amount of the dividend payout.
Therefore, if an ETF gained 2 points over the course of a few weeks but paid a dividend
distribution of nearly $1 per share, the actual gain on the chart will look like only 1 point,
but the total gain in your pocket is 2 points. Half of that will be in the price appreciation of
the ETF and the rest in the form of a dividend distribution. Figure 12.4 is an example
of such an ETF, the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund (LQD),
which I took a two-month position in from August through October 2007. Notice that
the price doesn’t appear to have gained much in the period that is circled on the chart,
but LQD would actually be trading above the high of its consolidation and 200-day MA
if not for two separate dividend payouts that totaled approximately 1 point.
On September 4, LQD distributed 49 cents per share (A). On October 1, it paid
out 48 cents per share (B). Both times, the price of the ETF was automatically adjusted
lower by the amount of the dividend; just the same as occurs when individual stocks
trade ex-dividend (the amount of the dividend has been deducted from the current
market price of the stock after the dividend has been paid). In addition to the fi xed-
income ETFs, note that the ProShares family of inversely correlated and leveraged
ETFs also make rather large dividend distributions, largely due to the fact that they are
leveraged.
Because ETFs are derivatives, they will always trade in lockstep with the daily
price action of their underlying components. In the case of broad-based ETFs that
track indexes such as the S&P 500, the Dow, or the Nasdaq Composite, they move
up or down by approximately the same percentage as their corresponding indexes.
But occasionally you might fi nd a substantial price discrepancy between the index and
the ETF. If so, don’t worry. It’s not an error in the computerized algorithm. Rather, the

most likely explanation is that your ETF had a dividend distribution on that date.
Such was the case on June 26, with my long position in the UltraShort S&P500
ProShares (SDS).
At the open, the inversely correlated SDS was instantly showing a loss of just over
1 percent from the previous day’s close (about 60 cents per share). Yet, the S&P 500
opened the day only fractionally higher. The reason for the difference was simply that
SDS paid out a dividend of $0.43 per share that day. When stocks and ETFs trade
ex-dividend, they automatically gap down by the amount of the dividend distribution
that day, not factoring in any normal changes in supply or demand. The actual divi-
dends subsequently show up as a cash deposit in your trading account.
In the case of SDS, the dividend of $0.43 per share was paid to shareholders on
July 2. If you add 46 cents to the June 26 closing price of SDS, you get the actual
price it would have closed at on that day if there had not been a dividend distribution.
Whenever an ETF has a distribution, you automatically adjust your original stop and
target prices lower by the amount of the dividend payout.
Withstanding Stop Hunts
When trading stocks or ETFs with an expected holding time of one to three weeks,
use the 60-minute or 120-minute chart interval for setting stops, as it allows you to
overlook the “noise” associated with charts of a shorter time interval. Specifi cally, simply
draw a trendline connecting the lows (for an uptrend) or highs (for a downtrend) over a
period of weeks. You can then trail a stop just below or above support of the trendline.
On the surface, this is a basic technical analysis concept that you may already know, but

the important detail that most traders miss is the wiggle room required to withstand the
inevitable stop hunts below the trendline.
One of the biggest problems I had as a novice trader was being stopped out of
a stock, only to watch it reverse in the right direction only pennies below my stop.
Eventually, I fi gured out why. The problem was that I was placing my stops at the same
level as all the other traders’ stops. My stop was too obvious. Because specialists and
market makers know where most stops are residing, they make sure that every test of
trendline support results in a quick probe below those stops. Then, they can accumulate
shares of the stock before continuing the primary trend. After years of frustration from
losing money in this manner, I learned to give my stops enough wiggle room below the
obvious trendline support where all the other traders had placed their stops. I now know
my stops are in the right place when the position I am in reverses just before hitting my
stop. This is exactly what happened in OIH on October 31, 2006. See Figure 12.5.
I originally bought OIH as it broke out above the 50-day MA on October 19 (A).
At the time of entry, I used new support of the 20-day EMA as the basis for setting
my original stop of $126.58. That protective stop was equivalent to nearly one point
below the 20-day EMA, giving enough wiggle room to withstand a stop hunt. On
October 26, after OIH had rallied to an unrealized gain of 6 points, I trailed the stop
up to the break-even point ($131.65), to remove all the risk from the trade. My mis-
take in doing so, however, was that I initially failed to realize that a break-even stop of
$131.65 coincided exactly with support of the hourly uptrend line that had formed.
Each of the circled areas indicate anchor points of that trendline. So, on October 30,
I quickly corrected the problem by adjusting the stop a bit lower, down to $130.30.

Again, this was done to give OIH a bit of wiggle room below support of the primary
uptrend line. OIH dipped below trendline support on October 31, but not enough
to hit the adjusted stop of $130.30. Later that afternoon, OIH rallied sharply, closing
at its intraday high and back above support of its uptrend line. Such probes below key
support levels are common on an intraday basis, but the closing price is more relevant.
Changing a protective stop on a long position is not a good habit to establish, but
it’s something that is necessary a few times per year. When I realize I have made a mis-
take by placing too tight of a stop, I have no problem with giving the ETF a little more
wiggle room that a slightly looser stop affords, just as long as the maximum capital risk
per trade is not violated. Because I had already raised the stop up to breakeven, lower-
ing it slightly below that level meant that my maximum capital risk was still minimal
if I stopped out. If you’re a trend trader, an easy rule of thumb in setting stops is to
ask yourself, “Is my stop placement too obvious?” If it is, you can be assured that you
will be stopped out, only to watch the stock or ETF reverse in the right direction. It’s
always better to have smaller share size and the proper stop than to try to hit a home
run with large share size, which requires a really tight stop.
Another example of how to withstand stop hunts occurred on June 20, 2007, when
my long setup in the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (QQQQ) missed my trigger
price by 10 cents. Though I was prepared to buy the breakout to a new high, I followed
the rule of giving all stocks and ETFs a bit of wiggle room beyond key support and
resistance levels. Specialists and market makers know that amateur investors often place
stop orders right at the most obvious support and resistance levels. As such, the huge
leverage of specialists and market makers enables them to move the market just enough
to run those stops and scoop up shares at the best prices. In this case, QQQQ probed
just 5 cents above its 3-day range, enabling market makers to trigger the buy stop orders
and sell their shares at the highs before reversing sharply lower (Figure 12.6).
Going into the open of June 20, the 3-day high of QQQQ was 47.87 (the hori-
zontal line). Because QQQQ had an average true range (ATR) of about 50 cents,
I needed to allow for at least 10 cents of wiggle room for buy stops above resistance and
sell stops below support. That meant my minimum trigger price for entry was 47.97.
When a trigger price is so close to a whole number, I move the stop to just above it
because many investors simply use whole numbers as their stop prices. Therefore, my
trigger price for entry was 48.02. If QQQQ had rallied enough to hit that price, the
rally would have had a better chance of sticking. But since it missed the trigger price,
there was no harm done. It’s always better to pay a slightly higher price for entry, in
exchange for a better chance of not getting sucked into a false breakout.
Closing Thoughts
Most likely, the strategies you’ve learned here already make sense to you in theory, but
understand that it requires real-life application of the strategies for you to truly benefi t.
Learning the subtleties of detecting relative strength on charts, analyzing volume, and
perfecting your entry and exit points with precision takes years of experience.

Don’t be a trader who seeks the holy grail of trading, the one small tip or indicator
that will make you rich overnight. Simply put, there is no better teacher than diving
in and getting experience with a concept and learning with real capital. I’m not afraid
to say that I lost a substantial amount of money (to me anyway) in the beginning
years of my trading career. But it was through those formative years that I very quickly
learned what works and what doesn’t work. In my mind, it was not lost capital, but
rather “traders’ tuition.”
I learned the strategies in this book primarily through a lot of trial and error.
Fortunately, your learning curve will be dramatically shortened if you simply put into
action the concepts explained here. There’s a lot to digest in fully understanding and
appreciating the top-down strategy, so be sure to review this book frequently. To fully
benefi t from it, consider this a professional reference, not a novel you read once.

Trading ETFs: Gaining an Edge with Technical Analysis, Second Edition
by Deron Wagner

Afterword
When I began trading at age 24, I was completely and utterly clueless about the stock
market. At the time, I was managing a successful wholesale business but had no previ-
ous experience in the fi nancial world. Nor did I even study fi nance at my university.
But now, more than 10 years later, I’m proud to say my consistently profi table trading
track record enables me to earn a rather comfortable livelihood. I say this not to infl ate
my ego but to make the signifi cant point that I’m frankly nobody special. Through
lots of trial and error, sheer determination, and incredible persistence to fi ght my way
back from losses, I eventually fi gured out how to profi t from ETF trading. I will share
some personal thoughts that can help you achieve the same results.
Every successful trader I know has lost a lot of money in the market at one time or
another. If they say they haven’t, chances are they’re either lying or brand-new to the
trading business. Realize that a certain level of risk is required in order to profi t from
the stock market. Without taking a certain degree of controlled risk, it’s impossible to
earn a single dollar of profi t. Taking risk, however, also means occasionally incurring
substantial losses. You must accept that losing trades are a completely normal, inevi-
table part of the business, and you simply can’t be afraid to suffer losses at times. The
trick is to determine the exact dollar amount of capital you’re willing to risk on each
and every trade and then maintain the discipline to cut the losses when you reach your
protective stops. Consistent profi tability in the stock market is entirely possible with
just a 50 percent batting average of winning trades—if the average dollar loss of each
trade is less than the average dollar gain of each winning trade.
Because virtually all traders make numerous mistakes in the formative years, it’s
also imperative that you substantially limit the total amount of capital risk you take
until you develop a consistent track record of profi tability. Trading with too heavy of
a position size and trying to hit home runs before you establish long-term profi tability
can easily result in a loss of capital so damaging that it is impossible to recover the
losses. Unfortunately, traders frequently run out of trading capital just as they’re fi nally
turning the corner and starting to “see the light.” If you’re new to the business, don’t
let this happen to you. Making small bets and swinging for just singles and doubles in
the early years will ensure that you can withstand losing periods long enough to enjoy the
fruits of your labor when you eventually become consistently profi table.
When it comes to capital losses, one thing that separates long-term winners from
perennial losers is that winners learn from their mistakes and make every effort not to
repeat them. To ensure that you remember and don’t repeat your mistakes, keep some
type of trading journal to record honest observations in periods of both successful
191

and unsuccessful trading. In your journal, you also want to maintain detailed trad-
ing statistics that will enable you to glean valuable insights. Performance measured is
performance gained. Your journal can be as simple or as fancy as you desire, but the
point is to get one and use it.
I am convinced there is no direct correlation between intelligence and the ability to
become a consistently profi table trader. Over the years, I’ve seen extremely intelligent
doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and even people with MBAs fail miserably at their
trading. What’s the common denominator to all their failures? In my opinion, they all
thought they were smarter than the market. They let their egos and their desire to be
right dominate their trading decisions. They didn’t listen to what the market was tell-
ing them and simply react to it. My mantra, which reminds me to always keep my ego
in check, is, “Trade what you see, not what you think.” I never really care about being
right or wrong in my analysis; I care about making money.
In addition to managing actual capital through the Morpheus Capital hedge
fund, I still enjoy educating traders through my daily ETF and stock newsletters at
morpheustrading.com, which I have been doing since 2002. I also enjoy teaching my
strategy in more detail at dragoncharts.com. Occasionally, people ask me why I bother
taking the time to write a subscription-based newsletter every day if my trading is
profi table enough to generate a steady income. The answer to that question is twofold.
First and foremost, sharing trading lessons I’ve learned over the years with other
people who quest for knowledge brings me great personal satisfaction. On a regu-
lar basis, I receive e-mails from subscribers, thanking me for the knowledge that has
helped them generate profi ts from their trading activities. It sincerely brings a big
smile to my face each time I read one of those and certainly makes all my intensive
writing over the years worth the effort.
The second reason I continue to devote time to educating new and experienced
traders and investors is that the technical analysis required for discussing what’s hap-
pening in the market forces me to stay focused on my actual trading. The separate
activities of researching leading ETF picks for the newsletter and managing my trad-
ing accounts are fully complementary to each other. Further, since ETFs are synthetic
instruments that automatically follow the direction of their underlying indexes, the
prices of ETFs discussed in my newsletter will never be affected directly by the buy-
ing and selling of my newsletter subscribers. Nor will the strategies contained in my
newsletter and this book stop working in the future merely because too many people
are doing the same thing. That’s just one more benefi t of trading ETFs over individual
stocks, although we actually trade both in our hedge fund.

Suggested Reading
Although I believe there is no better teacher than trial and error when dealing with
real capital, an enormous number of books and web sites can signifi cantly reduce the
amount of time required to become a successful trader. Unfortunately, there is so much
material available that trying to determine the most valuable sources of information
can be an overwhelming task. To assist you, I would like to share the names of a few
books that have been major sources of inspiration to me and to my trading career.
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, written by Edwin Lefèvre in 1923, is a classic that
tells the fi ctionalized story of Jesse Livermore, perhaps the fi rst person to fi gure out a
real system for trading the stock market. Even though the book is nearly 90 years old,
its concepts are timeless because the human emotions of fear and greed that drive the
stock market haven’t changed. This book is a must-read, regardless of whether you are
speculating on a part-time or full-time basis.
Another classic, written in 1960, is How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market
by Nicolas Darvas. This book tells the true story of how a professional dancer devel-
oped a very simple, yet incredibly effi cient, system of technical analysis that enabled
him to earn more than $2 million in a span of just 18 months. Because it was written
in 1960, that’s a whole lot more than $2 million in today’s equivalent money. This
book served as the foundation for my current style of trailing stops on winning trades,
although my trading time horizon is much shorter than his.
How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad by
William J. O’Neil, the founder of Investor’s Business Daily, is the third on my must-
read list of trading books. I suggest reading How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock
Market before this book, as the basic concepts in How to Make Money in Stocks
were derived from Darvas’ book. O’Neil, however, took the basic strategy and greatly
refi ned it, creating his well-known CAN SLIM® system, which works like a charm in
practically all market conditions.
If you read no other trading-related material, you should at least read the three books
listed above. Doing so will provide you with an incredible source of inspiration, motiva-
tion, and sound principles to set you on the right path. Even though they talk about
individual stocks instead of ETFs, the strategies can be applied to ETF trading as well.
Finally, may I humbly suggest that you check out The Long-Term Daytrader, a book
I coauthored in 2000. Although it was created during the height of the day-trading,
dot-com mania, the book is written in a practical, no-hype format. My sector trading
strategy for individual stocks is the focal point of the book, whereas the refi nements of
my strategy over the years are the source of this book on ETF trading.

In addition to my books, an entire ten-year archive of every issue of my Wagner
Daily ETF newsletter can be viewed for free on the morpheustrading.com web site.
If you really want to master the strategies taught in this book, I strongly recommend
spending a little time each day reading past issues of my daily newsletter. Although
the actual trade setups were relevant only at the time of publication, their educational
value remains high because thorough, technical explanations for my trade selection are
presented in a concise, user-friendly fashion. A complimentary one-month trial to The
Wagner Daily is also available on the web site, as are several other trading newsletters
published by Morpheus Trading Group. Also, to more completely learn my trading
strategy and benefi t from my exclusive, web-based stock screener, please visit dragon-

I hope you have enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed writing it. If you have any
questions about the strategy, feel free to drop me a line at deron@morpheustrading.com.
I’ll make every effort to answer your e-mail as quickly as possible, but please be patient
waiting for a reply because I often receive a massive amount of subscriber e-mail. I truly
wish you all the best in your trading endeavors. Thanks for reading this book.
