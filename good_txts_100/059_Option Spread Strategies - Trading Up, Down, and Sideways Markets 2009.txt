Introduction
The fact that listed option trading volumes are exploding is not news.
As of May 1, 2008, volume is up approximately 41 percent over 2007,
which was also a record year. Option volumes have grown at a rate
of approximately 30 percent per year for the last four years, and have more
than tripled since 2000.
The forces driving option growth are much larger than recent market
volatility and the need to hedge risk—after all, much of the double-digit
growth took place during the low-volatility years of 2003 through early
2007. Several forces have combined to give the individual investor greater
access to the options markets and to help level the playing field for the
individ ual and the professional options traders:
Technology—All exchanges are now fully or partially electronic. This
has opened up access to the individual options trader, as brokers now sup-
ply front-end systems that offer direct connections to every exchange and
tools to help analyze, execute, and manage position risk.
Commissions—Commission rates continue to plummet as brokers lev-
erage technology and compete for business.
Number of viable exchanges—The number of options exchanges con-
tinues to defy predictions and grow. With the recent addition of the Nas-
daq Options Market (NOM), the number has now reached seven. These
exchanges are in competition for the business of individual investors, and
fee reductions and other incentives are the result.
Educational resources—The number of entities dedicated to options
education and training continues to increase, along with the number of in-
vestors utilizing their services. The exchanges, the Options Industry Coun-
cil, brokers, and other private entities offer robust programs at low cost.
Tighter bid-ask spreads—Although it is having a large negative im-
pact on institutional options traders, the penny pilot program is very ben-
eficial to the smaller individual investor because it has tightened spreads
in many popular names.

xii Introduction
The bigger news in the U.S.-listed options market is the growth in the
electronic trading of spreads. Behind the scenes the volume of trading of
complex option structures has outpaced overall growth in options trading.
This book is dedicated to the art (and science) of spread trading. A number
of factors have contributed to the explosion in spread trading:
Electronic spread books—Currently the Chicago Board Options Ex-
change (CBOE) and the International Securities Exchange (ISE) offer elect ronic
spread books (the Philadelphia Stock Exchange [PHLX] is not far behind).
These electronic “complex order books” allow traders the potential to elec-
tronically enter and trade multileg spread orders of various strategies—all of
which are covered in this book—without the risk of being “legged” (missing
one side of the spread). Spreads also can be traded in penny increments even
if their underlying options cannot.
Ease of entry and exit—These same electronic spread books are ac-
cessible through the same front-end systems offered by most brokers. (If a
broker doesn’t offer direct access to the spread books, it is time to switch
brokers.)
Portfolio-based margining—In the past, the margining of spreads
sometimes made them economically unrealistic for many investors. The
availability of portfolio-based margining at many brokers has made spread
margining more realistic and affordable for many investors.
Limited-risk strategies—Spreads offer investors different ways to
participate in market scenarios in a limited-risk fashion. Vertical spreads,
butterflies, condors, and time spreads are all limited-risk strategies that the
investor can use to address different market scenarios. (After the recent
subprime meltdown, limiting risk has once again become fashionable.)
Spread trading is the new frontier for the individual options trader, and
this frontier is opening up rapidly. This book is dedicated to spread strate-
gies, both of the limited-risk and unlimited-risk varieties, and to how and
when to use them.

CONCEPT REVIEW
Intrinsic value: The amount by which an option is “in-the-money.”
Extrinsic value: The portion of an option price that cannot be
attributed to intrinsic value.
Implied volatility: The volatility component of an option’s theoreti-
cal pricing model determined by using current prices along with
other known variables. It may be viewed as the market’s forecast
of what the average volatility of the underlying instrument might
be during the time remaining before its expiration.
Delta: The sensitivity (rate of change) of an option’s theoretical
value (assessed value) to a $1 move of the underlying instrument.
Gamma: The sensitivity (rate of change) of an option’s delta with
respect to a $1 change in the price of the underlying instrument.
Theta: The sensitivity (rate of change) of theoretical option prices
to the passage of small periods of time. Theta measures the rate
of decay in the time value of options. Theta may be expressed as
the amount of erosion of an option’s theoretical value over one
day in time.
Vega: The sensitivity (rate of change) of an option’s theoretical
value to a change in implied volatility. Vega may be expressed as
the number of points of theoretical value gained or lost from a
1-percent rise or fall in implied volatility.

Synthetic:Two or more trading vehicles (for example, call, put, and
underlying) packaged together to emulate another trading vehicle
or spread. Some examples:
(long call (cid:2) long put (cid:3) long underlying) (short call (cid:2) short put
(cid:3) short underlying)
(long put (cid:2) long call (cid:3) short underlying) (short put (cid:2) short call
(cid:3) long underlying)
(long underlying (cid:2) long call (cid:3) short put) (short underlying
(cid:2) short call (cid:3) long put)
Conversion: A position that consists of a long underlying, a short
call, and a long put with the same strike price, which is considered
a market neutral position.
Vertical spread: The simultaneous purchase and sale of options of
the same class and with the same expiration times but with differ-
ent strike prices. Depending on which strike is bought and which
strike is sold, vertical spreads can be either bullish or bearish. For
example, with XYZ July 100/105 call vertical spread, a bullish t rader
would buy the 100 call and sell the 105 call, whereas a bearish
trader would buy the 105 call and sell the 100 call.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
A covered-write is a strategy that combines a long stock position and
a short call (Figure 1.1). In options parlance a written option is an option
that is sold, in this case a call, and a short call is covered by a long stock

Strategy Composition 5
position, hence the name covered-write. The calls are sold in equal amounts
against the long underlying shares. In the United States, the contract size
of a stock option is usually 100 shares; therefore, one call would be sold
against 100 shares, five calls against 500 shares, and so on. The strike price
and expiration date of the call(s) chosen can vary depending on the invest-
ment objective, market view, and risk appetite of the investor, as well as
the pricing of the calls themselves.
STRATEGY COMPOSITION
Components: Sell one 45 call at $2.25
Purchase 100 shares of XYZ stock at $45.00
Maximum Profit: Limited to the premium received for the sale of the call,
plus any increase in value of the underlying up to the
strike price of the short call ($2.25)
Maximum Loss: Substantial loss on the downside for the long underlying
position (limited by zero), less the premium received
for the sale of the call
Breakeven: Price paid for the underlying minus the premium
received for the sale of the call ($42.75)
The writing of a call against a long stock position serves twopurposes:
It generates potential income and provides some downside protection.
However, in return, the investor gives away any upside price appreciation
in the stock above the strike price.
• Income Generation
The price of an option has two components, intrinsic value and extrins ic
value. Intrinsic value is the amount, if any, that the option is “in the money.”
A call option is in-the-money if the stock price is higher than the strike price.
Any remaining value is extrinsic value. Extrinsic value is the additional pre-
mium carried by an option based on many factors including, but not lim-
ited to, interest rate levels, dividend flows, time to expiration, and implied
volatility levels. The extrinsic value of an option declines as time passes,
and upon expiration it is gone entirely. This phenomenon is known as time
decay (see Figure 1.2). Sellers of options benefit from time decay (which is
referred to as the Greek “theta”) as the extrinsic value in an option declines
over time. This provides income for the investor in a covered-write strategy,
as over time the extrinsic value of the written (sold) call will decline.
• Downside Protection
Writing a call also offers some downside protection for the long stock
position, as the premium(s) collected from selling the call can partially

offset a decline in the stock price. However, this protection is only equal
to the amount of the premium collected when the call was written. Once
the magnitude of the stock decline exceeds the premium collected, the
protection ends.
• Upside Limitations
A covered-write is a neutral to mildly bullish strategy. The reason it
is only a mildly bullish strategy is that the profit potential of the position
to the upside is limited by the short call. If the stock price rises above the
strike price, the short call becomes in-the-money and begins to accumu-
late intrinsic value as the stock price rises, eventually offsetting any gains
in the stock with losses in the short call. Also, if the stock rises above the
strike price and the investor takes no action, it is likely for the stock to be
“called away” by the owner of the call. This may have unpleasant tax con-
sequences that should be considered.
Modifications
In the event that the underlying stock falls too far, or rises too high,
modifications to the position will have to be made to either limit risk, as in
the case of the former, or extend the range of profitability, as in the case of
the latter. We will discuss modifications later in the chapter. These modifi-
cations may increase execution costs, affecting profitability.
RISK MANAGEMENT: THE GREEKS
OF THE COVERED-WRITE
The “Greeks” are metrics used to quantify the sensitivity of option
prices to changes in underlying market conditions. They can be effective
risk management tools and are especially helpful for understanding and
managing the risk of positions. They can also be applied to positions
that are combinations of options and underlying positions, such as a



==================================================
                     PAGE 16                      
==================================================

The Greeks 7
covered-write. To evaluate the sensitivity of a position to changing mar-
ket conditions, the Greeks of the various components of the position are
simply summed, giving an aggregate exposure for the position. It must
be understood, however, that as market conditions change, the Greeks
themselves also change, so the Greeks of any position are in a constant
state of flux.
Basic pricing models calculate the theoretical price of an option based
on six inputs used to describe market conditions:
• Underlying price
• Strike price
• Time to expiration
• Interest rates
• Dividends (if any)
• Implied volatility
Since a covered-write position is part option and part stock, it is the
Greeks of the option component of the position that will change; the Greeks
of the stock component of the position will remain constant. A brief review
of the basic Greeks follows, to help the reader understand how a covered-
write position behaves as market conditions change.
THE GREEKS
Delta
Delta describes the sensitivity (rate of change) of an option’s price
with respect to changes in the underlying price. Expressed as a percent-
age, it represents an equivalent amount of the underlying at a given
moment in time. Calls are assigned a positive delta (call option prices
are positively correlated with the underlying price); puts are assigned
a negative delta (put option prices are negatively correlated with the
underlying price). The delta of a call option can range between 0.00
(0 percent) and 1.00 (100 percent), while the delta of a put option can range
between 0.00 (0 percent) and (cid:4) 1.00 ((cid:4) 100 percent). (See Figures 1.3 and
1.4.) A short position in any of the above call or put options reverses the
delta; for example, a short call will have a negative delta and a short put
will have a positive delta.
Examples
By what amount can one expect the price of a call with a delta of 0.50
(50 percent) to change if the stock price rises by 1.00?
(cid:5) (cid:2)
1.00 0.50 0.50

(cid:3) (cid:4)
is a delta of 100, and short 100 shares is a delta of 100.

The Greeks 9
• Delta of a Covered-Write
The delta of a covered-write position is simply the sum of the deltas of
the components.
Example
What is the delta of a covered-write consisting of 100 shares of long
stock and short 1 call with a .50 delta?
(cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2)
100 (100 .50) 100 ( 50) 50 shares
Note that the delta of the call is reversed because it is a short call.
Gamma
The delta of an option does not remain constant because it is sensitive
to changes in market conditions, one of these being changes in underlying
price. Gamma describes the sensitivity (rate of change) of an option’s delta
with respect to changes in the underlying price. The convention is to express
gamma in terms of the change in delta produced by a one-point move in
the underlying. For example, if the delta of a 100 call changed from 0.50 to
0.60 as the underlying moved from 100.00 to 101.00, the call would be said
to have a gamma of .10 because the delta changed by .10 as the underlying
price rose. If the underlying price declined from 100.00 to 99.00, the delta of
the call would fall from 0.50 to 0.40. This would have an impact on the delta
of a covered-write position because as the underlying price changed, the del-
ta of the short call would change, affecting the delta of the overall position.
Example
An investor has a covered-write position consisting of 100 shares of
long stock and short one .50 delta call. The call has a gamma of .10. What is
the delta of the overall position if:
The stock rises 1.00 . . .
(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:3)
100 (100 (0.50 0.10)) 40 shares
The stock falls 1.00 . . .
(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:2)(cid:3)
100 (100 (0.50 0.10)) 60 shares
Note that the gamma simply increases or decreases the delta of the
option as the underlying price changes; it does not change whether the
delta is positive or negative.
The gamma of an option is not linear and is also sensitive to market
conditions. It is highly dependent on the location of the strike price rela-
tive to the underlying price (sometimes called moneyness) and the time left
until expiration. Figure 1.5 shows the relationship between the gamma of
an option, moneyness, and time until expiration.

Figure 1.5 Gamma vs. Strike
Gamma is highest when an option is at-the-money, and the rate of
change of gamma itself increases as expiration approaches. For the
covered-write, this means that the delta of the position will change the
most as the underlying crosses the strike of the short call, and that this
e ffect will be greater as time to expiration decreases.
Vega
Vega describes the sensitivity of an option’s theoretical value to a 1 per-
cent change in implied volatility. It is usually expressed as the change in
value that would be gained or lost from a 1 percent rise or fall in implied
volatility. Long option positions have a positive vega, and short option
positions have a negative vega. Because a covered-write has a short call as
its option component, it will always have a negative vega.
Rising implied volatility causes the extrinsic value of options to rise,
and falling implied volatility causes the extrinsic value of options to fall.
Furthermore, longer-dated options are more sensitive to changes in i mplied
volatility, since a rise or fall of implied volatility over a longer period is
extrapolated to a much larger (in the case of rising volatility) or much
smaller (in the case of falling volatility) universe of possible price outcomes
at expiration. This is illustrated in Figure 1.6.
Because a covered-write has a negative vega, rising implied volatility
will cause the value of the structure to fall as the short call component of
the strategy rises in price. Conversely, falling implied volatility will cause
the value of the covered-write to rise, as the short call component of the
strategy falls in price. In addition, the value of a covered-write with a
longer-dated short call component will be more sensitive to fluctuations
in implied volatility than a covered-write with a shorter-dated short call
component.

12 Chapter 1 The Covered-Write
As these examples show, rising implied volatility works against a covered-
write, while falling implied volatility works in favor of a covered-write.
Theta
Theta is used to describe the sensitivity of an option’s theoretical value
to the passage of time. It is usually expressed as the number of points that
are lost from one day’s time decay. Long option positions have a negative
theta, and short option positions have a positive theta. Because a covered-
write has a short call as its option component, it will always have a positive
theta.
As mentioned above in “Strategy Overview,” all options are composed
of intrinsic value and extrinsic value, and as time passes, the extrinsic v alue
begins to decay. At expiration, the extrinsic value is gone, and an option is
either in-the-money and has intrinsic value, or it expires worthless. This
means that, all else being equal, the theoretical value of an option should
fall by some amount every day. However, this amount varies because the
rate at which extrinsic value decays is not linear and is itself dependent on
other market factors, especially time to expiration and moneyness, as can
be seen in Figure 1.7:

Days to Expiry
We can see in the figure that the theta of all long-dated options is low
and is very similar for the 90, 100, and 110 strike calls. As time moves for-
ward toward expiration, time decay begins to accelerate and the theta for
all of the options begins to rise. Then, as expiration approaches, the in- and
out-of-the-money calls (the 90 and 110 strike calls) lose their extrinsic value
early, and their thetas begin to decline. Notice, however, that the theta of
the 100 strike call, which is the at-the-money option, begins to accelerate.
Heading into expiration, when the surrounding in- and out-of-the- money
options no longer have extrinsic value to lose, the decay of the at-the- money
option will continue to accelerate.

Investment Objectives 13
Example
An investor has a covered-write position consisting of 100 shares of
long stock at $100.00 and short one 100 strike call at $5.00. The call has a
theta of 0.02. With the stock unchanged and implied volatility unchanged,
what is the change in value of the overall position if:
Five trading days pass . . .
(cid:4) (cid:5)
The price of the call will change from $5.00 to $4.90 ($5.00 5 0.02), so
the value of the position will change accordingly:
Initial Position Value New Position Value
Stock price $100.00 Stock price $100.00
(cid:4) (cid:4)
Call price $5.00 Call price $4.90
Position value $95.00 Position value $95.10
As this example shows, time decay works in favor of a covered-write.
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
As mentioned earlier in “Strategy Overview,” the covered-write
strategy is a neutral to mildly bullish strategy. The main objectives of a
c overed-write are the generation of income and limited downside protec-
tion. Every covered-write is a mixture of both and, depending on how the
investor structures the trade, that is, which strike price and expiration cycle
are chosen, the trade will be more of one and less of the other. It is also
extremely important to distinguish between the covered-write as a long-term,
systematic strategy, and the covered-write as a short-term trade.
Covered-Write as a Long-Term Strategy
Investors who use the covered-write as a long-term strategy usually have
a core portfolio of stocks that—up or down, better or worse—they will hold.
They systematically write calls against the stocks in the portfolio to help gen-
erate income, and, over time, lower the cost basis of the portfolio. Even though
the written calls provide some downside protection for the portfolio, these in-
vestors are not as sensitive to downside risk because they will be holding the
portfolio regardless of whether the market rises or falls in the short-term.
Covered-Write as a Short-Term Trading Strategy
The investor who uses the covered-write as a short-term trading strat-
egy usually purchases the stock specifically for the purpose of writing
a call against it and creating a strategy. Many times this trade is executed as
a spread on an exchange known as a buy-write. The stock is not part of a long-
term core portfolio, and, therefore, the short-term covered-write investor is

14 Chapter 1 The Covered-Write
usually much more sensitive to downside risk than the long-term covered-
write investor is and requires a stronger, bullish market view.
Rates of Return
Regardless of whether one is a short-term or long-term covered writer,
the best outcome is a slow rise that allows the stock to appreciate in price
while the option slowly decays, and, hopefully, expires worthless. This
allows the investor to capture both the price appreciation in the stock and
the time decay in the option, generating a profit on the overall position. The
exact amount of profit depends on how the covered-write was constructed,
the stock price, the option price, and the strike price. Usually covered-write
strategies are analyzed in terms of rates of return at various points:
• Return to Call
This is the rate of return generated on the position if the stock price is
at the strike price or higher at expiration, a price at which the stock would
be called away by the holder of the written call. The stock price at or higher
than the strike price is the best-case scenario for a covered-write:

• Return to Unchanged
This is the rate of return generated on the position if the stock is
unchanged but is still lower than the strike price at expiration, meaning an
out-of-the-money call was written. This is the rate of return if the written
call expires worthless while the stock remains unchanged:

Return to call and Return to unchanged are variations of the same formula
with the numerator representing the selling price for the stock at the end of
expiration. In the case of Return to call, the numerator is represented by the
strike price, because that is the price an investor would receive for his stock
if it were called. In Return to unchanged it is represented by the current stock
price, because that is the price an investor would receive for his stock if he
wished to sell it in the open market.
Break-Even Point
The break-even point is the point at which the decline in stock price
equals the amount of premium collected on the written call. At this point
all of the protection furnished by the written call is “used up” and the
investor is exposed to losses if the stock continues lower:

STRATEGY COMPONENT SELECTION
So how does one structure a good covered-write strategy? The answer
to this question depends on many of the variables we have discussed in
previous sections:
• What is one’s current market forecast?
— Neutral
— Mildly bullish
— Moderately bullish



==================================================
                     PAGE 25                      
==================================================

16 Chapter 1 The Covered-Write
• What is one’s risk appetite?
— Is covered-writing part of a long-term strategy against a portfolio?
— Is covered-writing part of a short-term trading strategy?
• What is the goal of one’s covered-write?
— Income generation?
— Downside protection?
— Some of each?
• What is the current state of implied volatility in the market?
— High volatility?
— Low volatility?
— What are the potential rates of return?
What Is One’s Current Market Forecast?
As we have mentioned several times, the covered-write is a neutral
to moderately bullish strategy, so, first and foremost, it is mandatory to
have a neutral to moderately bullish outlook on the stock or portfolio one
is considering as a candidate for a covered-write program. An extremely
bullish strategy is inappropriate because the upside is limited, and a bear-
ish approach is also inappropriate because the long stock portion of the
position will lose money, which is only partially offset by the premium
received when writing the call. A sharp or sustained move lower in a stock
or portfolio is disastrous for covered-writes.
Whatever methodology one chooses to use for forecasting market
behavior—fundamental analysis, technical analysis, broker forecasts and
research, or other methods—one should consider a covered-write strat-
egy only if confident in a market forecast of neutral to moderately bull-
ish. Where the forecast falls within that range will help determine strike
selection. It is always desirable to have the stock price greater than or
equal to the strike price at expiration, to achieve maximum returns, so
the strike selected for writing should be where one expects the stock to
be at expiration.
• Neutral to Bullish
With a neutral outlook one is likely forecasting little change in the
under lying price through expiration. In this case, one would want to write
a call that is at-the-money to potentially achieve maximum returns.
• Mildly Bullish
With a mildly bullish outlook, one is most likely forecasting a slight
rise in the underlying price through expiration. In this case, one would
want to write a call that is out-of-the-money in the expected target zone to
potentially achieve maximum returns.

==================================================

Strategy Component Selection 17
• Moderately Bullish
With a moderately bullish outlook, one is likely forecasting a more sub-
stantial rise in the underlying price through expiration. In this case, one
would want to write a call that is further out-of-the-money in the expected
target zone to attempt to achieve maximum returns.
What Is One’s Risk Appetite?
The risk appetite of an investor interested in pursuing a covered-write
strategy is usually determined by the category into which he falls in terms
of time frame. Risk appetite determines strike selection and duration.
The risk in a covered-write is determined by the premium received for
the written call, which provides some downside protection for the stock
position. This premium, in turn, is determined by the location of the strike
price relative to the stock price (moneyness) and the time until expiration
(duration).
• Long-Term (High Risk Appetite)
The long-term covered writer usually has a portfolio of stocks that he
or she has selected to hold. These investors have purchased the stocks in
their portfolios because they like their long-term prospects and because
they intend to hold them no matter what the market chooses to do in the
short-term. They are pursuing a covered-write strategy against the stocks
in their portfolio in order to help generate income and lower the overall
cost basis of the portfolio. They are not particularly interested in the down-
side protection aspect of the covered-write since they are going to hold
their portfolio regardless of what the market might do; therefore, they are
less sensitive to risk.
High Risk Appetite:Investors with high risk appetites can afford to col-
lect less premium for downside protection; this allows them to write calls
that are further out-of-the-money or of shorter duration. Writing calls that
are further out-of-the-money creates a covered-write that has a stronger
bullish stance, allowing for more potential appreciation in the stock price.
Writing calls of shorter duration generates a larger time decay (theta) for
faster income generation.
• Short-Term (Low Risk Appetite)
The short-term covered writer usually enters the position as a trade. In
other words, he has no particular long-term view for the stock that he is
buying; he is more interested in the potential return of the covered-write
itself, and is attracted to situations where high volatility (higher call pre-
miums) are throwing off high potential rates of return. Because, for these
investors, the covered-write is a short-term strategy or trade, they are very
sensitive to risk because a loss in the position cannot be recouped over time
as it might be with a long-term covered-write. Indeed, because short-term
covered writers tend to be more the “trader” type than the “investor” type,

==================================================

18 Chapter 1 The Covered-Write
they tend to keep their trades on a short leash, may only be in the trade a
few days, and will exit at the first sign of trouble.
Low Risk Appetite:The investor with a low risk appetite needs to col-
lect more premium for downside protection; this forces him to write calls
that are at- or even in-the-money or of longer duration. Writing calls that
are at- or in-the-money creates a covered-write that has a defensive stance
of neutral to slightly bearish, and this removes any chance for upside
appreciation in the stock price. Writing calls of longer duration will gener-
ate a smaller time decay (theta), slowing potential income generation.
What Is the Purpose of the Covered-Write?
• Income Generation
Time decay is the key to income generation, and, as we noted in the ear-
lier discussion of theta in “Strategy Composition,” shorter-dated options
have a higher rate of time decay (a larger theta) than longer-dated options,
and at-the-money options have a higher rate of time decay than in- or out-
of-the-money options. This pushes the investor interested in income gen-
eration into the short-dated options. Of course, this has to be balanced with
market view and risk appetite, which require some give and take, but, in
general, covered writers interested in quick income generation need to be
operating in the shorter-dated (forty-five days to expiry and less) options
that are near-the-money. This produces maximum time decay.
• Downside Protection
The investor interested in protecting his portfolio needs to generate
larger premiums when writing calls against his holdings. Calls that are in-
the-money, or of longer duration, generally carry larger premiums. Writing
calls that are in-the-money creates a covered-write that has more of a defen-
sive stance, which offers greater downside protection. However, structuring
a covered-write in this fashion eliminates most if not all of the potential for
upside appreciation in the stock price. In addition, writing calls of longer
duration will result in a smaller time decay (theta), thus slowing income
generation and increasing the holding period for the trade.
What Is the Current State of Implied Volatility
in the Market?
Implied volatility is determined by the current pricing of options in the
marketplace. By using the current option price and an option pricing model,
investors are able to solve for the volatility impliedby the option price. An
option calculator such as the one on the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE) website can make this calculation easier (www.cboe.com).
Implied volatility reflects the consensus opinion of options market
participants about what the expected volatility of the underlying will be
through expiration. High implied volatility means that market participants
are expecting high volatility in the price of the underlying through that



==================================================
                     PAGE 28                      
==================================================

Strategy Component Selection 19
particular expiration cycle. Low implied volatility means that market par-
ticipants are expecting low volatility in the price of the underlying through
that particular expiration cycle. Implied volatility is in a constant state of
flux as new information influences the market and alters the expectations
of the participants. It is a “market” in and of itself.
As we discussed in “Strategy Composition,” when we examined vega,
rising implied volatility causes option prices to rise, while falling implied
volatility causes option prices to fall. This has a direct impact on the
covered-write because it is the premium generated by the sale of the call
option(s) that determines the risk, reward, break-even point, and potential
rate of return of the strategy.
• High Implied Volatility
As mentioned previously, high implied volatility means that market
participants are expecting high volatility (that is, a lot of movement) in
the price of the underlying through that particular expiration cycle. That
means three things to the potential covered writer:
• Market participants see risk in the price of the underlying.
• Premiums may be elevated to reflect this risk.
• Rates of return may be higher than normal to reflect this risk.
Remember that the first and most important determining factor for a
covered-write strategy is a neutral to moderately bullish forecast for the
underlying price. High implied volatility is an indication that market par-
ticipants have built in the possibility of greater than usual movement in
the underlying price both to the upside and downside. In other words,
they see risk and, because of that, option prices and rates of return on a
covered-write are elevated to reflect this perceived risk. The investor who
is confident of a neutral to bullish forecast for the stock and who has a view
opposite the marketplace may be rewarded, if correct, by a higher than
usual rate of return. But remember: It is the neutral to bullish price fore-
cast that should be the first determining factor for a covered-write, never
the rate of return! The rate of return is simply an indicator of the risk level
perceived by market participants at that time. Using rate of return to deter-
mine covered-write strategies is a trap.
• Low Implied Volatility
Low implied volatility means that market participants are expecting
low volatility (that is, a lack of movement) in the price of the underlying
through that particular expiration cycle. That means three things to the
potential covered writer:
• Market participants may see low risk in the price of the underlying.
• Premiums may be depressed to reflect this lack of risk.
• Rates of return may be lower than normal to reflect this lack of risk.



==================================================
                     PAGE 29                      
==================================================

20 Chapter 1 The Covered-Write
Once again remember that the first and most important determining
factor for a covered-write strategy is a neutral to mildly bullish forecast for
the underlying price. Low implied volatility is an indication that market
participants may have built in the possibility of less than usual movement
in the underlying price both to the upside and downside. In other words,
they see potentially less risk, and because of that, option prices and rates
of return on a covered-write are somewhat lower to reflect this perceived
relatively reduced risk.
TRADE MANAGEMENT
Regardless of whether one falls into the short-term or long-term, high-
risk or low-risk category, one thing is for sure: After the trade is selected
and executed, it will have to be managed. As time passes and the under-
lying moves up or down, adjustments will have to be made. As we have
mentioned time and again in the preceding pages, the covered-write is
a neutral to moderately bullish strategy. If the behavior of the underly-
ing deviates from that scenario, that is, moves too far to the upside or
too far to the downside, action will need to be taken. When expiration
approaches and the written call loses all of its extrinsic value, action will
need to be taken, and, of course, if one’s market view changes or if one
wishes to lock in profits or reduce losses, action will need to be taken.
The covered-write is not the “forget about it and watch the money roll
in” strategy as seen on late-night television.
Adjustments
• Situation 1: Change in Market View
Once again, the covered-write is a strategy to be applied in a neutral
to moderately bullish environment. If one’s market view suddenly shifts
away from neutral to moderately bullish (that is, becomes bearish or ram-
pantly bullish) then the covered-write is an inappropriate strategy and
should be liquidated. There are actually two ways to exit a covered-write
quickly. One is to liquidate the original position as:
Example 1: Liquidation of a Covered-Write Consisting of Long 100
Shares of XYZ and Short 1 XYZ June 100 Call
+100
+100
–100
Calls Strike Puts Calls Strike Puts

==================================================

Trade Management 21
The second method is to utilize a synthetic relationship that exists
between a covered-write position and the put of the same strike and
e xpiration. A covered-write is actually the synthetic equivalent of a short
put of the same strike and expiration of the short call component of the
covered-write. This means that the covered-write behaves exactly as a
short put in terms of the risk, reward, and break-even points of the posi-
tion. So a quick way to cauterize a covered-write position is to purchase
the put of the same strike and expiration cycle as the short call in the
covered-write position.
Example 2: Liquidation of a Covered-Write Consisting of Long 100
Shares of XYZ and Short 1 XYZ June 100 Call Using the
Synthetically Equivalent Position
+100
+100
Calls Strike Puts Calls Strike Puts
–1 100 –1 100 +1
Original Position Closing Trade
Using this technique leaves a residual arbitrage position known as a
conversion. The conversion has very little risk but still may require some
capital to hold, and it may or may not have to be managed at expiration
regarding the exercise of the long put. This liquidation option is meant
for an emergency situation in which one has to bail out of the position
quickly.
• Situation 2: Underlying Moves Up Through the Strike
Once the underlying stock or index moves up through the strike, the
upside profit potential of the covered-write is capped. In order to give the
position some more upside potential, the short call has to be “rolled up” to
a higher strike. This can be accomplished by buying a vertical call spread,
covering the short call, and selling a higher strike call in the same expira-
tion month. Or it can be accomplished by executing a diagonal call spread
known as an up and out—covering the short call and selling a higher strike
call in a further deferred expiration month. Which method is chosen usu-
ally depends on the cost of the “roll.” The purchase of a long call spread
will cost the investor some money, thus adding to the cost basis of the posi-
tion, whereas the up and out diagonal call spread will usually cost less, or
depending on the time to expiration of the call to be sold, could even be
executed for no cost or a credit. For this reason, many covered writers opt
for the diagonal up and out adjustment.

In the preceding example, the 100/105 call spread is purchased, closing
out the short call position at the 100 strike and establishing a new short call
position at the 105 strike. This gives the position 5.00 more points of “room
to run” to the upside, but the cost of the strategy is increased by the cost of
the call spread.

In the preceding example, the 100/105 diagonal call spread is
purchased, closing out the short call position at 100 strike in the origi-
nal expiration month and establishing a new short call position at the
105 strike in expiration month n. This gives the position 5.00 more points
of “room to run” to the upside, and the cost of the strategy is increased
or decreased by the debit or credit, respectively, of the diagonal call
spread.
• Situation 3: The Underlying Weakens or Moves Lower;
More Protection Is Desired
The covered-write does offer a modest amount of downside protec-
tion for long underlying positions. The amount of this protection is equal
to the premium collected when the investor writes the call. If he wants
additional protection, additional premiums must be collected. This can
be accomplished by “rolling down” the short call to a lower strike by
selling a vertical call spread in the same expiration month. Or, it can be
accomplished by executing a diagonal call spread known as a down and
out— covering the short call and selling a lower strike call in a deferred ex-
piration. Both strategies should generate a credit that will provide further
downside protection for the underlying position. Which method is chosen
usually depends on the amount of protection wanted and the size of the
credit that can be generated.

COVERED-WRITES are not “fire and forget” trades. They require attention, and
multiple adjustments may have to be made to maintain one’s risk profile as
the market moves up, down, or sideways, and as the clock ticks.
The covered-write can be an excellent strategy for generating income
against a portfolio of stocks that will be held for the long term. Covered-
writes also offer modest (limited) downside protection for a portfolio, and
they may be an excellent trading strategy for very specific market condi-
tions discussed in this chapter: steady to rising underlying prices and/or
steady to falling implied volatility levels.
A word of caution, however, covered-writes are not the “instant cash
machines” or the “fire and forget” strategies as advertised on late night
television and Internet sites. Covered-writes require hard work, discipline,
and attention to detail. Underlying price and implied volatility levels need
to be monitored closely for possible entry opportunities. After the position

has been entered, the analysis of both underlying price and implied vola-
tility levels must continue. Adjustments to the position must be made as
price swings, changes in implied volatility levels, and the passage of time
shifts risk/reward ratios either for or against the trader.
It cannot be forgotten that covered-writes are risky positions, with a risk
profile identical to that of a short put. This means there can be large risk to
the downside with limited upside potential—not a great risk/reward pro-
file except for very specific market conditions as discussed. The downside
risk must be managed ruthlessly so that when the forecast of conditions
benevolent to a covered-write position—steady to rising underlying price,
steady to falling implied volatility—is proven wrong, the trader must exit
or neutralize the position immediately.

CONCEPT REVIEW
Implied volatility: The determination of the volatility component of an
option theoretical pricing model by using current prices along with
other known variables rather than historical prices and variables.
Synthetics:Two or more trading instruments packaged to emulate
another trading instrument or vehicle. For example:
synthetic long call (cid:2) long stock (cid:3) long put
synthetic short call (cid:2) short stock (cid:3) short put
synthetic long put (cid:2) short stock (cid:3) long call
synthetic short put (cid:2) long stock (cid:3) short call
synthetic long stock (cid:2) long call (cid:3) short put
synthetic short stock (cid:2) short call (cid:3) long put
Butterfly spread: A strategy that combines four option contracts of
the same type that span three strike prices. For example: Buy one
call at the lowest strike price, sell two calls at the next higher strike
price, and buy one call at the third highest strike price.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
A vertical spread is the simultaneous purchase and sale of options
of the same class (calls or puts) and expiration, but with different strike

prices. Vertical spreads are directional strategies typically employed u nder
the following circumstances:
• To capture moderate underlying moves to the upside or downside
• To implement limited-risk bullish or bearish positions when implied
volatility levels are high and the outright purchase of a call or put is
too expensive
• To help lower the overall risk of a bullish or bearish position
• To combine a directional view with an implied volatility view
• To help generate short-premium income in a limited-risk fashion
STRATEGY COMPOSITION
Depending on which strike is bought and which strike is sold, the ver-
tical spread can have either a bullish or a bearish bias. For example, if the
trader were bullish, he could purchase the bull call spread or the bull put
spread. Let’s look first at the components of a bull call spread and examine
the risk/reward profile (Figure 2.1).

Naming Conventions
Vertical spreads are basic spreads, but somehow there always seems to
be a great deal of confusion surrounding them. Most of this confusion comes
from terminology, and most of the confusion surrounding the terminology
comes from the cash flow aspect of the positions. Bullish or bearish vertical
spreads can be constructed using either calls or puts, but choosing calls over
puts or vice versa reverses the cash flow of the position. Thus, with vertical
spreads, bullandbear and long and short are constantly commingled and con-
fused. We will attempt to clarify this in the discussion that follows.
• Bull Vertical Spreads
Bull vertical spreads, or bull spreads, are a class of vertical spreads that
should profit when the underlying moves higher. Any vertical spread in
which a lower strike option is purchased and a higher strike option is sold
(with the same class and same expiration) is a bull spread, regardless of
cash flow or whether the investor is using calls or puts.
Bull Call Spread: In the case of calls, because a lower strike call is being
purchased and a higher strike call is being sold, the result is a negative cash
flow, or a debit.For this reason, a bull call spread is often referred to as a long
call spread and sometimes is called a debit call spread because the investor
has to pay for it.All three are the exact same position; hence, the confusion.
So, bull call spread equals long call spread equals debit call spread. It’s all the
same thing.
Figure 2.5 illustrates the structure of a bull call spread (or long call
spread). In this case the 100 strike call is purchased, and the 105 strike call is
sold.Because the 100 strike call will be more expensive than the 105 strike
call, this spread will result in a debit.
Bull Put Spread:When constructing a bull spread using puts, purchas-
ing the lower strike put and selling the higher strike put results in a positive
initial cash flow, or a credit. For this reason, a bull put spread is often referred
to as a short put spread and sometimes as a credit put spread, because the inves-
tor collects money for it.Once again, all three are the exact same position.

• Bear Vertical Spreads
Bear vertical spreads, or bear spreads, are a class of vertical spreads that
could profit when the underlying moves lower. Any vertical spread in
which a higher strike option is purchased and a lower strike option is sold
(with the same class and same expiration) is a bear spread, regardless of
cash flow and regardless of whether the investor is working with calls
or puts.
Bear Call Spread: In the case of calls, because a higher strike call
is b eing purchased and a lower strike call is being sold, the result is a
positive initial cash flow, or a credit. For this reason, a bear call spread is
often r eferred to as a short call spread and sometimes as a credit call spread
because the investor receives money for it. All three terms refer to the
exact same position.
Figure 2.7 illustrates the structure of a bear call spread (or short call
spread). In this case the 105 strike call is purchased, and the 100 strike call
is sold. Because the 105 strike call will be less expensive than the 100 strike
call, this spread will result in an initial credit.
Bear Put Spread: When constructing a bear spread using puts, pur-
chasing the higher strike put and selling the lower strike put results
in a negative cash flow, or a debit. For this reason, a bear put spread is
often referred to as a long put spread and sometimes as a debit put spread

Figure 2.8 illustrates the structure of a bear put spread or long put
spread. In this case the 105 strike put is purchased, and the 100 strike put is
sold. Because the 105 strike put typically will be more expensive than the
100 strike put, this spread will result in a debit.
Limited Risk, Limited Return
Because vertical spreads consist of an equal number of calls or puts
purchased and sold (that is, the ratio is always one long call and one short
call or one long put and one short put), the structures have both limited
risk and limited return. This is why they may be appropriate for specific
market views, which we will explore later.
THE GREEKS OF THE VERTICAL SPREAD
The “Greeks” of a spread position are equal to the sum of the Greeks
of the component parts of the spread. It may be helpful to review the defi-
nitions, characteristics, and sensitivities of the Greeks from Chapter 1.
Bull Spreads
• Delta
The delta of a bull spread is the difference in delta of the lower strike
(cid:2)
option and the higher strike option. For example, the delta of the 100 105



==================================================
                     PAGE 45                      
==================================================

36 Chapter 2 Verticals
bull call spread discussed earlier (and illustrated in Figure 2.1) would be
calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call delta 0.75
(cid:2)
105 strike call delta 0.25
(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)
100 105 bull call spread delta 0.75 0.25 or 0.50
Remember that puts have a negative delta, so the calculation of the
(cid:2)
delta of the 100 105 bull put spread would be as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike put delta 0.25
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike put delta 0.75
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)
100 105 bull put spread delta 0.25 ( 0.75) or 0.50
The delta of a bull vertical spread can range between zero and 100 de-
pending on the location of the underlying relative to strike prices, time left
until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other factors. Because it is
bullish, the delta of a bull spread will be either zero or a positive number,
but it will never be negative.
As can be seen in Figure 2.9, the delta of the bull spread is greatly de-
pendent on the location of the underlying and time until expiration. When
expiration is near and the deltas of the component options are very sensi-
tive to “moneyness” (whether they are in- or out-of-the-money), the delta
of the bull spread also is sensitive to changes in underlying price, particu-
larly when the underlying is between the upper and lower strikes and one
option is in-the-money and one option is out-of-the-money. Notice that
moving further away from expiration decreases the sensitivity of the bull

vertical spread. It is also important to note that the delta of the structure
always returns to zero at the extremes, illustrating the limited-risk, limited-
reward characteristics of this type of position.
• Gamma
The gamma (rate of change of the delta) of a bull spread is the sum of
the gamma of the lower strike option and the higher strike option positions.
Recall from Chapter 1 that a long option positionwill have a positive gamma
while a short option position will have a negative gamma. Therefore, in the
case of the bull vertical spread the lower strike option will generate positive
gamma while the upper strike option will generate negative gamma.
(cid:2)
For example, the gamma of the 100 105 bull call spread would be cal-
culated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call gamma 0.15
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike call gamma 0.05
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3)
100 105 bull call spread gamma 0.15 ( 0.05) or 0.10
Calls and puts of the same strike and expiration have the same gamma,
so the calculation of the gamma of the 100/105 bull put spread would be
calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike put gamma 0.15
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike put gamma 0.05
(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3)

(cid:3)
The gamma of a bull vertical spread can range between zero and 1.00
(cid:4)
or zero and 1.00, depending on location of the underlying relative to
strike prices, time left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other
factors.
As can be seen in Figure 2.10, the gamma of the bull spread is greatly
dependent on location of the underlying and time until expiration. When
expiration is near and the gammas of the component options are very sen-
sitive to moneyness (whether they are in- or out-of-the-money), the gamma
of the bull spread also is sensitive to changes in underlying price, particu-
larly when the underlying is near one of the strikes. Notice that the gamma
of the position is positive when the underlying is near the lower strike long
option, negative when the underlying is near the upper strike short option,
and neutral when the underlying is exactly between the strikes or on the
extremes. As with delta, notice that moving further away from expiration
decreases the sensitivity of the gamma of the bull vertical spread and that
the gamma of the structure always returns to zero at the extremes.
• Vega
The vega (sensitivity to changes in implied volatility) of a bull spread
is the sum of the vega of the lower strike option and the higher strike op-
tion positions. Recall from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have
a positive vega while a short option position will have a negative vega. So,
in the case of the bull spread, the lower strike option will generate positive
vega while the upper strike option will generate negative vega.
(cid:2)
For example, the vega of the 100 105 bull call spread would be calcu-
lated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call vega 0.28
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike call vega 0.12
(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3)
100 105 bull call spread vega 0.28 ( 0.12) or 0.16
Calls and puts of the same strike and expiration have the same vega, so
(cid:2)
the vega of the 100 105 bull put spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike put vega 0.28
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike put vega 0.12
(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3)
100 105 bull call spread vega 0.28 ( 0.12) or 0.16
The range of the vega of a bull vertical spread cannot be defined (math-
ematically). It is also dependent on the location of the underlying relative to
strike prices, time left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other
factors.
As can be seen in Figure 2.11, the vega of the bull spread, like the other
Greeks, is greatly dependent on the location of the underlying and time
until expiration. Notice that the vega of the position is positive when the un-
derlying is near the lower strike long option, negative when theunderlying
is near the upper strike short option, and neutral when the underlying is

exactly between the strikes or on the extremes. However, because vega in-
creases with time to expiration, notice that moving further away from expi-
ration increases the sensitivity of the vega of the bull vertical position as the
vega of the individual options increases with greater time to expiration.
• Theta
The theta (sensitivity to the passage of time) of a bull spread is the sum
of the theta of the lower strike option and the higher strike option posi-
tions. Recall from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a nega-
tive theta while a short option position will have a positive theta. So, in the
case of the bull spread, the lower strike option will generate negative theta
while the upper strike option will generate positive theta.
(cid:2)
For example, the theta of the 100 105 bull call spread would be calcu-
lated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike call theta 0.11
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike call theta 0.03
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4)
100 105 bull call spread theta 0.11 0.03 or 0.08
Calls and puts of the same strike and expiration have the same theta, so
(cid:2)
the theta of the 100 105 bull put spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike put theta 0.11
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put theta 0.03
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4)
100 105 bull put spread theta 0.11 0.03 or 0.08

The theta of the bull spread also is dependent on location of the under-
lying relative to strike prices, time left until expiration, implied volatility
levels, and other factors.
As can be seen in Figure 2.12, the theta of the bull spread, like the other
Greeks, is greatly dependent on the location of the underlying and time
until expiration. Notice that the theta of the position is negative when the
underlying is near the lower strike long option, positive when the underly-
ing is near the upper strike short option, and neutral when the underlying
is exactly between the strikes or on the extremes. Once again, notice that
moving further away from expiration decreases the sensitivity of the theta
of the bull verticalposition.
Bear Spreads
• Delta
The delta of a bear spread is the sum of the deltas of the lower strike
option and the higher strike option.
(cid:2)
For example, the delta of the 100 105 bear call spread would be calcu-
lated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike call delta 0.75
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike call delta 0.25
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4)
100 105 bear call spread delta 0.75 0.25 or 0.50

The Greeks of the Vertical Spread 41
Remember that puts have a negative delta, so the calculation of the
(cid:2)
delta of the 100 105 bear put spread would be as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:4)
100 strike put delta ( 0.25)
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike put delta 0.75
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:4)
100 105 bear put spread delta ( 0.25) ( .075) or 0.50
(cid:4)
The delta of a bear vertical spread can range between zero and 100
depending on location of the underlying relative to strike prices, time left
until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other factors. Because it is
bearish, the delta will either be zero or a negative number, but it will never
be positive.
As can be seen in Figure 2.13, the delta of the bear spread is greatly de-
pendent on the location of the underlying and time until expiration. When
expiration is near and the deltas of the component options are very sensi-
tive to moneyness, the delta of the bear spread also is sensitive to changes
in underlying price, particularly when the underlying is between the upper
and lower strikes and one option is in-the-money and one option is out-of-
the-money. Notice that moving further away from expiration decreases the
sensitivity of the bear vertical spread. It also is important to notice that
the delta of the structure always returns to zero at the extremes, illustrating
the limited-risk, limited-reward characteristics of this type of position.
• Gamma
The gamma (rate of change of the delta) of a bear spread is the sum of
the gamma of the lower strike option and the higher strike option positions.

42 Chapter 2 Verticals
Recall from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a positive gamma
while a short option position will have a negative gamma. So, in the case of
the bear spread, the lower strike option will generate negative gamma while
the upper strike option will generate positive gamma.
(cid:2)
For example, the gamma of the 100 105 bear call spread would be cal-
culated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike call gamma 0.15
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike call gamma 0.05
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4)
100 105 bear call spread gamma 0.15 0.05 or 0.10
Calls and puts of the same strike and expiration have the same gamma,
(cid:2)
so the calculation of the gamma of the 100 105 bull put spread would be
as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike put gamma 0.15
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put gamma 0.05
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4)
100 105 bull put spread gamma 0.15 0.05 or 0.10
(cid:3)
The gamma of a bear vertical spread can range between 1.00 and
(cid:4)
1.00 depending on location of the underlying relative to strike prices,
time left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other factors.
As can be seen in Figure 2.14, the gamma of the bear spread is greatly
dependent on the location of the underlying and time until expiration.
When expiration is near and the gammas of the component options are
very sensitive to moneyness, the gamma of the bear spread also is sensi-
tive to changes in underlying price, particularly when the underlying is

near one of the strikes. Notice that the gamma of the position is positive
when the underlying is near the upper strike long option, negative when
the underlying is near the lower strike short option, and neutral when the
underlying is exactly between the strikes or on the extremes. Once again,
notice that moving further away from expiration decreases the sensitivity
of the gamma of the bear vertical spread and that the gamma of the struc-
ture returns to zero at the extremes.
• Vega
The vega (sensitivity to changes in implied volatility) of a bear spread
is the sum of the vega of the lower strike option and the higher strike op-
tion positions. Recall from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have
a positive vega while a short option position will have a negative vega. So,
in the case of the bear spread, the lower strike option will generate negative
vega while the upper strike option will generate positive vega.
(cid:2)
For example, the vega of the 100 105 bear call spread would be calcu-
lated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike call vega 0.28
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike call vega 0.12
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4)
100 105 bear call spread vega 0.28 0.12 or 0.16
Calls and puts of the same strike and expiration have the same vega, so
(cid:2)
the vega of the 100 105 bear put spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike put vega 0.28
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put vega 0.12
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4)
100 105 bear put spread vega 0.28 0.12 or 0.16
The range of the vega of a bear vertical spread cannot be defined (math-
ematically), but it is also dependent on the location of the underlying rela-
tive to strike prices, time left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and
other factors.
As can be seen from Figure 2.15, the vega of the bear spread, like the
other Greeks, is greatly dependent on the location of the underlying and
time until expiration. Notice that the vega of the position is positive when
the underlying is near the upper strike long option, negative when the un-
derlying is near the lower strike short option, and neutral when the under-
lying is exactly between the strikes or on the extremes. Once again, notice
that moving further away from expiration decreases the sensitivity of the
vega of the bear vertical position even though the vega of the individual
options increases with greater time to expiration.
• Theta
The theta (sensitivity to the passage of time) of a bear spread is the sum
of the theta of the lower strike option and the higher strike option positions.
Recall from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a negative theta

while a short option position will have a positive theta. So, in the case of the
bear spread, the lower strike option will generate positive theta while the
upper strike option will generate negative theta.
(cid:2)
For example, the theta of the 100 105 bear call spread would be calcu-
lated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike call theta 0.11
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike call theta 0.03
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3)
100 105 bear call spread theta 0.11 ( 0.03) or 0.08
Calls and puts of the same strike and expiration have the same theta, so
(cid:2)
the theta of the 100 105 bear put spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put theta 0.11
(cid:2)(cid:4)
105 strike put theta 0.03
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3)
100 105 bear put spread theta 0.11 ( 0.03) or 0.08
The theta of the bear spread also is dependent on the location of the
underlying relative to strike prices, time left until expiration, implied vola-
tility levels, and other factors.
As can be seen in Figure 2.16, the theta of the bear spread, like the other
Greeks, is greatly dependent on the location of the underlying and time
until expiration. Notice that the theta of the position is positive when the
underlying is near the lower strike short option, negative when the under-
lying is near the upper strike long option, and neutral when the underlying

is exactly between the strikes or on the extremes. Once again, notice that
moving further away from expiration decreases the sensitivity of the theta
of the bear verticalposition.
Call Spreads vs. Put Spreads
As is evident in this discussion, the Greeks of call and put bull spreads
and call and put bear spreads (same strikes, same expiration) are similar.
They should be: They share exactly the same sensitivities, and in fact, ex-
actly the same characteristics. In fact, call and put bull spreads and call and
put bear spreads are synthetically equivalent to one other and may be used
interchangeably to accomplish the same task. Deciding which one is best
to use depends on the pricing at the point of execution. We will cover that
later in this chapter.
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
As mentioned in “Strategy Overview,” vertical spreads are directional
strategies. Because both risk and reward are limited by the offsetting pur-
chase and sale of a call or a put, they may be employed to target specific
market situations.
Moderate Directional Underlying Movement
In the “moderate move” scenario, the investor is expecting a directional
move, either up or down, of moderate magnitude. A vertical spread is well

suited to this type of scenario because its structure allows it to participate
in a directional move in the amount equal to the strike differential. So, if
the investor is looking for a rally to a certain point or a sell-off to a certain
point, the bull or bear vertical spread may allow him or her to target that
type of move. An investor would not use a vertical spread, for example, if
he were forecasting an up or down move of a large magnitude, because a
vertical spread would only capture a portion of such a move.
InFigure 2.17 the market has declined into support near the 95.00level,
but the upside rally potential is limited by overhead resistance near the
99.00 level.
InFigure 2.18 the market has rallied into resistance near the 102.00 level,
but potential for a downside correction is limited by underlying support
near the 98.00 level.
InFigure 2.19 the market is confined to a trading range by underlying
support near the 95.00 level and overhead resistance near the 102.00 level.

High Implied Volatility Levels
As discussed in Chapter 1, high implied volatility levels mean that the
option market is forecasting volatile movement in the underlying through
that particular expiration cycle, and option prices are marked up to reflect
this perception. This means that a bullish or bearish position consisting of
a long call or a long put can become exceedingly expensive and leave a
trader exposed to a great deal of implied volatility (vega) risk. Because the
vertical spread is composed of both a long and a short option, the price and
volatility risks are substantially less, allowing one to enter a limited-risk
bullish or bearish position without having to pay too high a price or having
too much exposure to implied volatility levels.
Lowering Directional Risk
In “Strategy Composition” it was demonstrated that the ultimate risk of a
vertical spread strategy is limited to either the cost of the structure, in the case
of a bull call spread (long call spread) or a bear put spread (long put spread),
or to the strike differential minus the sale price of the structure, in the case of
the bear call spread (short call spread) or bull put spread (short put spread).
Because of this, the vertical spread may be a good strategy for countertrend
trades (Figures 2.20 and 2.21) when the market or an underlying becomes
oversold or overbought and the trader is forecasting a bounce or a correction
against the trend. The danger in this type of trade is that if the forecast of a
bounce or a correction is incorrect, the trend usually continues and sometimes
accelerates in its original direction. This makes the practice of bottom picking
and top picking for a bounce or a correction quite risky. Using vertical spreads
in this situation may allow the trader to capture the bounce or correction if his
or her forecast is correct, but reduces the risk if the forecast is incorrect.
In Figure 2.20 the trader is anticipating a bounce from the 95.00 support
level, but realizes that if he is incorrect and support is broken, the downside
risk will be large, so the situation calls for a limited-risk bullish strategy.
In Figure 2.21 the trader is anticipating a correction from the 100.00 re-
sistance level, but realizes that if he is incorrect and resistance is penetrated,

Combining Directional and Implied Volatility Views
Because vertical spreads have both a long option (long vega) and a
short option (short vega) component, bullish and bearish trades can be
constructed with a rising or declining implied volatility bias included in
the position. This allows the investor to express a multidimensional market
view that includes both market direction and the direction of implied vola-
tility. As noted in “The ‘Greeks’ of the Vertical Spread,” the overall vega of
a vertical spread position is dependent on many things, but chief among
them is the location of the underlying price relative to the strike prices of
the structure. If the underlying price is near the strike price containing the
long option component of the vertical spread, the spread will have a posi-
tive vega. If it is near the short option component of the vertical spread,

                     PAGE 58                      
==================================================

Strategy Component Selection 49
the spread will have a negative vega. This allows the investor to tweak
the positioning of a bullish or a bearish position to include a long or short
volatility bias, should he wish to include one.
Income Generation in a Limited-Risk Fashion
Selling out-of-the-money options to collect premiums and help generate
income through time decay has long been a desirable strategy. The problem
with that strategy is that it is very risky, as the naked selling of calls and
puts leaves the investor open to unlimited risk should some sort of unfore-
seen event take place. Obviously this is highly undesirable—and downright
scary. Vertical spreads can offer a way around this. By selling limited-risk
out-of-the-money credit spreads (bull or short put spreads, bear or short call
spreads), investors can still sell premium and help generate income through
time decay. The advantage gained by using vertical spreads is that should
the unforeseen event take place, the investor’s risk is limited rather than
open-ended. The investor will lose money, but the amount of loss may be
limited, hopefully allowing him or her to stay in the ballgame.
STRATEGY COMPONENT SELECTION
So, how should one structure a vertical spread strategy? The answer
to that question depends on many of the variables we have discussed in
previous sections:
• What is one’s current market forecast?
— Bullish
— Bearish
• What is the magnitude of the forecast move?
— Choose a target price.
• What is the time horizon of the forecast move?
— Determine when one expects the target price to be reached.
• What is one’s risk appetite?
• What is the purpose of the vertical spread?
— Capture market movement
— Capture volatility movement
— Income generation
What Is One’s Current Market Forecast?
One could theoretically make money with vertical spreads without
having a directional bias, for example selling credit spreads. However,
typically one will have a directional bias, bullish or bearish, which is the
basis of the strategy selection. Remember that the bullish or bearish fore-
cast should be moderate for the vertical spread strategy to be appropriate.

==================================================

50 Chapter 2 Verticals
What Is the Magnitude of the Forecast Move?
For structuring purposes, it is important for the investor to have an
idea of target price—where he thinks the underlying is likely to go if his
bullish or bearish forecast is correct. This is important because, as we
saw in “Strategy Composition,” the point of maximum profitability of
a vertical spread is at or beyond the short strike (at or above the short
strike for a bull spread, at or below the short strike for a bear spread).
Ideally, the investor would like the underlying to move to the short
strike at or near expiration to capture the majority of the move with the
spread.
Example
The investor believes ABC is set to move from the 100.00 level to the
110.00 level. What strikes should he incorporate into a bull spread strategy
to make an optimal return on this move?
• Answer
Long the 100 strike option, short the 110 strike option (either calls or
puts, depending on pricing at the point of execution).
What Is the Time Horizon of the Forecast Move?
Again, for structuring purposes, it is important to incorporate a time
horizon into the forecast. This will allow the investor to choose the correct
option expiration for his bull or bear spread.
Example
The investor believes XYZ will move down from 90.00 to the 70.00 area
and that it will take two months for this to occur. What expiration cycle
should he choose for his bear spread strategy, to make an optimal return
on this move?
• Answer
The expiration cycle that most closely corresponds to his time horizon
forecast.
What Is One’s Risk Appetite?
Obviously the answer to this question plays a large part in strategy
selection. Because the risk in a vertical spread is limited, the investor can
choose the amount he or she wishes to risk before the trade is put in place.
By choosing which available spread to buy or sell and in what amounts,
the investor can tailor the risk of a bull or bear spread to his or her risk
appetite.

Strategy Component Selection 51
Example
The investor believes that GHF is about to move from 100.00 to 110.00
(cid:2)
and would like to capture this move with a bull call spread. The 100 110 call
(cid:2)
spread is offered at $5.00 while the 105 110 call spread is offered at $2.50. The
investor can only risk $250.00 per trade. Which bull spread can he buy?
• Answer
(cid:2)
The investor can only afford to buy one 105 110 call spread at 2.50.
(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:2)
$2.50 (per call spread) $100 contract $250.00 investment (not counting
exchange fees, commissions, and so on).
What Is the Purpose of the Vertical Spread?
Usually the purpose of a bull or bear spread is to capture a bullish or
bearish move, but other times there may be a volatility view involved or
the vertical spread position might be simply for income generation pur-
poses (credit spreads).
• Volatility View
If there is a volatility view involved, it is important to incorporate the
ultimate vega exposure of the vertical spread (the vega exposure at the
time and target zone) into the strike and expiration selection.
Example
The investor believes HIJ is going to go up from 120.00 to 130.00 in
the next thirty days and that implied volatility will decline sharply on this
move. How should he structure a bull spread strategy to take advantage
of this view?
• Answer
The vega exposure of a vertical spread is dependent on the location of the
underlying relative to the long and short strikes. When the underlying is near
the long strike, the position will have a positive vega. When the underlying is
near the short strike, the position will have a negative vega. Because the inves-
tor is forecasting a rally from 120.00 up to a target price of 130.00 along with a
sharp volatility decline, it will be important that the position have a negative
vega when the underlying arrives at 130.00. This means the investor will want
his bull spread’s short strike to be the 130.00 strike and the long strike to be
either the 120.00 strike or a 125.00 strike, depending on his risk appetite.
• Income Generation
If the purpose of the trade is to help generate income by selling prem ium
and collecting time decay, it is important that the investor believes that it is

                     PAGE 61                      
==================================================

52 Chapter 2 Verticals
unlikely that the underlying will move to the area of the short strike(s) of his
credit spread(s). How the investor determines this is subjective, however.
Technical analysis, fundamental analysis, statistical analysis, and so forth all
can play a part in this type of strategy.
Example
EFGH announces spectacular earnings results and gaps from 30.00
to 37.00 the next day. The investor believes it is highly unlikely the stock
will trade down to 30.00 again in the next six months. The investor would
like to generate some income based on this view by selling credit spreads.
Which strikes should he select for this purpose?
• Answer
If the investor believes the stock will not trade down to 30.00, then he
could initiate bull put spreads (short put spreads) within his six-month
time frame using 30.00 as the short strike and a lower strike (depending on
his risk appetite) as the long strike.
At the Point of Execution: Call Spread or Put Spread?
As mentioned earlier in our examination of the Greeks in “The
Greeks of the Vertical Spread,” bull call and put vertical spreads (long
call spreads and short put spreads) and bear call and put vertical spreads
(short call spreads and long put spreads) are synthetically equivalent to
one another. They have identical sensitivities and risk reward character-
istics; the only difference is price and cash flow. When executing a bull
spread— buying the lower strike option and selling the higher strike op-
tion—the bull call spread will result in a negative cash flow (a debit),
while the bull put spread will result in positive cash flow (a credit). Con-
versely, when executing a bear spread—buying the higher strike option
and selling the lower strike option—the bear put spread will result in
negative cash flow (a debit), while the bear call spread will result in posi-
tive initial cash flow (a credit).
Pricing Anomalies
It would seem to make sense that a particular spread executed for a
credit would be superior to a synthetically equivalent spread executed for
a debit. After all, one can collect interest on a credit balance, whereas one
must pay interest on a debit balance. Unfortunately, it is a bit more compli-
cated than that, and the fact of the matter is that this advantage is usually
a mirage.
Pricing models build interest costs, no matter how trivial, into the
price of each option. This means that options prices are discounted to com-
pensate for the cost of financing the position. The buyer of an option or a
spread will pay slightly less premium to compensate for the fact that he
will incur financing costs for his debit balance, while the seller of an option
or a spread will receive slightly less premium to compensate for the fact

==================================================

Strategy Component Selection 53
that he will receive interest on his or her credit balance. This discounting
tends to remove any advantage associated with a credit versus debit trade
of synthetically equivalent positions.
• The Box
The best way to illustrate this is to break out the interest-rate component
that accounts for the difference in pricing between a bull call spread and a
bull put spread or a bear call spread and a bear put spread. The structure
that contains the interest rate component and links bull and bear call and
put vertical spreads is a structure called a box. A box is composed of a bull
spread and a bear spread (same strikes, same expiration). Figures 2.22 and
2.23, next, illustrate the structure of a box spread:
Calls Strike Puts
(cid:2)1 100 (cid:3)1
(cid:3)1 105 (cid:2)1
Figure 2.22 The Long Box
Calls Strike Puts
(cid:3)1 100 (cid:2)1
(cid:2)1 105 (cid:3)1
Figure 2.23 The Short Box
Combining two debit spreads (a bull call spread and a bear put spread
with the same strikes and the same expiration) creates a long box spread.
A bear call spread and a bull put spread (same strikes, same expiration)
creates a short box spread.
• Box Value
The box is a neutral structure with an interest rate component. It has
no delta, no gamma, no theta, no vega—it can’t because it is composed of
(cid:3)
offsetting positions in two synthetically equivalent spreads (bull spread
(cid:2)
bear spread neutral). It does, however, have an interest-rate component,
and it is this component that explains the difference in pricing between
bull and bear call and put spreads.
At expiration, the value of a box spread will always be the difference
(cid:4)
between its strike prices (K K ). This is the maturity value of the box.

Any time before expiration, it will trade at a discount to compensate for
carrying costs. The discounted value, or the present value, of the difference

This means that the present value of the box spread carries a 0.05 dis-
count to compensate for carrying costs. Now we will apply this to the rela-
tionship between the bull and bear call and put spreads to explain pricing
differences (Figures 2.24 and 2.25).

Practical Uses
When it comes time to pull the trigger on a bull or bear vertical position,
whether at the point of entry or exit, we can evaluate which structure is a
better trade by incorporating the box formula into the evaluation process.

Strategy Component Selection 55
(cid:3) (cid:2)
Remember that call spread value put spread value box value. If the
equation does not balance, there is a relative advantage available.
Example
An investor’s “system” has given a buy signal on ABC stock and the
investor would like to initiate a 5-point bull vertical. He has two choices,
(cid:2) (cid:2)
buying the 50 55 call spread or selling the 50 55 put spread. The value of
(cid:2) (cid:4)
the 50 55 box is 4.95, and the quotes the investor is seeing are 2.50 bid
(cid:4)
2.60 ask, for the call spread, and 2.45 bid 2.55 ask, for the put spread.
Should he buy the call spread or sell the put spread?
• Answer
(cid:3) (cid:2)
If we use the formula call spread value put spread value box value,
we can compare the relative value of the call spread offer and the put spread
bid to see which, if any, has a relative advantage:
(cid:3) (cid:2)
CS PS BOX
(cid:3) (cid:2)
2.60 PS 4.95
(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:2)
PS 4.95 2.60 2.35
With the call spread offered at 2.60 and a box value of 4.95, the put
spread bid should theoretically be 2.35, but in the open market it is actu-
ally 2.45. So selling the put spread to initiate a bull spread is a trade that is
superior to buying the call spread. Here are some easier and faster short-
cuts for determining whether the call spread or the put spread represents
the better trade.
Bull Spread Rules
• If call spread ask (cid:3) put spread bid (cid:6) box value, sell put spread
• If call spread ask (cid:3) put spread bid (cid:7) box value, buy call spread
Bear Spread Rules
• If call spread bid (cid:3) put spread ask (cid:6) box value, sell call spread
• If call spread bid (cid:3) put spread ask (cid:7) box value, buy put spread
Example
An investor wants to initiate a 5-point bear spread. The quote on the
(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:4)
45 50 call spread is 1.40 1.50, and the put spread is 3.55 3.65. The box
is valued at 4.95. Should the investor sell the call spread or buy the put
spread?



==================================================
                     PAGE 65                      
==================================================

56 Chapter 2 Verticals
• Answer
(cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3)
Call spread bid Put spread ask 1.40 3.65, or 5.05
This is greater than the box value, so the investor should sell the call
spread.
Note:These techniques for identifying relative pricing advantages can
also be used when exiting a trade.
TRADE MANAGEMENT
Even though vertical spreads are pretty tame from a risk standpoint
(they are generally low-cost and have limited risk), it is still a good idea to
have a plan, regardless of whether one’s market forecast is correct or in-
correct. Good traders have their exits planned before they enter the trade.
These questions need to be addressed before the trade:
• What is the most efficient way to take profits? Losses?
• What does one do if the underlying reaches the target ahead of
schedule?
• What does one do if he or she is completely wrong on direction?
• What does one do if he or she underestimated the magnitude of the
move?
• What if volatility behavior or any of the other assumptions that went
into one’s forecast turn out to be incorrect?
One mistake that is consistently made by options traders (probably
because they tend to fancy themselves as chess masters) is staying too long
in a position or making too many modifications when their market view
changes from the initial forecast. The simplest and most effective rule in
risk management is this: If the trader is wrong, he should get out!
This means that if any of the assumptions that went into a market
forecast turn out to be wrong, the investor should get out of the position.
There is no room for hoping or praying . . .
Sample Adjustments
• When to Exit
There are two reasons to exit a trade: when one’s market forecast has
been met or when it has changed. The vertical spread is a directional strat-
egy meant to be applied when one is forecasting a moderate directional
move. If one’s view of the market suddenly shifts away from this forecast,
then the trade will need to be modified or liquidated, depending on the
shift in market view. In the case of liquidation there are two ways to exit a

                     PAGE 66                      
==================================================

Trade Management 57
vertical spread. One is to liquidate the original position, and (recalling the
section “Strategy Component Selection”) the other is to liquidate via the
synthetic equivalent.
• How to Exit
The decision whether to liquidate using the original position versus
the synthetic equivalent depends on two factors: price and liquidity. Price
is simple enough if one remembers to apply the pricing rules from “Strat-
egy Component Selection” and use the most advantageously priced bull
or bear spread to liquidate the position. Additionally, execution costs will
affect the overall price.
The other factor is liquidity, and liquidity issues usually have to do
with the moneyness of the individual options that compose the verti-
cal spread. As options move in-the-money, they acquire a larger delta,
and this makes hedging them riskier for market makers. Accordingly,
market makers will widen the bid-ask spread of in-the-money options
to compensate for this risk. Conversely, out-of-the-money options have
a lower delta, making hedging them less risky for market makers. This
usually results in out-of-the-money options having a narrower bid-ask
spread than their in-the-money counterparts. The net effect on verti-
cal spreads is that a spread consisting of in-the-money options usually
will have a wider bid-ask spread than a vertical spread consisting of
out-of-the-money options. This is because an in-the-money call vertical
has a synthetically equivalent out-of-the-money put vertical and an in-
the-money put vertical has a synthetically equivalent out-of-the-money
call vertical. This moneyness effect (especially on profitable trades) can
make using synthetically equivalent positions to exit a trade even more
appealing.
Example 1: Liquidation of a Bull Call Spread
Calls Strike Puts Calls Strike Puts
+1 100 +1 –1 100
–1 105 +1 –1 105
Bull Call Spread Bear Call Spread Closing Trade
In this example, the original position is simply liquidated by executing
the reverse position; in this case a bear call spread liquidates an existing
bull call spread. Sometimes liquidity or pricing issues arise in liquidating
the original spread. When these occur, the synthetically equivalent spread
may be used to close the position.

Calls Strike Puts

Residual “Box” Spread
This is an example of the dilemma that sometimes occurs when one
is correct and the vertical spread is profitable. In this example, a bull call
spread is now composed of in-the-money calls, leading to a wide bid-ask
spread on the vertical spread and making liquidation difficult. One choice
would be to employ the synthetically equivalent bear put spread to close
the trade.
Modifying the Trade
• “Rolling” Vertical Spreads
Occasionally the magnitude of a directional movement might be un-
derestimated and the trader may want to “roll” the spread into a different
set of strikes so that it can continue to participate in the further price move-
ment of the stock. When one’s price target is reached prematurely, or when
the underlying looks as though it might make a stronger move in the an-
ticipated direction, “rolling” the spread up or down can allow one to con-
tinue to participate in the move. Rolling a vertical spread is accomplished
by using another spread, the butterfly. Selling a butterfly that overlaps to
the upside rolls a bull spread up:

A benefit of rolling vertical spreads by selling butterflies is that it takes
a little money off the table and allows the trader to stick with the trade idea
and participate in the extended directional move. Selling a butterfly that
overlaps to the downside rolls a bear spread down:

Chapter 2 Exercise 61
Using this technique the trader is able to buy time should the under-
lying reach the target price prematurely, or participate in movement of a
greater magnitude should it appear that the underlying is set to continue
its directional move in a magnitude greater than originally forecast.

8. He can sell out the 105 110 call spread at $3.30 ($7.30 $4.00

spread for $1.55 ($2.70 $1.15 $1.55). The box value is $5.00
(cid:2)
$0.05 $4.95. If he legs into the box for $1.00 (the price at which he
bought the call spread) plus $1.55 (the price at which he bought the
(cid:4)
put spread), the total cost is $2.55. Therefore, his profit is $4.95
(cid:2)
$2.55 $2.40. Legging into the market neutral box gives the investor
an extra $0.10 of profit over outright selling of the call spread. This is
a good example of what happens when an investor’s original posi-
tion goes in-the-money and the bid-offer spreads widen out.
(cid:2)
9. The 110 115 call spread could be bought for $2.35, giving the inves-

tor a profit potential of $2.65. The 115 110 put spread could be sold
for $2.60, which is the same as his maximum profit. Therefore, buy-
(cid:2)
ing the 110 115 call spread gives him $0.05 more potential profit and
represents the best spread to play the move up to 115.

CONCEPT REVIEW
Implied volatility skew: Implied volatilities of the lower strike op-
tion increase as the strike prices fall, and implied volatilities of the
higher strike option fall as the strike prices rise.
Stop-loss order: A buy or a sell order placed in the market that is
triggered if certain price conditions are met, at which point it is
turned into a market order.
Support: The price level at which a stock historically has had dif-
ficulty falling below.
Resistance: The price at which a stock historically has had difficulty
rising above.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Collar and reverse-collar strategies can be used as bullish (reverse-
collar) or bearish (collar) stand-alone speculative strategies, or they can
be used to hedge or modify the risk in an existing bullish or bearish
position in the underlying market. We will explore both categories in
this chapter.

The Collar and Reverse-Collar as Directional Strategies
When used as options spread strategies, the collar and reverse-collar
usually are employed for very specific market scenarios:
• To help capture strong directional moves to the upside or downside
• To play contingent “if/then” types of scenarios
• To play specific breakout or breakdown scenarios

is structured so that the total cost of the spread is near zero, meaning that
the purchase price of the put is close to the sale price of the call. For this to
occur, the two options need to be approximately equidistant from the cur-
rent underlying price so that they carry approximately the same premium.
This structure gives the collar its name. (The premium carried by the two
options also is dependent on many factors, including interest rates, divi-
dends, implied volatility skews, and other factors.)
Figure 3.2 illustrates the typical structure of a collar. At the point of
initiation, the underlying price would be approximately 105.00 for the cost
of the collar to be near zero.

The reverse-collar (Figure 3.3) is a bullish spread strategy in which the
purchase of an out-of-the-money call is financed by the simultaneous sale
of an out-of-the-money put of the same expiration cycle. The reverse-collar
usually is structured so that the total cost of the spread is near zero, meaning
that the purchase price of the call is close to the sale price of the put. For this
to occur, the two options need to be approximately equidistant from the cur-
rent underlying price so that they carry approximately the same premium.
Figure 3.4 illustrates the typical structure of a reverse-collar. At the
point of initiation, the underlying price would be approximately 105.00 for
the cost of the reverse collar to be near zero.

Figure 3.4 The Reverse-Collar
THE VOLATILITY COMPONENT OF A COLLAR
OR REVERSE-COLLAR
The reason a collar or reverse-collar might be chosen for a particular mar-
ket scenario over another strategy, and one of the reasons for the popularity
of these trades, is that it is deliberately structured to minimize implied vola-
tility risk and time decay risk. As we will see when we examine the Greeks,
the structure of a collar or a reverse-collar—one long option, one short op-
tion, equidistant from the current price of the underlying—minimizes the
exposure to implied volatility risk and time decay, so that the timing of a
forecasted bullish or bearish move need not be precise. In addition, collars
and reverse-collars can be used to address any anomalies in the existing
structure of implied volatility at the time of the trade.
THE COLLAR AND REVERSE-COLLAR
AS HEDGING VEHICLES
Collars and reverse-collars can also make excellent hedging vehicles.
Wrapping a collar around an existing long underlying position will con-
vert the risk/reward of such a position into that of a limited-risk bull verti-
cal spread. Wrapping a reverse-collar around an existing short underlying

position will convert the risk/reward of such a position into that of a limited-
risk bear vertical spread. Traders can use collars and reverse-c ollars to modify
the risk of outright long and short underlying positions as market conditions
evolve, jumping from u nlimited-risk/reward to limited-risk/reward posi-
tions as they see fit.
Role of Synthetic Options Positions
The reason the risk/reward profile changes from that of an outright
position to that of a bull or bear vertical spread when a collar or reverse-
collar hedge is applied to an outright long or short underlying position is
that the combination of an underlying position with an option position cre-
ates a synthetic option position. Combining a long underlying position with
a collar creates a synthetic bull vertical spread; combining a short underlying
position with a reverse-collar creates a synthetic bear vertical spread.
• Collar-Hedged Long Underlying Position
As mentioned, combining a long underlying position with a collar cre-
ates a synthetic bull vertical spread. Figures 3.5 and 3.6 illustrate the synthe-
sis of a collar-hedged long underlying position into a bull vertical spread.

creating a synthetic short 110 put. This would transform the position into a
100/110 bull put spread, which, as we learned in Chapter 2, has the same
risk/reward properties as the 100/110 bull call spread.
• Reverse-Collar-Hedged Short Underlying Position
As mentioned above, combining a short underlying position with a re-
verse-collar creates a synthetic bear vertical spread. Figures 3.7 and 3.8 il-

sition, creating a synthetic long 110 put. This would transform the position
into a 100/110 bear put spread—which has the same risk reward properties

THE GREEKS OF COLLAR AND
REVERSE-COLLAR SPREADS
The Collar
The collar ultimately is a long out-of-the-money put coupled with a
short out-of-the-money call, and, on the extremes, it behaves as such. On the

                     PAGE 80

far downside, it is a long put; on the far upside, it is a short call. However,
the behavior of the Greeks in between the strikes and over time and ranges
of implied volatility makes this position interesting.
• Delta
The delta of a collar is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas of its
component options. For example, the delta of the 100/110 collar would be
calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 put delta 0.25
(cid:2)
110 call delta 0.25
(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4) (cid:4)
Collar delta ( 0.25 1) (0.25 1) or 0.50
Remember that the 100 put has a negative delta but a positive posi-
tion (long), yielding a negative position-adjusted delta. The 110 call has
a positive delta but a negative position (short), also yielding a negative
position-adjusted delta. The delta of the collar can range between zero and
(cid:4)
100 depending on the price of the underlying relative to the strike prices
involved, time left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other
factors. Because it is a bearish position, the delta will be either zero or a
negative number, never positive. Figure 3.9 shows the delta of the March
47.50/57.50 collar with the stock price at 52.50.

==================================================

72 Chapter 3 Collars and Reverse-Collars
As can be seen in the preceding figure, the delta of the collar, while
always negative, becomes increasingly negative as the underlying moves
below the lower strike, the long put moves in-the-money (or above the
upper strike), and the short call moves in-the-money. The sensitivity
of the delta of the collar to the underlying price increases as expiration
approaches. Notice, in the figure, the difference in the delta generated
at various times until expiration. At expiration the sensitivity becomes
severe, with the delta of the collar being zero anywhere between the
two strikes and –100 anywhere outside the two strikes. The sensitivity
is less severe with greater amounts of time until expiration.
• Gamma
The gamma of a collar is the sum of the position-adjusted gammas of its
component options. For example, the gamma of the 100/110 collar would
be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike put gamma 0.05
(cid:2)
110 strike call gamma 0.05
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4)
Collar gamma (0.05 1) (0.05 1) or 0.00
Recall that long options have positive gamma while short options
have negative gamma, and that the gamma of an option is greatly depen-
dent on the moneyness of the option, with at-the-money options having
the greatest gamma. Also recall that gamma is very sensitive to the time
to expiration. All things being equal, an at-the-money option near expira-
tion will have a greater gamma than an at-the-money option with greater
time left until expiration. The gamma of a collar can range between zero
(cid:3) (cid:4)
0.50 and 0.50 depending on the location of the underlying relative to
strike prices, time left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other
factors.Figure 3.10 shows the gamma of the March 47.50/57.50 collar with
the underlying at 52.50.
The following figure clearly shows how the gamma of the collar de-
pends on the location of the underlying and time until expiration. When
expiration is near and the underlying price is near the strike price of the
long put, the position will have a large positive gamma. When expiration
is near and the underlying price is near the strike price of the short call, the
position will have a large negative gamma. When the underlying is exactly
between the two strikes, the gamma will approach zero. Note that moving
further away from expiration (back in time) decreases the sensitivity of
the gamma of the collar, as illustrated by the flattening of the curve in this
chart. Also note that the gamma of the collar always returns to zero at the
extremes.
• Vega
Remember that vega is the sensitivity of option prices to fluctuations in
implied volatility. The vega of a collar is the sum of the position-adjusted

vegas of its component options. For example, the vega of the 100/110 collar
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike put vega 0.28
(cid:2)
110 strike call vega 0.25
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4) (cid:3)
Collar vega (0.28 1) (0.25 1) or 0.03
Recall that long options have a positive vega while short options have a
negative vega. So, in the case of the collar, the lower strike option will gen-
erate a positive vega while the upper strike option will generate a negative
vega. This means that the vega of the collar position will be positive when
the underlying price is near the lower strike long put, and it will be nega-
tive when the underlying price is near the upper strike short call. As with
gamma, vega also is dependent on moneyness, with at-the-money options
having a greater vega than in- or out-of-the-money options of the same
expiration. Vega increases with the time to expiration so that, all things be-
ing equal, the vega of an option with a larger amount of time left until
expiration will be greater than the vega of an option with a smaller amount
of time left until expiration. Figure 3.11 illustrates the vega of the March
47.50/57.50 collar.
The following figure clearly shows that the vega of the collar depends
on the location of the underlying price and time until expiration. Vega is
positive when the underlying price is near the lower strike long put, and it
is negative when the underlying is near the upper strike short call. Vega in-
creases as the time to expiration increases, as can be clearly seen in the graph.
The vega of the collar, whether positive or negative, is greater in absolute

terms when there is a larger amount of time left until expiration. When the
underlying is between the two strikes, the vega will approach zero.
• Theta
The theta of a collar is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas of its
component options. For example, the theta of the 100/110 collar would be
calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:4)
100 strike put theta 0.02
(cid:2)(cid:4)
110 strike call theta 0.03
(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:4) (cid:3)
Collar theta ( 0.02 1) ( 0.03 1) or 0.01
Because theta (time decay) is negative, a long option position will have
a negative theta (negative time decay) while a short option position will
have a positive theta (positive time decay). In the case of the collar, the lower
strike long put will generate negative theta while the upper strike short call
will generate positive theta. This means that the theta of the collar position
will be negative when the underlying price is near the lower strike long
put, and will be positive when the underlying price is near the upper strike
short call. As with gamma and vega, theta also is dependent on money-
ness, with at-the-money options having greater theta than in- or out-of-the-
money options of the same expiration. The theta of an at-the-money option
increases as the time to expiration decreases, so that, all things being equal,
the theta of an at-the-money option with a lesser amount of time left until
expiration will be greater than the theta of an at-the-money option with a
greater amount of time left until expiration. Figure 3.12 shows the theta of
the March 47.50/57.50 collar.

Figure 3.12 Collar Theta vs. Underlying Price and Time to Expiration
Source:LiquidPoint, LLC
As can be seen in the preceding figure, the theta of the collar, as with the
other Greeks, is greatly dependent on the location of the underlying and time
until expiration. Notice that the theta of the position is negative when the un-
derlying is near the lower strike long put, positive when the underlying is
near the upper strike short call, and neutral when the underlying is between
the strikes or on the extremes. The theta of the collar, in absolute terms, reaches
its peak when the underlying is at the upper or the lower strike price at expira-
tion, as, for example, with the March 21, 2008, data series in Figure 3.12. The
relationship softens as the time to expiration increases, as with the January 13,
2008, and February 16, 2008, data series shown in the same figure.
The Reverse-Collar
The reverse-collar, being a long out-of-the money call and a short out-
of-the-money put of the same expiration, is the exact opposite of the collar,
and will, of course, have Greeks exactly opposite those of the collar. The
calculation methodology remains the same.
• Delta
As can be seen in Figure 3.13, the delta of the reverse-collar, although
always positive, becomes increasingly positive as the underlying moves be-
low the lower strike (the short put moves in-the-money); or above the upper
strike (the long call moves in-the-money). The sensitivity of the delta of the
reverse-collar to the underlying price increases as expiration approaches.
Notice, in the figure, the difference in the delta generated at various times
until expiration. At expiration, the sensitivity becomes severe, with the del-
ta of the reverse-collar being zero anywhere between the two strikes as both
options are out-of-the-money and on the verge of expiring worthless. The

delta is 100 anywhere outside the two strikes where both options are in-
the-money and on the verge of either being exercised or assigned, resulting
(cid:3)
in a 100-share stock position. The sensitivity is less severe with greater
amounts of time until expiration.
• Gamma
Figure 3.14 clearly shows how the gamma of the reverse-collar depends
on the location of the underlying and the time until expiration. With the
option positioning now reversed, the position has a negative gamma when
the underlying is near the lower strike short put and a positive gamma
when the underlying price is near the upper strike long call.
When expiration is near and the underlying price is close to the strike
price of the long call, the position will have a large positive gamma; when
expiration is near and the underlying price is close to the strike price of the
short put, the position will have a large negative gamma; and when the
underlying is exactly between the two strikes, the gamma will approach
zero. Once again notice that moving further away from expiration (back in
time) decreases the sensitivity of the gamma of the position.
• Vega
Figure 3.15 shows how the vega of the collar depends on the location
of the underlying price and the time until expiration. The vega is positive
when the underlying price is near the upper strike long call, and it is negative
when the underlying is near the lower strike short put. As with the collar,
the vega of a reverse-collar, whether positive or negative, is greater in abso-
lute terms when there is a larger amount of time left until expiration. When
the underlying is between the two strikes, the vega will approach zero.

price is more or less between the strikes, or on the extremes. As with the col-
lar, the theta of the reverse-collar, in absolute terms, reaches its peak when
the underlying is at the upper or lower strike price at expiration, and the
relationship softens as the time to expiration increases.
COLLARS AND REVERSE-COLLARS (HEDGED
AGAINST UNDERLYING POSITIONS)
Collar-Hedged Stock
With the exception of delta, the Greek exposure of a hedged col-
lar position—long stock with a collar wrap—will amount to exactly the
same strategy as the collar (Figure 3.17). The stock position only con-
tributes to the delta portion of the Greeks, so the gamma, theta, and
vega of the positions will be identical to their positions in a traditional
collar.
Note that this is the same profile as the delta of the bull spread from
Chapter 2 because a long stock position hedged with a collar on a 1-to-1
basis is synthetically equivalent to a bull spread.
Reverse-Collar-Hedged Stock
Once again, note (Figure 3.18) that this is the exact same profile as the
delta of the bear spread from Chapter 2 because a short stock position
hedged with a reverse-collar on a 1-to-1 basis is synthetically equivalent to
a bear spread.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
Collars and reverse-collars (without stock) are directional strategies, with
the “long” option component positioned in the direction of the forecast move
and the “short” option component positioned in the opposite direction. The
usual reason traders choose a collar or reverse-collar, instead of another option
strategy, to trade a directional forecast is that they are unsure of their timing.



==================================================
                     PAGE 89                      
==================================================

80 Chapter 3 Collars and Reverse-Collars
If a trader is simply buying calls or puts, inaccurrate timing can be a very
expensive proposition. An outright long call or long put position is subject to
negative time decay, and if a trader is off on his or her timing forecast, each
day that passes costs money. In addition, long calls and puts have a posi-
tive vega, and if the market slips into an unexpected holding pattern before
the move, implied volatility may decline, lowering the value of purchased
options. This scenario is the dreaded “double whammy” of poor timing.
Because the structure of the collar and reverse-collar is one long option
and one short option, the timing issue is softened, so that time decay and
implied volatility risks largely offset one another, allowing the trader to stay
with the position longer while he waits for the forecast directional move to
occur.
Market Outlook
• Sharp Directional Underlying Movement
The trader of a collar or reverse-collar should be forecasting a sharp
directional move, beyond the strike of the long option of the position. The
owner of a collar should be expecting the underlying price to move sharply
below the strike of the long put component of the collar; the owner of a
reverse-collar should be expecting the underlying price to move sharply
above the strike of the long call component of the reverse-collar. As men-
tioned, the timing does not need to be precise with this type of position.
Figures 3.19 and 3.20 are good general examples of the type of movement
the collar and reverse-collar trader should be expecting.

• Mind the Risk!
As with many option positions, the collar and reverse-collar posi-
tions are double-edged swords. They allow for the luxury of waiting for
a sharp directional move without having to pay for time decay or risking

a markdown in implied volatility levels, but this comes at a price: the
severe risk of a naked short option position in the opposite direction of
the forecast.
So, in addition to the forecast of a sharp directional move, the trader
of the collar also should be prepared both financially and psychologically
for the prospect of the underlying price moving in the opposite direction.
Ultimately, this type of movement would give the trader the same position,
but with momentum moving the wrong way.
The trader of a collar, with a bearish view of the underlying, should be
prepared to become delta short if the underlying rises through the strike
of the short call portion of his or her position, or have a stop-loss in place
to close the short call. The trader of a reverse-collar, with a bullish view of
the underlying, should be prepared to become delta long if the underlying
drops below the strike of the short put portion of his or her position, or
have a stop-loss in place to close the short put.
STRATEGY COMPONENT SELECTION
In addition to a large-magnitude bullish or bearish forecast, choosing
the structure of a collar or reverse-collar requires an analysis of several
market parameters:
• What is the current market forecast?
— Bullish
— Bearish
• What is the trigger price for the forecast move?
• Where is significant resistance (in the case of a collar)?
• Where is significant support (in the case of a reverse-collar)?



==================================================
                     PAGE 91                      
==================================================

82 Chapter 3 Collars and Reverse-Collars
• What is the time horizon of the forecast move?
• What are current implied volatility conditions?
— What is the base level of implied volatility?
— Is there a significant implied volatility skew?
• What is the trader’s risk appetite?
— Large, able to accept open-ended risk
— Moderate to small; must use a stop-loss
What Is One’s Current Market Forecast?
This one is pretty simple. As we have stated, the collar is best suited
to a forecast of a bearish move of large magnitude. A reverse-collar is best
suited to a forecast of a bullish move of large magnitude. If one’s fore-
cast does not fall into one of these two categories, then a different strategy
should be used.
What Is the Trigger Price of the Forecast Move?
For structuring purposes, it is important to have an idea of the trigger
price—that is, the price that will be the “launch pad” of the forecast bullish
or bearish move. This is important information because, ideally, the long
put (in the case of a collar) or the long call (in the case of the reverse-collar)
portion of the position should be located as close to the trigger price as
possible to capture the majority of the forecast move.
Example
ABC is trapped in a range between 100.00 and 105.00. The trader
believes that the next time it trades through 105.00 ABC is going to
break out for a large upside move. In this case 105.00 is the trigger
price. (In technical analysis lingo, this is sometimes referred to as the
pivot price.)
Where Is the Significant Resistance (Collar)?
Again, for structuring purposes, it is important for the trader of a collar
to have an idea of where significant overhead resistance lies. Ideally, this is
where the short call portion of the position is located.
Example
The investor believes that GHF will collapse if it trades below 95.00.
Currently GHF is trading at 100.00, and there is large overhead resistance
at 105.00. The trader believes this is the ideal situation for a 95.00/105.00
collar. He decides to buy the 95.00 put at the trigger price and to sell the
105.00 call at resistance.

                     PAGE 92                      
==================================================

Strategy Component Selection 83
Where Is the Significant Support (Reverse-Collar)?
The trader of a reverse-collar will need to have an idea of where signifi-
cant underlying support lies. Ideally, this is where the short put portion of
the position should be located.
Example
The investor believes that ZYX will explode if it trades above 89.75.
Currently ZYX is trading at 87.50, and there is significant support below
the market at 85.00. The trader believes this is the ideal situation for an
85.00/90.00 reverse-collar. He decides to buy the 90.00 call at (approxi-
mately) the trigger price and sell the 85.00 put at support.
What Is the Time Horizon of the Forecast Move?
Even though the collar and reverse-collar are deliberately structured to
allow for some sloppiness in timing, it is still important to have an idea—
however it is arrived at—regarding when the underlying is going to make
its move. The expiration chosen for construction of the collar or reverse-col-
lar should comfortably cover this time horizon, with a couple extra weeks
thrown in for good measure. There is nothing worse than being “right”
about direction and not being “in” the marketplace.
Example
HIJ has been consolidating and the trader believes that if HIJ trades
through 120.00 it will explode to the upside. Previous consolidation pe-
riods in HIJ have lasted between ten and fifteen business days (two and
three weeks). Some of the available options expire in twenty-eight calendar
days, and others expire in sixty calendar days. The trader believes that he
needs the additional margin of error of the sixty-day option and constructs
his reverse-collar using options of that expiry.
What Are the Current Implied Volatility Conditions?
Implied volatility structure sometimes can be the deciding factor
when a trader is considering several different strategies to address a mar-
ket view. When the possibilities include the collar or reverse-collar, the
following implied volatility information should be a part of the decision-
making process.
• Base Level of Implied Volatility
The base level of implied volatility is the general level of at-the-money
implied volatility. Base level volatility should be evaluated in a historical
context when approaching any trade, including a collar or reverse-collar.
As mentioned, the structure of the collar or reverse-collar of one long op-
tion and one short option softens the exposure of the overall position to
implied volatility. The positive vega of the long option and the negative

vega of the short option act to cancel out the overall vega exposure of the
position (when the underlying is between the strikes). This means that the
collar and reverse-collar are good choices when one is looking to play a
large-magnitude directional move and base levels of implied volatility are
moderate to high.
However, if the base level of implied volatility happens to be low, it
might be better to choose a long put over a collar or a long call over a
reverse-collar, especially from a risk/reward standpoint. One would still
have the right position for a large-magnitude move, but without the risk
aspect of the collar or reverse-collar in the opposite direction.
• Implied Volatility Skew
Generally, in the case of equity and index options, the implied volatili-
ties of the lower strike option rise as the strike prices fall, and vice versa.
This often is referred to as the implied volatility skew. Trying to explain the
implied volatility skew and the reason it exists could open a can of worms,
and it probably deserves its own chapter, if not its own book.
It suffices to say, for our purposes, that different strikes of the same ex-
piration often trade at different implied volatilities, depending on market
conditions. In addition, implied volatilities of lower strike options tend to
be higher than those of higher strike options.
When the implied volatilities are plotted against strike prices on a
graph, they often exhibit a “smirk” or “smile.” Figure 3.21 is a good ex-
ample of the implied volatility skew smirk.
If the market demonstrates a large implied volatility skew, sometimes a
reverse-collar trade becomes more appetizing to the bullish trader because
the implied volatility of the put option being sold could be much higher
than the implied volatility of the call option being bought, giving the trader

an additional “edge” to work with. Conversely, if the implied volatility
skew is unusually flat, it can make a collar trade more appetizing to the
bearish trader because the implied volatility of the call option being sold
could be equal to or higher than that of the put option being bought, giving
the trader a potential “skew” edge.
Example
The trader believes XYZ is about to make a substantial upside move, and
is considering several bullish option strategies. The trader notices that, due
to recent weakness, XYZ options have a steep implied volatility skew, mean-
ing the out-of-the-money puts trade at much higher implied volatilities than
the out-of-the-money calls. The trader decides he can address this implied
volatility skew by using a reverse-collar for his bullish strategy.
What Is the Trader’s Risk Appetite?
Risk breaks two ways. If the trader has plenty of capital to work with
and is comfortable with the possibility that she might end up with a posi-
tion if the underlying moves in the opposite direction—getting long delta
with the market moving lower or getting short delta with the market mov-
ing higher—then there is no problem. The trader is simply getting long on
weakness or short on strength instead of the other way around.
If the trader has a moderate-to-low risk appetite, though, an exit strategy
will have to be put in place. In addition, stop-loss orders to close the open-
ended risk of the short call component will need to be in place when trading
collars, and stop-loss orders to close the semi-open-ended risk of the short
put component will need to be in place when trading reverse-collars.
All traders should keep in mind that stop-loss orders do not provide any
guarantees for how and when they will be executed, and they provide no
coverage when the market is closed. If a trader loses sleep over the idea of a
stock gapping up through his short call or down through his short put, then
the collar and reverse-collar are not strategies that should be considered.
TRADE MANAGEMENT
There are several important issues to consider when contemplating
using a collar or reverse-collar:
• What is the most efficient way to take any profits?
• How should one deal with adverse market movement?
• Where should the stop-loss orders be placed?
• What does one do if the underlying move fails to be triggered and
expiry is approaching?
Collar and reverse-collar trade management must be broken into two
categories: directional strategy and hedge. Both must be examined sepa-
rately because the motivation for them is different.

86 Chapter 3 Collars and Reverse-Collars
Managing Speculative Directional Strategy
Managing collars and reverse-collars falls into the following categories:
• Managing the successful position (directional move in the forecast
direction)
• Managing the unsuccessful position (directional move opposite the
forecast direction)
• Managing the position that fails to trigger
Managing the Successful Position
When the trade goes along as hoped, it is important to actively manage
the long put or long call component of the trade to squeeze the maximum
profitability out of that portion of the position, while either closing out or
deciding what to do about the residual and risky short option component
of the trade that is now far out-of-the-money. This is usually accomplished
by “rolling” the long option position along with the underlying by selling
vertical spreads.
Rolling a long option position is an excellent way to manage a position
that is “going your way.” Rolling accomplishes three important things:
• It maintains the exposure in the direction of the breakout.
• It reduces risk and takes “money off the table.”
• By accomplishing the above, it puts the trader in a strong psychologi-
cal position and increases his “staying power.”
Examples of Rolling
• Scenario 1
The trader, expecting a breakout to the downside after a period of con-
solidation, executes a 100/105 collar position. The market does indeed
break down, and the trader aggressively manages the position by execut-
ing a series of rolling trades, accomplished by selling vertical put spreads,
as shown in Figures 3.22 and 3.23.
In this scenario, the trader is rolling the long put portion of the collar
down with the market. Every time the underlying appears to lose down-
ward momentum, the trader sells a put vertical in order to reduce risk
and take money off the table, all while maintaining exposure. The trader
would continue to do this as long as he or she felt the down move would
continue.
• Scenario 2
The trader, expecting a breakout to the upside after a period of consoli-
dation, executes a 90/95 reverse-collar position. The market does indeed
break out, and the trader aggressively manages the position by executing

The long 100 put position is rolled down to the 95 strike. This is accomplished by

shown in Figures 3.24 and 3.25.
The long positions in scenarios 1 and 2 can be rolled as long as the trader
feels the directional move is likely to continue. As soon as the trader feels
the move is over, the position should be closed. It is also very important that
the trader not forget the trailing short call of the successful collar or short
put of the successful reverse-collar. Even though these options are out-of-
the-money, it is never a good idea to leave short option positions open, no
matter how far out-of-the-money they might be. Once the breakout has been
confirmed in a particular direction and the short option side of a collar or
reverse-collar loses most of its value, it should be closed. The trader should

be looking to profit from the opposing long position instead. Also note that
additional execution costs associated with each spread used to roll the posi-
tion will reduce profits.
Managing the Unsuccessful Position
When the trade is going against the trader, he will have to actively
manage the short call or short put component of the trade while deciding
what to do with the residual long put or long call component that is now
far out-of-the-money.
Whenever one considers entering a trade, it always is important to have
a risk-management strategy in place ahead of time. If, in fact, it becomes
clear that one’s forecast is incorrect, then it is time to get out the position,
hopefully in an orderly fashion. This usually is accomplished through the

Trade Management 89
use of stop-loss orders. As mentioned, stop-loss orders are buy or sell or-
ders placed in the market that trigger if certain price conditions are met, at
which point they are turned into market orders. Traders usually will use
stop-loss orders to close losing positions if key price levels are violated,
indicating an incorrect price forecast.
Example
The trader, expecting a breakout to the upside after a period of con-
solidation, executes a 90/95 reverse-collar position. Support is strong at
the 90.00 level, and if this level is violated it will indicate that the trader’s
forecast is incorrect. The trader places a stop-loss order to buy back the 90
put with an 89.99 stop. Unfortunately, the market does break down and the
stop-loss order is triggered, closing out the short put portion of the position
at a loss, as shown in Figure 3.26.

90.00 Short Put

Figure 3.26 Stop-Loss Triggered
The important point to remember about managing risk with stop-loss
orders is that they do not protect you when the market is closed. If there is
a gap opening due to news or some other event, the market could gap sig-
nificantly through the stop-loss level. Under these conditions, losses could
be very large before the position can be closed.
With an unsuccessful position, once the short call of the collar or the
short put of the reverse-collar is closed out, there will be an out-of-the-
money call or put remaining. If there is any value left in the long option,
the trader may want to close it out and salvage the remaining premium. If
the option has little or no value, it can be held as a “lottery ticket,” just in
case the market decides to reverse course before expiration.
Managing the Position That Fails to Trigger
If a collar or reverse-collar strategy makes it all the way to expiration
and does not trigger, the trader will have to decide whether he would like
to extend the strategy further. This would be accomplished with calendar
spreads: buying the calendar spread to roll the long option to a further expiry
and selling the calendar spread to roll the short option to a further expiry.

Example
The trader is expecting a break to the downside after a period of consol-
idation and executes a 100/105 collar. Unfortunately, the market does not
break down by expiration and the options are about to expire. The trader
still feels confident that the market is going to break down and wishes to
roll the position into the next expiration cycle. He rolls the position by buy-
ing the 100 put calendar spread and selling the 105 call calendar spread, as
shown in Figure 3.27. There will be additional execution costs.

The long 100 put position is rolled to the next expiration by purchasing the 100 put
calendar spread. The short 105 call position is rolled to the next expiry by selling the
105 call calendar spread. This rolls the entire collar to the next month, buying the trader
more time for his forecast.
Figure 3.27 Rolling the Collar to a Further Expiration
Managing Hedging Strategy
Recall from “Strategy Overview,” at the beginning of the chapter,
that applying a collar as a hedge to a long underlying position converts
the overall position to a synthetic bull spread with limited risk to the
downside and limited upside potential. Remember also that applying a
reverse-collar as a hedge to a short underlying position converts the over-
all position to a bear spread with limited risk to the upside and limited
downside potential.
Generally, these hedging strategies are applied whenever a trader feels
there is a threat to her position and would like to step into a limited-risk
exposure until the threat passes. Such threats include strong support or
resistance levels, government economic reports, earnings, or anything else
that would make a trader nervous about her position. The trader will apply
the collar or reverse-collar hedge when the threat level is high, and then
unwind it when she feels comfortable again.
Example
The trader has been profitably long XYZ stock for some time. Now XYZ
has traded up against a strong resistance level, and the trader feels there
is a strong likelihood of a setback. He decides to hedge the position by

wrapping a collar around it. If the stock corrects as he suspects, he will take
profit on the collar when it retraces to a support level and once again has
better upside potential, as shown in Figure 3.28.

CONCEPT REVIEW
Stop-loss order: A nonmarketable buy or a sell order placed in
the market that is triggered if certain price conditions are met, at
which point it is turned into a market order.
Consolidation: The movement of a stock’s price within a well-
defined pattern bounded by key support and resistance levels.
Breakout: A rise in the price of an underlying above a resistance
level or a drop in the price below a support level.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Straddles and strangles fall into the category of “nondirectional” strate-
gies. When one of these strategies is used, both a call and a put are either
purchased or sold, simultaneously. This means that one is not necessarily
forecasting a direction in the market, but rather a magnitude. These struc-
tures can be traded from the long side or the short side, depending on the
type of movement expected in the underlying stock or index.
• Long straddles and strangles are used when a trader is forecasting
a large magnitude move in either direction or an overall increase in
implied volatility levels. The trader seeks to profit from an increase
in the value of the position due to a rise in the intrinsic value of either
the call or the put as they move in-the-money, or a rise in the extrinsic
value of both the call and the put as implied volatility rises.
• Short straddles and strangles are used when a trader is forecasting
little or no directional movement in the underlying stock or index
and seeks to profit from a decrease in the overall value of the position
due to time decay or falling implied volatility which will lead to a
decline in extrinsic value of both the call and the put.

STRATEGY COMPOSITION
Long Straddles and Strangles
• The Long Straddle
The long straddle is a spread that consists of the simultaneous pur-
chase of a call and a put of the same strike and same expiration cycle in a
particular underlying stock or index. Usually, but not always, the trader
uses an at-the-money strike when initiating a long straddle. This is because
she usually wants to begin the trade close to delta neutral, since she does
not know in which direction the underlying is going to move.
Figure 4.1 illustrates the structure of a long straddle at the 80 strike. For
example, if the expiration cycle for the above structure were March, this
position would be referred to as a “long March 80 straddle.” At the point of
initiation, the underlying usually would be in the 80 range (Figure 4.2).

• The Long Strangle
The long strangle also is a spread that consists of the simultaneous pur-
chase of a call and a put, but of different strikes. Usually, but not always,
the trader uses out-of-the-money strikes that are approximately equidistant
from the current underlying price when initiating a long strangle. Again,
this is because the trader usually wants to begin the trade close to delta
neutral.
Figure 4.3 illustrates the typical structure of a long strangle. For exam-
ple, if the expiration cycle for the above structure were March, this position
(cid:2)
would be referred to as a “long March 720 740 strangle.” At the point of
initiation, the underlying usually would be in the 730 area (Figure 4.4).

Short Straddles and Strangles
• The Short Straddle
The short straddle is the opposite of the long straddle and consists
of the simultaneous sale of a call and a put of the same strike and same
expiration cycle in a particular underlying stock or index. As with the long
straddle, usually, but not always, the at-the-money strike is used when a
short straddle is initiated. This is because the trader usually wants to begin
the trade close to delta neutral.
Figure 4.5 illustrates the structure of a short straddle at the 1240 strike.
For example, if the expiration cycle for the above structure were March,
this position would be referred to as a “short March 1240 straddle.” At
the point of initiation, the underlying usually would be in the 1240 area
(Figure 4.6).

THE GREEKS OF STRADDLES AND STRANGLES
Straddles and strangles are spreads that capitalize on movement (or
lack thereof) in the underlying stock or index. In other words, volatility
plays a key role in determining the success or failure of these strategies. As
such, these strategies are geared to having a positive exposure (in the case
of long straddles and strangles) or negative exposure (in the case of short
straddles and strangles) to volatility, and are susceptible to the sensitivities
that come with it.
With all else being equal, the Greeks of long straddles and strangles
compared to short straddles and strangles usually are the exact opposite
of one another.
The Long Straddle
The long straddle is composed of a long call and a long put, and it car-
ries the sensitivities that all long option positions carry: positivegamma,
positive vega, and negative theta (time decay). The delta of a longstraddle
is dependent on the location of the underlying versus the strike. Because
of the way it is structured, the straddle will have a positive delta when
the underlying is above the strike price, a negative delta when the under-
lying is below the strike price, and approximately a neutral delta when
the underlying is at the strike price.

The Greeks of Straddles and Strangles 101
• Delta
The delta of a straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas of its
component options. For example the delta of the 100 straddle would be
calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike put delta 0.50
(cid:4)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5)
Long straddle delta ( 0.50 1) (0.50 1) or 0.00 (delta neutral)
In the above example, the 100 put has a negative delta but a positive
(long) position, yielding a negative position-adjusted delta. The 100 call has
a positive delta and a positive (long) position, yielding a positiveposition-
adjusted delta. The position in the example above has a delta of zero, and
so it is what is usually referred to as delta neutral.
(cid:3) (cid:2)
The delta of a long straddle can range between 100 and 100 depend-
ing on the price of the underlying relative to the strike price involved, time
left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other factors. The delta
will hover near zero when the underlying price is near the strike price.
Because it is a position that capitalizes on movement, the delta becomes
increasingly positive as the underlying stock or index moves above the
strike, or increasingly negative as the underlying stock or index moves
below the strike.
Figure 4.9 shows that the delta of a long straddle moves in favor of
the trader as the underlying moves, becoming increasingly positive as the

102 Chapter 4 Straddles and Strangles
underlying moves higher and negative as the underlying moves l ower.
The delta of the long straddle is approximately zero, or neutral, when
the underlying price is at the strike price. Eventually, if the underlying
moves far enough above or below the strike price, the delta will reach
(cid:3) (cid:2)
100 or 100 when the long call or long put component goes deep in-
the-money.
It also can be seen that the rate at which the delta of the long straddle
changes is sensitive to the amount of time left until expiration. The sensi-
tivity of the delta of the long straddle to changes in the underlying price
increases as expiration approaches. Notice the difference in the delta gen-
erated at various times until expiration in Figure 4.9.
• Gamma
The gamma of a long straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example the gamma of the long 100
straddle would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put gamma 0.05
(cid:4)
100 strike call gamma 0.05
(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5)
Long straddle gamma (0.05 1) (0.05 1) or 0.10
A gamma of 0.10 means that the delta of the overall position will
change by approximately 0.10 for every 1 point the underlying moves.
Long options have positive gamma, and because the long straddle is
composed of two long options, it also will have positive gamma. As
was seen in Figure 4.9, a positive gamma means that the delta of the
position will increase (become longer or less short) as the underlying
moves up and will decrease (become shorter or less long) as the under-
lying moves down. Obviously, this is a very desirable characteristic in
a position, but it carries a price, as we will see when we examine theta.
Gamma is greatly dependent on moneyness and time to expiration. All
things being equal, an at-the-money option near expiration will have a
greater gamma than an at-the-money option with greater time left until
expiration. However, short-dated options will “lose their gamma” more
quickly than options with greater time until expiration. Figure 4.10
shows the gamma of a long March 93.375.
Figure 4.10 demonstrates the dependency of the gamma of the long
straddle on the location of the underlying and time until expiration. What
is also demonstrated is that gamma itself is not linear. When expiration is
near and the underlying price is close to the strike price of the long strad-
dle, the position will have a large positive gamma. This dissipates quickly
as the under lying moves away from the strike price. When there is greater
time until expiration, the gamma curve is softer. The position still will have
the greatest amount of gamma when the underlying is at the strike, but the
rate of change in the gamma of the position as the underlying moves away
from the strike is less drastic.

• Vega
The vega of a long straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas
of its component options. For example the vega of the long 100 straddle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put vega 0.18
(cid:4)
100 strike call vega 0.15
(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3)
Long straddle (0.18 1) (0.15 1) or 0.33
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the price
of the straddle would change by approximately 0.33, rising when i mplied
volatility rises and falling when implied volatility falls. Long options have
a positive vega, so the long straddle also will have a positive vega. Recall
from Chapter 1 that vega is very sensitive to time until e xpiration of the
options. Vega increases with time to expiration so that, all things being equal,
the vega of an option with a greater amount of time left until expiration will
be greater than that of an option with a lesser amount of time left until expi-
ration.Figure 4.11 shows the vega of the long XYZ March 93.375 straddle.
Figure 4.11 demonstrates the dependency of the vega of the straddle
on the location of the underlying price and time until expiration. This is
opposite the behavior of gamma. All things being equal, the vega of the
long straddle is greater when there is a larger amount of time left until
expiration.

• Theta
The theta of a long straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas
of its component options. For example, the theta of the long 100 straddle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike put theta 0.02
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike call theta 0.03
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:2)
Long straddle theta ( 0.02 1) ( 0.03 1) or 0.05
This means that the value of the long straddle would decrease by
approximately 0.05 per calendar day. Because theta (time decay) is negative,
a long option position will have negative theta (negative time decay), so a
long straddle will have negative theta. Similar to gamma and vega, theta is
also dependent on moneyness, with at-the-money options having greater
theta than in- or out-of-the-money options of the same expiration. The
theta of an at-the-money option increases as time to expiration decreases
so that, all things being equal, the theta of an at-the-money option with a
lesser amount of time until expiration will be greater than the theta of an
at-the-money option with a greater amount of time until expiration. Fig-
ure 4.12 shows the theta of the long XYZ March 93.375.
Figure 4.12 should look familiar. It is practically the mirror image of the
gamma graph of Figure 4.10. This is the “no free lunch” connection between
long gamma and negative theta. Having a position like a long straddle that
gets long when the market goes up or gets short when the market goes down
has a price tag, and it is the time decay that one experiences when holding

such a position. As can be seen with the March 20, 2008 series in Figure 4.12,
the theta of the long straddle, in absolute terms, reaches its peak when the un-
derlying is at the strike price, and increases with the approach of expiration.
The Long Strangle
The long strangle, being a less aggressive version of the long straddle
(long out-of-the-money options rather than at-the-money options), carries
sensitivities that are similar to those of the long straddle.
• Delta
The delta of a long strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas of
(cid:2)
its component options. For example, the delta of the long 100 110 strangle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike put delta 0.25
(cid:4)(cid:3)
110 strike call delta 0.25
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5)
Long strangle delta ( 0.25 1) (0.25 1) or 0.00 (delta neutral)
In the preceding example, the 100 put has a negative delta but a positive
(long) position, yielding a negative position-adjusted delta. The 110 call has
a positive delta and a positive (long) position, yielding a positive position-
(cid:3) (cid:2)
adjusted delta. The delta of a long strangle can range between 100 and 100
depending on the price of the underlying relative to the strike prices involved,
time left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other factors.

==================================================

106 Chapter 4 Straddles and Strangles
Because of the way it is structured, the delta of a long strangle some-
times can be difficult to quantify. When there is plenty of time left until expi-
ration, the position generally will have a positive delta when the underlying
is above the midpoint between the two strike prices, a negative delta when
the underlying is below the midpoint between the two strike prices, and
an approximately neutral delta when the underlying is at the midpoint be-
tween the strike prices. However, because the long strangle is composed of
long out-of-the-money options, when near expiration the position will only
have a positive delta when the underlying is above the strike of the long
call, and a negative delta when the underlying is below the strike of the long
put. When the position is between the two strikes, it will be approximately
delta neutral. This effect can be seen in Figure 4.13.

(cid:2)
to Expiration—Long XYZ March 86.625 100 Strangle
Source:LiquidPoint, LLC
It can be seen in Figure 4.13 that the delta of a long strangle, similar to
that of the long straddle, moves in favor of the trader as the underlying
moves, becoming increasingly positive as the underlying moves higher,
and negative as the underlying moves lower.
The delta of the long strangle is approximately zero, or neutral, when
the underlying price is exactly between the two strike prices. Eventually, if
the underlying moves far enough above or below the strike price, the delta
(cid:3) (cid:2)
will reach 100 or 100 when the long call or long put component goes
deep in-the-money. Note, however, the delta of the long strangle when
expiration is close. It will be approximately neutral anywhere betweenthe
two strike prices.
Like the long straddle, the rate at which the delta of the long strangle
changes is sensitive to the amount of time left until expiration. Again, notice

in Figure 4.13 the difference in the delta generated at various times until
expiration.
• Gamma
The gamma of a long strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted gam-
(cid:2)
mas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the long 100 110
strangle would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put gamma 0.025
(cid:4)
110 strike call gamma 0.025
(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5)
Long strangle gamma (0.025 1) (0.025 1) or 0.05
A gamma of 0.05 means that the delta of the overall position would
change by approximately 0.05 for every 1 point the underlying moved. Like
the long straddle, the long strangle is composed of two long options, so it
will have positive gamma. The delta of the position will increase ( become
longer or less short) as the underlying moves up and will decrease (become
shorter or less long) as the underlying moves down. Unlike the long strad-
dle, though, the long strangle has its long optionslocated at different strikes,
giving the graph of the gamma near expiration a double-peaked M aspect
rather than the single-peak appearance associated with the gamma of a long
straddle.Figure 4.14 shows the gamma of a long strangle.
Figure 4.14 demonstrates the difference in the gamma between a long
strangle near expiration and a long straddle near expiration. As expira-
tion approaches, the gamma “accumulates” around the strikes of the long

options in two different locations. With a greater time left to expiration, the
gamma of the long strangle and the long straddle have greater similarity.
This is true of all of the Greeks.
• Vega
The vega of a long strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas of
(cid:2)
its component options. For example, the vega of the long 100 110 strangle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put vega 0.18
(cid:4)
110 strike call vega 0.15
(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3)
Long strangle vega (0.18 1) (0.15 1) or 0.33
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the
price of the strangle would change by approximately 0.33, rising when im-
plied volatility rises and falling when implied volatility falls. Long options
have a positive vega, so the long strangle also will have a positive vega.
Figure 4.15 shows the vega of the long XYZ March 86.625(cid:2) 100 strangle.
Figure 4.15 shows the dependency of the vega of the long strangle
on the location of the underlying price and time until expiration, with
l onger-dated options having greater sensitivity to implied volatility than
their shorter-dated cousins. Note the difference in vega between the long
strangle and the long straddle near expiration, with the double-peaked M
aspect once again visible in the March 21, 2008, data series.

• Theta
The theta of a long strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas of

its component options. For example, the theta of the long 100 110 strangle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)

Long strangle theta ( 0.015 1) ( 0.015 1) or 0.03
This means that the value of the long strangle would decrease by
approximately 0.03 per calendar day. As with the long straddle, the theta
of the long strangle also is dependent on moneyness with at-the- money
options having greater theta than in- or out-of-the-money options of
the same expiration. Figure 4.16 shows the theta of the long XYZ March

is a mirror image of the gamma of the long strangle in Figure 4.14. Once
again, note the difference in theta between the long strangle and the long
straddle near expiration, with the double-valley W aspect visible in the
March 21, 2008, data series.
The Short Straddle
Because the short straddle is composed of a short call and a short put, it
carries the sensitivities that all short option positions carry: negative gamma,

negative vega, and positive theta. The delta of a short straddle is dependent on
the location of the underlying versus the strike. Because of the way it is struc-
tured, the straddle will have a negative delta when the underlying is above the
strike price, a positive delta when the underlying is below the strike price, and
an approximately neutral delta when the underlying is at the strike price.
• Delta
The delta of a short straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas
of its component options. For example, the delta of the 100 straddle would
be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike put delta 0.50
(cid:4)(cid:3)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:2)
Short straddle delta ( 0.50 1) (0.50 1) or 0.00 (delta neutral)
In the above example, the 100 put has a negative delta and a negative (short)
position, yielding a positive position-adjusted delta. The 100 call has a posi-
tive delta but a negative (short) position, yielding a negativeposition-adjusted
delta. The position in the example above has a delta of zero, or is delta neutral.
(cid:3) (cid:2)
The delta of a short straddle can range between 100 and 100 depend-
ing on the price of the underlying relative to the strike price involved, time
left until expiration, implied volatility levels, and other factors. The delta
will hover near zero when the underlying price is near the strike price. Fig-
ure 4.17 shows the delta of a short XYZ March 93.375 straddle.

as the underlying moves, becoming increasingly negative as the underlying

moves higher and positive as the underlying moves lower. The delta of the
short straddle will be approximately zero, or neutral, when the underlying
price is at the strike price. Eventually, if the underlying moves far enough
(cid:2) (cid:3)
above or below the strike price, the delta will reach 100 or 100 when the
short call or short put component goes deep in-the-money.
As with the long straddle, the rate at which the delta of the short strad-
dle changes is sensitive to the amount of time left until expiration. Notice
in Figure 4.17 the difference in the delta generated at various times until
expiration.
• Gamma
The gamma of a short straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the short
100 straddle would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put gamma 0.05
(cid:4)
100 strike call gamma 0.05
(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:2)
Short straddle gamma (0.05 1) (0.05 1) or 0.10
(cid:2)
A gamma of 0.10 means that the delta of the overall position will change
against the trader by approximately 0.10 for every 1 point the underlying
moves. The delta of the position will decrease (become shorter or less long)
as the underlying moves up, and increase (become longer or less short) as
the underlying moves down. Obviously, this is a not a very desirable char-
acteristic in a position, but there is a silver lining, as we can see when we
examine theta. Figure 4.18 illustrates the gamma of a short straddle.

==================================================

112 Chapter 4 Straddles and Strangles
Figure 4.18 shows the dependency of the gamma of the short straddle
on the location of the underlying and the time until expiration. The gamma
of a short straddle is at its greatest when the underlying price is at the
strike price. Short-dated at-the-money options have a higher gamma than
at-the-money options with a greater amount of time to expiration.
• Vega
The vega of a short straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas
of its component options. For example, the vega of the short 100 straddle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put vega 0.18
(cid:4)
100 strike call vega 0.15
(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:2)
Short straddle vega (0.18 1) (0.15 1) or 0.33
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the
price of the straddle would change by approximately 0.33, rising by this
amount when implied volatility rises and falling by this amount when
implied volatility falls. So, the profitability of a short straddle position
would increase by 0.33 per 1 percent fall in implied volatility or decrease
by 0.33 per 1 percent increase in implied volatility. The vega increaseswith
time to expiration so that, all things being equal, the vega of an option with
a greater amount of time left until expiration will be larger than that of an
option with a lesser amount of time left until expiration. Figure 4.19 illus-
trates the vega of a short straddle.

The Greeks of Straddles and Strangles 113
Figure 4.19 shows how the vega of the short straddle depends on the
location of the underlying price and time until expiration. All things being
equal, the vega of the short straddle is greater when there is a larger amount
of time left until expiration.
• Theta
The theta of a short straddle is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas
of its component options. For example, the theta of the short 100 straddle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike put theta 0.02
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike call theta 0.03
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3)
Short straddle theta ( 0.02 1) ( 0.03 1) or 0.05
This means that the value of the straddle would decrease by approxi-
mately 0.05 per calendar day. Because theta (time decay) is negative, a short
option position such as a short straddle will have positive theta (positive
time decay), so the profitability of a short straddle position would increase
by 0.05 per calendar day. The theta of an at-the-money option increases as
the time to expiration decreases so that, all things being equal, the theta of
an at-the-money option with a lesser amount of time until expiration will be
greater than the theta of an at-the-money option with a greater amount of
time until expiration. Figure 4.20 illustrates the theta of a short straddle.

ing movement by becoming delta short when the market goes up or delta

long when the market goes down has the silver lining of a positive theta.
In theory, if all things are equal, every day that passes makes the short
straddle position more profitable. As shown by the March 21, 2008 series in
Figure 4.20, the theta of the short straddle is always positive, and it reaches
its peak when the underlying is at the strike price, increasing with the
approach of expiration.
The Short Strangle
The short strangle is a less aggressive version of the short straddle,
using short out-of-the-money options rather than at-the-money options.
Its sensitivities are similar to those of the short straddle.
• Delta
The delta of a short strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas
(cid:2)
of its component options. For example, the delta of the short 100 110 stran-
gle would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike put delta 0.25
(cid:4)
110 strike call delta 0.25
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:2)
Short strangle delta ( 0.25 1) (0.25 1) or 0.00 (delta neutral)
In the above example, the 100 put has a negative delta and a negative
(short) position, yielding a positive position-adjusted delta. The 100 call
has a positive delta and a negative (short) position, yielding a negative
position-adjusted delta. The position in the example above has a delta of
zero; it is delta neutral.
With the short strangle, when there is plenty of time left until
expiration, the position generally has a negative delta when the under-
lying is above the midpoint between the two strike prices, a positive
delta when the underlying is below the midpoint between the two strike
prices, and an approximately neutral delta when the underlying is at
the midpoint between the strike prices. However, because the short
strangle is composed of short out-of-the-money options, when near
expiration, the position will only have a negative delta when the un-
derlying is above the strike of the short call; it will have a positive delta
when the underlying is below the strike of the short put. When between
the two strikes, it will be approximately delta neutral. This effect can be
seen in Figure 4.21.
Figure 4.21 shows that the delta of a short strangle moves against the
trader as the underlying moves, becoming increasingly positive as the
underlying moves lower and negative as the underlying moves higher.
The delta of the short strangle is approximately zero, or neutral, when
the underlying price is exactly between the two strike prices. Eventually,
if the underlying moves far enough above or below the strike price, the
(cid:2) (cid:3)
delta will reach 100 or 100, when the short call or short put component

goes deep in-the-money. Note, however, the delta of the short strangle
when expiration is close. It will be approximately neutral anywhere
betweenthe two strike prices.
• Gamma
The gamma of a short strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the short
(cid:2)
100 110 strangle would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put gamma 0.025
(cid:4)
110 strike call gamma 0.025
(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:2)
Short strangle gamma (0.025 1) (0.025 1) or 0.05
(cid:2)
A gamma of 0.05 means that the delta of the overall position will
change by approximately 0.05 for every 1 point the underlying moves.
The short strangle has negative gamma, so the delta of the position will
decrease (become shorter or less long) as the underlying moves up and
will increase (become longer or less short) as the underlying moves down.
Unlike the short straddle, the short strangle has its short options located
at different strikes, giving the graph of the gamma near expiration the
double-valley W aspect rather than the single valley associated with the
gamma of a short straddle. Figure 4.22 illustrates the gamma of a short
strangle.

(cid:2)

Source:LiquidPoint, LLC
Figure 4.22 shows the difference in the gamma between a short
strangle near expiration and a short straddle near expiration. As e xpiration
approaches, the gamma “accumulates” around the strikes of the short
options in two different locations. With a greater time left to expiration, the
gamma of the short strangle and gamma of the short straddle are more simi-
lar. Again, this is true of all of the Greeks.
• Vega
The vega of a short strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas of
(cid:2)
its component options. For example, the vega of the short 100 110 strangle
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
100 strike put vega 0.10
(cid:4)
110 strike call vega 0.09
(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:2)
Short strangle vega (0.10 1) (0.09 1) or 0.19
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the
price of the strangle will change by approximately 0.19, rising when
implied volatility rises and falling when implied volatility falls. So the
profitability of a short strangle position would increase by 0.19 for every
1 percent decrease in implied volatility and would decrease by 0.19 for
every 1 percent increase in implied volatility. Figure 4.23 illustrates the
vega of a short strangle.

Figure 4.23 illustrates the dependency of the vega of the short strangle
on the location of the underlying price and the time until expiration, with
shorter-dated options having less sensitivity to implied volatility than their
longer-dated cousins.
• Theta
The theta of a short strangle is the sum of the position-adjusted the-
(cid:2)
tas of its component options. For example, the theta of the short 100 110
strangle would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
100 strike put theta 0.015
(cid:4)(cid:2)
110 strike call theta 0.015
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:3)
Short strangle theta ( 0.015 1) ( 0.015 1) or 0.03
This means that the value of the strangle would decrease by approxi-
mately 0.03 per calendar day, so the profitability of a short strangle posi-
tion would increase by approximately 0.03 per calendar day. The theta of
the short strangle is dependent on moneyness, with at-the-money options
having greater theta than in- or out-of-the-money options of the same
expiration.Figure 4.24 illustrates the theta of a short strangle.
As with the short straddle, note that the theta of the short strangle in-
creases as expiration approaches. Note also the difference in theta between
the short strangle and the short straddle near expiration, with the double-
peakedM aspect visible in the March 21, 2008, data series.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
Straddles and strangles are nondirectional strategies designed to profit
from the type of move forecast rather than the direction of a move. Long
straddles and strangles are geared to profit from movement in the under-
lying position and/or increasing implied volatility. They also have limited
risk and unlimited profit potential, but suffer from negative time decay.
Short straddles and strangles are geared to profit from a lack of movement
and/or declining implied volatility. They also have unlimited risk and lim-
ited profit potential, but have positive time decay. The investment objec-
tives of these strategies are highlighted below.
Long straddles and strangles:
• Price appreciation due to a large gain in the intrinsic value of the long
call or put
• Price appreciation due to an increase in implied volatility, raising the
price of both the call and the put
Short straddles and strangles:
• Price depreciation due to the time decay of the short call and put
• Price depreciation due to the decrease in implied volatility, lowering
the price of both the call and the put

STRATEGY COMPONENT SELECTION
Market Outlook: Long Straddles and Strangles
• Large-Magnitude Movement in an Unknown Direction
In this scenario, the trader of a long straddle or strangle should be look-
ing for a large magnitude move (that is, a breakout) away from the strike
price. This may be in response to an event such as an earnings report, a
new product launch, a government report, a significant corporate event, or
a macroeconomic event that will affect the market as a whole. It also could
be technically driven. In fact, any situation that sets up an underlying stock
or index for a large magnitude move in either direction is a candidate for
a long straddle or strangle. The forecast move should be large enough that
the position will pick up a significant increase in the intrinsic value of either
the long call or long put, depending on which way the underlying stock or
index moves. The owner of a long straddle or strangle should be expecting
the underlying price to move sharply above or below the strike or strikes
of the position. Figure 4.25 is a good example of the type of movement the
buyer of a long straddle or strangle should be expecting.

• Increase in Implied Volatility
In this scenario, the trader of a long straddle or strangle should be look-
ing for a general increase in the volatility of the underlying such that the
implied volatility of the options increase. The trader is expecting to profit
from a rise in the value of the straddle or strangle when the market partici-
pants mark up the level of implied volatility to reflect the increase in the
volatility of the underlying. Figure 4.26 illustrates this scenario.

• Low-Magnitude Directionless Movement
In this scenario, the trader of a short straddle or strangle should be
looking for subdued low magnitude movement (that is, a sideways mar-
ket) around the strike price. This scenario usually sets up after a period of
volatile movement, when the market is in need of a “rest.” It also could be
seasonal, for example, during a holiday or post earnings, etc. Or it could
be technically driven. The seller of a straddle or a strangle should be
expecting the underlying price to move in a sideways fashion, and could
profit from time decay and/or a decline in implied volatility. Figure 4.27
illustrates a sideways market.

• Risk: Long Straddles and Strangles
Because long straddles and strangles are composed of long calls and
puts, risk is limited. This doesn’t mean that they can be put on and then

Trade Management 121
forgotten. Even though the risk is limited, long straddles and strangles
still can produce painful losses if the trader’s forecast is incorrect or
his timing is off. Paying time decay on a long straddle or strangle posi-
tion is like the death of a thousand cuts—each day’s decay seems insig-
nificant, but before you realize it, you are bleeding money. Movement
of the underlying works in the trader’s favor with a long straddle or
strangle, but movement of the clock does not. Therefore, it is important
to set both price and time constraints on these types of positions. It is
important to quantify the price risk and the time risk you are willing
to take before the trade is made and exit when the lesser of the two is
reached.
• Risk: Short Straddles and Strangles
Because short straddles and strangles are composed of short calls and
puts, risk is unlimited. This means they must be actively managed using
stop-loss orders, as discussed in the previous chapter. The trader should be
able to identify key price levels that, if breached, would indicate that her
forecast of subdued movement is incorrect. If these levels are broken, the
trade should be exited. It is also possible that the price of the straddle or
strangle that the trader is short will rise without breaching key price levels,
as might occur when volatility levels are generally rising. In this case, the
trader should preset a stop-loss price on the structure itself, and exit the
trade when this price is breached.
TRADE MANAGEMENT
Remember: It is crucial to have a risk management strategy in place
before entering a trade!
If, in fact, it becomes clear that one’s forecast is incorrect, then it is time
to get out of the position—hopefully in an orderly fashion. This is usually
accomplished through the use of stop-loss orders, which were discussed in
Chapter 3. As a reminder, stop-loss orders are nonmarketable buy or sell
orders placed in the market that trigger if and when certain price conditions
are met, at which point they are turned into market orders. Traders usually
use stop-loss orders to close losing positions if key price levels are violated,
indicating an incorrect price forecast. There are several important issues to
consider when trading straddles and strangles. Long straddles and stran-
gles require different management from short straddles and strangles.
Long straddles and strangles:
• What is the most efficient way to take profits?
• How should poor timing be dealt with?
Short straddles and strangles:
• Where should stop-loss orders be placed?
• What should be done if the underlying isn’t moving but implied vol-
atility is rising?

122 Chapter 4 Straddles and Strangles
Long Straddles and Strangles
• Breakout
When a long straddle or strangle becomes profitable, meaning that
the large magnitude move the trader was forecasting occurs, it is im-
portant that he actively manages the long put or long call component of
the trade that moves into the money and attempt to squeeze the maximum
profitability out of that portion of the position. As with the collar and any
other long-option-containing position, this is usually accomplished by
“ rolling” the long option position along with the underlying by selling ver-
tical spreads. Rolling a long option position is an excellent way to manage a
position that is going as planned. As discussed in the previous chapter, rolling
accomplishes three important things:
• It maintains the investor’s exposure in the direction of the breakout.
• It reduces risk and takes “money off the table.”
• It puts the investor in a strong psychological position and increases
his “staying power.”
• Poor Timing
When trading a long straddle or strangle, it is important to not only
have the correct market view (large magnitude breakout or rising implied
volatility), but also to be fairly precise with timing. Because the long strad-
dle or strangle has negative time decay, the clock is the enemy and every
day that passes without the forecast movement is painful. Therefore, when
an investor is trading straddles and strangles from the long side, it is im-
portant that she set a time stop-loss (a date in the future beyond which she
will not carry the position) as well as a price stop-loss(a price below which
she will not carry the position). When either one of these stop-loss levels is
hit, the trader should exit the position.
Short Straddles and Strangles
• Breakout
Underlying movement is the enemy of the short straddle or strangle. If
the forecast of subdued or low magnitude movement is incorrect, one will
have to actively manage the short call or short put component of the posi-
tion in order to help manage risk.
• Rising Implied Volatility
Sometimes when trading a short straddle or strangle, a trader might
have the correct market view (subdued low-magnitude movement), but
the implied volatility of the options rises anyway, causing the value of the
straddle or strangle the trader is short to rise, creating losses. When implied
volatility rises, it is because other market participants foresee increased

volatility in the market place and begin pricing options accordingly. In the
long run, they may not necessarily be correct; but this is their view at the
time. Unfortunately, this situation creates near-term pain for one’s trade,
and it is difficult to know when this increase in implied volatility might
begin to subside, if ever. Therefore, when a trader trades straddles and
strangles from the short side, it is also important to set a stop-loss on the
straddle or strangle price itself,at a price above which he will not carry the
position. Even if the underlying stock or index is not moving, if this stop-
loss level is hit, the position should be exited.
RISK AND REWARD, THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH!
Straddles and strangles can be very seductive trading vehicles. Traders
with a weakness for the “long shot” can easily be blinded by the potential of
long straddles and strangles—they give the appearance of making money
in every direction and have unlimited profit potential. These traders tend
to fall in love with their delta and gamma numbers and usually overlook
the fact that they have to pay time decay and are exposed to declines in
implied volatility. After some time passes and their forecasts are proven in-
correct, they are left wondering where the money went. Traders looking for
a “sure thing” can become addicted to short straddles and strangles. Short
straddles and strangles profit from time decay, and what could be more
certain than time passing? These traders tend to fall in love with their theta
numbers and overlook the negative gamma or the unlimited risk aspects of
their positions. They count their time decay income day after day only to
see it all vanish when a large move takes place or implied volatility rises.
The bottom line is that there is no free lunch with straddles and strangles.
For every upside there is a downside, and the risks have to be understood,
factored into the forecast, and properly managed in a disciplined fashion if
one is to be successful trading straddles and strangles (or using any other
strategy).

CONCEPT REVIEW
Support level: Support is a price level or zone located below the
current market price where buyers become more willing to buy
and sellers are reluctant to sell.
Resistance level: Resistance is a price level or zone located above
the current market price where sellers become more willing to sell
and buyers are reluctant to buy.
Mean-reversion: The mean-reversion price or mean-reversion area
is the price or area that the underlying stock or index seems to
return to as it meanders in its trading range.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Butterflies and condors fit into the category of “directionless” strate-
gies. In terms of market view they are similar to straddles and strangles
in that the trader is not necessarily forecasting a particular direction in the
market, but rather a magnitude of movement. Butterflies and condors can
be traded from the long side or the short side, depending on the type of
movement that is expected in the underlying stock or index:
• Long butterflies and condors (Figures 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4) are used
when the trader is forecasting little or no directional movement or a
“trading range” in the underlying stock or index and he or she seeks
to profit from an increase in the overall value of the position due to
time decay or falling implied volatility.
• Short butterflies and condors are used when the trader is forecasting a
large magnitude move in either direction and he seeks to profit from
a decrease in the value of the overall position.

The similarities between butterflies and condors and straddles and
strangles are no accident. Long butterflies contain an embedded synthetic
short straddle wrapped by a synthetic long strangle. Long condors con-
tain an embedded short strangle wrapped by a synthetic long strangle
that is further out-of-the-money. This type of structure allows the properly
positioned long butterfly or condor to potentially profit from time decay
and/or falling implied volatility just as a short straddle or short strangle
would. The big difference is that the long strangle “wrap” of both struc-
tures limits the risk in the position, making it a more attractive “direction-
less” strategy for risk-averse traders.
Short butterflies contain an embedded synthetic long straddle
wrapped by a synthetic short strangle. Short condors contain an embed-
ded long strangle wrapped by a synthetic short strangle that is further
out-of-the-money. This type of structure allows the properly positioned

short butterfly or condor to potentially profit from sharp movement simi-
lar to a long straddle or long strangle would. The big difference is that the
short strangle “wrap” of both structures limits the profit potential in the
position (albeit with less exposure to time decay), making it a much less
attractive “large move” strategy. For this reason we will focus on the long
butterfly and long condor strategy in this book.
Long Butterflies and Condors
• The Long Butterfly
The long butterfly is a unique option strategy that can be used to ad-
dress a directionless market. The classic long butterfly is constructed using
three adjacent strikes, purchasing the lower strike option, selling two of the
middle strike options, and purchasing the higher strike option. The long
butterfly has several variations and can be constructed using calls, puts, or
a mixture of both. Figures 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 illustrate the three basic forms
of the long butterfly.

132 Chapter 5 Butterfl ies and Condors
Strike selection is very important when addressing the directionless
market with a long butterfly. The middle strike should be located in the
middle of the expected trading range. Placing the middle strike of the long
butterfly at-the-money creates a position that does not have a directional
bias and has a positive theta. Recall that at-the-money options have a higher
theta than away-from-the-money options, so even though a long butterfly
has an equal number of long and short options, locating themiddle strike
at-the-money gives the structure a positive theta.
• The Long Condor
A long condor is another limited-risk strategy that an investor can use
to trade in a directionless market. Condors usually are lumped into the
butterfly family because a condor is really just a variation of the butterfly.
(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:5)
A long condor has the same general “ 1/ 2/ 1” structure as the long
butterfly; the difference is that the two short contracts that make up the
“body” of the long condor are distributed over two strikes instead of one.
An investor could use a long condor when he expects a directionless
market with a wider trading range, or a trading range that seems to move
between strikes. The long condor also can be constructed using calls, puts,
or a mixture of both. Figures 5.8, 5.9, and 5.10 illustrate the three basic
forms of the long condor.

As with the long butterfly, the middle strikes should be located in the
middle of the expected trading range. Placing the middle strikes of the long
condor in the middle of the range creates a position that does not have a di-
rectional bias and has a positive theta. Stretching the “body” of the structure
over two strikes rather than one gives the trader a larger range of potential
profitabilitythat can help cover a wider trading range. But this extra cover-
age is not free: A condor typically is more expensive than a butterfly. The
extra premium spent buying a condor rather than a butterfly buys a larger
range of potential profitability, but maximum profit is decreased and maxi-
mum loss is increased by the amount of the premium spent.
Time Decay
If a market is directionless, hovering around the same prices every day or
floundering inside a trading range, the only thing really changing on a day-
to-day basis is the passage of time. The driving force behind a long butterfly
or condor strategy is time decay and/or declining implied volatility.The price
of an option has two components: intrinsic value and extrinsic value. Intrinsic
value is the amount by which an option is in-the-money. A call option is in-
the-money if the price of the underlying is above the strike price. A put option
is in-the-money if the price of the underlying is below the strike price. Any re-
maining value is extrinsic value. At-the-money options and out-of-the-money
options are composed entirely of extrinsic value. The amount of extrinsic value
in an option depends on many factors, including underlying price, interest
rates, dividends, time until expiration, and implied volatility. The more un-
certainty there is about the option’s possible value at expiration (in the case,
for example, of higher volatility and greater time to expiration), the greater
the extrinsic value of the option. Conversely, the more certainty there is about
an option’s value at expiration (in the case, for example, of lower volatility
and less time until expiration), the lower the extrinsic value of the option.
Theoretically, an option loses a portion of its extrinsic value every day,
and over time, an option will lose all of its extrinsic value. This is referred
to as time decay. Because of time decay, buyers of options theoretically lose
money every day, while sellers of options theoretically gain money every
day. Time decay is quantified by theta. If a long butterfly or condor is prop-
erly located around the trading range, the position will have positive time
decay or a positive theta and will theoretically increase in value with each
passing day. We will explore this further in the following section.

THE GREEKS OF LONG BUTTERFLIES
AND CONDORS
As mentioned in “Strategy Overview,” long butterflies and condors are
directionless strategies that seek to profit from time decay and/or the de-
cline of implied volatility as the market marks time by moving sideways.
Because of the structure of long butterflies and condors—short options in the
middle, or the “body,” and long options on the perimeter, or the “wings”—
the Greeks will be sensitive to the location of the underlying price versus
the strike prices of the position. When the underlying price is near the short
options of the body, the position will carry the characteristics of a short
option position—short gamma, short vega, and positive theta—which are
desirable characteristics if the underlying is moving in a trading range and
hovering around the short strike(s). When the underlying price is near the
long options of the wings, the position will carry the characteristics of a long
option position—long gamma, long vega, and negative theta—which are
undesirable characteristics if the underlying is moving in a trading range.
The Long Butterfly
• Delta
The delta of a long butterfly is dependent on the location of the under-
lying versus the strike. Because of the way it is structured, the long but-
terfly will have a positive delta when the underlying is below the middle
strike price and a negative delta when the underlying is above the middle
strike price; the delta will be approximately neutral when the underlying is
at the middle strike price. On an extreme move up or down, the delta will
eventually become neutral since the structure has limited risk.
The delta of a long butterfly is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas
of its component options. For example, the delta of the long 500/510/520
call butterfly would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
500 strike call delta 0.60
(cid:4)
510 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:4)
520 strike call delta 0.40

Long call butterfly delta (0.60 1) (0.50 2)
(cid:5) (cid:6)
(0.40 1) or 0.00
The delta of the long 500/510/520 put butterfly would be calculated as
follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
500 strike put delta 0.40
(cid:4)(cid:2)
510 strike put delta 0.50

Long iron butterfly delta ( 0.40 1) ( 0.50 1) (0.50 1)
(cid:5) (cid:6)
(0.40 1) or 0.00
Note how the deltas of all three versions of the long butterfly are the
same. This is because they are synthetically equivalent to one another. The
Greeks of the call, put, and iron butterflies of the same strikes and expira-
tion will always be identical.
Figure 5.11 shows that the delta of a long butterfly is positive when
the underlying is below the middle strike, negative when the underly-
ing is above the middle strike, and approximately neutral when it is
at the middle strike. This makes sense because the point of maximum
profitability of a long butterfly is at the middle strike. Also note the sen-
sitivity of the delta of the long butterfly to the amount of time left until
expiration. As expiration approaches, the delta of the long butterfly be-
comes much more sensitive to changes in the underlying price. Notice
the differences in the delta generated at various times until expiration
in Figure 5.11.

• Gamma
The gamma of a long butterfly is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the long
500/510/520 call butterfly would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
500 strike call gamma 0.05
(cid:4)
510 strike call gamma 0.10
(cid:4)
520 strike call gamma 0.06
(cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:2)
Long call butterfly gamma (0.05 1) (0.10 2)
(cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:2)
(0.06 1) or 0.09
(cid:2)
A gamma of 0.09 means that the delta of the overall position would
change against the traderby approximately 0.09 for every 1 point the un-
derlying moved. In other words, if the underlying moved up by 1 point,
the position would become 0.09 deltas shorter, and if the underlying
moved down by 1 point, the position would become 0.09 deltas longer.
Negative gamma positions always move against the trader. Obviously,
this is not a very desirable characteristic in a position, but there is a silver
lining as we will see when we examine theta. Gamma is greatly dependent
on the moneyness and the time to expiration. All things being equal, an
at-the-money option near expiration will have a greater gamma than an
at-the-money option with greater time left until expiration.
Figure 5.12 shows the dependency of the gamma of the long butterfly on
the location of the underlying and the time until expiration. When expiration

is near and the underlying price is close to the short options at the body, or
middle, strike price of the long butterfly, the position will have a large nega-
tive gamma. This reverses quickly as the underlying moves away from the
middle strike price into the area of the long wings of the outer strikes. When
there is greater time until expiration, the gamma curve is much softer.
• Vega
The vega of a long butterfly is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas of
its component options. For example, the vega of the long 500/510/520 call
butterfly would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
500 strike call vega 0.15
(cid:4)
510 strike call vega 0.20
(cid:4)
520 strike call vega 0.17
(cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:2)
Long call butterfly vega (0.15 1) (0.20 2)
(cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:2)
(0.17 1) or 0.08
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the
price of the long butterfly would change by approximately 0.08. Because
an at-the-money long butterfly is short vega, the value of the butterfly
will fall when implied volatility rises and rise when implied volatility falls.
Figure 5.13 illustrates the vega of a long butterfly.
(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:5)
Because of the 1/ 2/ 1 structure of the long butterfly, the position
will be short vega when the underlying price is near the short middle strike

and will reverse to being long vega when the underlying price is near the
long wing strikes. Recall from Chapter 1 that vega increases with time to
expiration so that, all things being equal, the vega of an option with a greater
amount of time left until expiration will be larger than that of an option with
a lesser amount of time left until expiration. Figure 5.13 clearly shows the
dependency of the vega of the butterfly on the location of the underlying
price and the time until expiration.
• Theta
The theta of a long butterfly is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas
of its component options. For example, the theta of the long 500/510/520
call butterfly would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)(cid:2)
500 strike call theta 0.02
(cid:4)(cid:2)
510 strike call theta 0.06
(cid:4)(cid:2)
520 strike call theta 0.03
(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:6)(cid:2)
Long call butterfly theta ( 0.02 1) ( 0.06 2)
(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:6)
( 0.03 1) or 0.07
This means that the value of an at-the-money long butterfly would
increase by approximately 0.07 per calendar day. Because an at-the-money
long butterfly has positive theta, the value of the at-the-money butterfly
will rise as time passes and option values decay. Figure 5.14 illustrates the
theta of a long butterfly.

==================================================

The Greeks of Long Butterfl ies and Condors 139
The long butterfly position will have positive theta when the underlying
price is near the short middle strike and will reverse to having negative theta
when the underlying price is near the long wing strikes. Recall that the theta
of an at-the-money option increasesas time to expiration decreases so that, all
things being equal, the theta of an at-the-money option with a lesser amount of
time until expiration will be greater than the theta of an at-the-money option
with a greater amount of time until expiration. This is apparent in Figure 5.14.
The Long Condor
Owing to similarities in their structure—long two outside strike op-
tions, short two inside strike options—the Greeks of the long condor are
similar to those of the long butterfly. However, because the two short op-
tions are located at two adjacent strikes rather than the same strike, there
are obvious differences.
• Delta
The delta of a long condor is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas of
its component options. For example, the delta of the long 500/510/520/530
call condor would be calculated as follows:
(cid:4)
500 strike call delta 0.60
(cid:4)
510 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:4)
520 strike call delta 0.40

Note how the deltas of all three versions of the long condor are the

Greeks of the call, put, and iron condors of the same strikes and expiration
will always be identical as seen in Figure 5.15.

Similar to the long butterfly, the delta of the long condor is positive
when the underlying is below the midpoint between the two inside strikes,
negative when the underlying is above the midpoint between the two in-
side strikes, and approximately neutral when the underlying is at the mid-
point between the two inside strikes. This makes sense because the point
of maximum profitability of a long condor is anywhere between the mid-
dle strikes. Once again, note the sensitivity of the delta of the long condor
to the amount of time left until expiration. As expiration approaches, the
delta of the long butterfly becomes much more sensitive to changes in the
underlying price.

(cid:2)
A gamma of 0.09 means that the delta of the overall position would
change against the trader by approximately 0.09 for every 1 point the
underlying moved. In other words, if the underlying moved up by 1 point,
the position would become 0.09 deltas shorter, and if the underlying moved
down by 1 point, the position would become 0.09 deltas longer. Negative
gamma positions always move against the trader. Gamma is greatly de-
pendent on the moneyness and the time to expiration. All things being
equal, an at-the-money option near expiration will have a greater gamma
than an at-the-money option with greater time left until expiration.
Figure 5.16 clearly shows the dependency of the gamma of the long con-
dor on the location of the underlying and the time until expiration. When
expiration is near and the underlying price is near the strikes of the short op-
tions of the long condor body, the position will have a large negative gamma.
This reverses quickly as the underlying moves away from the middle strike
price into the area of the long wings of the outer strikes. Once again when
there is greater time until expiration, the gamma curve softens.

• Vega
The vega of a long condor is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas of
its component options. For example, the vega of the long 500/510/520/530
call condor is calculated as follows:
(cid:4)

(cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:2)

This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the
price of the long condor would change by approximately $0.08. Because
an at-the-money long condor is short vega, the value of the condor will
fall when implied volatility rises and rise when implied volatility falls.

Because of the 1/ 1/ 1/ 1 structure of the long condor, the posi-
tion will be short vega when the underlying price is near the short middle
strikes and will reverse to being long vega when the underlying price is near
the long wing strikes. Figure 5.17 shows the dependency of the vega of the

by approximately 0.06 per calendar day. Because an at-the-money long condor
has positive theta, the value of the at-the-money condor will rise as time passes
and option values decay. Figure 5.18 illustrates the theta of a long condor.

to Expiration—Long April 42.50/47.50/52.50/57.50 Condor

Like the long butterfly, the long condor will have positive theta when
the underlying price is near the short middle strikes and will reverse to
having negative theta when the underlying price is near the long wing
strikes. Recall that the theta of an at-the-money option increases as time to
expiration decreases so that, all things being equal, the theta of an at-the-
money option with a lesser amount of time until expiration will be greater
than the theta of an at-the-money option with a greater amount of time

until expiration. This means that the theta of an at-the-money long condor
will increase over time. This is apparent in Figure 5.18.
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
Long butterflies and condors are strategies most often used to attempt
to profit from the underlying stock or index moving in a sideways, or direc-
tionless, fashion. As the underlying price meanders back and forth, mak-
ing no progress in either direction, time passes and the value of a properly
located long butterfly or condor theoretically will increase in value. The
key, therefore, is to locate directionless situations. This is sometimes easier
said than done, and there is no right or wrong way to go about identifying
directionless situations.
Identifying the Directionless Market
Directionless markets usually are identified by observing price action.
Technical analysis tools can be especially helpful in identifying a direction-
less stock or index. Bar charts, candlestick charts, point-and-figure charts,
and other types of graphic representation of price action over time are
helpful in finding directionless stocks or indices. The trader can employ
technical indicators, particularly “strength of trend” indicators to identify
situations where trend strength is low and a directionless market is likely
to persist. “Eyeballing” a price chart may be sufficient, but there are a few
basic concepts that should be understood.
Support and Resistance
Support and resistance levels represent price levels or zones where
supply (selling pressure) or demand (buying pressure) materializes and
halts rising or falling prices. Support and resistance levels can form within
uptrends, downtrends, or directionless markets.
• Support
Support is a price level or zone located below the current market price
where buyers become more willing to buy and sellers become more re-
luctant to sell. The buyers overwhelm the sellers in or near these zones,
forcing the price back up and preventing the price from falling below the
support level. Support levels or zones are determined by connecting reac-
tion lows, or “valleys,” of price action with a line. Obviously it takes at
least two reaction lows near the same price to form a support level, and the
more reaction lows that occur in this area, the “stronger” the support level
is seen to be. Figure 5.19 illustrates support levels.
• Resistance
Resistance is a price level or zone located above the current market
price where sellers become more willing to sell and buyers are reluctant to
buy. Sellers overwhelm buyers in or near these zones, forcing the price back
down and preventing the price from rising above resistance. Resistance

levels or zones are determined by connecting reaction highs, or “peaks,” of

this area, the “stronger” the resistance level is seen to be. Figure 5.20 illus-

The Trading Range Market
When the forces of supply and demand equalize, a stalemate occurs
and the market moves sideways between support and resistance levels un-
til one side can build up enough strength to finally overwhelm the other.
Visualize two opposing armies entrenched directly across the battlefield
from each other, neither having enough strength to break through the lines
of the other. Attacks by both sides on each other’s lines are easily repulsed,
and neither side moves. The stalemate persists until one side finally builds
up enough strength to break through the lines of the other. This is analo-
gous to the classic directionless market, as shown in Figure 5.21.

Important Factors
Regardless of which methods or tools the investor uses to identify the
directionless market, a trader must identify some important factors when
analyzing a stock or index if considering a directionless market option strat-
egy. Most important are the price levels involved. Support and resistance
levels need to be identified, along with the point or area to which price tends
to revert as it meanders up and down. These levels are of key importance for
selecting strikes when the investor constructs the strategy. It is also impor-
tant that the stock or index being analyzed appears likely to remain in the
directionless mode for a period of time that matches the time horizon of the
investor.
STRATEGY SELECTION
Regardless of how one arrives at a view of a directionless market (tech-
nical, fundamental, or other type of analysis), the following information
is necessary when selecting the strikes and expiration cycle for a long
butterfly or condor strategy:
• Support and resistance levels
• Mean-reversion price or area
• Projected time in the trading range
Support and Resistance Levels
Support and resistance levels (see the preceding section, “Investment
Objectives”) are needed to define the boundaries of the trading range. This
information is important for selecting the structure of one’s long butterfly
or condor. It is also important for risk management, as will be seen in the
next section, “Trade Management.”

                     PAGE 156                     
==================================================

Strategy Selection 147
Mean-Reversion Price or Area
The mean-reversion price, or mean-reversion area, is the price or area
that the underlying stock or index seems to return to as it meanders in its
trading range. This information is needed for structuring a long butterfly
or condor. Figure 5.22 is an example of a mean-reversion area.
Figure 5.22 Mean-Reversion Area of a Trading Range
Projected Time in the Trading Range
Like any trend, the directionless trend must end. It is important for the
trader to have a forecast of how long the directionless phase will last, to
select the expiration cycle of his long butterfly or condor.
Strike Selection
Support and resistance levels and the mean-reversion price (or area) are
needed for strike selection. It is important to cover the trading range with
the range of profitability(see “Strategy Composition”) of the long butterfly
or condor. If the underlying is moving sideways through a narrow range and
seems to revert to a particular price, and there is a strike price available at
that particular price, then one would want to construct a long butterfly posi-
tion with the body (the short middle strike) at that price. It is also important
to locate the wings (the long outer strikes) near the support and resistance
levels to limit risk in case of a breakout in the trading range. In Figure 5.23,
the underlying is moving sideways in a range between 97.50 (support) and
102.50 (resistance) with 100.00 seeming to be the mean-reversion point. In
this case a long 97.50/100/102.50 butterfly seems to make sense.
If the underlying is moving through a wider trading range and it seems
to return to a mean-reversion area or zone rather than a particular price, or
if strike prices do not match up well against important price levels, the strat-
egy may have to be “stretched” into a long condor (or even a pterodactyl) to
“fit” the range. In Figure 5.24, the underlying is moving sideways in a range

between 195.00 (support) and 210.00 (resistance) with the 200.00–205.00
zone seeming to be the mean-reversion area. In this case, a long butterfly
does not have a large enough range of profitability to cover this area. A long
195/200/205/210 condor would be a better selection.
Expiry Selection
To select the expiration month, the trader must forecast the projected
time the underlying will be in the trading range. If the trader is estimating
that the trading range will persist for thirty days, then he or she would need
to use options that expire before that time. If he is forecasting a trading
range that will persist for some time, which expiration should he choose?
Long butterflies and condors made up of shorter-dated options will bear
fruit more quickly than their longer-dated cousins (assuming the trader is
correct about the trading range), but they are also more risky because they
cost more. If, for example, one’s forecast is for the trading range to persist
for ninety days, it might be better to use a blend of the expirations occurring
in that time period.

Trade Management 149
TRADE MANAGEMENT
One of the reasons long butterflies and condors are popular strategies for
taking a short volatility position to reflect the directionless market view is
that they are limited-risk positions. Recall from “Strategy Overview” that a
long butterfly is synthetically a short straddle with a long strangle wrap and
that a long condor is synthetically a short strangle with a long strangle wrap
that is further out-of-the-money. It is the synthetic long strangle wraps that
make these positions limited-risk positions. If the underlying moves outside
of the long wing strike, the long option “kicks in” to limit risk. With a long
butterfly or condor, one can take a short volatility position and not worry
about waking up splattered against the wall by a market-moving event.
The fact that long butterflies and condor positions have limited risk
makes things a little easier from the risk management standpoint, but the
position must still be managed. Points to consider:
• What is the most efficient way to take potential profits?
• What if the trading range begins to widen?
• What if the trading range narrows?
• How should one manage risk and/or take losses?
Taking Profits
Discipline, discipline, discipline . . . One of the biggest concerns in manag-
ing positions with positive time decay is knowing when to leave the party.
Because a properly located long butterfly or condor (one where the underly-
ing is hovering near the short strike(s) of the body) will theoretically increase
in value every day, the temptation to try to get “one more day, just one more
day” of time decay is always there. Inevitably, in trying to capture 0.10 worth
of time decay by holding the position “just one more day,” the trader loses
$3.00 worth of accumulated profits when the underlying breaks out of the
range and goes on a directional tear. Here are some important tips:
• Take Partial Profits
If an investor is fortunate enough to have a profitable long butterfly
or condor position, he can consider taking partial profits occasionally by
scaling out of the trade. For example, if a position consists of ten long but-
terflies, the investor should not be afraid to take profits on two here and
two there. He can slowly scale out of the position as it goes in his favor.
This action results in profits and limits the remaining risk.
• Watch Market Action
Remember the reason the investor got into this trade in the first place:
He had a market forecast of sideways behavior and/or declining implied
volatility. If the underlying stock or index in which he has the position
starts to behave as though this trend may end, he should get out!

==================================================

150 Chapter 5 Butterfl ies and Condors
• Use Your Head
As a corollary to the above, don’t be foolish and take a long butterfly or
condor into a situation that might lead to a breakout or a pickup in volatility—
earnings, government reports, and so on—unless it is part of the game plan.
• Use Synthetics to Exit
Again, long butterflies and condors have synthetic components—a long
butterfly is synthetically a short straddle with a long strangle wrap, and a long
condor is synthetically a short strangle with a long strangle wrap that is further
out-of-the-money. Use this knowledge to exit the trade in a clever fashion.
For example, an investor has been long a butterfly and has been fortu-
nate that his forecast of sideways movement about his short strike was cor-
rect. Now he would like to take profits because he feels that the climate may
be changing and volatility might pick up. He decides that a clever choice is
to cover the synthetic short straddle at the inside strikes by buying back the
actual straddle, leaving him with a long, low-cost synthetic long strangle at
the outside strikes. Figures 5.25, 5.26, and 5.27 illustrate this procedure:

Trade Management 151
synthetically equivalent to a long 100 put; that combined with an existing
long 110 call yields a synthetic long 100/110 strangle.
Modifying to Fit the Trading Range
What if the forecast of a directionless market was correct but the inves-
tor happened to choose the wrong strikes or the trading range happens to
be wider or narrower than his initial forecast? In these cases it is possible to
modify an existing long butterfly or condor position by adding or subtract-
ing additional butterflies to widen or narrow the position to fit the new
range. For example, although a trader correctly forecasted a directionless
market, he structured his long butterfly position so that the short strike was
105.00, but the underlying seemed to be trading between 105.00 and 110.00,
rather than reverting to 105.00 as the trader had forecasted. He decided
to purchase an additional butterfly to “roll” his long butterfly into a long
condor, giving him additional range coverage. Figures 5.28, 5.29, and 5.30
illustrate this procedure.

152 Chapter 5 Butterfl ies and Condors
The result in Figure 5.30 is a long 100/105/110/115 condor. If the trading
range had moved lower than the projected trading range, the trader would
have needed to purchase an additional butterfly at the lower strikes. Even
though the above example uses calls, the same procedure can be used with
put or iron butterflies, since they are all synthetically equivalent.
As another example, let’s say that the forecast of a directionless market
was correct and the trader’s purchase of the 100/105/110/115 put condor has
paid off. Now the underlying seems to be “homing in” on the 105 strike.
The trader decides to use this as an opportunity to take some money off the
table by selling the embedded 105/110/115 put butterfly out of his condor
and leaving him long the 100/105/110 put butterfly. Figures 5.31, 5.32, and
5.33 illustrate this procedure.

==================================================

Chapter 5 Exercise 153
The result in Figure 5.33 is a long 100/105/110 put butterfly. The act of
selling a higher strike put butterfly out of the condor takes money off the
table and rolls the position into a long butterfly at the lower three strikes.
If the underlying had homed in on the 110 strike rather than the 105 strike,
the trader would have had to sell the 100/105/110 put butterfly to roll the
position up instead. Even though the preceding example uses puts, the
same procedure can be used with call or iron condors, since they are all
synthetically equivalent.
Managing Risk and Taking Losses
As soon as the price action proves the forecast for a directionless market
to be incorrect by breaking through a key support or resistance level, one
needs to exit the trade. This is why support and resistance levels—or some
method for choosing boundaries for a long butterfly or condor trade—are so
important. They are needed for structuring purposes, but also for risk man-
agement purposes. Support or resistance levels or boundaries need to be the
“lines in the sand.” If the underlying moves outside these levels, the forecast
is incorrect and one needs to exit the trade, as shown in Figure 5.34.

CONCEPT REVIEW
Term structure: Implied volatility levels generally differ for different
expiration cycles.
Jelly roll: A long jelly roll is composed of a long call time spread
and a short put time spread; a short jelly roll is the combination of
a short call time spread and a long put time spread.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Calendar spreads employ options of the same class but with different
expiration cycles to capture specific market scenarios. Calendar spreads
break down into two general categories: horizontal calendar spreads ( often
called time spreads) and diagonal calendar spreads. Horizontal calendar
spreads are composed of options of the same class and strike price but
with different expirations; diagonal calendar spreads are composed of
options of the same class, but with different strike prices and different
expirations. Calendar spreads are wonderfully complex and can be used
to capture a number of different market scenarios depending on how they
are constructed. We will introduce only horizontal calendar spreads in this
chapter. Horizontal calendar spreads (time spreads):
• Can be composed of calls or puts
• Can be long or short
• Can have a bullish or bearish bias
• Can have a sideways bias
• Can have a movement bias (large move in either direction) (Figures 6.1
and6.2)

A horizontal calendar spread involves the simultaneous purchase and
sale of options of the same class (calls or puts) and strike prices, but with
different expiration cycles. Depending on which strike and expiration is
purchased and which strike and expiration is sold, the time spread can
have a bullish, bearish, neutral, or movement bias (large move in either
direction).
Naming Conventions
Time spread terminology can be confusing because these spreads can
be composed of calls or puts of a variety of expiration cycles. To keep it
straight, keep the concept of buying and selling time in mind. If one buys
a call or put of a longer-dated expiration than the call or put that is sold,

A long time spread is composed of a long option of a particular class,
strike, and expiration and a short option of the same class and strike but of
an expiration of a shorter duration. Figure 6.3 illustrates the structure of a

Time Spread Strategy
Because time spreads consist of an equal number of calls or puts pur-
chased and sold—that is, the ratio is always one long call to each short
call or one long put to each short put—the structures have limited risk
and limited return. Long-dated options generally are more expensive than
shorter-dated options of the same class and strike (the exception usually
being deep-in-the-money put options). Therefore, buying a time spread re-
sults in a debit and selling a time spread usually results in a credit. The risk
to the buyer is limited to the initial debit; the risk to the seller is limited to
the difference in the price of the two options at the expiration of the short-
dated option. The amount of this risk cannot be quantified at the outset of
the trade.
The buyer of the time spread wants the value of the spread to expand in
price; the seller of the time spread wants the value of the spread to contract
in price. As was seen is “Strategy Composition,” the point of maximum
value of a time spread is when the underlying price is at the strike, of the
short-dated option on expiration. This is the price/time target of the time
spread buyer. The value of the time spread contracts as the underlying
price moves away from the strike price. This is the price target of the time
spread seller—as far away from the strike as possible. The strategies avail-
able to buyers and sellers of time spreads break down into the following:
• Long time spreads
— Bullish
— Bearish
— Neutral
• Short time spreads
— Large move away from the strike, in either direction
Because the long time spread reaches its point of maximum profitabil-
ity at the strike, at expiration it can structured to be bullish, bearish, or neu-
tral, depending on where the strike price of the time spread is located in
relation to the current underlying price. If the strike of a long time spread
is above the current underlying price, it has a bullish bias; if it is below
the current underlying price, it has a bearish bias; and if it is equal to the
current underlying price, it is neutral.

==================================================

162 Chapter 6 Calendar Spreads
The seller of a time spread wants the underlying price to move away
from the strike in any direction, which generally causes the value of the
spread to contract. So, technically, a short time spread also can be bullish
or bearish. Keeping in mind that the seller of a time spread wants the un-
derlying price to move as far away from the strike as possible, a short time
spread with a strike above the current underlying price is bearish; the seller
would like the underlying price to continue to move down, away from the
strike. A short time spread with a strike below the current underlying price
is bullish; the seller would like the underlying price to continue to move
up, away from the strike.
THE GREEKS OF THE TIME SPREAD
Now would be a great time to refer back to Chapter 1 to review the
Greeks, and especially the way the delta, gamma, vega, and theta of an o ption
change over time. Time spreads, being composed of long and short option
positions in different expiration months, have unique sensitivities that basi-
cally amount to the differences in option sensitivity to changes in market
conditions over time. These differences can be exploited to capture certain
market scenarios; however, they can be difficult to visualize, even with the
help of graphics. Getting familiar with how the Greeks of an option “age”
over time will help in understanding the workings of the time spread.
Long Time Spreads
• Delta
The delta of a long time spread is the difference between the deltas of
the long-dated option and the short-dated option. For example, the delta of
(cid:2)
the long XYZ (t n, t) 100 call time spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:3)
(t) closest month
(cid:2) (cid:3)
(t n) farther-out month
(cid:2) (cid:3)
long XYZ(t n) 100 call delta 0.55
(cid:3)
short XYZ t 100 call delta 0.50
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4)
long XYZ (t n, t) 100 call time spread delta 0.55 0.50 or 0.05
Remember that puts have a negative delta, so the delta of the long XYZ
(cid:2)
(t n, t) 100 put time spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)
long XYZ(t n) 100 put delta 0.45
(cid:3)(cid:4)
short XYZ t 100 put delta 0.50
(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)
long XYZ (t n, t) 100 put time spread delta 0.45 ( 0.50) or 0.05
Recall that the point of maximum profitability of a long time spread is
when the underlying price is at the strike, at expiration.Therefore, it makes
sense that the delta of a long time spread is positive when the underlying

price is below the strike price and negative when the underlying price is
above the strike price. This is evident in Figures 6.7 and 6.8.
What also can be seen in Figures 6.7 and 6.8 is that the delta of the long
call time spread becomes increasingly sensitive as expiration approaches.
Recall that the delta of a short-dated option is much more sensitive to

“moneyness” (the location of the underlying price relative to the strike
price) than that of a long-dated option. In other words, short-dated at-the-
money options have a greater gamma than longer-dated at-the-money op-
tions. Therefore, the long time spread will have negative gamma when the
underlying price is near the strike price. This means that as the underlying
price moves away from the strike price, the delta of the short-dated op-
tion will change faster than the delta of the long-dated option, generating
a long delta when the underlying price drops below the strike price and a
short delta when the underlying price rises above the strike price. In the
May 10, 2008, series shown in Figures 6.7 and 6.8, the rate of change of the
delta near the strike price is much greater than that of the other series.
Long Call Time Spread vs. Long Put Time Spread
You may have noticed a remarkable similarity between Figure 6.7, the
delta of a long call time spread, and Figure 6.8, the delta of a long put time
spread. In fact, they are identical. The long call time spread of a particular
strike and set of expirations is synthetically equivalent to the long put time
spread of the same strike and set of expirations. Much like call and put ver-
tical spreads, call and put time spreads are linked by a neutral interest-rate-
driven structure called the jelly roll. We will discuss this later in the chapter,
but it suffices to say that the delta, gamma, theta, and vega of call and put
time spreads (which have the same underlyings, same strikes, same set of
expirations) are identical. Going forward, we will be exploring the Greeks
of the generic “long time spread.”
• Gamma
The gamma (the rate of change of the delta) of a long time spread is the
sum of the position-adjusted gammas of its component options. Recall from
Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a positive gamma while a
short option position will have a negative gamma. So, in the case of the long
time spread, the long-dated option will generate positive gamma while the
short-dated option will generate negative gamma. For example, the gamma
(cid:2)
of the long XYZ (t n, t) 100 time spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2) (cid:3)
long XYZ(t n) 100 gamma 0.05
(cid:3)
short XYZ t 100 gamma 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:4)
long XYZ (t n, t) 100 time spread gamma 0.05 0.10 or 0.05
The gamma of a long time spread is negative when the underlying
price is at or around the strike price because the short-dated option has a
larger gamma than the long-dated option. However, the gamma curve of
the short-dated option has greater convexity than that of the long-dated
option, so if the underlying price moves far enough away from the strike
price, the gamma of the long time spread will flip back to positive as illus-
trated in Figure 6.9.
As can be seen in the May 10, 2008, data series in the following figure,
the gamma of the long time spread is negative when the underlying price

Figure 6.9 Long Time Spread Gamma vs. Time to Expiration—Long XYZ

is near the strike price. When the expiration of the short-dated option is
near and the gamma of the short-dated option is very high (the May 500
time spread in this case), the gamma of the time spread can be very nega-
tive. As always, this is less pronounced when there is greater time until the
expiration of the first option, as can be seen with the April 20, 2008, and the
April 25, 2008, data series in Figure 6.9.
• Vega
The vega (the sensitivity to changes in implied volatility) of a long time
spread is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas of its component options.
R ecall from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a positive vega while
a short option position will have a negative vega, and that a long-dated option
will have a larger vega than a shorter-dated option of the same strike. The vega
(cid:2)
of the long XYZ (t n, t) 100 time spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2) (cid:3)
long XYZ(t n) 100 vega 0.15
(cid:3)
short XYZ t 100 vega 0.08
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4)
long XYZ (t n, t) 100 time spread vega 0.15 0.08 or 0.07
As can be seen in Figure 6.10, the vega of the long time spread is posi-
tive, with the magnitude dependent on the time differential between the
expiration of the two component options and the time until expiration of
the short-dated option. The vega of an option diminishes as the expiration
approaches, so the vega of the long time spread generally will rise as the
expiration of the short-dated option approaches.

• Theta
The theta (the sensitivity to the passage of time) of a long time spread
is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas of its component options. Recall
from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a negative theta while
a short option position will have a positive theta and that a short-dated
at-the-money option will have a larger theta than a longer-dated at-the-
(cid:2)
money option of the same strike. The theta of the long XYZ (t n, t) 100
time spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)
long XYZ(t n) 100 theta 0.06
(cid:3)(cid:4)
short XYZ t 100 theta 0.13
(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)
long XYZ (t n, t) 100 time spread theta 0.06 ( 0.13) or 0.07
This means that the value of the time spread would theoretically expand
by approximately 0.07 per day, all else being equal. Of course, the theta of
the long time spread also is dependent on the location of the underlying
relative to strike prices, time left until expiration, implied volatility levels,
and other factors. Figure 6.11 illustrates the theta of the long time spread.
As can be seen in the following figures, and like the other Greeks, the theta
of the long time spread is greatly dependent on the location of the underlying
and the time until expiration. Notice that the theta of the position is positive
when the underlying price is near the strike price, but if the underlying price
moves far enough away from the strike price in either direction, the theta of
the long time spread can become negative. Like the gamma, the theta of an
at-the-money option increases rapidly as expiration approaches and the theta
of a long time spread will generally increase as expiration approaches.

Short Time Spreads
Given that the Greeks of the short time spread are the exact opposite of
those of the long time spread, the following examples may seem repetitive,
but the Greeks of time spreads can be difficult, so more review is better
than less review in this case.
• Delta
The delta of a short time spread is the difference between the deltas of the
short-dated option and the long-dated option. For example, the delta of the
(cid:2)
short XYZ (t, t n) 100 call time spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:3)
long XYZ t 100 call delta 0.50
(cid:2) (cid:3)
short XYZ(t n) 100 call delta 0.55
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:4)
short XYZ (t, t n) 100 call time spread delta 0.50 0.55 or 0.05
Puts have a negative delta, so the calculation of the delta of the short XYZ
(cid:2)
(t, t n)100 put time spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:3)(cid:4)
long XYZ t 100 put delta 0.50
(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)
short XYZ(t n) 100 put delta 0.45
(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)
short XYZ (t, t n) 100 put time spread delta 0.50 ( 0.45) or 0.05
Recall that the point of maximum loss of a short time spread is when
the underlying price is at the strike, at expiration. Therefore, it makes sense

that the delta of a short time spread is negative when the underlying price
is below the strike price and positive when the underlying price is above
the strike price. With a short time spread, one would like the underlying
price to move away from the strike price as quickly as possible. One does
not want the underlying price to return to the strike price. Figures 6.12 and
6.13 illustrate this.

==================================================

The Greeks of the Time Spread 169
Notice in Figures 6.12 and 6.13 that the deltas of the short call time
spread and the short put time spread (same strikes, same set of expira-
tions) are identical. This is because the call and the put time spreads are
synthetically equivalent, and again, we will discuss the relationship of
call time spreads and put time spreads later in the chapter. Notice also
that the delta of the short call time spread becomes increasingly sensitive
as expiration approaches. Recall that the delta of a short-dated option is
much more sensitive to moneyness than that of a long-dated option. In
other words, short-dated at-the-money options have a greater gamma
than longer-dated at-the-money options, and therefore the short time
spread will have a positive gamma when the underlying price is near
the strike price.
This means that as the underlying price moves away from the strike
price, the delta of the short-dated option will change faster than the delta
of the long-dated option, generating a long delta when the underlying
price rises above the strike price and a short delta when the underlying
price drops below the strike price. In the May 11, 2008, series shown in
Figures 6.12 and 6.13, the rate of change of the delta near the strike price is
much greater than it is with the other series.
• Gamma
The gamma (the rate of change of the delta) of a short time spread is
the sum of the position-adjusted gammas of its component options. Recall
from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a positive gamma
while a short option position will have a negative gamma. So, in the case
of the short time spread, the long-dated option will generate a negative
gamma while the short-dated option will generate a positive gamma. For
(cid:2)
example, the gamma of the short XYZ (t, t n) 100 time spread would be
calculated as follows:
(cid:3)
long XYZ t 100 gamma 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:3)
short XYZ(t n) 100 gamma 0.05
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2)
long XYZ (t, t n) 100 time spread gamma 0.10 0.05 or 0.05
The gamma of a short time spread is positive when the underlying
price is at or around the strike price because the short-dated option has a
larger gamma than the long-dated option. However, the gamma curve of
the short-dated option has greater convexity than that of the long-dated
option, so if the underlying price moves far enough away from the strike
price, the gamma of the short time spread will flip back to negative as
illustrated in Figure 6.14.
As can be seen from the May 11, 2008, data series in Figure 6.14, the
gamma of the short time spread is positive when the underlying price
is near the strike price. When the expiration of the short-dated option is
near and the gamma of the short-dated option is very high (the May 500
time spread in this case), the gamma of the short time spread can be very
positive. As always, this is less pronounced when there is greater time
until the expiration of the first option, as can be seen with the April 11,
2008, and the April 26, 2008, data series.

• Vega
The vega (the sensitivity to changes in implied volatility) of a short
time spread is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas of its component
options. Recall from Chapter 1 that a long option positionwill have a posi-
tive vega while a short option position will have a negative vega and that
a long-dated option will have a larger vega than a shorter-dated option of
(cid:2)
the same strike. The vega of the short XYZ (t, t n) 100 time spread would
be calculated as follows:
(cid:3)
long XYZ t 100 vega 0.08
(cid:2) (cid:3)
short XYZ(t n) 100 vega 0.15
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:4)
short XYZ (t, t n) 100 time spread vega 0.08 0.15 or 0.07
Figure 6.15 illustrates the vega of the short time spread.
As can be seen in the preceding figure, the vega of the short time spread
is negative, with the magnitude dependent on the time differential between
the expiration of the two component options and the time until expiration
of the short-dated option. The vega of an option diminishes as the expira-
tion approaches, so the vega of the short time spread will generally fall as
the expiration of the short-dated option approaches.
• Theta

is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas of its component options. Recall

from Chapter 1 that a long option position will have a negative theta while
a short option position will have a positive theta and that a short-dated
at-the-money option will have a larger theta than a longer-dated at-the-
money option of the same strike. The theta of a short time spread with the
underlying price at or near the strike is negative. The theta of the short XYZ

This means that the value of the time spread would theoretically ex-
pand by approximately 0.07 per day, all else being equal (a loss to a trader
short the time spread). The theta of the short time spread is also dependent
on the location of the underlying relative to strike prices, time left until ex-
piration, implied volatility levels, and other factors. Figure 6.16 illustrates
the theta of the short time spread.
In the following figure, the theta of the short time spread is highly nega-
tive when the underlying price is near the strike price, but if the underlying
price moves far enough away from the strike price in either direction, the
theta of the long time spread can become positive. The theta of the short-
dated at-the-money option increases rapidly as expiration approaches, and
therefore the time decay of the short time spread will generally increase as
the expiration approaches.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
As mentioned in “Strategy Overview,” time spreads can be used in a
variety of situations. Depending on the location of the strike price versus
the current underlying price, and whether the time spread is long or short,
time spreads can be used as directional strategies or they can be used as di-
rectionless strategies. They can be used for high-velocity, high-magnitude
directional movement, or for slow sideways movement. They can also be
used to target extreme differences in implied volatility between two expi-
ration months. Because of the unique sensitivities of an intermonth long/
short option combination, long and short time spreads (Figure 6.17)can be
deployed to fit very specific market forecasts. Price, implied and timing
factors all can be built into a single strategy. To recap:

• Long Time Spreads
• Negative gamma, positive vega, positive theta
— Sideways trade; rising implied volatility
— Directional move toward a target price
• Short Time Spreads
• Positive gamma, negative vega, negative theta
— Sharp movement away from the strike; falling implied volatility
• Either Time Spread
• Address large implied volatility differentials.
Sideways Trade
The long time spread can be used to address the underlying that is mov-
ing in a sideways or directionless fashion. Because the long time spread
has a positive theta (a positive time decay), the value of an at-the-money
long time spread should rise as the underlying price hovers near the strike
price of the spread. Should the underlying price break out in either direc-
tion, risk is limited to the initial cost of the spread. Because the long time
spread is also long vega, it can be a good choice for a forecast of sideways
movement in the market or a particular underlying where implied volatil-
ity levels are already low.
Directional Moves Toward a Target Price
Long time spreads can be used as a directional strategy. If one’s forecast
is for the market to move to a certain price point in a certain time frame, an
effective strategy can be a long time spread structured at the strike nearest
the target price, with the short-dated option expiring at the time the trader
expects the underlying to “arrive” at that price. A long time spread with a
strike above the current underlying price is bullish because it is desirable
for the underlying price to move up to that particular strike. A long time
spread with a strike below the current underlying price is bearish because
it is desirable for the underlying price to move down to that particular
strike. Again, because the long time spread is long vega, it can be a good
choice for a directional strategy when implied volatility levels are low.
Sharp Move Away from the Strike
The short time spread can be used to be a directionless “breakout”
strategy. Sharp movement away from the strike causes the value of the
time spread to decline. The short time spread is long gamma, meaning that
movement in any direction away from the strike price will cause a change
in the delta of the overall spread that is favorable to the trader. If the
underlying price moves up away from the strike, the position will become

long delta; if the underlying price moves down away from the strike, the
position will become short delta (refer again to Figures 6.12 and 6.13). This
behavior is similar to a long straddle or long strangle, but unlike the long
straddle and strangle, the short time spread is short vega, so if the forecast
also includes declining implied volatility after the breakout (this sometimes
occurs after government reports are issued), or if overall implied volatility
levels are already high, the short time spread might be a better choice than
a long straddle or strangle for trading a breakout forecast.
Implied Volatility Differentials
Implied volatility is the options market’s consensus about a particular
underlying stock’s expected volatility through the expiration date of the
options. Implied volatility levels change constantly in response to the buy-
ers and sellers of options entering and exiting the market in response to
events and nonevents. Because there are different expectations associated
with different expiration cycles and with the estimated volatility likely to
occur during a particular time period, implied volatility levels generally
differ for different expiration cycles. This is referred to as the term struc-
ture of implied volatility. The implied volatility of short-dated options will
conform to short-term events, spiking when underlying price movement
is volatile, collapsing when it is not, whereas the longer-dated options will
trade more in line with the historical long-term volatility. This means that
the term structure of implied volatility can show a great deal of variance,
and this sometimes leads to opportunity for the time spreader. Figure 6.18
is an example of the term structure of implied volatility after a recent low
volatility period.

Figure 6.18 Term Structure of Implied Volatility—Recent Low Volatility
Figure 6.18 charts implied volatility levels over expiration dates. In this
case, implied volatility is lower in the near-term expiration months than
in the longer-term expiration months, which is indicative of an underly-
ing that has been going through a “slow period” where short-term volatil-
ity has underperformed the mean long-term volatility. Figure 6.19 is an

example of what the term structure of implied volatility might look like if
the underlying has gone through a recent period of high volatility.
The fluctuations in the term structure of implied volatility, as shown
in Figures 6.18 and 6.19, can be incorporated into time spread strategies.
The term structure of implied volatility of a stock that has gone through a
recent slow period, such as the one in Figure 6.18, would favor a short time
spread strategy, because one would be purchasing the short-dated option
at a lower implied volatility than the long-dated option that is being sold.
The term structure of a stock that has gone through a recent volatile period,
such as the one shown in Figure 6.19, would favor a long time spread strat-
egy, since one would be purchasing the long-dated option at an implied
volatility that is lower than that of the short-dated option that is being sold.
Although term structure is important and can add to (or subtract from)
the quality of one’s time spread strategy, it is not necessarily enough to
warrant a trade in and of itself. It is important that one’s forecast for price
movement (or nonmovement as the case may be) also justifies the selected
time spread strategy.
STRATEGY COMPONENT SELECTION
So how should one structure his or her time spread strategy? There are
many variables involved:
• What is one’s current market forecast?
— Bullish
— Bearish
— Neutral
— Breakout

• What is the time horizon of the forecast move?
— Determine when you expect the target price to be reached.
• What is the term structure of implied volatility?
What Is One’s Current Market Forecast?
Bullish, bearish, neutral, or breakout. There may be a time spread po-
sition to address each one of these forecasts. A bullish forecast might call
for a long time spread at a strike price above the current underlying price,
while a bearish forecast might call for a long time spread at a strike price
below the current underlying price. A neutral forecast might call for a long
time spread at a strike that corresponds to the current market price, and a
forecast of breakout in either direction might call for a short time spread at
a strike that corresponds to the current market price.
What Are the Magnitude and Time Horizon
of the Forecast Move?
For structuring purposes, it is important for the investor to have an
idea of a target price—where she thinks the underlying is likely to go if
her bullish or bearish forecast is correct—and the time horizon over which
she thinks the move will take place. Both factors are important because, as
we saw in “Strategy Composition,” the point of maximum profitability of
a long time spread is at the strike price, at the expiration of the short-dated
option. Ideally, the investor would like the underlying price to move to this
strike price at or near expiration to capture the maximum amount of profit.
Example
The trader believes ABC is set to move from the 100.00 level to the 90.00
level over the next thirty days. What strikes should he or she incorporate
into a bearish long time spread strategy to target an optimal potential re-
turn on this move?
• Answer
Her strategy could be long a time spread at the 90.00 strike, with a
short-dated option at the expiration closest to the trader’s forecast thirty-
day time horizon.
What Is the Term Structure of Implied Volatility?
Obviously, this will play a large part in time spread strategy selec-
tion. If the current term structure of implied volatility is in alignment with
one’s price/time forecast for the underlying it can be the deciding factor for
choosing a time spread over another strategy. If the current term structure

of implied volatility is in opposition to one’s forecast, it can force one into
a strategy other than a time spread.
Example 1
The investor believes that GHF is about to move from 100.00 to 110.00
and would like to capture this move with a limited-risk options strategy.
After careful examination of the term structure of implied volatility, he no-
tices that the implied volatilities of short-dated options are very depressed
relative to long-dated options. This eliminates a bullish long time spread
from consideration.
Example 2
The investor believes HIJ is going to move up from 120.00 to 130.00 in
the next thirty days, and would like to capture this move with a limited-risk
options strategy. After careful examination of the term structure of implied
volatility, she notices that the implied volatility of the options expiring in
thirty days are very elevated compared to the implied volatility of the op-
tions expiring in ninety days. Based on this, she decides to implement a
long time spread, buying the ninety-day option and selling the thirty-day
option at the 130.00 strike.
At the Point of Execution: Call Time Spread
or Put Time Spread?
• Pricing Anomalies
As we mentioned earlier in our examination of the Greeks of time spreads,
long call and put time spreads and short call and put time spreads (having
the same underlyings, strike prices, and expirations) are synthetically equiv-
alent to one another. They have identical sensitivities and risk-reward char-
acteristics; the only difference is price. Call time spreads usually are more
expensive than the put time spreads of the same strikes and expirations. As
usual, this difference comes down to cash flows and carrying costs.
Option prices are based on the theoretical forward price of the underly-
ing instrument corresponding to their particular expiration date. The for-
ward price of a stock is equivalent to the spot price plus financing costs
(minus discounted dividends, if any). This means that, in general, the for-
ward price of a stock rises over time, and therefore the forward price used
to calculate option values will be (absent large dividends) progressively
higher with each expiration month. When the strike price is factored into
the equation, the result is a cost of carry differential from one expiration
month to the next, and this interest rate differential is captured in a struc-
ture commonly known as the jelly roll.
• The Jelly Roll
A jelly roll is composed of a long time spread and a short time spread,
one composed of puts, the other of calls, having the same strikes and

• Jelly Roll Value
The jelly roll is a neutral structure with an interest-rate component. It has
no delta, no gamma, no theta, and no vega—it can’t because it is composed
of offsetting positions in two synthetically equivalent spreads: long time
(cid:2) (cid:3)
spread short time spread neutral. It does, however, have an interest-rate
component, and it is this component that explains the difference in pricing
between call and put time spreads. Absent any early exercise situations, the
value of a jelly roll should always equal the cost of carry differential of the
expirations, adjusted by the strike price:

This value is embedded into the price differential of the call time spread
and the put time spread; that is, the call time spread is worth $0.50 more than
the put time spread. Another way to look at the relationship is as follows:
(cid:4) (cid:3)
Call time spread (CTS) Put time spread (PTS) Jelly roll value (JR)
or
(cid:4) (cid:3)
CTS PTS JR
This means that the value of the call time spread should always exceed
the value of the put time spread by the value of the jelly roll. Buying the put
time spread for less than the call time spread does not save money unless
(cid:4)
one is buying it for less than CTS JR. Selling the call time spread for more
than the put time spread does not make a great sale, unless one is selling it
(cid:2)
for more than PTS JR.
• Practical Uses
When it comes time to “pull the trigger” on a call or put time spread,
whether at the point of entry or exit, we can evaluate which structure is a
better trade by incorporating the jelly roll formula into the evaluation pro-
(cid:4) (cid:3)
cess. Remember: CTS PTS JR. If the equation does not balance, there
may be a relative advantage available.
Example
An investor decides market conditions in XYZ call for a long time
spread. He decides to buy a sixty-day option and sell a twenty-eight-day
option at the 50 strike. Interest rates are 5 percent.
You receive the following quotes:
(cid:4)
Call time spread: $1.25 $1.35
(cid:4)
Put time spread: $1.15 $1.20
Which time spread offer represents the best value?

You can then evaluate the offers:
(cid:4) (cid:3)
CTS PTS JR
(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:2)
1.35 1.20 0.15; less than the 0.22 value of the jelly roll
Therefore, the call time spread is theoretically underpriced and repre-
sents a better potential value when buying a time spread.
Here are some easier and faster shortcuts:
Long time spread rules:
• If the call time spread ask minus the put time spread ask is
greater than the value of the jelly roll, the put time spread appears
cheap.
• If the call time spread ask minus the put time spread ask is less than
the value of the jelly roll, the call time spread appears cheap.
Short time spread rules:
• If the call time spread bid minus the put time spread bid is greater
than the value of the jelly roll, the call time spread appears rich.
• If the call time spread bid minus the put time spread bid is less than
the value of the jelly roll, the put time spread appears rich.
Important note: These rules could also be used when exiting a trade.
TRADE MANAGEMENT
Time spreads can be fairly tame when it comes to risk, with the risk
limited to the purchase price when long and the risk “sort of limited” but
unquantifiable when short (more in a moment)—as long as they are closed
out before the expiration of the short-dated option. The risk of early exer-
cise of a short deep-in-the-money leg of a time spread also exists. We will
examine some of these scenarios in this section. As always, one’s game
plan should be laid out in advance of making the trade. Important ques-
tions to consider:
• What is the most efficient way to take profits? Losses?
• What should be done if the underlying reaches the investor’s target
ahead of schedule?
• What should the investor do if a breakout fails to materialize?
• What should the investor do if he is completely wrong on direction?
• What should the investor do at expiration?
These are all questions that need to be considered before the trade. Once
again, our overarching risk management protocol: If you are wrong, get out!

Trade Management 181
This means that if any of the assumptions that went into your market fore-
cast turn out to be wrong you should get out of the position.
Taking Profits and Losses
There are two points at which to exit a trade: when one’s market fore-
cast has been met or when one’s market forecast has changed. In the case
of the former, one should always have profit and loss targets going into a
trade; if they are met, one should assess the situation and decide whether
to lock in profits. We are very big fans of scaling into and out of positions.
Scaling out is a very powerful and positive way to extract any profits from
a position because it builds a level of comfort—taking money off the table
and limiting risk while staying with one’s forecast. In the case of the latter,
when the market forecast changes, it means the original assumptions used
for selecting a certain strategy are no longer valid. The trade should be
liquidated, or at the very least, modified.
In the case of liquidation, there are two ways to exit a time spread. One
is to liquidate the original position and (recalling the preceding section,
“Strategy Component Selection”) the other is to liquidate via the syntheti-
cally equivalent position. It should be remembered, however, that exiting a
time spread position with a synthetically equivalent position will result in
a jelly roll position that will need to be managed and may eventually have
assignment risk. Also, additional trades will incur additional commission
charges. For these reasons, this type of position might be more trouble than
it is worth for many traders.
• How to Exit
The decision whether to liquidate using the original position versus the
synthetic equivalent (without commission considerations) depends on two
factors: price and liquidity. Price is simple enough if one remembers to ap-
ply the pricing rules from the previous section and to use the most advan-
tageously priced time spread to liquidate the position. The other factor is
liquidity, and liquidity issues usually have to do with the moneyness of the
individual options that compose the time spread. As options move in-the-
money, they acquire a larger delta, and this makes hedging them riskier for
market makers. Accordingly, market makers will widen the bid-ask spread
of in-the-money options to compensate for this risk. Conversely, out-of-
the-money options have a lower delta, making hedging them less risky for
market makers. This usually results in out-of-the-money options having a
narrower bid-ask spread than their in-the-money counterparts. The net ef-
fect on time spreads is that a time spread consisting of in-the-money op-
tions will usually have a wider bid-ask spread than a time spread consist-
ing of out-of-the-money options, because an in-the-money call time spread
has a synthetically equivalent out-of-the-money put time spread and an
in-the-money put time spread has a synthetically equivalent out-of-the-
money call time spread. This moneyness effect can make using syntheti-
cally equivalent positions to exit a trade very effective.

Early Arrival—Underlying Price Arrives at Target Price
Ahead of Schedule
It can be maddening to the long time spreader to get the direction right
and the timing wrong, correctly forecasting a directional move but making
very little profit on a long time spread because time decay has not yet had a
chance to work on the short-dated option. This sets up a d ilemma: Should
the trader hang on and hope that the underlying price will “hang around”
the strike price for awhile and capture some time decay? Should he simply
exit? Or is there an adjustment that can be made?
First of all, he must examine the market and see if his forecast needs to be
adjusted. Was he wrong or was his timing just a bit off? It is very difficult for
traders to be totally honest with themselves in these situations because they
tend to rationalize in favor of their positions. If the trader truly believes that
the underlying is going to now move sideways at the current level, then by
all means, he should hold the position. However, if the nature of the move-
ment has changed and the underlying is now moving at a higher velocity
than initially forecast, then it is best to exit because the position is wrong.
There is another possibility: The time spread could be “rolled” to a new
target strike. The trader must feel very strongly about his forecast of move-
ment by the underlying to the new target before doing this: It is involved
and will generate a lot of commissions because he will have to execute two
vertical spreads in two separate expiration months. See Example 6.3.

Late Arrival—Underlying Price Does Not Move
When Expected
Let’s say an investor had forecast a breakout within a certain time
period and decided to trade a short time spread to target the anticipated
move. His breakout failed to materialize and he is now eating the time de-
cay generated by his short, at-the-money time spread. What should he do?
He was wrong. He should get out!
• Incorrect Direction
An investor had forecast a move lower and executed a long put time
spread at the strike near his target zone. Now the underlying price has
moved higher through resistance. What should he do? He was wrong. He
needs to get out!
• Expiration
Expiration is the trickiest time for time spread management—long or
short. The position must be closed out or rolled; otherwise, a pure direc-
tional position will be the result, and it is possible that is could involve a
position in the underlying. Let’s examine the outcome of both long and
short time spreads taken through the expiration process (Example 6.4a).
Note that a short calendar spread involves potentially unlimited (for
calls) or substantial (for puts) risk after the expiration of the near-term long
option. Additionally, a short calendar spread may be treated as an uncovered
position for margin purposes.

CONCEPT REVIEW
Volatility skew: A graphic representation of implied volatility levels
associated with different strike prices, the curves’ shape is often
referred to as a “smile” or “smirk.”
Congestion: An area where a security trades below resistance and
above support levels.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Ratio spreads strategies can be used when one forecasts a complex
market scenario, involving market direction, implied volatility levels, and
timing. They may be especially effective for contratrend trading.
The term ratio spread is used when referring to any structure that in-
volves the purchase of an option that is underwritten by the sale of a greater
number of further out-of-the-money options of the same class and expira-
tion cycle. For example, buying one March 100 call and selling two March
110 calls is a call ratio spread; buying one June 90 put and selling three June
75 puts is a put ratio spread.
The ratio of the ratio spread is determined by the number of further
out-of-the-money options sold per nearer-the-money option purchased.
Common ratios used by ratio spreaders are 1 to 2 (two sold for every one
purchased), 2 to 3 (three sold for every two purchased), and 1 to 4 (four sold
for every one purchased). However, any ratio may be used. Depending on
the ratio used, the strikes involved, the time to expiration, and implied
volatility levels, the spread could be executed for a debit, even money, or
a credit.

192 Chapter 7 Ratio Spreads
Because ratio spreads are net short of options (there are always more
short options in the position than long options), they generally will have a
short volatility bias, meaning they will be short vega and will benefit from
declining volatility. For the same reason, they generally will have a posi-
tive theta, meaning that the position will benefit from the passage of time.
For these reasons ratio spreads can be most effective when one is expecting
a low-magnitude directional move coupled with either declining implied
volatility or the passage of time:
• Call ratio spreads could be used when forecasting a low-magnitude up-
ward directional move that will be accompanied by declining volatility
or that will take a great deal of time to materialize. Usually this takes
the form of a contratrend recovery or “bounce” scenario in which the
market has been declining with rising implied volatility and the trader
is forecasting a bounce or mild correction, during which the underlying
will trade higher for a time while implied volatility declines.
• Put ratio spreads could be used when one is forecasting a low-m agnitude
downward directional move that will be accompanied by declining
volatility or that will take a great deal of time to materialize. Usually
this takes the form of a contratrend sell-off or “correction” scenario in
which the market has been rising and the trader is forecasting a sell-off
or mild correction, during which the underlying will trade lower for a
time while implied volatility declines.
Risk
Because they generally are used as contratrend trading vehicles, ratio
spreads usually are constructed so that they have minimal cost or even a
credit. Then, if the prevailing trend resumes, the position in that direction
has little or no risk. It needs to be emphasized, however, that a ratio spread
is net short of options and therefore has open-ended risk in the direction
of the short options. Therefore, one’s market forecast should assume only
a remote possibility of the market moving through the short strike of the
position with any velocity. The risk-averse trader should probably avoid
the ratio spread entirely and instead use a limited-risk spread with similar
characteristics, such as a vertical spread or a long butterfly.
STRATEGY COMPOSITION
Call Ratio Spreads
As mentioned in the previous section, the call ratio spread (Figure 7.1)
consists of a long call at a particular strike, usually, but not necessarily, at-
the-money or slightly out-of-the-money, underwritten by the sale of more
than one further out-of-the-money call of the same expiration cycle.

The bull call spread and the long call butterfly are limited-risk p ositions
that address mild upward movement and declining implied volatility and
the passage of time, as do call ratio spreads. The addition of the extra short
option at the upper strike of both of those structures reduces risk to the
downside and converts the spread to a call ratio spread—a more aggres-
sive strategy geared for taking advantage of declining implied volatility
and time decay.
Put Ratio Spreads
The put ratio spread (Figure 7.6) consists of a long put at a particu-

The bear put spread and the long put butterfly are limited-risk posi-
tions that address mild downward movement and declining implied
volatility and the passage of time, as do put ratio spreads. The addition
of the extra short option at the lower strike of both of those structures
limits risk to the upside and converts the spread to a put ratio spread—
a more aggressive and unlimited-risk spread geared for taking advantage
of declining implied volatility and time decay.
THE GREEKS OF RATIO SPREADS
Ratio spreads are complex positions. They are composed of a long option at
a particular strike that has the sensitivities of a long option and a greater number
of short options at a different strike that have the sensitivities of short options.
The combined position is sensitive to changes in underlying price, implied
volatility, and the time until expiration. We will examine the Greeks of basic
1-to-2 call and put ratio spreads. Visualizing the ratio spread as an out-of-the-
money long butterfly without the extra long option on the furthest out-of-the-
money “wing” can help one to better understand the behavior of the position.
The 1-to-2 Call Ratio Spread
• Delta
The delta of a call ratio spread is dependent on the location of the under-
lying versus the strike, time to expiration, and implied volatility. Depend-
ing on the interplay of those three factors, the delta can be long, neutral, or
short at any particular underlying price. The delta of a complex position can
be difficult to visualize without looking at graphs, but a good method for
visualizing how the delta of a complex position responds to changing mar-
ket conditions is to think of the delta of an option as the odds that the op-
tion will finish in-the-money. Continuing with the horse racing analogy, the
favorites (the in-the-money and at-the-money options) would have higher
deltas (odds) than the long shot (the out-of-the-m oney options). As the race

==================================================

The Greeks of Ratio Spreads 197
continued toward the finish line (expiration approaches), the deltas (odds)
of the in-the-money options would continue to rise toward 100 while the
deltas of the out-of-the-money options would fall toward zero.
The delta of a call ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas
of its component options. For example, the delta of the 100/105 1-to-2 call
ratio spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:2)
105 strike call delta 0.20
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3)
1-to-2 call ratio spread delta (0.50 1) (0.20 2) or 0.10
The delta of the same spread with greater time until expiration or higher
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:2)
105 strike call delta 0.30
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:3)
1-to-2 call ratio spread delta (0.50 1) (0.30 2) or 0.10
The delta of the same spread with less time until expiration or lower
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:2)
105 strike call delta 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3)
1-to-2 call ratio spread delta (0.50 1) (0.10 2) or 0.30
Figure 7.11 illustrates the relationship of the delta of a call ratio spread
to time until expiration.

Implied Volatility:July 25/30 1-to-2 Call Ratio Spread

Figure 7.11 shows that the delta of the call ratio spread becomes in-
creasingly positive with modest upward movement over time. As time
passes, the delta of the short out-of-the money options decrease faster
than that of the long at- or near-the-money option. This causes the delta
of the spread to “grow” to positive over time, as long as the underlying
does not rally too sharply. Obviously, if the underlying rises far enough, the
delta of the position will flip to negative. The same effect can be observed
with declining implied volatility in Figure 7.12. Notice the similarity in this
graph and the preceding one and recall that the effect of declining volatility
on option positions mimics the passage of time.
• Gamma
The gamma of a call ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the 100/105
1-to-2 call ratio spread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call gamma 0.10
(cid:2)
105 strike call gamma 0.04
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3)
1-to-2 call ratio spread gamma (0.10 1) (0.04 2) or 0.02
The gamma of the call ratio spread is highly sensitive to the location of
the underlying relative to the strikes. As with any spread made up of both
long and short options, the position will take on the gamma characteristics of
the underlying option position at the nearest strikes. A ratio spread includes

more short options than long options, so gamma quickly becomes nega-
tive as the underlying price rises, or as implied volatility rises. Figure 7.13
illustrates the relationship of the gamma of a call ratio spread to the underly-
ing price and the time to expiration.
The preceding figure shows how the gamma of the call ratio spread
depends on the location of the underlying and the time until expiration.
When expiration is near and the underlying price is closest to the long
option at the lower strike, the spread will have a positive gamma; when
the underlying price is closer to the short options at the upper strike, the
spread will have a large negative gamma. When there is greater time until
expiration, the gamma curve is much softer. The effect of the passage of
time on the gamma of the call ratio spread is again mimicked by falling
implied volatility, as illustrated by Figure 7.14.
Note the similarities between Figures 7.13 and 7.14 and recall that
the effects of declining volatility on the sensitivity of an option position
mimics the passage of time.
• Vega
The vega of a call ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas
of its component options. For example, the vega of the 100/105 1-to-2 call
ratio spread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call vega 0.15
(cid:2)
105 strike call vega 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:3)
1-to-2 call ratio spread vega (0.15 1) (0.10 2) or 0.05

This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the
price of the call ratio spread would change by approximately 0.05. Because
the call ratio spread is generally short vega, the value of the spread will
fall when implied volatility rises and rise when implied volatility falls.
Figure 7.15 illustrates the vega of the call ratio spread.

==================================================

The Greeks of Ratio Spreads 201
The vega of the spread is positive when the underlying price is near the
strike of the long option, and then becomes negative when the underlying
price moves toward the strike of the short options. Recall from Chapter 1
that vega increases with the time to expiration so that, all things being
equal, the vega of an option with a greater amount of time left until expira-
tion will be larger than that of an option with a lesser amount of time left
until expiration. With regard to the call ratio spread, this means that the
overall amount of positive or negative vega generated by the position will
decline as expiration approaches.
• Theta
The theta of the call ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted
thetas of its component options. For example, the theta of the 100/105 1-to-2
call ratio spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike call theta 0.06
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike call theta 0.04
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4)
1-to-2 call ratio spread theta ( 0.06 1) ( 0.04 2) or 0.02
This means that the value of the call ratio spread would increase by
approximately 0.02 per calendar day (all else being equal). Because a call
ratio spread generally has positive theta, the value of the spread will rise as
time passes and option values decay. Figure 7.16 illustrates the theta of a
call ratio spread.
Figure 7.16 illustrates how the sensitivity of the position depends on
the location of the underlying price and the time until expiration. When the

202 Chapter 7 Ratio Spreads
underlying price is near the strike of the long option, the call ratio spread
will have negative theta, and when the underlying price is nearer the strike
of the short options, the call ratio spread will have positive theta. Recall
that the theta of an at-the-money option increases as time to expiration
decreases and the theta of an out-of-the-money option decreases as time to
expiration decreases, so the swings of negative to positive theta that occur
as the underlying price shifts location between the long and short strikes
become more dramatic.
The 1-to-2 Put Ratio Spread
• Delta
As with the call ratio spread, the delta of a put ratio spread is depen-
dent on the location of the underlying relative to the strike, time to expira-
tion, and implied volatility. The delta can be short, neutral, or long at any
particular underlying price depending on those market factors. The delta
of a put ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas of its compo-
nent options. For example, the delta of the 100/105 1-to-2 put ratio spread
would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put delta 0.60
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put delta 0.20
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:3)
1-to-2 put ratio spread delta ( 0.60 1) ( 0.20 2) or 0.20
The delta of the same spread with greater time until expiration or higher
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put delta 0.50
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put delta 0.30
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4)
1-to-2 put ratio spread delta ( 0.50 1) ( 0.30 2) or 0.10
The delta of the same spread with less time until expiration or lower
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put delta 0.50
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put delta 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:3)
1-to-2 put ratio spread delta ( 0.50 1) ( 0.10 2) or 0.30
Figure 7.17 illustrates the relationship of the delta of a put ratio spread
to time until expiration.
The delta of the put ratio spread becomes increasingly negative with
modest downward movement over time. As time passes, the delta of the
short out-of-the money options decreases (in absolute terms) faster that
the long at- or near-the-money option. This causes the delta of the spread
to become increasingly negative over time, as long as the u nderlying

does not sell off too sharply. If the underlying falls far enough, the delta
of the position will flip to positive. The same effect can be observed with
declining implied volatility in Figure 7.18. Again, observe that the effect
of declining volatility on option positions mimics the passage of time.

• Gamma
The gamma of a put ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the 100/105
1-to-2 put ratio spread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)

100 strike put gamma 0.04
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3)
1-to-2 put ratio spread gamma (0.10 1) (0.04 2) or 0.02
As with the call ratio spread, the put ratio spread is highly sensitive to
the location of the underlying relative to the strikes, and the position will
take on the gamma characteristics of the underlying option position at the
strikes nearest the underlying price. Gamma quickly becomes negative as
the underlying price falls, or as implied volatility rises. Figure 7.19 illus-
trates the relationship of the gamma of a put ratio spread to the underlying
price and the time to expiration.

When the underlying price is near the long option at the upper
strike, the put ratio spread will have a positive gamma, shifting to
negative as the underlying price moves lower toward the short options
at the lower strike. Because at-the-money gamma rises and in- or out-
of-the- money gamma falls as expiration approaches, the gamma of the
put ratio spread will have a bigger swing as it moves from positive
to negative. When there is greater time until expiration, the gamma
curve is much softer. The effect of the passage of time on the gamma of

the put ratio spread is again mimicked by falling implied volatility, as
illustrated by Figure 7.20.
• Vega
The vega of a put ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas
of its component options. For example, the vega of the 100/105 1-to-2 put
ratio spread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
105 strike put vega 0.15
(cid:2)
100 strike put vega 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:3)
1-to-2 put ratio spread vega (0.15 1) (0.10 2) or 0.05
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the
price of the put ratio spread would change by approximately 0.05. Because
the put ratio spread is generally short vega, the value of the spread will
fall when implied volatility rises, and rise when implied volatility falls.
Figure 7.21 illustrates the vega of the put ratio spread.
The vega of the spread is positive when the underlying price is near the
strike of the long option, and then becomes negative when the underlying price
moves toward the strike of the short options. Recall from Chapter 1 that vega
increaseswith time to expiration so that, all things being equal, the vega of an
option with a greater amount of time left until expiration will be larger than
that of an option with a lesser amount of time left until expiration. With regard
to the call ratio spread, this means that the overall amount of positive or nega-
tive vega generated by the position will decline as expiration approaches.

• Theta
The theta of the put ratio spread is the sum of the position-adjusted
thetas of its component options. For example, the theta of the 100/105
1-to-2 put ratio spread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put theta 0.06
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put theta 0.04
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3)
1-to-2 put ratio spread theta ( 0.06 1) ( 0.04 2)
(cid:4)
or 0.02
This means that the value of the put ratio spread would increase by
approximately 0.02 per calendar day (all else being equal). Because a put
ratio spread generally has positive theta, the value of the spread will rise as
time passes and option values decay. Figure 7.22 illustrates the theta of a
put ratio spread.
The put ratio spread generally will have positive theta when the under-
lying price is nearest the strike of the short options. When the underlying
price is near the strike of the long option, the spread may have a negative
theta. Recall that the theta of an at-the-money option increases as time to
expiration decreases and the theta of an out-of-the-money option decreases
as time to expiration decreases, so as expiration approaches, the theta of
the put ratio spread will have bigger swings as it moves from positive to
negative. When there is greater time until expiration, the theta curve is
much softer.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
Because of their asymmetrical risk-reward properties—limited risk in
one direction and unlimited risk in another—and their short vega/ positive
theta characteristics, ratio spreads can be especially suited to situations
that favor limited movement in the direction of the short strike with de-
clining volatility and the passage of time. Both declining volatility and
the time decay work to expand the value of a ratio spread. In addition, the
passage of time and/or declining implied volatility cause the delta of the
ratio spread to “grow” in favor of the trader—the delta of the call ratio
spread becomes more positive; the delta of the put ratio spread becomes
more negative.
When considering a ratio spread, traders should look for situations
that favor the above scenario. Some typical market conditions conducive
to slow, limited, directional movement with the possibility of declining
implied volatility are the following:
• Contratrend moves
— The oversold bounce
— The overbought correction
• Trend decelerations
— Rally into congestion and resistance
— Decline into congestion and support

Contratrend Moves
When the market is trending, it will occasionally pause and pull back as
it corrects from temporary overbought or oversold conditions. These con-
tratrend moves tend to be muted because they usually are accompanied by
lower volumes as they trade back into support or resistance levels that
contain the magnitude of the move. As the market retraces, time will pass
and implied volatility may decline as movement in the underlying price
contracts; these factors play into the strengths of the ratio spread. If the
trend suddenly resumes, the risk is limited to the amount, if any, invested
in the spread. Figures 7.23 and 7.24 are examples of contratrend moves.

Figure 7.23 is an example of a bullish contratrend move known as an over-
sold bounce; Figure 7.24 is an example of a bearish contratrend move known
as an overbought correction.
Trend Deceleration
When the market is trending, occasionally it will enter areas of previ-
ous price congestion. Price movement usually slows when this occurs be-
cause past inventory levels are approached and momentum traders look to
take profits. Once again, slowing price movement, the passage of time, and
declining implied volatility can occur in these zones, making them attrac-
tive for ratio spread strategies. Figures 7.25 and 7.26 below are examples of
reentry into previous areas of price congestion. Figure 7.25 is an example
of a bullish rally into a previous congestion zone; Figure 7.26 is an example
of a bearish decline into a previous congestion zone.

Special Situations
Meltdowns and meltups usually are news driven—either bad news or
good news—and the underlying stock explodes to the downside or the upside
with implied volatility increasing sharply. Bottom picking in meltdowns or
top picking in meltups can be a dangerous business; these types of contrarian
plays are risky because traders are going against a very powerful trend. But

210 Chapter 7 Ratio Spreads
if they get it right, it can be a very lucrative trade. If a correction does occur, it
usually is muted because price moves contratrend. Implied volatility usually
backs off when this occurs and, again, this plays into the strengths of the ratio
spread. In addition, if the trend resumes, risk is limited to initial investment.
Volatility Skew Plays
Occasionally market forces will create large implied volatility differen-
tials between strike prices, which make “buy-low-volatility-strike, sell-high-
volatility-strike” ratio spread strategies attractive. One could purchase an
option at the lower implied volatility and sell a ratioed amount of options
at the higher volatility. If the volatility normalizes, the trade may become
profitable.
Warning: Implied volatility differentials in and of themselves usually are not
sufficient reason to initiate a ratio spread. These trades should be incorporated into
market views that are optimal for ratio spreads—limited underlying movement,
passage of time, and declining implied volatility.
STRATEGY SELECTION
Once a trader determines that conditions favorable to a ratio spread
exist, she needs to evaluate the following factors:
• Direction of the trend
• Support and resistance levels
• Congestion areas or zones
• Projected time of slow movement and/or declining volatility
Direction of Trend
Obviously, direction is important because ratio spreads do have a di-
rectional bias. Call ratio spreads are used to trade a market with a bullish
bias, and put ratio spreads are used to trade a market with a bearish bias.
The market’s trend bias must be incorporated into strike selection.
Support and Resistance Levels
Support and resistance levels need to be defined for two reasons. They
identify areas where price movement is likely to decelerate; this is impor-
tant for strike selection. Support and resistance levels are also important
because they are used to identify breakout levels for risk management, as
will be seen in the following section, “Trade Management.”
Congestion Areas or Zones
As with support and resistance levels, congestion areas or zones iden-
tify price levels at which the market is likely to decelerate and mark time

as the market works its way through previously important price levels.
When the market leaves these zones, it is likely that price movement will
accelerate, which is an important factor in risk management.
Projected Time of Slow Movement
and/or Declining Volatility
It is important for the trader to have a forecast of how long the slowed
price movement and/or declining volatility phase will last, to select the
expiration cycle of his ratio spread.
• Strike Selection
A forecast/knowledge of support and resistance levels and congestion
zones is needed for strike selection. Selecting strikes for a ratio spread is
similar to selecting strikes for a one-winged butterfly position. The differ-
ence is that, unlike the long at-the-money butterfly, the ratio spread usually
has a directional bias. As with the long butterfly, the point of maximum
profitability for the position is at the short strike of the structure, which
should be located at one’s price target. It is important that this level be
backstopped by a support or resistance level or congestion zone to slow
or stop the price movement of the underlying as it approaches the short
strike. If the underlying moves through the short strike—upward in the
case of the call ratio spread and downward in the case of the put ratio
spread—there is open-ended risk.
For example, in Figure 7.27 the underlying is moving sideways in a
range between 97.50 (support) and 102.50 (resistance). In this case, estab-
lishing a 97.50/102.50 1-to-2 call ratio spread when the underlying is near
support would seem to be an appropriate strike selection. In Figure 7.28
the underlying is declining from 105.00 toward strong 95.00 support. In
this case, establishing a 95.00/105.00 1-to-2 put ratio spread when the
underlying is near resistance would seem to be an appropriate strike
selection.

• Expiry Selection
To select the expiration month, a forecast of projected time of slow price
movement and/or declining implied volatility is necessary. If a trader esti-
mates that this behavior will persist for one month, then she would want
to use options with an expiration cycle that mirrors the forecast. When in
doubt, the trader should use the expiration cycle that expires before the
projected end of the slow period.
TRADE MANAGEMENT
Ratio spreads have a high-risk profile. Again, like the one-winged
butterfly, there is not an outside “wing option” that kicks in to limit risk if
the short strikes are penetrated. Risk is open-ended, and for that reason,
ratio spreads must be managed with an iron fist. Important questions to
consider:
• Should the trader even consider ratio spreads?
• What is the most efficient way to take profits?
• What if the short strikes are threatened?
• What if the market moves down or up through the long strike?
• How should the trader manage risk or take losses?
Should the Trader Even Consider Ratio Spreads?
Ratio spreads have open-ended risk. Not only is there risk that the mar-
ket will move through the short strikes and leave the trader long in a fall-
ing market or short in a rising market, there is also the danger of event risk.



==================================================
                     PAGE 222                     
==================================================

Trade Management 213
Event risk occurs when a large, market-moving event causes the underlying
in which the trader has a ratio spread to gap through her short strikes, leav-
ing no chance to exit the trade or manage risk and exposing the trader to
large losses. If her capital base is modest, or she can’t live with the idea of
overnight risk, then this spread is not for her. The trader needs to retreat to
the long butterfly or condor strategy to trade decelerating price movement
and/or declining implied volatility situations.
What Is the Most Efficient Way to Take Profits?
Ratio spreads will punish the greedy and undisciplined trader. As
with the long butterfly and condor, the properly positioned ratio spread
has positive time decay and the value of the position theoretically will
increase in value every day. The temptation to try to get “one more day”
of time decay out of this position can be a trader’s undoing. This type
of greedy behavior with a long butterfly or condor is not the end of the
world, because they are limited-risk positions. The ratio spread, however,
is not a limited-risk position, and getting greedy when red flags are flying
can lead to disaster. It is vitally important to have an ironclad risk man-
agement plan in place—and to stick to it. “He who fights and runs away,
will live to fight another day” is the proper mindset for ratio spreaders.
Here are some important tips:
• Take Partial Profits
Take partial profits occasionally by scaling out of the trade. For exam-
ple, if an investor’s position consists of ten call ratio spreads (say, long
10 at-the-money calls and short 20 out-of-the-money calls), he should not
be afraid to take some money off the table from time to time. He can slowly
scale out of the position as it goes in his favor. This action takes profits and
limits remaining risk.
• Watch Market Action
Remember the reason the investor got into this trade in the first place:
He had a market forecast of weak directional price action over a period of
time and/or declining implied volatility. If the underlying stock or index in
which he has his position starts to behave as though this trend may end,
he should get out.
What If the Short Strikes Are Threatened?
When the underlying price moves toward the short strike of a ratio
spread it is a two-edged sword. It is moving toward the area of maximum
profitability, but it is also moving toward the area of maximum—and
u nlimited—risk. This can be unnerving for the trader as the stakes begin
to rise. When this occurs, there are some evasive maneuvers that can be
employed. The spread can be “capped” and turned into a limited-risk
b utterfly—at additional cost of course—or the short strike can be “rolled”
away from the underlying price to give the trader more breathing room.

These rolls can be on a one-to-one basis, which again will add additional
cost, or on a ratioed basis, which may add additional costs and will add
additional ultimate risk.
Example 1
An investor has on a 100/105 1-to-2 call ratio spread, and the underly-
ing has moved up near 105.00, which is also an important resistance level.
This movement is what he had forecast, and he expects the underlying
price to continue to hover around the 105.00 area, but the risk is making
him nervous. He decides to purchase an additional call at the 110 strike and
convert his call ratio spread into a long butterfly that will still profit from
the underlying hovering around 105.00, but will limit risk to the upside if
the underlying price continues higher. Figures 7.29 and 7.30 illustrate this
procedure.

The result in Figure 7.30 is a long 100/105/110 call butterfly. The long
call butterfly will still profit from the underlying price hovering around
the 105.00 level, but upside risk is now capped—at the additional cost of
the 100 call.
Example 2
The investor has on a 95/100 1-to-2 put ratio spread, and the underly-
ing has moved down near 95.00, which is also an important support level.
This movement is what he had forecast, but it happened a little faster than

he expected. He still believes that the 95.00 support level will hold, but the
risk is making him nervous. He decides to “roll” his short 95 puts down to
the 90 strike to give himself a little extra breathing room. Figures 7.31, 7.32,
and7.33 illustrate this procedure.

The result in Figure 7.33 is a 90/100 1-to-2 put ratio spread. Purchasing
the 90/95 put spread rolls the position into a 90/100 1-to-2 put ratio spread.
This rolls the area of risk down below the 90.00 area, giving the position
extra breathing room and profit potential. Of course, this adds to the cost of
the position, which raises the upside risk if the underlying were to rally.

ing has moved up near 105.00, which is also an important resistance level.

This movement is what he had forecast, but the risk is making him ner-

The result in Figure 7.36 is a 100/110 1-to-4 call ratio spread. By ex-
ecuting two 105/110 1-to-2 call ratio spreads, the trader has rolled the
short 105 calls up to the 110 level, giving the position breathing room and
additional profit potential and moving the area of risk higher. Because
the roll was executed with a ratio spread, the additional cost is minimal.
However, the ratio has now increased from 1 to 2 to 1 to 4, so the ultimate
risk to the upside has been doubled.

Trade Management 217
What If the Market Moves Down or Up Through
the Long Strike?
If the underlying price moves againstthe forecast direction, risk is lim-
ited to the initial cost of the ratio spread, if any. The trader will need to
evaluate whether the amount of the initial investment is significant enough
to warrant using a stop-loss. If the ratio spread was executed for a credit,
there actually will be profit potential in an adverse market movement.
Because time generally works in favor of a ratio spread, there may be a
case for keeping the position even if the market moves opposite the fore-
cast direction.
For example, suppose the trader had forecast a slow, upward direc-
tional move into a strong resistance level with declining implied volatil-
ity, and had executed a 1-to-2 call ratio spread for “even money” (neither
a debit nor credit). Then, opposite of his forecast, the underlying starts
to decline. Because there is no risk in the position to the downside, he
can continue to hold for a possible rebound and fulfillment of his original
forecast at a later date. If this occurs, some time will have passed, and all
else being equal, the spread will perform even better. See Figure 7.37 for
an illustration.

Figure 7.37 Incorrect Forecast Reinitiated
How Should the Trader Manage Risk or Take Losses?
His forecast was for a slow, directional move toward a target area.
Hopefully, the target area is capped by a resistance level or a congestion
zone above the current underlying price (in the case of an upward move)
or floored by a support or congestion zone below the current underlying
price (in the case of a downward move). As mentioned in “Investment
Objectives,” these boundaries are very important not only for structuring
the ratio spread, but for risk management purposes as well. If they are
penetrated, or if the underlying price begins to move with a greater veloc-
ity and in greater magnitudes than the trader had forecast, it is time for him
to look for the exit because his forecast is incorrect.

Support and resistance levels are wonderful tools for risk manage-
ment because they provide “lines in the sand” that, if crossed, are a call to
action. The position will either need to be modified, as in the section above
about short strikes, or exited completely. The investor cannot play mind

CONCEPT REVIEW
Consolidation pattern: An area pattern that breaks out in the
direction of the previous trend (also called a continuation pattern).
VIX: The ticker symbol for the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s
Volatility Index, which shows the market’s expectation of thirty-day
volatility. The VIX is viewed as a measure of market risk. It is con-
structed using the implied volatilities of a broad range of options
from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Backspreads, also known as volatility spreads, are the exact opposite
of ratio spreads, and are used to capture high-magnitude, high-velocity
directional moves occurring in a short time frame. Backspreads can be es-
pecially effective for trading breakouts from low-volatility trading ranges
and continuation patterns as well as for high-velocity directional moves. The
termbackspread is used when referring to any structure that involves the pur-
chase ofmultiple out-of-the-money options that is underwritten by the sale
of an at-the-money or nearer-the-money option of the same class and expira-
tion cycle. For example, buying two ABC June 150 calls and selling one ABC
June 140 call is a call backspread; buying four XYZ July 90 puts and selling
one XYZ July 100 put is a put backspread.
Like ratio spreads, backspreads can be constructed in various ratios
of contracts purchased to contracts sold. The ratio is up to the trader and
depends on pricing and the amount of “gearing” desired. The greater the
ratio, the greater the gearing of the position, and the more profit potential
(and loss) it will have. Common ratios used by backspreaders are 1 to 2
(two options purchased for every one sold), 1 to 3 (three options purchased
for every one sold), and 1 to 4 (four options purchased for every one sold);

==================================================

224 Chapter 8 Backspreads
however, any ratio may be used as long as more options are purchased
than sold. Depending on the ratio used, the strikes involved, the time to
expiration, and the implied volatility levels, the spread could be executed
for a debit, even money, or a credit.
Because backspreads are net long of options (there are always more long
options in the position than short options), they carry the characteristics of
long option positions and generally will have long gamma and long vega,
and will, therefore, benefit from rising volatility and strong directional
movement. For the same reason, they generally will have a negative theta,
meaning that the value of the position will usuallydecline with the passage
of time. For these reasons backspreads can be most effective when one is
expecting a high-velocity, high-magnitude directional move with steady to
rising implied volatility, occurring in a short time frame.
• Call backspreads could be used when one is forecasting a high-m agnitude
upward directional move that will be accompanied by rising volatility.
Many factors could trigger this type of movement: bullish news about,
for example, good earnings, takeovers, and new products; technical
conditions such as bullish breakouts from consolidation or continua-
tion patterns; or simply a strong bullish trend.
• Put backspreads could be used when one is forecasting a high- magnitude
downward directional move that will be accompanied by rising vola-
tility. Many factors could trigger this type of movement: bearish news
about, for example, poor earnings, lawsuits, and scandals; technical
conditions such as bearish breakouts from consolidation or continua-
tion patterns; or simply a strong bearish trend.
STRATEGY COMPOSITION
Call Backspread
The call backspread (Figure 8.1) is a bullish position consisting of the
purchase of multiple out-of-the-money call options financed by the sale of
an at-the-money or nearer-the-money call of the same expiration cycle. This
structure gives the position leverage to the upside as it is net long calls.

The Greeks of Backspreads 227
THE GREEKS OF BACKSPREADS
Like ratio spreads, backspreads are complex positions in terms of the
Greeks. The existence of a long option position at one strike and a short op-
tion position at another strike makes the combined position verysensitive to
changes in the underlying price, implied volatility, and time until expiration.
We will examine the Greeks of basic 1-to-2 call and put backspreads.
The 1-to-2 Call Backspread
• Delta
The delta of a call backspread is dependent on the location of the
underlying versus the strike, time to expiration, and implied volatility.
Depending on those three factors, the delta can be long, neutral, or short
at any particular underlying price. The delta of a complex position such
as a backspread can be difficult to visualize without looking at graphs,
but a good method for visualizing how the delta of a complex position
responds to changing market conditions is to think of the delta of an op-
tion as the odds that the option will finish in-the-money. As options move
into the money, their deltas increase (in absolute terms), so a position that
isnet long units (meaning there are more long options than short options)
will generate an increasingly long delta on a large, upside underlying
price move or an increasingly short delta on a large, downside underlying
price move.
The delta of a call backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas
of its component options. For example, the delta of the 100/105 1-to-2 call
backspread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:2)
105 strike call delta 0.25
(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5)
1-to-2 call backspread delta (0.50 1) (0.25 2) or 0.00
The delta of the same spread with greater time until expiration or higher
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:2)
105 strike call delta 0.30
(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:4)
1-to-2 call backspread delta (0.50 1) (0.30 2) or 0.10
The delta of the same spread with less time until expiration or lower
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)
100 strike call delta 0.50
(cid:2)
105 strike call delta 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3)
1-to-2 call backspread delta (0.50 1) (0.10 2) or 0.30

                     PAGE 237                     
==================================================

228 Chapter 8 Backspreads
The preceding examples illustrate how the passage of time or declining
implied volatility can work against the backspread. A position that is meant
to take advantage of a strong bullish move above 105.00, such as the 100/105
1-to-2 call backspread, actually can generate a negative delta if the under-
lying is at or between the two strikes and enough time passes, or implied
volatility declines. Figure 8.7 illustrates the relationship of the delta of a call
backspread to the time until expiration.
Figure 8.7 Call Backspread Delta vs. Underlying Price and Time
to Expiration: XYZ August 45/50 1-to-2 Call Backspread
Source:LiquidPoint, LLC
As Figure 8.7 shows, movement in the underlying price to the upside
generally results in a rising delta as the two long calls at the higher strike
outperform the one short call at the lower strike. If the underlying price
moves to the downside, below the lower strike, the delta of the position
will collapse toward zero. However, as time passes, the delta of the long
out-of-the money call options begins to decrease faster than that of the
short at- or near-the-money option. This causes the delta of the backspread
to actually become negative in-between the strikes (see the August 3, 2008,
data series in Figure 8.7). This is the danger zone for the backspread, and
this is why timing is so important for the backspreader. If the trader is
forecasting a large directional move and is trading it with a backspread,
being off in the timing department can result in pain—even if he or she is
correct about the ultimate direction and magnitude of the move. This same
effect, but as a result of declining implied volatility, is shown in Figure 8.8.
Notice the similarity in Figures 8.7 and 8.8 and recall that, as always, the
effect of declining implied volatility on option positions mimics the effect
of the passage of time.

• Gamma
The gamma of a call backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the 100/105
1-to-2 call backspread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call gamma 0.08
(cid:2)
105 strike call gamma 0.05
(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5)
1-to-2 call backspread gamma (0.08 1) (0.05 2) or 0.02
The gamma of the call backspread is highly sensitive to the location of
the underlying relative to the strikes. As with any spread made up of both
long and short options, the position will take on the gamma characteristics
of the underlying option position at the nearest strikes. Gamma quickly
becomes more positive as the underlying price rises toward the strike of
the long options or as implied volatility rises. Figure 8.9 illustrates the re-
lationship of the gamma of a call backspread to the underlying price and
time to expiration.
Figure 8.9 shows how the gamma of the call backspread depends on the
location of the underlying and time until expiration. Backspreads are struc-
tured to be generally long gamma, as can be seen with the April 6, 2008,
and the June 4, 2008, data series in the figure. Recall the relationship of the
gamma of an option to the time until expiration. As expiration approaches,
the gamma of an at-the-money option increases while the gamma of an in-
or out-of-the-money option decreases. For the backspread, this means that
when the expiration is approaching and the underlying price is closest to
the short option at the lower strike, the spread will have a negative gamma;

when the underlying price is closer to the long options at the upper strike,
the spread will have a large positive gamma. This can be seen with the
August 2, 2008, data series in the same figure. The effect of the passage of
time on the gamma of the call backspread is again mimicked by the effect
of falling implied volatility, as illustrated by Figure 8.10.

The Greeks of Backspreads 231
• Vega
The vega of a call backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas
of its component options. For example, the vega of the 100/105 1-to-2 call
backspread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike call vega 0.15
(cid:2)
105 strike call vega 0.10
(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5)
1-to-2 call backspread vega (0.15 1) (0.10 2) or 0.05
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the price
of the call backspread would change by approximately 0.05. Because the call
backspread is generally long vega, the value of the spread will rise when
implied volatility rises and fall when implied volatility falls. Figure 8.11
illustrates the vega of the call backspread.
Figure 8.11: Call Backspread Vega vs. Underlying Price and Time
to Expiration: XYZ August 45/50 1-to-2 Call Backspread
Source:LiquidPoint, LLC
The vega of the spread is generally positive and becomes increasingly
so when the underlying price is near the strike of the long calls. The excep-
tion can be when the underlying price is at or below the lower strike short
call; then the vega of the call backspread could become negative. This is
especially true as expiration approaches, as can be seen in the August 2,
2008, series in Figure 8.11.
Recall from Chapter 1 that vega increases with the time to expira-
tion so that, all things being equal, the vega of an option with a greater
amount of time left until expiration will be larger than that of an option
with a lesser amount of time left until expiration. With regard to the call

==================================================

232 Chapter 8 Backspreads
backspread, this means that the overall amount of positive vega gener-
ated by the position will decline as expiration approaches.
• Theta
The theta of the call backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted thetas
of its component options. For example, the theta of the 100/105 1-to-2 call
backspread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike call theta 0.06
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike call theta 0.04
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3)
1-to-2 call backspread theta ( 0.06 1) ( 0.04 2) or 0.02
This means that the value of the call backspread would decrease by
approximately 0.02 per calendar day (all else being equal). Because a call
backspread generally has negative theta, the value of the spread will fall
as time passes and option values decay. Figure 8.12 illustrates the theta of
a call backspread.
Figure 8.12 Call Backspread Theta vs. Underlying Price and Time
to Expiration: XYZ August 45/50 1-to-2 Call Backspread
Source:LiquidPoint, LLC
The preceding figure illustrates how the sensitivity of the position de-
pends on the location of the underlying price and the time until expira-
tion. The call backspread generally will have a negative theta because it is
overall long options. When the underlying price is near the strike of the
long options, the theta will be more negative; when the underlying price is
nearer the strike of the short option, the theta will be less negative. Recall
that the theta of an at-the-money option increases as the time to expiration

decreases and the theta of an out-of-the-money option decreases as the
time to expiration decreases, so the swings of negative to positive theta
that occur as the underlying price shifts location between the long and
short strikes becomes more dramatic. The theta of a call backspread could
even become positive when the underlying is near the strike of the short
option and expiration is approaching, as can be seen in the August 2, 2008,
series in Figure 8.12.
The 1-to-2 Put Backspread
• Delta
As with the call backspread, the delta of a put backspread is depen-
dent on the location of the underlying versus the strike, time to expira-
tion, and implied volatility. The delta can be short, neutral, or long at
any particular underlying price depending on those market factors. The
delta of a put backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted deltas of
its component options. For example the delta of the 100/105 1-to-2 put
backspread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put delta 0.25
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put delta 0.50
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3)
1-to-2 put backspread delta ( 0.25 2) ( 0.50 1) or 0.00
The delta of the same spread with greater time until expiration or higher
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put delta 0.30
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put delta 0.50
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:3)
1-to-2 put backspread delta ( 0.30 2) ( 0.50 1) or 0.10
The delta of the same spread with less time until expiration or lower
implied volatility might look something like this:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put delta 0.15
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put delta 0.50
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:4)
1-to-2 put backspread delta ( 0.15 2) ( 0.50 1) or 0.20
Figure 8.13 illustrates the relationship of the delta of a put backspread
to the time until expiration.
As can be seen in Figure 8.13, the delta of the put backspread gener-
ally is negative, and becomes increasingly so with downward movement
of the underlying price. However, as time passes (or implied volatility
falls), the delta of the long out-of-the money options decreases (in abso-
lute terms) faster than that of the short at- or near-the-money option. This
causes the delta of the spread to become increasingly positive over time if
theunderlying price stays near the short strike or in between the strikes, as

the August 2, 2008, data series in Figure 8.13 shows. This is the worst-case
scenario for a put backspread. If the underlying falls far enough, the delta
of the position will still flip to negative, but some pain will have to have
beenendured. The same effect, but as a result of declining implied volatil-
ity, can be observed in Figure 8.14.

• Gamma
The gamma of a put backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted
gammas of its component options. For example, the gamma of the 100/105
1-to-2 put backspread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike put gamma 0.06

As with the call backspread, the put backspread is highly sensitive to the
location of the underlying relative to the strikes, and the position will take on
the gamma characteristics of the underlying option position at the strikes near-
est the underlying price. The gamma of a put backspread generally is positive
because it is net long of options, and the gamma becomes increasingly positive
as the underlying price falls toward the strike of the long options, or as implied
volatility rises. Figure 8.15 illustrates the relationship of the gamma of a put
backspread to the underlying price and time to expiration.

The preceding figure shows how the gamma of the put backspread de-
pends on the location of the underlying and time until expiration. Recall
that backspreads are structured to be generally long gamma, as can be seen
in the April 6, 2008, and the June 4, 2008, data series in the figure. However,
as expiration approaches, the gamma of an at-the-money option increases
while the gamma of in- and out-of-the-money options decreases (in ab-
solute terms). For the put backspread, this means that when expiration is

approaching and the underlying price is closest to the short option at the
upper strike, the spread will have a negative gamma; when the underlying
price is closer to the long options at the lower strike, the spread will have
a large positive gamma. This can be seen in the August 2, 2008, data series
in Figure 8.15. The effect of the passage of time on the gamma of the put
backspread is mimicked by the effect of falling implied volatility, as shown
inFigure 8.16.

• Vega
The vega of a put backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted vegas
of its component options. For example, the vega of the 100/105 1-to-2 put
backspread is calculated as follows:
(cid:2)
100 strike put vega 0.10
(cid:2)
105 strike put vega 0.15
(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:3)
1-to-2 put backspread vega (0.10 2) (0.15 1) or 0.05
This means that for every 1 percent change in implied volatility, the price
of the put backspread would change by approximately 0.05. Because the put
backspread generally is long vega, the value of the spread will rise when
implied volatility rises and fall when implied volatility falls. Figure 8.17
illustrates the vega of the put backspread.
The vega of the spread is generally positive and becomes increasingly so
when the underlying price is near the strike of the long puts. The exception

put; then the vega of the put backspread could become negative. This is
especially true as expiration approaches, as can be seen in the August 2, 2008,
series in Figure 8.17.
Recall from Chapter 1 that vega increases with the time to expiration,
so that, all things being equal, the vega of an option with a greater amount
of time left until expiration will be larger than that of an option with a lesser
amount of time left until expiration. With regard to the put backspread, this
means that the overall amount of positive vega generated by the position will
decline as expiration approaches.
• Theta
The theta of the put backspread is the sum of the position-adjusted the-
tas of its component options. For example, the theta of the 100/105 1-to-2
put backspread would be calculated as follows:
(cid:2)(cid:3)
100 strike put theta 0.04
(cid:2)(cid:3)
105 strike put theta 0.06
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:3)
1-to-2 put backspread theta ( 0.04 2) ( 0.06 1) or 0.02
This means that the value of the put backspread would decrease by
approximately 0.02 per calendar day (all else being equal). Because a put
backspread generally has negative theta, the value of the spread will fall
as time passes and option values decay. Figure 8.18 illustrates the theta of
a put backspread.

The put backspread generally will have a negative theta because it is
overall long options. When the underlying price is near the strike of the
long puts, the theta will be more negative; when the underlying price is
nearer the strike of the short put, the theta will be less negative. Recall
that the theta of an at-the-money option increases as the time to expiration
decreases, and the theta of an out-of-the-money option decreases as the
time to expiration decreases, so the swings of negative to positive theta
that occur as the underlying price shifts location between the long and
short strikes become more dramatic. The theta of a put backspread with
the underlying near the strike of the short put and expiration approach-
ing could even become positive, as can be seen in the August 2, 2008, data
series in Figure 8.18.
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
The backspread has an asymmetrical risk-reward profile that is exactly
opposite that of the ratio spread. Backspreads have substantial profit po-
tential on a large move in the direction of the long options strike (to zero
for puts), have risk that is limited to the initial cost of the spread on a large
move through the short option strike, and, in-between the strikes, have risk
that is equal to the strike differential plus or minus the initial spread cost (if
any). This makes the backspread a potentially powerful position for playing
low-probability/high-reward scenarios and breakout scenarios, or for cap-
turing strong directional trends. Because backspreads are net long options,
they generally will have a positive vega, so steady-to-rising implied volatil-
ity is desirable. Backspreads also have negative theta, so the forecast move
should take place in a short time frame.

Investment Objectives 239
When considering a backspread, traders should look for situations that
favor the above scenarios. Some typical market conditions that might lead
to high-magnitude, high-velocity movement in a short time frame with the
possibility of rising implied volatility include the following:
• Breakouts
— Consolidation patterns
— Continuation patterns
— Through resistance or support
• News
— General market-moving news, good or bad
— Company-specific news, good or bad
• Special situations
— “Back door” if-then directional plays
Breakouts
Often the overall market or a specific underlying name will go through
periods of price consolidation. These may be technical in nature (for ex-
ample, the market is just taking a “breather”) or occur during seasonal
slow p eriods (for example, after earnings periods or holidays), or there
might just be an overall lack of interest in a particular name or sector.
When this happens, the price usually will consolidate and meander, wait-
ing for some market-moving event to trigger the next phase of movement.
Often these periods are accompanied by falling implied volatility due to
lack of movement and lack of interest. Usually this phase ends and the
underlying price “breaks out” of its pattern and begins moving again. If
one is forecasting a directional breakout from a low volatility situation, a
backspread can be a good way to capture profits. Figures 8.19, 8.20, and
8.21 are examples of breakouts.

News
Economic news (for example, earnings, new products, hirings, and fir-
ings), whether affecting certain companies or sectors, or general economic
news (for example, government reports, Federal Reserve Board actions,
political developments, and events in other markets) also can trigger large
directional moves. If the trader can properly interpret the news and fore-
cast the direction in which the market or underlying is going to move, a
backspread may be used to capture profits. One caveat, however, is that
scheduled, highly anticipated releases of reports on the economy, earnings
announcements, and so on, are almost always preceded by rising implied
volatility, making structures that are net long options, such as backspreads,
more expensive. Also, after the news is released, implied volatility usually
sells off. Obviously, this is not good for a backspread, as it is generally long
vega. However, if the magnitude of the directional move is large enough
through the long strike, the gain in intrinsic value of the position will be
greater than the losses due to implied volatility declines. In this situation

Investment Objectives 241
the decision of whether or not to use a backspread depends on the trader’s
price forecast.
Special Situations
Many times the market or specific underlying issues will move
directionally and sentiment will begin to become overly optimistic or
pessimistic in the direction of the trend—overly bullish in an uptrend,
overly bearish in a downtrend—and traders can begin to sense that
market participants are getting overloaded in one direction or an-
other. Bullish consensus figures, VIX readings, put/call ratios, media
chatter, and so on can be good indicators that market participants are
getting either too optimistic or pessimistic. In cases like this some
“what-if” back door plays using backspreads could be employed. An
example of the thought process behind a “what-if” back door play is
the following:
Everybody and their brother is long this stock, and they keep pushing it
higher. The talking heads babble about it all day long, and of course the
analysts all love it. If this thing ever starts to move lower, the exit door
is going to get awfully small. . . .
This can be a great situation for some back door put backspreads, sprin-
kled like landmines in price zones that, if reached, would almost certainly
be experiencing volatile conditions. If the market keeps moving in the cur-
rent direction, no harm, but if it doesn’t. . . .
Figure 8.22 depicts a euphoric, high-volume rally, which, if termi-
nated, could result in some ugly downside price action. The trader an-
ticipates that if the support lines are broken, the price will accelerate
lower, and he places a back door put backspread just below each support
level.

242 Chapter 8 Backspreads
STRATEGY SELECTION
Once the trader determines that conditions favorable to a backspread
exist, she needs to evaluate the following factors:
• Direction of trend
• Breakout and/or price acceleration levels
• Timing
Direction of Trend
Obviously, direction is important because backspreads have a direc-
tional bias. Call backspreads are used to trade a market with a bullish bias,
and put backspreads are used to trade a market with a bearish bias. The
market’s trend bias must be incorporated into strike selection.
Breakout and/or Price Acceleration Levels
Breakout and/or price acceleration levels need to be defined. They iden-
tify areas where price movement is likely to accelerate, which is important
to know for strike selection.
Timing
As we have learned, the passage of time and/or declining implied
volatility is harmful to the backspread. One’s forecast of market tim-
ing is important for two reasons: It helps in deciding whether to use a
backspread, and if a backspread is to be used, what expiration cycle to
select.
• Strike Selection
Breakout and price acceleration zones (usually below known support
and above known resistance levels) are needed for strike selection. The
backspread needs to be structured so that the long strike is positioned to
capture price movement through the projected knowledge of breakout
or acceleration zone, while the short strike is backstopped by support or
resistance. As we have seen, what the backspreader needs to avoid is the
underlying’s price meandering near the short strike or in between the
strikes. The backspreader would like the underlying price either to acceler-
ate sharply through the long strike of the backspread or to back off. Fig-
ure 8.23 illustrates the structuring of a call backspread.
In Figure 8.23, the trader’s forecast is that penetration of resistance at
47.50 is likely to result in a high-velocity, high-magnitude price move toward
60.00. The call backspread is structured with the short call at the resistance
level and long calls in the forecast price acceleration zone. A 47.50/50.00
1-to-2 call backspread or a 47.50/52.50 1-to-4 call backspread might be good
choices in this situation.

• Expiry Selection
The forecast breakout time is needed for selection of the expiration month.
As we have seen, the passage of time is the enemy of the backspread, and being
off in one’s timing can be painful. This can be avoided somewhat by purchas-
ing backspreads of longer-dated expirations, but l onger-dated backspreads
are more expensive than shorter-dated backspreads because they carry more
extrinsic value. So if one is confident of one’s timing forecast, the expiration
date that corresponds to that forecast should be used; however, if timing might
be an issue, one should “buy extra time” by purchasing a backspread in a fur-
ther expiration that will give one a reasonable margin of error in timing.
TRADE MANAGEMENT
Backspreads, being net long options (there are more long options in the
position than short options), are limited risk positions and therefore offer the
trader a certain level of comfort. However, limited risk positions still have risk
(sometimes significant), and it is important not to get sloppy or lazy with a
backspread, because they are best suited for specific situations. As market
conditions change they need to be reevaluated to determine whether a back-
spread is still the optimal strategy or adjustments may need to be made.
• Is the backspread appropriate?
• What is the most efficient way to take profits?
• How should the trader manage risk or take losses?
Is the Backspread Appropriate?
The forecast of a high-magnitude directional move does not necessarily
indicate a backspread. Buying a backspread involves the overall purchase
of options (one is buying more than selling) and, therefore, the purchase of
volatility. If implied volatility levels are already high, this type of strategy

                     PAGE 253                     
==================================================

244 Chapter 8 Backspreads
might not be advisable. In addition, as we have seen, accuracy of timing is
an issue. Backspreads have negative time decay. If one’s timing forecast is
a bit hazy or if the timing is unknown, a strategy that is not so sensitive to
the passage of time might be more appropriate.
What Is the Most Efficient Way to Take Profits?
When one correctly forecasts a high-velocity move and has a back-
spread in place, profits might appear quickly, and they need to be managed
or they might disappear just as quickly. Here are some important tips:
• Take Partial Profits by Rolling
Recall from Chapter 4 the procedures for “rolling” a long call or a long
put position along with market movement and systematically extracting
p rofit from the position while limiting risk and maintaining market exposure.
As long as one’s forecast continues to call for high-magnitude directional
movement in the underlying, one can use this method. The following are
several examples of “rolling the trade.”
Example 1
An investor has on a 100/105 1-to-2 call backspread and the underly-
ing has exploded up to 110.00. He has substantial profit in the position but
believes the move is far from over. He would like to take some money off
the table but stay in the position for a chance to capture additional upside
movement. He decides to roll his long 105.00 calls up to the 110.00 strike.
Figure 8.24 illustrates this procedure.
Calls Strike Puts
(cid:2)1 100
(cid:3)2 (cid:2)2 105
(cid:3)2 110
Figure 8.24 Rolling Long Calls in the 100/105 1-to-2 Call Backspread
The result in the preceding figure is a 100/110 1-to-2 call backspread. The
trader sold the 105/110 call vertical spread, extracted some profit, and rolled
the long call options up to 110.00, which is now the current underlying price,
and has left himself in position for further upside price appreciation.
Example 2
The investor has a 95/100 1-to-2 put backspread and, as forecast, the
underlying has broken down through 95.00, which was an important sup-
port level. He has a good profit in the position, and now it looks as though
the stock is really going to accelerate downward. He would like to “gear

up” his position and raise his leverage by expanding the ratio but without
investing additional money. He decides to execute a 87.50/95 1-to-4 put
backspread for a credit, rolling his long puts down to 87.50 and doubling
his exposure, while still extracting money from the trade. Figures 8.25,
8.26, and 8.27 illustrate this procedure.

The result in Figure 8.27 is a 87.50/100 1-to-4 put backspread. The inves-
tor executed the 87.50/95 1-to-4 put backspread for a credit, rolling his long
puts down to the 87.50 strike and doubling the ratio, which positioned him
for a potential explosive move to the downside.
• Watch Market Action
In addition to taking partial profits, don’t stay too long at the party. If the un-
derlying price movement begins to slow or runs into old support or resistance

levels, or if implied volatility begins to drop, it may be a sign that the move or
at least the current phase of the move is coming to an end. If the movement type
begins to transition from high-magnitude, high- velocity to something else, one
should get out of the backspread and switch to a different strategy.
How Should the Trader Manage Risk or Take Losses?
As always, the trader needs a game plan for taking profits, and his fore-
cast should include price and timing targets. If the targets are met, he needs
to evaluate the new situation and decide whether to continue with the
trade by rolling, as in the previous examples, or to exit and take profits. The
forecast should also include price and timing levels that will indicate when
the trader is wrong and should exit the trade. With these types of trades, it
is important to have both price and time stop-loss levels. If either is hit, the
trader should exit the trade. For example, suppose his forecast was for an
upside breakout out of a consolidation pattern this week. If by the close of
business Friday the move has not taken place, he should exit the trade.
This type of discipline is necessary for managing backspreads because it
is easy to fall in love with the potentially unlimited profit potential of a back-
spread and get into the mindset of “tomorrow, definitely tomorrow it’s going
to happen.” Meanwhile, the time decay piles up, and as we have seen, there
is a chance that even if the anticipated directional move were ultimately to
occur it might actually work against the position. The trader must use price
and time stop-losses. If his initial forecast is off in either department, he must
exit the trade.

256 Appendix
FINAL EXAM PART II
(Each question is worth 2 points)
Scenario 1
You have purchased 100 shares of XYZ stock at $45.50. You do not antici-
pate much movement over the next 30 days and elect to short the 47.50 call
at $1.50.
1. Explain two ways that the position can make money.
2. Explain how the position can lose money.
3. What is the position known as, and can it be considered a synthetic?
4. The stock rallies to $48.50, breaking key resistance in the process, and
you do not want to be called away on your long stock. The 47.50 call
is now priced at $2.00 and the 50 call is priced at $0.75. What action
can you take to protect your position?
5. Describe the new risk-reward properties of the action taken in
Question 4.
Scenario 2
You are looking at a market index currently trading at 1365. After doing your
market analysis, you believe that the market can move lower to the 1300–1325
area by expiration. There is a confluence of technical indicators showing that
1300 is solid support. The two trades you are considering are purchasing the
1350 put at $23.00 or purchasing the 1300–1350 put spread at $15.00.
1. Based on your thesis, which trade would you prefer to initiate?
2. The stock moves down as anticipated to 1300. What are two ways
that you can “get out” of this position?
3. Describe the Greeks of boxes.
4. Assume you elected to “box” this trade. What are some risks associ-
ated with boxes?
5. Break down all the synthetic positions in a long box.
Scenario 3
You have been long ABC stock in your family trust for many years. It has
appreciated tremendously, and you figure that just as you have insurance

                     PAGE 266

Final Exam Part II 257
on your home and car, you should implement an insurance plan on your
investment in case a catastrophic event occurs.
1. What can you do to protect your investment in ABC stock without
too much capital outlay, and what is the strategy called?
2. ABC stock is currently at $125.00. The six-month 100 put is trading
at $3.00 and the six-month 135 call is trading at $6.50. Use these two
options to construct your strategy and discuss the risk, reward, and
break-even points.
3. The stock drops below $100.00. You are quite pleased that the 100 put
is now providing protection. However, you do not want to exercise
the long 100 put and thus trigger a sale. What action can you take to
avoid this?
4. Describe the Greeks with this strategy.
5. What is a similar strategy that can be implemented if a trader is short
stock instead of long stock?
Scenario 4
You are a volatility trader. You seek to trade stocks that have a tremendous
amount of movement in either direction.
1. What basic strategies would you look to implement?
2. A pharmaceutical company is subject to approval of what could be
the next “wonder” drug. The stock has moved up in anticipation of
approval, but approval would mean even more movement to the upside.
If approval is not granted, you anticipate that the stock will correct. In
any case a large move is on the horizon. The stock is at $100.00. The
100 call is trading at $20.00, and the 100 put is trading at $19.00. What
strategy can you use? Discuss the risk, reward, and breakeven.
3. Approval for the drug is granted and the stock moves from $100.00
to $120.00 on the day of the announcement. You are extremely excited
that your hard work has paid off. Unfortunately, the 100 straddle that
you purchased is trading at $40.00, only $1.00 more than you paid for
it. What has happened?
4. You liquidate your straddle. You believe the stock should move side-
ways now, but you want to give it a little room. The 100 put is trading at
$5.00 and the 140 call is at $4.50 with the stock at $120.00. What can you
trade? Discuss the risk, reward, breakeven, and exposure to vega.
5. New developments are coming to light that could begin to move the
stock. You don’t want to take off the position but are getting more

concerned that volatility will begin to increase. The stock is still at
$120.00. You want to take advantage of movement without the risk
of having an intensive vega play like the 100 straddle you previously
held. What can you do and what is that package called?
Scenario 5
Range-bound markets are your favorite. The idea of making money while
the stock sits and not having unlimited loss exposure excites you.
1. What kinds of limited-risk strategies can be used in range-bound
markets?
2. DEF stock is at $55.00. Use the following prices:
Calls Strike Puts
(cid:2)3.50 52.5 (cid:2)0.50
(cid:2)1.75 55 (cid:2)1.35
(cid:2)0.75 57.5 (cid:2)3.00
What are the risk, reward, and break-even points if you were to
purchase the 52.5/55/57.5 put butterfly?
3. Where do you want the stock to be to realize your maximum gain?
4. You don’t quite think that you are going to hit the bull’s-eye, and
the stock could actually be in the small zone of 55–58. Can you trade
another put butterfly that will increase the odds of making a profit,
and what is that new position called?
5. If you are long the 52.5/55/57.5 put butterfly and then sell the
52.5/55/57.5 call butterfly, what is your position?
Answer Key
Scenario 1
1. The position can make money if the stock remains unchanged at $45.50.
The 47.50 call would expire out-of-the-money and you would retain
the entire premium of $1.50. The stock could also rally up to $47.50, in
which case you would have a $2.00 gain on the stock in addition to the
$1.50 collected from the expiring call. This would be a total of $3.50,
which represents the maximum reward for this strategy. In addition, a
decline in volatility would reduce the option premium of the 47.50 call;
depending on the price of the stock, this could also make money.



==================================================
                     PAGE 268                     
==================================================

Final Exam Part II 259
2. This position is only partially hedged by the 47.50 call. The stock
can drop by the amount of the call premium collected before the
(cid:3)
position begins to lose money. This is at $44.00 ($45.50 $1.50),
which represents the breakeven. If the stock drops any further,
there is no more protection and you will lose dollar for dollar. In
addition, a rise in volatility would increase the premium of the
short call and depending on the stock price could also cause the
position to lose money.
3. This position is known as a covered call. This is actually a misnomer.
The only party covered is your brokerage/clearing firm. They con-
sider it a “covered” because you already have long stock in your
account in case the call is assigned. It can also be referred to as a
buy-write or covered-write. The position is synthetically known as
a short put. Short options have unlimited risk (stock price to zero in
this case). Covered calls are much riskier then they are perceived to
be because the stock is not protected all the way down to zero, only a
portion of it.
4. The best way to protect your position is to roll up the 47.50 call. You
can do this by purchasing the 47.50/50 call spread for $1.25. At this
point you are now short the 50 call at $0.25 credit. Remember that
you took in a $1.50 credit initially for the 47.50 call. You now have
made $3.00 on the appreciation of the stock and could still collect a
credit if the 50 call remains out-of-the-money at expiration.
5. The new position allows the stock to move up to $50.00 without having
to worry about being assigned. You are still holding a $0.25 credit, so
the stock could move lower by this amount before you begin to give
back profits. The breakeven of the new position is at $48.25. The maxi-
(cid:3) (cid:2)
mum reward is $1.75 (50.00 48.50 0.25), which occurs at $50.00.
Again, this is a synthetic short put, so there is risk if the stock drops all
the way to zero.
Scenario 2
1. The 1300–1350 put spread for $15.00 is the better choice here. If the
index drops to 1325, which is the top of the predicted zone, both
the put spread and the 1350 put will be worth $25.00 at expiration.
The put spread costs $15.00 versus $23.00 for the 1350 put. If the
index drops to 1300, then both trades will be worth $50.00. This will
be a profit of $35.00 for the put spread and $27.00 for the 1350 put.
Breakeven is 1335 for the put spread versus 1327 for the 1350 put.
2. The simplest way to get out of this position is by selling the 1300–
1350 put spread. This may not be the best choice, however. If the
index declines you will be dealing with in-the-money puts that have
high deltas. Market makers will widen out the bid-ask spreads to
compensate themselves for the higher delta risk. Thus, it might be
more difficult to execute the put spread is when dealing with wider

                     PAGE 269                     
==================================================

260 Appendix
bid-ask spreads. The calls, on the other hand, will be out-of-the-
money and have smaller deltas and thus tighter bid-ask spreads.
It would beeasier to execute the 1300–1350 call spread. Purchasing
this would “box” the trade and lock in profits, although increase
commission costs.
3. Boxes do not have any delta, gamma, theta, or vega risk. They are
considered “flat” positions. They may have exercise risk.
4. Since we know the value of a box at expiration with certainty, the
value of that box today is the present value of the difference between
strikes (European style expiration). Boxes do have rho risk. Changes
in interest rates will change the value of the box. Additional risks
include pin risk at expiration and possible assignment risk if the box
is American style.
5. A long box consists of a long call spread and a long put spread. It also
is a long combo at the lower strike and a short combo at the higher
strike. It can be viewed as a reversal at the lower strike and a conver-
sion at the higher strike with the stock canceling itself out. It can also
be viewed as a long gut and a short strangle. Knowing all the synthet-
ic relationships can help a trader lock in profits and reduce risk.
Scenario 3
1. A put with strike price below the current stock price can be pur-
chased and a call with a strike price above the current stock price can
be sold. This will provide downside protection, and the sale of the
call will reduce the cost of the insurance. Depending on the strikes
selected this can be implemented for a debit, for even money, or for a
credit. This strategy is called a collar.
2. Using these options, you can construct the collar for $3.50 credit. If
the stock remains unchanged you will keep the entire premium of
the collar, thus generating income in a sideways market. The maxi-
mum reward is at 135, where the stock gains $10.00 and you still
keep the entire premium of the collar for a total gain of $13.50. On
the downside there is protection if the stock drops down to $121.50,
because you have collected $3.50 from the collar. There is a zone
where you will lose until the stock drops below the put strike and
then begins to protect dollar for dollar on the downside.
3. The 100 put will have to be rolled down. This can be achieved by
selling put spreads and collecting a credit. The credit you collect
is like cashing in the insurance policy without giving up the full
insurance.
4. The Greeks can be very tricky with collars. The important thing to
know is whether you are approaching a long option or a short option



==================================================
                     PAGE 270                     
==================================================

Final Exam Part II 261
and whether it is a call or put. Knowing the basic properties of the
Greeks, you can then figure out how they change. When the stock
is anywhere between the strikes, you will have a net positive delta
because of the long stock. If the stock drops below the put strike the
(cid:3)
long put will approach 100 deltas, taking the position down to zero
deltas and fully hedging the position. On the upside, the short call
will approach negative deltas, taking the position to zero deltas, thus
eliminating any more potential gains. Gamma, theta, and vega will
increase in absolute terms as you approach a strike and then decrease
as you move away.
5. A reverse-collar can be implemented by shorting the downside
put and buying the upside call. Because of how the equity skew is
priced, this can almost always be achieved for credits and could offer
good risk-reward parameters for traders who short stock.
Scenario 4
1. A trader that seeks volatility will be looking to trade strategies that
have a great deal of exposure to vega. Two very vega-sensitive
strategies involve straddles and strangles.
2. The 100 straddle can be obtained by purchasing the 100 call and the
100 put for a $39.00 debit. This strategy’s maximum risk is the debit
paid, $39.00. The reward may be considered unlimited if the stock
continues to rally. There are two break-even points: the strike plus
the debit, 139, and the strike minus the debit, 61.
3. The volatility of the options collapsed after the announcement. This
is very typical. As people are placing their “bets” by purchasing
puts and calls, market makers are increasing the premiums. When
the announcement happens, people begin to cash in their winning
“tickets” or unload their losing trades. This reduces the volatility and
reduces option prices. This is the case here. Even though the move-
ment that was anticipated occurred, the volatility was crushed and
the position made very little money.
4. Shorting the 100/140 strangle would be appropriate. The strangle
would collect $9.50, which is your maximum reward. The break-even
(cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:5)
points are 100 9.50 90.50 and 140 9.50 149.50. This gives the
stock some room to move without incurring losses. Since you are
shortoptions, the maximum risk is unlimited and the vega is nega-
tive. You want volatility to decrease.
5. Purchasing the 120 straddle while still holding the short 100/140
strangle would place you in the iron butterfly. This will result in
profit if the stock moves up or down, away from the 120 strike, and
gives you less exposure to vega in case you are wrong about the
stock movement and volatility continues to decline.

                     PAGE 271                     
==================================================

262 Appendix
Scenario 5
1. Butterflies, condors, and their iron equivalents are limited-risk strate-
gies that can be used during sideways or consolidating markets.
2. The put fly can be purchased for $0.80. This is the maximum loss.
This is a 2.50-point butterfly, so the maximum gain is $1.70. The
break-even points are the lowest strike plus debit, or 53.30, and the
highest strike minus debit, or 56.70.
3. With all butterflies, your maximum gain is realized at the middle
strike.
4. Purchasing the 55/57.5/60 put butterfly will turn your position into
the 52.5/55/57.5/60 put condor, which realizes its maximum profit
if the stock falls in the 55/57.5 zone, thus increasing your odds of a
profit.
5. You are short the 52.5/55 box and long the 55/57.5 box.

About the Authors
Anthony J. Saliba has been a pioneer and active participant in the
d erivatives markets for more than twenty-five years. His derivatives ac-
tivities have spanned derivatives trading, training, and developing elec-
tronic trading systems and solutions. He began his career trading equity
options as an independent market maker at the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) in 1979. Over the next decade, he gained extensive
e xperience in trading currencies, equities, and S&P 500 and S&P 100 con-
tracts. In each of these markets, he emerged as a respected presence and
quickly acquired a reputation as one of the top traders. His trading accom-
plishments, most notably his success during the crash of ’87, earned him a
place in the national bestseller Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders,
by Jack Schwager.
Due to his innovative trading ideas, Saliba has become an internationally
recognized consultant on the emergence and function of electronic markets
and trading systems. He is often quoted in industry publications, including
the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, and www.theStreet.com, and is
frequently invited to speak at industry forums. He has founded numerous
industry-related companies, including Saliba Partners, LLC (1984–1999),
a proprietary options trading firm that included a Designated Primary
Market Maker (DPM) floor operation on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange; International Trading Institute, Ltd. (1989), a derivatives con-
sulting and training firm providing advanced options trading education to
large institutional market participants; First Traders Analytical Solutions,
LLC (1992), a provider of front- and middle-office trading, pricing, and
risk-management systems; LiquidPoint, LLC (1999), a broker-dealer offer-
ing options execution/facilitation and enhanced liquidity and potential
price improvement for many large Wall Street firms; and Saliba Portfolio
Management, LLC (2002), a portfolio management firm providing state-
of-the-art investment enhancement techniques through the use of deriva-
tives. In July 2007, Saliba’s firm, LiquidPoint, LLC, became part of BNY
ConvergEx Group, a leading global agency brokerage and investment tech-
nology firm. Saliba is a director of BNY ConvergEx Group and continues to
serve as president and CEO of LiquidPoint.
