ABOUT THIS STUDY GUIDE
E
xperienced traders seem to glide through the markets, swinging into and out
of trades. Their trading appears effortless, like downhill skiing on TV. The
illusion of ease vanishes when you clamp on a pair of skis and discover the bumps on
the slope. If you want to improve your trading skills, you have to work, study, and
do your homework.
I created this Study Guide to help you grow and succeed as a trader. It is based on
my years of experience as a trader and teacher of traders. The more you study the
markets and your reactions to them, the more likely you are to succeed. You need to
learn more about yourself as well as the markets—good traders always learn.
Each question in this Guide is linked to a specific chapter in The New Trading for
a Living—psychology, risk management, indicators, and so on. Write down your
answers and compare them with those in the book. When answering chart-related
questions, cover each chart with a sheet of paper and move it slowly from left to
right to imitate the unfolding of market action. Practice dealing with the uncertainty
of the markets while working with this Guide.
This Guide asks questions and provides answers—but reasonable people may dis-
agree with some of them. Trading is partly a science and partly an art—partly objec-
tive and partly subjective. Let this Guide challenge you to think deeper about the
markets and your reactions to them.
I am grateful to Henry Abelman and Jeff Parker, both repeat winners of SpikeTrade’s
Eagle Eye award, for reviewing all questions and answers. Carol Keegan Kayne did
the final check for clarity and precision.

viii ABOUT THIS STUDY GUIDE
Thanks to my former professors and students at the universities in Estonia
and the United States for providing many opportunities to teach and develop my
educational style. Thanks to the members of SpikeTrade.com, who keep sending me
trading-related questions. Posting answers to them week after week keeps me on
my toes.
I hope this Guide helps you to sharpen your skills and to become a better, more
confident trader.

Introduction
T
o win in trading, you must outperform masses of competitors. The majority
must lose in order to pay those who win. To become a successful trader, you

market crowd.
The New Trading for a Living contains several unorthodox trading ideas. The aim of
this Introduction is to pause at the beginning of the journey and to see whether you
are in tune with some of the unconventional thinking about trading.

ONE
Individual Psychology
Y
our greatest danger in trading comes from the person holding this book—you.
Our emotions often tip the scale between winning and losing. If you can stay
cool and make rational decisions, trading profits will follow.
A professional trader is calm and collected. He knows what he’ll do if the market
goes up, down, or sideways. On days when he is not sure, he stays out, patiently
monitoring the market from the sidelines. A pro feels in control.
If you feel giddy with joy when the market goes your way but freeze in fear when
it swings against you, your actions will be emotional and your account will suffer.
When the mind becomes clouded by greed or fear, even the best trading systems fly
out the window. The questions that follow are designed to help you focus on trading
psychology.

Mass Psychology
W
henever you buy or sell, you’re surrounded by a huge crowd of other buyers
and sellers, many of whom are driven by greed and fear. The sum of their
orders creates huge waves of mass optimism and pessimism. Waves become tides that
sweep the markets, causing prices to rise or fall. Crowds are extremely powerful—it
makes no sense to fight them. Crowds are strong but primitive. Recognizing this will
help you trade in the direction in which the crowd is running but hop off when a
trend is about to end.
It is hard to remain objective when analyzing markets because crowds suck us
in. Anyone who has attended a political rally or a big concert has felt the pull of the
crowd.
Some questions in this chapter test your knowledge of the basic laws of crowd
psychology. Others help you become aware of the impact of the trading crowd on
your own feelings and judgment. Now is a good time to reflect on your reactions,
rational or irrational, when you trade. Aim to relate your answers to the following
questions to your trading experiences.

THREE
Classical Chart Analysis
T
he original chartists had a revolutionary idea—to use price and volume data
rather than fundamental factors for deciding what and when to buy and sell.
Each fundamental analyst has to specialize in a fairly narrow field. Technical analy-
sis, on the contrary, is universal. Once you understand the principles of charting,
you can apply them to stocks, bonds, currencies, futures, or any other market. As the
number of trading vehicles around the globe increases, technical analysis is becoming

As long as you have the data on high, low, opening, and closing prices, along with
that on volume and open interest, you can make intelligent judgments about the
balance of power between bulls and bears in any market. Then you can trade in the
direction of the dominant market group.
In this chapter you’ll be asked to make trading decisions using charts. It’s relatively
easy to recognize patterns in the middle of a chart, but good trading signals are much
harder to identify near the right edge. That’s where you’ll have to make your trading
decisions—amid the uncertainty, noise, and tension of the markets.

Volume and Time
B
eginners watch only prices. It's easy to become hypnotized by stocks moving up
and down.
Experienced analysts gain a much deeper understanding of the markets by in-
cluding volume in their analysis. In addition, price changes need to be linked to the
length of time it took for them to occur. All trading decisions have to be made by
analyzing more than one timeframe.
This chapter also reviews open interest, a measure relevant only for the deriva-
tives markets, such as futures or options. If you don’t trade derivatives and don’t
wish to study open interest, skip questions 5–7, 5–8, and 5–9 and add three points
to your score.

General Market
Indicators
M
arkets consist of huge crowds of traders whose buying and selling create waves
of mass optimism and pessimism. The resulting price trends lure in bystand-
ers, and their buying and selling reinforces those trends, driving them to unsustain-
able extremes. Fundamental economic factors may rule the markets in the long run,
but mass psychology determines intermediate- and short-term trends.
Several indicators take the pulse of the market crowd in stocks and futures. The
indicators that analyze the stock market as a whole are especially useful for trad-
ing stock index futures and options. Since the broad market trends influence most
stocks, those signals also help stock traders.
General market indicators are especially important to those who trade in the
United States, where several advisory services track them. Overseas traders could
profit from developing similar tools in their own countries.

Trading Systems
A
trading system provides a decision-making tree for setting entries, targets, and
stops. It is a useful instrument but not a magic device that can be fine-tuned on
old data and then put on automatic for effortlessly pulling profits out of the markets.
You develop a trading system in the quiet of your office, when the noise of the
markets has quieted down. A carefully crafted system becomes your island of stabil-
ity and intelligence in the stormy environment of the market. A trusted system will
help you maintain control at a time when the tide of mass emotion sweeps people
off their feet.
This chapter will test your knowledge of several trading systems that have stood
the test of time. While answering questions, consider whether to start trading with
one of these systems or use them as a starting point for developing your own.

Trading Vehicles
S
ome professionals say—“I don’t trade stocks, futures, or options; I trade money
in my account.” They focus on system design and risk management, while what
they trade are just vehicles in which their money goes for a ride, hopefully in the
right direction.1
You have an enormous choice of trading vehicles. Before you focus on a single
class or even a smaller group within that class, it pays to know what other instru-
ments are available to you.
This chapter will test your knowledge of several major classes of trading instru-
ments. While answering questions, think about what you’re currently trading. You
may even decide to broaden your attention and trade another type of instrument,
and of course, you can always trade more than one type.
1Several years ago, a Bedouin guide in Jordan asked me about my profession, and I told him I traded
on Wall Street. He drove by the local market where his buddies traded goats, which, at about $300
apiece, were a major store of value in the desert. He asked whether I’d like to trade, but I laughed
and said that if we brought his desert traders to Wall Street and showed them how to use comput-
ers, they would out-trade many local guys.

Risk Management
E
ven a brilliant system will not guarantee winning in every trade. This is why every
system must include risk management rules. Many creators of promising trading
systems keep losing money because of poor or absent risk control.
Each and every system has its drawdown periods. That’s when risk management
means the difference between life and death. No system will do you any good if you
don’t manage risk.
Professionals spend much of their time calculating how much money to risk on
any given trade and how to vary trade size, depending on market conditions and
account equity. Risk management is essential for your survival and success.
You owe it to yourself to earn an excellent rating in this section of the Study
Guide—nothing less will do! As traders, we sail on a stormy ocean. Risk manage-
ment rules are our lifeboats and life preservers. Make sure that your safety gear is in
good order.

Practical Details
I
was in a room where a world-famous technical analyst lectured about gold. He
projected his charts on a screen and pointed out trends and potential reversals. A
trader in the audience raised his hand: “So, at the right edge, would you buy or sell?”
The great expert pondered the screen and uttered: “Well, I’m sure that in two to
three weeks, the answer to that will be very clear.” The trader stared at him incom-
prehensibly.
In trading, you don’t have the luxury of waiting for a couple of weeks for an an-
swer. You need to decide now, today, what you’ll do at the right edge of the chart:
buy, sell, or stand aside. Standing aside, by the way, is a legitimate choice. If you de-
cide to trade, you need to choose where to enter, set targets, and place stops.
Traders use a wide variety of methods to accomplish these tasks. In this chapter,
we’ll review the methods that are described in The New Trading for a Living.

Introduction
Answer 0-1: C (I and IV)
Fundamental analysts study economic conditions; technical analysts focus on market
behavior. Both can help you spot good trading opportunities.
Tips are tricky—they almost always come late; plus, the tipper who tells you to
buy will almost never tell you when to sell. Tips can be used only if you run them
through your decision-making system. Using inside information is a criminal offense
in most developed countries.
Answer 0-2: C
The three pillars of successful trading are sound psychology, a good analytic method,
and careful money management. A good trader with a sound analytic method is his
own insider.
Answer 0-3: A
The attitude of benign skepticism is the best. Borrow the ideas that seem to make
sense and then test them in the crucible of your own experience. Begin trading a
small size and gradually increase it as you gain confidence.
Answer 0-4: D
Slippage and commissions slant the “playing field” against most traders; emotional
trading finishes them off. Theft is only a minor factor in well-policed markets.

==================================================

92 ANSWERS
Answer 0-5: D
When the winner receives less than the loser lost, that transaction is called a
“minus-sum game.” Commissions and slippage make trading a prime example of
such a game. Many providers of financial services try to hide this fact.
Answer 0-6: A
You pay commissions on stock trades when you buy and again when you sell.
100 shares of a $20 stock will cost $2,000. You’ll pay a $10 commission (0.5%)
when you buy and again when you sell, for a total of $20 or 1%. If you do this trade
on margin, paying only $1,000 for your shares and borrowing the rest, that commis-
sion will be 2% of your capital—and then you’ll have to pay interest on margin debt.
That seemingly small commission multiplied by the number of trades that you
make in a year, can take a serious bite out of your account. This problem is especially
acute for small accounts, and of course, using margin makes it even worse. Lesson:
be very selective in what you trade, weigh each trade plan carefully.
Answer 0-7: B
Your slippage entering this trade was 8 cents for each of the 100 shares you bought,
for a total of $8. It was almost as big as your commission. While trading larger posi-
tions reduces the relative cost of commissions per share, there is no such break with
slippage—if you traded 1,000 shares, your slippage would have been $80 or worse.
The remedy is straightforward: use limit orders for entering trades.
Answer 0-8: C
You bought 100 shares at $20.08 and sold at $20.88 for a gross profit of 80 cents per
share or $80 for 100 shares. Your slippage was 8 cents when you bought and 12 cents
when you sold, for a total of 20 cents per share, $20 total. The $20 total slippage is
25% of your $80 profit for the trade.
When it comes to stops, limit orders won’t do. Use “market if touched” orders—
when it’s time to escape, hit the eject button. Some slippage is inevitable, but the
goal is to keep it as low as possible.
Answer 0-9: B
You’ve bought your shares at $20.08 and sold at $20.88 for 80 cents profit per share
or a total gross profit of $80. Your commissions ate up $10 entering and another $10
exiting. There was also that slippage of $8 on the entry and another $12 during the
exit. The total bite came to $40 or 50% of your gross profit—and now Uncle Sam is
licking his lips, waiting to tax you.
You need to focus on reducing the expenses of trading: ask your broker to lower
his commission rate or shop for a more competitive broker, be selective about your
trades, and whenever possible use limit rather than market orders.

ONE
Individual
Psychology
Answer 1-1: D
Trading is inherently risky because we deal with the uncertainty of the future. If
there were no risk of loss, there could be no reward. Amateurs have emotional reac-
tions—fear, elation, anger. A professional trader measures each risk in advance and
trades only when the odds are clearly in his favor.
Answer 1-2: A
You must strive to achieve your personal best, to become the best trader you can.
Focusing on money, buying toys, or trying to impress others will only divert your
attention from the top goal—reaching your personal best. A good surgeon doesn’t
count money at the operating table—and neither does an intelligent trader while he
is in a trade.
Answer 1-3: C
Treat your mistakes as learning opportunities: find the causes of your losses, and cor-
rect those mistakes going forward. This is an emotionally hard task, but it needs to be
done in order to win. Without such analysis, trying to trade your way out of a hole,
even with a new guru, is doomed to failure. You need to figure out exactly what got
you into a hole in the first place. We’ll return to this topic in the chapter on keeping
a trading diary.

96 ANSWERS
Answer 1-4: A
A large account allows you to diversify, trade multiple positions, and spend pro-
portionately less on services. Beginners often discard these advantages by blowing
money simply because it exists in their accounts. We’ll return to the rules on manag-
ing trade size in the chapter on money management.
Answer 1-5: D (III and IV)
Commercial trading systems are built and optimized using old data; they self-destruct
when markets change. An intelligent trader who develops his own system can make
needed adjustments; a trader who purchases a system sinks with it. Even systems
with built-in optimization eventually self-destruct because we do not know what
kinds of optimization will work in the future. Following trading signals from any
system requires discipline and evokes essentially the same emotions as independent
trading. There is no substitute for mature judgment.
Answer 1-6: C (I, II, and III)
One of the key signs of a gambling attitude is the inability to stop trading, stay on
the sidelines, and reflect on one’s behavior. Traders who gamble tend to reverse their
positions and feel depressed or elated depending on the outcome of their latest trade.
A losing streak is a common experience; when you hit one, stop trading until you’ve
spent time reevaluating your method. Serious traders learn from their losses, while
gamblers continue with their compulsive trading.
Answer 1-7: C
We trade the way we live. Personal discipline is essential for success. Look for com-
mon problems in your trading and everyday life. This trader seems to have serious
issues with responsibility. He needs to face it and get himself organized in everyday
life as well as in trading.
Answer 1-8: D (I and IV)
To win, you don’t have to be more intelligent or knowledgeable than other traders,
but you must be better disciplined. Your feelings influence your trades, including
entries, exits, and risk management. If your mind is clouded by fear or greed, no
system will help. Getting high from trading leads to gambling, accepting bad odds,
and losing.
Answer 1-9: C (I and III)
You may increase your trading size as long as you don’t risk a greater percentage of
your equity—we’ll return to this in the chapter on risk management. A vacation
from trading may not be a bad idea—spend some of the time analyzing what you did
right. On the other hand, becoming sloppy with stops and lazy in research are typical
behaviors of a loser on a lucky streak.

INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY 97
Answer 1-10: D
Losers are addicted to the thrill of the game and hope for a big win. They keep poor
records, just like alcoholics don’t count their drinks. They switch between trading
systems and methods, just like alcoholics switch from drinking in bars to drinking
at home.
Answer 1-11: C
Losers are hooked on the excitement of trading and keep hoping for a big win. They
blame others for their losses and avoid accepting personal responsibility.
Answer 1-12: D
Accepting responsibility for your losses blows away the smoke of illusions and puts
your trading on a new, realistic footing. A better trading system, new trading meth-
ods, and a major bull market can help, but personal responsibility comes first.
Answer 1-13: B (II and III)
A trader who has the courage to face his own role in losing can turn around; going
forward, he is likely to cut losses short and avoid overtrading. His discipline will free
him from fear, but it will not lower his rates of commissions and slippage—for that
he needs to carefully shop for a broker and avoid market orders.
Answer 1-14: C
Being calm and disciplined is the cornerstone of successful trading. Writing down
your trade plans and implementing them will put you on the road to success—we’ll
return to this topic in the chapter on trade plans. Bigger capital, knowledgeable
friends, and a history of success in other endeavors are all desirable—but none equals
the importance of disciplined planning. Emotional trading is the enemy of success.
If trading makes you feel giddy or fearful, those feelings will cloud your judgment.
Exit your trades when you feel the grip of emotions.
Answer 1-15: A
A trader’s own impulsivity makes the market appear confusing and illogical. Other
problems, such as a shortage of good information, small capital, or even the market’s
periods of randomness, contribute less to confusion than emotional trading.
Answer 1-16: C
A trade begins when you decide to enter the market, and it ends when you
decide to exit. Those decisions are like the bookends of every trade, and they are
yours alone. You may use technical indicators, fundamental analysis, or even pay
attention to trusted advisors—but only you can decide when a trade begins and
when it ends.

TWO
Mass Psychology
Answer 2-1: D
Prices are set by crowd members who place orders to buy or sell, or else stand
aside. Each price tick reflects the latest consensus of value, hammered out by those
orders or the withholding of orders. Ticks coalesce into patterns—the footprints of
bulls and bears on our charts. “Supply and demand curves” are far removed from this
sweaty reality of the market. Prices are connected to fundamental values in the long
run but are governed by crowd psychology from day to day.
Answer 2-2: C
Bulls try to buy as low as possible, and bears try to sell as high as possible. Both know
that they have to hurry before some uncommitted trader steps in and snatches away
their bargain. Professionals aim to identify the dominant group and trade with it. The
goal of a good technical analyst is to discover the balance of power between bulls and
bears—in order to trade in the same direction as the winning group. The danger of
forecasting is that it locks us into a specific mind-set instead of focusing on the cur-
rent reality of the market.
Answer 2-3: C
Reading newspapers, watching TV, and surfing the net often lead to poorly planned
and impulsive trades. Why trade, whether a large or a small size, when you aren’t
sure what to do at the moment? “When in doubt, stay out” is a sensible rule.

100 ANSWERS
Answer 2-4: B
The profits you’re trying to make can come from only one source—from other
traders’ accounts. The mirror image of that is that any losses you take will give your
money to other traders. Trade defensively because other traders will try to pick
your pockets before you can pick theirs. Brokers and exchanges will also take their
cut, whether you win, lose, or draw.
Answer 2-5: B (I and III)
When we join crowds, our independence dissolves, and the capacity for critical
thinking goes out the window. Crowds are impulsive, adding to volatility. Crowd
members blindly follow trends, and their psychological dependence makes them
unlikely to leave the crowd, until shaken by a severe loss.
Answer 2-6: D (I, II, III, and IV)
The greater the uncertainty, the more likely we are to turn to others for reassurance
and comfort. This behavior is deeply ingrained in human nature. Groups are held
together by their loyalty to the leader.
Answer 2-7: A (I)
Crowds are bigger and stronger than any of us; don’t argue with the market. Crowds
are strong but primitive, and you can exploit their repetitive behavior—but only if
you can stand apart from them. Market crowds are right during trends but wrong at
turning points. When you let the market make you feel elated or depressed, you give
it power over yourself; professional traders train themselves not to react emotionally
to gains or losses.
Answer 2-8: C
All eyes in the market are glued to prices. The longer a rally lasts, the more people
turn bullish, pushing prices higher and attracting even more bulls. A persistent de-
cline makes more people feel bearish, and their selling helps push the marker even
lower. Price is the trend’s leader. Few financial firms are big enough to dominate a
market for days or even hours. Gurus are to the market like a tail is to a dog, and
few dogs chase their tails for very long. Fundamental changes in the economy set
conditions for bull and bear markets, but only traders can buy and sell, creating self-
reinforcing price trends.
Answer 2-9: B (II and III)
Prices are hammered out in the battles between bulls and bears. Prices rally when
confident bulls are paying up, while sellers demand a premium for participating in
the game that’s going against them. There is a buyer and a seller behind every transac-
tion. The number of stocks or futures bought and sold is equal by definition.

MASS PSYCHOLOGY 101
Answer 2-10: D (I, II, III, and IV)
In a downtrend, the shorts are making money, and many become willing to sell at a
lower price to increase their positions. At the same time, bulls are losing, and many
want to get out. Those that agree to buy do it only at a discount. They place their
bids below the market, forcing bears to sell cheaper. This process is reversed during
uptrends.
Answer 2-11: B (II and III)
A price shock is a sudden move against the trend. It frightens the dominant group
and makes the opposition bolder. A sudden price break in an uptrend provides a
price shock that frightens the bulls. Even if they manage to take prices to a new high,
their confidence is shaken, and the uptrend may well be ready to reverse.
Answer 2-12: C
A bearish divergence occurs when prices rally to a new high, while an indicator rises
to a lower peak. In a bullish divergence, prices fall to a new low, while an indicator
falls to a more shallow low. Bearish divergences help identify uptrend tops. Bullish
divergences help identify downtrend bottoms. They are among the most useful pat-
terns in technical analysis.
Answer 2-13: B (I and IV)
A trader must stay calm, focus on the reality of the market, identify the current
trend, and get in gear with it. When traders try to forecast exactly what the market
will do, their egos become wedded to their predictions, and it becomes hard for
them to change their trading stance. When the market refuses to follow forecasts,
traders who stick to them get financially hurt.

THREE
Classical Chart Analysis
Answer 3-1: I = C; II = D; III = B; IV = A
Amateurs tend to get their information after work and trade in the morning. Pro-
fessionals respond to changing conditions throughout the day and tend to dominate
the market near closing time. Buying pushes prices up, and the highest price of
the day marks the maximum power of bulls. Selling pushes prices down, and the low-
est price of the day marks the maximum power of bears. This reasoning also applies
to weekly and intra-day charts.
Answer 3-2: C (I, II, and III)
Wishful thinking is rampant among analysts, especially those who don’t trade. Keep-
ing basic definitions fuzzy contributes to the confusion. It is quite common for the
markets to be trending higher and lower at the same time in different timeframes.
Good analysts who focus on different timeframes may come to different conclusions,
and all can make profitable trades.
Answer 3-3: C
Slippage tends to be lower on quiet, narrow-range days. That’s when you can get a
better entry, but it doesn’t change your commissions.

104 ANSWERS
Answer 3-4: 4 (A, B, C, and D)
MDT is tracing a pattern of rallies and declines. As soon as prices begin to decline
from the latest peak, draw a horizontal line across that peak, marking a resistance
level. As prices rally again, they sometimes slow down at the resistance level. After
they penetrate it, they usually pull back—what used to be resistance becomes a sup-
port level.
Answer 3-5: D (I and IV)
Support lines are drawn across the lows, and resistance lines across the highs. They
can change roles with the passage of time, as the market moves away from those
levels. The edges of congestion zones show where masses of traders have traded and
reversed their positions. Extreme prices show only the levels of panic among the
weakest market participants.
Answer 3-6: D (I, II, III, and IV)
Support and resistance exist because traders have memories. The more intense
their memories, the more actively they buy and sell, strengthening support and re-
sistance. High volume reflects a greater degree of financial and emotional commit-
ment, while the greater height of the support and resistance zones shows a higher
level of activity, and consequently, stronger memories. The greater the duration of
a congestion area and the more times it’s been hit, the more traders expect a new
reversal to occur, reinforcing support and resistance.
Answer 3-7: C (I, II, and III)
Waiting for a new low before shorting helps ensure you’re dealing with a downside
breakout. False breakouts are the bane of amateurs, but professional traders love
them. They often wait until a downside breakout stops making new lows and then
trade against it: buy and place a protective stop near the latest low. Since prices made
a new low yesterday, shorting at the opening would mean following the trend, but
buying would be a poor option.
Answer 3-8: A = IV; B = I; C = III; D = II
The lower dashed line, drawn across the edge of a congestion area, marks the level of
support. When prices break out to a new low during bar A, and even slightly lower
during bar B, there is a possibility that the downtrend will resume. Still, the short-
ness of those bars indicates that the downmove is facing a stiff resistance. As bar C
moves up into the congestion area, it leaves behind a false downside breakout. You
may start buying when it crosses above the previously broken support line, with
a stop near the recent lows. The shortness of the last bar indicates that the rally is
slowing down—tighten your stop and consider moving it up to the breakeven level.

CLASSICAL CHART ANALYSIS 105
Answer 3-9. Trends = A and C; Trading ranges = B and D
When prices trend, they keep rising or falling over time, reaching higher highs or
lower lows. In trading ranges, most rallies peter out at approximately the same highs,
and declines stop at approximately the same lows. As a trader, when you recognize
a trend, follow it and hang onto positions. If you trade the swings within a trading
range, be extra careful not to overstay your positions.
Answer 3-10. I = G; II = A, B, and F; III = C and D; IV = E
The actions of any trading vehicle as it nears support or resistance provide informa-
tion about its strength or weakness. When a stock cannot rise up to touch resistance,
it shows weakness. Holding above support indicates strength. False breakouts pro-
vide some of the best signals in technical analysis.
Answer 3-11: C (I, II, and III)
The trend is your friend. As long as you see the pattern of higher highs and higher
lows, trade that market from the long side. Make sure to protect your positions with
stops and move them up as the trend progresses. Add to your positions only after
your paper profits have been protected. If the market takes out its previous low, it
throws the uptrend in doubt.
Answer 3-12: A does not apply
Tails show that either a high or a low price level has been rejected by the mass of mar-
ket participants. Since markets tend to move away from rejected price levels, it pays
to trade in the direction opposite a tail. Some trading vehicles are more likely to have
tails than others—you see three of them on this chart of BA, followed by reversals.
Answer 3-13: D is not permitted
Paying close attention to market action after a kangaroo tail, you may increase your
position size or take profits when the move appears to stall. What you shouldn’t do
is place your stop below the tip of the tail because it would expose a trade to too
much risk.

Computerized
Technical Analysis
Answer 4-1: A = (I)
Computerized technical analysis is more objective than classical charting. You may
argue whether support or resistance is present, but there can be no argument about
the direction of an indicator—it’s either up, down, or flat. A good technician aims
to discover the balance of power between bulls and bears and bet on the winning
group—not to forecast the future. A computer doesn’t remove emotions from trad-
ing because we still have to place our orders. Anyone who tries to sell you “a sure
thing” should be viewed with utter suspicion.
Answer 4-2: I = B; II = C; III = A
A toolbox is a collection of analytic and charting tools. Black boxes for automat-
ic trading come with excellent historical records but self-destruct when markets
change; gray boxes straddle the boundary between those two groups.
Answer 4-3: I = B; II = C: III = A
It pays to combine indicators from different groups so that their negative features
cancel each other out while their positive features remain undisturbed. We’ll return
to this theme in the chapter on the Triple Screen trading system.
Answer 4-4: B
To calculate a simple moving average, add the closing prices in its time window and
divide their sum by the number of days in that window. Adding prices for the past 5
days produces 110, and dividing 110 by 5 is 22.

108 ANSWERS
Answer 4-5: A
Exponential moving averages are harder to calculate by hand than simple MAs. If you
use a computer, both are equally easy.
Answer 4-6: D
A rising EMA confirms that bulls are in control—it’s time to go long. When EMA
declines, it shows that bears are in control—it’s time to go short. The ability of an
EMA to reach a new high shows that bulls are stronger than before, while declining
to a new low shows that bears are stronger than before. These are important signals,
but less frequent or important than the direction of the EMA slope. The width of the
EMA’s time window is set by the trader.
Answer 4-7: 1 = A & C; 2 = B
When the EMA rises, trade the stock only from the long side—place your buy or-
ders slightly below the EMA. When the EMA turns down, trade the stock from the
short side by placing sell orders slightly above the falling EMA. You’re free to stand
aside whenever you’d like.
Answer 4-8: 1 = D, E, F, and G; 2 = A, B, and I; 3 = C, H, and J
When the EMA points up, pullbacks mark buying opportunities. When the EMA
points down, prices are usually below it, and rallies to the EMA mark shorting op-
portunities. The transitional zones between uptrends and downtrends are the hardest
to trade. When in doubt, stand aside until a clear trend emerges.
Answer 4-9: D (I, II, III, and IV)
Each price is a momentary consensus of value, while a moving average reflects the
average consensus of value. A shorter-term MA tracks short-term consensus, and
a longer-term MA tracks longer-term consensus. MACD lines consist of moving
averages, and when the fast line of MACD is above or below the slow line, it shows
whether bulls or bears currently dominate the market.
Answer 4-10: C isn’t true
MACD-Histogram tracks the spread between the fast and slow MACD Lines. Its
slope is defined by the relationship between the last two bars of MACD-Histogram.
When the slope rises, it shows that bulls are in control, and when it declines, it shows
that bears are in control. It pays to trade in the direction of the dominant market
group. This is not forecasting—it’s reading the market and betting that the inertia of
the market crowd will continue.

==================================================

COMPUTERIZED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 109
Answer 4-11: 1 = D; 2 = A; 3 = B and E; 4 = F; 5 = C
When MACD-Histogram reaches a new high, it tells you that bulls are strong and
prices are likely to retest or exceed their latest peak. When it falls to a new low, it
shows that bears are strong and prices are likely to retest or exceed the latest low.
Afterwards, when MACD-Histogram crosses its zero line, it signals that the power
of the dominant group has been broken.
A bullish divergence gives a strong buy signal; it occurs when prices fall to a new
low, but MACD-Histogram traces a shallower bottom. A bearish divergence gives a
strong sell signal; it occurs when prices rise to a new high, but MACD-Histogram
traces a lower high.
Answer 4-12: C
The bearish divergence has sent prices lower, but they refused to break below their
EMA. At the same time, MACD-Histogram has dropped below zero, showing that
bears are nearing their maximum effort level. With bears having delivered about as
much power as they could and prices holding up, it’s better to take profits and move
to the sidelines.
Answer 4-13: C
The part of today’s bar that protrudes above or below yesterday’s bar represents
today’s directional movement. If today’s bar extends both above and below yester-
day’s bar, then only the longer part represents directional movement. If today’s bar
is inside of yesterday’s bar, or if it extends above and below by equal amounts, direc-
tional movement is zero.
Answer 4-14: I = B; II = A, C, E; III = D
Trade in the direction of the upper Directional Line as long as ADX rises above
the lower Directional Line. Exit when ADX rises above both Directional Lines and
then ticks down. Another exit signal occurs when ADX sinks below both Directional
Lines. As long as ADX stays below both +DI and –DI, avoid using a trend-following
method.
Answer 4-15: C
When ADX rises above both Directional Lines and then ticks down, it signals the end
of a strongly directional move and suggests the onset of greater volatility. You can still
trade this market, but only using shorter-term indicators rather than the Directional
system.
Answer 4-16: B
Oscillators show whether bulls or bears are currently in control. Their peaks and
bottoms mark the extremes of mass optimism and pessimism. Overbought readings
of oscillators help identify market tops, and oversold readings help catch market bot-
toms. These signals tend to work well during trading ranges but are less useful during
trends. No indicator can catch all tops and bottoms.

Answer 4-17: D
When an oscillator reaches a new record high, it reflects strength and tells traders
that the rally is likely to continue, even if there is a temporary pause. You may add to
long positions or take partial profits, but it’s better to ignore shorting signals because
under those conditions, prices aren’t likely to drop by a meaningful amount.
Answer 4-18: 1 = A, C, I; 2 = B, E, F; 3 = E–F; 4 = C–D and I–J; 5 = D, G, H,
and J
Stochastic becomes overbought when it rises to or above its upper reference line.
There it gives a signal to sell or at least avoid buying. Stochastic becomes oversold
when it falls to or below its lower reference line. There it gives a signal to buy or at
least avoid shorting.
A failure swing occurs when Stochastic fails to reach its reference line during a
market move. When Stochastic could not reach its upper reference line during the
rally G, it showed that bulls were weak and gave a sell signal. Failure swings D and J
became parts of bearish divergences. In the bullish divergence E–F, the second bot-
tom was shallower than the first, but not a failure swing because it was below the
lower reference line.
Answer 4-19: C
Stochastic is near its neutral midpoint—but it’s falling from a powerful bearish pat-
tern. It has just traced a failure swing and a bearish divergence. In addition, you can
see an upward-pointing kangaroo tail on the price chart, reinforcing Stochastic’s
bearish message.
Answer 4-20: 1 = A, B, F; 2 = D; 3 = D–E; 4 = B–C
RSI becomes overbought when it rises above its upper reference line. There it gives
sell signals, which help traders sell short in downtrends or in flat markets, but are of-
ten premature during uptrends. RSI becomes oversold when it falls below its lower
reference line. There it gives buy signals, which help traders go long in uptrends or
flat markets but are often premature during downtrends. Bullish and bearish diver-
gences give the strongest buy and sell signals. All divergences you see on this chart
preceded substantial market moves.
Answer 4-21: B
RSI has just traced a clear bearish divergence, with its first top above and the second
below the upper reference line. This bearish message is reinforced by the fact that
the slight price decline of the past few days took TIF below the top it reached several
months earlier. A false upside breakout is now in place and that, reinforced by the
RSI divergence, gives a signal to sell short.

COMPUTERIZED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 111
Answer 4-22: A (I and II)
When the market trend is down and an oscillator rises above its upper reference line,
it identifies a short-term splash of bullishness—a shorting opportunity. Afterward,
you may want to cover shorts when an oscillator falls below its lower reference line,
or you may want to hold shorts. In any case, do not use oscillators to go long in a
well-established downtrend. As Peter Lynch, a noted money manager, once wrote:
“Trying to catch a bottom is like trying to catch a falling knife—you invariably grab
it in the wrong spot.”

FIVE
Volume and Time
Answer 5-1: A
Each trade reflects a financial and emotional commitment by two traders: a buyer
and a seller. Since one of them is bound to be right and the other wrong, volume
represents the activity of winners and losers. It surges when losers panic. It mirrors
current activity but doesn’t forecast the future.
Answer 5-2: 1 = B; 2 = A; 3 = C; 4 = D
Trends tend to persist when the volume is steady or rises in an orderly manner. They
usually expire with either a bang or a whimper—a burst of volume or its drastic
shrinkage. The trend cannot continue after masses of losers start leaving.
Answer 5-3: 1 = D; 2 = A and B; 3 = C and F; 4 = E and G
Rising or steady volume confirms trends. When prices rise to a new high or fall to a
new low while volume shrinks, it tells us that the price trend is likely to reverse or
at least to pause.
Answer 5-4: B
There is a powerful rally going on, with a steady pattern of higher highs and lows.
CPST is slowly declining from its latest high, while volume is shrinking. Wait for a
bar or a few bars that fail to reach a new low for this minor downmove—and then
go long.

Answer 5-5: C (I, II, and III)
OBV is created by adding each day’s volume to a running total when a trading vehicle
rises and subtracting it on the days when that vehicle falls. OBV confirms bull moves
when it rises to a higher high than at the previous peak; it confirms declines when it
falls to a lower low than at the previous bottom. Prices represent the consensus of
value, while volume, measured by OBV, tracks traders’ emotions.
Answer 5-6: 1 = D; 2 = C; 3 = B; 4 = A
Opening and closing prices are among the most important prices of the day. Open-
ings tend to be dominated by amateurs whose orders flood the markets in the
mornings. Closings tend to be dominated by professionals who monitor the condi-
tions all day. Accumulation/Distribution ties daily volume to the relationship be-
tween opening and closing prices.
Answer 5-7: B
The number of long and short positions in the derivatives markets is always equal.
While stocks represent current ownership, derivatives are contracts for future de-
livery. Each contract has two sides: a seller and a buyer. This is why open interest
reflects the number of contracts held by longs or owed by shorts in any given market
on any given day. It equals the total long or the total short position.
Answer 5-8: 1 = B; 2 = C; 3 = C; 4 = A
Open interest rises only when a new buyer and a new seller enter the market be-
cause their trade creates a new contract. Open interest falls when a bull who is long
sells his contract to a bear who buys it to cover his short trade, and both close out
their positions. If a new bull buys from an old bull who’s getting out, open interest
remains unchanged. Nor does it change when a new bear sells to an old bear who
buys to get out of his short position.
Answer 5-9: D (1, 2, 3, and 4)
When open interest rises, it shows that a crowd of confident bulls is facing down a
crowd of equally confident bears. One group is sure to lose, but as long as potential
losers keep pouring in, the trend is likely to continue.
Answer 5-10: C (1, 2, and 3)
The direction of the move shows whether the dominant force was up or down. The
distance between today’s and yesterday’s closing prices reflects the margin of victory
by bulls or bears. High-volume rallies and declines are more forceful and more likely
to persist. While related markets are important, they don’t reflect the force of moves
elsewhere.

VOLUME AND TIME 115
Answer 5-11: D
Force Index links three essential factors: the direction of price change, its extent, and
the volume on which it occurred. To calculate the daily Force Index, subtract yester-
day’s closing price from today’s and multiply the result, whether positive or negative,
by today’s volume.
Answer 5-12: D (I, II, III, and IV)
Smoothing the raw Force Index with a moving average helps recognize its trend—a
short-term trend using a short EMA or an intermediate trend using a longer EMA.
When the 2-day EMA of Force Index dips below zero during market rallies, it iden-
tifies buying opportunities, and when it rallies above zero during market drops, it
marks shorting opportunities. The 13-day EMA of Force Index helps identify bullish
and bearish zones by its position above or below its zero line. Divergences between
Force Index and price tend to mark approaching trend reversals.
Answer 5-13: 1 = G and H; 2 = F; 3 = A, B, C, and D; 4 = E
In the left half of the chart, prices are in a downtrend, confirmed by a falling EMA.
Whenever the 2-day EMA of Force Index rises above zero, it shows a brief recovery
by the bulls—a shorting opportunity. In area E, prices fall to a new low but recoil
from it, leaving behind a false downside breakout, while Force Index traces a bullish
divergence, with a much more shallow low. This is a good time to cover shorts. In
area F, the EMA of prices turns up—it signals to stop shorting and look for buying
opportunities. Afterwards, Force Index declines below zero in areas G and H, giving
buy signals.
Answer 5-14: B
At the right edge of the screen, a moving average of price is trending higher, indi-
cating an uptrend. The 2-day Force Index has dipped below zero, signaling that the
stock is short-term oversold and giving a buy signal. You have two main ways to act
on this signal. You may place a buy order at the high of the current bar, aiming to
catch an upside breakout. Alternatively, you may measure the extent of an average
downside penetration of the EMA and place your buy order at a similar distance
below the current EMA.
Answer 5-15: 1 = C; 2 = A and D; 3 = B
The longer-term Force Index, smoothed with a 13-bar EMA, helps identify trend re-
versals: bullish when it crosses above the zero line and bearish when it crosses below
that line. It is also possible to draw horizontal bullish and bearish lines slightly above
and below the zero line. Waiting for their crossovers, rather than those of the zero
line, will reduce whipsaws—but it will also slow down the good signals. What you’d
gain in one trade, you’ll lose in another. A lower peak of Force Index in area B shows
that the bullish force is weakening and prepares you for a coming trend reversal.

Answer 5-16: B
The Force Index is positive—bullish, while the trend is up, confirmed by a rising
EMA. This combination suggests going long, using pullbacks to the EMA for buying.
Answer 5-17: C (1, 2, and 3)
Price cycles owe their existence to fundamental production factors, such as weather
and seasonal shifts in supply and demand, as well as waves of greed and fear among
traders.
Answer 5-18: 1 = D; 2 = A and E; 3 = B and F; 4 = C and G
The season of an indicator is defined by its slope and its position above or below the
centerline. When an indicator turns up but is below its centerline, it is spring; when it
rises above its centerline, it is summer; when it declines but is above its centerline, it
is autumn; and when it falls below its centerline, it is winter. Spring is the best season
for going long, and autumn is the best season for selling short. Seasons are not rigid—
not in nature and not in the markets. Notice a brief warm spell in winter in the area
between letters B and C.
Answer 5-19: A
Each timeframe relates to its next greater and lesser timeframes by a factor of 5.
When you analyze a market in two timeframes, the shorter of them has to be about
five times shorter than the longer one. If your favorite timeframe is daily, you must
first examine weekly charts.

SIX
General Market
Indicators
Answer 6-1: C (1, 2, 3, and 4)
New Highs are the stocks that have risen to the highest level in a year, while New
Lows are the stocks that have fallen to the lowest level in a year on any given day.
New Highs are the leaders in strength and New Lows are the leaders in weakness.
The New High–New Low Index (NH-NL) works by measuring the difference be-
tween the strongest and the weakest stocks on any given day. It is a leading indicator
of the stock market.
Answer 6-2: 1 = D; 2 = C; 3 = A; 4 = B
When the market rallies and NH-NL rises to a new high, it shows a growing bullish
leadership. It pays to follow the leaders and go long. When the market declines and
NH-NL drops to a new low, it shows that bearish leadership is becoming stronger.
This bearish divergence indicates that it pays to go short. If the broad market rallies
but NH-NL traces a lower peak, it shows that the uptrend is losing its leaders and
may be in trouble. If the market falls to a new low but NH-NL traces a higher bot-
tom, it shows that the downtrend is losing its leaders and nearing a bottom.

==================================================

120 ANSWERS
Answer 6-3: 1 = A and D; 2 = B and F; 3 = G–H; 4 = D–E
NH-NL tracks the numbers of the market leaders, making it a leading indicator of
the stock market. Its bullish zone is above the zero line or, if you want to make it less
prone to whipsaws, above the plus 100 level. Its bearish zone is below the zero line
or, if you want to make it less prone to whipsaws, below the minus 100 level.
Divergences show that the leadership of the current trend is becoming weaker.
Both the S&P 500 and the NH-NL rallied to new highs in area D, but in area E, only
the S&P reached a new high— this bearish divergence of NH-NL gave a sell signal.
Both the S&P 500 and the NH-NL fell to new lows in area G, but in area H, only
the S&P fell to a lower low; NH-NL bottomed out at a higher level, and its bullish
divergence flashed a buy signal.
Answer 6-4: 2
The EMA is rising and the NH-NL Index is positive, showing that the bulls are in
charge. The New High–New Low Index has just rallied to a new high for the current
move, showing that the bullish leadership is becoming stronger. Prices are already
above value, but still close enough to it to make going long a realistic choice.
Answer 6-5: C (1, 2, and 3)
The A/D line measures mass participation in rallies and declines. A stock market
rally is likely to persist when the A/D line rises to a new high, while a decline is
likely to continue when the A/D line falls to a new low. Traders need to monitor the
pattern of A/D peaks and valleys because its absolute level depends mainly on its
starting date. The A/D line tracks only price changes, not volume.
Answer 6-6: B (1 and 3)
Uptrends attract traders, and poorly capitalized newcomers enter the market in
droves near major peaks. Many of them double up at the worst possible time. As
Humphrey Neill put it, “When everyone thinks alike, everyone is likely to be wrong.”
When bullish consensus reaches a record peak, a savvy trader starts taking profits on
long positions and looking for shorting opportunities. He knows that the record high
bullish consensus means that bulls are already loaded with stocks and can hardly buy
more to support the uptrend.
Answer 6-7: A
The structure of the derivatives markets, including futures, ensures that the number
of long and short contracts is always equal. If 75 percent of market participants are
bullish, then there are three times more bulls than bears. In that case, an average bear
is short three times as many contracts as an average bull is long. It shows that the big
money is on the bearish side. Big money did not grow big by being stupid; it pays to
bet on the wealthy minority. When bullish consensus rises to 75 percent, start selling
and look for shorting opportunities.

GENERAL MARKET INDICATORS 121
Answer 6-8: D
The number of short and long contracts is always equal in the futures markets. If the
majority of participants are bearish, then the bullish minority must hold more con-
tracts per trader. A 20 percent bullish consensus means that there are four bears for
each bull—an average bull holds four times as many contracts as an average bear is
short. With big money on the long side of the market, be prepared for a sharp rally.
Answer 6-9: B
A bull market that has caught the attention of the general public is probably very old
and getting ready to reverse. Markets are often very volatile at tops; scaling into a put
position may be the safest trading strategy. Trying to buy coffee now means betting
on a greater fool theory. Other markets should be traded based on their own merits.
Answer 6-10: 1 = C; 2 = A; 3 = D; 4 = B
Traders’ positions get reported to the government after their sizes reach reporting
levels. Those levels differ from market to market. Position limits indicate the maxi-
mum number of contracts that a speculator is allowed to hold in any given market.
Hedgers are exempt from position limits. Many traders are shocked to learn that
trading on many kinds of inside information is perfectly legal in the futures markets.
Answer 6-11: 1 = D; 2 = A; 3 = B; 4 = C
Commercials deal in commodities in the normal course of their business and use
futures to hedge inventory risks. Large speculators are those whose positions reach
or exceed reporting levels. If you subtract the holdings of those two groups from
open interest, you’ll find out how many contracts are held by small traders who
often wind up on the wrong side of market trends. Corporate insiders are officers
of publicly traded firms and those who hold 5 percent or more of company shares.
Answer 6-12: D
Buying by corporate insiders is a strong bullish sign, but you need to see a bullish
confirmation from price action. At 11 months, the bear market is old. Nobody will
ring a bell to advertise the start of a bull market. As an investor, it’s time to start
slowly accumulating the stock you’ve selected.

SEVEN
Trading Systems
Answer 7-1: C (I, II, III, and IV)
Trends may point in different directions at the same time in different timeframes:
for example, up on the daily chart but down on the weekly, or vice versa. A trend-
following indicator may be giving a buy signal, while an oscillator is giving a sell
signal, or vice versa. The Triple Screen trading system is designed to manage those
contradictory signals.
Answer 7-2: B
The Triple Screen trading system begins by identifying the trend on a chart one
order of magnitude greater than the one you are planning to trade. Find the trend
on the weekly chart and then look for entry points in that direction on the dailies.
If you begin by analyzing the daily chart and only check the weekly chart later, your
eyes will be prejudiced by what you saw on the daily chart. A monthly chart is too far
removed from the daily—the timeframes of two charts should relate to one another
by a factor of five. A weekly bar contains the data from 5 daily bars.

124 ANSWERS
Answer 7-3: C
Keeping good records is essential for testing a system. Start at the beginning of your
data file and move forward one day at a time, recording each signal and planned
actions. Watching signals emerge and gradually deliver paper profits and losses is the
closest you can get to real trading without risking money. If you like what you see
and start trading that system in your account, keep your positions small. Concen-
trate on learning how the system works in the real world before gradually increasing
position size. Since you cannot know exactly how others may use this system, their
feedback is not nearly as meaningful as your own results.
Answer 7-4: B
The entry, the target, and the stop are the three essential numbers for every trade—
you must write them down before you enter. They provide the structure for every
trade, allowing you to compare risk and reward and decide what size to trade.
A trade without these numbers is not a trade but a gamble. Counting profits in an
open trade will only distract you from managing that trade.
Answer 7-5: B
A directional trader has three choices: buy, sell, or stand aside. The first screen of
Triple Screen acts as a censor that takes away one of those choices. You may look for
trades only in the direction of the long-term timeframe or stand aside.
Answer 7-6: C
When the first screen of the Triple Screen trading system points up, use declines of
a short-term oscillator to find buying opportunities. When the first screen points
down, use rallies of a short-term oscillator to identify shorting opportunities. This
rule helps avoid chasing uptrends and downtrends. In this example, the short-term
oscillator is already overbought; wait for it to decline before going long.
Answer 7-7: B
When the weekly trend is up but the daily trend is down, Triple Screen points to a
buying opportunity. One of the options is to place a buy-stop above the last day’s
high to catch a short-term upside breakout.
Answer 7-8: C
The uptrend of Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) on the weekly chart is confirmed
by its rising EMA as well as the uptrend of MACD-Histogram. The weekly uptrend
leads to a strategic decision to look only for buying opportunities on the daily chart.
There we see a pullback to the EMA, while the Force Index below zero indicates an
oversold condition. According to Triple Screen, pullbacks on the daily charts during
weekly uptrends signal buying opportunities. Place a buy order above the latest daily
high. The fact that the weekly and daily trends are in conflict is a normal occurrence
in the markets—it is the purpose of the Triple Screen to resolve such conflicts to your
benefit.

TRADING SYSTEMS 125
Answer 7-9: 1 = C; 2 = A; 3 = B; 4 = C
When the weekly trend is up and the daily trend is down, use those declines to catch
buying opportunities. When the weekly trend is down and the daily trend is up, use
those rallies for entering shorts. Trying to enter a trade when both weekly and daily
trends are moving in the same direction is like hopping aboard a moving train. It can
be done, but it’s safer to wait for a pullback.
Answer 7-10: A
The slope of the fast EMA tracks the market’s inertia, while the slope of the MACD-
Histogram reflects the direction of market power. The primary role of the Impulse
system is not to tell traders when to buy or sell. Rather, it shows them when they’re
prohibited from buying or shorting. It is a censorship system, and when the Impulse
system is red, it prohibits buying. It removes that prohibition when its color changes
from the bearish red to a neutral blue or a bullish green.
Answer 7-11: 1 = A; 2 = C; 3 = B; 4 = C
The color of the Impulse system depends on its two components—an EMA and
MACD-Histogram. When both are rising, the Impulse turns green—bullish, pro-
hibiting short trades. When both decline, the Impulse turns red—bearish, forbid-
ding buying. When these two components contradict one another, the Impulse turns
blue—neutral.
Answer 7-12: 1 = E and H; 2 = A and C; 3 = B, D, F, G and I
The Impulse system is a censorship system. When both the EMA and MACD-Histo-
gram turn down, coloring the bar red, it prohibits buying. When both indicators turn
up, coloring the bar green, shorting is not allowed.
The Impulse system shouldn’t be used as an automatic trading method: while it
catches every trend, it would subject an automatic trader to multiple whipsaws, for
example, in the area between the letters C and G. Its best signals emerge when red
or green colors disappear. For example, the disappearance of red at the bar G showed
that the double bottom was being completed and suggested buying. The disappear-
ance of green at the bar I signaled the approaching end of a powerful upswing and
suggested taking profits.
Answer 7-13: A
At the right edge of the chart, both the EMA and MACD-Histogram are rising—the
Impulse system would color that bar green. Had both indicators been declining,
the bar would be red; had they pointed in opposite directions, the bar would be blue.
This is important to keep in mind if you want to find the Impulse color at the right
edge of a chart using software that doesn’t let you actually color the bars.

Answer 7-14: C
There is no mystery in constructing a channel. Keep adjusting its width until it con-
tains the bulk of prices, leaving out only the most extreme highs and lows for the
past 50 to 100 bars. Prices moving outside of a well-drawn channel identify zones of
unsustainable optimism or pessimism, where the market is likely to reverse. Keep in
mind that on rare occasions the market may stay outside of its channel for a longer
time—but that’s an exception that confirms the rule.
Answer 7-15: 1 = C; 2 = A; 3 = D; 4 = B
A moving average reflects the average consensus of value. A channel tracks the
boundaries between normal and abnormal price action. The market is undervalued
when it falls below its lower channel line and overvalued when it rises above its up-
per channel line. The channel coefficient needs to be adjusted until a channel con-
tains 90 percent to 95 percent of the price action for the past 50 to 100 bars.
Answer 7-16: A
The slope of a channel provides important information. When it rises, it shows that
the market is bullish. When it falls, the market is bearish. When it is flat, the mar-
ket is neutral. A breakout in the direction of the channel slope indicates a powerful
trend; a return to the moving average almost always offers a good opportunity to
trade in the direction of the trend. Swings between the walls of a flat channel also
provide good trading opportunities. Buying and selling at the moving average isn’t
always a good idea. It tends to work when a channel is slanted but not when it is flat.

Trading Vehicles
Answer 8-1: C
Trading liquid high-volume vehicles helps reduce slippage. Volatile fast-moving in-
struments offer more opportunities. It pays to focus on the markets whose main
trading hours are close to your own time zone, so that you’re awake while the action
is taking place. Popularity isn’t a key factor: some of the best opportunities occur in
the markets that aren’t popular but are fine to trade, as long as they have good liquid-
ity and volatility.
Answer 8-2: D
Bonds represent loans, while shares represent company ownership. You’d have to
buy a great number of them to become an insider. In the United States, for manda-
tory reporting purposes, corporate insiders are defined as a company’s officers and
directors and the owners of more than 10% of its equity securities. It’s a dangerous
misconception to expect the price of a stock to rise if the company makes money. If
a company was expected to report a $100 million profit in a quarter but announced a
$70 million profit, its shares are likely to take a hit from disappointed holders when
earnings are reported.

entire price represents hope that the stock will rise above $40. If and when it does,
that call will be in-the-money.
Answer 8-6: C
Options lose value as they near their expiration date; they gain value as the stock
approaches the option exercise price. Options for volatile stocks tend to be more
expensive because their prices can swing more than those of less volatile stocks. How
closely a stock tracks its industry group is not a factor in its option pricing.
Answer 8-7: I = A and D; II = B and C; III = C and D
The person who buys a call can profit only if the underlying stock rises; if it falls or
even stays flat, the winner will be the trader who wrote that call. A put buyer will
profit only if the underlying stock falls; if it rises or even stays flat, the option writer
will profit. There are three possible scenarios for any stock: up, down, or sideways.
Only one out of three works for the option buyer, but two work for the option writer.
Answer 8-8: B
Begin by analyzing the underlying security, decide what level it’s unlikely to reach,
and then sell an option beyond that level. Going online to look up a stock’s Delta
will help you identify that level. You also need to decide at what level the underly-
ing security would prove you wrong and prompt you to exit. Placing an actual stop
for an option would expose you to the running of open orders, which is a common
problem in options. Better write down your stop and place an order to exit after the
underlying security gets there. Consider banking a small percentage of your profits in
an insurance account for the day when an option you wrote jumps sharply against you.

TRADING VEHICLES 131
Answer 8-9: D
The number of long and short contracts for every option and future is always equal
by definition. A huge difference between options and futures is that if you buy an op-
tion and its price moves against you, you can abandon it and walk away, losing only
what you paid for it. There is no walking away from futures—you must either take
a loss or send in additional margin to support a deepening loss. All other differences
are minor in comparison with this one.
Answer 8-10: B
Daily price limits, contract expirations, and legal insider trading are challeng-
ing enough, but the riskiest factor in futures is that people can trade them on very
small margins, as low as 5% of contract value. When your $5,000 deposit controls
$100,000 worth of a commodity that moves 5% in your favor, you’ll double your
money. Trouble is that if it moves against you by a few percentage points, it’ll wipe
out your margin. You must be absolutely disciplined and have excellent money man-
agement skills to profit from futures.
Answer 8-11: I = C; II = D; III = A; IV = B
Demand for any commodity changes slowly, but the market can react violently when
supply becomes threatened. Spread traders bet on a resumption of normal market
relationships; when two related markets go out of sync, they buy the underpriced
one and short the overpriced one, waiting for their relationship to return to normal.
Remote delivery months are normally more expensive due to the “cost of carry,”
such as storage and insurance, but in bull markets, when demand is red-hot, futures
can become inverted, with a premium for early delivery. Hedging is the economic
foundation of the futures markets: a farmer can sell wheat futures long before har-
vesting his grain while an airline can buy gasoline contracts months or even years
before it needs airplane fuel.
Question 8-12: B (I and II)
The forex market is completely decentralized; institutional traders deal directly
with each other, using online platforms. Retail customers come to grief when forex
houses take the opposite sides of their orders instead of transmitting them to the
market—for you to win, the forex house must lose. Wild margins in the hands of un-
sophisticated traders turn into a “get-poor-quick” tool. Forex houses seldom charge
commissions, but many profit from positioning themselves against their customers.

Risk Management
Answer 9-1: B
Emotional trading is the enemy of success. Nobody can get high and consistently
make money. A trader can get away with emotional trading for a short while, but
unchecked greed and fear will destroy any account. Your goal must be to make the
most intelligent trades, calmly weighing potential gains and limiting risks.
Answer 9-2: C
We all like to think we’re smart—taking losses hurts our egos. Taking a loss means
giving up hope that a trade will work out—and nobody likes to live without hope.
Good traders are realists; hanging onto a losing trade is not a sound tactic.
Answer 9-3: B
A reluctance to take a loss is a sign of emotional trading. Adding to a losing trade
shows that the trader is hanging on to a fantasy of winning rather than facing the real-
ity of a loss. For a loser, a dream is alive as long as he holds his position. In fact, if you
entered a trade on a set of indicator signals and those indicators reversed, what’s the
rationale for staying in that trade? It is not working out—get out to preserve your
capital and look for a better trade.

134 ANSWERS
Answer 9-4: C
A series of three losses can wipe out trader A, but trader B can survive a streak of 9
losses. Trader A is only three throws away from going bust, while trader B has enough
capital to sustain him through 9 unlucky throws. All other factors being equal, the
poorer of the two traders will go broke first.
Answer 9-5: B (II, III, I)
The first goal of money management is to ensure survival. The second is to earn a
steady rate of return, and the third is to earn high returns—but survival comes first.
That’s how professionals trade; many beginners have their priorities backwards.
Answer 9-6: D (I, II, III, and IV)
All of these money management rules have stood the test of time. Follow them—let
your competitors violate them.
Answer 9-7: A (I)
Counting money in an open trade flashes a red light—a warning that your emotions
are kicking in and you’re about to lose because they will override your intellect. If
you cannot get money off your mind, get out of a trade. The time to set profit targets
and stop levels is before the trade. The time to track your equity is after the trade
has been closed.
Answer 9-8: C
The 2% Rule dictates your maximum dollar risk per trade. Two percent of a $28,000
account is $560, which must cover not only your risk but also slippage and commis-
sions. With a stop 98 cents away, if you buy 500 shares, you will have enough left
to pay commissions and cover any possible slippage. Trading a bigger size would be
reckless.
Answer 9-9: B (I and II)
It’s dangerous to count money in open trades because it leads to thinking about what
your paper profits will buy. That’s how people start dreaming, instead of managing
trades, and lose money. Moving a target or raising a stop is permitted.
Answer 9-10: D (I, II, III, and IV)
Serious traders place a stop the moment they enter a trade and adjust it only one
way—in the direction of that trade. When you go long, you may keep your stop in
place or raise it but never lower it. When you go short, you may keep your stop
in place or lower it but never raise it.
Answer 9-11: C (I, II, and III)
A stop-loss order limits your risk, but it doesn’t always work as expected. Prices
may gap across a stop. A stop isn’t a perfect tool, but it’s the best defensive tool that
we have.

RISK MANAGEMENT 135
Answer 9-12: B (II and III)
Trader A is risking $400, while the 2% Rule allows him to risk no more than $360.
Trader B is risking $800, while the 2% Rule permits him to risk up to $1,000. Trader
C is risking $400, while the 2% Rule permits him to risk up to $800. Trader D is
risking $1,500, while the 2% Rule allows him to risk up to $1,200. Traders B and
C accept businessman’s risks, while traders A and D are risking real losses. The 2%
Rule sets a clear limit on your risk per trade—it’s an easy rule to follow, unless greed
raises its ugly head.
Answer 9-13: D (II and IV)
The two deadly errors in trading are not using stops and putting on trades that risk
more than your account can afford. Other mistakes are bad enough, but if you use
stops and trade a reasonable size, at least they won’t kill your account.
Answer 9-14: D
The Iron Triangle asks three simple questions: what is your maximum acceptable
dollar risk for this trade? Where will you enter this trade? Where will you place your
stop? The distance from your entry to your stop is your risk per share. Dividing
your total acceptable risk by your risk per share will give you the maximum number
of shares you may buy or sell short in this trade.
Answer 9-15: C
A series of even relatively small losses can add up to a serious drawdown. The 6%
Rule protects you by making you stop trading early in a drawdown. It creates a
cooling off period: review your system, study the markets, and return to them the
following month.
Answer 9-16: A
The 6% Rule doesn’t concern itself with profits. Its job is to manage risk and limit
drawdowns. You will count profits at the end of the month. If your equity has in-
creased, both the 2% and the 6% Rules will give you more available risk the follow-
ing month.
Answer 9-17: B
Losses traumatize traders. Returning to the market after a break you need to be
gentle to yourself. Reduce the amount of risk you accept on each trade. Set realistic
performance targets, and gradually increase your trading size.

TEN
Practical Details
Answer 10-1: B
Depending on how bullish you feel, you may buy a breakout above yesterday’s high,
a pullback to value, or a penetration of the value zone to the depth at which previous
pullbacks bottomed out. It is generally not a good idea to go long above the channel.
The upper channel line marks the zone where bullishness becomes manic, and even
though it may continue, it is more likely to reverse.
Answer 10-2: B
When the trend is up, it makes sense to buy pullbacks below value. The average of
the previous three months’ penetrations was less than $3. There is no point in being
greedy and trying to nail the very bottom of a pullback—catching a $1 penetration
would be more reliable than a $3 one.
Answer 10-3: A
A well-designed channel contains the majority of market swings, making its upper
boundary a good target for rallies. A trade that captures 30% of the channel height
earns an A. In an uptrend, we should expect prices to rise by a greater amount above
the EMA than they dipped below it on a pullback. By the time the moving average
turns down, a paper profit may turn into a loss.

138 ANSWERS
Answer 10-4: D
With long-term position trades, one has to be leery of using such profit-taking tools
as moving averages, envelopes, and indicator divergences. If you plan to hold for sev-
eral months, those sensitive tools would get you out of the trade too soon. It’s better
to set profit targets using support and resistance zones.
Answer 10-5: C
Setting stops and profit targets allows us to calculate reward/risk ratios. To the an-
noyance of most traders, whipsaws happen, as markets reverse in their favor right
after they got stopped out. Stops provide generally reliable means of protecting your
account, but unfortunately, don’t guarantee limiting your maximum risk because
prices can gap across stop levels.
Answer 10-6: C (I, II, and III)
Placing stops outside of the zone of market noise helps reduce whipsaws. Channels,
SafeZone, and ATRs draw the line between normal and abnormal swings, each in its
own way. Not so support and resistance: buying very close to support still exposes
us to market noise.
Answer 10-7: D (I, II, III, and IV)
Stay away from the crowd: a highly visible price extreme attracts too many stops. So
do round numbers. Place your stops slightly away from both. A stop is a risk manage-
ment tool, and as a trade moves in your favor, you can relocate your stop to protect
a share of your profit. Never move your stop to give more room to a losing trade.
Answer 10-8: C
When going long, you want to buy as close to the low of the bar and as far from the
high of the bar as possible. The range of the day was $2 ($23 minus $21). You bought
$1.50 away from the high. Dividing $1.50 by $2 shows that your grade was 75%—
excellent! Any buy grade above 50% is good because it shows that you bought in the
bottom half of the bar.
Answer 10-9: A
You want to sell as close to the top of the bar and as far from the low of the bar as
possible. The range of the day was $3 ($29 minus $26). You sold $1 away from the
low. Dividing $1 by $3 shows that your grade was 33%—so-so. A good sell grade
would be above 50%, meaning you sold in the top half of the bar.
Answer 10-10: B
Of the three grades for every trade—buy, sell, and overall trade grade—the trade
grade is the most important. Since channels are drawn to contain 90 to 95% of re-
cent prices, the height of the channel on the day you enter reflects a realistic maxi-
mum available gain. Taking one third or more of a channel earns an A grade for the
trade. In this example, you took $2 out of a $6 channel—very good!

Answer 10-11: C
A good scan can find a group of candidates on which to focus your attention, but it
doesn’t guarantee profitable trades. Begin by defining the pattern to look for, and
then cast your scanning net as wide or as narrow as you like. Start out scanning a
small group, and you can expand later.
Answer 10-12: A
You have unlimited choices in setting up scan parameters. You may program it to
exclude stocks whose volume is too low, whose prices are outside of your preferred
range, or whose trend clashes with your current market view. What you can’t do is
filter out unprofitable stocks—this is something you take your best shot at during
the final review process, when you analyze the list of candidates delivered by your
scan.

Answer 11-4: D
You need to define the strategy you’ll use for a trade and set up your entry, target,
and stop. Allocating a set amount of risk to a trade will allow you to use the Iron
Triangle of risk control to decide how many shares or contracts you’ll trade. It is
better not to count profits until a trade is closed—concentrate on quality, and the
money will follow.

The structure of a trade Apgar is simple: no more than five questions, with no more
than three possible answers to each of them. A trade Apgar leads you on a quick re-

but if yes, then work up a detailed trade plan.
Answer 11-6: D (I, II, III, and IV)
A Tradebill is a key planning and tracking document for a trade. You need to identify
the strategy you’ll trade; set the entry, target, and stop; allocate risk; and calculate the
trade size. It also needs to include written reminders of the essential factors, such as
the dates of earnings reports.
Answer 11-7: C (I, II, and III)
It’s essential to document your stops as well as the levels at which you’ll move them
to breakeven. Such decisions are best made very early in a trade. Same with the
diary—document your entry while the memory is still fresh. It is better not to count
profits while a trade is open—concentrate on trade management and count profits
after you exit a trade.
Answer 11-8: D
Most private traders work in isolation and receive no feedback. This makes review-
ing your past trades an especially valuable learning device. There is a Russian saying:
“Don’t step on the same rake twice.” When you step on a rake lying in the grass, it
stands up and hits you on the forehead. It can happen to anyone, but don’t step on
it again. Reviewing past trades helps you remember where those rakes are.
Answer 11-9: C
All of the actions listed in this question are important, but the most educational one
is returning to each trade several weeks or even months after you exited it and re-
viewing an updated chart. By then, trends and reversals are clear, you can see exactly
what you did right or wrong—and use those lessons going forward.

Afterword
N
ow that you have tested your knowledge of trading by using this book, you’re
better prepared for the biggest test of all—trading in the markets. Financial
trading is a never-ending test of your ability to think straight under stress, make in-
telligent and unemotional decisions, and stay in control of the money in your account.
This book has given you several rating scales for measuring your skills; it has
provided a reading list and has allowed you to retake the tests that you failed at first.
The main rating scale of your market performance will be the slope of your equity
curve. The best curves show a steady growth of an account, with small drawdowns.
You need to keep track of your equity and stop trading for the rest of the month if it
drops more than 6 percent from the end-point of the preceding month.
Be sure to keep a diary of your trades, including not only dates, tickers, and sizes
but also charts and your personal comments. This will help you learn from your ex-
periences and improve your performance.
I keep all my records in a Trade Journal at SpikeTrade.com, whose format has
been sharpened and polished over the years. Even if you want to design your own
record-keeping system, take a good look at the Trade Journal to see how a good sys-
tem should look and work.
Keep quiet about your trades while they are open. Talking about open positions is
dangerous because it puts your ego on the line. Once a trade is closed out, you can
benefit from the opinions of friends you respect.
