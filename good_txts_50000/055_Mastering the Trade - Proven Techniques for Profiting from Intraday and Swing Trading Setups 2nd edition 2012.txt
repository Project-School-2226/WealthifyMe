Foreword
In early 2003, I was
attending an online trading
conference in an effort to
educate active traders on a
new class of products called
security futures. I had joined
OneChicago after having
been in the managed money
business for more than 20
years because I believed that



==================================================
                     PAGE 100                     
==================================================

these products would
enhance equity trading in the
cash, futures, and options
markets. Having avoided
these events for many years,
I was surprised when I had
the pleasure of listening to
someone who was incredibly
articulate and thoughtful. I
said to myself, “He really
gets it.”
John Carter was not
speaking about security



==================================================
                     PAGE 101                     
==================================================

futures; rather, he was
presenting his intellectual
framework and approach to
trading. It was a method to
which I could relate strongly,
so I introduced myself. We
spoke at length on many
subjects, including the idea
that his methodology could
be applied to security futures
and that successful trading is
one long journey, not a
destination. John became an
early supporter of and trader



==================================================
                     PAGE 102                     
==================================================

on OneChicago, another
indication of his
innovativeness. We have
continued to exchange ideas,
and therefore I was honored
when John asked me to
review Mastering the Trade.
I judge a book on trading
according to one simple
criterion: have I learned
something new? Mastering
the Trade not only introduces
new concepts, but is



==================================================
                     PAGE 103                     
==================================================

insightful and easy to read.
This is indeed a rare
combination in the trading
literature. In addition, John
stresses that there is neither a
single approach nor a single
answer to successful trading.
In fact, he emphasizes that
before one can be a
profitable trader, one must
fully understand one’s own
personality. Every decision,
from the holding period of a
trade to the amount of one’s



==================================================
                     PAGE 104                     
==================================================

capital to risk per trade, is a
reflection of the trader’s
inherent preference curves.
In fact, Mastering the Trade
begins by emphasizing the
importance of the proper
approach to trading prior to
discussing methodology.
Once the book turns its
attention to the process of
trading, it sparkles once
again. Regardless of how
long one has been in the



==================================================
                     PAGE 105                     
==================================================

markets, there are new
approaches or enhancements
to existing ones that I find
quite beneficial. For
example, from an active
participant in the stock index
futures markets, John’s
unique application of
extreme tick readings is very
insightful. I can then decide
whether to apply it to my
own trading, test it further, or
ignore it entirely. The beauty
of trading is that there is not



==================================================
                     PAGE 106                     
==================================================

one size that fits all, and John
does not try to force fit his
ideas on anyone. They are
presented, discussed, and
then demonstrated.
Amazingly enough, not every
trade is always a winner. The
setup is a probability
outcome that, if followed
over time, should lead to
trading success. That is the
essential message that John
drills repeatedly. Bad trades
happen all the time; it is how



==================================================
                     PAGE 107                     
==================================================

one reacts to them that
determines one’s future
success.
Another point that
Mastering the Trade makes
is that there is no single
answer to the question:
should one be short or long a
market? There are always
valid reasons to be both
ways. The markets provide
some clues, but one’s trading
style needs to provide the



==================================================
                     PAGE 108                     
==================================================

rest. That is why John shows
how to use everything from
monthly charts to one-minute
pivots. A full-time trader
should have different
volatility and risk parameters
from one who can examine
the market only before the
open and after the close.
Trading is an emotionally
debilitating business. One
can always explain yesterday
perfectly. The weekly trader



==================================================
                     PAGE 109                     
==================================================

says, “If I had only followed
the one-minute chart, I would
not have gotten caught in that
position.” The one-minute,
intraday trader says, “If I had
only leaned against that
weekly pivot point, I
wouldn’t have gotten stopped
out, and I would have had a
huge winner.” John doesn’t
play this game. He applies an
intellectually honest process
to trading, suggests
risk/reward setups, and then



==================================================
                     PAGE 110                     
==================================================

lets the markets do the rest.
Remember, the market is
always right. It is the analysis
or setup that is wrong.
Mastering the Trade
reinforces what successful
traders intuitively do every
time they place a position:
trade small, stay in the game,
and try to let time be your
ally. Losing streaks are
bound to occur, but knowing
that they will occur and



==================================================
                     PAGE 111                     
==================================================

living through them are two
different things. Diversify
across markets. Some setups
will be working well in a
market and then stop. The
market hasn’t changed or the
setup failed; the more
opportunities, the greater the
chance of success. But if one
is trading too large, then one
may not be able to initiate the
next trade after a series of
losses. John is very helpful in
outlining what unit sizes to



==================================================
                     PAGE 112                     
==================================================

trade.
I would suggest studying
the list of markets
recommended and being
prepared to participate in
many of them. We all have a
tendency to pick and choose
the setups in those markets
for which we have a
predefined bias. The message
of Mastering the Trade is
that the setups are objective
and can help eliminate the



==================================================
                     PAGE 113                     
==================================================

emotional battles that are
constantly being fought.
Today a single-stock future
will look great on a chart, but
the setup will indicate that it
is time to sell. If you are
looking for excuses not to
follow the signal, then don’t
buy Mastering the Trade.
However, if you are tired of
saying, “I knew this would
happen,” but you do not have
anything to show for that
knowledge, then John

Introduction
The best lesson I’ve ever
learned about short-term
trading happened while I was
on a white-water rafting trip.
Eight of us were in the raft
when it hit a rock and
flipped, launching us into the
air like a catapult and
sending everyone headfirst
into the icy water. Half of us

                     PAGE 116                     
==================================================

remembered that, in the
event of a spill, we needed to
stay calm and position
ourselves on our back, feet
facing downstream. We
zipped around rocks and
through cascades of water,
eventually dragging
ourselves safely ashore. An
hour passed before we
learned what had happened
to the rest of the group. For
them, a rescue operation
went into effect, and the end



==================================================
                     PAGE 117                     
==================================================

result was a gashed leg, a
concussion, and a near
drowning. Later, when
speaking to the other group, I
learned that all of them had
experienced a type of brain
freeze. They could see the
danger around them. They
knew they were in trouble.
They even knew that they
needed to act, to do
something. But they literally
could not make a decision
about what action they



==================================================
                     PAGE 118                     
==================================================

should take. So, they took the
one option left to them: they
froze like the proverbial deer
in the headlights and did
nothing. In the absence of a
decisive path of action, the
river grabbed them by their
lapels and, like an angry
pimp with bills to pay,
slapped them senseless.
I remember one member
of the group saying, “That
river was out to get me!”



==================================================
                     PAGE 119                     
==================================================

Extreme paranoia and self-
centeredness aside, the river
was not out to get anyone. It
did what it was supposed to
do: move quickly and rapidly
through a canyon in order to
get to the ocean. The riders
who understood the nature of
the river were prepared and
took the roller-coaster
journey in stride. The riders
who fought this trend got
thrashed.



==================================================
                     PAGE 120                     
==================================================

The similarities between
this event and a typical
trading day are nearly
identical. The unprepared
trader (newbie) is in the same
situation as the unprepared
white-water rafter. In the
event of extreme conditions,
both will freeze, and both
will be lucky to survive the
experience. One bad trade
can wipe out months or years
of profits.



==================================================
                     PAGE 121                     
==================================================

Professional traders make
money not because they are
right more often than not, but
because they know how to
take advantage of all the
“fresh meat” that is sitting
out there in the form of
amateur, unprepared traders.
“Fresh meat” refers to
anyone who has been trading
for less than 10 years. That
said, many traders never
make the leap, and remain in
this victim-like state all of



==================================================
                     PAGE 122                     
==================================================

their trading lives. The
minority who endure and join
the ranks of consistently
winning traders are the ones
who have learned the
following truths:
• The financial markets are
naturally set up to take
advantage of and prey
upon human nature. As a
result, markets initiate
major intraday and
swing moves with as



==================================================
                     PAGE 123                     
==================================================

few traders participating
as possible. A trader
who does not understand
how this works is
destined to lose money.
• Traders can know more
about a market than
anyone else in the world,
but if they apply the
wrong methodology to
their trading setups, they
will lose money.
• Traders can know more



==================================================
                     PAGE 124                     
==================================================

about an indicator or
group of indicators than
anyone else in the world,
but if they apply the
wrong methodology to
those indicators, they
will lose money.
• Traders can know
exactly what they are
doing, but if they are
trading the wrong
market for their
personality, they will



==================================================
                     PAGE 125                     
==================================================

lose money.
• Traders can know
exactly what they are
doing, but if they apply
the same strategies that
they used to make
themselves successful in
other areas of their life,
they will lose money.
Without this knowledge, a
trader is like a wounded
antelope in the center of a



==================================================
                     PAGE 126                     
==================================================

pride of lions: it is not a
question of “if” the antelope
is going to get torn to shreds
and swallowed, but rather of
“when.” For a trader without
this knowledge, the
possibility of ruin is not a
question of “if.” It’s only a
matter of “when.”
Nevertheless, even with
the odds stacked against
them, each year tens of
thousands of unprepared



==================================================
                     PAGE 127                     
==================================================

traders flock to the markets
like lemmings to the sea,
their heads filled with visions
of easy cash, first-class
tickets, and telling their boss
to go pound sand. By the
time most of them sense the
spark of an idea that would
have allowed them to
understand how trading
really works, they have
already flung themselves
over the cliff and are
plunging toward the rocks



==================================================
                     PAGE 128                     
==================================================

below. All they have to show
for their hard work is ample
amounts of frustration and
despair, perhaps a furious
spouse, and a trading account
that has been ravished and
ripped off by a professional.
Trading is not about
everyone holding hands,
belting out the lyrics to John
Lennon’s Imagine, and
making money together. The
financial markets are truly



==================================================
                     PAGE 129                     
==================================================

the most democratic places
on earth. It doesn’t matter if
a trader is male or female,
white or black, American or
Iraqi, Republican or
Democrat. It’s all based on
skill.
The only way to become a
professional trader is to
obtain an edge, a weapon that
can separate you from the
rest of the migrating sheep.
That edge is gained by



==================================================
                     PAGE 130                     
==================================================

utilizing specific chart setups
and trading methodologies
that take into account the five
key points listed previously,
as well as the psychology of
the trader taking the other
side of the trade. Without
this, as you enter the
revolving door to the
financial markets, filled with
excitement and anticipation,
the predators are merely
licking their lips, because
what they see is a slab of



==================================================
                     PAGE 131                     
==================================================

freshly cured meat, ripe for
the eating. And feast they
will.
Who Should Read
This Book?
This book discusses a unique
approach to the markets that
focuses on the underlying
reasons that really cause
market prices to move; it is
applicable to trading stocks,



==================================================
                     PAGE 132                     
==================================================

stock options, futures, and
forex. In reality, markets
don’t move because they
want to, they move because
they have to. Margin calls,
stop runs, and psychological
capitulation all force a series
of rapid-fire market orders in
a very short period of time.
These generate sharp
intraday moves lasting from
a few minutes to a few hours,
and, on a bigger scale, swing
moves that last for a few



==================================================
                     PAGE 133                     
==================================================

days to a few weeks. These
moves inflict pain on a lot of
traders who do not
understand how this process
works. Yet, there is always a
group of traders who profit
from these moves. This book
discusses specific ways to get
positioned “on the other side
of the trade” in order to take
advantage of these moves,
relying on a unique
interpretation of many
classical technical analyses



==================================================
                     PAGE 134                     
==================================================

and chart patterns.
More specifically, in
discussing strategies, the
book gives exact entry, exit,
and stop loss levels for the
intraday trading of stocks,
options, ETFs, various
futures and commodity
markets, and the forex
currency markets. Strategies
focus on daytrading, swing-
trading, and position-trading
various markets and asset



==================================================
                     PAGE 135                     
==================================================

classes.
It is my hope that traders
at all levels of experience
will welcome this book’s
broad market overview and
specific trading strategies.
Beginners will be treated to a
no-hype reality check on how
the markets really work, will
be introduced to clear
concepts and trade setups,
and will come to understand
why newer traders are



==================================================
                     PAGE 136                     
==================================================

destined to lose money until
they grasp the basic market
mechanics that are constantly
happening behind the scenes.
They will also understand
how they are repeatedly
taken advantage of.
It is my goal that
intermediate traders will
appreciate the knowledge
included in this book, which
is designed to take them to
the next level of trading. In



==================================================
                     PAGE 137                     
==================================================

addition, I hope that
professional traders and other
market insiders will find that
this book is able to clarify
some of the truths that they
have instinctively found to be
true, in addition to providing
fresh ideas to improve their
bottom line. Stock traders
who have never traded E-
mini futures or forex will
learn how these markets
work and how to get enough
information to decide



==================================================
                     PAGE 138                     
==================================================

whether the addition of these
markets would be
appropriate for their own
trading. They will learn how
the futures markets affect
specific stocks and will thus
be able to better position
themselves to profit from
their stock trading.
Day traders will learn why
relying on indicators alone is
a losing game, discover
specific strategies for getting



==================================================
                     PAGE 139                     
==================================================

into a trade early, and learn
the differences that will let
them know when to bail and
when to hang on for the ride.
Swing traders and pure stock
pickers will learn how to
read the ebbs and flows of
the market, and know
whether they should be
focusing on the long or the
short side. Investors who are
overseeing their retirement
accounts will discover
specific ideas for timing their



==================================================
                     PAGE 140                     
==================================================

investments on a monthly
and quarterly basis in order
to improve their returns.
While this book is aimed at
full-time traders, there are
special sections throughout
the book that focus on
individuals who are working
full time and are able to trade
only part time. This does
have advantages if it is done
correctly.
While I feel that this work



==================================================
                     PAGE 141                     
==================================================

will be a welcome addition
for anyone who is interested
in the financial markets, it is
important to realize that it
assumes a working
knowledge of the basics.
There won’t be a chapter
discussing the nuances of
support and resistance, or a
chapter with 25 examples
explaining the differences
between an uptrend and a
downtrend. While I’m going
to spend a chapter on option



==================================================
                     PAGE 142                     
==================================================

plays and I dig into some
basic option strategies, it’s
not my intention to cover all
the different ways in which
options can be utilized. In
other words, if it has already
been written about, or if it
can be Googled, then it won’t
be rehashed here. This book
focuses on new concepts that
have not been written about
before. That said, the work
does provide an introductory
chapter on futures and forex



==================================================
                     PAGE 143                     
==================================================

trading and the types of
markets that are focused on
in this book. If you’re not
sure what a bond tick is
worth, or what 10 euro pips
mean to your P&L, then this
section is for you. I will also
discuss websites and other
books that are great for
getting up to speed.
In addition to specific
trading setups, the book
discusses practical aspects of



==================================================
                     PAGE 144                     
==================================================

trading, such as the type of
hardware and software to
use, money management
allocation, and developing a
game plan that fits the
trader’s personality. Finally,
there is a strong focus on
specific information that can
be used during the next
trading day.
A Few Notes on This
Updated Edition



==================================================
                     PAGE 145                     
==================================================

I first wrote this book during
most of 2005. While I still
utilize many of the
techniques described in the
original book, I’ve updated
some of them, thrown out
others, and added techniques,
chapters, and examples that
are completely new. I’m the
first to admit that I had
mixed feelings about
updating the book. A
common question I receive is
something along the lines of,



==================================================
                     PAGE 146                     
==================================================

“If these trading strategies
are working for you, why in
hell would you want to share
them, and aren’t you worried
that once everyone starts
using them, they will become
less effective?” Those are
fair questions. One of the
casualties of writing
Mastering the Trade was
“the 3:52 trade,” which was
one of my favorite setups for
a long time. As more people
read the book and started



==================================================
                     PAGE 147                     
==================================================

doing that trade, it became
less and less effective. The
main issue was that it was a
low-volume setup at a
specific time of day, so it
didn’t take a lot of additional
volume pouring into the trade
to make it less effective. I’ve
had to toss that one out and
replace it with an “end-of-
day trade” that is based more
on market internals.
However, I left this chapter
in the book because it



==================================================
                     PAGE 148                     
==================================================

illustrates very clearly who is
on the opposite side of a
trade. Understanding this will
lead you to find similar
situations in other markets
into the closing bell. The rest
of the setups haven’t been
affected. Much of this has to
do with the markets I’m
trading, which are highly
liquid. Hedge funds are too
big to do these setups on an
intraday basis, and there
aren’t enough retail traders



==================================================
                     PAGE 149                     
==================================================

out there to move these
markets and offset what the
hedge funds are doing. In
addition, in working with
traders over the years, I’ve
learned that even if you do
show a trader a winning
setup, about seven trades into
that setup, she will start
tweaking the parameters to
fit her own personality—
especially if the setup loses
money two times in a row
(hey, I can tweak that so it



==================================================
                     PAGE 150                     
==================================================

doesn’t happen again!). The
net result is that there isn’t a
massive button being pushed
every time one of my setups
fires off.
In terms of, “Why in hell
would I want to share them?”
I’m not totally sure.
Although I enjoy writing,
putting together a book is a
huge ordeal and requires a lot
of time, focus, and
commitment. I meet a lot of



==================================================
                     PAGE 151                     
==================================================

people who tell me that one
day they, too, would like to
write a book, although most
of them have yet to get
started. I don’t blame them a
bit—it’s a bitch! From
talking to other writers who
have published books in
multiple areas of interest,
I’ve discovered a trend: the
only way a book will get
written by your own hand
(that is, without using a
ghostwriter) is if you feel



==================================================
                     PAGE 152                     
==================================================

obsessed to push it out of
your body. For whatever
reasons, I had to get
Mastering the Trade out of
my head the first time
around, and the same feeling
emerged six years later when
I realized that I had to get
these updates I kept thinking
about out of my head as well.
I suspect the reasons are
both short-term and stupid as
well as long-term and lasting.



==================================================
                     PAGE 153                     
==================================================

By short-term and stupid, I
mean things like being able
to say, “Look, Ma, I wrote a
book” (although I don’t think
she’s read it yet; it’s too
technical). Medium-term, the
book has helped our online
research business, which will
grow only so long as we are
putting out high-quality,
straightforward information.
Longer-term, I fully realize
that one day, a day that’s
going to sneak up on me



==================================================
                     PAGE 154                     
==================================================

much sooner than I’d like
(hey, it doesn’t seem like that
long ago that I was a
teenager), I’m going to die.
Maybe this is a way to have a
part of me still live on long
after I’m rotting in the
ground. I don’t know
anything about my great-
grandfather. Maybe this is a
way for my great-great-
grandkids to get to know me
a little bit. And if they do
decide to trade, hopefully I



==================================================
                     PAGE 155                     
==================================================

can share with them enough
information so that they can
cut their learning curve way
down. Trading evokes
painful lessons. If my great-
great-grandkids can read this
book and pick up a few
things that help them
navigate the path toward
being successful traders
(with a minimal amount of
screaming at their computers
in frustration), then I’ve
accomplished what I’ve set



==================================================
                     PAGE 156                     
==================================================

out to do.
I’m grateful for everyone
who has read the book and
truly gotten something out of
the material and my own
lessons along the way. I meet
a lot of people at Traders
Expos who have read the
book, and I’ve signed copies
and heard the stories. This
book isn’t for people who are
looking for the Holy Grail of
trading, or for some simple

==================================================

system that they can trade
mechanically for the rest of
their lives. It’s for people
who are going down the path
of testing their trading skills
and personality against the
market. It’s a day-to-day
process, which is what makes
trading for a living so damn
interesting. In the end, I’m
flattered and grateful than
anyone would deem this
work important enough to
read, learn from, or critique.



==================================================
                     PAGE 158                     
==================================================

It’s truly an honor.
In terms of specifics, there
are simply things in the
original book that needed to
be updated. The first two
chapters have been updated
with extended and more in-
depth thoughts on the
psychology of trading. The
chapter on technology, of
course, had to be expunged
and updated. One gig of
RAM just ain’t what it used



==================================================
                     PAGE 159                     
==================================================

to be. Technology continues
to change at a lightning pace.
The chapter on commodity
descriptions also had to be
updated. After this, there is
one chapter on market profile
that I threw out—there are
entire books on the subject.
Since the book was first
published, I’ve done a lot
with reversion bands, trend
bars, waves, and a few other
strategies. These are included
in this updated edition. One

of the biggest pieces of
feedback I received
concerned the section on
health—and I’ve continued
on that trend and updated
that section as well as
continuing to act as the
proverbial guinea pig.
Trading and life are
tightly intertwined. The
better you understand
yourself, the more likely it is
that you will be able to find a

or 10 E-mini S&P 500
futures contracts
instantaneously, and it won’t
even register as a minor blip
on the day’s trading activity.
In other words, a smaller
trader can move about
undetected—a huge

advantage. Funds need days,
and sometimes weeks or
months, to move into and out
of sizable positions without
showing their hand. If they
do show their hand, then
other funds will front-run
them (jump in front of their
orders) and bury them if
possible. That is how money
is made in the markets—by
taking it from other traders.
If you think this sounds
ruthless, you are right. It is.

==================================================

This isn’t a holistic coming
together of like-minded souls
to celebrate the meaning of
life. This is trading.
Then why are so many
people attracted to this
profession? It’s exciting, yes.
It’s engaging, definitely. It’s
a chance to make a lot of
money. In a word, though,
it’s freedom. In every area of
our lives, we are told what to
do. Some people don’t like

                     PAGE 171                     
==================================================

that. Traders have the
freedom to carve out specific
niches for themselves that
other people on the planet
can never achieve or
duplicate. Most
centimillionaires and
billionaires don’t have
freedom. They have
obligations, although they
can fulfill those obligations
in style. Retirees have a sort
of freedom, but at what
price? And many that I talk

==================================================

to are bored out of their
minds. Stay-at-home moms?
That’s the hardest job on the
planet (as is marrying rich).
The only professions I’ve
seen that have a large amount
of freedom are prostitution,
homelessness, and trading.
Since I knew I didn’t have
much of a future as a
prostitute (I got nothin’), and
since I’m a wimp when it
comes to sleeping (I need a
clean mattress), trading won

                     PAGE 173

out. Traders, at least traders
who learn the art of being
consistent, have the
opportunity to create an
independent life, free from
the hassles of the average
Joe. These perks are
extremely appealing and
impossible to duplicate in
many other professions.
Reasons for trading full or
part time are many, and can
include wanting a career

                     PAGE 174                     
==================================================

change, a wish to be more
independent, the desire to
escape the responsibilities of
running a large corporate
division or individual
business, or choosing to be a
stay-at-home parent. A lot of
would-be traders I meet are
already successful in other
areas of their lives—they are
just bored with those other
areas of their lives. I call
these folks “doctors who hate
their jobs,” although they can

==================================================

include anyone who is in a
high-paying career. They like
the income and the prestige
… they just don’t like the
bubble in which they are now
trapped. Others have been
burned by the financial
markets and are now
interested in taking control of
their financial future. And
many have put together a
small stake and want to give
it a go and pursue their
dreams of becoming a trader.



==================================================
                     PAGE 176                     
==================================================

I see this firsthand in my
office, watching guys like
Henry go through the painful
cycle from “the excitement
of discovering trading” to
“wow, I can’t believe that
option expired worthless.”
This is a “job” that provides
the chance to make a very
nice living, and it’s a lot
more interesting and fun than
any other profession—except
being a rock star, of course.
But if sharing the stage

alongside U2 seems slightly
out of reach, then trading is a
good alternative.
It can be done from
anywhere that has reliable
Internet access—and as I’m
writing this update in 2011,
that means just about
anywhere. There are no
bosses spewing forth inane,
ever-changing contradictory
orders as they struggle within
a system that has promoted

them right up to—and
through—their level of
competence. For some
people, working for a
corporation is a way to gain
power, which is more
important to them than
financial independence.
Working for one of these
clowns is enough to drive
anyone to drink. In addition,
in trading, employees are not
necessary, although at some
point they can be very

helpful if you decide to trade
many markets and watch
many different time frames
(I’d love to trade the
European session, but I have
to sleep sometime—
however, I can hire someone
to do that for me). Those of
us who have survived the
corporate world can find
nothing on this earth that’s
equal to the freedom and
beauty that come from no
longer having to manage a

==================================================

large group of dispassionate
human beings: “I’ll pretend
to praise you, and you’ll
pretend to love your job.”
The good news is that if you
hire someone to help you out
with your trading, he will
generally be as passionate
and excited as you are about
the adventure.
Start-up costs are minimal

==================================================

Trading in your robe or
nothing at all is perfectly
fine. Best of all, a trader can
choose her own working
hours. Some examples of
schedules from successful
traders I work with include
trading actively from
October through April and
then taking the remaining
five months off; trading only
the first two hours of the
market open and taking the
rest of the day off; and



==================================================
                     PAGE 182                     
==================================================

trading until they make 50
percent on their capital and
then taking the rest of the
year off. The list goes on and
on. By the way, one of the
common fallacies of trading
is the idea that “to make
more money, I need to trade
more.” Nothing could be
further from the truth.
Trading smarter and less
frequently is one of the
hidden secrets of doing this
for a living. There is no need



==================================================
                     PAGE 183                     
==================================================

to catch every move.
Since trading has so much
to offer, it is no wonder that
tens of thousands of people
toss their hats into the ring,
trying to make a go at this
most appealing of
professions. It truly
represents the proverbial
American dream, and traders
from all over the world are
giving it a shot. Since this
book first hit the shelves,



==================================================
                     PAGE 184                     
==================================================

I’ve had the opportunity to
speak to traders in China,
Taiwan, India, Sweden,
Australia, England, France,
Singapore and many other
countries. The bottom line is
that traders sweep aside
political and philosophical
differences when speaking to
other traders. Traders around
the world are linked together
by a single idea—to generate
cash with their mind and to
reap the benefit that this cash

                     PAGE 185                     
==================================================

creates: freedom. It’s a
beautiful thing. I love traders
and all the craziness they
represent.
And I’m not kidding when
I say “craziness.” The
University of St. Gallen,
Switzerland, has come out
with a study that compares
traders with psychopaths.
The study reviewed the
results from an existing study
comparing 24 psychopaths in



==================================================
                     PAGE 186                     
==================================================

German high-security
hospitals with a control
group of 27 “normal” people.
The funny thing is, this
control group of “normal”
people turned out to be
traders. Stock guys, currency
and commodity traders, and
derivative types happened to
be the normal control group
that was stacked up against
the high-security, barbed-
wire-enclosed psychopaths.
In the end, the performance



==================================================
                     PAGE 187                     
==================================================

of the trading group was
actually worse than that of
the psychopaths. The study
indicated that traders, “Have
a penchant for immense
destruction,” and that their
mindset would lead them to
the logical conclusion of
“beating one of the
neighbor’s expensive cars
with a baseball bat with the
sole objective of owning the
most beautiful car in the
neighborhood.” In other



==================================================
                     PAGE 188                     
==================================================

words, traders are nuts.
Indeed if you look up the
textbook definition of a
psychopath, here are some of
the tidbits you’ll uncover:
antisocial behavior, poor
judgment and failure to learn
from experience, inability to
see oneself as others do,
inexplicable impulsiveness
… sounds like a typical
trader who is struggling
against the market and can’t
figure out why.



==================================================
                     PAGE 189                     
==================================================

So it’s the freedom that
attracts traders. And it’s the
freedom that is the undoing
of many, because with so
much freedom comes a cruel
price. Simply put, the
markets cannot protect a
trader from herself.
Individual traders, unlike
fund managers (most of
them, anyway), are
unsupervised and have the
freedom to act unchecked in
any way that they choose.



==================================================
                     PAGE 190                     
==================================================

And for many traders, this
means they live a life where
they are one mouse click
away from disaster. The
markets lull them,
encouraging and even
reinforcing bad habits. Have
you ever removed your stop
and had the trade then go on
to hit your target? Well, the
market just taught you that it
is perfectly okay to do that,
at least once in a while. That
can work 999 times in a row.



==================================================
                     PAGE 191                     
==================================================

It’s the one time where it
doesn’t work that wipes out
the profits from all your
previous trades, and can
potentially wipe out your
entire account. It’s the day
you buy gold on a dip,
remove your stop, and it falls
$80 an ounce. “Wow,” you
think, “I can’t believe it fell
that far!” Exactly. It’s what
we don’t see coming at us
like a runaway freight train
that destroys us. It’s the



==================================================
                     PAGE 192                     
==================================================

classic bad habits—chasing a
market higher or lower,
trading too large for your
account size, not having a
firm idea of your loss limits,
and so on—that creates a
market that moves and
thrives in such a way as to
prevent as many people as
possible from consistently
making money. Remember
the psychopath trait, “Failure
to learn from experience”?
Why is this? Why are traders



==================================================
                     PAGE 193                     
==================================================

so good at sabotaging
themselves? After all,
nobody, and I mean nobody,
enters a trade with the idea of
losing money. In a nutshell,
it has to do with traders being
the best salespeople in the
world. Introverted, yes, but
salespeople nonetheless.
Although used-car
salespeople are saddled with
the reputation of being pushy
and dishonest, they don’t



==================================================
                     PAGE 194                     
==================================================

hold a candle to the average
trader. A trader, once in a
position, can deceive himself
into believing anything that
helps to reinforce the notion
that he is right—or at least
“not wrong”—on this
particular trading idea.
Nobody likes to be wrong. In
a job, a person who is wrong
can typically blame it on
someone else. “It was those
stupid delivery people,” he
says. “They screwed it up.”



==================================================
                     PAGE 195                     
==================================================

In trading, there is nobody to
blame but yourself. And
human beings have a very
difficult time accepting that
they might, in fact, be wrong.
“If a husband expresses a
thought alone in the middle
of the woods,” so the joke
goes, “is he still wrong?”
Probably so.
When faced with a loss,
Joe Trader will look at a
chart and tell whoever is



==================================================
                     PAGE 196                     
==================================================

nearby, “See that spike?
That’s the hedge funds
running stops.” He then says
with a knowing grin, “As
soon as they’re done, just
watch; this market is going to
rip higher.” Net result: he
does not exit the position,
and his losses mount. When
faced with a profit, Joanne
Trader hesitates to pull the
trigger, telling her cat, “The
market is acting fantastic
here. There is a ton of good

                     PAGE 197                     
==================================================

news on CNBC. I bet it goes
a lot higher.” Net result: she
does not exit the trade, and it
turns into a loser. The
mistake these traders are
making is a common, yet
fatal affliction that most
traders suffer from: they are
unaware that the market
naturally programs their
reactions into a losing
trader’s mindset. And they
are unaware of the key
factors that really move the



==================================================
                     PAGE 198                     
==================================================

markets. The net result is a
trader who “eats like a
sparrow and defecates like an
elephant.” This is a situation,
of course, that no account
can withstand. Worse, this
cycle of emotional slavery
will not end until it’s met
head on, until a trader can
“pull his head out” and
realize that trading is unlike
any other activity on earth.
Trading has a lot more to do
with repeatedly admitting



==================================================
                     PAGE 199                     
==================================================

that you are wrong than with
trying to make a lot of
money. Unfortunately,
professional traders
understand this all too well,
and they set up their trade
parameters to take advantage
of these situations,
specifically preying on the
traders who haven’t figured
out why they lose. One
trader’s disaster is another
trader’s bread and butter.



==================================================
                     PAGE 200                     
==================================================

And there you have it, the
four things that cause traders
to lose money. First, anyone
who is attracted to trading
shares the same
characteristics as a
psychopath. Second, the
inherent freedom is
destructive—after all, we
spent our first 18 years of life
learning that it’s better to
follow the rules and do what
we are told. Third, the
markets actually encourage



==================================================
                     PAGE 201                     
==================================================

and reinforce bad habits. And
fourth, traders are seduced
into taking every opportunity
to sell themselves on the idea
that they are right.
There is always someone
on the other side of your
trade. Start being that trader.
Not the one who chases, but
the one who knows that other
people are chasing. Not the
one who removes stops, but
the one who knows that



==================================================
                     PAGE 202                     
==================================================

traders tend to remove stops.
Not the one who trades too
big for her account size, but
the one who trades just the
right size, or smaller, for her
account size (two points a
day is fine, even though deep
down we all want ten). Not
the one who frantically feels
that he has to be in every
move, but the one who is
content to wait patiently for
the one setup that falls within
his trading plan, even if it



==================================================
                     PAGE 203                     
==================================================

means not having a trade that
day.
Be the trader that wants to
make money over time, not
the one that needs to be right,
right now.
How Do Our Odds for
Success Increase Once We
Understand the Pain and
Suffering of Individual
Market Participants?
The problem is simple and



==================================================
                     PAGE 204                     
==================================================

twofold. First, although
traders certainly know that
not all their trades are going
to work out, they do get a
distinct feeling right after
placing every trade that this
trade is going to work out. A
study done by a pair of
Canadian psychologists
documented this fascinating
aspect of human behavior.
Just after placing a bet at the
racetrack, people are much
more confident about their



==================================================
                     PAGE 205                     
==================================================

horse’s chance of winning
than they were immediately
before laying down the bet.
Obviously, there is nothing
about the horse that has
changed, but in the minds of
those bettors, its prospects
improved significantly once
they placed their bet and got
their ticket. Without getting
into a large psychological
treatise on why humans
behave like this, it has to do
with a strong, underlying



==================================================
                     PAGE 206                     
==================================================

social influence to appear
consistent with our choices.
Once we make a choice, we
respond to external and
internal pressures in such a
way as to justify our earlier
decisions. If we made a good
choice, then this process
works out very well for us,
and we will continue to build
upon our good choice.
However, if we made a bad
choice, whether it is
regarding a trade, a job, a



==================================================
                     PAGE 207                     
==================================================

significant other, or a
business deal, then this
process will take this bad
choice and make it
emphatically worse. We will
simply refuse to let go and
move on, as we are more
concerned about trying to act
consistent with our earlier
decision. People can waste
an entire lifetime living
within the justifications of a
bad choice: trying to make it
work, trying to be nice and



==================================================
                     PAGE 208                     
==================================================

look good and not hurt
anyone’s feelings, and trying
to make it look as if they
were right.
Doing and saying things
just to prove to others that
your choice was right leads
down a slippery slope of not
being true to yourself. And if
you aren’t true to yourself, it
just leads to frustrations,
some of them popping up for
no apparent reason. Did you

==================================================

ever get ticked off at your
mom when she simply told
you to eat more veggies?
Bingo. There is some stuff
going on there, and, believe
it or not, it will affect your
performance as a trader.
By the way, your personal
life is a good place to test
this out, and it’s a lot cheaper
than working it all out in
your trading account. Just
start paying attention to what



==================================================
                     PAGE 210                     
==================================================

annoys you.
I worked with Rosa, my
awesome sister-in-law, for a
while on our website back in
2005. We are very close, like
brother and sister. I’ve
known her since she was
seven years old. While we
were working together, we
would get into arguments,
and essentially I would
calmly try to show her why I
was right and she was wrong.



==================================================
                     PAGE 211                     
==================================================

I didn’t think much about it
(because, hell, I was right!),
but eventually our working
relationship became very
frustrating for both of us, to
the point where she moved
on to “explore other
opportunities.”
I had no idea what was
going on. I just knew that
even though I loved my
sister-in-law dearly, I just
couldn’t work with her. I



==================================================
                     PAGE 212                     
==================================================

discussed this issue with
some friends. They pointed
out to me that “my having to
look like I knew what I was
doing at all times” was the
real issue, and that if I
wanted to learn more about
this, I should go to a
workshop called the
Landmark Forum. I Googled
it and initially decided to
pass—after all, it looked like
a damn cult. Then I read that
it had made a top 10 list of



==================================================
                     PAGE 213                     
==================================================

weekend adventures, and that
piqued my interest. An
adventure? And I could see
the positive change in my
buddies, Michael Palmieri
and Tom Tuohy. They were
becoming more effective in
their chosen fields of work,
and they were happier and
more engaging. And they
pointed out that my
frustrations with Rosa were
really a reflection of
something that was going on



==================================================
                     PAGE 214                     
==================================================

with me. If I wanted to find
out what it was, then I should
man up and take the course.
Fine. I didn’t go in kicking
and screaming, but let’s just
say I was very skeptical.
I attended, and I can
honestly say I’m glad I did.
A year later, my wife also
attended, and our lives are
the better for it. She’s
empowered. Our
communication is better, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 215                     
==================================================

we are more open and honest
with each other and not
worried about “hurting each
other’s feelings” or anything.
If she’s pissed at me, she just
lets me know instead of
holding it in for days.
Straight talk. In other words,
we can be authentic with
each other, which is a much
easier and more pleasant way
to live. For my own trading,
it led me to develop a “cash
flow trading plan,” which I’ll



==================================================
                     PAGE 216                     
==================================================

share later in the book. It’s a
purely discretionary trading
concept that focuses in on the
mental game of trading.
Like developing a solid
trading plan, I took from
Landmark what was helpful
to me and discarded the rest.
I also sent Rosa to the
course, and it changed her
life as well. We now have a
much more open and honest
relationship, and we can have



==================================================
                     PAGE 217                     
==================================================

discussions without trying to
be right. We just say what
needs to be said without
worrying about hurting the
other person’s feelings. It’s
great. And that is what the
trading journey is all about—
taking bits and pieces here
and there that make sense to
you, and then turning those
bits and pieces into a trading
plan that works for you and
your personality. I see a lot
of traders wrestling with



==================================================
                     PAGE 218                     
==================================================

personal issues that they try
to “take out or work out” in
the markets. Doing the
Landmark Forum is one way
to experiment with working
those issues out of your
system before you take them
out on your account.
I think there are a lot of
parallels between being a
good trader and living a good
life. The market truly is the
ultimate psychologist. To be

                     PAGE 219                     
==================================================

a happy trader, you must cut
off bad trades at the knees
and throw them on the trash
heap. Clinging to a bad trade
like a limpet “in order to be
right” is like stabbing
yourself in the throat with a
pencil. Think about it.
Second, many traders feel
that they can rely on their
judgment while they are in a
trade. On paper, this makes a
lot of sense. After all, before



==================================================
                     PAGE 220                     
==================================================

a trade is placed, traders are
at their most objective.
However, once the trade is
on, the degree of objectivity
diminishes immediately and
in direct proportion to the
number of shares or contracts
being traded relative to the
account size. Think of it this
way: if one trader is long 10
E-mini S&Ps in a $10,000
account using day-trading
margin, and another trader is
long 1 E-mini S&P in a



==================================================
                     PAGE 221                     
==================================================

$100,000 account, who is
going to be sweating bullets
over each tick? Not only
does the first trader already
have the feeling that “this
trade is going to work out,”
but now she is trapped with
the additional pressure of
having to manage a position
that causes huge equity
percentage swings with every
tick. Traders who rely on
their judgment when they are
in a position that is churning



==================================================
                     PAGE 222                     
==================================================

their brain with extreme
emotions is like trying to row
a boat upstream with a piece
of Swiss cheese—it simply
does not work. Ever. And,
believe it or not, studies
show that the intensity with
which you stare at the price
charts on your computer
screen actually has zero
correlation with what the
markets are going to do next.
These factors perpetuate a



==================================================
                     PAGE 223                     
==================================================

vicious cycle, with the end
result being traders who, like
bad used-car salespeople, are
consistently selling
themselves a faulty
collection of beliefs that set
them up for slaughter.
Instead of following a game
plan with which to exit a
position, traders in this
situation spend their time
justifying why they are right
(if you are married, you’ll
know why this is a waste of



==================================================
                     PAGE 224                     
==================================================

time) and will end up closing
a position only for one of two
reasons. First, the pain of
holding becomes so great
that they cannot “take it” any
longer. Once they reach this
“uncle” point, they start
frantically banging their
keyboard to sell (or cover)
“at the market” in order to
relieve the pain. Second,
their broker politely offers to
help them out by giving them
a phone call, gently letting



==================================================
                     PAGE 225                     
==================================================

them know that they should
exit their position. This is
also called “getting a margin
call.” This trade is also
placed “at the market.” In
these situations, there is no
plan, no thought, and no
objectivity. There’s just a
batch of forced sell orders or,
in the case of someone who
is short, a batch of forced
buy orders, or covering. This
act of capitulation—traders
exiting a position because



==================================================
                     PAGE 226                     
==================================================

they have to, not because
they want to—is emotions-
based trading at its finest,
and this is what moves the
market. Whether it is a
sustained multimonth move
to the downside because of
continuous capitulation
selling or a quick 10-minute
rally because of shorts being
forced to cover, these acts are
responsible for the major
moves in all markets, in all
time frames. In the end,



==================================================
                     PAGE 227                     
==================================================

markets don’t move because
they want to. They move
because they have to.
The pressure from traders
who are trying to act
“consistent with their
original choice,” combined
with that from traders who
are trading way too big for
their account, leads to more
disasters in trading than
anything else. However, right
on the other side of disaster



==================================================
                     PAGE 228                     
==================================================

is opportunity. For 20 traders
who are blowing up their
account, there is another
trader out there on the
opposite side of that blowup.
After all, the money doesn’t
just disappear. It simply
flows into another account—
an account that utilizes
setups that specifically take
advantage of human nature.
One person’s panic stop loss
is another trader’s entry
level.

case that would apply equally
well to trading today’s hot
stocks such as PCLN
(Priceline) or GC (gold
futures) or anything else that
is actively traded today. I did
go through and update and
expand the text. Let’s take a
look.
Figure 1.1 is a chart of an
actively traded stock with the
name deliberately removed
for now. During 2004 it was



==================================================
                     PAGE 231                     
==================================================

vigorously bought by one
side of the trading
community and energetically
shorted by the other side.
Both parties had plenty of
opportunities to make
money. On December 29,
2004, this stock made a new
52-week high, hitting $33.45
the next trading day. Over
the next five sessions, it
pulled back to support at
point 3, at $27.62, which
represented a solid buying



==================================================
                     PAGE 232                     
==================================================

opportunity, replicating the
buying opportunity that had
taken place at point 1, with
the same oversold stochastic
reading as point 2.
This chart represents a
classic case of an inflection
point at which a group of
traders has to make a
decision. A trader who
bought the stock as it broke
out to new highs will be
feeling pain, while a trader



==================================================
                     PAGE 233                     
==================================================

who shorted the highs will be
feeling euphoria. Traders
who are long the stock way
back from $10.00 will feel
excited and wonder whether
they should add to their
positions on this pullback. A
trader who is flat the stock is
anxious, not wanting to miss
the next move, and will be
looking to buy the stock here
at this pullback to support.
Take a moment to look at
this chart. What would you



==================================================
                     PAGE 234                     
==================================================

do here? Would you short the
stock or buy it? What would
you be willing to risk? These
are questions all traders need
to know before they actually
place the trade.

Figure 1.1
Let’s work with someone
I will call Joe Trader. Joe has
been trading for a while and
has learned a lot about
risk/reward levels and about
being patient and waiting for
high-probability setups. He
looks at this chart and sees a
decent buying opportunity in
this stock. He has a $100,000
account. Near the close, he
buys 2,000 shares at $27.80,



==================================================
                     PAGE 237                     
==================================================

using about half his cash
buying power and not even
getting close to using any
margin. He places a stop
limit order at $26.20 and also
places a GTC (good till
canceled) sell order at
$32.60, which is just below
the recent highs. He’s risking
$1.60 ($3,200) to make $4.80
($9,600), a very comfortable
3:1 risk/reward ratio. If he’s
stopped out, he will lose 3.2
percent of his account’s



==================================================
                     PAGE 238                     
==================================================

value, which he deems an
acceptable risk against
making a potential 9.6
percent return on the trade.
The next day, January 7,
2005, the stock gaps lower,
opening at $23.78, well
below Joe’s stop limit order.
(See Figure 1.2.) This leaves
Joe in the stock, as his stop
limit order won’t fire unless
the stock rallies back to
$26.20. (A stop market order



==================================================
                     PAGE 239                     
==================================================

at $26.20 would have been
liquidated at the open at the
market price, incurring a
larger loss.)
Joe doesn’t panic. He’s
been down this road before.
He is negative on his trade,
but it’s not the end of the
world. He gets that he is
going to lose money on this
trade, and he’s not going to
do anything stupid like triple
down to bring down his



==================================================
                     PAGE 240                     
==================================================

average cost. He is going to
follow his plan and take his
stop loss like a man. He is
trying to exit gracefully. “Do
I dump the stock here,” he
wonders, “or do I wait for a
small retracement?” He
understands that when stocks
break down, they will almost
always retrace a portion of
the move before ultimately
moving lower. He might
even be able to get out at his
original stop loss. He checks



==================================================
                     PAGE 241                     
==================================================

the daily chart and sees that
the stochastic is oversold,
setting the stock up for a
bounce, even if only of the
dead cat variety. He decides
to leave his limit stop order
in for this eventual retrace,
and he plans to see where the
stock ends up near the close.



==================================================
                     PAGE 242

==================================================

Figure 1.2
Fifteen minutes before the
closing bell, he checks the
stock and notices that it
never reached his stop limit
order, but it also bounced off
its lows on the day. He thinks
there is a good chance that
the stock will start to retrace
a portion of the move the
next trading day. He is calm.
He is objective. He decides
to hang on. He is following a



==================================================
                     PAGE 244                     
==================================================

logical plan.
Unfortunately, the next
trading day isn’t until
Monday, and he spends most
of the weekend thinking
about his stock, not really
reacting to the environment
around him. On Sunday, his
wife notices that he has been
quiet, almost listless, all
weekend and keeps staring at
charts on his computer
screen. She flips through her

                     PAGE 245

latest issue of Cosmopolitan
magazine to see if she can
get any tips on how to cheer
him up, and perhaps
invigorate their sex life, but
by the time she is done
reading the insightful
articles, she wonders why
she ever married this
submissive little mouse of a
man in the first place. The
guys in the articles are so
much more daring and fun,
and, best of all, it sounds like



==================================================
                     PAGE 246                     
==================================================

they don’t spend a lot of time
staring at charts. By the time
she goes to bed Sunday
night, she is angry. She calls
out, “Are you coming to bed,
honey?”
Joe, oblivious, is still up
looking at a chart. “Still
doing research, babe,” he
tells her.
Monday morning finally
arrives. Joe jumps out of bed
early after a restless sleep,



==================================================
                     PAGE 247                     
==================================================

just in time to see that the
stock is trading lower
premarket. It gaps down by
almost $3.00 at the open of
the regular session. (See
Figure 1.3.) Joe looks at this
and shakes his head. Now he
knows he’s in trouble. How
could this have happened?



==================================================

==================================================

Figure 1.3
As Joe numbly sips his
coffee, he looks at the chart
“objectively” and sees all the
reasons why the stock should
bounce. It’s now down by
more than 40 percent from its
all-time highs in only seven
days. It’s near major support
on the daily charts. The daily
stochastic is now deeply
oversold. He is realistic. He
knows this stock is done for,



==================================================
                     PAGE 250                     
==================================================

and he knows he is going to
lose money on this trade, but
he also knows that at some
point the stock will at least
retrace, and he will be able to
exit gracefully and keep his
losses to a minimum. He
watches the stock all day,
chewing his dirty nails,
slurping cold coffee and
warm Red Bull, and getting
nothing done. The stock
closes at more than $6.00
below his stop. Aghast, he



==================================================
                     PAGE 251                     
==================================================

locks up. This is not a
situation he remotely
believed could happen with
this trade. He simply can’t
sell this stock now. The loss
is just too big. He decides to
hang on for another day, as
the stock is way, way
overdue for a bounce.

Figure 1.4
It is not until he hears the
garage door opening
downstairs that he
remembers that he was
supposed to drop off his
wife’s pile of clothes at the
cleaners. He grabs them,
pauses in the entryway, and
races out the front door,
timing it perfectly so that she
doesn’t see him.
On Tuesday, January 11,



==================================================
                     PAGE 254                     
==================================================

the stock (okay, it’s TASR)
gaps down yet another 3
points, opening at $17.01.
(See Figure 1.4.) Joe takes a
deep breath and grits his
teeth. A part of him seems to
die a small death. He is dead
tired from not being able to
sleep last night, and to top it
off, his wife has suddenly
been acting downright
hostile. He wonders if she
saw his P&L on the
computer screen, but he’s



==================================================
                     PAGE 255                     
==================================================

confident that he’s kept that
covered up really well,
always minimizing his
execution platform when he
leaves the room. He knows
he should talk to her, and he
will, as soon as he exits this
position and goes flat. After
all, she is the one holding
down a real job so that he
can pursue his dream of
becoming a trader.
He focuses on the chart.



==================================================
                     PAGE 256                     
==================================================

He tells himself not to panic
like a stupid newbie and to
react like a professional
trader. He knows he will
never let himself get into a
situation like this again, ever,
ever, ever. But in the
meantime, he has to keep a
cool head and get out of this
mess. He asks God for help,
though from past experience
he suspects that He doesn’t
care much about the financial
markets.



==================================================
                     PAGE 257                     
==================================================

Joe reflects that over the
past four months, he has been
able to generate an income
averaging $5,000 per month
from his trading account. If
he closes out his TASR
position here at $17.00, he
will be down $21,600 on just
this one trade. It would take
him more than four months
just to rebuild his capital. He
says to himself, “Okay,
forget about your original
order. Let’s say you just



==================================================
                     PAGE 258                     
==================================================

entered the trade here. What
would be a reasonable
target?” He quickly sets up a
series of Fibonacci
retracement lines on his chart
to see where the 50 percent
retracement level of the
entire move down is. That
level is $22.79, well below
his original stop, but if the
stock rallies to that level, it
means $11,580 in recovered
open losses, leaving him with
just a $10,020 “hard loss” to



==================================================
                     PAGE 259                     
==================================================

make back instead of
$21,600. Okay, that makes
some sense. He starts to feel
better and places his new sell
order, confident that this is
going to work. He sits back
to watch the action. He
contemplates doubling down
… and almost does it. But
he’s learned the hard way
that it’s not the right thing to
do. He holds back. He waits.
Amazingly, the stock



==================================================
                     PAGE 260                     
==================================================

continues to drift lower
during the day. Joe stares at
the chart, getting quite close
to his screens. He is blinking
about once every 30 minutes.
He now has it on seven
different time frames,
continually reminding
himself to keep a cool head,
that the stock is desperately
oversold and that it will soon
bounce. Be patient; wait for
the retracement; don’t be an
idiot and sell at the dead



==================================================
                     PAGE 261                     
==================================================

lows.
As the markets near the
close, TASR breaks new
intraday lows yet again,
cracking $14.00 a share. Joe
pushes back from his desk
and yells in disgust, “This is
freaking impossible!” TASR
is down by nearly 60 percent
in eight days. About to
explode with rage, he
realizes he simply cannot
deal with this any longer. His



==================================================
                     PAGE 262                     
==================================================

nervous system is a wreck,
and his neck muscles feel
like plywood. He sells near
the close for $14.02, a mind-
numbing loss of $27,560. He
still cannot believe how far
and how fast TASR has
fallen. How much lower can
it go? Is this company going
bankrupt? Is it going to be
the next Enron?
On impulse, he looks at
the weekly chart and notices



==================================================
                     PAGE 263                     
==================================================

that there isn’t any support
until $10.00 a share. He
immediately reverses and
goes short 4,000 shares at
$14.04, just minutes before
the closing bell. Although
disgusted with himself, he
feels better now that he has
taken action, and at least he
won’t miss out on the
remaining down move for
this stock. He is anxious to
see where TASR opens the
next day. Maybe they’ll



==================================================

He decides not to tell his
wife about any of this, but he
does leave a Post-it note on

hesitation, he also scribbles
the words, “Buy flowers for

TASR opens flat the next

day, and then steadily starts
to rally. (See Figure 1.5.) Joe
is confident that the rally will
be short-lived. However, he
does place a stop just above
yesterday’s highs. This time
he places a stop market
order, as it was the stop limit
order that got him in trouble
in the first place. He feels
very confident that this trade
is going to work out. This is
a good horse!



==================================================
                     PAGE 268                     
==================================================

TASR closes near its
highs on January 12, but it
does not exceed the previous
day’s highs, so Joe’s stop is
not hit. He can’t believe his
bad luck, although he is still
optimistic that this trade will
work out. He certainly hopes
the stock will gap down the
next day. His wife calls to
say that she is going out with
the girls. He grabs a bottle of
Grey Goose from the freezer
and turns on HBO to see how

Well, the next day comes
around, and the stock gaps up
by almost $4.00. Joe’s stop
order gets him out at the
open, as this turns into a
market order when the price
is above his stop, which is
$20.83. He lost $6.79 on the
play. On 4,000 shares, that is
$27,160, nearly identical to
the loss on his first trade. His



==================================================
                     PAGE 270                     
==================================================

$100,000 trading account is
now down to $45,280. He
needs to make 121 percent
just to get back to breakeven.
He is so angry that he doesn’t
know what to do, and
eventually he picks up his
keyboard and slams it against
the wall. About an hour later,
his wife calls to say that they
should seek counseling. Joe
pours himself a large shot of
Don Julios (since he’s now
out of Grey Goose) and



==================================================
                     PAGE 271                     
==================================================

contemplates the meaning of
life. He mutters out loud,
“What the hell happened to
me?”
Joe did not have a bad
plan, and he treated this trade
as well as he could have—
with one minor, but very
important, exception. He got
the stock long based on a
credible entry method. He
used a low-risk entry point,
had a great risk/reward ratio,



==================================================
                     PAGE 272                     
==================================================

and was risking only 3
percent of his portfolio. He
didn’t even get a margin call
like many traders did in this
same situation. The bottom
line is, it was a great plan,
but it turned into a disaster.
This is something that could
happen to any trader. It’s not
the fault of Joe Trader that
the stock gapped through his
stop. However, once it
happened, he stopped
focusing on the risk and



==================================================
                     PAGE 273                     
==================================================

instead focused only on the
gain—in this case, how
much of his loss he could
make back. It was this small
detail that derailed an
otherwise solid trading plan
and blinded him to the
possibility of ruin. “Live to
fight another day” is the
mantra of all traders who
have survived their first 10
years dancing with the
markets.

A Note from My Wife: How
Have I Dealt with Being
Married to John Carter the
Trader?
For those of you who are
beginning or well on your
way in your trading journey
with a significant other or
loved one in the wings, I
suggest you share this
chapter with him.



==================================================
                     PAGE 275                     
==================================================

John and I have been
married for 15 years, and
we’ve shared a life together
for 20 years. I can almost
map my dating and married
life to John’s level of trading
experience. For many years, I
was waiting to be issued a
medal for “standing by my
man” during the rough
patches of his trading. Now I
realize that sticking through
those learning experiences
has created the life and



==================================================
                     PAGE 276                     
==================================================

freedom we have today
through his trading career.
May you learn from our
collective experience, and be
sensitive to the journey of a
novice trader trying to make
a living at trading.
The Couple’s Trading
Litmus Test
Every trader will have bad
trades, and in most cases, he
will have at least one or two



==================================================
                     PAGE 277                     
==================================================

really bad losses. If you are
involved with a trader who is
on a consistent losing streak,
it would be unrealistic and
frankly irresponsible for you
to just ignore it. These are
some areas of discussion you
can have together to help you
navigate those rough spots
and see if your partner is still
going down the trading path
for the right reasons. Use
these “three Ps” before you
get to the big P, Pissed Off,



==================================================
                     PAGE 278                     
==================================================

that leads to a whole lot of
pain.
P . To become a
ASSION
professional at anything, you
have to love what you do. If
you are looking for trading to
get you out of debt or give
you a quick cash fix, you are
going to get burned. John has
been intrigued with the
markets since the day I met
him, when I was 19 years old
and in college. In fact, even



==================================================
                     PAGE 279                     
==================================================

back then, he taught me how
I could invest some of my
financial aid money in a little
stock called Iomega. (He had
me hooked at Iomega.)
An aspiring trader should
be intrigued by the markets,
enjoy the process of learning
about them, and recognize
whether the lifestyle of a
trader and the markets she is
trading fit her nature. I’ve
met many potential clients



==================================================
                     PAGE 280                     
==================================================

and friends who probably
shouldn’t be trading—it does
not suit their personality or
the type of life they want to
create. If you are dreading
your trading day or becoming
secretive, or if your gut or
your health is nagging at you,
these are all probably pretty
good indicators that
something is not right, or that
you are not pursuing
something you may be
passionate about for many



==================================================
                     PAGE 281                     
==================================================

years to come.
P . Emotional
ERSPECTIVE
management is critical to a
trader. Having activities and
interests outside of trading
allows a trader to gain
perspective and de-stress.
Does your trading partner
have other outlets outside of
trading? How does he
decompress or blow off
steam? For John, that
includes spending time with



==================================================
                     PAGE 282                     
==================================================

our kids, working out and
running, traveling to exotic
locations, staying involved
with business networking
groups where not all the
members are traders, and, of
course, hanging out with his
awesome wife. Allow time
for vacation days and days
off, just as you would in any
other career. Sometimes it
will take the nontrader to rip
the trader away from the
monitor and push him in this



==================================================
                     PAGE 283                     
==================================================

direction. In our house, I like
to call this “the Gollum.” If
your partner begins to look
like Gollum from Lord of the
Rings, hunched over his
computer and stroking the
keys lovingly like “his
precious”—it’s time to help
him unplug. All the
successful traders I have met
who have made the leap to
becoming professional
traders have found a way to
bring perspective to their



==================================================
                     PAGE 284                     
==================================================

trading. Finding a passion
outside of trading and having
a bigger-picture vision of
what is important to you that
keeps your trading in check
is the only way to make it
work for the long term.
P . I may not know much
LAN
about the technical aspects of
the market, but one thing I’ve
learned from hearing all the
blowout stories over the
years is that a trader is only



==================================================
                     PAGE 285                     
==================================================

as good as her trading plan.
Everybody deviates from a
plan occasionally, but
without one, you are toast.
John has boxes and boxes
filled with trading journals
logging not only his trading
plans, but also his emotional
state when those plans did or
did not work. By
retrospectively looking at his
actions and behaviors, he can
reset his course and avoid
making the same mistakes



==================================================
                     PAGE 286                     
==================================================

over and over. I believe this
also helped him find the
niche in the markets that best
suited his own personality. A
loss on the day doesn’t get
me worried now; it’s when I
don’t see John writing in his
trading journal that does.
Rules of the Road
Living with a trader is much
like riding the ups and downs
of the markets. In fact, the



==================================================
                     PAGE 287                     
==================================================

way the markets behave is
often the barometer for the
trader’s emotional state at the
dinner table. If you are living
with a trader, here are a few
rules of the road to make the
ride a little more pleasant—
for you and for him.
Here’s a Quarter, Call
Someone Who Cares
Traders, if there are times
when you come home or



==================================================
                     PAGE 288                     
==================================================

come downstairs, as the case
may be, from your trading
cocoon, itching to talk to a
human about your trading
adventures, remember this:
your deep passion for the
markets may not be shared
by your significant other, and
that can be a very good thing.
Balance is a blessing in a
relationship. Don’t always
expect your partner to hang
on your every word as you
talk ad nauseam about the



==================================================
                     PAGE 289                     
==================================================

details of your trading day.
Just as John doesn’t want to
hear me talk about the 20
fabric samples I want him to
look at for our new drapes,
my eyes might roll back in
my head if I hear about
Russells and E-minis and
Fibonacci clusters while I am
trying to sip on my Pinot
Grigio on date night. In fact,
we have a code word we use
to cease diarrhea of the
mouth related to our



==================================================
                     PAGE 290                     
==================================================

obsessive interests:
“Drapes.” Hearing about one
another’s day is lovely, but
hashing out the nitty-gritty
should be reserved for your
trading buddies. So, cut your
partner some slack; she may
not be the next Maria
Bartiromo, but that doesn’t
mean she doesn’t care.
The Pain Principle
There is a pain scale that is



==================================================
                     PAGE 291                     
==================================================

inversely proportional to
your trader’s level of
experience. It seems that the
less experienced the trader,
the more intense her feelings
of pain at the full realization
of a poor trading day. In
those early days of trading in
our marriage, I wish I had
had a Hallmark card that
said, “Sorry for your loss.
Thinking of you.” There is
not much you can say in
words to make someone feel



==================================================
                     PAGE 292                     
==================================================

better after losing $500 or
$5,000 in a day. But creating
a relationship in which your
partner can come to you even
when she is feeling the pain
of a huge loss without total
fear of hellfire and
damnation judgment at each
drawdown is critical in
building her character and
her confidence as a trader.
Being able to keep her
trading successes and failures
somewhat transparent will



==================================================
                     PAGE 293                     
==================================================

force her to go back to the
drawing board because she
realizes that she is not going
at this alone. If you attack at
each loss, that’s when the
rash decisions happen that
make traders take stupid
trades to quickly recover
their losses to appease
themselves or those around
them. It’s better to digest and
go back with a plan.
The Do Not Enter Zone



==================================================
                     PAGE 294                     
==================================================

A trader’s day can be
volatile, filled with ups and
downs. But certain times of
day are critical, and the most
critical are probably market
open and market close.
During these hours, treat his
trading space like Harry
Potter’s Chamber of Secrets.
Do not enter. I learned this
the hard way. John’s
business partner actually has
installed a soundproof, bolted
locked room in his home



==================================================
                     PAGE 295                     
==================================================

specifically for trading.
While this is a little extreme,
it can give you an inkling of
how serious the level of
focus of some traders can be.
If you want to see a
pissed-off trader or, worse
yet, a passive-aggressive
pissed-off trader, call on the
phone repeatedly until he
picks up or burst into his
trading office at his critical
trading hours. Do this day



==================================================
                     PAGE 296                     
==================================================

after day, and not only is it a
recipe for frustration, but it
becomes downright
disrespectful. Imagine that
your husband is an open-
heart surgeon and you burst
into his open-heart surgery
procedure midstream—no
bueno. During opening bell
and closing bell, a trader’s
level of concentration is
probably as intense, and like
the patient on the table, his
heart and soul are splayed



==================================================
                     PAGE 297                     
==================================================

out there just waiting to get
stomped on by the markets.
Taming Your Trading
Beast
“Raising” a trader in your
household is a little like
birthing a trading beast. In
those early days of her
trading life, she is raw, rough
around the edges, and
foaming at the mouth
occasionally at a losing trade.



==================================================
                     PAGE 298                     
==================================================

Periods of poor hygiene may
even occur on those long
trading jags.
Have faith; if your trader
is consistently abiding by the
three Ps mentioned earlier,
she will begin to mature. My
beloved trading beast John
evolved something like this:

Take Stock
Taking risks and managing
risk is a huge percentage of
what trading boils down to.
In our case, John took the
huge risks and the big hits
very early in our relationship.
It was definitely a test for our



==================================================
                     PAGE 303                     
==================================================

relationship, and a testament
to his character. John took
risks when the things we had
to lose were truly only
monetary. In my twenties, I
could live on ramen noodles
for a couple of weeks if I had
to. I could wait on having our
first starter home if I had to.
However, if you have three
children, have a job that is
barely paying the rent, and
are in debt to high heaven,
you are playing a game with



==================================================
                     PAGE 304                     
==================================================

very high stakes. If you are
making trades that eat away
at your life and the lives of
those around you without
being honest with yourself
about following your
passion, keeping perspective,
and having a plan, it’s not
going to be pretty. If you and
your partner have highly
different values concerning
lifestyle, material goods, and
timing of your life plan,
that’s something you need to



==================================================
                     PAGE 305                     
==================================================

look closely at before you
begin pursuing life as a
trader (or begin pursuing a
marriage, for that matter).
There are many ways to
make a go at this life, and
trading is a great one. But
take stock and figure out
whether trading is the right
path and whether it is coming
at the right time for you.
Determine the level of risk
you are willing to take, and
manage a plan accordingly.



==================================================
                     PAGE 306                     
==================================================

______________
How Do I Top That?
OK, it’s John again. I didn’t
know my lovely wife, Maria,
had been paying attention
over all these years! It truly
goes to show that this is a
team effort, and being a team
has nothing to do with
actually trading together. It’s
about working together in
this game called life.



==================================================
                     PAGE 307                     
==================================================

That was great
information, and reading it
made my life as a trader flash
before my eyes. I think I
choked back both vomit and
a tear. Maria doesn’t trade or
have any interest in trading,
just as I have zero interest in
fabric colors, and it works
and brings a healthy balance
to our relationship. That said,
I did learn early on to just
“get it out there” and let her
know when I had had a



==================================================
                     PAGE 308                     
==================================================

crappy trading day. And by
crappy I don’t just mean a
normal loss. I mean a
situation that got out of
control, like a big gap against
me on an options play. That
way, she would know that I
wasn’t upset at her, I was just
retreating inside my head in
order to dust myself off and
get back in the saddle again.
Trading truly is an adventure.
If you liked Maria’s insights,
you can see more of them at



==================================================
                     PAGE 309                     
==================================================

her blog,
www.renaissancemoms.com,
which covers some
interesting ground on a
variety of subjects.
One thing that clicked into
place when I reached, as
Maria would say,
“intermediate trader status”
was that whenever I had a
situation that went horribly
wrong, it struck me that
someone else was having a



==================================================
                     PAGE 310                     
==================================================

joyous occasion taking all
that money away from me.
Was there a setup in there
somewhere that I had
completely missed?
We saw in detail how the
trading disaster unraveled for
Joe Trader. And yet for
someone else, this was
simply a great trading
opportunity. This chart of
TASR represents a different
view. (See Figure 1.6.) This



==================================================
                     PAGE 311                     
==================================================

is a common setup that is
created when large funds
want to get out of a stock.
They push the stock to new
highs, sucking in the retail
crowd, and then they start
unloading. They know that
the retail crowd will buy the
new highs, and they also
know that the retail crowd
will feel comfortable buying
all the way down to support.
This gives the institutions
ample time to sell their



==================================================
                     PAGE 312                     
==================================================

holdings. By making the
stock look great, even though
it isn’t great, institutions fool
the masses. I call this setup
the “fake orgasm.” It
certainly looks good, but
there really isn’t anything to
get excited about.



==================================================

I use it as a fade play for
swing trades on stocks. (To
fade a market means to take
a trade in the opposite
direction from the move.) In
other words, if a stock is
rallying with this setup, then
I’m looking to short it.

==================================================

Orgasm” Setup?
These are the rules I use in
trading with the fake orgasm
setup. I use this setup on
individual stocks.
Trading Rules for
Sells/Shorts (Buys Are
Reversed)
• Look at stocks that are
making new 52-week
highs. On December 30,



==================================================
                     PAGE 316                     
==================================================

having made new 52-
week highs the day
before at point 1, TASR
gapped up and hit a new
all-time high of $33.45
(point 2).
• For stocks making new
highs, look for a bearish
divergence using a
seven-period RSI
(relative strength index).
When TASR made new
highs on December 30,



==================================================
                     PAGE 317                     
==================================================

the RSI hit 72.35 (point
4), well below the level
it had hit on November
15 when the stock made
its last 52-week high
(point 3). When prices
make higher highs and,
at the same time, the RSI
makes lower highs, this
is called a bearish
divergence. The RSI
measures the power of
the move, and this is
telling the trader that the



==================================================
                     PAGE 318                     
==================================================

stock is losing power.
• For stocks that are
making new highs, look
for a significant
decrease in volume.
When TASR made new
52-week highs, it was on
one-fourth of the volume
of the last thrust to new
highs. This is the
equivalent of a car
running out of gas.
There is no sustained

getting filled at $30.27.
She places a stop 25
cents above the all-time
highs. Since the all-time
highs are $33.45, the
stop is placed at $33.70.
This is a stop market
order, not the stop limit
order that Joe used.

until there is a close
above the high of the low

chart. We take a look at
this briefly here, but this
is a concept I talk about
in much detail later in
the book.

==================================================

Let’s now take a look at
Joanne Trader, who was on
the opposite side of Joe’s
trade. After she entered
TASR short, the stock never
rallied enough to close above
the previous day’s highs. So
Joanne was still in the stock
short once it broke key
support on the daily charts in
the form of the key uptrend
line. Once it broke this key
support level, the selling got
ugly.

Figure 1.7 is a 60-minute
chart that shows the increase
in volume once TASR broke
key support on the daily
charts, at point 1.
During the three large
sell-off days, at points 2, 3,
and 4, at no time did the
market rally enough to close
above the high of the low 60-
minute bar. The next day, at
point 5, TASR rallied enough
to close above the previous



==================================================
                     PAGE 326                     
==================================================

60-minute bar, which was the
low bar of the entire move
down. This close was the
signal to cover, and once the
next bar opened, Joanne
covered her 2,000 shares of
TASR at $16.17, pocketing
$28,200. She also reversed
and went long 4,000 shares at
this same level, using the
lows of the move as a stop.
She stayed in the move
until the 60-minute price

action created a close below
the low of the high 60-
minute bar. This happened
the next day at point 6, and
Joanne closed out her long at
$20.54 for a profit of
$17,480. As Joe was berating
himself for being such a
stupid fool and sitting
through his first day of
marriage counseling, Joanne
was counting her profits,
totaling $45,680, and wiring
a portion of them out of her

When a trader loses
money, it isn’t gone. It has
just been moved into another
trader’s account. This is true
even of the great financial

lost by AIG was simply a

Sachs’s books. When AIG
couldn’t pay the loss, the

this stock to sell covered
calls were the main victims.
Covered call writing was one
of the most reliable forms of
income generation for most
of 2004. This was because
the market was choppy and
didn’t go anywhere. Because
this method was doing so
well, Wall Street announced
plans to start a couple of
mutual funds that specialized
in covered calls. Although
there are no guarantees in the

==================================================

markets, here is one “almost”
guarantee: as soon as Wall
Street announces a special
vehicle for trading a
particular market or strategy,
then that market or strategy
is done for. Once the covered
call funds got started, the
markets roared higher during
the last two months of 2004,
invalidating this strategy as
the best way to take
advantage of current market
conditions. Another

example? Wall Street’s
pushing of home-loan-
backed CMOs (collateralized
mortgage obligations) was a
clear signal that the housing
market was about to go in the
toilet. The moral of the
story? When Wall Street
decides to package
something up, put a bow on
it, and sell it to the public,
that move is over. But I
digress.

TASR lost 60 percent of
its value because a lot of
people were caught on the
long side, like Joe Trader,
and froze. Many of them
didn’t make a conscious
decision to sell the stock.
They held on until they
couldn’t take the pain any
longer, or their brokers got
them out because of margin
calls. It was the margin calls
that caused the worst of the
selling when TASR closed

near $14.00 a share. These
forced market orders caused
riplike movements in the
stock that resulted in even
worse fills for traders like
Joe, who were trying to use
their skills to finesse their
way out of the trade.
Disgusted with
themselves and red in the
face, the victims of these
trades stalked off to
contemplate the insanity of

==================================================

the universe. Meanwhile, as
we saw, another group of
traders took the opposite side
of this “capitulation trade”
and made great profits. How
does a trader get on the
winning side of these trades?
To fully understand how to
do this, we must first step
back and understand how the
markets really work, and
why traders continually and
instinctively sabotage
themselves in the first place.



==================================================
                     PAGE 336                     
==================================================

Well, the first part is easy.
The markets are not that
complex, and they work very
simply. Markets rise on a
day-to-day basis because
current demand exceeds
current supply—period. It
has nothing to do with being
in a secular bear market or a
cyclical bull market, high
price/earnings ratios (P/Es),
or Maria Bartiromo’s choice
of a necklace. (For anyone
who actively traded during



==================================================
                     PAGE 337                     
==================================================

the dot.com bubble, traders
would look for a rally when
Maria wore pearls. Very
rational, of course.) It has
everything to do with what
traders are willing to pay for
a particular market or an
individual stock today.
It doesn’t matter whether
the demand is falsely created
by a hedge fund “taking the
street” (buying large amounts
of a single stock to drain a

market maker of its
inventory, forcing it to buy
the stock back at a higher
price), a squeeze that whacks
shorts and forces them to
cover, or a rumor that a
biotech stock is being
cornered by Martha Stewart.
Demand is demand, and that
is what drives markets
higher. The inverse is equally
true: if there is too much
supply in the market, prices
will fall. The best source of

                     PAGE 339                     
==================================================

“too much supply” hitting the
markets is generally margin
calls and other means of
forced selling all hitting the
markets at once, such as the
Joe Traders of the world
throwing in the towel and
dumping their positions. This
is why markets can erase
gains so quickly; they take
the stairs up, but they ride the
elevator down. It is very
important for a trader to
remember this. Yes, the stock

may be acting great and its
prospects may be bright, but
if there are 1.5 million shares
being offered for sale all at
the same instant and only
50,000 shares are being
sought by buyers, then that
stock is going to crash. It
isn’t rocket science. It’s
supply and demand at its
finest.
Trading the long or the
short side is very easy, once



==================================================
                     PAGE 341                     
==================================================

a trader learns to ignore his
own personal opinions, quits
trying to be right, and quits
trying to make money. And
by the way, that’s the hard
part. This means pushing
aside any and all prejudices
about the market and
focusing on the current
supply and demand situation.
When you’re dancing with
the market, it’s best to let the
market lead. Once traders
understand this, the next



==================================================
                     PAGE 342                     
==================================================

thing they need to work on is
their own mental trading
outlook and how they
process this information, and
to fully understand how the
human brain naturally and
emphatically causes traders
to do things that make them
lose money in the markets. It
could be a whopper of a bad
trade like Joe Trader’s or a
series of smaller bad trades
that grind down an account—
death by a thousand cuts.



==================================================
                     PAGE 343                     
==================================================

Either way, it’s the human
brain that’s letting it happen.
To succeed in trading, you
have to get your arms
wrapped around the idea that
your brain is naturally wired
to sabotage your dreams of
becoming a trader. And
ironically, it’s doing this
because it thinks it’s
protecting you. Understand
this and you have an edge.
And that is what we

Just as a chatty masseur is

sharply only when enough

frustration, and rage into the
markets—and creates
fabulous trading
opportunities for the
prepared trader. To head into
this adventure called trading
(note that it is called trading,
not guaranteed income)
without having a firm grasp
of how human emotions
move markets and how
human emotions can
sabotage your own trading is

like trying to hail a taxi in
Manhattan during a
thundershower. In other
words, the odds are
overwhelmingly against you.
The whole idea of this
chapter is to lay the
groundwork for the setups
we discuss later in the book.
With this foundation, traders
will be able to understand
how to control their “inner
demon” with respect to



==================================================
                     PAGE 351                     
==================================================

trading. This is the creature
that mentally blocks them
from following the
parameters of a particular
setup once they are in the
trade. It is very similar to the
brain freeze that occurred
during the river rafting
incident discussed in the
introduction and to Joe
Trader in the TASR trading
example. It is also important
to remember that every trader
has different dominant



==================================================
                     PAGE 352                     
==================================================

personality traits that he uses
to absorb information and
relate to the world around
him. Some traders are more
visual, others more auditory,
and still others more
kinesthetic—they relate to
the world based on how
events make them feel on the
inside. These three traits can
have a big impact on a
person’s trading. Traders
who are dominantly
kinesthetic are doomed from



==================================================
                     PAGE 353                     
==================================================

the outset—until they realize
that this is how they relate to
the world and the impact that
it has on their trading. If you
buy a stock only when you
feel good about it, you are a
kinesthetic trader. Your best
entries will be the ones that
are scary and make you feel
nervous. If you buy only
when you feel good, the
stock is probably near the top
of a move. Think about it.
Near the end of the book,



==================================================
                     PAGE 354                     
==================================================

there is a chapter on tips for
when trading “isn’t working
for you.” In this chapter there
is a personality test that can
help you determine what type
of personality you are and
the pros and cons for each
personality trait. The cons
will work against a trader
without her even knowing it
—until she learns about them
and realizes what’s going on.
In addition, the trader



==================================================
                     PAGE 355                     
==================================================

needs to realize the
importance of utilizing a
specific methodology for
each setup, because each
setup takes advantage of a
different aspect of human
emotions. A trader cannot
apply the same trading rules
to all setups across the
board. This is one of the
biggest mistakes I see newer
traders make. A two-point
stop in the E-mini S&Ps can
work well with one setup but



==================================================
                     PAGE 356                     
==================================================

cause nearly every trade to
get stopped out in another.
Trading five lots per $50,000
can work well with one setup
but be devastating with
another. By understanding
the psychology behind the
trade, the individual will also
then understand the right
parameters and the right
allocation to use for each
setup. Each setup really is
unique, and it has to be
treated that way.

The end result of this
chapter is for you to develop
what I call a professional
trading mindset. Although
we discuss setups for most of
this book, traders have got to
have the trading psychology
nailed down or their trading
experience will be shortlived
and painful. The other
option, of course, is to go to
a purely mechanical system
and have your computer
trade for you. Although this

==================================================

sounds like a good idea, I’ve
found that traders who don’t
understand the psychology
start tweaking the system
every time there is a losing
trade, which negates the
whole idea of having an
automated system. The
bottom line is that if you
understand the trading brain,
you have a distinct advantage
over (1) those individuals
who don’t and (2) those large
funds that are trapped in

First traders must understand

they can learn about the
setup. It’s like two pieces of

pieces have to snap together

again. I’ve shown many
traders setups that work. The
ones who don’t get the
psychology part always
screw it up. Usually this
takes place right after their
first losing trade: “I wonder
what would happen if I
added a MACD filter and
changed the settings of this
moving average. I bet if I’d
done that, I wouldn’t have
been stopped out.” And a

death as the trader heads
down the path most traveled
—that of the never-ending
tweak.
I’ve spent a lot of my
career focused on trader
psychology—not only
working on myself, but
working with hundreds of
other traders. I’ve spent a lot
of time in large trading
rooms with hedge funds and
prop traders, executing



==================================================

==================================================

orders right alongside
hundreds of other traders.
I’ve watched the fear and the
elation and the greed
permeate a room and a group
of traders like a disease. I’ve
literally seen money from
accounts on one side of a
room flow into the accounts
on the other side of the room
as each group of traders
focused on different setups
and parameters. In addition,
I’ve worked with hundreds of

quickly stripped away.
Doctor, lawyer, surfer, or
engineer—it doesn’t matter.
A herd of thirsty cattle will
quickly drop all pretenses
and stampede to get to water.
In addition to my
experiences in working with
other traders, it shouldn’t be
surprising to hear that I
learned a lot of this firsthand
from the best teacher that the
market has to offer: extensive



==================================================
                     PAGE 373                     
==================================================

pain and suffering.
By the time I was a senior
in high school, I’d saved
$1,000 working a $4 an hour
job slinging cookie dough
and sodas at the local mall
and running my own small
mail-order business, buying
and selling rare coins.
My stepfather, Lance,
noticed my stash of cash and
my entrepreneurial spirit and
said, “Have you thought



==================================================
                     PAGE 374                     
==================================================

about putting your capital to
work?”
I had no idea what he
meant, but he was a Morgan
Stanley broker, and I
watched him meet with his
friends every Sunday night as
they visited and mapped out
their Monday morning
buying strategy. When they
told me they were going to
buy Intel call options and
asked me if I wanted in, I



==================================================
                     PAGE 375                     
==================================================

said, “Sure,” even though I
had no idea what in the hell a
“call option” was. But I was
and always have been a risk
taker, so the next morning I
spent my entire $1,000
savings on 10 Intel calls for a
buck each. Four days later,
my stepfather told me to sell,
and I did … at $1.50 per
option, earning a 50 percent
profit of $500. I never went
back to that cookie store
again, at least not as a boy



==================================================
                     PAGE 376                     
==================================================

flipping cookie dough for
$32 a day, less taxes. I was
hooked on putting my capital
to work.
For eight years, through
college and for four years
after college, I maintained a
routine of staking myself
with $10,000 in order to buy
and sell low-priced stocks
and options until I increased
my portfolio to the $120,000
to $130,000 range. During



==================================================
                     PAGE 377                     
==================================================

those eight years, I
repeatedly did a smart thing,
followed by a stupid thing,
whenever I ran my account
up that much. The smart
thing I did was when I had
built up my account, I would
withdraw $20,000 to $30,000
of profits to invest in real
estate (this was, of course,
before the credit bubble
crash, when real estate was
actually trending up).

                     PAGE 378                     
==================================================

Minnesota Stupid
The stupid thing I did was sit
back and say, “Gee, I
managed to take $10,000 and
turn it into a little over
$100,000. Now I’m going to
try to take this remaining
$100,000 and turn it into
$1,000,000. Let’s do this!”
The first time I tried this,
the experiment ended
quickly, much like taking a
Band-Aid and ripping it off



==================================================
                     PAGE 379                     
==================================================

with a flick of the wrist. It
took all of six weeks to grind
my capital down from
$100,000 back toward the
neighborhood of $10,000.
Sure, it surprised me, but I
chalked it up to bad luck. I
rolled up my sleeves and
went back to work. About a
year later, I had built up my
account to just over six
figures, and then I paused
and did the same thing. First,
I took money out to buy real



==================================================
                     PAGE 380                     
==================================================

estate. Next, I decided to try
turning $100,000 into a
million dollars yet again.
This time I lasted four
months, but the result was
the same: back to $10,000
and change. Hmmm. Third
time’s the charm?
A few years after
graduating from college, I
was engaged to be married. I
was in a nice swing trading
rhythm. I had built up my



==================================================
                     PAGE 381                     
==================================================

small stake back into a
$150,000 trading account. I
took modest profits out of the
account at the end of the
month, and I was getting
closer to my goal of quitting
my job as a financial analyst
to become a full-time trader.
At the time, my fiancée and I
were living in Austin, Texas,
but we were contemplating a
move to Korea to teach
English and just to try
something different. We



==================================================
                     PAGE 382                     
==================================================

thought it’d be a bonding
experience.
Then the company I was
working for offered me a
promotion and a transfer to
Minneapolis, Minnesota. We
thought about it, and in our
youthful “wisdom” decided
that Minnesota was probably
a lot like Korea—cold. We
moved to Minneapolis in the
mid-1990s, during two of the
coldest winters in the history



==================================================
                     PAGE 383                     
==================================================

of the city. Outside our
apartment, the wind chill hit
40 below zero, and our cars
wouldn’t start. Inside our
apartment, my fiancée, who
had never seen snow before,
sat. She was miserable.
I took taxis to and from
work and came home to find
her in the living room with a
mask over her nose, sanding
the apartment walls for the
second time. Even I could



==================================================
                     PAGE 384                     
==================================================

see that she was stir-crazy.
Then she issued an
ultimatum: “Get us a house
with a garage so that our cars
will start; we’re getting the
hell out of here.”
It took a few months, but
by May, just as the snow had
melted, we found a house
with a heated garage. I’d
never heard of such a thing,
but it sounded like the right
thing to have. I planned to



==================================================
                     PAGE 385                     
==================================================

put down $30,000 at closing.
About a week before closing,
I sat and stared at my
$150,000 trading account and
wondered how it was going
to affect me—
psychologically—to take my
account down to $120,000. I
was in a comfortable rhythm.
The money I was pulling out
of my account I mostly put
into rare coins that I planned
to hold for years, so I didn’t
have a lot of liquid assets



==================================================
                     PAGE 386                     
==================================================

other than my trading
account. I liked my account
size. I didn’t want to change
it. I had only a week before
the closing to decide what to
do.
As I thought about it
more, I chose to make just
one big trade, enough to earn
$30,000 so that I could take
out the down payment and
still maintain my $150,000
trading account. It was so



==================================================
                     PAGE 387                     
==================================================

logical that I truly thought it
was a genius idea. I would do
one of my normal setups—
just with much bigger size.
And I would watch it like a
hawk. I started flipping
through the charts, and there
it was. The OEX 100 was
knocking up against a serious
downtrend line on the daily
charts.
The next day at the office,
I set up my laptop, poured



==================================================
                     PAGE 388                     
==================================================

myself a cup of coffee, and
watched the charts. (By this
time I’d been promoted into
my own office, so it wasn’t
difficult to do some swing
trading while I worked.) The
market started to rally, and it
hit right into that mega-
downtrend line. My heart
rate quickened. I phoned my
broker and bought 100 OEX
puts at $8.00. Immediately,
the market came down, and
in 20 minutes I was up



==================================================
                     PAGE 389                     
==================================================

$10,000.
I thought, wow, this is
going to work out faster than
I’d hoped! The next thing I
saw was a small kickback
rally that brought new highs,
and the options dropped to
$7.00. I believed this was the
deal of the century. I mean, I
loved them at $8.00! I called
my broker and bought 100
more puts at $7.00, which
put my entire $150,000 into



==================================================
                     PAGE 390                     
==================================================

the trade. I skipped meetings
and didn’t go to lunch. I did
not take my eyes off the
screen. By the end of the day,
the market had edged down
off its highs and I went home
with an open position that
was up around $12,000. I
wasn’t going to take home a
loser, so this fit into my plan
of taking a “green” position
home overnight. In fact, my
thought was that I could
close out this trade at the



==================================================
                     PAGE 391                     
==================================================

open, hit my goal, and live
happily ever after.
But when I woke the next
morning and turned on
CNBC, I saw a green arrow
indicating that the Dow
futures were up +130 points.
I turned off the TV, shook
the remote, and turned it
back on. The green arrow
was still there. Ouch. I was
hosed. I’d been trading long
enough at this point to realize



==================================================
                     PAGE 392                     
==================================================

a couple of things. First, I
wasn’t going to make
$30,000 on this trade.
Second, my main goal now
was to contain my losses. I
knew that this opening gap
had a high probability of
retracing half its opening
range (to where the Dow was
only up +65). I calculated
that if I sold my puts at that
level, I’d be out with about a
$20,000 loss on the trade.



==================================================
                     PAGE 393                     
==================================================

I got to my office. I turned
on the charts. I watched and
watched, and I waited and
waited, but the retracement
never came. Dazed, I stared
at my account. The next day
the markets gapped up again
and rallied. For good
measure, they did that for the
following two days as well. I
don’t remember this time at
all. I do remember at some
point that it was the day
before we were supposed to



==================================================
                     PAGE 394                     
==================================================

close on the house, and I
needed to sell out my
position so that I could have
money to buy the house. I
had no idea what the options
were even trading for (I
couldn’t look). I just told my
broker to sell. By the time
the dust settled and I was
able to check my account
balance, I noticed that my
$150,000 trading account had
evaporated into the tidy sum
of $8,000 and change. At this



==================================================
                     PAGE 395                     
==================================================

point I did what any man in
his right mind would do—
which means that I sure as
hell did not tell my fiancée.
For good measure, I stared at
the charts a little longer.
Maybe I was only dreaming
this and I would wake up at
any moment.
Finally I got up, went to
the bank, and maxed out my
credit cards in order to get
the down payment. I went to



==================================================
                     PAGE 396                     
==================================================

the closing and handed over
the $30,000 check, at which
point the mortgage officer
said, “Wait. I thought this
was coming from an
investment account. We need
to see where this money
came from.”
I acted ignorant. “Uh,
what are you talking about?
There’s the money right
there. Right in front of you.”
My real estate broker started



==================================================
                     PAGE 397                     
==================================================

to get angry at the closing
agent (he didn’t know what
was going on). An hour later,
the agent finally allowed us
to close on the house. I
kissed my fiancée good-bye
(she had no clue what was
going on), drove to the par 3
golf course down the road,
and attempted to play a
round of nine holes. I drove.
I chipped. I putted. And I
threw up. I did that for five
holes. My nerves were shot,



==================================================
                     PAGE 398                     
==================================================

and I felt horrible. After I’d
calmed down, I asked
myself, “What do I want?” I
knew I could raise another
trading stake. All I had to do
was sell one of my real estate
holdings. But did I want to
continue to go down this
road of uncertainty? How
could I quit my job and rely
on a trading income if I did
stupid crap like this?
I loved—and still love—



==================================================
                     PAGE 399                     
==================================================

analyzing the markets. I love
placing and managing the
trade. It’s an intellectual
challenge. And it’s an
emotional challenge—not
letting your emotions
actually zip down your arm
and into your fingertips and
onto the keyboard. But most
of all, it’s where my passion
lies, and where it has lain
since I placed my first trade.
Still, I decided that I



==================================================
                     PAGE 400                     
==================================================

wouldn’t trade again until I
figured out what I’d been
doing right and wrong up to
this point. I knew I could
make money trading—why
couldn’t I keep it? For the
next year, I thought, studied,
talked to other successful
traders, and read.
During this time I came
across a book by Mark
Douglas called The
Disciplined Trader. This



==================================================
                     PAGE 401                     
==================================================

book was a real eye-opener
in that Mark showed how to
turn everyday stressful
trading situations into
“normal” trading behavior.
His follow-up book, Trading
in the Zone, is also excellent.
His books have had a huge
impact on me, and they are
required reading for anyone
I’m working with. Mark’s
insights, as well as my long
discovery period, finally
gave me the answer:



==================================================
                     PAGE 402                     
==================================================

whenever I focused on the
setups and not the results, I
did fine. But whenever I
focused on the results and
not the setups, I got killed.
Why is this? Once I got my
hands on a decent-sized
trading account, I would start
to think things like, “I want
to turn this account into a
million dollars.” Or even
better, “I just need to make a
quick 30 grand for the down
payment on the house.”



==================================================
                     PAGE 403                     
==================================================

Instead of focusing on the
setups, I was focusing on
making a million dollars or,
in the case of the house, a
$30,000 down payment. This
caused me to jump into the
trading habits that ruin all
traders: betting it all on one
trade, not using a stop
because the trade “had to
work out,” and focusing on
making a million bucks
instead of waiting patiently
for a high-probability trade



==================================================
                     PAGE 404                     
==================================================

setup. All of these habits
guarantee trading failure in
the long run. Yes, it would
have been easier to just
blame it on my mother for
hitting me with a wooden
spoon once when I was a kid,
but at some point we have to
step up and take
responsibility for our own
actions. By focusing on
“making money,” a trader
will see a lot of opportunity
where there is none.



==================================================
                     PAGE 405                     
==================================================

Once this revelation sank
in, I started to do two things
differently. First, I started
wiring any profits out of my
trading account at the end of
each week. This kept me
focused on producing a
smaller, steady income, as
opposed to making a grand
killing. I later refined this
and today call it “cash flow
trading,” and I’ll talk more
about this specific trading
methodology shortly. (In



==================================================
                     PAGE 406                     
==================================================

trading, there is trading for
cash flow and trading to
create wealth—they are very
different.)
I also discovered that
wiring money out was a great
way to protect profits—the
market can’t have them if
they are safely tucked away
out of reach. I use these
profits mostly for longer-
term investments like land
and gold, but I also set aside



==================================================
                     PAGE 407                     
==================================================

some of the money for fun—
after all, we are only here
once, as far as I know. And
one important thing I realized
from another successful
trader is that there is no need
to trade every day. I started
to notice that there were days
when I didn’t take a trade—
not because I didn’t want to,
but simply because the setup
I was waiting for didn’t
occur.



==================================================
                     PAGE 408                     
==================================================

Second, I started a
competition among the
various setups I used. This
way, I could measure the
performance of every one of
my setups at the end of each
month. The setups that made
money I kept using. The
setups that lost money I
dumped. This was incredibly
important to my trading. The
only way I could keep my
competition going was to
execute my trade setups the



==================================================
                     PAGE 409                     
==================================================

same way each and every
time. I did this in blocks of
25 trades. This had the added
benefit of removing much of
the importance from any
trade I happened to be in at
the time. It was just “trade 13
out of a series of 25”— no
big deal. And any time I
deviated from a standard
setup, I marked this down in
my trading journal as an
“impulse trade.” I kept track
of my performance on these,



==================================================
                     PAGE 410                     
==================================================

too. After about six months
of tracking my impulse
trades (wow, this market is
going higher; I have to get
in), I realized that they were
not making me any money
and were in fact preventing
me from making a living as a
trader. Yes, they were fun.
But they weren’t helping.
In working with other
traders, I see impulse trading
as one of the most common



==================================================
                     PAGE 411                     
==================================================

reasons for people getting
their heads handed to them.
They don’t have a plan. They
just get long when that feels
right, and they get short
when that feels right. Or they
just get bored. I’ve literally
had traders in my office who
have visited to work
specifically on their impulse
trades—only to sneak in
orders when I wasn’t
looking. The urge to jump in
and be a part of the action is



==================================================
                     PAGE 412                     
==================================================

that powerful. It’s like a drug
addiction, and like most
addictions, it never works in
the long run. My method for
dealing with them is to
simply sit next to them and
watch them trade—and to do
exactly the opposite of what
they’re doing. At the end of
the day or the week, we
compare our profit and loss
statements, and that usually
tells the story. This is a
win/win situation because it



==================================================
                     PAGE 413                     
==================================================

is a great lesson for the
impulse traders—there are
actually people out there
doing the exact opposite of
what they are doing and
making money—and it is a
mostly profitable exercise for
me.
The cure for impulse
trading is patience, and also
understanding integrity—a
topic that we are sneaking up
to shortly. Patience is such an



==================================================
                     PAGE 414                     
==================================================

important quality for a trader
—both in learning what
setups best work for you, and
in waiting for those setups to
occur. Impulse traders who
cannot own up to this bad
habit need to stop trading and
go to Vegas. The end result
will be identical—they will
lose all their money. But at
least in Vegas the drinks are
free.
If people are stuck in a



==================================================
                     PAGE 415                     
==================================================

relationship with an
individual who berates their
best efforts and undermines
their dreams, then it is time
to leave this individual and
move on. It was in this vein
that I “broke up” with my
impulse trading. I liked my
impulse trading. It was fun. It
made me feel good. It was
exciting. But the bottom line
was that my impulse trading
was undermining my
potential and preventing me



==================================================
                     PAGE 416                     
==================================================

from realizing my dreams of
being a full-time trader. Once
this realization took hold, I
took immediate steps to cut
that cancer out of my life.
This included a reward and
punishment system that I
discuss later in this book, in
the chapter on formulating a
business plan.
In the end, I stuck with
my friends who believed in
me—the setups that worked



==================================================
                     PAGE 417                     
==================================================

when I gave them half a
chance. Once I was able to
follow my setups
consistently, exactly the
same way each and every
time, I was able to make the
transition to trading full time.
A large part of my transition
was mental and developing
what I call a “professional
state of mind.”
Oh, and by the way, it
wasn’t until years later, when



==================================================
                     PAGE 418                     
==================================================

I was doing a talk at a
Traders Expo in Las Vegas
and telling the story about
the “Minnesota Stupid
House” that my wife actually
learned of the event. She was
sitting in the audience, and
I’d totally forgotten that I
had never told her. Everyone
around her started asking,
“Wow, how did you handle
that?!” Afterwards she came
up to me with a sweet smile
and a few blinks of the eyes

haven’t you told me?”
Why Do Most Traders
Have to Blow Out an
Account Before It All Sinks
In?
Trader psychology is one of
those subjects that doesn’t
seem to matter until it really
matters, like when you’re
changing a flat tire or when
your three-year-old daughter



==================================================
                     PAGE 420                     
==================================================

yells out in the middle of
traffic, “No, Dad, I have to
go poop now!” You think the
issue will never arise, or it
won’t apply to you, or you’ll
figure it out before the
moment of truth. However,
that moment of truth tends to
happen at the least
convenient moment,
typically when things are
about to go from bad to
much, much worse. It’s one
thing for your daughter to



==================================================
                     PAGE 421                     
==================================================

say she has to poop in the
car, but it’s a whole new
ballgame when she actually
cuts one loose.
The term itself, trader
psychology, inevitably gets
thrown around with greater
and greater frequency as a
trader nears the goal of
trading the markets
successfully, because the
closer a trader gets to being
consistent, the more apparent



==================================================
                     PAGE 422                     
==================================================

it becomes that his greatest
enemy is rarely the
individual on the opposite
side of the trade. Far more
often—as is the case in so
many aspects of life—our
worst enemy is the person we
look at in the mirror each
morning. Unfortunately,
most traders, myself
included, never realize this
until they blow out an
account. “Wow,” they say. “I
didn’t think that would ever



==================================================
                     PAGE 423                     
==================================================

happen to me.” Seasoned
traders call this the price of
tuition.
The first psychological
issue that traders find
themselves butting up against
is addiction. When people
hear traders talking about
addiction, they often think
about gambling, an addiction
to the rush of placing the
trade, the anticipatory thrill
as a trader establishes a



==================================================
                     PAGE 424                     
==================================================

position and hopes that it
goes her way and brings in
tons of cash. And yet that all
pales in comparison to the
addiction to being right or,
worse, not being wrong. It
drives human behavior into
the realm of absurdity.
For example, placing a
trade that will make money
as long as that market
doesn’t crash overnight is a
reasonable setup and a



==================================================
                     PAGE 425                     
==================================================

reasonable assumption. Stops
can be used. Risk can be
assessed. In the early
morning of January 17, 1995,
an earthquake hit in Japan,
causing its stock market to
take a nosedive. One
particular trader saw this
unfolding, watched his losses
mount, and started doubling
and tripling up in order to
recoup his position and make
money on the trade by
bringing down his average



==================================================
                     PAGE 426                     
==================================================

cost. When the bounce failed
to materialize, the trader,
Nick Leeson, bolted out the
door, leaving a note that said,
“I’m sorry.” This trade lost
$1.3 billion and bankrupted
Barings Bank. Although this
is an extreme example, it
happens every day around
the world with much smaller
accounts. Maybe $5,000
doesn’t seem like much in
comparison, but if that is
your entire trading stake,



==================================================
                     PAGE 427                     
==================================================

losing that amount can be
just as devastating as losing
$1.3 billion. Okay, maybe
not quite as devastating, but
you get the idea.
In many facets of life
having to do with careers, an
addiction to being right is a
strength. It forces us to work
harder to meet our goals and
to prove to ourselves and to
others that we can, in fact,
accomplish what we’ve set



==================================================
                     PAGE 428                     
==================================================

out to do. It can cause us to
view a potentially
devastating setback as a mere
learning experience, and
onward we go, dusting
ourselves off and getting
back on the horse for another
ride. It’s like the movie
Rocky each and every trading
day. No one thought an
uneducated but kind-hearted
debt collector for a loan
shark could get a shot at the
world heavyweight



==================================================
                     PAGE 429                     
==================================================

championship. But he did,
and he proved that everyone
was wrong and showed
everyone that he was right,
and it made a great movie.
It’s a fantastic life lesson in
persistence and in following
your dreams. But if you try
that in trading—try holding
on to a losing trade until it
turns back into a winner, just
so you can prove to everyone
that you aren’t wrong—
you’ll get your ass handed to



==================================================
                     PAGE 430                     
==================================================

you. Maybe it won’t happen
on this current trade and
maybe not on the next one,
but it will happen, and it will
lead to a blown-up account.
True, not many of us will
ever bring down a bank, but
wiping out your life savings
is a close second. Trading is
the only profession that
punishes tenacity by taking
your money. Be tenacious in
learning how to become a
better trader, not in proving



==================================================
                     PAGE 431                     
==================================================

that you are right on this
current trade.
But it’s not just the human
need to be right that makes
trader psychology such a
complex battle, it’s that other
great power of the human
mind—the power of
rationalization. This is a
topic I’ve already touched
upon, but it’s worth another
quick look from a slightly
different angle.



==================================================
                     PAGE 432                     
==================================================

In the film The Big Chill,
Jeff Goldblum’s character
discusses this subject in a
particularly salient manner.
Michael: Don’t knock
rationalization. Where
would we be without it? I
don’t know anyone
who’d get through the
day without two or three
juicy rationalizations.
They’re more important

                     PAGE 433                     
==================================================

than sex.
Sam: Ah, come on.
Nothing’s more important
than sex.
Michael: Oh yeah? Have
you ever gone a week
without a rationalization?
Rationalizing the events
on your screen means
rewriting the story of what’s
actually happening in a way
that feels comfortable to you,



==================================================
                     PAGE 434                     
==================================================

that makes your position
seem like the correct one.
“This trade isn’t going to go
against me for long,” thinks
Joe Trader. “They aren’t
going to shake me out!” And
if it works out, Joe Trader
compliments himself for
being the genius that he is.
He just knew it would work
out, especially this particular
trade. Call it a gut feeling.
And, of course, since it did
work out, it just proves that



==================================================
                     PAGE 435                     
==================================================

his analysis was spot on.
“You know,” he muses, “I
think it’s time for me to up
my trading size on this next
one.”
A person can gloss over
reality in nearly all areas of
her life, reshaping her
interpretations of events to
put her in a favorable light
and keeping that pristine
image intact. After all, it’s
okay to ignore your kids

==================================================

when you’re on the computer
if you’ve got VITTD (very
important things to do)—or
so goes the rationalization.
None us wants to admit when
we are being a shitty parent.
In trading, however, at the
end of the day, the result is
right there on your profit and
loss statement. No matter
how “right” you persuaded
yourself you were, a loss that
was incurred when you were



==================================================
                     PAGE 437                     
==================================================

trying to prove yourself right
is still a loss, and your story
doesn’t mean a thing to a
neutral-minded market. The
P&L is the great equalizer. It
reveals you for who you
really are, and in many
instances the picture ain’t
pretty. Unfortunately, most
people would rather do
anything other than confront
themselves, their ideal image
of who they are. It’s not fun.
Believe me, I thought I had



==================================================
                     PAGE 438                     
==================================================

much better qualities as a
person before I got into
analyzing my trading
personality. And this is why
trading has such a high
failure rate. Flaws explode
onto the P&L. They must be
addressed—not just in
theory, not just through a few
notes in a trading journal, but
in practice, on each and
every trade. The game
changed for me when I
committed to becoming a



==================================================
                     PAGE 439                     
==================================================

better trader on each and
every trade, as opposed to
rationalizing why I was right
on every trade.
The Trader Mindset: What
Is the Best Way for Getting,
and Keeping, Your Head in
the Game?
Great trading, like greatness
in any profession or art, is a
kind of balancing act. Each
trade requires us to split



==================================================
                     PAGE 440                     
==================================================

ourselves into two parts:
caution and boldness. We
need the caution to be
patient, the courage to get in
and the courage to stay in a
winning trade, and the
caution to protect our gains
once we have them—but not
too aggressively, so that we
don’t get stopped out on a
mere wiggle. And most
important is the courage to
admit that our trade is wrong
and to get the hell out. Great



==================================================
                     PAGE 441                     
==================================================

trading is all of these things,
which is why great traders
are so rare. This balancing
act is the reason so many
type A personalities perform
so badly in the markets.
While they may possess
boldness, courage, and
decisiveness, they frequently
lack the caution, patience,
and ability to accept that
their first impression was the
wrong one. Or, more simply,
they lack the ability to



==================================================
                     PAGE 442                     
==================================================

concede that, while their
setup might have been as
attractive as a Swedish au
pair, it just didn’t go the way
they expected it to go. The
market doesn’t care if the
setup was a good one. It’s
still going to do whatever it
wants to do.
Something happens at the
beginning of a trade, a
psychological battle. It’s that
classic scene of a devil on



==================================================
                     PAGE 443                     
==================================================

one shoulder and an angel on
the other. One tells you to
hang in there with all your
might, that things are going
to go your way eventually,
no matter what the evidence
suggests, and the other
screams in your ear to
preserve your capital, to get
out, to take a tiny profit or a
tiny loss. Just get out! It’s a
powerful sensation,
especially for the beginning
trader, which is why a clear



==================================================
                     PAGE 444                     
==================================================

trading strategy is critical. A
trading plan in which you
can place your faith is like a
pair of mufflers, blocking out
the sound of that noisy
chorus. Trading without a
game plan is like swimming
in the Amazon River with a
couple of raw steaks strapped
to your waist. You might get
some good exercise, but the
longer you are in the water,
the greater your chance of a
violent end.



==================================================
                     PAGE 445                     
==================================================

It’s when you’re not
trading your plan that fear
takes hold, and when fear
takes hold, it’s easy for you
to lose perspective and exit
too early, cutting your
opportunity for profitability
off at the knees. Yet fear can
also cause traders to do
something that seems the
total opposite of fear. It can
cause traders to ratchet up
their nerve and stay in the
trade long after signs of



==================================================
                     PAGE 446                     
==================================================

danger have presented
themselves. That is, fear
triggers an irrational
boldness. It takes courage to
stay in a trade, that much is
certain, but the lesson that
too many traders learn too
late is that it takes just as
much courage, if not more, to
get out of a trade that’s
clearly not working. The
greater a trader’s nerve, the
greater his chances of ruin.



==================================================
                     PAGE 447                     
==================================================

I often think of the words
of a great general who said,
“Retreat is a perfectly
legitimate military tactic.” Of
all the parallels between war
and trading, none may be
truer than this one. There is
no shame in taking a small
loss. In fact, when taking a
small loss prevents you from
taking a big one, it should be
considered a victory. If
things aren’t going the way
you hoped, preserve your



==================================================
                     PAGE 448                     
==================================================

capital and live to fight
another day. And always
remember, reentry is only a
commission away. Go flat,
take a walk, and clear your
head. The market isn’t going
anywhere.
It sounds simple enough,
as if you could simply
resolve at the start of every
trade that you will exit
neither too early nor too late,
and you will have courage in



==================================================
                     PAGE 449                     
==================================================

the right measure at the right
times, but it’s actually a
tremendous shift in
perspective for most traders.
We are all geniuses when
we’re looking at the charts in
hindsight. It’s making
decisions in real time, clearly
not knowing what exactly is
going to happen next, that
makes or breaks a trader.
Anyone can tell you what
you should have done.



==================================================
                     PAGE 450                     
==================================================

Great flexibility is
required when you’re
looking at the markets. There
is a certain Zen attitude that
is reached by the greatest of
traders. In fact, this is one of
the terrific, sometimes
hilarious, paradoxes of the
trading world: meeting
serious traders in their
seriously expensive suits,
who amidst their talk about
the hard-core daily battle
between the bears and the



==================================================
                     PAGE 451                     
==================================================

bulls sprinkle in Zen
proverbs. “There’s no
meaning to a flower unless it
blooms.” Or, perhaps more
relevant, “No ego, no pain.”
The people who have learned
these lessons are the ones
who make money in the
market, because they have
learned that when you are
forming an opinion of the
market, that’s all you are
doing: forming an opinion.
You must leave room for



==================================================
                     PAGE 452                     
==================================================

chance. And when you see
that your opinion was the
wrong one, you must have
the courage to get out and the
faith to accept another
difficult truth: the
opportunity will always
come around one more time.
Again, the markets aren’t
going anywhere.
Once a trader accepts the
constant flow of the market,
that endless renewal of



==================================================
                     PAGE 453                     
==================================================

opportunity, then he
understands that there is no
need to enter the market on
half-convictions. Just sit back
and wait until a setup has laid
itself out with clarity. Not a
maybe or an almost—it’s
simply there, period. In the
meantime, a trader’s main
job is to fight off his
boredom and stay flat.
Traders who take on a
position out of boredom then
spend their time managing



==================================================
                     PAGE 454                     
==================================================

that mediocre trade while
good ones pass them by.
Getting in too early and
getting out too late just
means that someone else is
eating your lunch that day.
Your stop loss is another
trader’s first target.
The markets change daily.
Literally—there is never the
exact same combination of
orders and trader actions
from one day to the next. The



==================================================
                     PAGE 455                     
==================================================

gravity of that fact can be
hard to grasp when you read
about the same kinds of
setups or anticipate the same
kinds of moves day after day.
But the market truly is
continually changing and
forming new combinations.
There is an infinite number
of possibilities on any given
day, at any given minute. Did
you know that each time you
shuffle a deck of cards, the
odds are that no deck of



==================================================
                     PAGE 456                     
==================================================

cards in history has ever been
in that precise order? In fact,
the odds against it are
staggeringly astronomical.
Imagine what that suggests
about the markets, in which
the variables are tremendous
by comparison. For that
reason, it is critical that you
take a fresh look every day to
consider the possibilities, not
merely in relation to what
you saw yesterday or the day
before, but in terms solely of



==================================================
                     PAGE 457                     
==================================================

this moment, today. You
must always ask yourself,
“What is the market telling
me now?” bringing to the
table no preconceptions or
intentions of your own.
What Is the Easiest Way to
Establish a Consistently
Winning Outlook?
Just as a professional
gambler is unfazed by his
winning and losing streaks,



==================================================
                     PAGE 458                     
==================================================

great traders learn to roll
with the punches (because
they are so used to taking
them), while managing their
money in such a way that no
one session leaves them
broke.
One strategy in
establishing the proper
outlook is to stop thinking of
your money as money.
Anyone who had a job as a
teenager will surely



==================================================
                     PAGE 459                     
==================================================

remember the way in which
every hour of work could be
translated into a real-life
desire. An hour of work
might have been a bit of gas
for the car, a night out at the
movies, or dinner with a
girlfriend. In trading, there is
the temptation to do precisely
the same thing: to say, “I just
won my car payment,” or, “I
could have bought a new
home entertainment center
with that loss.” Don’t think



==================================================
                     PAGE 460                     
==================================================

of it as money. In the world
of trading, remember that
money is only a tool of the
game, a means to keep score.
Though this removal from
the literal value of money
could certainly be a hazard in
real life, it is an excellent
habit for removing an
emotional element from the
trading day. The moment you
lose sight of money as a tool
of the game and revert to



==================================================
                     PAGE 461                     
==================================================

thinking of it in terms of its
purchasing power, you have
sentenced yourself to playing
less skillfully and more
emotionally, which is poison
to any trader.
What Does Personal
Integrity Have to Do with
Successful Trading?
In the game of life,
everything is in play: your
time, your money, your



==================================================
                     PAGE 462                     
==================================================

relationships, your social
position. Every element of
your day-to-day existence is
in your hands, and you
protect each part of your life
by investing wisely in each
category. In fact, your quality
of life is entirely determined
by the way you handle those
investments. You invest in
your health by treating your
body in a certain way and
asking only reasonable things
of it. You invest in your



==================================================
                     PAGE 463                     
==================================================

relationships by fostering
them, treating them
respectfully and with care.
The way in which you invest
in your life for a positive
outcome can be boiled down
to a single word: integrity.
Integrity is often thought
of as doing what you say you
are going to do with regard to
other people. When you say
you’ll be at a meeting, you
show up at the appointed



==================================================
                     PAGE 464                     
==================================================

time. When you promise to
take out the trash, you get it
to the curb before the trash
man cometh. Other people’s
faith in you grows each and
every time you keep your
word. People who don’t keep
their word are not treated
seriously. If you have an
opportunity for a new
business venture and you
need to find a partner, whom
are you going to choose? Not
someone who can’t even



==================================================
                     PAGE 465                     
==================================================

keep his word on the little
things. Integrity is its own
type of currency in the world.
It is how we show others that
we deserve their respect,
their love, and their
compensation for our hard
work.
The problem comes when
we don’t treat ourselves with
the same integrity. We do
have a sense of self that we
come to rely on when the



==================================================
                     PAGE 466                     
==================================================

chips are down. We have
varying degrees of faith in
ourselves in various
situations, based on how
we’ve handled those
situations in the past. In
trading, it is critical that we
are able to trust ourselves to
follow our plan, preserve our
capital, and not freeze when
the going suddenly gets very
rough. How do we build
integrity with ourselves?
Simple: we keep our word. If



==================================================
                     PAGE 467                     
==================================================

we write down that we are
going to go to the gym at
3:00 p.m., then come hell or
high water, we get to the
gym at 3:00 p.m. And if we
also tell ourselves, “Today
I’m not eating any dessert,”
then we stick to the plan,
honor our word, and pass on
the dessert. With each missed
workout, with each slice of
cheesecake, another shred of
integrity is lost. This chips
away at our own sense of



==================================================
                     PAGE 468                     
==================================================

self, creating a growing sense
of unreliability. The end
result? For traders, it’s being
scared to take a trade because
you don’t know if you can
trust yourself to follow your
plan once you are in it. And
not trusting yourself as a
trader is a guaranteed route
to disaster.
How do you build up this
sense of self, this sense of
trust in yourself? It’s very



==================================================
                     PAGE 469                     
==================================================

simple: keep your word with
others and yourself, starting
today. More important, learn
to say no so that you don’t
overcommit. But when you
agree to do something,
whether it’s meeting
someone for a drink or going
to the gym at a certain time,
then fight like hell to make it
happen. Be unreasonable if
you have to—after all, you
are building up your most
important trading tool, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 470                     
==================================================

that is faith in yourself that
you will follow your trading
plan, which is following your
word.
There’s no one else there
to hold you to it. You have to
rely on yourself, and you
have to know with absolute
conviction that you are
someone who can be counted
on.
As traders, we are
confronted each moment



==================================================
                     PAGE 471                     
==================================================

with opportunities to violate
our plans. Every new bar or
candlestick is a chance to let
just one of our rules slip.
Whether the outcome is a
win or a loss, toying with
your rules in the heat of the
moment is more than merely
a bad idea; it’s a message to
yourself that you aren’t
reliable, that you don’t play
with integrity. Eventually
your integrity with yourself
erodes to the point where you



==================================================
                     PAGE 472                     
==================================================

don’t even trust yourself.
“Man, I hope I don’t screw
this up again,” Joe Trader
thinks.
Integrity in trading is the
most critical component of
your trading plan. Building
up that integrity is easy to do.
Start with the next trade.
Follow your plan and follow
your word, and your trading
skills will increase.
Where Are You Now in

                     PAGE 473                     
==================================================

Your Trading Journey?
It is critical that traders
understand this process and
recognize where they are on
their journey. This is
obviously important for a
trader’s own development,
but there is a more subtle
reason why it’s essential to
grasp this concept—so that a
trader can understand what
mistakes other traders are
making and how to profit



==================================================
                     PAGE 474                     
==================================================

from those mistakes. This is
the biggest poker game on
the planet, and the money
that’s flowing into your
account isn’t appearing as if
by magic. It’s coming from
someone who is still learning
how the markets work, and
who most likely followed her
gut and got suckered into
taking the wrong side of the
trade.
Believe it or not, everyone

                     PAGE 475                     
==================================================

who is trading today has
about the same odds of
making money on his very
next trade. There is simply
not a lot of skill involved in
making money on one trade.
The difference is over the
course of 60 trades, 100
trades, or 1,000 trades …
who is going to be able to
generate an uptrending
equity curve over the course
of that many trades? It’s the
traders who have graduated



==================================================
                     PAGE 476                     
==================================================

from the four basic phases of
trading:
• Phase I: Destined to lose
—six months to a year
• Phase II: Fear-based
trading—two to six
months
• Phase III: Search for the
Holy Grail—six months
to death
• Phase IV: Learning how
not to lose



==================================================
                     PAGE 477                     
==================================================

I’ve found that most
traders go through these
phases in one fashion or
another. Unfortunately, by
the time they get through
Phase III, they are typically
out of money and can’t even
move on to—or grasp—
learning how not to lose.
Phase V, of course,
represents the time when a
trader has become
consistently profitable. This



==================================================
                     PAGE 478                     
==================================================

doesn’t mean on every trade
—it means creating an equity
curve that has an overall
upward slope. It means
having the ability to be strict
enough in your discipline to
be able to make a consistent
income from the markets.
This means trusting yourself
that you won’t break down
and screw it up yet again.
Remember, the moment a
trader wavers from her plan,
the market is ready to attack.



==================================================
                     PAGE 479                     
==================================================

It’s waiting ever so patiently,
ready to suckle those
emotions, ready to lure
traders back into their old
habits … just one more time!
And the trade might even
work. If it does, it doesn’t
matter. That’s not the point.
If you break your rules once
and win, you’ll break them
again. At some point, this
will come back to haunt both
you and your trading
account. This discipline and

every trade, period. Are you

ENJAMIN RANKLIN
It has been said that the road
to hell is paved with good
intentions, and nowhere is
this more apparent than in
the world of trading. (It also
becomes very apparent when
you start hiring relatives to
help you with your business,
but that story is for another
book.) I have yet to meet one
individual who went into



==================================================
                     PAGE 482                     
==================================================

trading with the goal of
losing money. Everybody’s
intentions are quite the
opposite, and the first thing
people do when they enter
the world of trading is tap
into what has worked for
them successfully in the past.
The problem is that the
tactics that an individual uses
to achieve his goals in
everyday life do not work in
trading; in fact, they are one
of the main reasons for



==================================================
                     PAGE 483                     
==================================================

failure. While good judgment
is critical for an individual
who wants to climb the
corporate ladder or start a
business, we have already
seen why “good judgment”
didn’t work in the middle of
the TASR trade. This leads
us to what has to be the most
painful lesson ever inflicted
on the optimistic nature of
the human species: the
tactics that an individual
uses to achieve her dreams



==================================================
                     PAGE 484                     
==================================================

and goals in everyday life do
not work in trading; in fact,
they are one of the main
reasons for a trader’s
failure. The determination,
courage, positive thinking,
and resoluteness that have
made people a success in one
area of their life simply set
them up for slaughter in the
markets. It is these types of
traders who obstinately hold
on to a losing position,
adding to it on the way



==================================================
                     PAGE 485                     
==================================================

down, using positive thinking
techniques to visualize this
fiasco eventually turning into
a winning trade. I don’t care
how many Tony Robbins
tapes the employees of Enron
listen to; it’s not going to get
their stock back up to $90 a
share. The trader who is
unaware of this phenomenon
is set up for failure from the
very beginning. This doesn’t
mean that a person shouldn’t
be positive about her ability



==================================================
                     PAGE 486                     
==================================================

to eventually become a
successful trader. Far from it.
However, a trader will be
much better off assuming
that every trade she takes is
going to fail. This way, she
learns to focus on protecting
her downside and
minimizing her risk. The
upside can take care of itself,
thank you very much. It’s the
downside that can easily get
out of hand. Be positive on
life, but pessimistic on your



==================================================
                     PAGE 487                     
==================================================

next trade.
Traders who “play the
markets” with a mental
framework oriented toward
how external society rewards
and punishes “good” and
“bad” behavior are set up to
lose from day one. For
example, “cutting one’s
losses short” is difficult when
there is the possibility of the
market’s coming back to the
breakeven point. At



==================================================
                     PAGE 488                     
==================================================

breakeven, the trader is not a
“loser.” Thus, according to
the benchmarks of society, if
traders can exit a position
with a gain, they are
“successful.” This leads to
the removal of stops “once in
a while” in the hopes of
getting out at breakeven—in
order to be a winner in the
eyes of society (sigh). This
can work 10 times in a row,
even 100 times in a row, but
it is the one time when it



==================================================
                     PAGE 489                     
==================================================

doesn’t work that knocks
traders flat on their back. On
this particular day, these
traders will be among the
many who cause a “riplike
movement” in the markets as
they pound their keys in
disgust to get out of a trade
that is killing their account.
This habit of removing stops,
even if it is done only once in
a while, is reinforced by the
societal belief of what
defines a winner versus a



==================================================
                     PAGE 490                     
==================================================

loser. This habit will destroy
a trader’s account faster than
anything else—and the
smaller the account, the more
quickly it will be destroyed.
By using hard stops and
sticking to them, a smaller
trader at least has a fighting
chance of being able to do
this for a living. If he can’t at
least do that, he will not
make it as a trader. Period.
What happens to traders



==================================================
                     PAGE 491                     
==================================================

in the beginning is that they
naturally end up on a cycle in
which they label themselves
as good traders on days when
they make money and as bad
traders on days when they
lose money. This is an
ordinary reaction instilled
into them based on the
principles that apply to
general society. After all,
straight As mean that a
student is a success, while Fs
mean that he is a failure,



==================================================
                     PAGE 492                     
==================================================

right? If there is anything I
can emphasize in this book, it
would be this: trading has
nothing to do with general
society. In fact, the markets
are set up in such a way as to
use what most people hold
near and dear to their hearts
as a means of taking
advantage of them. The
markets thrive on taking the
rules and ideals that govern
general society, wadding
them up into a ball, setting



==================================================
                     PAGE 493                     
==================================================

them on fire, and then
shoving them down a new
trader’s throat. Any trader
who is unaware of this
phenomenon is being played
like a fish right from the
opening bell.
General society tells us
that losing money equates
with failure and making
money equates with success.
After a losing day, the trader
unconsciously thinks, “I’ve



==================================================
                     PAGE 494                     
==================================================

lost money. I can’t do this. If
I had just removed my stop,
the market would have come
back and got me out at
breakeven, and then I’d still
be a contender.” So what
happens is that the trader
starts looking for
opportunities to remove her
stops in order to not end up
with a losing trade. Not on
every trade, of course. Just
on some trades. And how do
traders determine when to do



==================================================
                     PAGE 495                     
==================================================

this? It’s easy enough; they
just use their “judgment”
while they’re in a trade. And
this is exactly when
professional traders step in
for the kill.
This society focus on
money traps traders into the
very habits that cause their
ruination. Removing a stop
in the hopes of getting out at
breakeven is one of the worst
habits a trader can develop.



==================================================
                     PAGE 496                     
==================================================

Sure, it will work some of
the time, but it has to turn
into a disaster only once to
wipe out half or more of an
account. While the rest of the
world views losing as a bad
thing, in trading, small losses
are the best sign of success.
Nobody outside of trading
will ever understand this, so
don’t waste a lot of time
telling your in-laws how
losing only $2,000 yesterday
is part of your success plan.



==================================================
                     PAGE 497                     
==================================================

Yes, this means you are
doing your job, but as long as
the sun continues to rise in
the east, other people will
never get it. The only people
who understand traders are
other traders. Personally,
when I’m at a cocktail party
and people ask me what I do
for a living, I’ve found it’s
easier to say that I do charity
work. People at least
understand that and can
empathize.



==================================================
                     PAGE 498                     
==================================================

The biggest issue for
newer traders is to reprogram
their brains into realizing that
in trading, losing is winning.
A professional trader’s job is
to take small losses. Period.
Most traders don’t realize
that there are only a few days
each month where big profits
can be made. The rest of the
time, traders are doing their
job if they are keeping their
heads above water. The idea
is to keep the trading account



==================================================
                     PAGE 499                     
==================================================

intact for when the big
moves come along. If on
Monday some traders take
three small losses in a row
and end up down on the day,
they are doing their job and
have the chance to be
successful professional
traders, because they will
have maintained the bulk of
their account to use on one of
the few days when the
markets really move. That is
what trading is about. It’s



==================================================
                     PAGE 500                     
==================================================

about traders sticking to the
parameters that they have set
for themselves and sticking
to the setups that they’ve
decided to follow. It’s not
about gut reactions and
chasing the latest sound bite
mentioned on CNBC. That is
the path to trading
annihilation.
I remember getting a call
in mid-2003 from a guy who
was running a $10 million



==================================================
                     PAGE 501                     
==================================================

hedge fund for his family. It
was never made clear to me
how he qualified for this role,
although I think he
mentioned something about
knowing how to use the
Internet. He sent me an e-
mail about YHOO, asking
me for my thoughts. I looked
at the chart. The stock was
trending higher on nice
volume, and I told him about
a couple of different setups I
would use to get long the



==================================================
                     PAGE 502                     
==================================================

stock. Apparently that wasn’t
the answer he was looking
for, because he called me the
next day and told me that I
was reading the chart wrong.
As I listened to him rant on
about page views and
price/earnings (P/E) ratios, a
light went on. I interrupted
him and asked, “Where did
you short this stock?” After a
moment of silence followed
by a cough, the story
emerged. He had shorted it at



==================================================
                     PAGE 503                     
==================================================

$12.00 based on a newsletter
recommendation. As the
stock rallied, the newsletter
had shorted more, and so did
he. By the time I talked to
him, he had shorted 400,000
shares at an average price of
$16.25, for a total outlay of
$6.5 million.
I asked if the newsletter
was still short, and he said
no. I checked my quote
screen and saw that YHOO



==================================================
                     PAGE 504                     
==================================================

was trading at $22.50 and
had just cracked out new 52-
week highs. He asked me if
he should short some more to
raise his average cost, “so it
won’t have to go down as
much for me to get back to
breakeven.”
Here he was down $2.5
million on the trade, his
family hadn’t seen the
statements, and he was trying
to salvage his career as the



==================================================
                     PAGE 505                     
==================================================

family financial guru. There
was zero rationality in his
thinking. I told him he
needed to get out of the
trade, or at least buy call
options for a hedge. I even
said that YHOO was going to
keep on rallying until all the
people who were short cried
uncle and covered.
Apparently that wasn’t the
advice he was looking for,
either. He ended up shorting
another 100,000 shares. He



==================================================
                     PAGE 506                     
==================================================

finally caved when YHOO
hit $30, for a loss of $6.25
million. It’s an excruciating
story, but this happens all the
time with all types of
different account sizes. This
guy didn’t want to take a
small loss because he didn’t
want to look like a loser to
his family. His motto
became, “As long as I hold
on to this position, it’s not
really a loss.” This is like
having blood pour out of



==================================================
                     PAGE 507                     
==================================================

your bowels and choosing
not to go to the doctor. “As
long as I don’t go to the
doctor, no one will know I’m
dying.” Trust me, once you
are dead, people will figure it
out.
Averaging down on a
losing position is like a
sinking ship taking on more
water. When the family fund
manager kept shorting
YHOO as it made new highs,



==================================================
                     PAGE 508                     
==================================================

he might as well have been
driving nails into the Mona
Lisa. Both are deliberate acts
of destruction. Financial
planners always talk about
dollar cost averaging. I call
it dollar loss averaging.
Adding to a winning trade is
okay, but adding to a losing
trade is insane (unless scaling
into a full-sized position is
part of your trading plan). If
you caught some of your
employees stealing from you,



==================================================
                     PAGE 509                     
==================================================

would you give them a raise
or fire them and find
somebody else? This guy
trading YHOO would have
given them a raise, a housing
allowance, and a comfortable
pension.
As traders approach the
end of Phase I, assuming that
they still have any capital
left, they have some solid
experience under their belt.
However, they haven’t quite



==================================================
                     PAGE 510                     
==================================================

figured out why they are
getting hammered by the
markets. It’s not as if they
have lost money on every
trade. In fact, they’ve had
some great trades.
Unfortunately, they’ve also
been knocked down pretty
hard on a number of
occasions, and their account
is under water. They started
off optimistically, but now
they just want to be a little
more careful. And the bottom



==================================================
                     PAGE 511                     
==================================================

line is that they don’t want to
lose any more money.
Welcome to Phase II.
Phase II Trading: Fear-
Based Trading, or, “Why
Does Everything I Touch
Turn to Crap?”
Many traders think that once
they become more cautious,
their trading will improve.
They’re wrong.
When traders decide that



==================================================
                     PAGE 512                     
==================================================

they don’t want to lose any
more money, they
unwittingly turn themselves
into the “late entry”
champions of the trading
world. They wait and they
wait and they make doubly
sure that a trade looks good
before they take it. In this
scenario, the markets start to
rally, but by the time the
trader is absolutely
convinced that this rally is
for real, she is jumping in



==================================================
                     PAGE 513                     
==================================================

near the dead highs of the
move. She and the rest of the
traders who did this just gave
the markets the fuel they
needed to start moving down.
Why? Because suddenly the
market has a lot of stops
being placed beneath it, and
like wind on a forest fire,
these stops will ignite a sell-
off. This safe, cautious entry
quickly turns into a loss. The
difference this time is that
prudent traders religiously



==================================================
                     PAGE 514                     
==================================================

stick to their stops. The
problem is that this
overcautious behavior gives
them terrible entries, and
their odds of getting stopped
out are extremely high. Yes,
small losses are good, but if
nearly every trade results in a
small loss, the account will
eventually be worn down.
Phase II usually doesn’t
last very long. Traders in this
phase generally don’t lose a



==================================================
                     PAGE 515                     
==================================================

lot of money, but they lose
enough. Once traders figure
out that they can stick to their
stops, but that their entries
are suffering, they reach
what alcoholics refer to as a
“moment of clarity.” If their
entries are bad, then
obviously their indicators are
bad. So they go looking for
some better ones. And thus
begins the search for the
Holy Grail.

==================================================

Phase III Trading: Why Is
the Search for the Holy
Grail Guaranteed to Limit
Your Success as a Trader
and an Investor?
The search for that fail-safe
indicator that’s going to work
nearly every time takes a
trader down a path that’s
littered with corpses, broken
dreams, and stuttering fools.
Many traders stay in this
search for the rest of their

lives. The irony is that
individuals in this phase
think they are developing as
traders, when in reality their
development as traders is
dead in the water, having
been stopped faster and with
greater intensity than Monica
Lewinsky’s future in
government. Traders in
Phase III are stuck in
quicksand, entrenched in a
losing game that can last
years, decades, or longer.



==================================================
                     PAGE 518                     
==================================================

The end result is a trader who
spends this time repeating the
same mistakes over and over
again or happily discovering
new ones.
The cycle that takes place
is one of always looking for
the next best thing. It’s the
search for that oh-so-special
indicator or system that is
going to give the traders their
lodestone reward. In a typical
scenario, this means diving



==================================================
                     PAGE 519                     
==================================================

headlong into a couple of
different trading programs or
ideas and tweaking them
endlessly until they reveal
their magic. One typical
scenario involves traders
who develop a simple set of
mechanical rules, which are
kept secret, of course, that
will help them attain a
substantial profit each year
with virtually no risk and
using only a small amount of
capital. They get especially



==================================================
                     PAGE 520                     
==================================================

excited when they see that
these methods, when
carefully applied to selected
historical data, work
amazingly well. The ones
that didn’t work out could
easily have been “filtered
out.” This type of trader
typically dies with a one-
page summary of how well
the trade works and a stack
of 68 pages that explain
when not to take the trade.



==================================================
                     PAGE 521                     
==================================================

Other traders who are
stuck in Phase III will go to
seminars and learn about
trends, and learn the
importance of never fighting
the trend. They discover the
magic of moving averages
and how they cross over
when the trend changes. Oh,
the power! When the market
is trending, these methods
work beautifully. Eventually,
though, these traders get
discouraged when they figure



==================================================
                     PAGE 522                     
==================================================

out that 75 percent of the
time, markets are trading
sideways, as professionals
chop the Holy Grail seekers
into mincemeat.
This may lead traders to
the world of options, where
they start looking at spreads
to contain risk and writing
premiums to generate
monthly income. This works
great when the markets are
chopping around, but then



==================================================
                     PAGE 523                     
==================================================

when the markets start
trending again, these
positions can, and often do,
get killed.
The list goes on and on.
At various stages throughout
this journey, after traders
have studied a number of
systems, strategies, and
indicators, one day they sit
down and create what they
think is the perfect chart with
the perfect indicators. Then



==================================================
                     PAGE 524                     
==================================================

they start to use it. It may
work well for the first couple
of days, or even the first
couple of weeks, but then the
traders get burned on what
they thought was a perfect
setup. So, instead of using an
MACD (moving average
convergence divergence)
with a setting of 12, 26, 9,
they read somewhere that a
setting of 12, 17, 10 is faster.
They go in and reformat all
their charts with the new



==================================================
                     PAGE 525                     
==================================================

setting and eagerly await the
next trading day. Their
setups work for a couple of
days or a couple of weeks,
and then a couple of trade
setups don’t work out. Back
into cyberspace the traders
go. They are determined.
They are focused. They
neglect their family, miss
their daughter’s softball
game, and lose track of time.
But it’s all worth it, because
seven days later, at 3:45 in



==================================================
                     PAGE 526                     
==================================================

the morning, they discover
what they’ve been looking
for. On their stochastic,
they’ve been using the
settings 14, 3, 3 when they
should have been using 15, 3,
1! They put it on a chart and
apply it to historical data. It
works much better! The
traders once again reformat
all their charts and, once
again, eagerly await the next
trading day.



==================================================
                     PAGE 527                     
==================================================

And when this doesn’t
work, they go from a 15-
minute chart to a 13-minute
chart. And when that doesn’t
work, they switch from
trading the E-mini S&P to
trading the E-mini Nasdaq.
And when that doesn’t work,
they learn that the euro is the
place to be. And when that
doesn’t work, they become
gold bugs, because, don’t
you know, it’s the only real
money? It’s always, always,



==================================================
                     PAGE 528                     
==================================================

always the next best thing.
This cycle repeats itself
forever until the trader gets
sick of this roller coaster and
jumps off at the next stop.
Most never figure this out
and remain stuck here for the
rest of their trading lives.
Their kids go from diapers to
dormitories, and they barely
notice because they’re still
lost, tweaking the next best
thing, never realizing that
they’re the chump with the

                     PAGE 529                     
==================================================

strategy who would be
welcomed with open arms in
any casino. Like Duluth,
Minnesota, in February, it’s a
terrible place to be.
This whole situation is
summed up succinctly by one
of the hedge fund characters
in Ben Mezrich’s
entertaining book Ugly
Americans: The True Story of
the Ivy League Cowboys Who
Raided the Asian Markets for

of arbitrage is spotting who
the asshole is. If you can’t
spot the asshole—well, then
you’re the asshole.”
What Are the Signs That a
Trader Is Stuck in Phase I,
II, or III?
Here are a few additional
anecdotes and situations that
let traders know that they are
still stuck in these beginning



==================================================
                     PAGE 531                     
==================================================

stages of trading.
Good Till Close
A popular order type for
swing traders is called a GTC
order, or “good till
canceled.” This means just
what it says: “Keep my order
in place until my target is hit
or until I cancel the order.”
My partners and I, as well as
many brokers, refer to GTC
orders as “good till close.”



==================================================
                     PAGE 532                     
==================================================

This is because many traders
will keep their “good till
canceled” order in place right
up until price action gets
“close” to their order. What
happens is that the stock they
are in is rallying hard and
approaching their GTC sell
order. They start looking at
the stock and think, “Wow,
this stock is acting great! I
don’t want to get out of it
because it’s going to keep
heading higher.” So they call



==================================================
                     PAGE 533                     
==================================================

their broker and cancel their
GTC sell order. The stock
rallies, pushes up through
that order level, and then
eventually starts to sell off.
The trader has no exit
strategy, and the stock
continues to fall and turns
into a losing trade. This starts
off as a greed play and turns
into a fear play. When this
happens to traders often
enough, they start to get
really fearful about losing

==================================================

money.
Size Really Does Matter
When traders get scared and
start to put most of their
focus on not being wrong, a
variety of bad things start to
happen. The most common is
that the traders get into a new
position, and as soon as they
see a small profit, they take
it. They buy the minisized
Dow at 10,100, and it goes to



==================================================
                     PAGE 535                     
==================================================

10,104. Even though there
are screaming buy signals in
place and there are zero sell
signals, they, miracle of
miracles, have a profit, and
they’ll be damned if they are
going to let the market take it
away from them. So they
pocket the four Dow points,
which amount to $20 per
contract, or about $14.00
after commissions. Never
mind that the Dow goes on to
rally another 40 points before



==================================================
                     PAGE 536                     
==================================================

it gives an exit signal.
What happens is that these
traders are taking a four-
point profit, a three-point
profit, and a six-point profit,
and then the last trade of the
day goes 30 points against
them. So the traders have
three winners out of four, but
they are down on the day.
And this is kind of a typical
thing that’ll happen to traders
who are in this frame of mind



==================================================
                     PAGE 537                     
==================================================

of not wanting to have to go
through the pain of watching
a profitable position go all
the way back into the red.
Many brokers actually
analyze their clients’
accounts in order to predict
when they are going to blow
up. This way they can hedge
the traders before the losses
actually occur, essentially
trading against their clients.
The number one indicator



==================================================
                     PAGE 538                     
==================================================

that a trading account is
going to blow up is an
increase in the frequency of
trading combined with an
increased use of market
orders instead of limit orders.
Firms that hedge see this
situation develop, begin to
lick their chops, and fade
their customer’s account,
taking the opposite side of
every trade. In general,
traders who suddenly start
taking smaller profits are also



==================================================
                     PAGE 539                     
==================================================

trading much more
frequently than they used to.
It is important to realize that
some firms will see this
activity and take specific
action, because 90 percent of
the time this means that a
trader is about to blow up his
account. Don’t be the trader
who comes up on the
broker’s radar screen as a
hedging candidate.
Yes, size does matter.



==================================================
                     PAGE 540                     
==================================================

Bigger losses are a lot worse
than smaller profits.
However, a trader who takes
small profits because of fear
is not following a plan. A
trader who is not following a
plan, who is reacting only to
internal emotions, is going to
get beaten. Not maybe. Not
probably. Going to.
Greed Is Bad Nourishment
for the Brain



==================================================
                     PAGE 541                     
==================================================

There are limitless ways in
which traders can sabotage
their accounts, but this is a
particularly good one. What
happens is that traders get
into a comfortable routine.
Maybe they are averaging
$250 a day trading the mini-
sized Dow on a $50,000
account. This, for them, is a
reasonable goal with the
capital they are trading. One
night such a trader is at
dinner with his spouse, who



==================================================
                     PAGE 542                     
==================================================

asks how the trading is
going. The trader responds
that all is going great. The
spouse is pleased and says
something like, “Well, since
your trading is going so well,
I’ve been thinking that I’d
really like to get a BMW.
Can we go ahead and get
one?”
And so the next day, the
trader wakes up and think,
“Okay, if I’m going to get



==================================================
                     PAGE 543                     
==================================================

this BMW, I’ve got to step
up my trading and start
making $750 a day. This way
I can set aside a large down
payment, and I can get the
car in the next six to eight
weeks.” The very second a
trader utters those words, a
trigger clicks in the remote
recesses of his mind, and he
has unknowingly entered a
period in which he will not
be able to do anything right.
Instead of sticking to his



==================================================
                     PAGE 544                     
==================================================

original parameters, he is
going to start reaching for
more. What used to look like
a perfectly good 20-point
profit in the mini-sized Dow
now looks puny—it certainly
won’t have much of an
impact on the BMW
purchase. So the position
doesn’t get sold, and the
trader sits back and waits for
the market to give him more
money. The market
inevitably turns, and the



==================================================
                     PAGE 545                     
==================================================

trader ends up getting
stopped out for a loss. In this
mindset, what once used to
look like a reasonable profit
becomes too small, and this
throws the entire trading plan
out the window.
I remember working with
one trader who was in almost
exactly this situation. He was
a good trader, but he had
recently entered a losing
streak, and he couldn’t figure



==================================================
                     PAGE 546                     
==================================================

out why. I asked him if he
suddenly was trying to trade
his way into any big, specific
purchases. Yes. Aha.
Something for his wife. We
talked about this
phenomenon for a while,
including the story about the
fur coat, which is described
in Reminiscences of a Stock
Operator, by Edwin Lefevre,
a book that is a must read for
all traders. My friend paused
for a moment and rubbed his



==================================================
                     PAGE 547                     
==================================================

chin. “Well, I think I know
how to fix this problem,” he
said. “I’ll just divorce my
wife.”
This is the home run
mentality, and it’s a pitfall
for all traders. It’s important
for the trader to remember
that the market is not going
anywhere. Like an all-you-
can-eat buffet in Vegas, it’s
going to be there all the time.
There is no reason to try to



==================================================
                     PAGE 548                     
==================================================

load up your plate to the max
on your first trip through the
buffet line. You can grab
your plate, mosey on over to
the buffet, pick up a couple
of pieces of shrimp, and
saunter back over to your
table and enjoy them. Then,
when that’s done, you can go
back and pick out a few
slices of brie. There is no
need to be a hog and load up
your plate. The buffet is
always going to be there. A

                     PAGE 549                     
==================================================

person can sit there all day
and take little nibbles from
the buffet all day long.
Remember, in the markets,
bulls can win and bears can
win, but pigs get slaughtered.
Speaking of Jesse Livermore
Many traders know that
Reminiscences of a Stock
Operator, by Edwin Lefevre,
is a book about Jesse
Livermore, the famed trader



==================================================
                     PAGE 550                     
==================================================

who made approximately
$100 million in 1929 dollars
in the stock market crash
(about a billion in today’s
dollars). What many people
do not know is that on March
5, 1934, he filed for
bankruptcy, and on
November 28, 1940, he blew
his brains out in the
bathroom stall of a hotel.
Although this may not sound
like a strong endorsement for
the book, it is a must read for



==================================================
                     PAGE 551                     
==================================================

any serious trader. While this
book talks about the trading
strategies that made him his
fortune, the book Jesse
Livermore, World’s Greatest
Stock Trader, by Richard
Smitten, also goes into detail
about the years and days
leading up to his suicide.
I majored in history, and I
was trained to take pieces of
historical data and form an
opinion, based on facts,



==================================================
                     PAGE 552                     
==================================================

about what really happened
in the past. From what I’ve
read about Jesse Livermore’s
life and eventual demise, my
opinion is that he suffered a
bout of euphoria after the
1929 crash. This euphoria
caused him to trade
recklessly and with huge
size, and this caused him to
lose his fortune in less than
five years. Although he had
gone broke and made a
fortune three times before,



==================================================
                     PAGE 553                     
==================================================

the size of this loss did
permanent psychological
damage, and the pressing
weight of “trying to make it
all back” is what eventually
did him in. Let’s take a look
at what euphoria can do to a
trader.
Euphoria: Redefining Stupid
Euphoria is the worst
emotion for a trader to
succumb to, even worse than



==================================================
                     PAGE 554                     
==================================================

greed. What happens with
euphoria is that traders have
such a great day in the
markets that they proclaim
themselves king of the
trading world. Let’s say they
normally trade 10 contracts.
Well, now, since they are
“king,” they are going to start
off with 50 contracts, and go
up from there if they feel like
it. After all, they are now
“the world’s greatest trader”
and can do no wrong.



==================================================
                     PAGE 555                     
==================================================

This happens to traders
frequently, and the resulting
act of insanity is just like
doubling each bet on a
roulette wheel. People can sit
on red and keep doubling up
on each bet until they win.
This works great right up
until the time that they have
maxed out their capital on
red, and the color comes up
black. Doubling and tripling
up on positions just because
a trader is feeling confident



==================================================
                     PAGE 556                     
==================================================

is yet another sucker’s game.
What’s worse is that this
strategy always leads to
traders giving back all the
fantastic gains that made
them euphoric in the first
place. This places added
pressure on them—now they
have to trade in order to get
back to where they were.
This, of course, causes a
multitude of bad habits.
Increasing trading size



==================================================
                     PAGE 557                     
==================================================

just because you are feeling
awesome about your trading
is like being in a marriage
that is going fantastically
well. The conversations are
sparkling, the mutual
adulation is adoring, and life
under the covers is grand.
Happiness abounds in
spades. How can you make
this better? Double up! Have
an affair. It may seem like a
good idea in theory, but this
is going to turn out only one

way—very, very badly.
Paper Trading—Why Is It
More Worthless Than an
Iraqi Dinar?
When I wrote the title of this
section in 2005, I never
imagined that there would be
a growing popularity of
advertisements from firms
pushing paper Iraqi dinars as
an investment. Admittedly,
the ads sound very appealing.



==================================================
                     PAGE 559                     
==================================================

For just a few thousand
dollars, you can buy a
million dollars worth of
dinars, and “when the dinar
goes to parity with the U.S.
dollar,” it will then be worth
a million U.S. dollars. And of
course the firm that is selling
these dinars is also the only
place where a market is
being made. Never mind that
this exchange rate is a hoax
and that the black market for
dollars in Iraq is many



==================================================
                     PAGE 560                     
==================================================

multiples of what is being
shown in the advertisements
(that is, the Iraqi dinar is
even more worthless than
advertised because people
prefer having U.S. dollars).
Hopefully I’m not the first
person to give the heads up
that this is one of those
scenarios where “if it sounds
too good to be true, then pull
your head out of the sand,
because it is too good to be
true.” Yes, at some point the



==================================================
                     PAGE 561                     
==================================================

dinar may be pegged to the
U.S. dollar, but that is not
even in the ballpark of going
“to parity” with the U.S.
dollar. And if it does go to
parity with the U.S. dollar,
guess how that will happen?
It will be revalued. Iraqi
dinars can be printed at will.
That does not constitute
rarity and value. The few
thousand dollars you are
tempted to throw at this in
the hopes of turning it into



==================================================
                     PAGE 562                     
==================================================

millions would be better
served by putting them
toward a vacation or
something tangible like
silver. And even if you want
to sell it, who is going to buy
it? There is no market for it.
Ah, but there is! Go on eBay
and sell it to someone who
thinks it’s going to parity
with the U.S. dollar. But
hurry before the jig is up. If
you have any doubts, then
think of it this way—if this



==================================================
                     PAGE 563                     
==================================================

were a legitimate
opportunity, then George
Soros would already have
cornered this market. He
knows a little more about
currencies than you and I do.
This reminds me of the
“ostrich scam” that hit Texas
a decade or so ago. Breeder
ostriches were going for
$50,000 each because of the
high nutritional value of the
meat. Unfortunately, no one



==================================================
                     PAGE 564                     
==================================================

bought the meat, so the
breeders just kept selling
their stock to other people
who wanted to breed
ostriches, and so on, until
everyone who wanted to
breed ostriches had them.
After that, you literally
couldn’t give the large birds
away, and to this day there
are some of them roaming
free on the Texas plains.
Which brings us back to
paper trading.

                     PAGE 565                     
==================================================

There are a few good
reasons for people to paper
trade. Paper trading will help
a trader learn a new
execution platform. This
way, she can figure out how
to use the software through a
demo account and save
herself the costly errors that
can arise when people they
try to place orders on an
unfamiliar system. Also,
paper trading is good for
forward-testing a system or

strategy to see how it works
before committing real
money. However, paper
trading does have one
distinct disadvantage—it can
be worthless in a way
because it does not take into
account how a trader will act
when there is real money on
the line. That is what makes
or breaks a trader. It’s okay
to trade smaller size, but
without real money on the
line, a trader won’t

==================================================

understand how she holds up
under pressure. This is also a
good way for a trader to test
how far apart she is mentally
from “paper trading vs. real
trading.” A trader should feel
the same, or at least as close
as possible, when trading
paper as she does when she is
trading with real money. To
the extent that she feels
extreme emotions when she
is really trading rather than
paper trading, it will give her



==================================================
                     PAGE 568                     
==================================================

a clue as to where she is on
the psychological trading
scale. In other words, how
screwed up is she
psychologically when she is
actually trading with real
money? When a trader freaks
out on a real trade, it is a red
flag that she is trading too
big for her account size. Her
judgment goes to zero, and
financial ruin is just around
the corner. In this case, a
trader should keep trading



==================================================
                     PAGE 569                     
==================================================

smaller size until she feels
the same emotionally as
when she is in a paper trade.
Building up trading size is
very similar to building up
muscle with weights. The
first time a person goes into
the gym, he may only be able
to bench-press 140 pounds
for 10 repetitions. A month
later, he is able to push 140
pounds 15 times, at which
point he ups the weight to



==================================================
                     PAGE 570                     
==================================================

150 pounds for 10 reps. This
continues over the course of
a few years, at the end of
which he is cranking out 200
pounds for 10 repetitions.
Yet had he tried benching
200 pounds at the outset, he
could literally have killed
himself. It’s the same in
trading. The first time I lost
$1,000, I threw up. The next
time, I merely choked on my
own bile. By the tenth time,
it became something that my



==================================================
                     PAGE 571                     
==================================================

intestines could handle. At
that point, I realized it was
time to up my trade size to
where I could risk $1,500 on
a trade without getting “too
intense” emotionally. And as
the years went by, I was able
to increase that to larger and
larger amounts as mentally
and emotionally I got used to
the dollar swings on my
scoreboard. And it has to be
treated as such—a
scoreboard. The moment you



==================================================
                     PAGE 572                     
==================================================

start thinking in terms of
purchasing power, of
something that you could buy
with your winnings or could
have bought with the current
losing trade, all is lost.
Emotions at that point rule
the day, and that strategy
only works to the trader’s
detriment. One thing I’ve
studied over the years, and
we’ve come out with
irrefutable proof— staring
harder at the screen does not

                     PAGE 573                     
==================================================

make the market do what you
want it to do. If you find
yourself staring intently at
the screen, it’s a heads-up
that you are trading too big
for your account size.
The most dramatic
instance I’ve seen of this is in
working with traders in Asia,
specifically in Taipei, Hong
Kong, Tokyo, and Shanghai.
Asians are fantastic
gamblers, willing to risk



==================================================
                     PAGE 574                     
==================================================

huge sums. This can be a
problem with trading, and it
takes only one bad trade to
ruin an account. One guy I
worked with was trading 100
lots at a time in a $100,000
account (obviously using the
maximum day-trading
margin). Each 1-point move
in the S&Ps represented
$5,000. The first day he
made 5 points ($25,000), and
the next day he lost 7 points
($35,000). These were



==================================================
                     PAGE 575                     
==================================================

normal fluctuations for him,
and it showed. He’d get so
excited and animated that I
thought he was going to
implode. I had him cut his
size down to 10 lots. At first
he was bored, but then a
strange thing happened. He
wasn’t excited, so he traded
objectively … and he made
money. We got him to trade
in the same mental state he
was in when he was paper
trading, and it made all the



==================================================
                     PAGE 576                     
==================================================

difference. Being able to
work with traders overseas is
a great win/win for me, as I
get to learn how other people
view the U.S. markets, as
well as see how U.S. news is
filtered through their local
news channels. Being able to
put yourself in another
person’s shoes brings more
understanding of how the
world really works. That may
not help you decide whether
or not to take the next trading

setup that comes your way,
but it does help you form a
macro view of the world—
and it does make life more
interesting.
But What About Phase IV
—How Does a Person
Learn How Not to Lose
Money?
This is the trickiest part for
traders to get their arms
around. Learning how not to



==================================================
                     PAGE 578                     
==================================================

lose? In trading, first you
lose, then you learn how not
to lose, and then, and only
then, can you get on the road
to generating a consistent
income. “Learning how not
to lose” is a simple way of
summing up everything
we’ve talked about up to this
point. It’s about having the
patience to wait, the courage
to get out, and the integrity to
follow your plan—all of that
leads to learning how not to



==================================================
                     PAGE 579                     
==================================================

lose. It’s about focusing on
limiting risk, not having to be
right, and limiting the
downside so that the upside
can take care of itself. And
once this starts to sink in and
you get comfortable with
“learning how not to lose,”
then and only then can you
make the transition to
generating a consistent
income from trading.
Ironically, though we all
think we are different and



==================================================
                     PAGE 580                     
==================================================

unique human beings, people
who lose consistently in the
markets over time all do
exactly the same things.
They (1) overtrade, or trade
way too frequently, (2) use
too tight stops (their fear of
loss is so strong that they
don’t even give the trade a
chance to work out), (3) trade
with too much leverage (they
would be far better off
trading smaller size), or (4)
have one big loss that wipes



==================================================
                     PAGE 581                     
==================================================

out a big chunk of their
account. Losing traders
consistently do at least one—
if not all— of these four
things. I’ve looked at
hundreds of brokerage
accounts, and they all tell the
same story. In fact, I know
traders who fixed their
trading simply by doing the
opposite of this. They (1)
undertrade, or trade one or
two solid setups each day, (2)
use too wide stops, staying



==================================================
                     PAGE 582                     
==================================================

outside of the market noise,
(3) trade with appropriate
leverage, which is why they
are able to use wider stops,
and (4) never have a big
losing trade. It really can be
that simple.
Why Does the Plateau
Money Management
Method Work?
Up to this point, I haven’t
talked about a specific



==================================================
                     PAGE 583                     
==================================================

money management method,
but there is one I’d like to
talk about now. It’s
something I’ve been
surprised to find that not
many traders think much
about. The usual mindset is,
“Get some setups, follow
them, and make some
money.” Yet once a trader
has his psychology in check,
the next issue that has to be
resolved is money
management. There are



==================================================
                     PAGE 584                     
==================================================

innumerable methodologies
and schools of thought where
money management is
concerned. And plenty of
them work, at least up to a
point.
What many money
management systems fail to
acknowledge is that as
traders inch up the ladder of
profitability, they frequently
hit mental plateaus. Maybe a
trader can start with a



==================================================
                     PAGE 585                     
==================================================

$25,000 account and run it
up to $40,000, but then,
instead of climbing still
further and taking the
account to the next level, the
trader plateaus, and things
begin to fall apart. This
$40,000 plateau becomes an
invisible barrier that holds
the trader down and prevents
him from moving to the next
level. Plateaus can easily turn
into very real stumbling
blocks. They can trigger bad



==================================================
                     PAGE 586                     
==================================================

habits, usually based on the
idea that a trader now has a
“comfortable cushion of
cash” to work with in his
account. This makes him lax,
more prone to break his
rules. This amount will be
different for everyone.
Maybe you have a $5,000
account and you do a great
job running it up to $7,500,
but when you reach that, you
hit a big losing streak. Or
maybe you have $75,000,



==================================================
                     PAGE 587                     
==================================================

and every time you hit
$100,000, you start trading
with “house money” and
getting more aggressive, and
soon you find yourself back
at $75,000.
I’ve struggled with this
problem myself over the
course of my trading life,
although my plateaus have
grown over time. It’s almost
like lifting weights. You
have to reach new levels all



==================================================
                     PAGE 588                     
==================================================

the time, not just in terms of
your trading skills, but in
terms of figuring out how to
wrap your mind around
specific amounts of money.
You have to get comfortable
with progressively larger and
larger sums.
I have solved this problem
by employing a particular
strategy that I call “the
plateau method” of managing
my day-trading accounts.



==================================================
                     PAGE 589                     
==================================================

Specifically, this is for
trading shorter-term, highly
leveraged accounts such as
futures, forex, and options. I
don’t use this methodology
for swing and position
trading.
Let’s use a $10,000
hypothetical starting account.
Your initial goal is to run the
account up to 2.5 times your
starting capital, which is
$25,000. (This is an example;



==================================================
                     PAGE 590                     
==================================================

your amount to reach may be
different.) Under this
methodology, when you
reach your desired target
($25,000, in this case), you
withdraw your original
$10,000, plus a profit of
$2,500, leaving you with a
balance of $12,500 in your
trading account.
Now you tweak your goal.
Instead of $25,000, your aim
is to run your account up to



==================================================
                     PAGE 591                     
==================================================

2.5 times your new starting
capital, which equals
$31,250 ($12,500 × 2.5).
Once you reach your
target of $31,250, withdraw
half of the account ($15,625)
and reset your goal.
Now your goal is to take
the $15,625 and increase it
2.5 times yet again, making
your goal $39,062.50. When
you reach that target, take out
half, and continue.



==================================================
                     PAGE 592                     
==================================================

The time it takes to do this
isn’t critical. You aren’t
focused on achieving your
target in a week or a month
or a quarter. You’re simply
following your plan and
taking your setups, and when
you hit the plateau, you’ll
take money out and establish
a new goal. When you’re
trading leveraged
instruments, one solid runner
can make a big impact on
your account. This is why it



==================================================
                     PAGE 593                     
==================================================

is so critical to keep your
losses small.
Here’s the key: you aren’t
trading your whole stake. If
you have $50,000 with which
to trade, then use only
$10,000 as your stake to get
started. This allows you the
freedom to take bigger risks,
because it’s only $10,000 of
your $50,000. And if your
$10,000 gets wiped out, then
you have another $10,000 to



==================================================
                     PAGE 594                     
==================================================

put in and try again until
you’ve got the hang of it.
Naturally, not everyone is
going to have $50,000 in
starting capital. If $5,000 or
$10,000 is all you can
manage, that’s fine. Just be
careful not to piss your
capital away on undeserved
risks, trades that are typically
taken out of boredom. Wait
for the “Porsche setups” and
pass on the “Pinto setups”



==================================================
                     PAGE 595                     
==================================================

that I talk about later, and
establish a trading plan that
insists on only the highest-
probability trades. And now
you know you’ll keep your
word and follow your plan,
because you’re committed to
trading with integrity,
remember?
The plateau method works
because it assumes that you
have passed the first few
phases of the trading journey



==================================================
                     PAGE 596                     
==================================================

and are now content to
simply wait for the best
setups that work with your
plan. As with any trade,
you’ll want to consider the
market within more than one
time frame, always “zooming
out” to see the bigger picture,
which helps you maximize
runners (more on this later).
And remember that there will
be days when nothing is
setting up for you. When
those days come and go,



==================================================
                     PAGE 597                     
==================================================

review your charts at the end
of the session and take a
good, hard look at all the
crappy trades that some poor
bastards stuck in Phase II
took, and then pat yourself
on the back as you think
about all the money they lost
that you held on to (because
you have learned how not to
lose). Some of the best trades
are the ones not taken.
People who overtrade or



==================================================
                     PAGE 598                     
==================================================

trade without money
management plans are
trading an incomplete system
and fall into that category
we’re all so eager to avoid—
the 90 percent of traders who
are going to lose their
accounts to those of us who
have trading plans in place
that include quantifiable and
specific money management
plans.
Trading with small sums



==================================================
                     PAGE 599                     
==================================================

—ideally just a part of your
trading capital, not all of it—
on a limited number of
reliable, proven setups opens
up the opportunity for
extraordinary results. When
you add the plateau method
of managing your gains, you
have the added benefit of
holding on to the capital you
worked so hard to acquire.
When you have a working
methodology to focus on,
you’re not just looking for



==================================================
                     PAGE 600                     
==================================================

the next winning trade.
Though individual trades are
obviously critical, when
viewed through the lens of
your grander plans, each
trade becomes just a brick in
the wall of wealth you are
building. Yes, some of those
bricks will fall off the wall,
but you are building tools to
replace those bricks and
continue building.

Investing, What Are the
Best Ideas to Keep in Mind?
A trader’s relationship with
the market is really like a
dance, and it’s best to let the
market lead. It’s important
not to come into the market
with an overly bullish or
overly bearish outlook. The
more strongly a trader
believes in an idea, the easier
it will be for her to get
suckered into taking the



==================================================
                     PAGE 602                     
==================================================

wrong side of a trade. In an
upcoming chapter, I talk
about how to read market
internals, and this is a great
way to get a reading on
what’s happening in the
markets. Instead of coming
into the day a raging bull or a
roaring bear, I just come in
as an interested observer.
The “radar screen” that I
watch keeps me in the loop
and gives me odds on the
path of least resistance. As



==================================================
                     PAGE 603                     
==================================================

long as we’re dancing
together, I’d like to know
when my partner is going to
try to dip me.
The reality is that the
markets do move in cycles.
My studies in history had a
huge impact here. I could
clearly see that since the
beginning of modern
civilization, the world had
gone through a number of
repetitions of similar events,



==================================================
                     PAGE 604                     
==================================================

all driven by human
decisions. This insight really
changed my focus and how I
looked for opportunities in
the markets. I stopped
looking for the next great
indicator and started looking
for repeatable market
patterns based on human
nature.
A great book that falls
within this theme is The
Secret Life of Real Estate



==================================================
                     PAGE 605                     
==================================================

and Banking, by Phillip J.
Anderson. The dry title does
not do this book justice. It’s a
great and fascinating read,
and the author is incredibly
passionate about his subject
matter. With great stories and
examples, he documents how
a real estate price cycle that
has repeated every 18 years
since the United States was
formed peaked right on
schedule in 2008. More
fascinating is how the actions



==================================================
                     PAGE 606                     
==================================================

of speculators, bankers, and
politicians—all of whom are
reacting to the price
movement of real estate—
were all nearly exactly the
same during each one of
these 22 cycles. In other
words, none of the stuff you
are seeing on TV today is
new. Politicians, banks, and
speculators have been
reliving their lives and
policies right on cue in
predictable, 18-year cycles.

                     PAGE 607                     
==================================================

This knowledge is priceless
when it comes to financial
planning and real estate
investing—not to mention
keeping the latest headlines
in perspective.
And there’s a little saying
that I always like to
remember; it’s called
“discipline before vision,”
which is something I first
heard from Peter Borish, the
former head of research for

                     PAGE 608

Paul Tudor Jones. I may
think that the market is going
to crash today, but I’m still
going to have a stop in place
in case I’m wrong. The
vision of being short during a
crash is a pleasant one, and
the thought of a big move
leads traders to do stupid
things, like doubling up and
adding to losing positions.
Disciplined traders live to
fight another day. Through
most of 2004 and 2005, I



==================================================
                     PAGE 609                     
==================================================

heard many traders who were
“staying positioned for the
next, inevitable terrorist
attack.” After the events of
September 11, they saw how
that had affected the markets,
and they wanted to get
positioned for the next
attack. (Yes, this is a terrible
way to look at a disaster, but
this is how traders think. If
there is a hurricane in
Florida, then it’s time to go
long lumber because they



==================================================
                     PAGE 610                     
==================================================

will have to rebuild a lot of
houses.) The funny thing is,
this vision of being
positioned for a crash totally
clouded their judgment. The
only thing the market hates is
uncertainty. The events of
September 11 were
unexpected, and the market
got crushed. However,
terrorist activity is now a
certainty. It is no longer an
unexpected event, and
therefore the market has



==================================================
                     PAGE 611                     
==================================================

already priced in future
terrorist attacks. Sound
insane? On July 7, 2005,
America woke up to the
news of the London
bombings. At one point, the
Dow was down more than
200 points before the market
open. All of these people got
heavily short. The markets
rallied and closed positive on
the day, and these “waiting
for the next disaster traders”
got crushed. Discipline

                     PAGE 612                     
==================================================

before vision.
This also ties in with one
of the main themes of this
chapter: do you want to be
right, or do you want to make
money? Just think if you had
kept buying the dip on the
day of the flash crash. You
would have been wiped out.
Another reason to rely on
discipline before vision is
that a stock or a market can
move for any reason. It

doesn’t have to be logical or
rational. It could be world
events: war in the Middle
East, a fragile European
economy, or politicians who
refuse to work together. But
it could be something
completely different—
something that Maria
Bartiromo can’t tell you,
can’t predict, and can’t figure
out.
For example, one day

                     PAGE 614                     
==================================================

when I logged into my
trading account to set up
some buy orders, I was told
that my buying power had
been exhausted. I keep solid
mental track of my stock and
option positions, and I knew
that I should have plenty of
buying power. I checked my
records, knowing that I’d be
flat. But what I saw on my
computer was that I’d
depleted my buying power
on 60,000 shares of IAG, a



==================================================
                     PAGE 615                     
==================================================

gold stock. I called to
confirm that and was told
that, yes, I’d made that trade.
But I knew I hadn’t.
Then I got an instant
message from a new
employee named Henry
Gambell. Henry, who’d
recently set up a demo
trading account, told me that
his “demo” account had
come up nicely on 60,000
shares of IAG he’d



==================================================
                     PAGE 616                     
==================================================

purchased.
Really?
I started looking at all
gold stocks. Every one was
down except for IAG, which
was up by 50 cents.
I looked at the markets,
and I couldn’t figure out why
IAG was up. Was there
news? No. So I went back to
a one-minute chart and found
a huge volume spike— right
at the open—in IAG. Henry,



==================================================
                     PAGE 617                     
==================================================

having thought that he had
logged into my demo account
but in fact having actually
logged into my real account,
had purchased 60,000 shares
of IAG at the open, at the
market price. To this day,
I’m convinced that other
black box systems saw this
“volume spike” and started
buying the stock based on
“unusual activity.” Single-
handedly and inadvertently,
Henry, a demoaccount trader



==================================================
                     PAGE 618                     
==================================================

for all of two weeks, had
driven up the price of IAG,
while all other gold stocks
were going down. I brought
Henry into my office and
explained what had
happened. He turned white as
a sheet and got very nervous,
very quickly. I told him he
needed to manage the trade
now and get out of the
position. He started to sell all
60,000 shares at market, but I
stopped him. I explained the



==================================================
                     PAGE 619                     
==================================================

need to scale out of the trade
1,000 shares at a time,
waiting a few minutes in
between sell orders. He did
that for the next hour and
eventually closed out the
entire position for a nice
profit—it covered his salary
for a year.
It was a good lesson for
me—watch those demo
account logins. It was a good
lesson for Henry as well—



==================================================
                     PAGE 620                     
==================================================

market movements are not
rational, so control your risk
on each and every trade.
Toward the end of the
day, he did ask, “So do I get
to keep any of the profits?”
My response? “If it had lost
that much money, would you
have been able to help cover
any of the losses?” We called
it even.
Since market moves can
be irrational, one needs to



==================================================
                     PAGE 621                     
==================================================

focus on limiting one’s risk
on every trade, not obsessing
over why the stock price is
going up or down. It is also
important to remember that
there is no need to spend
wasted years looking for
complicated setups or the
next Holy Grail. There are
very simple setups out there
to use. Some of the best
traders I know have been
trading the same setup, on
the same time frame, on the



==================================================
                     PAGE 622                     
==================================================

same market for 20 years.
They don’t care about
anything else, and they don’t
want to learn about anything
else. This works for them,
and they are the masters of
this setup. They have nothing
else coming in to interfere
with their focus. If a setup
doesn’t happen that day, then
they don’t take a trade.
Other successful traders I
know have learned to



==================================================
                     PAGE 623                     
==================================================

discipline themselves
whenever they break their
stop loss rules. One trader I
know would jump into his
Chicago outside swimming
pool … in January. It took
two times, but he hasn’t
broken his stop loss rule
since. Another trader writes a
check to a charity he doesn’t
support, in this case the
ACLU. (That’s going to be
different for everyone.)



==================================================
                     PAGE 624                     
==================================================

When Jesse Livermore
was in the process of making
his fortune, one of his
favorite quotes was, “If I
bought a stock and it went
against me, I would sell it
immediately. You can’t stop
and try to figure out why a
stock is going in the wrong
direction. The fact is that it is
going in the wrong direction,
and that is enough evidence
for an experienced speculator
to close the trade.” Small



==================================================
                     PAGE 625                     
==================================================

losses make all the
difference, and traders must
learn to reward themselves
for doing their job in this
regard.
It is important to
remember that traders are not
trading stocks, or futures, or
options. Traders are trading
other traders. There is
another person or system out
there that is taking the
opposite side of the trade.



==================================================
                     PAGE 626                     
==================================================

One side is going to be right,
and the other side is going to
be wrong. Whoever has the
better psychological
perspective and money
management system in place
on this trade is going to win.
Is the trader on the other side
of the trade an amateur or a
professional? That trader
should be wondering the
same thing about you. The
next time you succumb to
greed and chase a trade,



==================================================
                     PAGE 627                     
==================================================

remember that there is a
professional somewhere else
in the world who has been
waiting patiently for this
setup and is doing just the
opposite.
I have found that the most
important step in becoming a
successful trader is just
learning how to accept a loss
without any anger or
frustration or shame. It’s just
part of trading. It’s not a big



==================================================
                     PAGE 628                     
==================================================

deal. I take losses every day,
and I do it live in front of
people all the time. It’s just
part of the process. Okay,
this trade just hit its stop.
Next. It’s like Tom Hanks’s
character in the movie A
League of Their Own, who
screams at his female player
and makes her cry. “Are you
crying?” he asks, shocked.
“There’s no crying in
baseball!”



==================================================
                     PAGE 629                     
==================================================

And there’s no crying in
trading and no throwing your
coffee cup against the wall or
screaming at your monitor.
Losses and missed trades are
just part of the deal. On some
days, things are just not
going to come together. If
I’m using a setup and I’m
stopped out two times in a
row, then I just stop using
that setup for the rest of the
day. For whatever reason, it
is out of sync with the



==================================================
                     PAGE 630                     
==================================================

markets on that particular
day. It’s no big deal. There is
no need to reformat the
MACD. It’s just part of
trading.
The key is to have two
specific sets of rules. First,
there needs to be a trading
methodology. For this setup,
do the traders go all in or
scale in? Do they scale out or
get all out at a specific
target? Do they trail a stop or



==================================================
                     PAGE 631                     
==================================================

leave it? Where is the stop
placement in relation to the
target? These are all things
that have to be set in stone
before the trade is placed.
Once the trade is placed,
there is no room for rational
thought. The setup has to be
followed the same way each
and every time, or the traders
will never be able to gauge
whether the setup is going to
help them or hurt them in
their trading. Without that



==================================================
                     PAGE 632                     
==================================================

information, they are just
making impulse trades, and
those are the sucker trades.
Second, there has to be a
money management rule.
How many shares or
contracts does a trader
allocate toward this setup?
How much equity is a trader
willing to risk on this setup
over the course of a day, a
week, a month, or a year?
After traders do this for a
while, what happens is that



==================================================
                     PAGE 633                     
==================================================

they develop the habit of
following their rules and they
eventually learn to trust
themselves.
Once traders learn to trust
themselves, they can then
free their mind to focus on
the market opportunities that
present themselves, instead
of being wrapped up tight in
a ball of fear, frustration, and
doubt. This is where traders
make the transition out of the



==================================================
                     PAGE 634                     
==================================================

first three phases and begin
to really have an opportunity
to do this for a living. The
transition involves focusing
on developing their own
trading skills instead of
focusing on the money. And
the skills are easy—keep
your emotions in check and
have the discipline to follow
the setups. Don’t focus on
making $1,000. That is what
the amateurs do. Focus on
developing your skills and



==================================================
                     PAGE 635                     
==================================================

executing the setups the same
way each and every time. It
sounds simple enough, but
I’ve worked with enough
traders to know that most of
them can’t do it over the long
haul. They get impatient and
don’t want to miss out on the
action, so they jump in and
chase without a clear setup.
Once they do this, they go
back into the barrel with all
the amateurs.



==================================================
                     PAGE 636                     
==================================================

Most of trading involves
waiting. First, it involves
waiting for a setup. Once the
setup occurs, then the
professional trader takes it
without hesitation. The skill
comes in waiting for it to set
up and not succumbing to an
impulse trade. Then, once
she is in a setup, a trader has
to have the discipline to wait
for the exit parameters to be
hit and not cave and bail out
too early. Waiting is the



==================================================
                     PAGE 637                     
==================================================

hardest thing for many
traders to do, but it’s the
waiting that separates the
winners from the losers.
Even for a day trade, it can
be hours before a setup
happens or a parameter is hit.
And that’s the whole key:
just being patient and
waiting. The person who
chases four rabbits catches
none.
Also, it is important to



==================================================
                     PAGE 638                     
==================================================

realize that professional
traders are not in every
move. It is okay to have the
market leave the station
without you. Catching every
move is impossible, but
chasing every move is the
mark of an amateur. This is
why it is imperative for
traders to have a set of rules
to follow for both entries and
exits, as opposed to relying
on their own gut feelings to
manage a position. Develop a



==================================================
                     PAGE 639                     
==================================================

set of rules and have the
discipline to follow them;
they exist for your
protection.
For me, the biggest
difference in my trading
occurred when I learned to
ignore my brain and just
focus on a handful of good
setups. Once I learned the
setups, the next challenge
was to have the discipline to
follow them the same way



==================================================
                     PAGE 640                     
==================================================

each and every time. No
thinking, no hemming and
hawing. I did this by
recording my trading activity
and grading myself on how
well I executed each setup,
instead of on how much
money I was making or
losing. Whereas focusing on
the P&L automatically
encourages the bad habits
that plague many traders, a
setup-based approach
encourages habits that can



==================================================
                     PAGE 641                     
==================================================

push a trader into the realm
of consistent profitability.
In the end, professional
traders focus on limiting risk
and protecting capital.
Amateur traders focus on
how much money they can
make on each trade.
Professional traders always
take money away from
amateurs. Amateur traders
start to turn into professional
traders once they stop

First off, I want to thank
Henry Gambell for updating
the technology part of this
chapter. When I first wrote
this book, I did pay some
attention to technology, but
now that I’m working with

he pretty much knows
everything there is to know
about it. The first time I met

==================================================

hard way! Let’s dive in.
This chapter is about
creating a level playing field
for all traders with respect to
the equipment and software
they are using to tackle the
markets. If traders can get
this part right, they are at
least going to have a fighting
chance to compete on a level
playing field with everybody
else. If traders are behind the
technology curve, they are



==================================================
                     PAGE 652                     
==================================================

going to be at a distinct
disadvantage in their trading.
In trading, someone without
an edge in terms of
equipment, mental outlook,
and methodology is like a
newborn, wounded
wildebeest trying to snatch a
drink at the edge of a
crocodile pond. In other
words, he ain’t gonna make

plan by having trading
software or technology that is
outdated? It would be like
entering the Daytona 500
with a Winnebago. This is
the easiest part of a solid
trading plan, and it is 100
percent under a person’s
control.
The amount and type of
trading equipment that a
trader has is going to depend
a little on her own financial

                     PAGE 654                     
==================================================

resources, and a lot on the
type of trading she is doing.
There are several things to
remember when purchasing a
new PC, the first being that
you’re purchasing a
depreciating asset. Intel
cofounder Gordon E. Moore
stated in 1965 that the
number of transistors that
could be placed on a circuit
board would double every
two years. His prediction was
uncannily accurate, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 655                     
==================================================

processing speed continues
to grow exponentially. The
semiconductor industry uses
this law in its long-term
planning, and you should too.
As this law continues to hold
true, cost continues to drop,
and the PC you buy today is
likely to be eclipsed in three
to four years, if not sooner.
Rather than spending $5,000
on a be-all and end-all
system, a trader can buy a
well-equipped PC for under



==================================================
                     PAGE 656                     
==================================================

$2,000 (not including
displays), upgrade in two
years, and still be ahead of
the pack.
There are several key
components of a PC’s
performance. For traders, the
most important is RAM.
Random-access memory is
the storage medium used for
running applications. Every
chart, Word document, or
Internet browser you open



==================================================
                     PAGE 657                     
==================================================

occupies RAM. If you notice
that your PC runs great when
you have a single application
open, but is sluggish or
unusable when you are
running several charting
platforms, RAM is probably
the culprit. RAM prices
continue to fall rapidly. As
I’m writing this on August
10, 2011, Newegg.com
boasts 8 GB of DDR3 (very
fast RAM) for $48.99. That’s
10 double lattes at Starbucks.



==================================================
                     PAGE 658                     
==================================================

These prices make it very
feasible for you to have a
desktop that’s stuffed to the
gills with RAM, and this is
one investment you won’t
regret. Now, before you go
out and order three pallets of
the stuff, be sure to check
your existing system
specifications. RAM is
limited physically by the
number of available slots in
your PC and limited in
software by what’s referred



==================================================
                     PAGE 659                     
==================================================

to as the 4-GB limit. In short,
traders who are looking to
use more than 4 GB of RAM
should make sure that their
motherboard and BIOS
support it and be running a
64-bit version of Windows.
(Now you understand why I
have someone like Henry
helping me out instead of
trying to figure this out for
myself. Keep reading,
however, as this will get
easier.)



==================================================
                     PAGE 660                     
==================================================

The next component to
decide on is your processor.
In the mid-2000s, the focus
of chip manufacturers was all
about speed, or how many
gigahertz they could squeeze
out of a chip. The focus has
now shifted to the number of
cores, and as a result, overall
performance has grown
exponentially. Think of this
as follows: would you rather
commute to work on a 1-lane
highway with a 70-mile-an-



==================================================
                     PAGE 661                     
==================================================

hour speed limit, or on a 12-
lane highway with a 60-mile-
an-hour speed limit? The
new chips have 12 lanes,
making getting to your
destination that much faster.
Traders really benefit
from this technology, as it
allows them to do more
things at once without having
wait for their computer to
catch up. Intel currently
dominates the high-



==================================================
                     PAGE 662                     
==================================================

performance market with its
flagship i7 2600k processor.
This is the first chip to ship
“unlocked,” meaning that
users can turbocharge their
PC to speeds that were just
dreamt about five years ago.
A trader’s computer
should be set up specifically
for trading and have a
minimum of other stuff going
on. If there are kids in the
house, make sure they have



==================================================
                     PAGE 663                     
==================================================

their own computer for
Internet surfing and
computer games. Believe me,
gaming manufacturers fully
understand that kids know
how to click buttons, and
many of those buttons
automatically start
downloading a variety of
crap and spyware right onto
your computer. When you’re
on your PC, follow the
Golden Rule—if you don’t
know who it’s from or what

it is, don’t open it. Or if it
seems like an odd request,
don’t follow it. Assume it is
a trick (because it probably
is). If it’s real and important,
the person will get back to
you. Let me put it this way:
every time I’ve shown Henry
a link I didn’t click, he said,
“Thank you for not clicking
that and destroying your
computer.” When in doubt,
think it out.

What About Monitors,
Graphics Cards, and Other
Gizmos?
One question I receive a lot
from traders is, “How many
monitors do I need?” This
really depends on what you
are trading. I personally
utilize six monitors for
viewing charts and two
additional monitors for other
tasks such as e-mail, instant
messaging, and Internet



==================================================
                     PAGE 666                     
==================================================

surfing. These are set up on
two different computers,
using software called Input
Director to share a mouse
and keyboard across both
computers. This means I
don’t need a separate
keyboard and mouse for each
computer, which is really
awesome. The mouse arrow
just glides along from one
computer to the next and
makes it seem like the setup
is all part of one giant



==================================================
                     PAGE 667                     
==================================================

monster computer, instead of
two separate ones. (Note: I
also like to sit on a balance
ball for about half the day.
This keeps your core strong
and helps prevent
backaches.) I used to trade
out of my house, and then we
had … three children. I now
trade out of an apartment a
few miles away from my
house. It was quiet for a
while, and then I started
hiring people to help with the



==================================================
                     PAGE 668                     
==================================================

website, so that I could
actually keep trading. That
got too noisy (like having …
three kids), so I got another
apartment for them to work
out of. I guess right now if
we keep growing, we will
keep adding more
apartments.
Most traders do not need
six or eight monitors, and I
know traders who make a
great living with just two.



==================================================
                     PAGE 669                     
==================================================

There’s a real danger in
having too many monitors, as
a trader can quickly find
himself with information
overload. I visited one trader
who had 25 monitors
shooting data at him from all
directions. Shockingly, he
could never decide when to
pull the trigger to get into a
trade. It is important to
remember that traders don’t
need to know everything that
is going on in the markets.



==================================================
                     PAGE 670                     
==================================================

They just need enough
information to be able to
decide whether or not to take
their setup, to understand
their small corner of the
trading universe. All of the
successful traders I know
focus on just a handful of
setups. They don’t need a
confirming move in crude oil
in order to take their buy
signal on the S&Ps. If traders
have found one or two setups
that really work for them,



==================================================
                     PAGE 671                     
==================================================

then they can, and should,
ignore a lot of the data out
there. Laserlike focus on a
small part of the markets
brings expertise and a better
understanding of when to
take a trade. Remember, the
goal is to make money, not to
“know it all.”
As the cost of LCD
displays continues to drop,
setting up your desired
number of monitors becomes



==================================================
                     PAGE 672                     
==================================================

feasible on almost any
budget. For traders, several
of the high-end features
available in monitors today
are not necessary. One
feature that you will want to
be sure you have is that the
display complies with the
VESA standard. The VESA
standard is what is used for
mounting displays and
ensures that your monitor can
be removed from its factory
stand and secured to a third-



==================================================
                     PAGE 673                     
==================================================

party mounting device. The
other key feature you need to
focus on is the monitor’s
native resolution. Native
resolution tells you how
many pixels wide by how
many pixels tall your display
is. The number of pixels can
be adjusted, but in order to
get the best picture possible,
you’ll want to run the display
at its native resolution. The
higher the resolution, the
more content you’ll be able



==================================================
                     PAGE 674                     
==================================================

to fit on your screen. If you
and a trading partner have
the exact same monitor, but
one of you is able to fit more
onto a chart than the other,
resolution is the likely
culprit.
The monitors we use and
recommend are Dell
UltraSharp U2410s. These
24-inch monitors have
accurate color reproduction,
a native resolution of 1,920 ×



==================================================
                     PAGE 675                     
==================================================

1,200, and six different
inputs, meaning that you
could run your TV’s cable
box into one of the monitors
via an HDMI cable and use it
as your television if you like.
How you connect these
displays to your PC can vary
depending on the video card
you choose, but DisplayPort
is quickly becoming the
standard for digital video
connections. The adoption of
DisplayPort technology is



==================================================
                     PAGE 676                     
==================================================

exciting because it is a
royalty-free standard. This
means that companies won’t
have to pay to include
DisplayPort technology with
their devices the way they
did with Sony’s
MemoryStick format
(currently JPY 500,000, or
roughly $6,500 U.S. as of
this writing). Anytime a
standard like this is adopted,
it’s great for the consumer, as
more devices will include the



==================================================
                     PAGE 677                     
==================================================

technology and there’s a
better chance of the
standard’s sticking around.
Another area of interest
for traders is setting up
multiple monitors in such a
way that they fit comfortably
on a desk, don’t take up a lot
of space, and are easy to
access. One site I like for this
is www.lcdarms.com. Here
traders can get different wall-
and desk-mounting solutions



==================================================
                     PAGE 678                     
==================================================

for their monitors. In terms
of desks and chairs, this is
really wide open. A door
across two file cabinets
works really well as a desk.
There are desks available
from medical supply
companies that are
interesting in terms of how
they are set up. The desk
isn’t that big a deal, however.
Traders just need a place to
put their computer
equipment. For chairs, I



==================================================
                     PAGE 679                     
==================================================

switch between what might
considered Porsche and Pinto
setups, using a Herman
Miller Aeron chair and a 75-
cm aerobic balance ball.
Both are good for posture,
and I find that switching
throughout the day keeps me
more alert. The balance ball
is awesome because it
strengthens your lower back
and core muscles as your
body works to keep you “in
balance” while you are



==================================================
                     PAGE 680                     
==================================================

sitting on the ball.
Now that you’ve got your
displays lined up and
mounted, what are you going
to use to push them? Most
desktop PCs ship with
support for dual monitors.
Once you step outside that
realm, things can get a little
exotic. The Nvidia NVS line
of graphics cards provides
some of the best I’ve come
across and offers a reliable



==================================================
                     PAGE 681                     
==================================================

solution at an affordable
price. This line of cards is
geared toward traders and
features slim video cards that
push high-resolution
displays. It also features
Nvidia’s Mosaic multidisplay
technology. Mosaic allows
you to span any application
across multiple displays or
projectors from a single
workstation without
sacrificing performance or
power. You can learn more

Why Are SSDs Important to
Traders?
The typical progression for
technology is to grow
incrementally up to a plateau,
then leap to the next level.
One example would be the
processor scenario I
mentioned at the beginning
of the chapter. Speeds get



==================================================
                     PAGE 683                     
==================================================

faster and faster until a
physical barrier is reached,
then we leap over it by
introducing several cores to
replace one. The same is true
for hard drives. A hard drive
is the physical disk that your
data are stored on. Every
document that you create and
every cookie that attaches
itself to your browser is
stored on your hard drive.
Hard drives have grown in
capacity for years, but they



==================================================
                     PAGE 684                     
==================================================

continue to use the exact
same technology of storing
your data on spinning
magnetic disks. We’ve
gradually drifted into the 3-
terabyte range, where the
limits of data storage are
being pushed. This spurred
the next leap in technology
for consumer hard drives,
and once you try a solid-state
drive in your PC, you won’t
go back.



==================================================
                     PAGE 685                     
==================================================

Solid-state drives (SSDs)
have revolutionized the hard
drive market. Rather than
using spinning disks to store
your data, they use flash
memory. The key difference
between the hard disk drives
that traders are used to and
SSDs is that SSDs have no
moving parts. This means
that when you pull up your
favorite trading platform,
your drive doesn’t have to
spin up, seek the location of



==================================================
                     PAGE 686                     
==================================================

the software on the drive, and
then, finally, launch. It just
launches. Boom.
SSDs are also much more
durable. For the traveling
executive who is prone to
dropping laptops, an SSD is
crucial. Since these drives
have no moving parts, not
only are they much faster,
but they are able to withstand
things such as falling from a
desk. Then there’s PCIe



==================================================
                     PAGE 687                     
==================================================

SSDs. While this is still
bleeding-edge technology, it
makes even SSDs look slow.
These drives use the same
flash memory as a normal
SSD, but then stripe the disks
for faster read and write
times and connect to the PC
through a different
connection. The current price
for a 220-GB PCIe SSD is
$480, so they’re not giving
them away just yet, but if
you demand the fastest

this is the only way to go.
Have Apple Computers
Arrived in the Trading
World?
Apple computers were once
thought of as PCs for
musicians and artists, with no
real place in the business
world. This belief is quickly
losing ground as the
company continues to make

==================================================

some of the most reliable
computers money can buy.
As far as hardware goes, the
part of the machine you can
actually touch, Apple excels.
Its most recent line of
MacBook Pros has a solid
aluminum body and
touchpads that are easy to
use. I don’t leave home
without mine, and I highly
recommend them. This
recommendation doesn’t
come without a few caveats,



==================================================
                     PAGE 690                     
==================================================

however. Despite Apple’s
increase in popularity, 98
percent of trading software
still requires Microsoft
Windows to run. For a long
time, this kept most traders
from even considering the
purchase of a Mac. Then two
pivotal events changed all
that. The first of these came
in 2005, when Steve Jobs
announced that Apple would
make the transition from
PowerPC processors to Intel



==================================================
                     PAGE 691                     
==================================================

x86 processors. With the
integration of these high-
performance Intel chips, the
door was opened for major
advances in virtualization.
Virtualization is the creation
of a virtual (rather than an
actual) version of something,
in this case an operating
system. What this meant for
traders was that they could
have the benefits of Apple
hardware and stability, and
still run their trading

                     PAGE 692                     
==================================================

applications on Windows.
There are several ways to
do this, with the most
popular being Apple’s Boot
Camp software or Parallels
Desktop. The key difference
between the two is that Boot
Camp runs Windows on
“bare metal,” so to speak,
and has direct access to the
processing power of your
machine. Parallels runs
Windows inside an

                     PAGE 693                     
==================================================

application, similar to
opening a workspace inside
your trading platform. This
method will have some
overhead, but this is usually
negligible provided you have
a powerful enough machine.
If this is something you’re
interested in, the Intel i7 line
of processors with plenty of
RAM is a clear-cut choice.
For users of the thinkorswim
platform, the developers

Taming the Technological
Beast: What Dangers
Should I Be Aware of When
It Comes to My Computer?
Once traders have their
hardware in place, it is time
for them to turn their
attention to the software.
There are a lot of software
choices available for traders,



==================================================
                     PAGE 695                     
==================================================

but what this boils down to
for most people is a charting
program and an execution
package. While these are
important, there is another
category of software that is
vital to the trader, and this is
software aimed at keeping a
computer in top working
order. This is by far the most
neglected area for traders.
Let’s take a look at this first,
and then we will dive into the
trading software.

                     PAGE 696                     
==================================================

Trading in and of itself
can be one of the most
stressful occupations on the
planet. One day’s worth of
market activity can
determine whether a trader
drives a new Shelby Mustang
or takes the bus to work.
Technological problems or
disruptions increase the
stress factor and cause drains
of both real and mental
capital. Traders who are
stuck behind the technology

==================================================

curve are at more of a
disadvantage than those who
are up to speed. From
software that is outdated to
those Windows Updates that
sit idle in your system tray
for months (or years), traders
who choose technological
ignorance are setting
themselves up for disaster.
Having a trade go wrong
because of technological
issues is inexcusable for the
serious trader who is trying



==================================================
                     PAGE 698                     
==================================================

to make a living at this
profession.
The bottom line is that
traders who want to maintain
a competitive edge in this
business must first be aware
of the technological dangers
facing them in today’s world.
Once they are aware of the
hurdles, determined traders
must then take a proactive
approach and take the time to
attack these issues head on.

The three main technological
problems for traders today
are as follows:
• PC invaders. Where the
trend used to be
attacking users’ PCs for
group recognition or to
maim your data, the
biggest threat now is
intruders that infect your
PC and then sit idle.
Once this type of
software is on your PC,

it waits for commands
from its creator, then
uses your PC’s resources
and Internet bandwidth
to attack other PCs or
networks. One of the
more recent examples
was Koobface, an
anagram of “Facebook”
that spread through the
social networking site.
The authors of these
viruses are paid per

masters,” who are
looking to use their
newly assembled army
for everything from
extortion to DDoS
attacks. A study by the
Information Warfare
Monitor, a joint
collaboration between
SecDev Group and the
Citizen Lab in the Munk
School of Global Affairs
at the University of
Toronto, has revealed



==================================================
                     PAGE 702                     
==================================================

that the operators of this
scheme have generated
more than $2 million in
revenue from June 2009
to June 2010. In other
words, if you are online,
your computer is open
for attack.
• Badware. Badware is
software that
fundamentally
disregards a user’s
choice about how her

Like most jargon in a
field, terms such as
spyware, malware, and
scareware just confuse
the consumer and should
all be grouped under the
badware umbrella. This
gamut of software can
cause a slew of PC
problems, from slow
performance to false
blue screens of death

Keeping this software
off your computer is a
must.
• General technology
problems. This category
includes power failure,
data loss, and hardware
failure, and a trader
should have a plan for
each.

What Is the Best and Easiest
Way to Build a Strong
Defense for Your Trading
Computer?
Traders can have the best
software available for
trading, but if their computer



==================================================
                     PAGE 706                     
==================================================

isn’t properly cared for,
protected, and maintained,
then the greatest trading
software in the world
becomes worthless. For the
trader who is serious about
making this business a full-
time job, neglecting these
next steps is the same as a
professional football player
drinking a 12-pack of beer
the night before he is
supposed to play in the Super
Bowl. In other words, it ain’t

                     PAGE 707                     
==================================================

gonna help.
The first step in avoiding
these pitfalls is connecting a
router to your network. A
router is a simple device that
most users know as the hub
for their wireless Internet
access. Routers not only
direct the user’s traffic, but,
more important, provide a
hardware firewall. Hardware
firewalls are superior to
software solutions because



==================================================
                     PAGE 708                     
==================================================

they take up zero PC
resources and can’t be
modified by an infection that
might make its way onto
your PC. Even if you have
only one hardwired PC, you
should have a router.
The next step is choosing
your security software.
Antivirus software is one of
the easiest forms of computer
security to manage and is
often overlooked. It’s fairly



==================================================
                     PAGE 709                     
==================================================

common to find traders using
the expired trial version of a
security package that came
with their computer or a
“free” version of enterprise
security software that a
friend installed for them.
This is risky not only
because you don’t know the
origin of the software, but
also because you can’t
guarantee that the software
will operate as expected.



==================================================
                     PAGE 710                     
==================================================

I prefer a basic antivirus
program rather than a full-
fledged “Internet security
solution.” Security solutions
often try to do too many
things within a single
program and end up doing
none of them well. Norton
360 5.0 offers PC tune-up,
data backup, parental
controls, a “safe web” social
media scanner—the list goes
on and on and on. When
programs have this many



==================================================
                     PAGE 711                     
==================================================

things running inside a single
application, not only do they
tend to be subpar, but they
also take up a large amount
of resources. The more
resources that are consumed
by security software, the less
that are available for your
trading applications.
There are two antivirus
solutions I recommend,
Microsoft Security Essentials
and NOD32. Security



==================================================
                     PAGE 712                     
==================================================

Essentials is a totally free
solution provided directly
from Microsoft. This
program sports a clean user
interface that’s easy to
understand and provides
automatic updates. The other
solution is NOD32. NOD32
is what I recommend for
users who like to have more
hands-on control of their
security. This program offers
a good range of features
without being a burden and



==================================================
                     PAGE 713                     
==================================================

can be purchased at
www.eset.com for $60.
Another way to keep your
PC free of badware is to stop
using Internet Explorer, or at
least make sure you’re
running the latest version.
All spyware programs are
written for this browser,
since this is what comes with
Windows. In 1997, Internet
Explorer made up more than
50 percent of the browsers



==================================================
                     PAGE 714                     
==================================================

used on the web. This
number has dropped
significantly and now is
about 25 percent of browsers
used, as Firefox and Chrome
have snuck into the market,
taking 42 percent and 30
percent of traffic,
respectively. There are a few
other browsers that make up
the remaining percentage, but
most users should stick to the
big three. I personally use
Chrome first, Firefox second,



==================================================
                     PAGE 715                     
==================================================

and, if I truly have no other
choice, I’ll use Internet
Explorer. It’s now the clunky
old dinosaur.
What’s the Best Way to Keep
a Machine Running Like
New?
Once traders have their
antivirus software configured
and happily scanning, they
need to make sure the
everyday junk is cleared out



==================================================
                     PAGE 716                     
==================================================

of their PC. Just like a car,
PCs need to have basic
maintenance if they’re
expected to perform. This
used to be as simple as
making a quick trip over to
Internet Explorer’s
preferences and clearing out
your cache and cookies. Now
traders can have two or three
browsers storing these files,
not to mention temporary
files that Windows creates
through normal use.



==================================================
                     PAGE 717                     
==================================================

Fortunately there’s a
program called CCleaner that
handles all this in one fell
swoop. This program is 100
percent free with an option to
donate and does a good job
of cleaning out cookies,
temporary files, and all the
other miscellaneous junk that
sits on a trader’s PC.
Defragmenting is quickly
becoming a thing of the past
as SSD drives enter the



==================================================
                     PAGE 718                     
==================================================

market (where defragmenting
is not needed), and for users
running hard disk drives,
Windows 7 schedules this
task automatically. By the
way, Windows 7 is the best
choice for traders. Vista is
horrible, and XP is old and
outdated.
Why Are Cookies and Spam
Bad News for Trading
Computers, and How Can I
Prevent Them?



==================================================
                     PAGE 719                     
==================================================

Another device that
companies use to track
information on the trader’s
PC is called a cookie. This is
a small text file that can be
good or bad. It’s good when
you’re visiting a favorite
website, such as
Amazon.com. With a cookie
installed, Amazon will
remember who the users are,
so they don’t have to always
log in when they visit the
site. However, there are also



==================================================
                     PAGE 720                     
==================================================

bad cookies placed by
companies such as Double-
Click that track site usage,
coordinate pop-up ads, and
generally invade the trader’s
privacy. The best thing to do
here is to start from scratch
and delete all the cookies on
your computer. This can be
accomplished by using the
previously mentioned
CCleaner or by going to
Start, Settings, Control Panel,
Internet Options. Under



==================================================
                     PAGE 721                     
==================================================

Temporary Internet Files,
there is a button that says,
“Delete Cookies.” Click this.
After the cookies are deleted,
go to Privacy, Advanced.
Once you are there, check the
box that says “Override
automatic cookie handling.”
Below that I check “Prompt”
for First-Party Cookies and
“Block” for Third-Party
Cookies. This way, when the
trader goes to Amazon, a
message pops up asking



==================================================
                     PAGE 722                     
==================================================

whether the trader wants to
accept the cookie. I say yes
because that is a site I visit
often. Any third-party
cookies like DoubleClick
will automatically be
blocked. This will prevent
pop-up ads and keep the
trader’s computer running in
top form. If I am asked to
accept a cookie from a site I
rarely visit, I will say no
(only because “hell, no” isn’t
an option), and the cookie



==================================================
                     PAGE 723

will not be planted on my
computer.
Spam is a big problem for
everyone, and I owe my
eternal gratitude to Gmail
(Google’s e-mail service) for
solving this problem. Gmail
has the most powerful spam
filters on the planet. I’ve
been using the service since
it was in its invite only stage,
and I’m still a diehard fan.
Gmail is a web-based e-mail



==================================================
                     PAGE 724                     
==================================================

solution, meaning that you
don’t have to have any
software installed on your PC
to receive e-mail like you do
with Outlook. Gmail
supports POP3 and SMTP,
so you can still use a Gmail
address in conjunction with
your personal domain. It also
supports Google Labs, a user
community that creates plug-
ins for your e-mail and
enables a wealth of features.
Gmail also supports IMAP, a



==================================================
                     PAGE 725                     
==================================================

standard that allows users to
read a message on their
phone, reply to it, and have
these changes immediately
reflected anywhere they log
on to the account. If you’re
still struggling with syncing
your e-mail between multiple
devices or find yourself
buried under a pile of spam,
it’s time to give Gmail a try.
Yahoo! and Hotmail are old
school. Gmail is new school.
Speaking of old school, I was



==================================================
                     PAGE 726                     
==================================================

a diehard Microsoft Outlook
fan for about 10 years. Henry
showed me the light in terms
of making the transition to
Gmail and Google Calendar.
It took me a few months to
get used to it, but once I
embraced it, I never looked
back. With Outlook, I was
tied to one computer, and it
was clunky. With Google
Calendar and Gmail, I can
easily access my information
from any computer, sync



==================================================
                     PAGE 727                     
==================================================

everything automatically
with my phone, and easily
share my calendar and key
documents with other people
via Google Documents. No
more e-mailing documents
back and forth, wondering
which one is the current
version. Welcome to the
future.
the trend used to be
attackingShould I Be Using
a 32-or 64-Bit Operating



==================================================
                     PAGE 728                     
==================================================

System?
We’ve been able to keep the
tech jargon to a bare
minimum thus far, but it’s
worth taking a moment to
explain the difference
between 32-and 64-bit
operating systems. The
amount of information
traders need to know on the
topic is fairly basic, and we’ll
keep it that way.
Everything with



==================================================
                     PAGE 729                     
==================================================

computers is just 1s and 0s.
A bit is either populated or
not, on or off. So for a 32-bit
operating system, we have 2
to the 32nd power, giving us
4,294,967,295, or 4 GB of
RAM. Any 32-bit operating
system is limited by
definition to this 32-bit
virtual address space, and if
you install more RAM than
the operating system can
handle, it will simply ignore
it. It has no way to address



==================================================
                     PAGE 730                     
==================================================

this additional storage.
You’ll remember that toward
the beginning of the chapter,
we mentioned RAM and how
the more of it you had, the
faster your system would be.
So how do we get past the 4-
GB limit? The easy answer is
moving to a 64-bit machine.
We now have hardware and
software that can take
advantage of these advances,
and when we take the on or
off state of a bit, and then



==================================================
                     PAGE 731                     
==================================================

take it to the 64th power,
we’re given enough address
space to have several
terabytes of RAM. If you’re
looking to really max out
your PC, you’ll want to be
aware of the amount of
memory that each version of
Windows supports, and I’ve
listed a few here. Windows
Starter and Home Basic
editions support a maximum
of 8 GB, Home Premium
supports 16 GB, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 732                     
==================================================

Professional and above
support 192 GB. Obviously
some of these numbers aren’t
yet practical in a normal
computer, but I have no
doubt they will be in the near
future.
This same 32- vs. 64-bit
theory applies to applications
you install. Once an
application can access more
than 4 GB of RAM, you can
have much more going on



==================================================
                     PAGE 733                     
==================================================

within that application.
While trading platforms now
are limited in the amount of
data that can be accessed at
one time, 64-bit platforms
are emerging and will be able
to handle much more data
efficiently. What this means
for traders is the ability to
run more charts and more
platforms and have fewer
platform snags than we
currently do.



==================================================
                     PAGE 734                     
==================================================

The 32/64-bit issue will
eventually be a thing of the
past, just like 8- and 16-bit
computing. Until this
transition is complete, just
remember that 64 bits equals
more memory and more
performance.
What Are the Best Solutions
for Protecting Data?
Anyone who’s been around
computers long enough will



==================================================
                     PAGE 735                     
==================================================

tell you that the most
expensive part of a PC is the
data. Anything like a hard
drive crash, a power surge
that fries internal
components, or this
morning’s espresso that
didn’t play nice with your
laptop keyboard can destroy
data. Once data are lost, data
recovery procedures can be
tedious and expensive, and
do not guarantee recovery of
your precious data. This



==================================================
                     PAGE 736                     
==================================================

includes everything from
pictures and music to
platform workspaces,
indicators, and portfolio
spreadsheets. Fortunately,
data backup procedures have
advanced with technology,
and in this day and age,
there’s no excuse to ever lose
a single document. Services
like Carbonite will back up
your data automatically to
the cloud, where they are
encrypted and stored should



==================================================
                     PAGE 737                     
==================================================

you need them.
In discussing the
preservation of your digital
life, it’s important to
understand the two main
types of backup. The first,
and my preferred method for
backing up critical data, is
the easiest and entails simply
dragging the files from your
local drive to an external
drive. This keeps your data in
their exact original form, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 738                     
==================================================

should you experience a
crash, you can plug the drive
into another PC and quickly
have access to your files.
This method can also be used
in conjunction with services
like Dropbox. Dropbox
creates a new folder on your
PC. Anything that is placed
inside that folder is uploaded
to its storage service and is
accessible from all your
connected devices. Not only
does this accomplish the task



==================================================
                     PAGE 739                     
==================================================

of backing up data, but it
makes it easy to make
changes to a file at the office
and have the exact same
changes reflected on the
document when you return
home. For example, when
working on this book, I had a
Dropbox folder on five
different computers. I could
access this folder from any of
the five computers, open up a
chapter, make a few updates,
and, voilà, this chapter was



==================================================
                     PAGE 740                     
==================================================

automatically updated across
all five computers. This is
way easier than e-mailing
files back and forth to
different computers. I also
keep my TradeStation
workspaces in this Dropbox
folder, so that I can access
them from any PC.
The second type of data
backup is known as imaging.
Think of an image backup as
just that: a snapshot, or



==================================================
                     PAGE 741                     
==================================================

image, of your PC. While the
backup methods discussed up
to this point back up only
user data, imaged backups
literally back up everything:
user data, temporary files, the
operating system with
updates—literally
everything. This is taken and
stored in such a way that if
your hard drive were to
crash, you could replace the
drive, run the imaging
software, and not miss a beat.



==================================================
                     PAGE 742                     
==================================================

Trading platforms,
indicators, pictures, and
documents, along with every
personal setting and
application on your machine,
are preserved with an imaged
backup. I do both methods of
backup on anything that’s
important to me. I then take
those backups and make sure
they’re available in three
different forms. Backups
should be stored locally for
quick recovery and off site



==================================================
                     PAGE 743                     
==================================================

for protection against natural
disasters and theft, and then
having a copy in the cloud
completes the trifecta. While
I do love cloud storage, I
typically do not upload
image backups to online data
storage simply because of
their size. I do keep physical
copies in multiple remote
locations, however.
Data aren’t the only thing
that traders need to have



==================================================
                     PAGE 744                     
==================================================

backups of. Power outages
can and will happen, and
battery backups are a must.
These are available at any
major office supply shop. In
the event of a loss of
electricity, these will give the
trader around 30 minutes of
power, which is plenty of
time to close out positions or
reset parameters in case the
power is going to be down
for a long time. This also
gives the trader time to shut



==================================================
                     PAGE 745                     
==================================================

down the computer
manually, which is much
safer than having it go out
suddenly because of a power
loss.
The third thing a trader
needs to be prepared for is a
loss of Internet. Cable and
DSL connections can go out
even when the electricity is
still on, and this will
undoubtedly happen at the
absolute worst time.



==================================================
                     PAGE 746                     
==================================================

Broadband saturation has
grown in the United States,
and it’s now affordable for a
trader to have not only a
cable connection, but also a
fiber or DSL line as backup.
These connections can be run
into a single device called a
dual-WAN (wide-area
network) router, and should
one go out, no action is
necessary on the part of the
trader. The second
connection simply picks up



==================================================
                     PAGE 747                     
==================================================

where the first left off, and
ideally the end user never
sees this hiccup. If this fails,
the next step is direct contact
with your broker.
The trend in the industry
is for brokers to let
computers do all the work.
Although this provides for
efficiencies and cuts costs,
the bottom line is that if I
have a problem, I had better
be able to get hold of my



==================================================
                     PAGE 748                     
==================================================

brokers right away. If I call
my brokers and can’t get
hold of them, I start foaming
at the mouth—a signal that it
is time for me to switch
brokers. If I want to be put
on hold, I will call the
airlines, not my brokers. My
suggestion here is to take
advantage of technology and
get your broker or brokers
hooked up on an instant
messaging program. This is
an incredibly efficient way to



==================================================
                     PAGE 749                     
==================================================

stay in touch throughout the
day. If my data feed goes
down, I can IM (instant
message) my broker for a
quote. My expectations for
my brokers are that I can
contact them via phone or
instant message right away.
If they are not available, then
I have the number and instant
message as a backup. In
trading, there is no excuse for
not being able to get a live
person to help out with an



==================================================
                     PAGE 750                     
==================================================

order or question right away.
What else are we paying
them all the commissions
for? Of course, another
option now is having a
broker who is wired into
your mobile phone. I use my
iPhone to check quotes on
my thinkorswim platform all
the time. And, if need be, I
can place a trade over my
iPhone or iPad as well.
If the trader’s data feed



==================================================
                     PAGE 751                     
==================================================

goes down, much of what
already has been discussed
will help. Being able to
contact a broker to get a
quote or place a trade in this
situation is imperative.
Yahoo! Finance is also a
great site to get free quotes
on stocks, options, and
futures.
Trading successfully
requires an edge. Traders
who choose to remain in



==================================================
                     PAGE 752                     
==================================================

ignorance about what is
really going on with their
computer, or who are “outta
luck” when the power goes
out, are leaving themselves at
a decided disadvantage
compared with traders who
are prepared. By staying up
to date on the technological
front, the trader has an
advantage over those who
don’t. And having an
advantage over other traders
is the only thing that will



==================================================
                     PAGE 753                     
==================================================

make the trader a winner in
this business.
Technology can, of
course, get outdated quickly.
Henry has put together a free
video and list of specs at
www.tradethemarkets.com/hardware

Why Aren’t All Quotes
Created Equal?
Now that we’ve beaten the
nontrading technical issues to



==================================================
                     PAGE 754                     
==================================================

death, let’s look at issues
geared specifically to trading.
This typically comes down to
three areas:
1. Quote software
2. Trade execution
software
3. Market-related
subscriptions and
services
Let’s look at quote



==================================================
                     PAGE 755                     
==================================================

software first. Much of the
decision to use a specific
charting software package
typically comes down to
“whatever a person stumbled
across” as he began the
trading journey, typically as
the result of a commercial he
saw during the Super Bowl.
For most traders, this is not a
good thing. I remember when
I first started trading online
in the early 1990s, and I had
to hit “refresh” every time I



==================================================
                     PAGE 756                     
==================================================

needed a new quote. I was
charged a fee each time I hit
“refresh” if I didn’t trade
enough. I stayed with that
brokerage for about three
weeks, and that was three
weeks too long. It is
important for the trader to
have a quote system that is
robust, is in real time, and
has the flexibility to easily
add a variety of indicators
and tools. The ultimate goal
of traders is to develop a



==================================================
                     PAGE 757                     
==================================================

trading style that best fits
their own personality. A
flexible quote system gives
people the ability to try
different markets until they
find the setups and
techniques that work best for
them. There are only a few
quote vendors that fit this
bill, and there are many that
do not. The bottom line is
that good quotes are not free
and can easily run a few
hundred dollars a month.



==================================================
                     PAGE 758                     
==================================================

Skimp on the desk, not on
the quotes.
Since this book was first
published, thinkorswim
(www.thinkorswim.com) has
developed a quote system
and trading platform that is
not only is robust but free.
Tom Sosnoff had a great idea
when he decided to give the
client everything for free. It
was such a great idea that
clients flocked to this



==================================================
                     PAGE 759                     
==================================================

platform, and it grew so fast
that it attracted the attention
of TD Ameritrade, which
recently purchased
thinkorswim (TOS) and is
incorporating this platform
under its umbrella. This is a
platform that I started using
shortly after this book was
first published in 2006. It has
continued to deliver the
goods, and I continue to use
it for quotes, charting, and
execution for trading options



==================================================
                     PAGE 760                     
==================================================

and stocks. It is also in the
process of moving into
futures—the first
powerhouse broker to do so.
It is going to change the
playing field by bringing
futures trading within reach
of anyone (see Figure 3.1).
I also utilize TradeStation
(www.tradestation.com).
TradeStation makes it
possible for me to easily add
my own indicators and



==================================================
                     PAGE 761                     
==================================================

studies, and I like its chart
functionality and its ability to
back-test specific setups and
data. I also love its Radar
Screen tool, which allows me
to look at signals on multiple
markets and time frames (see
Figure 3.2). TradeStation is
also in the process of coming
out with a lot of awesome
new trade analysis tools, and
I’m looking forward to
utilizing them as it rolls them
out. I typically use



==================================================
                     PAGE 762                     
==================================================

TradeStation to trade options
and futures. I like eSignal
because it has fast reloading
time and is robust and easy to
use. Recently I also started
using the charts at Infinity
Futures
(www.infinityfutures.com),
as this company has also
come out with a robust free
quote platform for futures. I
primarily use its platform to
day-trade futures. As of this
writing, thinkorswim and



==================================================

Infinity provide free quotes,
while TradeStation and
eSignal charge monthly fees
for data.

Another good source that
I use for futures quotes is the
market data available at the
Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME Group). Its
website is
www.cmegroup.com. For
futures traders, information
on quotes, open interest,
front month, option activity,
trading hours—it’s all there,



==================================================
                     PAGE 768                     
==================================================

especially now, since the
CME Group owns the
Chicago Board of Trade and
the New York Mercantile
Exchange. There are, of
course, other good quote
systems available. The key is
to utilize a robust and
flexible version that best fits
a trader’s needs. For the most
part, traders will get what
they pay for in this area. The
best way to find a good quote
system is, first and foremost,



==================================================
                     PAGE 769                     
==================================================

to ignore any marketing
material that is put out by the
company itself. Looking at
that is like believing that a
can of soda is good for you
because it says “diet” on the
label. One of the biggest
marketing gimmicks in
trading is “free level II data.”
Level II data are worthless
and shouldn’t be watched in
the first place. Larger traders
use level II to trick and fool
smaller traders by putting up



==================================================
                     PAGE 770                     
==================================================

fake size and using every
method at their disposal to
hide what they are really
doing. They also cause
traders to overtrade, which is
the number one way to get
out of this business in a
hurry. Traders will save
themselves a lot of
frustration simply by turning
this off. In sum, ignore the
marketing and ask other
traders who have been
actively slinging stocks and



==================================================
                     PAGE 771                     
==================================================

futures for at least five years.
How Can a Bad Execution
Platform Ruin My
Account?
In the late 1990s and early
2000s, it was all about faster
executions. A trader who had
an execution platform that
was faster than the others had
an edge. Online web-based
brokers caught on and started
offering “60-second



==================================================
                     PAGE 772                     
==================================================

guarantees” on fills. Those of
us who were using direct
access laughed in their faces.
Sixty seconds might as well
have been a week. Today,
nearly every broker has
adapted, and everybody has
lightning-fast executions. So
what platforms have the
edge?
Think back to what I said
about trader psychology in
Chapter 2. Most of the



==================================================
                     PAGE 773                     
==================================================

mistakes that traders make
are emotional. I’ve watched
traders get flustered,
especially in futures trading,
and make mistakes with their
orders. They go long five
contracts of the euro FX and
then make an error in trying
to place the stop that ends up
liquidating their position.
Other times, they put a target
in place and end up doubling
up on their position because
of a mechanical error. Or,



==================================================
                     PAGE 774                     
==================================================

worse, they don’t feel like
going through the entire
process of placing a stop,
then placing a target, and
then remembering to cancel
the remaining open order
once either the stop or the
target is hit—so they don’t
place a stop or a target.
These are the traders who
“rely on their judgment while
they’re in a trade” and create
great opportunities for the
rest of us when they



==================================================
                     PAGE 775                     
==================================================

inevitably freak out. Manual
order submission and trade
management is a tedious,
error-prone process. Coupled
with heightened emotions, it
is a recipe for trader blowout.
Maybe it won’t happen
today, and maybe not
tomorrow, but that day is
always lurking on the
horizon.
In addition, some traders
simply are not computer

                     PAGE 776                     
==================================================

savvy. They are not
comfortable on computers,
and it is easy for them to
fumble an order. The best
computer users are kids
(people in their twenties—I
now refer to them as kids),
and it’s because they have
grown up playing video
games on their PCs. Some
traders I know have
deliberately learned to play
“one-person shooter” games
on their PCs in order to



==================================================
                     PAGE 777                     
==================================================

improve their speed on the
keyboard. The most popular
of these is called Call of
Duty. This game places you
in various battles during
World War II, and it is
literally act fast or die—kind
of like trading. By the time
people get through this
adventure, their eye-hand-
mouse-keyboard
coordination will have
improved exponentially. My
trading partners and I have



==================================================
                     PAGE 778                     
==================================================

all gone through the game,
and it improved our hand-eye
coordination considerably.
This game is available at
stores like Best Buy for $30.
Since this book was first
published, multiple editions
have come out—just be
careful you don’t get so
hooked on the games that
you stop trading!

==================================================
                     PAGE 779                     
==================================================

to help traders protect
themselves from themselves.
Think of a typical trade.
Let’s say I go long 10
contracts of the E-mini S&P
500 futures (ES) at 1204.25.
I place a 2-point (8-tick)
stop, and I want to exit half
my position on a 1-point (4-
tick) move to 1205.25. For
the rest of my position, I will
trail my stop—every time the
ES moves 1 point (4 ticks), I
will move my stop up 1



==================================================
                     PAGE 780                     
==================================================

point. This requires active
trade management, with the
pressing of a lot of keys and
many mouse clicks. One
mistake and I can turn this
winning trade into a loser.
What if, each time I
bought the ES, my trading
execution platform knew that
I would be using a 2-point
stop and a 1-point target on
the first half of my position?
If it knew that, then it could



==================================================
                     PAGE 781                     
==================================================

place the orders for me
automatically, and I wouldn’t
have to do a thing. What if it
also knew that when my first
target was hit, I wanted to
bring my stop up to
breakeven? And what if it
also knew to change the
number of contracts in my
stop from 10 to 5 when the
first target was hit? What if it
also knew to then trail the
stop? What if I had a target,
and it knew to cancel my



==================================================
                     PAGE 782                     
==================================================

stop order once my target
was hit? And what if it did
all this automatically, so that
all I had to do was get into
the trade, and after that I
could essentially walk away
because the software was
managing the trade for me
according to my
specifications? The purpose
of my day would be to sit
back, relax, and focus on
finding high-probability
entries, instead of having to



==================================================
                     PAGE 783                     
==================================================

scramble around once I was
in the trade and actively
manage it—a process that
can be mentally straining and
cause many emotional
fluctuations.
That is the kind of
software that is available
today. All traders have to do
is wait and be patient for an
appropriate entry level, take
the entry, and then the
software can manage the



==================================================
                     PAGE 784                     
==================================================

trade for them according to
their own specifications. This
process removes a lot of the
mental stress involved in
trading and helps to prevent
traders from making the
common mistakes that ruin
many of them. This type of
functionality was not readily
available with many brokers
even in 2005, but as I’m
updating this today in 2011,
these are common features,
and additional improvements



==================================================
                     PAGE 785                     
==================================================

continue to catch on.
I’ve tried many of the
platforms that are available
today, and there are a few
standouts from the crowd.
However, it doesn’t take long
for a new version to emerge
and triumph over all its
rivals. There are some that
are great but add too many
fees. Others work fine but are
memory intensive and really
slow down a computer. The



==================================================
                     PAGE 786                     
==================================================

perfect one is fast, doesn’t
take up much memory, and
doesn’t tag on a lot of extra
fees. If you are interested in
the list of platforms I am
currently using, send an e-
mail to
support@tradethemarkets.com
or call our office. Let’s take a
look at a more or less generic
example of what I’m talking
about.
Figure 3.3 illustrates a



==================================================
                     PAGE 787                     
==================================================

shot of a “Strategy Manager”
window, where traders can
enter their predetermined
trade entry and exit points.
The Strategy Manager is
open, and the Position
Strategies tab is selected. The
strategy that is highlighted is
called TradeTheMarkets,
which is a strategy that I
created. In the position type
box (Pos Type), I have
selected the bottom choice
(Stop/3T). This means that



==================================================
                     PAGE 788                     
==================================================

this strategy will have three
profit targets and one stop
order. In other words, I can
buy six lots of the E-mini
S&Ps and scale out of my
position two lots at a time, at
predetermined exit points.
The details are entered in the
middle of the screen. For this
trade, when I get in long or
short, the software will
automatically place a 2-point
stop, and it will
automatically place orders so



==================================================
                     PAGE 789                     
==================================================

that I can scale out of two
contracts when I’m up 1
point, scale out of another
two contracts when I’m up 2
points, and scale out of the
final two contracts when I’m
up 3 points. In addition, once
I am out of my trade, the
open stop order is
automatically canceled.
This screen focuses on my
“target exit strategy.” My
“stop exit strategy” is



==================================================
                     PAGE 790

different, and you can see
that a stop strategy called
“JohnCarter” is selected.
(See Figure 3.4.)

Figure 3.4
The “Stop Strategies” tab
allows the trader to create a
single stop or a trailing stop.
The trailing stop will
automatically move based on
the parameters put into this
screen. As the various profit
targets are hit, the stop loss
will move up a specified
amount, ensuring that an
increasing portion of any

                     PAGE 795                     
==================================================

profits is protected.
Traders may have just one
setup that they use, or they
may have half a dozen or
more that they have created
over the years. Each setup
that a trader uses should have
a different set of rules for
exiting the trade. Some of the
setups may utilize a 3:1
risk/reward ratio (risking 1
point to make 3), while
others utilize a 1:2



==================================================
                     PAGE 796                     
==================================================

risk/reward ratio (risking 2
points to make 1). Some of
the setups may use trailing
stops and multiple targets,
and some may have
stationary stops and single
targets. All the various exit
and stop strategies can be
created for each setup on
each market in which it is
going to be utilized and
matched together. Once these
are all created, all traders
have to do is tell the software



==================================================
                     PAGE 797                     
==================================================

which setup they are about to
take, on which market, and
then focus on the entry level.
Once they enter the trade, the
software does the rest of the
often very tedious and error-
prone work. What is also
nice is that a trader can have
a couple of plays running
simultaneously in different
markets and not get frazzled
watching after all of them.
This type of technology
automatically brings



==================================================
                     PAGE 798                     
==================================================

discipline and focus into the
trader’s life and generally
makes the trading day
smoother and more
deliberate, leaving a trader
refreshed at the end of the
day instead of worn out.

==================================================

Figure 3.5
What is also nice is that,
once the trade is placed, all
these orders are easy to
follow and are marked
visually on a screen of the
market being traded.
In Figure 3.5, the screen
shows that an order was
filled for six contracts on the
E-mini S&Ps at 1188.00.
That is also where the market
is currently trading, so the



==================================================
                     PAGE 801                     
==================================================

P&L at the bottom of the
screen says 0.00, as there
isn’t a profit or a loss at the
moment. The total number of
contracts being traded is
displayed on the middle left
side, showing +6, since the
position is long. If I were
short here, it would have said
–6. At point 1, this is where I
can choose my initial stop (in
this case, 10 ticks) and then
how I want my stop to
change if targets are hit. In



==================================================
                     PAGE 802                     
==================================================

this case, if the first target is
hit at 1189.00, my stop will
automatically move from my
entry –10 ticks (see point 2)
to entry –4 ticks. In addition,
the stop quantity will
automatically change from 6
contracts to 4 contracts. If the
second target is hit at point 3,
at 1190.00, then my stop will
automatically move from –4
ticks to my entry point,
creating a “breakeven” stop
on the last part of my trade.



==================================================
                     PAGE 803                     
==================================================

This just means that while I
have booked gains on the
first two-thirds of my trade,
the worst I can do on the last
third is break even. Of
course, if my second target is
hit, my stop quantity also
changes automatically from 4
contracts to 2 contracts. The
“Flatten” button in the
middle left of the screen is
also very useful. This closes
out all open positions and
cancels all orders with the

                     PAGE 804                     
==================================================

click of a mouse. There are
other things that these
platforms can do, but this
should give you an idea of
what your software, at the
very least, should be capable
of doing for you.
Why Do Most Financial
Newsletters Suck?
This section isn’t about
recommending good

                     PAGE 805                     
==================================================

services that are available.
It’s about how to treat them.
There are many market-
related services, newsletters,
and Internet chat rooms that
are operating today. These
services typically offer
opinions on the markets, and
they usually charge a fee for
accessing their information.
They offer thoughts on
market direction and
sometimes specific market
picks. I used to be a



==================================================
                     PAGE 806                     
==================================================

newsletter junkie, and I still
am to some extent. However,
these days I’m much less
interested in individual
opinions and more interested
in websites that offer a quick
synopsis of the current state
of the markets through a
variety of technical data. To
that end, one of the best sites
on the Internet is Decision
Point, run by Carl Swenlin
(www.decisionpoint.com).
This site allows traders to get



==================================================
                     PAGE 807                     
==================================================

a quick feel for the markets
and offers an endless amount
of drilldown detail, which I
like to peruse on Sundays. In
addition to getting quick
readings on key numbers
such as NYSE (New York
Stock Exchange) Member
Net Buy/Sells, Investor
Sentiment, and key put/call
readings, traders can sort
sectors and markets by
relative strength and quickly
see where the next rallies and



==================================================
                     PAGE 808                     
==================================================

declines will emerge. I find
this tool priceless for gauging
market direction and for
seeing firsthand where the
big money is flowing. It’s the
best $20 a month ever spent.
I also like to read comments
by John Mauldin in his
weekly newsletter, Thoughts
from the Frontline
(www.2000wave.com). His
writing is lucid, far-reaching,
and entertaining.



==================================================
                     PAGE 809                     
==================================================

I also find it useful to read
and balance the views of the
people who think the Dow is
going to 3000 with the views
of the people who think the
Dow is going to 30,000.
There are both rational and
ridiculous arguments for both
cases. I personally don’t have
an opinion on where the
stock market is going to be
by March 27, 2023. I’m more
focused on what its range
over the next several months



==================================================
                     PAGE 810                     
==================================================

is going to be. Also, it is
important to take these views
with a grain of salt. With
Wall Street, if everyone is
expecting the same thing to
happen, then it’s not going to
happen. It is certainly
important to stay on top of
the major trends affecting the
world today, namely, an
aging population, the great
deleveraging process that is
taking place as a result of the
2008 financial crisis, and the



==================================================
                     PAGE 811                     
==================================================

explosive economic growth
of China and India. These are
real trends that affect nearly
everything in our lives.
Where there are trends, there
are opportunities to make
money.
The main thing to keep in
mind is that everyone is
offering an opinion,
especially if it’s regarding a
specific trade
recommendation. The writer



==================================================
                     PAGE 812                     
==================================================

may sound absolutely
convinced that this is the best
trade on the planet, and this
conviction can easily pass
into the brain of the reader.
The bottom line is this: first,
great conviction is in no way
correlated with a greater
chance of said
recommendation actually
happening. (Remember, even
newsletter writers would
rather be right than make
money.) Second, if traders



==================================================
                     PAGE 813                     
==================================================

take a recommendation from
a subscription service, they
still have to set appropriate
risk parameters and decide
how much they are willing to
lose on the pick. They also
must realize that it is just an
opinion—it doesn’t mean
that things are going to
unfold the way the writer
says. Just because a guru
thinks the market is going to
crash doesn’t mean that it is
going to crash. I’ve heard



==================================================
                     PAGE 814                     
==================================================

more stories about people
blowing out their accounts
because “they put it all on a
newsletter recommendation.”
There is a tendency for
traders to feel more confident
in a trade because it is being
recommended by somebody
else. A tip! In reality, it’s just
a trade setup like any other,
and it is important that a
trader not get lured in with a
false sense of security that
this particular trade is going



==================================================
                     PAGE 815                     
==================================================

to work out exactly as
planned. Whether traders
found a setup for themselves
or whether they are following
a trade setup recommended
in a newsletter, the ultimate
responsibility is the traders’.
Don’t get overconfident just
because you read about
something online.

First Two Hours of the
Trading Day, Why Is It
Your Fault?
I talk more about this at the
end of the book when I
discuss the business plan, but
it does touch a little on
technology here. The bottom
line is that a trader needs
focus and concentration in
order to be successful in this
business. The most critical
hours in the stock market are



==================================================
                     PAGE 817                     
==================================================

generally the first two hours
of the trading day. This is
where most of the setups
occur. It is up to a trader to
communicate to his
colleagues or, if he is trading
from home, to his spouse and
children that he cannot be
disturbed during this time.
When I am trading, I am not
checking e-mail, I am not
answering the phone, and I
am not accepting uninvited
visitors. If my wife wants to



==================================================
                     PAGE 818

be dropped off at the gym
before the trading day starts,
she knows the deadline. If
she lets me know after the
deadline, my answer is
always the same, “Honey,
you know I love you. The
trade is on.” Click. (I usually
remember flowers on those
days.)
It can be hard to
communicate things like this
directly. You’ll find it is



==================================================
                     PAGE 819                     
==================================================

helpful to write out a fully
developed trading plan and
then share it with the people
in your life. Once they
understand that this is
important to you and that you
are serious, they will
generally respect any
boundaries that are clearly
outlined in what they are
reading. Think of it from
their perspective. I know that
when my wife visits me at

anyone who doesn’t utilize
instant messaging software,
this is an incredibly efficient
way to stay in touch. People
can call at exactly the wrong
moments during a trade.
With instant messaging,
people can type in a question
and the trader can get back to
them at her leisure. Instant
messaging was built for
traders. This is free software,
and I used to utilize the three
most popular programs:



==================================================
                     PAGE 822                     
==================================================

MSN, Yahoo!, and AOL. I
now mostly use Skype and
the chat feature that comes
with Gmail (Google’s e-mail
service). The key with instant
messaging software,
however, is to block
everybody except for people
that the trader has
specifically permitted on her
list. If everyone knows you
are online, then everyone
will bug you. For traders,
instant messaging between

their brokers and other
traders is appropriate. It is
inappropriate from anyone
else who could interrupt a
trader’s workday, and this
includes family members and
clients. There are very few
people who are on my list,
but they are all important to
my trading day. My wife did
make the cut, however, and it
has proved to be a useful way
to stay in touch when the
markets are moving. It is

Why Is Watching Harry
Potter on DVD After 12
Noon Eastern Better Than
Watching CNBC?
I am bringing this up because
I’ve seen too many traders
who quit their jobs and
follow what I call the
“CNBC setup.” They are



==================================================
                     PAGE 825                     
==================================================

excited because they are
finally able to trade full-time.
They feel they’ve been at a
disadvantage all these years,
getting quotes from the
Internet, sneaking trades onto
their computers in between
meetings, and hearing about
key news events only after
the markets have already
closed. So what do they do?
They plop a TV down right
next to their computers, turn
on CNBC, and glue

==================================================

themselves to the screen,
looking for trading
opportunities.
CNBC has a very specific
job: to provide viewers with
enough entertainment so that
they tune in and watch.
When a lot of people are
watching, the network makes
more money from the
commercials. It’s as simple
as that. CNBC is fun to
watch, and when things get



==================================================
                     PAGE 827                     
==================================================

serious, it does a great job of
reporting. I found out about
9/11 as it unfolded live
before my eyes from Mark
Haines. I flipped to some of
the other channels, but I
ended up parking it on
CNBC that day because it
did, hands down, the best job
of reporting about it. Who
can forget Maria Bartiromo
reporting about the event,
covered in ash and soot just
after the first building

                     PAGE 828                     
==================================================

collapsed? It was a gut-
wrenching experience to
watch, and the reporters and
the network did a great job.
That said, traders must
realize that they cannot make
a living “trading the news”
off any financial news
channel. By the time
something appears on
television, it is way too late
to react. Trading floors have
already heard the news, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 829                     
==================================================

by the time it makes it to the
public, the floor traders are
closing their positions,
ideally to suckers who just
saw the headlines. If
anything, CNBC can be used
as a fading tool—taking the
opposite side of the news.
Once it runs out of stories
and starts repeating the same
things over and over, I turn
down the volume and either
turn on a commercial-free
music radio station or, once

in a while, plop in a DVD.
Who can get tired of
watching Gladiator?
Traders who do this for a
living spend their days
waiting for specific setups to
take shape. Yet one of the
biggest weaknesses of most
traders is a need to be in
every move. If the markets
start running away, many
traders just can’t help but
jump in, fearing that they



==================================================
                     PAGE 831                     
==================================================

may be missing something
big. This is a fatal flaw that
will ruin any trader who
can’t control this habit. If
there is anything I can
hammer into your brain as
you are reading this book, it
is this: it is okay to miss
moves. Professional traders
miss moves; amateur traders
try to chase every move. By
listening to music or keeping
a DVD on in the background,
traders have something they



==================================================
                     PAGE 832                     
==================================================

can use to pass the time
while they wait for their
specific setup to take shape.
This makes them less prone
to jump impulsively into
trades just because they are
bored or because they can’t
stand missing out on a move.
The goal is not to catch every
move in the market. The goal
is to take the specific setups
that you have outlined as a
part of your business plan.
Otherwise you are just a

G P
REEK ROVERB
The World Beyond Stocks:
Why Is It Important?
We’ve covered why markets
move, how traders sabotage
themselves, and what to do
with your computer. That
was the equivalent of prep
school. It’s time for you to
graduate and start looking at



==================================================
                     PAGE 836                     
==================================================

the markets. Deciding what
markets to trade is critically
important. The reality is,
some markets offer much
better opportunities than
others. Where would you
rather open up a hot-dog
stand—inside Yankee
Stadium or at the side of a
dirt road in the middle of
Nebraska?
I wrote this chapter
specifically for stock traders



==================================================
                     PAGE 837                     
==================================================

who have never ventured
beyond those borders into the
world of futures contracts,
which include stock indexes,
currencies, interest rates,
gold, oil, grains, and a
variety of other asset classes.
My goal is to provide a
straightforward guide to
these markets from a trader’s
perspective. I’m not going to
go into a dissertation on
contract specifications or all
the other mechanics of these



==================================================
                     PAGE 838                     
==================================================

contracts. This information is
readily available at
www.cmegroup.com. I’m
just going to focus on the
mechanics of buying or
selling these contracts from a
trader’s perspective, and the
key things to know if you do
decide to give them a try. I
also am not going to try to
talk a person into trading
these markets—more
individual traders get eaten
for lunch in these markets



==================================================
                     PAGE 839                     
==================================================

than anywhere else. Why?
Because they jump right in
without understanding the
leverage involved and end up
trading way too many
contracts for their account
size. We already know what
happens to a trader who is
not psychologically ready to
do this for a living. Add
leverage to that equation, and
a trader is behind the eight
ball from the get-go. That
said, futures are great once



==================================================
                     PAGE 840                     
==================================================

you understand them. They
provide 24-hour access to all
the major asset classes in the
world, they are great for day
trading or longer-term trades,
and there is always
something that is moving.
That is, if the stock market is
having a quiet week, a trader
can always check out what is
happening in the gold
market.
I also will not attempt to



==================================================
                     PAGE 841                     
==================================================

discuss how all these markets
interact with and influence
one another on a global level
(although I will hit upon
some of the basics). That
would involve a macro
discussion of how the world
works, and it is not within
the scope of this book. I just
want to show you how I trade
them for a living. Ultimately,
if you decide not to trade
them, that is completely fine.
At least you’ll know how



==================================================
                     PAGE 842                     
==================================================

they work, how they affect
the stock market, and even
how to use them to time your
stock picks.
For traders who are
already familiar with these
markets, feel free to skim
through this chapter and
move on to the next—
although I would read both
the next section and the part
that compares trading the
mini-sized Dow (YM) to



==================================================
                     PAGE 843                     
==================================================

trading the E-mini S&Ps
(ES).
Although I say in the
introduction that I won’t be
focusing on basic trading
terminology such as
uptrends, I do want to
explain the other markets
outside of stocks that I refer
to in this book. The reason
for this is that most traders
I’ve met are stock traders
only. Some might have a



==================================================
                     PAGE 844                     
==================================================

little experience with the E-
mini futures, but for the most
part, their focus is on actual
stocks and that’s it. To put
this in perspective, there are
roughly 25 million stock
brokerage accounts in the
United States. When I wrote
this book in 2005, there were
only about 450,000 futures
accounts. However, that
number has grown
exponentially as large
brokers such as TD



==================================================
                     PAGE 845                     
==================================================

Ameritrade have embraced
futures trading. For people
who are familiar only with
stocks, contracts such as the
30-year bond, soybeans,
S&Ps, euros, and gold often
seem nebulous, scary, and
out of reach. But are they
really? Not really, and they
provide a lot of flexibility
that can’t be found in stocks
alone.
Figure 4.1 shows a very



==================================================
                     PAGE 846                     
==================================================

good reason for knowing
how all these various markets
work, and that reason is as
follows: there are always
going to be some markets
that are trending and some
that are stuck in a trading
range. Some are going to be
moving higher while others
are moving lower. While
Figure 4.1 shows uptrending
gold and 10-year note
markets, the S&P 500 is
forming a double top, and the



==================================================
                     PAGE 847                     
==================================================

euro currency is range-
bound. Although Figure 4.1
is based on a weekly time
frame, this same kind of
thing happens on all intraday
time frames as well. While
one market is chopping,
another market is trending. I
have setups for both types of
markets that I review later in
this book.
Markets Are a Reflection of
the People Who Trade

==================================================

Them: Is Your Competition
Wired on Starbucks or
Methodically Filling In a
Crossword Puzzle?
In addition to traders
exposing themselves to a
wider variety of potentially
trending markets, it’s
important to at least
understand how these other
markets work for three
reasons. First, these other
markets affect stock prices.



==================================================
                     PAGE 849                     
==================================================

A lasting rally in bonds can
force large funds to start
buying stocks in order to
readjust their allocations. A
surge in oil prices can place
downward pressure on
stocks. Rising lumber and
steel costs can hurt some
companies’ earnings but help
others. Second, there are
going to be times when the
stock market is dead in the
water, and these other
markets will provide



==================================================
                     PAGE 850                     
==================================================

opportunities for traders to
continue making a living.
Third, each market has its
own personality. Traders
who have been exposed only
to stocks are betting it all that
this is the market that best
suits their personality. There
may be another one out there
that fits like a glove, so to
speak, which makes the
traders’ job that much easier.
For example, the ES (E-mini
S&P 500) isn’t that great to



==================================================
                     PAGE 851                     
==================================================

trade if you are looking for
momentum-type moves. For
momentum moves, it’s better
to look to GC (gold), EC
(euros), and S (soybeans).

==================================================

Figure 4.1
In the end, all charts and
all markets are the same.
They always have been, and
they always will be, because
all chart patterns depict the
same thing—emotional
reactions and decisions made
by human beings. Even if it
is a mechanical system that is
making the trades, it was still
written by a human. A trader
is always trading with other



==================================================
                     PAGE 854                     
==================================================

traders, no matter what the
market.
Yet each market is made
up of different types of
traders. What are these
traders like? If they are S&P
traders, then it’s possible that
they are wired on Starbucks
and are super-aggressive. If
they are trading bonds, it’s
possible that they are
methodically filling in a
crossword puzzle in between



==================================================
                     PAGE 855                     
==================================================

trades. If they are trading
corn, it is possible that they
are napping at their desk, as
they are more concerned with
hedging a cash crop. Which
type of trader would you
rather trade against?
Compete against? One of the
key differences between
most successful traders and
unsuccessful traders is this:
successful traders are in
markets where their
personalities shine.



==================================================
                     PAGE 856                     
==================================================

A stark example of this
can be found in a friend of
mine who trades 10-year
notes. He routinely makes
just over seven figures a year
trading this market. A few
years ago, he got bored and
decided to start trading the
S&Ps. He liked the
excitement and the action,
and he wanted to be a part of
that game. The result? It was
a struggle from the first
trade, and he lost hundreds of



==================================================
                     PAGE 857                     
==================================================

thousands of dollars. Licking
his wounds, he went back to
trading 10-year notes—and
making just over seven
figures a year. Boring is not
necessarily a bad thing. I
can’t emphasize enough the
importance of trading the
right market for your
personality.
Also keep in mind that
many firms realize that there
are many newer traders out



==================================================
                     PAGE 858                     
==================================================

there who are buying the
latest software packages in
order to “beat the markets.”
These firms buy the same
software and use it to trade
against the newbies. This is
in addition to these firms
having a full-time research
staff and access to tons of
information. These types of
firms usually focus on the
S&P futures. Are you
prepared to trade against
these guys in the S&Ps and



==================================================
                     PAGE 859                     
==================================================

make a living off their
occasional mistakes and bad
judgment?
I started off as a stocks
and options trader. I liked
these markets, did well in
these markets, and continue
to trade in these markets.
However, I was always
curious about the other
markets that were available.
For a long time I didn’t do
much about this curiosity.



==================================================
                     PAGE 860                     
==================================================

Why? Frankly, the futures
markets seemed scary. Yet I
really just wanted to see how
these other markets worked
and at least to see how I
would do trading them.
Maybe I would find
something I liked better than
stocks. However, I felt that
futures and foreign exchange
currency trading (forex) were
suited only to traders sitting
behind a desk at a large bank
or institutional trading firm,



==================================================
                     PAGE 861                     
==================================================

so it took me a while to
finally venture into these
markets. This isn’t so much
the case today because these
markets have become more
accessible. Ironically,
however, some of these same
institutional traders now visit
me at my offices to learn the
various trade setups I utilize
in these markets. They had
no problem trading these
instruments with the firm’s
money, but when they left to



==================================================
                     PAGE 862                     
==================================================

try it with their own money,
the psychological factors
kicked in, and they struggled.
I eventually worked with
some traders in these markets
in the mid-1990s, and they
helped to strip away the
myths, showing me how
these markets worked and
how to reduce risk and create
solid trading opportunities. In
my search to understand the
futures and forex markets, I



==================================================
                     PAGE 863                     
==================================================

had to pull bits and pieces
together from different
sources over the course of
several months before I
finally understood how all
these trading instruments
worked. Most of the
information was elusive at
best— a more apt description
would be worthless. I never
was able to find a consistent,
easy-to-understand summary
that told me everything I
needed to know about trading



==================================================
                     PAGE 864                     
==================================================

these instruments, and this
process was frankly
frustrating and annoying. As
a trader, I just wanted to
know the basics—how do I
trade them, how much
money do I need to trade
them, and how does the price
movement affect my P&L?
I’ll use the rest of this
chapter to create the
summary information I wish
I’d had then. In the end, I’m
glad I tried out these other



==================================================
                     PAGE 865                     
==================================================

markets, as it is these other
markets that allowed me to
make the jump to trading
full-time for a living.
Why Should Traders Learn
About the Futures
Markets?
Think of this as a quick blurb
designed to help a trader
better understand the futures
markets. This account is by
no means comprehensive—



==================================================
                     PAGE 866                     
==================================================

there are entire books written
on the subject. However, to
an individual who has traded
only stocks, the futures
markets are probably a
mystery, and maybe even a
little menacing. Yet traders
who have already learned the
importance of strict money
management will appreciate
what futures trading has to
offer. Typically, once people
try trading futures, they
simply stop trading stocks.



==================================================
                     PAGE 867                     
==================================================

The ease of entry on both the
long and the short sides, the
ability to focus on a few
markets instead of hundreds
of stocks, and the lack of
market-maker games make
them a refreshing change
from the world of stocks.
Let’s begin.
First off, there are many
types of futures contracts. A
person can trade anything
from copper to coffee, from



==================================================
                     PAGE 868                     
==================================================

stock indexes to silver, or
from pork bellies to
palladium. It’s not important
to worry about most of these
contracts in the beginning,
but it is important to
understand a core group of
them and how they work. I
know many traders who
focus on only one of these
contracts and are doing quite
well. However, it took them
time to find the right market
and the right setup within



==================================================
                     PAGE 869                     
==================================================

that market that was best
suited to their personality.
This can often be a long and
perilous journey, but once
they found the right fit, they
never looked back. These are
the main futures markets that
I follow and trade outside of
stocks:

• Various single-stock

in the book as SSFs)

==================================================

are mini and some are full-
sized, although that can be a
misnomer. For example,
trading the E-mini S&P ES
contract has about the same
specs as trading the full-sized
corn contract. This is why, as
a trader, the most important
thing is to get an idea of the
daily range of these markets,
and what that means for your
P&L. In other words, what is
a tick worth in each contract?
What about a full point?

Figure 4.2 shows a move
in the full-sized 100-ounce
gold contract (GC). As it
states, this contract
represents 100 ounces of
gold. The trading dome
shows a purchase price at
$1,650.20 per ounce. The
contract is currently trading
at $1,651.70 per ounce, a
gain of 15 “ticks” (ticks are
the smallest price increment
in which a futures market
moves). A move from



==================================================
                     PAGE 874                     
==================================================

$1,650.20 to $1,650.30 (1
tick, which in this case is 10
cents) is worth $10.00 on 100
ounces of gold. This move of
15 ticks ($1.50) on 1 contract
shows a gain of $150.00. If
I’d had 10 contracts, then the
gain would be $1,500.00, and
so on. There are two things
to be gained from this. First,
the move on 1 contract isn’t
actually that scary—$10.00
per tick is manageable.
Second, buying and selling a



==================================================
                     PAGE 875

futures contract is just like
buying and selling a stock.

everything is available today

To get charts on these,
traders will have to instruct
their quote vendor that they

Dow, bonds, 10-year notes,
and grains), the CME
(Chicago Mercantile
Exchange) (for the E-mini
S&P, E-mini Nasdaq, and
currencies), and the NYMEX
(New York Mercantile
Exchange) if they want
quotes on oil and gold. There
is an “E-mini only” quote
feed that is cheaper, but a
trader will want the full

cost around $80 a month for
full versions of both the
CME and the CBOT. And it
should be noted here that all
of this is available for free on
the thinkorswim trading
platform, as well as a few
other platforms
One thing that throws
newer traders off is that
futures trade in contracts

months. The stock index and
currency futures trade
quarterly: March, June,
September, and December. If
it’s May 7, then you’ll be
trading the closest month out,
which in this case is the June
contract (letter code M), also
called the “front month.” In
June, this contract will stop
trading, and the new “front
month” will be September
(letter code U). Figure 4.3
shows the letter code for

each of the contract months.
The stock index and currency
futures months have been
highlighted. Other contracts,
such as soybeans, oil, and
gold, trade a little differently
with regard to contract
months. If you are ever
unsure, just go to
www.cmegroup.com and
look up the contract
specifications, or, better yet,
just ask your broker.

==================================================

In a Nutshell, What Do
Traders Really Need to
Know?
When traders buy a futures
contract, they are not
physically buying anything.
This is simply a way of
participating in the price
movement of the market of
their choice. If they think a
market is going to move 10
points, they can buy a futures
contract, long or short, and



==================================================
                     PAGE 883                     
==================================================

make money on the move if
it goes in their direction.
Obviously, they can also lose
money on the move if it goes
against them. Also, if they
own a stock index futures
contract that expires, they are
not going to get a bunch of
stock certificates dumped on
their doorstep. The expired
contract will be converted to
cash, and they will see the
cash deposited in their
account. Other contracts, like



==================================================
                     PAGE 884                     
==================================================

soybeans, are “deliverables,”
meaning that a person can be
the proud owner of 5,000
bushels of soybeans per
contract upon expiration. Is
this really a worry? Brokers
never like it when a contract
expires in a trader’s account.
They will call and badger a
trader to get him to close it
out, so there is little danger
of his forgetting. And if they
can’t get you on the phone,
they typically will simply



==================================================
                     PAGE 885                     
==================================================

close it out for you. They just
don’t want to have to deal
with an actual delivery. If for
some reason it still happens,
you won’t have a truckload
of soybeans dumped on your
doorstep. It’s all handled on
the brokerage end, and
people there can get the
account back to normal.



==================================================
                     PAGE 886                     
==================================================

Figure 4.3
For price movement, if a
trader has one contract in the
E-mini S&P futures, for



==================================================
                     PAGE 887                     
==================================================

example, and it moves 1
point (for example, from
1,032.75 to 1,033.75), that
translates into $50 on her
P&L. For the Nasdaq, a 1-
point move equates to $20.
For the mini-sized Dow, a 1-
point move is $5. Therefore,
if a trader buys three E-mini
S&Ps and catches a 2-point
move, that is $50 times 2
points times 3 contracts, or
$300. There is leverage here,
indeed, but it is more



==================================================
                     PAGE 888                     
==================================================

manageable than most people
think. Where traders get in
trouble is when they trade
too many contracts in
relation to their account size,
something I talk more about
later. By the way, when the
S&P moves a point, the Dow
moves roughly 10 points, so
these two contracts are nearly
identical to trade. If traders
say that they just made 50
points in the YM (mini-sized
Dow), that is just like making



==================================================
                     PAGE 889                     
==================================================

5 points in the ES (E-mini
S&Ps).
Figure 4.4 shows a mini-
sized Dow trade with 10
contracts. The chart reflects a
27-point move, which is
worth $1,350 to a trader’s
P&L. I summarize all these
contract specifications for
bonds, euros, soybeans, and
so on, at the end of this
chapter. Of course, these
price fluctuations go both

==================================================

ways, so money management
is the absolute key to trading
futures. It is imperative that
traders know their stop
before they enter a trade, and
that they stick to it and not
play any psychological
games. In futures, as in
stocks, hoping and praying
can, and do, lead to ruin.
However, the nice thing
about futures is that they are
so quick and the fills so clean
that a trader can get stopped



==================================================
                     PAGE 891                     
==================================================

out, and then a few moments
later get right back in. A
trader can’t be afraid to take
small losses, period. Reentry
is only a commission away.

Figure 4.4
In addition, electronic
contracts were set up
specifically for traders: they
are super liquid, and fills are
instantaneous. There are no
market-maker games such as
those that happen daily with
individual stocks. And with
electronic contracts, a trader
is out of the pit, where
outsiders can sometimes be



==================================================
                     PAGE 894                     
==================================================

treated little better than a
cockroach. Here are a few
other things I like about
futures:
• If traders think the
market is going to break
out, they can buy a stock
like INTC (Intel Corp.)
and watch it sit there
while the market roars
on without them. They
were right about the
market—but their stock



==================================================
                     PAGE 895                     
==================================================

pick didn’t move with
the market. With the
stock index futures, a
person is trading the
market instead of
watching the market. It
is what it is.
• A trader can short on a
downtick—this makes a
huge difference in trying
to get filled during a
breakdown. If traders try
to short the stock KLAC



==================================================
                     PAGE 896                     
==================================================

(KLAT-encor Corp.) “at
the market” on a
breakdown, they may
not get filled for 20 cents
until it has an uptick. If
they short the futures “at
the market” on a
breakdown, they get a
quick fill at the current
market price. Recently
this is becoming less of
an issue, as the
exchanges continue to
see the wisdom of



==================================================
                     PAGE 897                     
==================================================

allowing more and more
stocks to be shorted on
downticks.
• I used to be a big trader
of OEX (S&P 100
Index) options for day
trades. After trading
futures, I stopped trading
OEX options. The
spreads and premium of
OEX options now look
ridiculous. Where else
can a person be dead



==================================================
                     PAGE 898                     
==================================================

right on an intraday
move and still lose
money? The OEX
options market!
Although I do use OEX
options (or, more likely,
SPY options) for swing
trading, I wouldn’t day-
trade them with my
mother-in-law’s trading
account. Not when the
mini-sized Dow and the
E-mini S&P futures are
so clean and efficient.



==================================================
                     PAGE 899                     
==================================================

• A person can do most of
his trades “at the
market” and get good
fills, unlike stocks and
especially unlike
options.
• For stocks, a person
needs $25,000 to day-
trade. For futures, a
trader can open an
account with $5,000 (or
less) and day-trade.
There are no day-trading

                     PAGE 900                     
==================================================

rules or classifications.
That said, I recommend
that people start with a
larger-sized trading
account, but I also
realize that everyone has
to start somewhere. My
first trading account was
$2,000. Can people quit
their job, open up a
futures account with
$5,000, and trade for a
living? Absolutely …
not. I talk more about



==================================================
                     PAGE 901                     
==================================================

this later.
To buy one of the futures
contracts discussed in this
book as a day trade, under
day-trading margin, traders
generally need about $2,000
in their account. This varies
by broker and can be lower,
but this is an average. This
money is called margin, and
a trader can think of it as
making a 4 percent down
payment on a $50,000 house.



==================================================
                     PAGE 902                     
==================================================

By making the down
payment, the trader controls
the house, so to speak, and
she benefits from any price
increase and loses on any
price decrease on the house
itself. So if a trader has a
$10,000 account, she can buy
five mini-sized Dow
contracts (five $50,000
houses) and sometimes more
by utilizing lower intraday
margin rates. However, for
money management



==================================================
                     PAGE 903                     
==================================================

purposes, I heartily
recommend that you give
some thought to how many
contracts you are trading in
an account. This is a critical
part of your trading plan, and
it is something that I discuss
in more detail at the end of
the book. You can certainly
choose to trade five contracts
in a $10,000 account. You
can also choose to visit India
without getting any shots in
advance— but that doesn’t



==================================================
                     PAGE 904                     
==================================================

mean it’s a good idea. (My
Internet guru, Priyanka, is
from India, and she keeps
daring me to eat at a roadside
food stand next time I visit.)
I typically trade one
contract for every $10,000 to
$15,000 that is in my
account. This way, the
account swings will not be as
severe, and I can trade with a
level head. One trader friend
of mine trades one contract



==================================================
                     PAGE 905                     
==================================================

for every $50,000 in his
account. He makes money
and is never stressed out.
Conversely, I’ve seen
programs that say that a
trader should take a $5,000
account and trade five
contracts, and by doing this,
she can make six figures a
year. This is insane; the
trader would be better off
donating that $5,000 to
charity, because she will lose
it all if she trades that way.



==================================================
                     PAGE 906                     
==================================================

There are few guarantees in
the futures industry, but
losing all of your money if
you trade with this much
“maxed out” margin is the
one sure bet available today.
Here are some other key
points about futures:
• There are also now
futures available on
stocks. Called single-
stock futures, they are
great to use as swing



==================================================
                     PAGE 907                     
==================================================

trades in combination
with index futures.
Although some of the
symbols have low actual
volume, the “real
volume” is based on that
of the underlying stock.
(I talk more about
single-stock futures in
the chapter on
propulsion plays.)
• With futures, at the end
of the year, traders don’t



==================================================
                     PAGE 908                     
==================================================

have to list each
individual futures trade
for their tax return the
way they would have to
do with stocks. They get
a 1099 form from their
broker with their total
profit or loss for the
year. All they have to
put on their tax return is
the number that’s on the
1099. That is much
easier and much less
time-consuming than



==================================================
                     PAGE 909                     
==================================================

listing every trade. Tax
treatment is also
favorable. For stocks, a
trader has to hold them
for more than a year to
get classified at the
cheaper “long-term
gain” rate. For futures, a
trader gets a 1099 that
says, for example, that
he had $20,000 in gains
for the year. Of this, 60
percent of the money is
treated as long-term



==================================================
                     PAGE 910                     
==================================================

gains (lower tax rate),
and 40 percent is taxed
at the short-term rate.
This is the 60/40 rule.
This rule holds true even
if you go flat at the end
of every trading day.
This applies to all
futures contracts except
single-stock futures,
which are treated as
stocks in this regard.
• It is possible to trade



==================================================
                     PAGE 911                     
==================================================

futures in an IRA or
retirement account
through a trust company.
I don’t recommend this
unless traders have
already developed a
proven track record in
their own speculative
accounts. And if this is
the case, I recommend
that they then allocate no
more than 15 percent of
any retirement funds to
these vehicles. Traders



==================================================
                     PAGE 912                     
==================================================

have no business starting
out in futures using their
retirement funds. This is
like deliberately
choosing to go into
battle without a
bulletproof vest, or, for
that matter, a weapon.
As already discussed,
each stock index futures
vehicle has four contracts
that are traded each year:
March (H), June (M),



==================================================
                     PAGE 913                     
==================================================

September (U), and
December (Z). A trader will
want to trade the closest
month, because that is where
the volume is concentrated.
For example, if today is
February 15, 2012, then the
closest month is the March
2012 contract. To get a quote
for the March 2012 contract
on the E-mini S&P (ES), a
trader would enter the
symbol, month, and year. In
this case, that would be ES



==================================================
                     PAGE 914                     
==================================================

(symbol), H (month =
March), 12 (year = 2012).
The full symbol would be
ESH12. This is for
TradeStation. For eSignal, it
would be ES H2. For
thinkorswim, it’s/ESH2.
Each quote service is a little
different. When one contract
expires, just start trading the
next contract out. The four
times a year that the
contracts expire are always a
little choppy as traders make



==================================================
                     PAGE 915                     
==================================================

the transition from one
contract to the next.
Just remember that
although the E-mini futures
expire the same day as
options expiration, on the
third Friday of the month
they are being traded in, the
volume actually jumps into
the next contract month on
Thursday of the preceding
week. For example, in March
2011, options and futures



==================================================
                     PAGE 916                     
==================================================

expiration was on the third
Friday, which was March 18.
The volume jumped into the
June stock index futures
contracts on Thursday,
March 10. Bonds actually
switch three weeks early.
Each contract is a little
different. If traders aren’t
sure, they just need to ask
their broker, write it down,
and put it next to their PC.
Also, because these are
futures contracts, there is



==================================================
                     PAGE 917                     
==================================================

always a price difference
between two contracts. When
the March 2011 contract says
11,686 for the mini-sized
Dow, the June contract may
say something like 11,698. A
trader shouldn’t be confused
by this too much. Futures
contracts really are based on
“future prices,” which
accounts for the difference.
Just remember that each
contract is its own entity. It’s
possible to wake up on



==================================================
                     PAGE 918                     
==================================================

rollover day and see that the
S&P futures are up +8.00
points, when in actuality they
haven’t moved. It’s just that
the new contract month is
being quoted, since the new
June contract was trading
higher than the old March
contract. Most quote systems
get a little confused by this.
They end the day with the
closing price of the old
contract, then start the next
day with the opening price of



==================================================
                     PAGE 919                     
==================================================

the new contract, and voilà, a
price gap is created on the
charts.
Also note that there is
usually a 10- to 20-point
difference between the mini-
sized Dow futures price and
the Dow Jones Industrials
cash price on any given day.
There is a very complicated
explanation for this,
involving “basis,” “future
price projections,” and so on,



==================================================
                     PAGE 920                     
==================================================

that is not really important to
the short-term trader. It’s just
something to be aware of so
that traders don’t think
something is wrong with
their quote systems.
That sums up the basics
with regard to the mechanics
of trading futures. The key is
just to get comfortable with a
futures execution platform
and how it works. Buying a
mini-sized Dow contract is



==================================================
                     PAGE 921                     
==================================================

just like buying IBM
(International Business
Machines) or GOOG
(Google) in terms of
mechanics. I also recommend
starting off trading one lot at
a time. A new futures trader
will make mistakes, and a
mistake on one lot is much
cheaper than a mistake on ten
lots or more. A trader who
has never used a futures
broker before should talk
with other traders to check

The Mini-Sized Dow Versus
the E-Mini S&P 500: Does
It Matter?
Now that we have covered
Futures 101, I’d like to
review some of the basic
differences between the



==================================================
                     PAGE 923                     
==================================================

mini-sized Dow and the E-
mini S&P. I’m focusing on
these two contracts because,
in my experience, these are
going to be the contracts that
most of the people who are
reading this either currently
trade or will consider trading.
I trade both contracts
actively, but the mini-sized
Dow has a few advantages
over the E-mini S&P that I
want to point out. This
applies even more for newer



==================================================
                     PAGE 924                     
==================================================

traders.
Why Is It Important to
Understand the Difference
Between the Various Stock
Index Futures Contracts?
The mini-sized Dow (YM)
has the same specifications
as the popular E-mini S&P
(ES) contract:
• One point in the E-mini
S&P equals about ten



==================================================
                     PAGE 925                     
==================================================

points in the mini-sized
Dow.
• One point in the E-mini
S&P equals $50; ten
points in the mini-sized
Dow equals $50.
Figure 4.5 shows
movement on the Dow and
the S&P over exactly the
same time frame. The Dow
has moved 13 points lower
(from the high at point 1 to



==================================================
                     PAGE 926                     
==================================================

the low at point 2), and
during this same time, the
S&P has moved 1.5 points
lower. The Dow moved
lower in 13 one-point
increments. However, the
S&P made a similar move in
six quarter-point increments.
To break this down more
simply, when the Dow
moves 10 points, it does so in
10 one-point increments.
When the S&P moves an
equivalent one point, it does



==================================================
                     PAGE 927                     
==================================================

so in four quarter-point
increments. This is a 60
percent difference in the
spread. People who are
trading the YM over the ES
are putting that spread
differential right into their
pocket. Commissions and
spreads are a cost of doing
business, and anything that
can be done to reduce costs
will improve a trader’s
bottom line.



==================================================
                     PAGE 928                     
==================================================





==================================================
                     PAGE 929                     
==================================================

Figure 4.5
Another interesting
phenomenon is that nearly all
setups on the ES also can be
executed identically on the
YM. In fact, I often watch
the ES for trade setups, and
then take them on the YM.
However, by using the YM
instead of the ES on these
setups, a trader will get
picked off on stop runs less
frequently. Why is this? It



==================================================
                     PAGE 930                     
==================================================

goes back to the spread. A 2-
point stop on the ES is the
same as a 20-point stop on
the YM. There are many
times when the ES will run 2
points on a stop run, and this
moves the YM 18 or 19
points, missing the stop. The
YM has 12 extra places to
place a stop or target over the
ES in a 20-point move.
Because of this, I prefer to do
my pivot trades almost
exclusively in the YM.



==================================================
                     PAGE 931                     
==================================================

When Is Liquidity King?
When the mini-sized Dow
first came out, it was trading
very little volume. However,
the contract caught on fast,
and today it trades volume in
six figures nearly every day.
The ES is still the big boy
when it comes to volume,
trading millions of contracts
per day. This is something
that some traders need to
consider. If you are trading 1



==================================================
                     PAGE 932                     
==================================================

lot at a time, or even up to 10
lots, then the YM is fine. But
if you are trading a larger
account and are using 40 or
50 contracts, then you’ll
want to trade in the ES,
where there is greater
liquidity. The reality for me
is, though I would love to do
more trades in the YM, I am
mostly limited to the ES
when trading stock index
futures because of liquidity.
That said, I will typically



==================================================
                     PAGE 933                     
==================================================

“spread the love” across
multiple contracts. If I see a
solid setup taking shape as a
day trade, where I plan to
allocate a total of 50
contracts, I might buy 40 ES
and 10 YM. Finally, if you
do become an active stock
index futures trader,
seriously consider getting a
seat lease through the CME
Group. There is one for the
YM called an “IDEM” and
one for the ES called an



==================================================
                     PAGE 934                     
==================================================

“IOM.” These will reduce
your exchange fees by about
80 percent, thus reducing
your costs. For the YM, a
seat lease is currently around
$75 per month, and for the
ES, it’s around $550 a month
as of September 2011. These
prices can fluctuate based on
the amount of volume being
traded. There is a healthy
application fee of around
$1,500.00 for each of these.
If you trade around 2 YM



==================================================
                     PAGE 935                     
==================================================

contracts per day or 20 ES
contracts per day, then the
lease is a “breakeven”
venture. If you make any
more trades than that, you
start saving money. If you

Resistance?
A trader can watch the 30
stocks in the Dow to get a
very good idea of how the
index is acting or is going to
act. I like to place all 30 Dow
stocks in a window and have
them automatically sorted
from strongest to weakest
each day on a Net % Change
basis. Getting a feel for all
500 stocks in the S&P 500 at
a glance is impossible. By



==================================================
                     PAGE 937                     
==================================================

doing this with the Dow, I
can look at my sorter list and
see at a glance that, for
example, 26 out of the 30
stocks are red (down on the
day).
Figure 4.6 shows all 30
Dow stocks sorted from best
to worst on a Net % Change
basis. I can watch the list and
see that at this moment in
time, 7 stocks are down on
the day, while 23 stocks are



==================================================
                     PAGE 938                     
==================================================

up on the day. Later in the
day, I might see that 11 are
up on the day and that 19 are
down, and I can tell at a
glance that the Dow is
getting stronger—even if the
index is still chopping
around. If the individual
components of the Dow are
getting stronger, the entire
index will eventually make a
run higher. This filter gives
me a clean downward or
upward bias to the market, as



==================================================
                     PAGE 939                     
==================================================

I can watch more stocks
going red or going green as
the markets start to fall apart
or try to improve. This type
of “at a glance” analysis is
very difficult to do with the
500 stocks that make up the
S&P 500 index.
Also, with the Dow
components, it is easy to see
which ones have more
weight. If IBM (International
Business Machines), CVX



==================================================
                     PAGE 940                     
==================================================

(Chevron), and MCD
(McDonald’s) are all down
on the day, this is going to
have more of an impact on
the Dow than if BAC (Bank
of America), AA (Alcoa),
and GE (General Electric)
were all down on the day.
Figure 4.7 shows a listing
of all of the Dow stocks and
the current percentage
weighting each has within
the index. Again, this would



==================================================
                     PAGE 941                     
==================================================

be very difficult to do with
all 500 stocks of the S&P
500.
Why Are Futures Easier to
Trade Than Stocks?
If traders currently are in an
individual stock, there can be
all kinds of outside
influences that can move the
price. Maybe insiders are
dumping their own stock.
Maybe an analyst has just



==================================================
                     PAGE 942                     
==================================================

issued an upgrade while the
analyst’s trading department
is dumping shares on an
unsuspecting public. Maybe
the company is giving
positive forward guidance as
its last hope to stave off
bankruptcy proceedings. The
factors affecting an
individual stock are endless.



==================================================
                     PAGE 943

==================================================

Figure 4.6
However, when investors
in general want to sell stocks,
the Dow reacts by heading
south. If they want to buy,
the Dow spurts green. The
“Dow effect” encompasses
individual investors, hedge
funds, program traders, and
arbitrage traders. In addition,
the Dow moves actively in
all buy and sell programs. It



==================================================
                     PAGE 945                     
==================================================

is supply and demand at its
finest, and this is what makes
the mini-sized Dow futures
contract such a great
instrument to trade. Even
better, while an individual
stock may be halted, the YM
trades on. Even on days
where the YM could reach a
daily price limit—which is
currently a 10 percent move
in the entire index—this
could still be offset in the
cash market using the Dow

(DIA). If traders have a stock
that they own halted, there is
nothing to do but wait—
generally for pain.

Figure 4.7
Why Do Newer Traders Do
Better with the YM?
It is not an assumption that
new traders do better with
the YM. It is based on my
observation of watching
hundreds of traders go
through a process in which
they move from trading
stocks and jump into the
futures markets. They start



==================================================
                     PAGE 949                     
==================================================

trading the ES, and they lose
money. Then they switch to
the YM, and things start
taking shape and they make
money. I’ve even watched
newer traders start off in the
YM, then try the ES, then the
NQ, and then the TF—and
they always come back to the
YM. Why is this? Part of the
reason is psychological—it
just sounds better to take a
13-point profit as opposed to
an equivalent 1.25 points in



==================================================
                     PAGE 950                     
==================================================

the ES. I’ve watched ES
traders let a “small” 1.25
profit turn into a loss,
whereas a YM trader with an
equivalent 13 points will
automatically and
unhesitatingly sell off a
couple of contracts in order
to cash in some profits.
Finally, it is important to
realize that the best traders in
the world are trading the ES.
As a newer trader, it is not
the best idea to go up against



==================================================
                     PAGE 951                     
==================================================

these people. If you are just
starting out in Tai Kwon Do,
do you want to spar with a
beginning white belt or an
advanced black belt? The
YM doesn’t have the
intensity of the ES crowd.
Remember, traders are not
trading a market—they are
trading other traders. Cut
your teeth on the YM, then
venture into deeper waters.
This may seem like I’m



==================================================
                     PAGE 952                     
==================================================

knocking the ES, but I’m
really not. It’s an awesome
contract to trade, and later in
the book there are plenty of
setups in which I utilize this
contract. However, this is a
contract for professionals,
and I do think it is better for
newer and intermediate
traders to stick with the YM
in order to improve their
odds of success.

==================================================

What Does a Trader Need
to Know to Trade the Key
Commodity Markets?
I want to spend a little time
going into the contract
specifics for some of the
markets I just discussed. For
newer traders, the most
confusing thing about futures
contracts is that, unlike
stocks, each futures market
has different pricing
specifications and trades in



==================================================
                     PAGE 954                     
==================================================

different months. This makes
it tricky to figure out how
much a move is worth to a
trader’s P&L, and it is a pain
to try to figure out how to
bring up a quote. (Note that I
have listed all the month
codes in the chapter on
propulsion plays, but I will
also review some of them
here.)
If a stock trader is buying
IBM or RIMM, they both



==================================================
                     PAGE 955                     
==================================================

work the same way, even
though they are different
stocks. A move of $1 in
either stock has the same
impact on a trader’s P&L.
Unfortunately, that’s not how
it works in the futures
markets. Again, if you are
already familiar with these,
feel free to skim. My
intention for newer traders is
that you’ll be able to use this
as a quick reference guide
now and down the road as

                     PAGE 978                     
==================================================

indexes,
because I’ve
seen a lot of
press on them
in recent
months. First,
the DAX. This
is the German
equivalent of
the Dow. This
is a good
market to
trade, but it is
not for



==================================================
                     PAGE 979                     
==================================================

beginners. I’ve
seen many
traders who
normally trade
10 YM or 10
ES lots, which
are
interchangeable,
jump into the
DAX and also
trade 10 lots.
They heard
that the DAX
was like the



==================================================
                     PAGE 980                     
==================================================

Dow because
it has a trading
range similar
to the Dow,
and it’s made
up of 30 big
stocks like the
Dow, so they
go ahead and
use a 20-point
stop, just like
they would on
the Dow.
When their



==================================================
                     PAGE 981                     
==================================================

stop is hit,
they think they
should have
lost only
$1,000, but it
ends up being
$6,500. The
bottom line is
that the DAX
is a large
contract. It
trades in a
similar range
as the YM, but



==================================================
                     PAGE 982                     
==================================================

instead of $5 a
point, it’s
worth 25 euros
a point. If the
exchange rate
is 1.2937 (that
is, how many
dollars a euro
is worth), that
makes each
point worth
$32.34. This is
like trading a
little over 6



==================================================
                     PAGE 983                     
==================================================

YM or ES
contracts. In
the 10-lot
example, it
would be the
equivalent of
trading 65 lots
on the YM or
ES. This is
obviously
important to
know. The
DAX trades
from 2:00 a.m.



==================================================
                     PAGE 984

talked a lot
about the stock

has the
universal
appeal of the
gold market.
For centuries,
gold has been
coveted for its
unique blend
of rarity,
beauty, and
near-
indestructibility.
Nations have
embraced gold



==================================================
                     PAGE 990                     
==================================================

as a store of
wealth and a
medium of
international
exchange, and
individuals
have sought to
possess gold
as insurance
against the
daily
fluctuations of
paper money.
Gold is also a



==================================================
                     PAGE 991                     
==================================================

vital industrial
metal, as it is
an excellent
conductor of
electricity, it is
extremely
resistant to
corrosion, and
it is one of the
most
chemically
stable of the
elements,
making it



==================================================
                     PAGE 992                     
==================================================

critically
important in
electronics and
other high-tech
applications.
That’s all well
and good,
right? But as a
trader, all I
really care
about is
whether the
market in
question



==================================================
                     PAGE 993                     
==================================================

provides good
trading
opportunities.
Over the last
several years,
gold has
become a great
market to
trade, with
plenty of
volatility and
trending price
action. The pit
starts trading



==================================================
                     PAGE 994                     
==================================================

at 8:20 a.m.
and ends at
2:00 p.m., and
during this
time there is a
lot of action
and volume.
The electronic
version trades
right along
with the pit,
then continues
trading into
the night,



==================================================
                     PAGE 995                     
==================================================

giving nearly
24-hour access
to gold prices.
The contract
months for
gold can get
complicated.
The official
months are
“the current
month, the
next two
months, and
any February,



==================================================
                     PAGE 996                     
==================================================

April, August,
and October
falling within
a 23-month
period and any
June and
December
falling within
a 60-month
period.” For
the setups I’m
using, I’m
looking at the
front month or



==================================================
                     PAGE 997                     
==================================================

the next month
out, which
means that
every month is
in play. The
rest of the
available
trading months
are for people
who are
looking at
hedging many
years into the
future. I like to



==================================================
                     PAGE 998                     
==================================================

establish
trades in this
contract during
pit session
hours for day
trades, but I
will also trade
it overnight if
the setup is
strong. Gold
moves in
increments of
10 cents, and
each 10 cents



==================================================
                     PAGE 999

is worth $10
per contract. A
full $1 move
in the price of
gold is worth
$100 per
contract. Note
that to get
quotes, traders
have to be
signed up for
COMEX data
through their
quote vendor.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1000                     
==================================================

What about
silver? The
5,000-oz silver
contract is a
big one. Each
1-point move
is worth
$5,000, and it
moves in ½-
cent
increments.
Each 1-cent
move is
$50.00. Silver



==================================================
                    PAGE 1001

==================================================

answers the
question,
“What if I
don’t really
want to trade
100 ounces of
gold at a
time?” This
contract
represents 10
ounces of
gold, so
instead of a
full $1.00

==================================================

the CBOT in
1975 in
response to a
growing
market need
for tools that
could protect
against sharp
and frequent
swings in the
cost of money.
U.S. Treasury
bond futures
were



==================================================
                    PAGE 1005                     
==================================================

introduced
first, followed
by futures on
10-year, 5-
year, and 2-
year U.S.
Treasury
notes. Over the
past two
decades,
contract
volume has
exploded,
reflecting the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1006                     
==================================================

growth of the
underlying
instruments
and profound
changes in the
marketplace. If
you focus
primarily on
the stock
market, it is
critical that
you become
familiar with
bonds. The

                    PAGE 1007                     
==================================================

dwarf the
equity
markets.
Therefore, it is
important for
you to know
when money is
flowing out of
bonds or into
bonds. The
bond markets
and the stock
markets also

                    PAGE 1008

interesting
relationship.
Sometimes
they move
directly
opposite each
other, during
periods of
portfolio
reallocation.
This happens
when huge
funds have to

                    PAGE 1009                     
==================================================

sell stocks and
buy bonds to
readjust the
percentage of
capital that
they have
invested in
each. During
these times,
new highs in
the bond
market lead to
new lows in
the stock

                    PAGE 1010

market, and
thus bonds
become a great
leading
indicator. The

trades from
8:20 a.m. to
3:00 p.m.,
Monday
through

Soybeans (S).
My
appreciation of
the grain
markets came
about through
an accident. I
own a 1,000-
acre farm in
Palisade,
Nebraska, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1016                     
==================================================

because of that
I started
watching the
grain futures
prices. I liked
the way they
traded, and,
once I learned
about the
contract
specifications,
I realized that
they trade very
similarly to the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1017                     
==================================================

E-mini S&Ps
and mini-sized
Dow.
Soybeans trade
in the pit from
10:30 a.m. to
2:15 p.m.,
Monday
through
Friday. There
is also an
electronic
session that
runs from 8:31



==================================================
                    PAGE 1018                     
==================================================

p.m. to 7:00
a.m. The
symbol for this
is ZS, but I
don’t watch
this session or
trade it. I focus
on this
contract during
the pit hours,
but I trade the
electronic
contract.
Soybeans



==================================================
                    PAGE 1019                     
==================================================

move in
increments of
¼ cent, and
each ¼ cent is
worth $12.50.
A full cent is
worth $50.
This is just
like the E-mini
S&Ps, where
they move in
quarter-point
increments
worth $12.50,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1020                     
==================================================

and a full point
is worth $50.
An 8-cent
move in
soybeans is
just like an 8-
point move in
the ES or an
80-point move
in the YM and
is worth $400.
Soybeans trade
in September
(U),



==================================================
                    PAGE 1021                     
==================================================

November
(X), January
(F), March
(H), May (K),
July (N), and
August (Q).
Soybeans are
the most
volatile of the
three grains.
They generally
trade in a
range equal to
1½ times that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1022                     
==================================================

of the ES and
YM.
Corn (C).
Everything
about corn is
the same as
that for
soybeans
except that the
contract
months are
December,
March, May,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1023                     
==================================================

July, and
September.
This is the
quietest of the
three grains. A
one-cent move
is worth $50,
just like in
soybeans.
There is a
saying in
trading circles
that goes, “If
you can’t



==================================================
                    PAGE 1024                     
==================================================

make money
trading, then
trade corn.”
Wheat (W).
Everything
about wheat is
the same as
that for corn,
and a one-cent
move in this
market is also
worth $50.
Note that all



==================================================
                    PAGE 1025                     
==================================================

quarter-cent
moves in
grains are
recorded as
eighths. So a
price of 3414
actually means
3.41½ (3.41
and ), and
3416 means
3.41¾ (3.41
and ).

                    PAGE 1026

lumping all of
these together

known as



==================================================
                    PAGE 1027                     
==================================================

forex. I’m not
a big fan of the
forex cash
market, as it is
unregulated.
The cash forex
guys
completely
outmarketed
the regulated
exchanges
when it came
to trading
currencies,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1028                     
==================================================

which is why a
lot of people
are surprised
to hear that
you can
actually trade
currencies on a
regulated
futures
exchange. The
currencies that
matter are
called the
majors (the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1029                     
==================================================

major world
currencies as
they trade
against the
U.S. dollar),
and they are as
follows: the
euro (EC/6E),
the Australian
dollar
(AD/6A), the
Canadian
dollar
(CD/6C), the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1030                     
==================================================

British pound
(BP/6B), the
Swiss franc
(SF/6S), and
the Japanese
yen (JY/6J).
For the
symbols, I
listed those for
both the pit

contract (6E).
There is no
need to trade
the smaller
markets, such
as the Mexican
peso/U.S.
dollar or the
krona/shekel
cross. There
are plenty of
opportunities
in the big
contracts,

course are also
the most
liquid. Also
note that if you
hear quotes for

==================================================

cent
increments,
with 100 cents
equaling a full
“big figure”
move (for
example, from
1.4300 to
1.4400 is a
100-tick or
“full point”
move). It is
important to
note that the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1035                     
==================================================

contracts do
have different
tick values,
and they are as
follows: EC,
JY, and SF:
$12.50 per tick
and $1,250.00
per full point;
AD and CD:
$10.00 per tick
and $1,000.00
per full point;
BP: $6.25 per

$625.00 per
full point.
Note that those
prices are for
both the pit

that you can
also trade
“U.S. dollar

trader’s P&L.
That is the basic
information for the trader on
these futures contracts. One
important thing to keep in
mind is how all these
contracts translate in terms of
price movement with respect
to the risk management
techniques traders choose to
utilize in their own trading
plan. Let’s take a look at an
example stop loss taken in

                    PAGE 1049                     
==================================================

the NQ.
Figure 4.8 shows a 12-
point loss that was taken in
the NQ, which equates to a
loss of $240 per contract. If a
trader wants to use a
monetary stop of
approximately $240 for
every trade in every market,
then it is helpful to create a
reference sheet of how this
translates into other markets.
This way, a trader will be



==================================================
                    PAGE 1050                     
==================================================

less prone to making a
pricing error when it comes
to figuring out appropriate
stop losses in various futures
markets. In this chart, we can
see that a 12-point stop in the
Nasdaq is equal to a 4.75-
point stop in the S&Ps,
which is equal to a 48-point
stop in the YM, which is
equal to a 2.40-point stop on
the Russell (on the chart, this
is shown as symbol ER; it
now trades under the symbol

                    PAGE 1051

TF), which is equal to an 8-
tick stop on the 30-year
bonds, which is equal to a
19-tick stop on the euro. This
also equals a 24-cent stop on
crude oil, a 48-cent stop on
mini-crude oil, a 2.40 stop on
gold, a 7.20 stop on mini-
gold, and a 4¾-cent stop on
the grains. That’s the golden
rule in futures— know your
monetary stop, and then be
able to know what that
means in tick values across

“forex” or “FX,” is the

the world, with a daily
average turnover of well over

“Foreign exchange” is
literally the simultaneous

(EUR/USD) or U.S.

This is truly a 24-hour

One thing I like about the

four major market opens that
offer the same volatility and
liquidity found in the one-

first is the Japanese open at

Eurozone opens at 12:00 a.m.

3:00 a.m. EST, and bringing
up the rear is the New York

the New York open and
sometimes the Japanese

I know who trade all the

dictated by their work, which
for some people can include
odd hours. With the
availability of these four
opens, a trader can fit at least
one of these times into any

The forex markets are
among the most technical

meaning that they respond
well to most technical
analysis studies. It is not
uncommon to see a 300-pip

change trend at a technical
level to within 5 pips. (A
“pip” is to forex as a “point”
is to the stock index futures.)

A trader also doesn’t have
to worry about contract
rollovers in the forex market.
It is possible to buy a few
lots of the EUR/USD,
GBP/USD, and AUD/USD,
place a stop, and forget about
it for months at a time. FX
dealers automatically roll
your position from one day
to the next for you to prevent
the event of delivery.
In addition, most FX



==================================================
                    PAGE 1066                     
==================================================

dealers offer a negative-
balance protection guarantee
that ensures that your
account will never reach a
position of negative equity,
which can happen in the
stock market for traders who
are maxed out on margin as
well as the futures market.
There is an interesting way to
take advantage of this.
People can open up FX
accounts at different dealers
and deposit a small portion



==================================================
                    PAGE 1067                     
==================================================

of their overall trading
capital. They can go long a
currency in one account and
short the same currency in
another account, then just
leave both accounts alone,
with no stops or targets.
While the two positions are
open, they will offset each
other equally, so it’s a perfect
hedge. If one of the
currencies then gets into a
prolonged move, one of the
accounts will get closed



==================================================
                    PAGE 1068                     
==================================================

when the account equity gets
to zero. At this point, the
trader is still at breakeven on
the trade because the losses
in one account are offset by
gains in the other account. If
the currency then continues
to trend in the open account,
the trader benefits from
already being “in the move.”
I don’t do this personally, but
a few traders I know have
done this and have had
instances where accounts in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1069                     
==================================================

the neighborhood of $20,000
have turned into accounts in
the neighborhood of
$400,000 on the backs of a
couple of great moves. The
key is that these traders take
the positions and literally
forget about them for six
months. The currency just
has to trend one way or the
other. This obviously
involves some luck, and I
wouldn’t call it a “core
strategy of any wise

                    PAGE 1070

retirement plan.” My favorite
reason for trading the forex
markets (and this applies
equally well to currency
futures markets) is that they
trend better than any other
markets. Once a market gets
going, it can easily trend for
weeks and months in a nice
steady march higher or
lower. Unlike the stock
market, which can often
consolidate for years at a
time (although not since the

                    PAGE 1071                     
==================================================

financial crisis of 2008),
there are real trends
happening all the time in the
forex markets. Stock market
traders talk of missing the
big moves of the dotcom
days. Today the dot-com
moves are happening in the
forex markets.
The biggest complaint
I’ve heard people say about
forex is that the FX dealers
are taking the other side of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1072                     
==================================================

their trade. I usually hear this
from people who have
overtraded their account and
have lost all their money.
This is really true in any
market—somebody is always
taking the other side of your
trade. In my experience with
forex, however, it is the high-
frequency day traders who
don’t last. On the other hand,
the traders who place smaller
positions and let them work
out over the course of a few



==================================================
                    PAGE 1073                     
==================================================

days to a few weeks or
longer do well. As in any
trade, market makers can
mess with a position in the
very short term, but over the
course of a swing trade, they
have no power. When
George Soros was short the
British pound and was told
that the British government
had allocated the equivalent
of 20 billion U.S. dollars to
stabilize the currency, he
shrugged and said, “That will



==================================================
                    PAGE 1074                     
==================================================

help them for 30 minutes.
Then what are they going to
do?” He made more than a
billion dollars on that trade.
How Are Forex Moves
Measured?
Forex trading, like many new
things, is confusing yet
simple. If a quote for the
EUR/USD is 1.23, this
simply means that 1 euro is
equal to 1.23 U.S. dollars. A



==================================================
                    PAGE 1075                     
==================================================

quote for the USD/JPY at
109.50 simply means that 1
U.S. dollar is equal to 109.50
Japanese yen (see Figure
4.10).



==================================================
                    PAGE 1076                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 1077                     
==================================================

Figure 4.10
Forex markets move in
what are called pips. A pip
(price interest point) is the
smallest unit of price for any
foreign currency.
• EUR/USD trading from
1.2300 to 1.2301 = a
gain of 1 pip
• USD/JPY trading from
108.01 to 108.09 = a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1078                     
==================================================

gain of 8 pips
• GBP/USD trading from
1.8302 to 1.8311 = a
gain of 9 pips
• EUR/USD trading from
1.2300 to 1.2401 = a
gain of 101 pips
A full one-cent move in
the currency is equal to 100
pips.
How Do You Calculate Pip



==================================================
                    PAGE 1079                     
==================================================

Values?
First, we start with the
complicated way pip values
are calculated, which is as
follows:
• (1 pip, including decimal
point/current exchange
rate) × (notional amount)
• For the EUR/USD this
translates into:



==================================================
                    PAGE 1080                     
==================================================

• But we want the pip
value in U.S. dollars, not
euros, so we go one step
further:
What this boils down to is
this: any forex contract that
ends in USD is worth $10 per
pip, or $1,000 for a full 1-
cent move (100 pips). The
euro, for example, moves in
a range of 80 to 150 pips per
day. This $10-per-pip



==================================================
                    PAGE 1081                     
==================================================

calculation would include the
euro (EUR/USD), pound
(GBP/USD), and other such
contracts. These are the
contracts that most people
trade. It gets a little trickier
when this is not the case. For
example, on March 29, 2005,
a USD/JPY contract and any
additional contracts that
ended in JPY were $9.35 per
pip. On this same day, any
contract that ended in CHF
was $8.29 per pip. The



==================================================
                    PAGE 1082                     
==================================================

EUR/GBP was $18.70 per
pip, and so on, based on the
various exchange rates.
Again, most traders seem to
focus on currencies that end
in USD, so the $10 per pip
has become a universal
number when talking about
forex. There is also a mini-
version of these contracts in
which each pip is worth $1.
What Happens to Currencies
When Prices Change?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1083                     
==================================================

If a quote for the USD/JPY is
at 108.00, it means that it
takes 1 U.S. dollar to buy
108 Japanese yen. If the price
moves to 109.00, this means
that the yen has weakened
against the dollar, because it
now requires more yen to
obtain the same 1 U.S. dollar.
If the EUR/USD is trading at
1.20, this means that 1 euro
can buy 1.20 U.S. dollars. A
move to 1.22 means that the
euro has strengthened against



==================================================
                    PAGE 1084                     
==================================================

the U.S. dollar because it
requires more U.S. dollars to
obtain the same 1 euro.
How Can You Hedge Your
Own Life in the Forex
Markets?

for forex that work in smaller
time frames, and I talk more
about these setups later in the
book. However, the
fascinating thing about the

ability to participate in world
events on different scales and
essentially “hedge their life.”



==================================================

Figure 4.11
For example, my wife and
I visited Spain, France, and
Italy from December 18,
2003, through January 14,
2004. (Yes, it’s colder then,
but there aren’t any lines.)
Excluding airfare, I added up
the estimated costs in euros.
On the day we booked this
trip, September 30, 2003, the
exchange rate was 1.1675.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1088                     
==================================================

Based on this rate, I
estimated that the trip would
cost U.S. $15,000. This cost
would fall if the euro fell, but
would increase if the price of
the euro also increased. I
pulled up a chart (see Figure
4.11).
In this figure, point 2
shows where the market was
trading on the day we booked
the trip. Point 1 shows the
all-time highs at 1.1932 that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1089                     
==================================================

had been hit on May 27,
2003. For our trip, I wanted
the euro to fall so that our
costs would also fall.
However, just because I
wanted the euro to fall didn’t
mean that it would. If the
euro took off, our trip could
get considerably more
expensive. Since a regular
contract represents $100,000
worth of U.S. currency, it
was much too large to use as
a hedge. The minis each



==================================================
                    PAGE 1090                     
==================================================

represent $10,000 worth of
U.S. currency, so this is
where I looked to set up a
position.
Looking at the chart on
this day, I decided to place a
buy stop order for two mini
EUR/USD contracts at
1.1933, one pip above the
all-time highs. This buy stop
order meant that I would get
into the market only if the
euro traded up and through



==================================================
                    PAGE 1091                     
==================================================

1.1933. Instead of getting
stopped out of a short
position, I would be getting
stopped into a long position,
since I was currently flat.
I decided to do this at this
higher level, instead of at the
immediate price, in case the
euro did roll over and fall. If
it fell from where it was
when we booked our tickets,
it would be a plus for us, as
our trip would get cheaper



==================================================
                    PAGE 1092                     
==================================================

with each decline. However,
if the euro broke out to new
highs, it could ignite a huge
rally and really inflate our
trip budget. One mini-
contract represents $10,000,
so I was essentially hedging
$20,000 in U.S. currency
with the two mini-contracts.
Since I underestimated how
much the trip would cost, this
actually worked out perfectly
in the end.

On November 18, almost
two months later, my buy
stop was hit at point 3. By
the time we left for our trip at
point 4, the euro had moved
more than 500 pips from my
entry. By the time we got
home at point 5, I closed out
the position at 1.2665, a gain
of 732 pips. Two mini-
contracts equaled a gain of
$1,464, which paid for the
increased exchange rate we
had to pay while we were



==================================================
                    PAGE 1094                     
==================================================

over there. Had the euro hit
my buy stop and then sold
off to 1.10, I would have lost
money on the trade, but this
would have been offset by
the money saved during the
trip because of the more
favorable exchange rate. Had
I set this up as a “normal”
trade using five regular-sized
contracts, a 732-pip move
would have equaled $36,600.
There are many other



==================================================
                    PAGE 1095                     
==================================================

ways in which people can
“hedge their life” in the forex
markets. For people who
think the value of the U.S.
dollar is going to continue to
decline and are worried about
the value of their savings
deteriorating against other
world currencies, they can
hedge their savings account
by going long the EUR/USD.
If a person has $240,000 in
savings, she can buy two
regular contracts and four

                    PAGE 1096                     
==================================================

mini-contracts, and have a
perfect hedge.
For Traders, Is This All
You Need to Know?
The biggest question traders
always ask is, “How much
money do I need to buy one
contract, and what happens
after I buy it?” For forex, it
can vary based on your
broker, but in general, to buy
one regular-sized contract, a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1097                     
==================================================

trader will need about
$1,000, and to buy a mini-
contract, a trader will need
about $100. This depends on
the leverage that the broker is
offering. A typical scenario
is that traders will open up a
small mini-account with
$500 and get 200:1 leverage.
They will then buy two mini
EUR/USD contracts, and this
will cost them $130. Their
$500 account now has $371
in available equity, after the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1098                     
==================================================

$129 in margin has been
deducted. In the worst-case
scenario (which can happen),
the trade goes completely
wrong. It will have to move
185 pips against the traders
(which wipes out their $371
in equity) before their
position is closed out by the
dealer—provided they have
zero-balance protection. The
$130 in margin that was used
to establish the position is
returned to the account,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1099                     
==================================================

bringing the balance down
from $500 to $130. If the
trade works out, gains 55
pips on two mini-contracts,
and is sold, then this $110
profit is put into the account
along with the initial margin,
and the total balance then
becomes $610, less
transaction costs. If a trader
is using the big contracts in
this scenario, everything is
the same except that it is
times 10.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1100                     
==================================================

How much does this cost
in terms of transaction fees?
Well, the spread is typically
3 pips wide in the EUR/USD
for most FX dealers, which is
what the trader pays instead
of commissions. It’s still a
transaction cost—anyone
who calls this “commission-
free” trading should be
hanged. For the minis, it
equates to $3 per side, and
for the regular contracts, it’s
$30 per side. The spreads



==================================================
                    PAGE 1101                     
==================================================

will continue to narrow, and
this will get cheaper. This
isn’t much different from
trading the ES. In this case,
the spread is $12.50. Add,
say, an $8 round turn cost,
and now you are really
trading $20.50 a round turn.
A trader should always add
the spread into his
transaction costs.
I personally spend most of
my time watching the

==================================================

opportunities, and they all
tend to move together. It is
also important to have a chart
of the dollar composite index
($DXY on both TradeStation
and TOS). In general, if the
dollar index is moving
higher, then USD/JPY,
USD/CHF, and USD/CAD
are also moving higher. This
action will push EUR/USD,
GBP/USD, and AUD/USD
lower. When the financial
news networks mention that

==================================================

“Warren Buffett is short the
dollar,” he is really long
EUR/USD, GBP/USD,
and/or AUD/USD and short
USD/CHF, USD/JPY, and/or
USD/CAD. If the dollar goes
lower, then the first three
currency pairs will move in
the opposite direction from
the dollar and go higher, and
the last three currency pairs
will move lower with the
dollar.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1108                     
==================================================

For the futures markets,
the price movements on EC,
BP, and AD are identical to
their cash counterparts in
EURUSD, GBPUSD, and
AUDUSD. However, the
futures quotes on JY, CD,
and SF are inverted. This is
because they are quoted
based on dollars (just as
EURUSD is quoted in
dollars). For example,
USDJPY may be trading at
115.12, which tells a trader



==================================================
                    PAGE 1109                     
==================================================

that 1 U.S. dollar is equal to
115.12 yen. Meanwhile, JY
is trading at 0.8692, which
tells a trader that 100 yen are
worth $0.8692 dollar (or
1,000 yen are worth $8.692
or 10,000 yen are worth
$86.92, and so on). The
reason for this is that the JY
futures chart is based on a
pairing of JPYUSD, whereas
the cash market is based on
USDJPY. Simple, right? For
currency futures, if you want



==================================================
                    PAGE 1110                     
==================================================

to play a short on the dollar,
then you just buy any one of
those six futures contracts. If
you want to play a dollar
long, then you short any of
the six futures contracts. For
newer traders who are trying
to decide between trading
cash forex and currency
futures, I would suggest
going into the currency
futures markets because of
the additional advantages
described earlier.

As I’m writing this book,
the MF Global mess has been
unfolding before my eyes.
For those of you who aren’t
familiar with this, MF Global
was a major global financial
derivatives broker, and many
traders, especially hedge
funds, traded futures
contracts through MF Global.
On Monday, October 31,
2011, MF Global admitted a
transfer of $700 million from
customer accounts to its U.K.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1112                     
==================================================

subsidiary to mask liquidity
shortfalls at the company that
resulted from wrong-way
bets on European debts.
Customer accounts were
frozen, and MF Global filed
the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy. As I’m writing
this, cleints have received
about 75 percent of their
funds back, and are still
waiting to see what happened
to the rest. (Canadian clients,
because of stricter Canadian



==================================================
                    PAGE 1113                     
==================================================

banking laws, received all of
their funds back in 10 days.)
This incident has put a
blemish, to put it lightly, on
the futures industry. Hedge
funds have gone out of
business, careers and
businesses have been
destroyed. Individual traders
continue to wait for the
remaining 25 percent of their
funds. I didn’t have any
accounts at MF Global



==================================================
                    PAGE 1114                     
==================================================

(sometimes its better to be
lucky than smart) but I know
many traders who did. The
questions that keep surfacing
are, “Should I keep trading
futures? Is my money safe?”
I’m personally still trading
futures for the reasons I’ve
already described. I of course
don’t have all of my assets
exposed to futures or sitting
in a futures account. I’ve also
re-double-checked the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1115                     
==================================================

brokers that I use (the ones
I’ve listed in this book) to
make sure they aren’t making
any ridiculous bets on
European debt (they aren’t).
Does that mean all is good?
Unfortunately, no. This
incident raises a ton of
issues, and I predict that the
CME Group will need to lead
a taskforce to set up account
guarantees, much like what is
already in place in the stock
industry. In the long run, that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1116                     
==================================================

would be good for traders,
and it would restore
confidence in the futures
markets. In the short term,
this is an ugly mess that is
not going to go away. The
net result is that I’m still
trading futures and am
awaiting the next steps taken
in the industry with keen
interest.
For additional
information, we’ve set up

fascinating type of trading,
simply because there are so
many different things you
can do with options. And
when it comes to options,
there are generally two types
of retail traders. The first
doesn’t know anything about
them. The second tried
buying an option (most likely
an out-of-the-money call),
lost money, and then
discovered that a person
could also sell options and

collect the premium. This
type of trader now knows the
300 different ways to collect
premiums (for example, a
clipped-wing, four-legged,
three-eyed butterfly) and
spends a lot of time legging
into and out of option
positions, making a little
money each month. This
tends to work for many
months—until it doesn’t, and
then it gets very ugly very
quickly. In other words, even

everything there is to know
about options, they still can’t
make a consistent income
trading them. With options,
too much knowledge isn’t
necessarily a good thing.
I utilize a few basic
strategies when it comes to
options trading. I like to keep
things simple. I focus both on
directional plays and on

What Would You Pay for a
First-Class Plane Ticket to
Singapore?
Imagine that you are on a
flight from Chicago to
Singapore. It’s a mind-
numbing 17-hour oxygen-
depleted journey. By a stroke
of luck, you get upgraded to
first class. Score! You sit



==================================================
                    PAGE 1124                     
==================================================

down, get comfortable, and
get ready to enjoy this 17-
hour flight in style. Just
before takeoff, a hedge fund
manager walks up to you and
whispers, “Hey, I got stuck
back in coach. I’d like to
give you money to switch
seats with me. How much do
you want?” Well, this is a
new twist. You love your
seat. You don’t want to leave
your seat—but how much is
this guy willing to give you



==================================================
                    PAGE 1125                     
==================================================

for it? You go back and
forth, and he says he is
willing to give you no more
than $1,500.00 for the seat.
You tell him it would have
cost him $20,000.00 if he
had booked it online. “True,”
he says. “But you got it for
free. The question here is
how much money do you
want for it.” You think about
it and tell him that $1,500.00
is too low—but if he lets you
sit there for the first 5 hours,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1126                     
==================================================

he can have it for the last 12.
“Deal,” he says.
Five hours go by, and he
comes back to your seat,
ready to switch. He hands
you $1,200.00. “Wait a
second,” you say. “I thought
we agreed on $1,500.00.” He
gives you a funny look and
says, “Well, yeah, that was
when there was a 17-hour
flight in front of us; now it’s
only 12 hours. Time is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1127                     
==================================================

running out.” You tell him
you want to think about it.
Disgruntled, he walks off.
You unwittingly pass out in
your seat. Later, after 9 hours
of glorious sleep, you wake
up. “Hey buddy,” he says,
looking as if he’s been stuck
in coach for 14 hours, “Are
you ready to switch seats
yet?” Sure, you say. He
hands over $300. “Where’s
the rest of it?” you ask. He
explains, annoyingly, that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1128                     
==================================================

you slept for 9 hours, and
there are only 3 hours left in
the flight. At this point, he
might as well sit in coach,
but he’s still willing to give
you $300 to have possession
of your seat for the last few
hours. You think about it,
realize that in 3 hours your
seat will be worthless (this
guy isn’t going to pay
anything after the plane
lands), and you take the $300
to switch seats. That is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1129                     
==================================================

essentially premium decay in
action on an “at-the-money”
call. The closer you get to the
end of the flight, the lower
the price you could get for
your first-class seat.
In my first options trade, I
bought call options on Intel
(INTC), and I hadn’t the
foggiest notion what they
were or what that meant.
Later I found out that a call
option increases in value if



==================================================
                    PAGE 1130                     
==================================================

the underlying stock moves
higher, and a put option
increases in value if the
underlying stock moves
lower. So buying a call is
like going long, and buying a
put is like going short. And
one option represents 100
shares of stock. So when you
see a stock option priced at
$4.30, that is per share of
stock. Since each option
represents 100 shares of
stock, one option at $4.30



==================================================
                    PAGE 1131                     
==================================================

costs $430.00. Easy enough?
Then I learned about
strike prices, and how
options were either in the
money, at the money, or out
of the money. Great. So if
AAPL (Apple) is trading at
$399.26 per share, and I’m
looking at call options, then
the $390 call is in the money
(trading below the current
stock price, also called ITM
for short), the $400 call is at



==================================================
                    PAGE 1132                     
==================================================

the money (trading at or near
the current price, also called
ATM for short), and the $410
call is out of the money
(trading above the current
price, also called OTM for
short).
The $390 call is “in the
money” because it gives the
option buyer the right to buy
the stock for $390. Simple
math shows that if the stock
is trading at $399.26, then



==================================================
                    PAGE 1133                     
==================================================

the $390 call option is worth
$9.26. It works like this. If
that option gives me the right
to buy the stock at $390.00,
and the stock is trading at
$399.26, then I can
immediately go out into the
open market and sell the
stock I acquired for $390.00
for $399.26, thus making a
$9.26 profit. This portion of
the option price is known as
the real or intrinsic value of
the option. But if it were this



==================================================
                    PAGE 1134                     
==================================================

simple, then wouldn’t both
the $400 and the $410 strike
be worth nothing, since the
stock is actually trading at
$399.26, below both of those
levels?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1135

Figure 5.1
And that is where
premium comes in. Figure
5.1 shows the actual prices of
these options. These options
have 24 days of life left, at
which point they will expire.
When an option expires, it is
literally worth only the real
value that a person would get
if he exchanged it for stock.
That is, if it was expiration
day and AAPL was at



==================================================
                    PAGE 1137                     
==================================================

$400.00 a share, then any
call options above that price
would be worth zero (expire
worthless, since they have no
intrinsic value), and any call
options below that price
would be worth the price of
the actual stock less the
strike price. So, in this case,
the $390 calls would be
worth $10 (if AAPL closed
at exactly $400.00). And the
$410 calls, which give the
option holder the right to buy



==================================================
                    PAGE 1138                     
==================================================

AAPL at a price of $410.00,
would be worth zero. After
all, you can go out in the
open market and get it for
$400.00, so why would you
pay anybody for the “right”
to buy it at $410.00?
And yet when we look at
the prices of these options 24
days out from expiration, we
notice a very strange thing.
The $390.00 calls are not
trading at just the intrinsic



==================================================
                    PAGE 1139                     
==================================================

value of about $10.00; they
are trading at a whopping
$22.75, well above the
$10.00 they would be worth
if this were expiration day.
The $410 calls, which would
be worth zero in this example
if it were the close of options
expiration day, are trading
for $12.30 ($1,230.00 per
option contract). The $400
calls, which would also be
worth zero in this example if
it were the close of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1140                     
==================================================

expiration day, are trading at
$17.00 ($1,700.00 per
options contract). What
gives?
Just as with that first-class
seat, there are people out
there who will pay a
premium to buy the option,
even if it’s trading out of the
money. Why? The stock
could have a huge rally, and
the option could be worth a
lot more in the future. And



==================================================
                    PAGE 1141                     
==================================================

the further out the expiration
date (that is, the longer the
flight), the more premium
they are willing to pay. Why
not just buy the stock?
Because they don’t want to
shell out a lot of money to
buy the actual stock. Thus
they are willing to pay a
premium to own the right to
buy the stock and to take
advantage of the limited risk
and leverage involved in
buying the option. Note that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1142                     
==================================================

while the $390.00 option has
some real value priced in, the
$400.00 and $410.00 options
are pure premium. The in-
the-money call is a mixture
of intrinsic value and
premium.
On the flip side, someone
who owns the stock has to
make a similar decision.
Does she sell an option
against it and collect the
premium? She wants to keep



==================================================
                    PAGE 1143                     
==================================================

the stock, so her goal is to
sell an option against it that
will expire worthless. That is,
she hopes that the stock price
doesn’t close above the strike
price by the expiration date.
As a buyer of an option, just
like the guy who wanted to
buy the right to sit in your
first-class seat, you are
buying with the expectation
of a better experience.
Instead of shelling out
$40,000.00 to buy 100 shares



==================================================
                    PAGE 1144                     
==================================================

of AAPL at $400, you could
pay $1,700.00 to buy a
$400.00 call option. With
each passing day, the
premium on that option
erodes a little bit. And the
closer that option gets to
expiration (that is, the closer
the plane gets to the airport),
the faster that premium starts
to lose value. Your bet in this
case is that AAPL has a
fantastic move higher,
perhaps to $450.00. If it



==================================================
                    PAGE 1145                     
==================================================

does, at expiration, your
$400 option will be trading at
$50.00, and your profit on
the trade will be $3,300.00
(the $5,000.00 sale price less
the $1,700.00 purchase
price). In other words, you
were able to participate in
AAPL’s rally without having
to shell out all the money
required to buy the stock. In
fact, in trading, owning the
stock is sort of like sitting in
coach.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1146                     
==================================================

On the flip side, the
woman who sold you the
option does not want to see
AAPL go to $450. She is
hoping that the stock stays
near $400 and that the option
you bought for $1,700.00
expires worthless. Where did
your $1,700.00 go? To the
person who sold you the
option. That goes right into
her pocket. It’s like the
AAPL stock she owns is a
piece of property, and she



==================================================
                    PAGE 1147                     
==================================================

just charged you $1.700.00
for a month’s rent, thank you
very much.
Everything that we’ve just
talked about has focused on
the “call” side of the options
world, but the same story
holds true for the put side. In
Figure 5.1, where AAPL is
trading at $399.26, we can
see that the out-of-the-money
put at $390.00 is trading at
$12.65, the at-the-money put



==================================================
                    PAGE 1148                     
==================================================

at $400.00 is trading at
$16.95, and the in-the-
money” put at $410.00 is
trading at $22.25.
Why Wouldn’t I Buy These
Particular Options with My
Mother-in-Law’s Trading
Account?
Okay, up to this point, I’ve
been talking about what
options are and how they
work. Now let’s talk about



==================================================
                    PAGE 1149                     
==================================================

the main reason that people
lose money trading options.
It’s very simple: it’s because
they focus mainly on buying
cheap out-of-the-money call
options. In Figure 5.1, the
$410.00 AAPL call options
are trading at $12.30. This is
100 percent premium. There
is zero intrinsic value here. In
this case, the trader looked at
the $390.00 call options, but
found them to be “too
expensive” at $22.75. AAPL



==================================================
                    PAGE 1150                     
==================================================

is currently at $399.26. Let’s
say it had a nice steady move
into expiration, rallying just
over $10.00 per share, and
closed at $409.75. A trader
bought the $410.00 call
option because he thought
AAPL would go up. He was
right. It did. How much
money is his option worth at
expiration? A big goose egg.
He lost every dime. In fact,
AAPL would have had to
close above $422.30 for him



==================================================
                    PAGE 1151                     
==================================================

to make a profit on this trade.
At $422.30, the $410.00 call
option at expiration is worth
$12.30—the exact price that
he paid for the option.
Although he didn’t lose
money on the trade, he didn’t
make anything either. In
other words, when buying
out-of-the-money call
options, not only does a
trader have to be right, but he
has to be right in a big way.
A steady move higher won’t



==================================================
                    PAGE 1152                     
==================================================

do. It has to be explosive.
In this same scenario, had
the trader bought the
“expensive” $390.00 call
option at $22.75, a move to
$422.30 would price the call,
at expiration, at $32.30,
resulting in a profit of $9.55
($955.00) on the trade.
Would you rather buy an
option for $2,275 and make
$955 or buy an option for
$1,230 and make $0.00?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1153                     
==================================================

Buying an option “just
because it’s cheap” is a
ridiculous trading strategy. In
the options world, a fairly
common scenario is (1) retail
traders buy out-of-the-money
calls (without paying
attention to fair value or
implied volatility; more on
that later), and (2)
professional traders gladly
sell them these calls all day
long. “Hey, you want some
more?” they ask eagerly.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1154                     
==================================================

“Because we’ve got more to
sell you.” I’ve known guys
who have traded options on
the floor for more than 20
years. They have never
bought an out-of-the-money
call. Not one. To them, there
could be nothing worse on
this planet than buying an
out-of-the-money call.
That’s not to say that out-
of-the-money options don’t
have their place. Believe it or



==================================================
                    PAGE 1155                     
==================================================

not, there are scenarios
where it can make sense to
buy them, but these are the
exception rather than the
rule. And this brings me to
my first options strategy.
Directional Plays: Why Is
Delta 0.70 or Better
Superior?
Buying a cheap out-of-the-
money option is enticing
because if it works out, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1156                     
==================================================

trade could win in a big way.
Everyone wants to be able to
buy an option for $1.00 and
sell it for $15.00. That’s the
“quit your job and travel the
world” trade if it’s done
right. Yes, this could happen
with an out-of-the-money
option, just like you could
get a royal flush when you’re
playing poker. The odds
aren’t great, but the chance is
there, however remote.
Personally, I’m more



==================================================
                    PAGE 1157                     
==================================================

interested in increasing the
odds for creating a consistent
income stream than crossing
my fingers and swinging for
the fence.
Figure 5.2 lays out an
option diagram with “the
Greeks,” known as delta,
gamma, theta, and vega. The
good news is that, for what I
like to do, a trader doesn’t
need to know too much about
these. The only one I want to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1158                     
==================================================

talk about here is delta. This
is important. Delta simply
tells us how far the option
price will move in relation to
each $1.00 move in the
underlying stock. A delta of
1.00 means that the option
price will move right along
with the stock, dollar for
dollar. If the stock moves up
$1.00, then the option will
move up $1.00. A delta of
0.10 means that if the stock
moves up $1.00, then the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1159                     
==================================================

option will move up only 10
cents. The deeper in the
money the call option is, the
higher the delta. The further
out of the money it is, the
lower the delta.
For purely directional
plays, I simply view the
option as a cheaper way to
participate in the price
movement of the underlying
stock. One of the plays I’ll
talk about later in the book



==================================================
                    PAGE 1160                     
==================================================

(the squeeze play) is a
favorite of mine for option
plays. This setup indicates a
high probability that the
stock is ready to make a
larger-than-average move. In
this case, I simply want to
participate in the movement
of the stock, without having
to fork over all the money
required to buy the actual
stock. For these trades, I
simply buy an in-the-money
option with a delta of 0.70 or



==================================================
                    PAGE 1161                     
==================================================

higher. This means that as
the stock price moves in my
favor, the option will move
right along with it at the rate
of 70 cents for every dollar
the stock moves. As a bonus,
as the stock moves my way,
placing my option even
deeper in the money, the
delta also increases. For the
first 2 points of a move, my
option might move $1.40 (70
cents per dollar). For the next
2 points, it might move



==================================================
                    PAGE 1162                     
==================================================

$1.60, as the delta increases
from 0.70 to 0.80. A far-out-
of-the-money option, on the
other hand, will stay at a low
delta for quite some time.
Buying far-out-of-the-money
options is a lose/lose, unless
you have some inside
information, such as Bear
Stearns being about to
collapse. Someone actually
bought $1.4 million in far-
out-of-the-money put options
a few weeks before Bear



==================================================
                    PAGE 1163                     
==================================================

Stearns went bankrupt. He
knew what was coming down
the pipeline, and he made a
fortune.

Figure 5.2
In Figure 5.2, on the left-
hand side, we can see the
corresponding delta values
for the AAPL call option
strike prices from $375.00 up
to $430.00. At point 1, we
see the strike prices with a
delta of 0.70 or higher (the
$395.00 call has a delta of
0.69, which is close enough).
These are for the recently

                    PAGE 1166                     
==================================================

introduced September
weekly option series, which
have 2 days left till
expiration. As a side note, up
until recently, all stock
options traded monthly,
expiring the third Friday of
every month. Now we also
have “weekly options” on
some of the bigger names,
like AAPL and AMZN.
These options have a very
high premium because—you
guessed it—retail traders are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1167                     
==================================================

clamoring to buy these
“cheap” options. I would
never buy one, ever, ever,
ever. But I’m happy to sell
them to anyone who thinks
she’s getting a bargain.
A glance at point 4 shows
the deltas for the monthly
options, which expire in 23
days. Note that the delta
levels are not the same for
each strike price. The further
out the expiration, the deeper



==================================================
                    PAGE 1168                     
==================================================

in the money a trader needs
to go in order to achieve a
delta of 0.70. At point 3, we
see the delta levels for the
out-of-the-money options,
which fall precipitously the
further away from the current
price we move. That is, a
trader could buy the $430.00
call option for a nickel, and if
AAPL moved $10.00 a share
the next day, the option price
would barely budge. For put
options, the story is the same,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1169                     
==================================================

just in reverse. The delta
levels we want for puts are –
0.70 or greater, as
highlighted at point 5.

==================================================

Figure 5.3
I’m the first to admit that
purely directional plays
aren’t sexy. They are just
simple, and they work. Let’s
take a look at Figure 5.3,
which details one of my
favorite “short-term swing
trading strategies” in options.
By short-term, I mean a trade
that I’m generally in for one
to three days. For these types
of trades, I look at hourly



==================================================
                    PAGE 1172                     
==================================================

charts, and one of my
favorite setups on the hourly
charts is a “squeeze.”
1. At point 1, a squeeze
sets up on the
hourly chart of GS
(Goldman Sachs),
as indicated by the
darker-colored dots
within the square.
When the dots turn
back to lighter-
colored, the trade is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1173                     
==================================================

a buy if the
histogram is above
zero and a sell
(short) if the
histogram is below
zero (note: there is
more about the
squeeze in a later
chapter). In this
case, it’s a buy.
2. At point 2, GS is
trading near
$159.00. I want to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1174                     
==================================================

buy calls, as the
squeeze has
generated a buy
signal. Of course, I
want to go for a
delta 0.70 call,
which in this case
turns out to be the
155 strike price. I
buy over the course
of the next hour at
prices of $7.25,
$7.35, and $7.40.
I’m willing to risk a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1175                     
==================================================

move of $2.00
against me on the
underlying stock, at
which point I would
close out the options
at their current
price. With a delta
of 0.70, I already
know that means
that the option
would drop about
$1.40 if the stock
dropped $2.00.



==================================================

==================================================

Figure 5.4
3. At point 3, the
squeeze indicator
has issued a sell
signal, as the move
has started to lose
momentum. This is
indicated by the
darker-colored
histogram. As a
result, I start closing
out this position at
point 4.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1178                     
==================================================

4. For this particular
trade, as seen in
Figure 5.4, I scaled
into 300 contracts at
prices of $7.25,
$7.35, and $7.40. I
then scaled out of
these 300 contracts
at prices of $9.05
and $9.25, for an
average profit of
$1.85 (+$185.00)
per contract. This
trade was done



==================================================
                    PAGE 1179                     
==================================================

during one of our
quarterly live
trading mentorships,
so I was able to take
screen shots of it as
the trade unfolded.
The main idea here is that
when I’m looking for a stock
to move a few dollars, I want
my option to move up as
much in lockstep with that
price movement as possible.
With a delta of 0.70, a $2.60



==================================================
                    PAGE 1180                     
==================================================

move in GS resulted in a
$1.85 move in the price of
the option. I’m more than
happy to buy an option for
$7.30 on Thursday (GS
October 155 call) and sell it
for $9.20 on Friday. There is
no need to hold it to
expiration to “see what
happens” or hope that the
option will quadruple in
value. I buy based on an
underlying signal in the
stock, and then close out the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1181                     
==================================================

option based on an
underlying signal in the
stock.
And that’s the last point
on this trade. Most of the
literature on options talks
about buying or selling an
option and “holding it until
expiration.” I rarely do that.
As traders, it is perfectly
okay to make a living
practicing what I call
BASAARP: buying and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1182                     
==================================================

selling at a reasonable price.
For more advanced
options traders, there are of
course a couple of ways to
play this GS trading signal.
The signal gives a high
probability that the “stock
will move up a point or two.”
Traders who are more
familiar with option
strategies could also initiate a
variety of spreads on this
position, some of which I’ll



==================================================
                    PAGE 1183                     
==================================================

talk about shortly.
This list could go on and
on, but hopefully you get the
idea. The key is first having a
clean signal on the
underlying stock, and then
stepping in with option
strategies in an attempt to
leverage that move. For the
most part, I’m fine with a
pure directional move, where
I just buy a delta 0.70 option
and exit that same option



==================================================
                    PAGE 1184                     
==================================================

based on the underlying
movement of the stock. It’s
simple and clean.
The Importance of Implied
Volatility Crush, or “Look,
Ma, They’re Panicking!”
The biggest mistake newer
option traders make is not
understanding the role of
implied volatility (IV) and
how it affects the price of an
option. Although a portion of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1185                     
==================================================

the option price is calculated
based on the underlying
stock, another significant
portion of the price is based
on its implied volatility.
Have you ever bought a call
option on AAPL the day
before earnings, watched
AAPL trade $20.00 higher
overnight, and then been
unable to sleep because you
were mentally counting all
the money you were about to
make at the open? Then, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1186                     
==================================================

next day, you looked on in
horror as your option actually
opened lower in price than
where you bought it, and you
ended up losing money on
the trade instead? WTF?
Welcome to the world of
implied volatility.
In this case, the market
makers know that the
earnings report is going to be
a high-volatility event, so
they price the options much



==================================================
                    PAGE 1187                     
==================================================

higher to account for this
anticipated volatility. In other
words, they are pricing in the
expected stock movement. If
a trader bought AAPL calls
the day before earnings, then
the earnings report came and
went, and AAPL opened the
next day at about the same
price where it had closed, the
options price would actually
open much lower, even
though the stock didn’t move
from the day before. The



==================================================
                    PAGE 1188                     
==================================================

reason for this is that the
event that caused the price
gouge has now disappeared.
And once that happens, the
options price gets crushed.
Hence the term IV crush.
Implied volatility
increases with panic,
uncertainty, or a looming big
event. Implied volatility
decreases right after those
events, and also remains low
when there is nothing on the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1189                     
==================================================

horizon to be worried about.
For example, implied
volatility on AAPL options is
currently around 35 percent
(this is a number that is
available on most option
trading platforms). Right
before earnings, this can
jump to 100 percent, which
essentially triples the
premium portion of the
options price. In general, a
trader wants to buy options
only when implied volatility



==================================================
                    PAGE 1190                     
==================================================

is low. If implied volatility
gets too high, it’s really a
losing proposition to buy the
option, though it does
become attractive to sell
(more on that in a bit).
Just how important is
implied volatility? Here is a
story courtesy of Jeff Roth,
from our office. During the
1987 crash, when the stock
market dropped 20 percent
(that is like the Dow



==================================================
                    PAGE 1191                     
==================================================

dropping more than 2,300.00
points in one day in 2011, a
total and utter panic), some
of the floor traders who
owned call options on the
market actually made money.
Uh, say that again? Aren’t
calls supposed to make
money only when the
markets go up? Yes, but if
the implied volatility
explodes, it increases the
price of all options. On that
day it exploded to an



==================================================
                    PAGE 1192                     
==================================================

unprecedented level … to the
point that even the call
options, the very options that
should have collapsed in
value, made money.
Here is one way a trader
can utilize this knowledge to
her advantage. Figure 5.5
shows an hourly chart of GS
(Goldman Sachs). On August
18, 2011, the stock gapped
down more than $3.00 per
share. A “gap down” event is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1193                     
==================================================

a situation where some panic
ensues at the open. People
who own GS panic to buy
puts to protect themselves,
and the gap itself creates
uncertainty in the market.
There is a window of about 5
to 10 minutes at the open
when the put option prices
are artificially high because
of all this—in other words,
the implied volatility
increases. It pops at the open,
and the premium price of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1194                     
==================================================

option expands accordingly.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1195                     
==================================================

                    PAGE 1196                     
==================================================

Figure 5.5
The thing about gap
downs is that most of the
news is already in the price
once the stock opens. After
the gap down and the initial
flurry of activity, a stock will
often spend the rest of the
day trading in a choppy,
quiet range. As things quiet
down, the implied volatility
drops … and so does the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1197                     
==================================================

price of the options. This is
called an implied volatility
(IV) crush. And there is a
way to take advantage of
this.
In this particular trade, we
aren’t looking to buy puts;
we are looking to sell them to
someone who is panicking.
Since this person is
panicking, he will pay up to
buy the puts. We will gladly
sell those puts to him, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1198                     
==================================================

then buy them back when the
market quiets down. The
trade goes like this:
1. About half an hour
before the cash open
at 9:30 p.m. eastern,
I scan for stocks that
are gapping down of
their own accord.
This is mostly due
to a news event
specific to that
stock. In Figure 5.5,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1199                     
==================================================

we can see at point
1 that we have a
nice gap down in
GS from the
previous day’s
close.
2. Within a few
minutes after the
open, I sell puts that
are one strike out of
the money
(remember, we want
to buy in-the-money



==================================================
                    PAGE 1200                     
==================================================

options but sell out-
of-the-money
options). In this
case, GS opened at
$114.07 and quickly
traded lower. The
first out-of-the-
money puts are the
$110.00 strike, and I
sell these at current
market prices at
point 2.
3. The goal with this



==================================================
                    PAGE 1201                     
==================================================

trade is to then close
it out that day. As
we near the close at
point 3, GS rallies
back toward the
$114.00 level. At
this point, the
uncertainty is no
longer there, and the
implied volatility
gets “crushed” back
to what it had been
the day before. The
option that I sold for



==================================================
                    PAGE 1202                     
==================================================

$1.20 drops back
down to $0.60 by
the close, even
though the stock
hasn’t really moved
since the open.
4. For stop losses, I’m
looking at a 1:1
risk/reward ratio.
That is, if I’m
looking to make
$1.00, then I am
willing to risk



==================================================
                    PAGE 1203                     
==================================================

$1.00. It’s important
to figure out a stop,
because there will
be instances where
the stock could just
keep falling. Selling
a naked option is
risky in this regard.
In this case, if GS
kept selling off and
ended up down
$10.00, the option I
sold for $1.50 could
be trading for $5.00



==================================================
                    PAGE 1204                     
==================================================

or even higher. (Of
course, I could also
buy the next strike
out-of-the-money
put as protection
against this
situation.) As a
seller in this case,
any price over $1.50
represents a loss,
and it’s wise not to
let that loss get
carried away. This
is why selling naked



==================================================
                    PAGE 1205                     
==================================================

calls and holding
them overnight is
inherently
dangerous; it is the
riskiest option
strategy alive. If a
trader sells 20 naked
call options at $5.00
(collecting
$10,000.00) on a
stock, and then
wakes up the next
morning to see that
the stock is up



==================================================
                    PAGE 1206                     
==================================================

$80.00 a share on a
takeover, then that
trader is hosed. That
option is now worth
$160,000.00, and
the guy who sold it
has just lost
$150,000.00. This is
where “verticals”
and “credit spreads”
come into play,
because they protect
an option seller
against a “takeover



==================================================
                    PAGE 1207                     
==================================================

situation.”
To summarize, if I’m
buying options, I try to avoid
buying them when IV is
high. This is typically right
after a huge move (wow,
AAPL is up $10.00 today—
I’d better buy some out-of-
the-money calls!) and right
before earnings. I’d rather
wait for a “quiet period” to
buy options, such as a
squeeze play, which forms



==================================================
                    PAGE 1208                     
==================================================

when a market is quiet.
However, high IV does give
a trader the opportunity to
sell options. For example,
back in the day, there was a
period of several years when
every time IBM approached
$280.00, it would then sell
off. Thus, every time IBM
approached this level, the
floor traders would sell
naked the $280.00 call
options on IBM and collect
the extremely high premium.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1209                     
==================================================

Of course, the retail traders
who bought these call
options (hoping that IBM
would blast through $280.00)
got hosed. The saying for
years was, “Sell the 80s and
buy a Mercedes.” This party
ended the day IBM finally
broke through $280.00 and
kept on going.
In the GS example, I sold
“naked” puts (they weren’t
backed by underlying stock)



==================================================
                    PAGE 1210                     
==================================================

at a high IV, and bought
them back when the IV
normalized.
How Do You Know When
to Hold ‘Em and When to
Spread ‘Em?
When you’re trading options,
you have two choices: buy an
in-the-money option during a
quiet IV period for a
directional play, or sell
options during high-IV



==================================================
                    PAGE 1211                     
==================================================

periods. As we have already
seen, selling naked options is
riskier than buying options,
even though they have a
higher probability of working
in our favor. When buying an
option, we are limited to
losing only the amount we
paid for the option. If we sell
a naked call, our loss is
theoretically unlimited, as the
stock could go to infinity. Of
course, I have yet to see a
stock do that, but in theory it



==================================================
                    PAGE 1212                     
==================================================

could happen.
Other than an IV crush
situation, the main reason to
sell options, especially out-
of-the-money options, is that
they are literally losing
premium value each and
every day. Think of the
premium portion of the
option as a bright, juicy
peach … covered with ants.
Every day those ants are
going to work on that peach,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1213                     
==================================================

little by little, stripping away
the flesh, until at some point
there is nothing left but the
seed in the middle. This
happens all the way to
options expiration until the
premium portion of the
option price is zero, and all
that’s left is the real or
intrinsic value of the option.
If that option is out of the
money, then it expires
worthless.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1214                     
==================================================

This premium decay is
actually measured by theta,
which is one of the “Greeks”
that is readily available on
most option platforms. If a
call option is trading at
$11.50 (total value is
$1,150.00) and the theta is
53.80, then this option is
losing $53.80 in premium
each and every day. That is,
the $11.50 option is losing
more than 50 cents per day
just in premium. To put this



==================================================
                    PAGE 1215                     
==================================================

in perspective, if the
underlying stock traded
sideways for three days and
didn’t budge in price, this
option price would plummet
to $10.00, a loss of $150.00
per contract, even though the
stock hasn’t budged. If this
option had a delta of 0.50,
then the stock would have to
move up $1.00 a day just to
keep this option at the same
price. Even more brutal, if
the stock drops $2.00 today,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1216                     
==================================================

but has a fierce $3.00 rally
the next day, your option is
back at … merely breakeven.
The closer an option gets to
expiration, the higher the
theta— that is, the faster the
premium erodes. This is
critical to keep in mind, and
it’s why buying far-out-of-
the-money call options a few
weeks out from expiration is
such a low-probability event.
And that is also why



==================================================
                    PAGE 1217                     
==================================================

selling options is so
attractive. They literally lose
value each and every day.
The only problem in selling
them is that the risk of loss is
great should the stock have a
big move against you. You
could literally have 15
winning trades in a row and
then get wiped out on the
sixteenth trade. The way
around this risk is to initiate
what is called a vertical
spread. Spreads are attractive



==================================================
                    PAGE 1218                     
==================================================

because a trader doesn’t have
to be “dead right” in order to
make money on the trade.
I’m not going to spend a lot
of time on this concept
because there are entire
books written on the subject.
Let’s take a quick look.
If we revisit the GS trade
from Figure 5.3, I could have
initiated a bullish vertical
spread on this trade to lessen
the risk. I could have still



==================================================
                    PAGE 1219                     
==================================================

purchased the $155 calls at
$7.30, but instead of having a
$2.00 stop based on the
underlying movement of the
stock, I could at the same
time have sold the same
amount of $160 calls at the
then-current price of $3.80.
Remember, this out-of-the-
money call is all premium,
and the ants are eating away
daily at that juicy peach. It is
losing value each day.
Because of this, had the GS



==================================================
                    PAGE 1220                     
==================================================

position traded sideways for
a few days, I could still have
closed out the position for a
small profit, making money
on the premium erosion. I
could also have
1. Legged into the same
spread as described
earlier, instead of
initiating it all at
once. That is, I
could have bought
in-the-money calls



==================================================
                    PAGE 1221                     
==================================================

initially, and then,
when the squeeze
signal finished the
next day, stepped in
and sold out-of-the-
money calls. Once
the signal finishes, a
stock will generally
trade sideways for a
few days. The small
price spurt gooses
the IV, thereby
increasing the
pricing on the out-



==================================================
                    PAGE 1222                     
==================================================

of-the-money calls.
In other words, it’s
a good time to sell
them. Ideally, the
stock then trades
sideways for a few
days, and I’m able
to close out both
legs of the trade for
a profit.
2. Sold a naked at-the-
money or one strike
out-of-the-money



==================================================
                    PAGE 1223                     
==================================================

put, buying it back
when the squeeze
signal was done.
The risk with this is
if GS receives bad
news (for example,
an SEC
investigation) and
drops $20.00 a share
quickly, this trade
can get very ugly
very fast.
3. Initiated a vertical



==================================================
                    PAGE 1224                     
==================================================

bull put credit
spread. Once the
squeeze signaled a
long trade, I could
have sold an at-the-
money put and then
bought an out-of-
the-money put. This
is similar to strategy
2, except that now I
have downside
protection in the
event of a disaster.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1225                     
==================================================

This list could go on and
on. The more a person knows
about option strategies, the
more she can do with this,
but I want to emphasize that
it’s not necessary to make
this that complicated.
With the advent of weekly
options on some of the
highly liquid stocks such as
AAPL and AMZN, a unique
opportunity has been created.
I personally like to buy an in-



==================================================
                    PAGE 1226                     
==================================================

the-money monthly option,
and then each week initiate a
vertical spread by selling an
out-of-the-money weekly
option against it. There are
times when a trader can sell a
weekly option each week for
three or four weeks and have
it expire worthless each
week. During this entire
time, the trader can still hold
on to the monthly option, and
end up closing it out for a
gain as well. It’s the best of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1227                     
==================================================

both worlds. Holding a deep-
in-the-money option is like
owning a piece of real estate.
Selling the weekly options
against it is like collecting
rent on your property each
and every week. It beats
working for a living.
A final note for those of
you who are interested in
commodity options: these
take a while to get your arms
wrapped around if you aren’t



==================================================
                    PAGE 1228                     
==================================================

used to them. Whereas one
stock option represents 100
shares of stock, one
commodity option represents
just one futures contract. For
pricing, just take the current
price and multiply it by the
multiplier of the underlying
futures contract. For
example, if you see that an
at-the-money call option on
the E-mini S&P 500 is
trading at 52.25, then
multiply 52.25 × $50.00 (the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1229                     
==================================================

per point price), and you get
a price of $2,612.50. This
means it would cost you that
much to buy the call option,
which represents one futures
contract. Of course, you
could buy the actual futures
contract for about the same
price. This is why I’m not
crazy about futures options.
You might as well just buy
the actual futures contract.
Commodity options do have
their place. They are good for



==================================================
                    PAGE 1230                     
==================================================

hedging a futures position,
and also for anticipated
bigger moves (like a weekly
squeeze, as discussed in
Chapter 11), where it makes
sense to buy an out-of-the-
money option. Otherwise I’ll
tend to stick to the actual
futures contract.
Now that we understand
how all these different
futures and options markets
work and the trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1231

represent, it’s time to move

to do with stocks such as
SPY (Standard & Poor’s
Depositary Receipts for the
S&P 500), options on SPY,
or even individual stocks,
this is the most important
chapter in the book. Not
understanding the material in
this chapter and then going
on to trade these instruments
intraday is like not knowing
how to swim and then trying
to qualify for the 100-meter
backstroke. Although I will

==================================================

swing-trade almost anything,
a large percentage of my
intraday trading is confined
to instruments that reflect the
movement of the stock
indexes. There is a good
reason for this—there is a ton
of data available during the
trading day that will show a
trader what is happening
behind the scenes in the
stock markets. By
understanding how to read
and interpret these data, a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1238                     
==================================================

trader will have a better feel
of whether the predominant
pressure in the markets is on
the buy side or the sell side
and can make trading
decisions accordingly. There
are plenty of traders out there
who have only the vaguest
idea of how to interpret these
tools, and an even larger
group of newbies that has no
clue that they even exist.
This represents a large pool
of cash that is ripe for the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1239                     
==================================================

plucking, and knowledge of
this information gets traders
closer to the front of the
handout line.
There is another critical
reason for thoroughly
understanding this material.
Every single trading day is
going to present both setups
on the long side and setups
on the short side. By
understanding how to
interpret these internals



==================================================
                    PAGE 1240                     
==================================================

accurately, a trader will
know the following:
• Which days to ignore all
short setups
• Which days to ignore all
long setups
• Which days to focus on
setups that do best in
choppy markets
• Which days to focus on
setups that do best in
trending markets



==================================================
                    PAGE 1241                     
==================================================

This knowledge is critical
and has a big impact on
whether a trader is going to
have a winning day or a
losing day, and, as the weeks
and months progress, an

or something that’s, well,
less amusing to your spouse.
Let’s get started.
How Do You Track
Institutional Trading?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1242                     
==================================================

The NYSE (New York Stock
Exchange) ticks
(TradeStation symbol
$TICK) summarize the
number of stocks on the
NYSE that are increasing in
price versus the number that
are decreasing in price from
the previous price quote.
Many times this is not purely
buying and selling, as an
uptick may indicate only that
the ask was hit, while a
downtick may indicate only



==================================================
                    PAGE 1243                     
==================================================

that a bid was hit. This type
of information is like
learning that James LeBron
is holding another press
conference. In other words—
who cares? Yet I’ve watched
traders stare at the ticks,
mesmerized by a move from
–300 ticks to +200 ticks, and
think this was a positive
thing for the markets. In
reality, this type of move is
not positive—it’s immaterial,
and the information is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1244                     
==================================================

useless. This brings us to the
first rule I follow when
watching the ticks:
Any tick reading that
is below +400 or
above –400 is noise
and should be
ignored.
I start paying attention to
the ticks whenever readings
are over +600 or under –600.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1245                     
==================================================

These types of moves tell me
that there is sustained buying
or selling pressure hitting the
markets. This doesn’t signal
any actions on my part, but it
does give me a heads-up. If
the ticks continue to move
and hit +800 or –800, this
does trigger specific action
on my part, because only a
sustained buying or selling
program can move the ticks
to this level. This brings us to
my next rule in using the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1246                     
==================================================

ticks for day trading:
If I’m long intraday
and my stop hasn’t
been hit and the
markets generate a –
800 tick reading, I
will close out my
position at the
market. Similarly, if
I’m short and the
markets generate a
tick reading of +800



==================================================
                    PAGE 1247                     
==================================================

and my stop hasn’t
been hit, I will close
out my position at
the market.
Readings this high are
telling the traders loud and
clear that, on an intraday
basis, they are either right or
wrong, depending on their
position. If I’m short, and the
market is telling me that I’m
wrong through a +800 tick
reading, I take the hint and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1248                     
==================================================

close out my trade. This also
has the nice benefit of
increasing a trader’s
risk/reward ratio, as it is
possible in many instances to
get out of trades early that
would otherwise have been
stopped out for the maximum
loss. This technique applies
to shorter-term trading on 5-
minute charts or less.
I want to make one thing
perfectly clear before I move



==================================================
                    PAGE 1249                     
==================================================

on: I never exit a trade early
just because “I think I’m
wrong.” I have learned the
hard way over many years of
trading to stick to my
original parameters—unless I
have designated a specific,
measurable event that alerts
me to get out of the trade
early. A reading of +800 or –
800 ticks is one of these
specific events. My deciding
to get out of a trade early has
nothing to do with gut feel or



==================================================
                    PAGE 1250                     
==================================================

interpretation—I’ve already
discussed in Chapter 2 how
woefully inadequate human
beings are at making
objective decisions while
they’re in a trade. Luckily,
there is no way around a tick
reading of +800 or –800.
Either the markets hit that
level or they don’t. There is
no emotion involved.
I’m emphasizing this
point because I’ve had the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1251                     
==================================================

opportunity to sit next to
many traders who come to
visit me at my trading office.
We trade next to each other,
side by side, for one week.
For the first two days, it’s
straightforward and low key.
I do my trades; they do their
trades. It may seem relaxed
and laid back, but there is a
very specific reason I do this
—I can learn more about
people in one day by
watching them trade live,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1252                     
==================================================

with their own money, than I
can learn about them through
normal conversations over
the course of five years. In
mere talking, people put their
best face forward—the image
that they think they are or
should be. However, when
their money is on the line,
this façade lasts about 12
minutes, and then the
underlying, dominant
personality springs forth.
Sometimes this ain’t pretty.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1253                     
==================================================

In working with this many
other traders, I’ve seen
firsthand the reason that most
people never make it in this
business. In the final
analysis, most traders are
atrocious at managing their
exits. This is indisputably the
one thing that prevents most
people from making a living
as a trader. To put it simply,
many traders manage their
exits based on how they feel
about the trade. Worse, if



==================================================
                    PAGE 1254                     
==================================================

they are down on the day,
they will manage trades
differently from the way they
do when they are up on the
day (because, of course, they
want to be “right” and make
money on the day), and they
don’t even realize this. To
illustrate this point, there are
many times when I will take
a trade, and they will take it
with me. We will get into the
same trade at exactly the
same time, and five minutes



==================================================
                    PAGE 1255                     
==================================================

later, I will see them selling
out half their position. Of
course, I’m perplexed by this
because they said, “JC, I’m
going with you on this next
trade.” The ensuing
conversation goes something
like this.
Me: Steve, I thought you
said you were going to
follow me on this one.
Did you just sell some of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1256                     
==================================================

your position?
Steve: Uh, well, no, I …
Me: I heard the software
execution platform say
“sell.”
Steve: Oh, that, yeah,
well, I’m selling some
here to book gains.
Me: Why?
Steve: Didn’t you say it
was a good idea to scale



==================================================
                    PAGE 1257                     
==================================================

out of your position as it
goes your way?
Me: Yes, but I said only
if you had a specific exit
strategy. You can’t exit a
trade based on your gut
feelings. So why did you
sell?
Steve: Uh, the ticks were
going higher, and I
wanted to sell into
strength.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1258                     
==================================================

Me: The ticks are only at
+200.
Steve: But they were at
+284.
This goes on for some
time. As a matter of faith, I
let these traders try to
convince me that they are
justified in their actions, but
my eventual goal is to get
them to admit to what they
are doing—selling because



==================================================
                    PAGE 1259                     
==================================================

they are nervous or scared or
excited or whatever, and that
surge of emotion is what
made them push the button.
In other words, there was
absolutely no rational reason
for them to take the action
that they did.
Trading is an extremely
private world for most
people, with friends and
spouses kept totally in the
dark about the emotional ups



==================================================
                    PAGE 1260                     
==================================================

and downs that traders feel
and experience each and
every trading day. Getting a
trader to admit to what’s
really going on internally is
like trying to pry open a
walnut with your fingers. It’s
challenging because most
traders are masters at
masking what they are really
feeling. Whether a trader is
up $25,000 or down $25,000,
many times the outside world
will never know. I’ve been



==================================================
                    PAGE 1261                     
==================================================

there, and I know the feeling.
Armed with this knowledge,
I go on the “friendly attack”
and eventually get most of
them to fess up. I don’t pull
any punches. I tell them that
no one is ever going to
understand their trading
journey like another trader.
Speak now or be stuck in
your rut forever. Usually this
works, and it gets traders to
open up and confront their
trading demons—trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1262                     
==================================================

therapy 101. Let’s look at the
rest of the tick reading rules
that I follow.
The next thing I’m
looking for in the ticks is if
they hit +1,000 or –1,000.
This is the most important
reading of the day for two
reasons. First, it usually
represents the maximum
amount of sustained buying
or selling pressure that the
market can handle. It’s like a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1263                     
==================================================

sprinter getting to the end of
a 100-yard dash and having
to stop and gasp for breath.
Second, it represents a
specific new trading
opportunity. These extreme
readings set up a “fade” play
that I follow. If we get a
reading of +1,000 ticks, I
will set up a short. If we get a
reading of –1,000 ticks, I will
set up a long. I discuss this
play in detail in Chapter 9.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1264                     
==================================================

This brings me to the next
rule I use with the ticks:
If I am long and the
markets hit +1,000
ticks, I will use that
as a signal to exit the
remainder of my
position. If I am
short and the
markets hit –1,000
ticks, I will use that
as a signal to exit the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1265                     
==================================================

remainder of my
position.
Figure 6.1 is a snapshot of
the ticks from March 29,
2005. This is how I have
them set up on my
TradeStation charts. I use a
five-minute chart, but the
interval is not important—the
key for me is that I want to
be able to see a full trading
day’s worth of data. (Side
note—all the charts you see



==================================================
                    PAGE 1266                     
==================================================

in this book have a white
background. This is for
printing purposes. When I’m
watching these on the screen,
I set the background to black,
and the chart colors are
usually blue or green for up
moves and red for down
moves.)

                    PAGE 1267                     
==================================================

                    PAGE 1268                     
==================================================

Figure 6.1
In this chart, we can see at
points 1 and 2 that there are
horizontal lines placed at
+1,200, +1,000, +800, and
+600 ticks, and also at –
1,200, –1,000, –800, and –
600 ticks. These horizontal
lines serve a very specific
purpose, which brings me to
my fourth rule in using ticks:



==================================================
                    PAGE 1269                     
==================================================

I set up audio alerts
at all the key tick
levels. This way I
don’t have to stare at
the chart, and I never
miss a move.
These audio alerts are a
key part of my trading plan. I
can be on the phone, down
the hall, or in the bathroom,
and I will hear if the ticks
make a move. Remember
that at the 800 and 1,000



==================================================
                    PAGE 1270                     
==================================================

levels, I take action, so I
don’t want to miss them, no
matter what I’m doing. Yes,
there have been times when
I’ve had to initiate a new
trade with my pants around
my ankles, as I’m stumbling
out of the bathroom. I spend
a lot of time staring at
computers, so I like to make
these alerts halfway
entertaining. When the ticks
hit +1,000, I hear Daffy
Duck screaming, “I’m rich!



==================================================
                    PAGE 1271                     
==================================================

I’m rich!” and when the ticks
hit –1,000, I hear the Wicked
Witch from the Wizard of Oz
crying, “I’m melting! I’m
melting!” Visiting traders
raise their eyebrows when
these alerts first start to hit,
but they get their attention—
which is the whole idea.
I want to point out that I
specifically use a bar chart or
a candlestick chart for
anything having to do with



==================================================
                    PAGE 1272                     
==================================================

audio alerts. Another popular
chart, the “line on close,” is
also good when watching the
ticks, because it helps to
show a trader when they are
rolling over or “hooking.”
However, these types of
charts can, and do, miss
many audio alerts because
the line is literally created on
the close of the bar and
misses the high and low
fluctuations—which is what
sets off the audio alerts.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1273

==================================================

Figure 6.2
In this chart, we can see
that at point 3, the ticks hit
+800. On this day, I had a
short in the mini-sized Dow
with a 20-point stop. When
the ticks hit +800, I covered
my short for a 9-point loss.
When the ticks hit +1,000
ticks 25 minutes later, I heard
the audio alert for this level,
and I set up a new short in
the YM. (This is a trade



==================================================
                    PAGE 1275                     
==================================================

setup that is covered in
Chapter 9.)
Between about 10:30 a.m.
EST and 12:30 p.m. EST,
nothing happened. The ticks
were twitching back and
forth like a freshly caught
tuna on a boat deck. At
around 1:30 p.m., the action
picked up enough to the
point where the ticks
registered a reading of –800,
and they even hit –1,000 later



==================================================
                    PAGE 1276                     
==================================================

in the day. Let’s take a look
at this same chart with the
actual market action overlaid
on top of it (see Figure 6.2).
1. The ticks are usually
quiet at the open,
and at point 1 we
can see that the ticks
just flopped back
and forth for the
better part of an
hour. The markets
did a whole lot of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1277                     
==================================================

nothing during this
time.
2. By 10:25 a.m., we
get the first notable
tick reading at +600,
and this drives the
markets higher, with
the ticks eventually
hitting +1,000.
(Remember, this is a
shorting opportunity
that is discussed
later in the book.)



==================================================
                    PAGE 1278                     
==================================================

3. The mini-sized Dow
futures hit 10,542
when the ticks move
over +1,000, and
this ends up being
their dead highs of
the day.
4. I like to watch how
the markets react
when the ticks start
stair-stepping and
making higher highs
or higher lows. The



==================================================
                    PAGE 1279                     
==================================================

ticks shot up to
+600 at around
12:00 noon EST,
but the markets did
not move higher.
Yet when the ticks
started making
lower lows, so did
the market. This is
key information. If
high ticks of over
+600 can’t move the
markets higher, then
that is a tip-off that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1280                     
==================================================

the selling pressure
is predominant.
5. This series of lower
lows in the ticks
leads to an eventual
steep sell-off. The
market generally
works up to
“abrupt” rallies or
sell-offs—the ticks
can clue a trader as
to which way the
“out of the blue”



==================================================
                    PAGE 1281                     
==================================================

move is likely to be.
6. Here we see the ticks
make higher highs,
forming an uptrend.
7. Yet when the ticks
made higher highs,
the YM made lower
highs. This is a
bearish divergence
and a signal that the
rally can be sold
because there isn’t



==================================================
                    PAGE 1282                     
==================================================

enough “juice” to
get things rolling.
There are rare days when
the markets rocket higher and
keep on going, or gap down
and keep on selling. On these
days, consistent extreme tick
readings are generated,
usually in the neighborhood
of 1,200 to 1,400. These
consistent high readings are
rare, but when they happen, I
don’t fight them. This brings



==================================================
                    PAGE 1283                     
==================================================

me to my last rule regarding
the ticks—this is something
that I take into account after
10:30 a.m. EST and watch
throughout the day:
When the ticks
spend 90 percent of
their time above zero
with repeated
extreme high tick
readings, I ignore
trading short setups



==================================================
                    PAGE 1284                     
==================================================

all day and focus on
longs. When the
ticks spend 90
percent of their time
below zero with
repeated extreme
low tick readings, I
ignore trading long
setups all day and
focus on shorts.
The ticks are a great way
to see what is going on
“underneath” the price



==================================================
                    PAGE 1285                     
==================================================

action. The charts can tell
you if prices are going higher
or lower, but they can’t tell
you if the buying or selling
pressure is merely fleeting or
unrelenting. Leave that job to
the ticks. As an update to this
chapter, I’ve found that I’ve
increasingly been using this
indicator in more and more
of my day trading. On days
when the ticks are repeatedly
hitting +1,000, I will use any
pullbacks to the 0.00 line as



==================================================
                    PAGE 1286                     
==================================================

buy entry opportunities. The
opposite is also true. On any
days when the selling is brisk
and we are getting repeated –
1,000 tick readings, I will use
any rallies in the ticks back
to the 0.00 line as shorting
opportunities. Even better,
these tick readings help a
trader to stay in a trend. For
example, if I’m short, and
each time the ticks rally back
to 0.00, they get pushed back
down, I’ll just stay short until



==================================================
                    PAGE 1287                     
==================================================

we get a +600 reading. The
opposite, of course, is also
true. This is imperative on
those occasional runaway
days where the S&Ps are up
or down 30 or more points,
as has been the case for much
of August and September
2011.
What Is the Fastest Heads-
Up That Stocks Are About
to Make a Move?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1288                     
==================================================

The tiki (TradeStation
symbol $TIKI) is similar to
the ticks, but it measures the
net upticks versus downticks
on the 30 Dow stocks instead
of the entire NYSE. Because
this reading follows only 30
stocks, it is the first thing that
fires off when a buy or sell
program hits the markets.
(See Figure 6.3.)



==================================================
                    PAGE 1289                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 1290                     
==================================================

Figure 6.3
Tiki charts are filled with
noise, and at first glance they
look useless to watch. The
key with them, however, is to
set up alerts in the same
fashion as for the ticks. On
the tiki, I set up alerts to fire
off at +26, +28, and +30 on
the upside, and –26, –28, and
–30 on the downside. When
buy or sell programs hit the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1291                     
==================================================

markets, these alerts fire off
instantly. In general, small
programs generate the 26
level, medium programs hit
the 28 level, and massive
programs hit the 30 level—
meaning that all 30 Dow
stocks are moving in the
same direction. These
readings are rare and
highlight significant and
sustained periods of buying
or selling.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1292                     
==================================================

Surprisingly, I don’t use
these signals for any
actionable exit strategies. If
I’m short, and a +28 tiki
level is generated, I’m
probably wrong on the move,
but I will wait until the ticks
get to +800 before I exit.
This is because a buy or sell
program can be swift and
over in a blink, causing the
tiki movement to be erratic.
This brings me to my first

For exits, tiki
readings are only the
heads-up; ticks are
the confirmation.
Figure 6.4 shows the tikis
on March 29, 2005. When
comparing this to the ticks,
the first thing that is evident
is that the tiki looks like it’s
all over the place and hard to
read. However, upon closer

inspection, immense value
can be found.
1. I always like to see
what type of
program hits the
market first—a buy
or a sell program.
This represents the
first real “try” of the
day, and I want to
see how it pans out.
In this chart, the
first program of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1295                     
==================================================

day is a buy
program that hits at
10:25 a.m. EST.
2. This sends the Dow
to new highs.
3. The next program is
also a buy, and it
hits at 11:30 a.m.

Figure 6.4
4. However, this time
the Dow does not
make new highs, but
in fact continues to
drift lower. This is a
heads-up that “even
a buy program” is
not able to move the
market higher.
5. There is another buy
program at 12:45



==================================================
                    PAGE 1298                     
==================================================

p.m., and this one is
after the first sell
program hit the
markets.
6. This buy program
causes a small pop
in the markets, but
this buying dries up
quickly.
7. At points 7, 8, 9, and
10, a series of sell
programs hits the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1299                     
==================================================

market, and each
time a sell program
hits, the markets
make new lows.
When this happens,
the next opposing
signal is a fading
opportunity.
8. At point 11 there is
an opposing signal
with a buy program
—an opportunity to
go short.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1300                     
==================================================

This brings me to the next
and last rule I use in
following the tiki:
If buy programs are
driving the markets
to new highs, then
the occasional sell
program is a buying
opportunity. If sell
programs are driving
the markets to new
lows, then the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1301                     
==================================================

occasional buy
program is a
shorting opportunity.
I like to see where most of
the programs are hitting. Are
they mostly buy or mostly
sell programs? This is
important, because most of
the time markets are doing
nothing. They are chopping
back and forth. If most of the
programs on the day are buy
programs and these programs



==================================================
                    PAGE 1302                     
==================================================

are pushing the markets up to
new highs, then I want to use
the quiet selling
opportunities to get long.
This way I’m getting into the
market when it’s quiet,
before the next move higher,
instead of chasing it higher.
A good example of a setup
that works well in this
situation is the pivot plays
that I discuss in Chapter 8.
What Is the Best Tool for

==================================================

Reading Buying Versus
Selling Pressure?
The trin (TradeStation
symbol $TRIN), also known
as the Arms Index after its
creator, Richard W. Arms,
measures the relative rate at
which volume is flowing into
advancing or declining
stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange. To calculate
the trin, the following
formula is utilized:



==================================================
                    PAGE 1304                     
==================================================

(advancing issues/declining
issues)/(advancing
volume/declining volume). If
more volume goes into
advancing issues than into
declining issues, the Arms
Index falls below 1.0. If
more volume goes into
declining stocks than into
advancing stocks, the Arms
Index rises above 1.0. Most
educational material on “how
to use the trin” tells traders
that “over 1.0 is bearish, so



==================================================
                    PAGE 1305                     
==================================================

consider shorting, and under
1.0 is bullish, so consider
buying.” That statement is
annoying and misleading,
and it brings me to my first
rule when using the trin:
I don’t care what the
current reading is.
I care about the
current reading only
in relation to where
it has been.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1306                     
==================================================

In other words, what I
care about is not the trin
reading itself, but the trend of
the trin. A reading of 1.50
might seem bearish, but if the
reading started the day at
2.00 and we are now an hour
into the trading day and 1.50
is the low, this is bullish.
This means that volume is
flowing into advancing
issues and that there is
sustained buying pressure in
the markets. Conversely, a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1307                     
==================================================

reading of 0.85 might seem
bullish, but if the reading
started the day at 0.45 and
we are now two hours into
the trading day and 0.85 is
the high, this is bearish. This
means that volume is flowing
into declining issues and that
there is sustained selling
pressure in the markets. Let’s
take a look at Figure 6.5.
1. Figure 6.5 is a shot
of the mini-sized



==================================================
                    PAGE 1308                     
==================================================

Dow on March 29,
2005, the same day
we used for the tick
and the tiki. At
point 1, we can see
that the trin started
the day near 1.40.
The first 15 to 20
minutes are volatile,
as listed issues open
on a delayed basis
on the NYSE.
Because of this, I
dismiss the first



==================================================
                    PAGE 1309                     
==================================================

five-minute bar, but
I like to note the
opening levels
based on the start of
the second five-
minute bar.
2. The trin settles in,
and by 10:40 a.m. it
is trading near its
lows of the day at
0.81.
3. The YM hits its



==================================================
                    PAGE 1310                     
==================================================

highs of the day in
correlation with the
low trin reading.
4. By 12:00 noon, the
trin has been in a
steady uptrend,
making new highs
on the day (after
discounting the first
five-minute bar).
5. The YM is quiet and
choppy, and it is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1311                     
==================================================

trading in the
middle of the day’s
range. However,
even though the
markets are quiet,
the trin continues to
rally. This is the key
action I’m looking
for—which way is
the trin trending? A
trend higher
indicates that
volume is flowing
into declining



==================================================
                    PAGE 1312                     
==================================================

issues, and this
means that when the
market actually does
break, the odds are
strong that it will be
to the downside. As
we can see on the
chart, a little later in
the day, the market
breaks down.



==================================================

==================================================

Figure 6.5
6. The YM tries to rally
here, but it is in
vain, as the trin is
staying in a nice
uptrend. The YM
soon rolls over and
drifts down into the
close.
This brings me to my next
rule for the trin:



==================================================
                    PAGE 1315                     
==================================================

If the trin is trending
higher and making
higher highs on the
day, I will ignore all
long setups.
If the trin is trending
lower and making
lower lows on the
day, I will ignore all
short setups.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1316                     
==================================================

Let’s take a look at
another multiday chart and
the trin action (see Figure
6.6).
Figure 6.6 shows a good
overall representation of
what various trin patterns
mean. On the first day,
February 22, 2005, the trin
started off low. Some would
call this bullish. Yet the trin
then proceeded to rally all
day long, and the Dow fell



==================================================
                    PAGE 1317                     
==================================================

more than 120 points. The
rule of “no longs on this type
of day” serves a trader well.
Conversely, if I am in a short
and the trin is making new
highs, I realize that there is
no reason to cover, as the
eventual market break has a
high probability of being in
my favor.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1318                     
==================================================

==================================================

Figure 6.6
On February 23, 2005, the
trin started off high, but then
proceeded to trend lower all
day long. Although many
traders will get caught up in
the previous day’s selling
and use this initial strength as
a shorting opportunity, they
would realize the folly of this
idea if they knew that they
should follow the trend of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1320                     
==================================================

trin. With the trin heading
lower, the markets stabilized
early in the session, and a
modest rally ensued. Because
the trin continued to make
lower lows on the day, I just
focused on long setups. On
February 24, 2005, the trin
started off high once again,
then proceeded to spend the
rest of the day grinding
lower. Based on this, I
ignored short setups on the
day. The YM broke nicely



==================================================
                    PAGE 1321                     
==================================================

higher later in the day. On
February 25, 2005, the trin
once again started off high
and spent the day working
lower. Finally, on February
28, 2005, the trin started off
high—but moved higher.
While it was making new
highs on the day, I ignored
long setups and focused only
on short setups. During the
last two hours of the trading
day, the trin reversed, and the
markets rallied into the close.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1322                     
==================================================

The most bullish days are
gap ups where the trin starts
off low, say around 0.50, and
stays at that level all day
long. On such a day, it
doesn’t trend lower because
it can go only so low—it
won’t make it to a zero
reading. The sustained lower
reading looks like a
consolidation pattern on a
chart, and it is extremely
bullish. On these types of
days, I ignore all short



==================================================
                    PAGE 1323                     
==================================================

setups, and a breakout to new
highs is a buying
opportunity.
The key with the trin is to
watch to see if it is making
new highs on the day or new
lows on the day. Whenever
this is happening, I just
ignore the opposing setups.
I’ve read that some people
recommend using levels such
as 1.50 as “oversold” and
start looking for a bounce, or



==================================================
                    PAGE 1324                     
==================================================

0.50 as “overbought” and
start looking for a sell-off. I
am not a fan of oversold or
overbought, and I generally
ignore this with most
indicators, and the trin
intraday is no exception. The
biggest rallies take place
when the trin hovers under
0.50 all day long. Just
because something is
overbought doesn’t mean
that it’s going to reverse. For
reversals, I will look only at



==================================================
                    PAGE 1325                     
==================================================

price action, and I discuss
these types of setups in later
chapters.
Although I’m not a big
fan of overbought and
oversold in general and I
don’t worry about
overbought or oversold
readings intraday on the trin,
I will pay attention to where
it closes on the day. This
closing number actually is
valuable when it comes to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1326                     
==================================================

gauging an extreme
overbought or oversold
reading. These readings are
rare and happen about a
dozen times a year, and this
brings me to my next rule
when using the trin:
If the trin closes
above 2.0, the
market has an 80
percent chance of
rallying the next day.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1327                     
==================================================

If the trin closes
below 0.60, the
market has an 80
percent chance of
selling off the next
day.
The moves the next day
won’t necessarily be big
moves, but they will
generally be opposing
moves. I will keep this in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1328                     
==================================================

mind as I’m viewing my
setups the next trading day. If
the previous day’s close was
over 2.0, then the next day
I’m going to focus more on
long setups and ignore short
setups. Here’s where it gets
interesting—if after a 2.0
reading, the markets can’t
rally on the next trading day,
then the markets are in deep
trouble and are setting up for
a major slide. This happened
during the first week of July



==================================================
                    PAGE 1329                     
==================================================

2004 (see Figure 6.7).
On this daily chart of the
trin and the mini-sized Dow,
the trin closed on July 1,
2004, with a reading of 2.80
(point 1). The next day, the
markets tried to rally early in
the session, but ultimately
collapsed and ended lower on
the day. This is always an
ominous sign, and the Dow
went on to lose 673 points
before bottoming out on

                    PAGE 1330                     
==================================================

August 6, 2004. On July 6,
2004, the trin closed at 2.12
(point 3) and the Dow
managed to rally the next day
(point 4), but the bulls’
moment of glory was short-
lived. This same scenario
unfolded during the second
trading day of 2005, January
4, when the trin closed at
2.53. The next day, the
markets couldn’t rally, and
they ended up selling off 410
points through the rest of the

month.
Is There a Similar Tool Just
for Nasdaq Stocks?
The trinq (TradeStation
symbol $TRINQ) is just like
the trin, except that it’s for
the Nasdaq. The same rules
apply here—all I’m
interested in is the trend of
the trinq.
Figure 6.8 is the same
chart we were looking at on



==================================================
                    PAGE 1332                     
==================================================

March 29, 2005, but I’ve
added the trinq and the
Nasdaq. With the trinq going
higher, the Nasdaq is going
lower. In general, I place
more weight on the trin, but I
like to see what is happening
in the Nasdaq as well. There
are times when the trinq will
be the leading mover,
making new highs or new
lows before the trin. On days
where the trinq is mixed and
the trin is trending, I will pay



==================================================
                    PAGE 1333                     
==================================================

more attention to the trin.
The strongest moves in the
market occur when both the
trin and the trinq are moving
more or less in alignment.

Figure 6.8
Put/Call Ratio—Is This the
Key to the Kingdom?
As a trader, what would you
give to be able to know what
the rest of the market
participants are doing at any
given time? If a broker told
me that he could provide me
with that information each
and every day, I’d be so
appreciative that I might



==================================================
                    PAGE 1338                     
==================================================

even let him charge me $25 a
round turn for an E-mini
futures contract. While a
secret report is not going to
magically appear in your in-
box, the put/call ratio
(TradeStation symbol
$PCVA and referred to
during the rest of this section
as PC) is as close to actually
having this information as a
trader is going to get.
The PC ratio measures



==================================================
                    PAGE 1339                     
==================================================

how many put options are
bought relative to call
options. The formula is very
simple to calculate—take the
volume for puts and divide
by the volume for calls. (For
anyone who is not familiar
with options, buying a put is
making a bet that the market
is going to fall, and buying a
call is making a bet that the
market is going to rise.) If
there are 50,000 puts sold
and 100,000 calls, the ratio is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1340                     
==================================================

50,000/100,000, or 0.5. If
there are 125,000 puts sold
and 85,000 calls, the ratio is
1.47.
There are three main PC
ratios that are generated
throughout the day: the
equity PC ratio, the index PC
ratio, and the combined
equity/index PC ratio. The
equity PC ratio is generally
very low, which reflects a
retail crowd that has a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1341                     
==================================================

tendency to favor the long
side (more call buying). The
index PC ratio is usually very
high (more put buying),
which reflects an institutional
mindset that wants to stay
hedged against any
unexpected move lower. The
combined equity/index PC
ratio reflects the behavior of
both of these groups and
gives a trader the best gauge
of what the overall market
participants are thinking,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1342                     
==================================================

and, more important, where
they are placing their bets. It
is this combined equity/index
PC ratio that I watch during
the trading day.
To illustrate how I use this
indicator, let’s assume that
the market is made up of
exactly 100 participants.
Let’s further assume that all
100 of these people are
bearish on the markets, and
that because of this prevalent



==================================================
                    PAGE 1343                     
==================================================

feeling, they have established
short positions in stocks,
ETFs, and index futures, as
well as through the buying of
puts. With all 100 market
participants bearish and now
short, a very interesting turn
of events takes place—there
is nobody left to sell. With
nobody left to sell, the
markets don’t have any
downward pressure, and they
start to drift higher. This
drifting eventually hits the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1344                     
==================================================

first set of stop orders placed
in the market by the 100
market participants who are
short. Within any given
group of traders, some will
be using tight stops, some
medium stops, and some
wide stops. The group of
tight stops gets hit first, and
this generates fresh buying
pressure in the form of short
covering that drives the
markets higher, right into the
next range of stops. This next



==================================================
                    PAGE 1345                     
==================================================

series of stops kicks off yet
another short-covering spree,
which, once triggered, drives
the markets even higher into
the next range of stops, and
so on until all the stops are
taken out.
At this point, the 100
market participants get
bullish, and they start buying
stocks and index futures, as
well as call options. Once
they have all scrambled to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1346                     
==================================================

establish their positions, a
very curious thing takes
place—there is nobody left to
buy. With nobody left to buy,
the markets begin to drift
lower and take out the first
set of tight stops, which in
turn creates enough selling
pressure to drive the markets
down to the next set of stops,
and so forth. It’s a vicious
cycle.
Obviously this is a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1347                     
==================================================

simplified scenario, and in
the real world, not every
single market participant is
going to be bullish or bearish
at exactly the same time.
However, the amount and
intensity of bullish and
bearish bias does fluctuate
regularly, and this shift in
attitude causes markets to
move in a fashion related to
the oversimplified scenario
just described. This brings
me to my first rule regarding



==================================================
                    PAGE 1348                     
==================================================

the PC ratio:
If the combined
equity/index PC
ratio gets over 1.0
intraday, I will
ignore all short
setups and start
looking at long
setups.
A PC ratio of over 1.0
represents extreme



==================================================
                    PAGE 1349                     
==================================================

bearishness and put buying,
and, as a result of the
scenario just described,
places a floor in the markets.
It’s not an immediate floor.
When the ratio goes to 1.0,
the markets don’t suddenly
stop declining and then
immediately rally. It’s a
process, and a visible support
level does take shape because
of the simple fact that there
are too many bears in the
market—and lots of buy



==================================================
                    PAGE 1350                     
==================================================

stops sitting overhead, just
waiting to be taken out.
These 1.0 readings usually
happen when the markets
have fallen for a number of
days in a row, or when bad
earnings or economic data hit
the tape, suddenly infecting
many market participants
with a bearish outlook. In
fact, many times a market
will continue falling until the
PC ratio gets over 1.0. The
opposite extreme is also true,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1351                     
==================================================

which brings me to my next
rule:
If the combined PC
ratio falls under 0.60
intraday, I will
ignore all long
setups and start
looking at short
setups.
A PC ratio of under 0.60
represents extreme call



==================================================
                    PAGE 1352                     
==================================================

buying and puts a ceiling on
the markets. This represents
a scenario in which there are
too many bulls and very few
people left to buy. Now there
are lots of sell stops sitting
beneath the current levels,
just waiting to be hit. This
usually happens after the
markets have rallied for a
number of days in a row, or
after seemingly great
earnings or economic news
hits the tape. Also, people



==================================================
                    PAGE 1353                     
==================================================

who have missed the move
start chasing it in the fear of
being left behind. In fact,
many times a market will
continue rallying until the PC
ratio gets under 0.60.
Figure 6.9 is a 15-minute
chart that shows the mini-
sized Dow overlaid on top of
the equity/index PC ratio. On
February 22, 2005, the PC
ratio stayed low most of the
day, dipping below 0.60.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1354                     
==================================================

This represents a bullish
outlook and the buying of
stocks, index futures, and
calls. This placed a lot of
stops below the markets, and
the Dow subsequently sold
off over 120 points to clear
them out. On February 23,
the PC ratio spent a little
time over 1.0, which
represents a bearish outlook,
the establishment of short
positions, and the buying of
puts—and the placing of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1355                     
==================================================

many stops above the
market. This was enough to
kick-start a modest rally into
the close, as the overhead
stops provided the fuel for
the market rally. On
February 24, the PC worked
itself to an extreme high
reading, while the markets
gapped down and stayed
under pressure early in the
session. However, with so
many people bearish and
with so many buy stops



==================================================
                    PAGE 1356                     
==================================================

sitting above the markets, the
market had little choice but
to rally. On February 25, the
PC started the day low but
quickly rallied and stayed
near 0.80 for most of the day.
On February 28, the PC
started off low and spent
nearly an hour under 0.60.
This means that everyone
was excited and was buying
calls because of the rally on
February 25, and now, with
so many sell stops in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1357                     
==================================================

market resulting from all the
fresh long positions, the
markets drifted lower and
took them out.



==================================================

==================================================

Figure 6.9
To reiterate, the main
thing I’m looking for in the
PC ratio is whether or not it
is at an extreme range. This
indicator doesn’t spend a lot
of time in the extreme
ranges, but they are hit often
enough to have an impact on
the markets. What about
when the PC is not
generating an extreme



==================================================
                    PAGE 1360                     
==================================================

reading?
The PC actually spends a
lot of time in what I call
“neutral” territory. This is
between 0.70 and 0.90.
During these periods, the PC
is generally not a factor in
my trading decisions.
However, there is another
aspect of the PC that I will
watch during the day, and
that is the “trend” of the PC.
And this brings me to my



==================================================
                    PAGE 1361                     
==================================================

next rule:
If the market is
rallying, I want to
see the PC rallying
to confirm the move.
If the market is
falling, I want to see
the PC falling to
confirm the move.
If the PC is rallying, this
means that more people are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1362                     
==================================================

getting bearish, and they are
shorting stock, shorting
indexes, and buying puts.
This means that people don’t
believe in the rally, and they
are using the strength to
establish short positions.
Little do they know that their
act of shorting merely adds
fuel to the next leg higher, as
the market now has a series
of stop orders sitting
overhead, just waiting to be
ripped through. If, however,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1363                     
==================================================

the market is rallying and the
PC is falling, this is because
people believe in the rally
and are chasing it—a sign
that it has run its course.
Naturally, the opposite is
also true. If the market is
falling and the PC is falling,
this means that more people
are bullish, and they are
using the market weakness to
buy stocks and buy calls.
They are merely providing
fuel for the market to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1364                     
==================================================

continue on its downward
path in the form of new sell
orders placed below the
market. If the market is
falling and the PC is rallying,
this means that people are
getting scared and are
chasing the market lower—a
sign that the decline is about
to end (see Figure 6.10).
1. On March 29, 2005,
the mini-sized Dow
futures gap down



==================================================
                    PAGE 1365                     
==================================================

and try to push
lower.
2. The PC rallies as
people scramble to
establish short
positions and buy
puts.
3. This increases put
buying. Even
though it doesn’t
push the PC above
1.0, it is enough to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1366                     
==================================================

get the markets to
reverse course and
take out the
overhead stop
orders.
4. Traders view this
rally in the YM as a
positive thing, and
they start buying
calls as the market
pulls back. This call
buying intensifies,
driving the PC ratio



==================================================
                    PAGE 1367                     
==================================================

to under 0.65.
5. With the aggressive
call buying, the YM
drifts lower for a
few hours and then
cracks, falling more
than 120 points.
6. With the decline,
traders start to
worry that they are
going to miss the
down move, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1368                     
==================================================

they start shorting
stock and buying
puts. This drives the
PC ratio to its highs
on the day.
7. Although the
markets don’t rally
into the close, they
stabilize, as a high
PC ratio starts to
establish a floor in
the markets.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1369                     
==================================================

Figure 6.11 shows the
markets the next day. With
the markets closing near their
lows on March 29, people get
bearish the next morning,
and on the gap up, they start
shorting aggressively and
buying puts for the
“inevitable” move lower. The
PC ratio gets very high as the
traders race to get positioned
on the short side. How does
the market respond? By
closing more than 140 points



==================================================
                    PAGE 1370                     
==================================================

higher than the previous
day’s close.
I do want to point out that
I largely discount the PC
ratio until after 10:00 a.m.
EST. There are a lot of listed
stocks that take time to get
opened, and a lot of
overnight option orders that
take time to get executed.
This causes a lot of erratic
movement in the PC ratio.
Also, I ignore the reading on



==================================================
                    PAGE 1371                     
==================================================

options expiration day, as it
tends to get out of whack
because of all the specific
options-related activity.
The PC ratio is a valuable
intraday trading tool. As of
this writing, there are many
data feeds that do not carry
this indicator. On
TradeStation, you have to be
permissioned for “opra” in
order to receive the PC ratio.
For example, while it is

is currently not available on
eSignal. More quote vendors
will supply this information
if their customers ask for it.

Figure 6.11
What Is the Most Effective
Way to See What’s Really
Going On in the Stock
Market During the Day?
The sector sorter list (SSL) is
a simple tool that I use to
gauge what is going on
“beneath the indexes.” I list
all the key sectors and have
them sorted automatically
every few seconds



==================================================
                    PAGE 1377                     
==================================================

throughout the trading day
based on their net percent
change. This tells me at a
glance which sectors are
leading the markets higher or
lower, and this brings me to
my first rule regarding the
sector sorter list:
Any move without
the banks (BKX),
brokers (XBD), and
semiconductors



==================================================
                    PAGE 1378                     
==================================================

(SOX) is suspect and
most likely will not
last.
On April 1, 2005, the only
sectors up on the day, for the
most part, were energy,
housing, and gold. (See
Figure 6.12.) One of the
worst sectors of the day was
the semiconductors, and not
far behind it were brokers
and banks. I like knowing
where these sectors are in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1379                     
==================================================

mix for three reasons: First,
the giant money-center banks
represent the biggest (or
almost biggest, depending on
current prices) market
capitalization sector in the
market. The markets need
participation from this index
if they hope to make any
headway. Second, brokers
are a great market proxy. As
go the brokers, so go the
markets. Third, everyone
participates in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1380                     
==================================================

semiconductor stocks. They
have a strong following
among retail and institutional
investors alike. If I see a
decline with these three
sectors leading the way
lower, I am confident that the
decline is going to last. The
reverse is also true.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1381

==================================================

Figure 6.12
The other way I like to
use this list is when the
markets are quiet and
choppy. Often there are
stealth moves in the markets.
This happens when the
overall indexes are restricted
in a tight range, but
underneath the surface, a
couple of key sectors are
deteriorating or firming. This
often is not picked up in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1383                     
==================================================

index itself. This brings me
to my next rule:
During these quiet
periods in the
market, the more
sectors that go red,
the greater the odds
are that, when the
market finally does
break, it will be to
the downside.
Conversely, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1384                     
==================================================

more sectors that go
green, the greater the
odds are that, when
the market finally
does break, it will be
to the upside.
Like a doctor’s
relationship to a patient’s
medical chart, the sector
sorter list helps a trader
gauge the overall health of
the current market
environment. ETFs can also



==================================================
                    PAGE 1385                     
==================================================

be utilized for this. The nine
I like to follow are XLY
(Consumer Discretionary),
XLF (Financial), XLB
(Materials), XLP (Consumer
Staples), XLV (Health Care),
XLK (Technology), XLE
(Energy), XKI (Industrial),
and XLU (Utilities).
How Do You Know When
It’s Going to Be a Choppy
Day?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1386                     
==================================================

One of the most frustrating
things for traders is dealing
with a tight-range, choppy
day in the stock indexes.
Choppy days occur when the
stock indexes spend most of
the day trading in a slow,
narrow range, providing
minimal volatility. Most
traders don’t realize that the
trading is choppy until about
halfway through the day.
They can tell by looking at
the chart, and they can tell by



==================================================
                    PAGE 1387                     
==================================================

the amount of losing trades
that they have taken. In
addition, there are specific
trade setups that work great
in choppy markets. If a trader
relentlessly pursues a setup
that works best in trending
markets, she is going to get
killed. Two of my favorite
choppy market strategies are
described in Chapters 8 and 9
(pivots and tick fades).
My goal is to identify



==================================================
                    PAGE 1388                     
==================================================

what type of market it is
going to be as early as
possible in the trading day.
To do this, I set up a five-
minute chart of the E-mini
S&P 500 futures, and the
only indicator I place on this
chart is volume. Once this is
done, I place a horizontal line
at the 25,000 level on the
volume chart (or as close to
25,000 as I can place it).
In Figure 6.13, we can see



==================================================
                    PAGE 1389                     
==================================================

that the trading during the
first hour on September 27,
2011, had the vast majority
of the volume bars going
over 25,000. This is typical,
as the first hour of trading is
typically hectic. This means
that more than 25,000
contracts were traded every
five minutes. The markets
traded quietly higher for
most of the day, and then
started to ease back into the
final hour. Once volume



==================================================
                    PAGE 1390                     
==================================================

spiked above 25,000
contracts and then stayed
above that level, it indicated
that bears were swooping in
for the kill. And kill they did,
sending the S&Ps 30 points
lower into the close. Volume
is extremely helpful in
measuring the conviction of
the move. Had the market
started to sell off on light
volume, I would have known
that there wasn’t much
conviction in the move. It



==================================================
                    PAGE 1391                     
==================================================

was just a probe that would
most likely fail, and it would
indicate a buying opportunity
for a continuation rally into
the close. However, once the
volume backs the move, it’s
continuation at its best, and
there is no reason to fight it,
just go with it. In Figure
6.14, we can see the $TICK
from that same day. For
much of the day, the $TICK
spent quality time above
zero, frequently hitting the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1392                     
==================================================

+1,000 level. During this
time, any pullbacks to the
zero lines were buying
opportunities, with moves
back up to +1,000 an
opportunity to sell that
position. However, once
volume spiked higher and the
$TICK hit its first –1,000
reading into the close, the
nature of the market
changed. As you can see, all
rallies back to the zero line
were rejected (offering



==================================================
                    PAGE 1393                     
==================================================

shorting opportunities) as the
bears kept pounding the bulls
into submission. In fact, the
$TICK got as low as –1,200,
which indicates extreme
selling taking shape.
Watching both the volume
and the $TICK together
offers a great map of what’s
going on underneath the
surface on any given day.
This brings me to my rule for
watching this volume chart:

This is a simple way to
determine early on if the
markets are going to be
choppy or more volatile on
the day. This allows traders
to choose the setups that are
more appropriate for these
types of markets early in the
day. To put it simply, on
choppy days, it’s best to fade
extreme $TICK readings. On
trending days, it’s better to
go with extreme $TICK
readings by fading moves

Listening In on the Floor—
What Is the True Value of
Pit Noise?
There are feeds available
from people who are
standing just outside of the
S&P futures pit at the

Exchange. They will stand
there and call out the current
bid/ask prices and make
comments on the market
action. I like to have this
playing quietly in the
background on those crazy
days when the stock market
is moving hard. One of my
trading partners, Hubert
Senters, likes to play it loud
every day, as he pays
attention to all the nuances
coming out of the pit. Hubert

                    PAGE 1402

introduced me to pit noise,
and the first few months I
listened to it, the noise nearly
drove me to drink, so I
turned it off. After three
days, I realized that I missed
it just enough. These days I
like to day-trade the stock
index futures on the “crazy
days” with the pit noise
playing in the background. If
it’s a quiet or “normal” day,
then I’m fine without it. Here
is how it works and how I



==================================================
                    PAGE 1403                     
==================================================

use it.
First off, it’s important to
understand what the people
in the pits are talking about.
All day long, a trader is
going to hear the bid/ask
being quoted, and it typically
goes like this: “six twenty by
a half, six twenty by a half,”
and so on. This is a quote for
the big S&P contract, which
is quoted in tenths instead of
quarters like the E-minis.



==================================================

This means that the current
bid/ask is 1,136.20 by
1,136.50. The quotes just
focus on the last few
numbers instead of the entire
price.
The person doing the
talking will frequently refer
to “paper versus local.”
Paper coming into the market
means that it is a retail order
and was placed by a broker
such as Goldman Sachs or

Merrill Lynch. “Local
market” means that the locals
are trading among
themselves; this happens
when the action is slow and
the volume is light. I have
listened to many pit
broadcasters, and by far the
best one is Ben Lichtenstein
with www.tradersaudio.com.
He absolutely loves what he
does, and this comes across
each day in his broadcasts.
Every summer, we hold a

                    PAGE 1406                     
==================================================

four-day seminar in Chicago.
We have Ben come in for an
hour and talk about how he
reads the tape and what
listeners should key in on.
Then, the next day, we take
the group down to the CME
floor so that they can watch
Ben in action calling out the
pit noise live. They see
exactly what he is looking at,
what he is calling out, and
why he is doing it. It’s a
great experience. We did

manage to get one of these
sessions filmed, and it is fun
to watch on DVD.
Here’s some terminology.
A “thin top” means that there
are not a lot of bids at these
levels—look for the market
rally to fail. If Ben mentions
a scale buyer or a scale
seller, I pay attention to what
that seller is doing and at
what levels.
When Ben mentions a

                    PAGE 1408                     
==================================================

“top tenner,” this means that
one of the 10 biggest guys in
the pit is doing something.
Once in a while, you will
hear that a “top tenner” is
stuck short, and this provides
great opportunities to jump in
on a trade as the top tenner is
forced to cover hundreds of
the big S&P contracts to get
out of his position. This is
information that you can’t
learn from watching a chart.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1409                     
==================================================

I also like to listen to the
overall noise level. Is it quiet
and slow, or is it loud and
fast? If the noise explodes, it
is almost like the ticks
reaching the +1,000 level.
This level of activity is
unsustainable, and the
markets will reverse. If the
sound is quiet and then it
gradually gets louder, I will
go in the direction of the
market until the noise
“explodes,” and then I’ll get



==================================================
                    PAGE 1410                     
==================================================

out.
My favorite way to use
the noise from the pit is to
listen and figure out whether
the noise is louder on the up
moves or the down moves. If
a market is rallying and the
pit noise is loud, and then the
market pulls back and the pit
noise is quiet, this is a
crystal-clear signal that the
momentum is higher, and I
will aggressively buy all



==================================================
                    PAGE 1411                     
==================================================

pullbacks on these days. The
reverse is also true. Once I
got used to this, I found it
very hard to look at a chart
without having this “pit noise
indicator” in the background.
There are many other
ways to use pit noise. If
someone is above or below
the market with size and the
locals fill it, go in the
direction of that move. This
means the locals are pushing



==================================================
                    PAGE 1412                     
==================================================

the markets instead of fading
the markets.
If the pit moderator tells
you what the low is, and that
low is below the lows of the
day you see on your charts,
the market is going lower
and is about to make new
lows on the day. If the pit
moderator says look for a
stop run at 1,136, pay
attention to that number if
you are below it.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1413                     
==================================================

The most important thing
with pit noise is not to get
caught up in the excitement.
It is easy to think that this is
the Holy Grail when you first
get it. But it’s not. It’s just
another tool. Traders who get
caught up in the excitement
of the pit buy the highs and
sell the lows, just like any
other amateur.

Trading Day from the
Opening Bell?
It is easy to get overwhelmed
by too much data, and the
key for reading all of these
data is to do it in such a way
that your brain can take in
the information as quickly
and as efficiently as possible.
I do this by looking at these
data in a certain order, in two
columns, top to bottom, left
to right.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1415                     
==================================================

Figure 6.15 shows how I
tie all this information into a
single screen. The trin and
the trinq are in the upper left,
and these are what I look at
first. Then my eyes go below
this to the PC ratio, which is
what I look at second (note
that the symbol for this is
now $PCVA instead of
$WPCVA). After this, I look
at the ticks, which are at the
bottom left of the screen.
From here my eyes jump to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1416                     
==================================================

the upper right and to the
sector sorter list. Finally, I
look at the tiki. I don’t even
have to look at a chart to
know that the market has
been selling off steadily all
day.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1417                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 1418                     
==================================================

Figure 6.15
Figure 6.16 shows these
key indicators against the
backdrop of a strong market.
At a glance, I can see that the
trin and trinq are trending
lower, and that the PC ratio
started off well at over 1.0 on
the day. I can see that the
ticks are spending a lot of
quality time above zero, and
that most of the sectors are in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1419                     
==================================================

positive territory. I can also
see, with the tiki, that there
have been a lot more buy
programs than sell programs.
On this type of day, I want to
focus on long setups and
ignore short setups.
In addition to being able
to get a solid feeling for
whether the market has
upside or downside pressure,
this will also help a trader
understand when the markets



==================================================
                    PAGE 1420                     
==================================================

are in “chop mode.” This will
happen when these different
indicators conflict with one
another. For example, the trin
is making new highs
(bearish), but the ticks are
spending all their time above
zero (bullish). One of my
favorite ways to see whether
or not we have a choppy
market is also the simplest. I
look at the sector sorter list,
and if about half the sectors
are green and half the sectors

                    PAGE 1421

more neutral than that.
I don’t include the ES

there is not enough room. I

What Are the Other Main
Things to Keep Track Of?
Not a whole lot has changed
since I wrote this chapter
back in 2005. In fact, my
updates to this chapter have
been minimal, with the
exception of the volume
numbers on the ES from

                    PAGE 1423                     
==================================================

Figure 6.13, which have
grown to 25,000 from
10,000. I’ve also been using
the $TICK a little differently,
utilizing the 0.00 line as an
entry opportunity on those
strong days, of which we’ve
had so many in August and
September of 2011. The
$TRIN is still good, although
its impact has been muted a
bit with all of the reverse
ETFs that are on the market
now, which are trading good

                    PAGE 1424                     
==================================================

volume and skewing the
$TRIN numbers—not a lot,
but they are skewed a touch.
To make up for this, there are
two “new” internals that I
also watch these days. I say
“new” only because they
aren’t really new—I just
watch them a lot more
intently now than I did a few
years ago. These indicators
are the $VOLSPD (S&P 500
Up-Down Volume
Difference) and the $VIX,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1425                     
==================================================

which is of course the CBOE
Volatility Index.

                    PAGE 1427                     
==================================================

Figure 6.16
The $VOLSPD is
worthless at the beginning of
the day, but it’s priceless into
the last hour of trading.
When I look at this indicator,
I think of selling pressure
and buying pressure. If
selling pressure is sustained
into the final hour, then look
for a sell-off into the close. If
buying pressure is sustained,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1428                     
==================================================

then look for a rally. This
may seem overly simplistic,
but there are a lot of fake-
outs during the last half-hour
of trading. If the stock
market sells off seemingly
hard, but the $VOLSPD
continues to grind higher,
guess what? The stock
market is going to reverse
and rally into the close. The
opposite is also true.
In Figure 6.17, we see a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1429                     
==================================================

chart of both the $VOLSPD
and the SPY on a five-minute
chart. Around 1:45 p.m.
central at point 1, the stock
market begins to rally, and
the rally is persistent for
nearly half an hour. Is this
real buying, or is it a fake-
out? By looking at the
$VOLSPD, we can tell not
only that it is a fake-out, but
that the market has a high
probability of selling off into
the close. Not only does the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1430                     
==================================================

$VOLSPD not confirm the
rally, but it actually starts to
make new lows on the day,
which in this case is the
death knell for bulls. The
markets crater into the close.

Figure 6.17
The $VIX has, of course,
been around forever, and it’s
importance increases as
market volatility increases.
This is also known as the
“fear indicator,” as it does a
good job of measuring panic.
Panic, of course, can get
overdone, and too much
panic is a buy signal.
In Figure 6.18, we see a

daily chart of the $VIX on
the upper half with a set of
standard Bollinger Bands
with the settings at 20 and 2.
The bottom half of the chart
is the SPY. Note that anytime
the $VIX rallies up to the top
of the Bollinger Bands, and
especially when it closes
above the Bollinger Bands,
not only is a market bottom
in the making, but a
potentially violent rally as
well.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1434                     
==================================================

At point 3, see what
happened on the day of the
infamous “flash crash,”
where the market went nuts
to the downside for part of
the day. The $VIX spiked
higher. People were freaking
out. And what happened?
The market had a violent
multiday rally that exceeded
the highs just prior to the
flash crash. Going along the
chart, you can clearly see that
any extremes in the $VIX



==================================================
                    PAGE 1435                     
==================================================

reading, indicating extreme
fear in the markets, indicated
that the selling had exhausted
itself. The lesson? Don’t get
too excited on the downside
if the $VIX is extended.

I’ll also watch the $VIX
on a five-minute chart
intraday, as seen in Figure
6.19. With this, I’m just
looking for the $VIX to
make any breakout or
breakdown moves. The $VIX
is fast and will typically
break before the market. At
point 1, the $VIX popped
higher, and shortly thereafter
the markets broke down. As

                    PAGE 1438

long as the $VIX is trending
higher in this case, the
market will continue to sell
off.

For the $VIX, I utilize the

relief rally.

This One Thing, You Don’t
Stand a Chance?
There has been a lot in the
press over the past few years
about the “carry trade,” but
most traders and investors
don’t give it much thought.
“That’s some weird thing the
hedge funds are doing,” they
think. “It doesn’t apply to
me.” And that is where the
traders are wrong. Dead
wrong.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1442                     
==================================================

The carry trade affects the
markets today more than
nearly anything else.
Stripping it down to its
simplest measure, it works
like this: hedge funds borrow
a low-interest currency like
the yen or U.S. dollars, and
then put those funds into
higher-yielding currencies
like the Australian dollar.
Then they borrow against
these Australian dollars and
go out and buy appreciating



==================================================
                    PAGE 1443                     
==================================================

assets such as stocks, gold,
silver, grains, oil … you
name it. Why do they go to
all of this trouble? Simple: to
make big returns so that they
can collect big fees.
Why is this important?
Because when funds are
putting on the carry trade,
also known as “putting risk
on,” then most asset classes
rise in value—the funds are
buying them hand over fist.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1444                     
==================================================

More important, however, is
when funds are “taking risk
off.” When they do this, it
means that they are winding
down portions of their carry
trade. To do this, they have
to (1) sell off the assets they
bought, (2) dump the high-
yielding currency they own,
and (3) pay back the cheap
currency they borrowed.
These three steps all happen
very close to simultaneously.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1445                     
==================================================

Why is this important to
know? Because when hedge
funds are taking risk off,
nearly all asset classes will
sell off, regardless of what’s
going on in the news.
That’s great, but how does
a trader know when hedge
funds are putting risk on or
when they are taking risk
off? By watching CNBC?
No. They aren’t really sure
what happened until way



==================================================
                    PAGE 1446                     
==================================================

after the fact. If hedge funds
could hide their footsteps and
their actions, believe me,
they would. Surprisingly, this
information on whether
hedge funds are putting risk
on or taking it off is very
easy to obtain. All you need
is a data feed.
Figure 6.20 is a chart of
the AUDJPY cross, where
the current price is 73.739.
This just means that 1



==================================================
                    PAGE 1447                     
==================================================

Australian dollar is equal to
73.74 Japanese yen. Believe
it or not, this chart represents
what hedge funds are doing
in real time. The price of
AUDJPY isn’t critical. What
is critical is whether the chart
is moving higher or lower.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1448                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 1449                     
==================================================

Figure 6.20
It’s not that AUDJPY
represents all carry trade
activity. However, it does
represent one very common
carry trade, which is to
borrow Japanese yen and
then put that money into
Australian dollars. The more
yen that are being borrowed,
the more the Australian
dollar is being bought, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1450                     
==================================================

thus the higher AUDJPY
goes (that is, as risk is being
put on, 1 Australian dollar
can buy more and more yen).
Thus, when the carry trade is
“on,” AUDJPY will rise.
And when the carry trade is
being taken off, AUDJPY
will fall as Australian dollars
are sold to pay back the yen
loans. If that seems a little
complicated, this is all you
have to remember:



==================================================
                    PAGE 1451                     
==================================================

Figure 6.20 shows a chart
of AUDJPY with the stock
market (SPY) plotted below
it. The dates represented are
from October 2010 through
October 5, 2011. Points 1
and 2 show both a rising
AUDJPY and a rising stock
market. Points 3 and 4 show
both a falling AUDJPY and a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1452                     
==================================================

falling stock market. That’s
easy enough. Where this gets
interesting is when AUDJPY
acts as a leading indicator,
which it did at point 5. On
this date, March 29, 2011,
AUDJPY broke out and
made new highs. What did
the stock market do?
Nothing. It was in turmoil
over yet another European
country being on the brink of
insolvency. And yet
AUDJPY kept moving



==================================================
                    PAGE 1453                     
==================================================

higher and higher, indicating
that funds were aggressively
putting risk on. Lo and
behold, about a month later,
on April 26, 2011, the stock
market broke out and made
new highs. A trader who was
listening to every word of the
financial press got short
stocks because of the
continuing coverage and
worry over the European
debt crisis. Traders who
understood the importance of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1454                     
==================================================

the carry trade bought stocks,
or call options on stocks, to
await the inevitable catching
up of the stock market to the
actual risk being put on by
hedge funds. Long story
short, the money that the
funds are borrowing has to
be put to work.
In Figure 6.21, we have an
intraday five-minute chart of
AUDJPY and the E-mini
S&Ps. I like watching this



==================================================
                    PAGE 1455                     
==================================================

during the day and gauging
the intensity of a sell-off in
the ES. Point 1 shows a big
sell-off in the ES midday on
October 5, 2011. If, during
this sell-off, AUDJPY has a
mere “mild pullback” (as it
does at point 2), then the
chances of the ES turning
around and rallying are very
strong (as it does here). If the
ES sells off and the AUDJPY
also takes a nosedive, then
you know that the selling in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1456                     
==================================================

the stock market is for real.
Finally, the last reason it
is important to understand
the carry trade is because it
explains what many people
find unexplainable. For
example, during the 2008
financial crisis, everyone and
his mother was talking about
how the U.S. dollar was
dead, and how it was critical
to put all available funds into
gold and gold stocks. What



==================================================
                    PAGE 1457                     
==================================================

happened during the heat of
the financial crisis in October
2008? Gold got annihilated,
selling off from $1,080 an
ounce down to $707 an
ounce. Gold stocks fared far
worse. Goldcorp Inc. (GG), a
very solid and popular gold
stock, fell from $52.65 to
$13.84. This was a typical
move for gold stocks during
the heat of the financial crisis
from July to October 2008.
Everyone who thought she

thing” got taken out back and

Figure 6.22 shows exactly
what happened. The top chart
is AUDJPY, and we can see
that risk was coming off in a
big way, as AUDJPY
plummeted from just over
100.00 to below 60.00.
Remember when I said that
markets move because they
have to, not because they



==================================================
                    PAGE 1459                     
==================================================

want to? Bingo. This was
essentially the largest margin
call in the world. Funds were
forced to sell everything that
counted as an asset, and that
included gold. It didn’t
matter what the asset was or
whether or not it had intrinsic
value. All of the assets that
they had bought with
borrowed money had to be
sold so that they could pay
back their loans. And this is
also why the U.S. dollar



==================================================
                    PAGE 1460                     
==================================================

rallied during this time. The
U.S. dollar is also used in the
carry trade, along with the
yen, because it is such a low-
interest currency (at least it
has been over the past few
years). As the carry trade was
“taken off” and yen and U.S.
dollars got “paid back,”
guess what happened? The
U.S. dollar rallied. Why?
Borrowing money is the
equivalent of selling it;
paying it back is the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1461                     
==================================================

equivalent of buying it. That
is, paying back U.S. dollars
applies upward pressure on
the U.S. dollar chart. This is
why the U.S. dollar did not
collapse as many pundits
predicted. It may collapse
some day, but not while it is
a low-interest currency and
hedge funds are taking risk
off.

Where does the left-over
cash go once all the assets

bond futures rocket higher

on? Great, buy

Summing Up
It is important to realize that
the markets spend the
majority of the day, even the
majority of most weeks,
consolidating and resting and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1465                     
==================================================

backing and filling and pretty
much doing nothing. Traders
who wait for a move and
then have to chase it will
always be at a disadvantage
to traders who get in before
the move takes place. The
way to do this is to watch
these internals and look for
clues concerning the path of
least resistance. When the
markets are quiet, get
positioned for the next move
in this direction. Once the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1466                     
==================================================

move takes place, the
amateurs will chase it, and
you can sell your position to
them.

Finally, it is critical to
understand that all of the
stock index intraday setups
described in this book are
based on using all of these
intraday readings as a filter.
For example, Chapter 11
discusses squeeze plays. If I
get a two-minute squeeze
short play, but the trin is
trading at 0.53 and is near its



==================================================
                    PAGE 1469                     
==================================================

lows on the day, guess what?
I’m not going to take it
because the internals are so
bullish. Rather, I will sit back
and wait for the next long
setup. Because of this factor,
it is very difficult to back-test
these setups, as I would
never take all of them as they
come up—it’s all based on
what the internals are telling
me. I’ve set up
www.tradethemarkets.com/internals
with a series of free videos



==================================================
                    PAGE 1470

that show live trading and
how the internals work in
real time. These videos also
show updated internals I’m
using that aren’t included in
the book—sometimes it is
easier to “show how I use it
live” than to paste a chart in
a book. For anyone interested
in managed accounts
utilizing these techniques, we
have set up
www.razortrading.com with
more information on how the

The Opening Gap:
Why Is This the First
and Highest-
Probability
Play of the Day?
How Is Trading Without a
Specific Setup in Mind Like
Hiking in the Amazon



==================================================
                    PAGE 1477                     
==================================================

Without a Compass?
If I had a dollar for every
time someone asked me, “Of
all the setups you have,
what’s the one setup that
works best all of the time?”
I’d have my kids’ college
already paid for, as well as
their graduate school and
their weddings. And I’d
probably be able to take care
of my in-laws, too, and their
numbers are considerable.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1478                     
==================================================

There is no easy way around
it: different setups work
better in different market
conditions. Another question
I get asked a lot is, “What’s
the win ratio on that setup?”
I’ve never been asked that
question by an experienced
trader. It’s always a newbie.
Win/loss ratios have very
little to do with the setup and
everything to do with the
parameters that are being
applied to that setup. Are you



==================================================
                    PAGE 1479                     
==================================================

interested in a setup that has
a win ratio of 99 percent?
Great. Every time the $TICK
goes to –1,000, buy one ES
contract and use a 1-point
target and a 100-point stop.
This setup will win 99
percent of the time.
“Fantastic,” you might think.
But, alas, when it is stopped,
you’ll wipe out all of the
profit of the previous
incredible string of winning
trades. To put it in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1480                     
==================================================

perspective, I know many
traders who have a 50
percent win ratio and make a
lot of money trading. How?
Their winners are, on
average, three times bigger
than their losers. Yes, it all
comes back to trading
psychology and letting your
winners run and cutting your
losers off at the knees.
Before we jump into the
first of the setups, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1481                     
==================================================

opening gap play, I want to
quickly review one absolute
truth about this business.
That truth is as follows—
when it comes to trading for
a living, all investors fall into
one of three categories:
1. Those who have a
system that they
follow each and
every day
2. Those who are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1482                     
==================================================

developing a system
and are on the
lookout for the Holy
Grail
3. Those who have
never believed in
utilizing a specific
system and just
trade on instinct—
and are still
explaining to their
spouse how they
lost all their trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1483                     
==================================================

capital.
The point of this, of
course, is to emphasize the
importance of facing each
trading day with a game plan
and of establishing a trade
setup with a three-pronged
approach. In addition to the
actual setup, there also needs
to be a foundation from
which to operate the setup.
This foundation consists of
the following: the trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1484                     
==================================================

methodology, the money
management technique, and
the knowledge of the best
markets to trade for that
particular setup. In other
words, it’s a lot more than
just “What’s the entry?” Do
traders scale into a trade or
go all in? Do they scale out
or go all out? Is it better to
use a tight stop and bigger
size, or a wider stop and
smaller size? Does this trade
work better on the mini-sized



==================================================
                    PAGE 1485                     
==================================================

Dow or the euro currency?
Each market is unique. Each
setup is unique. Each time
frame is unique. Without
these additional data, traders
are destined to fail, and they
are only kidding themselves
if they think they can do this
for a living. They may have a
lot of fun for a few months or
a year, and they may get an
incredible high out of a great
trade, but it won’t last over
the long haul. These are the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1486                     
==================================================

traders that act quickly when
trying to make money and
that act too slowly when
trying to protect what they
have. The idea is to create a
situation that allows a person
to do this for a living—each
and every day.
This section focuses on a
series of setups for the active
trader and provides a
collection of strategies that I
currently use in my own



==================================================
                    PAGE 1487                     
==================================================

trading. Specific markets are
highlighted, with exact entry,
exit, and stop loss levels,
focusing mostly on intraday
setups. Swing-trading setups
are also discussed, and these
are noted as such. In general,
any setup that is used on the
stock index futures can also
be used on individual stocks.
Exceptions to this guideline
are noted. I like to use day-
trading strategies in one
account and swing-trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1488                     
==================================================

strategies in another account.
This keeps everything
separate and easy to track. I
chose to show setups that had
a successful resolution in
order to demonstrate how to
manage the exits on these
setups. In instances where
these setups get stopped out,
and that does of course
happen, sometimes
frequently, that is an easy
exit to manage—the stop was
hit. As a trader, it is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1489                     
==================================================

important that you realize
that not every trade will work
out. It is quite possible to get
stopped out two or three
times in a row before you
catch a successful move.
This is a normal part of
trading, and it is important
that a trader not get
frustrated. This is why it’s
important to “keep losses
small and let winners run.”
A typical scenario I’ve



==================================================
                    PAGE 1490                     
==================================================

witnessed with traders is that
they get stopped out of a
setup and then hesitate to
take the next one, which of
course turns out to be a
winner. Or they get stopped
out of a setup, so the next
time that setup occurs, they
take profits too fast. Or if the
last one was a winner (or a
loser), then they double up
on the next one. The point of
this is that a trader needs to
become like a machine and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1491                     
==================================================

just do the setups, not operate
based on “how he feels about
the last trade.” On any given
day, I will take five intraday
setups. One of these will get
stopped out, two will be
scratched, and two will be
winners. On days where my
first three trades are winners,
I will usually stop for the rest
of the day and book my
gains. If I hit a day where my
first three trades are stopped
out, I take the hint and go hit



==================================================
                    PAGE 1492                     
==================================================

golf balls.
I utilize a variety of
specific setups in my daily
trading routine. I started off
trading stocks and stock
options, so most of the setups
focus on some aspect of the
stock market, whether it’s
through individual stocks or
through the mini-stock index
futures. There are also setups
in other markets that I
discuss, particularly in gold,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1493                     
==================================================

silver, and some of the
currencies. Some of these I
developed myself, and some
of them were developed by
other people whom I trade
with. The purpose of this
section is to give you specific
setups that you can utilize on
the next trading day. It
should also give you a
blueprint for developing and
tweaking your own setups.
For me, the biggest
difference in my trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1494                     
==================================================

occurred when I learned to
ignore my brain and just
focus on a handful of good
setups. Once I learned the
setups, the next challenge
was to have the discipline to
follow them the same way,
each and every time. I did
this by recording my trading
activity for more than a year
and focusing on the results
for each setup. If I deviated
from the setup, if I tried to
outthink it and got out too



==================================================
                    PAGE 1495                     
==================================================

early or in too late, I noted
this in my data and marked it
as an “impulse play.” After a
while, I noticed that these
impulse plays didn’t make
me any money. I saw the
light, so to speak, and
suddenly my trading focus
took a dramatic shift. Instead
of focusing on the potential
gains of a trade or worrying
about missing a move, I
focused on executing a
flawless setup. That is the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1496                     
==================================================

key difference between a
trader who can do this for a
living and a trader who lives
a life of quiet frustration. I’m
not going to beat around the
bush on this: following
setups without letting the
day’s or week’s or month’s
P&L affect your thinking is
very, very hard to do. But it’s
the difference between life
and death.
It’s like quitting smoking.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1497                     
==================================================

Either people choose to light
up another cigarette or they
do not. They take it one day
at a time. For each day they
don’t light up, the better the
odds that they will never
smoke again. It is no
different in trading. For each
day traders can actually be
totally disciplined and follow
their setups exactly as
planned—even if it means
standing aside when the
market is racing away



==================================================
                    PAGE 1498                     
==================================================

without them—the better the
odds that they will make it in
this business. If you want
thrills, go to Disneyland.
Although I can’t stand
over your shoulder and help
you with your discipline, I
can show you the setups that
I use to trade for a living. I
have loosely organized these
in the order in which I look
at them throughout the
trading day. As you try these



==================================================
                    PAGE 1499                     
==================================================

out on your own, you will
find that you naturally
gravitate toward some rather
than others. Key in on this, as
a trader will tend to move
toward setups and markets
that seem to fit her
personality. Let’s jump right
in with the first setup and one
of my favorites—the opening
gap play.
Why Aren’t All Gaps
Created Equal?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1500                     
==================================================

With regard to gaps, very
little has changed since this
book first came out. I still
find gap plays to be the best
way to start off my trading
day. Not only are they the
first trades of the stock
market session, but, more
important, they can also tell a
person a lot about the
upcoming market action for
the day. Because of this, I
spend more time talking
about this setup than the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1501                     
==================================================

others.
Gaps are contrarian plays,
or “fade plays,” as I like to
call them. Opening gaps
create a lot of excitement and
emotion in the market
participants, and I like to step
in and take the opposite side
of this emotion. The play is
completely against the
crowd, which I like, and it is
one of the lowest-risk trades
available. What exactly is a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1502                     
==================================================

gap? A gap occurs when the
opening price of the next
day’s regular cash session is
greater or lower than the
closing price of the previous
day’s regular cash session,
creating a “gap” in price
levels on the charts, similar
to that space we see each
night between David
Letterman’s two front teeth.
It is important to note that
traders will not see this gap
on their charts unless they



==================================================
                    PAGE 1503                     
==================================================

specifically set up a “gap”
chart. With a 24-hour chart,
traders will not see the gaps.
This is discussed in more
detail shortly.
When it comes to gaps,
not all markets are created
equal. Gaps in “single-item”
markets do not act the same
way as gaps in “multi-item”
markets. Examples of single-
item markets include bonds,
currencies, grains, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1504                     
==================================================

individual stocks. These gaps
typically fill at some point,
but not necessarily on the
same day. For this play, I’m
specifically interested in gaps
that have a high probability
of filling on the same day
they are created. For single-
item markets, a news item
controls the entire order flow
for that day, instead of
affecting just a small portion
of an entire index.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1505                     
==================================================

This is especially true of
individual stocks. Individual
stocks are like politicians, in
that each day they can
produce a fresh skeleton
from the proverbial closet.
Earnings announcements,
corporate scandals, and
insider deals can create gaps
in price that never get filled.
Ken Lay and Bernie Ebbers
certainly wished that their
Enron and WorldCom stock
would fill their overhead



==================================================
                    PAGE 1506                     
==================================================

gaps. Unfortunately, the odds
of this happening are about
the same as that of
Republican and Democratic
senators working together for
the good of the country. In
other words, it’s never going
to happen. Because of the
unpredictable nature of
individual stocks, they make
poor candidates for gap fills.
The exception to this is gaps
on individual stocks that are
gapping with the market and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1507                     
==================================================

not on any particular news.
How does a person tell this?
If a stock is gapping about
the same percentage as the
overall market, and there
isn’t any news on that stock,
then that stock can be played
as a gap play. For example, if
AAPL gaps up 1.00 percent,
the overall S&P 500 is also
gapping up 1.00 percent, and
there isn’t any specific news
on AAPL, then it can be
played as a gap play. It’s just



==================================================
                    PAGE 1508                     
==================================================

moving with the overall
market.
As compared with single-
item markets, multi-item
markets such as the E-mini
S&Ps and the mini-sized
Dow futures, as well as their
equivalent ETFs (exchange-
traded funds) via the Spiders
(SPY) and Diamonds (DIA),
make great candidates for
gap plays. This is because
there are individual



==================================================
                    PAGE 1509                     
==================================================

components of these indexes
that will respond differently
to various news items. Good
news for oil companies is
bad news for transportation
companies. Good news for
defense stocks can be bad
news for travel-related
stocks, and so on. This
means that, although the
market may gap up on a
news item, there will be
individual stocks within the
index that will either ignore



==================================================
                    PAGE 1510                     
==================================================

the news or sell off on the
news. This, coupled with an
initial pullback in the strong
issues that are gapping up,
weighs down the entire
index, creating an
opportunity for the market to
fill its gap. In addition, many
fund managers watch the
open gaps. They’ve been
doing this for a long time,
and they know that the
markets hate to leave “messy
charts” in the form of open



==================================================
                    PAGE 1511                     
==================================================

gaps. If the markets gap up,
they will generally wait to
start committing to the long
side until the market has
pulled back and filled its gap.
In this way, it is also like a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
What about the Nasdaq
and the Russell? I’ve
watched these markets as
well, and although they do
fill their gaps a large
percentage of the time, that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1512                     
==================================================

percentage is lower than
those for the Dow and the
S&Ps. In the end, my
favorite gap plays are in the
mini-futures and ETFs
representing the Dow and the
S&P 500.
What Is So Magical About
Premarket Volume?
The great thing about gaps is
that they are like an open
window, and, like all



==================================================
                    PAGE 1513                     
==================================================

windows, at some point they
are going to be closed. The
key, then, is to be able to
accurately predict when the
day’s gap (window) is going
to be filled (closed). What is
as important as analyzing the
gap itself is analyzing the
market conditions that
produce the gap. The reason
for the gap is immaterial.
Upside earnings surprises,
terrorist threats, takeover
announcements, economic



==================================================
                    PAGE 1514                     
==================================================

reports—each morning the
markets are bombarded with
news. It’s not the actual
news, but how the markets
respond to that news that is
important. To understand
how the markets are really
reacting to the news, all a
person has to do is look at
the premarket volume. In
addition to news gaps, which
are more or less fishing
expeditions, there are also
professional gaps.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1515                     
==================================================

Professional gaps are
designed to keep the retail
investor out of the market.
These occur when the Dow
gaps up 100 points and then
trades in a tight range for the
rest of the day. The move
essentially happened before
the market opened. The
professionals who were
positioned for the move
benefit, while the average
retail investor is left with
nothing and no opportunity



==================================================
                    PAGE 1516                     
==================================================

to participate in the move.
Again, premarket volume can
tell a trader if the gap is
going to be a professional
breakaway event or is going
to lead to price action that
has a high probability of
filling the gap on the very
same day it was created. A
professional gap with high
premarket volume can take
weeks to get filled. Much
more common are gaps that
are news reactions or fishing



==================================================
                    PAGE 1517                     
==================================================

expeditions. These are
smaller in nature, are
highlighted with low to
moderate pre-market volume,
fill quickly, and can be faded
regularly.
The question, then, is, if I
ignore the reason for the gap,
what is it that I’m looking for
that determines whether or
not I will take the setup?
Premarket volume in what,
exactly? The key action I am



==================================================
                    PAGE 1518                     
==================================================

watching is the premarket
volume in a specific set of
cash stocks, typically the big
names of the day. When I
first wrote this in 2005, I
liked to watch KLAC (KLA-
Tencor Corp.), MXIM
(Maxim Integrated Products
Inc.), NVLS (Novellus
Systems Inc.), and AMAT
(Applied Materials Inc.). I
liked these stocks because
they were traded actively in
the premarket session and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1519                     
==================================================

were traded aggressively by
both individual traders and
fund managers. Today, I’ve
replaced these stocks with
AAPL (Apple), GOOG
(Google), PCLN (Priceline),
BIDU (Baidu), and AMZN
(Amazon). These are the
movers and shakers today.
Ten years from today, the set
of stocks may be different,
though it’s hard to imagine
AAPL and AMZN leaving
this list.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1520                     
==================================================

Even though these stocks
are not part of the Dow, they
still provide a clear map as to
how the market is handling
any particular news that is
out on the day. If the volume
on these stocks is heavy, then
it is obvious that the market
is taking this news very
seriously. If the volume on
these stocks is light, which is
more common, then the
market either is not interested
in the news or, more likely,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1521                     
==================================================

has already priced it in. It is
on these days that the gaps
have a very high probability
of filling on the same day in
which they were created.
What I’m looking for is
the premarket volume in
these stocks as of 9:20 a.m.
eastern, 10 minutes before
the regular cash session
opens. The premarket session
opens at 8:00 a.m. eastern, so
these are data on 1 hour and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1522                     
==================================================

20 minutes’ worth of trading.
If these stocks are trading
less than 30,000 shares each
at this time, the gap (up or
down) has an approximately
85 percent chance of filling
that same day. However, if
the volume jumps up to
50,000 shares each, the gap
has only about a 60 percent
chance of filling that same
day. On these particular days,
however, the midpoint of the
gap has an 85 percent chance



==================================================
                    PAGE 1523                     
==================================================

of being hit, so I do take this
into account and adjust my
target accordingly. For
example, if the gap is 50
points on the Dow and the
premarket volume is
moderate, then my target is
going to be 25 points from
my entry instead of the full
50 points, which would
constitute a gap fill. Finally,
if the premarket volume
jumps to more than 70,000
shares each, the chances of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1524                     
==================================================

the gap filling that same day
drop to 30 percent. These are
typically the days that
involve a professional
breakaway gap. On these
days, I don’t fade it. I
typically stand aside and wait
for one of my other setups to
unfold.
These figures are for
“normal” market conditions.
As I write this in September
2011, the markets have been



==================================================
                    PAGE 1525                     
==================================================

extremely volatile, and I’ve
had to double these numbers,
especially for AAPL. One
way to get an idea of these
levels is to look at the $VIX.
A few months ago, the $VIX
was trading at around 20.00,
which is essentially “normal”
and is what the volume
numbers given here are based
upon. It’s currently trading at
40.00, which indicates much
higher volatility—double, in
fact. Hence the volume levels



==================================================
                    PAGE 1526                     
==================================================

have also had to be doubled.
Take a look at where the
$VIX is trading and you’ll be
able to get the approximate
volume numbers you’ll need.
If it’s trading at 60.00, you’ll
need to triple the numbers
given here; if it’s trading at
10.00, you’ll need to cut
them in half; and so forth.
Why does this premarket
volume indicator work?
Think about it as driving a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1527                     
==================================================

car uphill on an empty tank
of gas versus a full tank of
gas. If the market is really set
up to move, then there will
be real volume coming into
the cash market to propel that
car “up and over” the hill. If
the market is just setting up a
head fake, then the volume in
the cash market will be low,
as there won’t be any real
conviction in the move.
Ignore the news and follow
the money. Table 7.1 shows



==================================================
                    PAGE 1528                     
==================================================

how I use this information to
manage my trades.
Table 7.1

==================================================
                    PAGE 1530                     
==================================================

There are many days
when three of the stocks are
trading under 30,000 shares
and another stock will be
trading 95,000 shares. In
these cases, I will first check
to see whether there is
specific news on that stock.
If there is, I will throw it out.
If there isn’t, I will then take
an average, call this a
“moderate” gap, and play it
accordingly— meaning that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1531                     
==================================================

my target on the first half
will be 50 percent of the gap
fill instead of holding on to
the entire position for a full
gap fill. For moderate gap
plays, I do not trail down the
original stop, even when I get
out of half my position.
What Are the Best Days of
the Week to Take This
Trade?
We keep a tab on raw gap



==================================================
                    PAGE 1532                     
==================================================

data, meaning the percentage
of the time that a gap fills,
regardless of how big the gap
was or how much premarket
volume traded. Just the clean,
raw, “it is what it is” data. In
Table 7.2, these data are
sorted by day of the week
and show what percentage of
the time the markets filled
their opening gaps on the
same day in which they were
created.



==================================================

==================================================
                    PAGE 1535                     
==================================================

As is evidenced by these
data, gaps in and of
themselves have a very high
probability of being filled on
the same day on which they
are created. If a person could
get these same odds at a
blackjack table, Las Vegas
would be put out of business
in three months. That said, it
is important to note that
Mondays are the days with
the lowest percentage of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1536                     
==================================================

filled gaps. The main reason
for this is that most
breakaway gaps happen on
Mondays—there are a lot of
developments that can
happen over the weekend.
On Mondays, I typically pass
on the gaps; in fact, I
typically just let the markets
open without me, in order to
give them a chance to “settle
in” before I start looking for
setups.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1537                     
==================================================

Finally, I’ve noticed that
expiration day (the third
Friday of every month) and
the first trading day of the
month have low
probabilities, in the range of
55 to 60 percent. I generally
pass on fading the gaps on
these two days. The only
exception is if the premarket
volume is very low. The
bottom line is that if the
premarket volume gets
confusing and a trader



==================================================
                    PAGE 1538                     
==================================================

doesn’t understand the
reading on any given day, the
odds are still there, and the
trade is worth taking.
What Are the Trading
Rules for Gaps?
Trading Rules for Gap Down
Buys (Gap Up Sells Are
Reversed)
This set of rules for gap
down buys is based on a gap



==================================================
                    PAGE 1539                     
==================================================

with low premarket volume.
If the volume is moderate,
then I will do exactly the
same thing, except that I will
take off half my position
when the markets reach the
price level that represents 50
percent of the gap fill. If the
premarket volume is high,
then I pass on this trade
setup. Remember, this is a
fade play. I will buy a gap
down and short a gap up. The
following set of rules is for a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1540                     
==================================================

gap down:
1. I first set up a special
intraday gap chart
that starts collecting
data at 9:30 a.m.
eastern and stops at
4:15 p.m. eastern.
This is so that I can
view the gaps.
These gaps won’t
appear on charts that
carry 24 hours’
worth of data or as



==================================================
                    PAGE 1541                     
==================================================

“regular session”
data on the futures
markets.
2. A gap must be at
least 10 YM points
or 1 ES point—
otherwise I will
pass.
3. If a gap is more than
70 YM points or 7
ES points, I pay
careful attention to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1542                     
==================================================

the premarket
volume. Most
breakaway gaps are
big gaps. However,
if the premarket
volume is low to
moderate, I will still
take these.
4. With a gap down,
when the regular
cash market opens
at 9:30 a.m. eastern,
I buy the YM or ES



==================================================
                    PAGE 1543                     
==================================================

at the market. The
DIA and SPY can
also be used. It
doesn’t really matter
which market is
utilized, with two
exceptions. First, if
one of the stocks in
the Dow is “out of
whack,” then I will
play the gap in the
S&Ps. By this I
mean that if a stock
like IBM is up 10



==================================================
                    PAGE 1544                     
==================================================

points on earnings,
then this index is
going to be out of
whack with the rest
of the markets. The
other exception is if
I am specifically
using the Dow in
another setup, say a
squeeze or a pivot
play (these are
discussed in
upcoming chapters).
Then I will take the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1545                     
==================================================

gap in the S&Ps.
This way, if I am
still in the gap play
when this next setup
fires off, I can just
take it in the Dow
and leave my gap
trade on.
5. Once filled, I set up
a protective sell stop
with the following
parameters:
• For gaps that are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1546                     
==================================================

under 40 YM or 4
ES points, I use a
1½:1 risk/reward
ratio. (For
example, for a 20-
point gap, I use a
30-point stop.)
• For gaps that are
over 40 YM or 4
ES points, I use a
1:1 risk/reward
ratio. (For
example, for a 45-



==================================================
                    PAGE 1547                     
==================================================

point gap, I use a
45-point stop.)
6. My target is the gap
fill itself. If
yesterday’s closing
price was 1058.50
on the S&Ps, then
that is my target for
the gap fill. For a
moderate-volume
gap, I will split this
order up, having
half my target at 50



==================================================
                    PAGE 1548                     
==================================================

percent of the gap
fill and leaving on
the remaining half
for a potential full
gap fill.
7. I don’t trail stops for
this setup.
8. If I’m stopped out,
then the gap play is
over for the day.
9. If neither the target



==================================================
                    PAGE 1549                     
==================================================

nor the stop is hit by
the closing bell, I
exit my position at
the market.
10. For the gap play,
there is only one
potential setup per
trading day.
Who Is Getting Hurt on
This Trade?
One of the most important
steps for traders is to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1550                     
==================================================

understand why they are
making money in a particular
trade—which also means
understanding who exactly is
losing money on the other
side of the trade. Who is
getting hurt and why?
When markets gap down,
there are generally two
groups that are going to get
hurt. First, there are the
people who are long from the
day before. When the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1551                     
==================================================

markets gap down, these
people are either getting
stopped out or panicking and
selling. Second, there are
people who are flat, see the
gap down, think it is the end
of the world, and start
shorting. In this setup, I want
to be on the opposite side of
the trade from both these
groups, because both of them
are having a strong emotional
reaction to the market, and
this emotion is causing them



==================================================
                    PAGE 1552                     
==================================================

to get into a trade. Therefore,
when they are selling, I am
buying. These same groups
will provide the fuel for the
rally through, in the case of
the first group, panic buying
in trying to make back their
early losses and, in the case
of the second group, short
covering via the stops they
placed when they put on their
short trade. Let’s take a look.
The charts that follow are
numbered in specific places



==================================================
                    PAGE 1553

where price action is taking
shape. Each of the lists that
refer to the chart is numbered
so that the text following “2”
describes point 2 in the chart
to which the text is referring.

Figure 7.1
2. On October 15, the
opening trade at
9:30 a.m. eastern is
9762, producing an
opening gap of +45
points. I “fade the
gap” right at the
open and short the
YM at the market.
My protective stop
is 45 points away

is the gap fill, which
is the previous day’s
close at 9717.
3. The gap fill is
complete once the
price levels reach
the previous day’s
close. This occurs
35 minutes after the
opening bell. This is
a relatively smooth

trade. I refer to these
quick fill gaps as
“Bahamas gaps”
because they are
relatively smooth,
quick, and stress-
free. This trade nets
a profit of $225 per
contract.

2. The opening trade at
9:30 a.m. eastern on
October 16 is 9645,
creating a 59-point
gap down. I buy at
these levels and
place a stop at 9586.
3. Many people who
play gaps would get
stopped out right
here at point 3, as



==================================================
                    PAGE 1562                     
==================================================

they would trail up
their stop to
breakeven to protect
their gains. For
these people, the
gap play is now
over.
4. Yet by holding on to
this play with
parameters that
were made
especially for gaps,
I end up staying in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1563                     
==================================================

profitable trades that
shake many other
traders out (see
Figure 7.3). The
reason for this is
that the other traders
are using blanket
types of parameters
for every play,
instead of utilizing
specific parameters
that are tailored for
specific plays.
Although many



==================================================
                    PAGE 1564                     
==================================================

gaps are filled
within the first hour,
many can take a
couple of hours or
more. I like to set
the parameters and
focus on something
else while the
market “does its
thing.” I refer to
gaps of this type as
“Somalia gaps.”
Unlike Bahamas
gaps, they tend to

                    PAGE 1565                     
==================================================

cause a lot of stress
in the people who
are watching them.
It’s okay to feel
stress; professional
traders simply don’t
act on it,
maintaining the
parameters they
have set for
themselves. This
trade nets out a
profit of $295 per
contract.

Note that one of the best
signs of an amateur trader is
a person who uses only tight
stops or a 3:1 risk/reward
ratio on every trade. Most
beginning traders are taught
by their brokers to use this
tight stop formula, risking 1
point to get 3 points. As the
traders wonder why they
always get stopped out just
before the market turns, their

broker is tallying up the
commissions generated on
the day. In general, wider
stops produce more winning
trades. The key with wider
stops, of course, is to play
only setups that have a
greater than 80 percent
chance of winning. The gap
play I’m describing, with the
parameters that I use, has a
greater than 80 percent
chance of winning with the
risk/reward ratios that I



==================================================
                    PAGE 1569                     
==================================================

utilize. When you use a tight
stop on a gap play, the
probabilities of the trade’s
working out fall dramatically
—to less than 30 percent. In
essence, one of the reasons
many traders fail to make it
in this business is that they
are using stops that are too
tight. This might seem like a
contradiction, but if almost
every trade is stopped out,
it’s tough to make any
money.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1570                     
==================================================

What is also important to
remember for gap plays is
that an active program of
trailing stops will negatively
affect your win/loss ratio.
Once the parameters are set
in place, the best thing a
trader can do is to walk away
and let the orders do their
job. Although tweaking is a
good thing to do when giving
a car a tune-up, tweaking the
parameters of a gap trade
won’t work.

I’ve found that most traders
get too caught up in the
reasons for the gap. In
reality, the reason is
meaningless. Gaps happen
because a flurry of emotion
hits the tape at the opening
bell. However, the reason for



==================================================
                    PAGE 1573                     
==================================================

the gap has little significance
with regard to whether or not
the gap fills. On Sunday,
August 1, 2004, the U.S.
government issued a terrorist
warning claiming that there
was chatter on the airwaves
about a plan to blow up a
large financial institution.
The markets got nervous, and
the markets gapped down in
a big way on Monday
morning, August 2 (see
Figure 7.4).

spend a good part of
the day chopping
around, and I talk
with other traders
who are nervous
about the terrorist
threat news. Do I let
this “nervousness”
get into my own
trading? Should I
listen to the reasons
for the gap?
3. Later that same day,

What’s the Secret to
Unfilled Gaps?
One important thing to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1590                     
==================================================

remember: if 80 percent of
these plays win, that means
that 20 percent of them lose.
I actually like losing trades
for one main reason: this
leaves an “open gap” in the
markets. An open gap is like
a black hole or a tractor
beam, eventually sucking
prices back to their opening
gap levels. Whenever the
markets leave an open gap, I
mark that level on a Post-it
note and place it on my



==================================================
                    PAGE 1591                     
==================================================

computer. Let’s look at an
example (see Figure 7.9).
Let’s get a little more
specific on how to play this,
using a $100,000 account
and utilizing nine contracts
for a full position, or
approximately one contract
for every $11,100 in the
account. Yes, a person can
trade a lot more contracts
than that in a $100,000
account, and many brokers



==================================================
                    PAGE 1592                     
==================================================

will encourage a person to
trade more than that. With
some brokers, a trader can
get enough leverage to trade
100 contracts on a $100,000
account. This is purely and
simply insane. Just because
people can do something
doesn’t mean they should.
The leverage here is far too
much. Traders who are using
a modest 2-point stop on the
S&Ps could get stopped out
four times in a row. Where



==================================================
                    PAGE 1593                     
==================================================

does this leave them? 2
points × $50 × 100 contracts
= $10,000. Four stops in a
row = $40,000. I’ve seen
more than my fair share of
people do this, and it is just
inexcusable. There are many
things people can do in life.
They can drink one glass of
wine or the whole bottle.
They can drink one cup of
coffee or the whole pot. They
can go to the gym each day
or sit and watch TV. It all



==================================================
                    PAGE 1594                     
==================================================

comes down to choice. Just
because people can do
something doesn’t mean that
it’s a good idea. Choose with
your best interests in mind.
Let’s go back to the example.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1595

Figure 7.9
On August 18, we gapped
up a modest 44 points in the
Dow prior to some economic
numbers. I shorted at the
open. We rallied, sold off
into the economic numbers,
and then shot higher once the
numbers were released. I had
a 44-point stop, and the
markets rallied just through
that level, producing a loss of
$220 per contract, or $1,980.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1597                     
==================================================

I headed into the next
trading day knowing that
there was now a “black hole”
gap below. I could actually
hear the sucking sound. The
next day we had a modest
low-volume 13-point gap
higher that worked out
quickly for $65 per contract
($585). The day after, we got
a nice 52-point gap lower
that took a few hours to fill,
but created few headaches,
for $260 per contract



==================================================
                    PAGE 1598                     
==================================================

($2,340). The next day we
got a 44-point gap higher that
was on moderate volume. It
came close to our stop, but
eventually filled the gap for
$255 per contract on four
contracts. I covered the first
five contracts when we got to
50 percent of the gap fill
level, which was 22 points. 4
contracts × 44 points × $5 =
$880, and 5 contracts × 22
points × $5 = $550, for a
total of $1,430 on the play.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1599                     
==================================================

Finally, on August 22, we
got the “sucker gap” when
Intel announced “cautious
upside earnings revisions.”
The market exploded and
gapped up 62 points, right
into key resistance—on low
premarket volume.
I shorted the gap. Six bars
later, my target was hit for 62
points, or $310 per contract
($2,790). The sucking sound
of the black hole below was



==================================================
                    PAGE 1600                     
==================================================

getting louder. During the
afternoon session, we got a
bear flag consolidation. I set
up a sell stop at 9392 to let
the market take me into a
breakdown of that flag
formation. I got the fill and
set my stop above intraday
resistance at 9455. My target
was the August 18 black hole
open gap at 9304. The
market spent the rest of the
day on its hands and knees,
dry heaving, trying to hold



==================================================
                    PAGE 1601                     
==================================================

back the internal pressure.
This pressure proved to be
too much, and, like a
freshman college student
during his first year away
from home, the market
eventually fell over and
vomited. The gap filled for
an 88-point gain, or $440 per
contract ($3,960).
When there are open gaps
left in the market, I always
write them down and mark



==================================================
                    PAGE 1602                     
==================================================

them on my chart. The
markets will take them out
eventually, usually within 5
to 10 trading days.
What Are the Best
Strategies for People Who
Can’t Trade Full Time?
Gaps are one of the best
strategies for people who are
holding down a full-time job.
On the West Coast, this is
particularly easy, as the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1603                     
==================================================

markets are open well before
most people have to head to
the office. The main
consideration to keep in mind
is that a person will want a
trading platform (see Chapter
4) that will automatically
cancel a stop once the target
is hit. Another, often
overlooked alternative is to
have a broker who can be
called with the parameters.
Typically these brokers will
cost a little more in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1604                     
==================================================

commissions, but it is worth
it to have someone watching
out for the trade. The biggest
advantage of doing this trade
as a part-time trader is that
you won’t be prone to
making the very mistakes
most full-time traders make
while watching the trade
progress. They get antsy,
they get fidgety, and they end
up bailing out too soon.
Someone who is at the office
and doesn’t have time to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1605                     
==================================================

watch the trade actually has a
big edge over most of the
traders who haven’t learned
to control their emotions.
How Does a Trader Position
Size for This Setup?
One frequent question I get
is, “How many contracts or
shares are you trading with
this strategy?” These same
plays can be executed in five
different markets. There are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1606                     
==================================================

the mini-sized Dow and E-
mini S&P futures, the SPY
and DIA ETF shares, and
also futures on the DIA
available through One
Chicago. Table 7.3 shows the
different instruments and the
number of shares or contracts
I would trade on a $100,000
account using this setup. The
DIA futures are nice if a
trader is using a smaller
account. They are a happy
medium between having a lot



==================================================
                    PAGE 1607                     
==================================================

of leverage with the
minisized Dow and E-mini
S&P futures and having no
leverage with the DIA and
SPY stock. The example
shown in Table 7.3 is with a
gap that occurred on July 24.

Summing Up the Gaps
Gaps are the one moment of
the trading day where all the
players have to show their
poker hand, and this creates
the single biggest advantage
for the short-term trader.
Understanding the
psychology behind the gaps
is paramount for playing
them successfully on a daily
basis. The gaps are so



==================================================
                    PAGE 1610                     
==================================================

powerful that many traders
make a nice living playing
these setups alone. The key is
to know how they work and
to develop a solid
methodology and set of rules
to trade them. One
consideration to keep in mind
while playing gaps is the 50
percent retracement level. At
the beginning of this chapter,
I mentioned that I would take
half of my position off when
there is moderate premarket



==================================================
                    PAGE 1611                     
==================================================

volume. The reality is, the 50
percent retracement level is
the highest-probability exit
on any gap. It is okay to
modify your trading plan to
take off half your profits on
any gap that reaches the 50
percent retracement level,
regardless of whether
premarket volume was
moderate or low.
After reading about this
setup and understanding the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1612                     
==================================================

specifics behind it, the
serious trader will have a
better foundation for a plan
to trade the markets
successfully on a full-time
basis: a proven setup to play,
markets that best fit that
setup, and a plan of action to
maximize the play. That is
pretty much all a trader needs
in order to survive and thrive
in this greatest of
professions.

What Is the Best Way to
Beat Indicator-Based
Traders?
One of the simplest and most
effective position entry
techniques that I use is based
on what I call the multipivot
levels, which consist of the
daily, weekly, and monthly
pivot points, along with the
midpoints between the daily
levels. This is a setup I use
primarily on the stock index



==================================================
                    PAGE 1616                     
==================================================

futures, although they can
also be utilized on some
individual stocks (the big
names), as well as the
corresponding stock index
ETFs via the DIA, SPY,
QQQ, and IWM. In addition,
I like to use the weekly
pivots on most other futures
contracts, such as gold,
currencies, oil, and so forth.
The daily pivots on these are
okay, but I’ve found that the
weekly levels hold much



==================================================
                    PAGE 1617                     
==================================================

better on these other
commodities. Like the gap
play, the pivot play hasn’t
changed much since this
book first came out, and I’ve
left the examples here intact
that still ring true today.
The main advantage of
this system is that it is price-
based rather than indicator-
based. By the time most
indicators generate a buy or a
sell signal, the move is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1618                     
==================================================

already well under way. By
following this price-based
methodology, I will get into a
trade before the indicator-
based traders, and I usually
end up handing off my
position soon after a buy or
sell signal is being generated
on a stochastic or other
oscillator type of system.
This is especially true on
choppy days. Just as the
Johnnycome-latelies are
jumping in, I’m closing out



==================================================
                    PAGE 1619                     
==================================================

my position and looking for
the next setup. On choppy
days, it’s the indicator-based
traders who get taken out
back and shot. Their buy
signals get them in at the top
of the move, and their sell
signals get them in at the
dead lows, leading to a
frustrating day with a
negative P&L. Pivots are set
up to naturally take
advantage of their mistakes,
essentially siphoning money



==================================================
                    PAGE 1620                     
==================================================

from these trading accounts
into your own.
This is also a good system
for traders who don’t have
time to stare at the charts all
day long or, not surprisingly,
for traders who have a bad
habit of chasing the market
higher and lower. Playing the
pivots automatically creates
trader discipline, because the
entries and exits are
determined before the trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1621                     
==================================================

day even starts.
The other thing I like
about the pivots is that they
can be used as a tool to
quickly determine what kind
of trading day it’s going to
be. On a trending day,
markets will move to a pivot
level, consolidate for 15 to
20 minutes, and then
continue to march in the
direction of the trend. On
these days, I wait for the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1622                     
==================================================

move through the pivot level
and then buy the first
pullback to that level. On
choppy days, however, the
markets will move up to a
pivot level, hang around for a
short time, and then drift
back in the direction whence
they came. Many traders get
“chopped up” during these
types of trading days, losing
money and making their
brokers rich in the process.
The pivots are naturally set



==================================================
                    PAGE 1623                     
==================================================

up to be faded on these days
and are one of the few
profitable ways to trade the
low-volume, narrow-range
chop.
There are two very easy
ways to tell whether the
market is trending or
chopping. The first is to look
at how the market reacts to
the pivot levels once it
reaches them. The second is
to set up a five-minute chart



==================================================
                    PAGE 1624                     
==================================================

of the E-mini S&Ps and see
what kind of volume is
coming into the market after
10:00 a.m. eastern (see
Chapter 6). If the volume is
more than 25,000 contracts
on each bar, then the market
has power and volatility
behind it. These types of
days usually have wide
ranges and strong trends.
However, if the volume after
10:00 a.m. eastern is
consistently below 25,000



==================================================
                    PAGE 1625                     
==================================================

contracts on a five-minute
chart, then there is little
power to move the beast, and
the end result will be a slow,
choppy day. On the first type
of day, I wait for the markets
to move through pivot levels,
and then I set up an order to
get in on the first
retracement. On the choppy
days, I place open buy and
sell orders against the pivots
and have standing orders to
fade these moves throughout



==================================================
                    PAGE 1626                     
==================================================

the day. There is nothing to
watch on these types of days,
so I generally let my orders
do the work for me while I
spend some quality time at
the driving range. Is there a
bonus play? On a choppy
day, a high or low $TICK
reading (+1,000 or –1,000)
right into a pivot level. That
is, the market rallies right
into a key pivot, and during
that rally, a +1,000 $TICK
reading is reached,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1627                     
==================================================

exhausting all of the buying
pressure. Bingo. That is the
short setup of the day.
Why Aren’t All Pivots
Created Equal?
So what exactly are the
pivots? There is no big
mystery or secret to them,
and many readers will have
heard about them and have
used them in their own
trading on a regular basis.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1628                     
==================================================

For the uninitiated, I explain
how I set them up and why
they work, and then we can
jump into the setups that I
use with them.
Pivots are readily
available and have been
around for a long time. They
are support and resistance
levels calculated by floor
traders using a simple
mathematical formula. These
levels became widely known



==================================================
                    PAGE 1629                     
==================================================

and have moved off the floor.
Today many traders are
aware of them and try to use
them, but in my experience,
they are using them
incorrectly. To add to the
confusion, there are different
formula versions and
different time frames that are
used when calculating pivots.
So, to get started, let’s look
at what I use, which is one of
the standard pivot formulas:



==================================================
                    PAGE 1630                     
==================================================

Once a trader has this
formula, then the key data
needed are the high, low, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1631                     
==================================================

close of the previous session.
For my own trading, I like to
utilize 24 hours’ worth of
data to capture the highs and
lows. However, it is
absolutely imperative to use
the settlement price for the
close, as this is the only
closing price that matters.
Often a 24-hour setting on a
chart means “midnight to
midnight,” and that will
destroy the validity of the
data. We will go over this in



==================================================
                    PAGE 1632                     
==================================================

more detail shortly.
Once I get this high, low,
and close, I plug them into an
Excel spreadsheet with the
formulas listed previously.
This information generates
seven important levels for the
next trading day: a central
pivot, then three levels above
(R1, R2, and R3) and three
levels below (S1, S2, and
S3). The central pivot has the
most weight of the seven



==================================================
                    PAGE 1633                     
==================================================

levels. In addition to these
daily levels, I also utilize the
midpoints between these
levels. Finally, I like to know
where the weekly and
monthly levels are located.
These are calculated by
taking the high, low, and
close of the previous weekly
or monthly bar. While the
daily pivots change each day,
the weekly pivots change
only once a week, and the
monthly pivots only once a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1634                     
==================================================

month. As a side note,
indicators can also be
programmed with these
formulas so that the pivots
are set up automatically on
your charts without the need
for you to do it all manually
each morning—though doing
it all manually does make
you remember where those
pivots are located.
It is important to note that
it is rare for a stock index to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1635                     
==================================================

hit its daily R3 or S3 level.
This is important to know
because if a market rallies to
R2 or sells off to S2, that
usually ends up being the
dead high or the dead low for
the day. This knowledge will
help temper a trader’s
emotions and keep him on
track to follow this system.
This is, of course, under
normal market conditions. As
I’m updating this in
September 2011, the $VIX is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1636                     
==================================================

at 40.00 and the markets are
incredibly volatile, regularly
testing the R3 and S3 levels.
The lower the $VIX, the
tighter the ranges.
How Exactly Should I Set
Up the Pivots on My
Charts?
I’m going to go through the
process of how I update the
pivots on my charts each day.
This is based on updated

                    PAGE 1637                     
==================================================

exchange trading hours as of
September 29, 2011. To
calculate the daily pivot
numbers, I use the following
data to generate my high,
low, and close numbers:
• YM: Start Wednesday at
4:30 p.m. eastern; end
4:15 p.m. on Thursday
• ES: Start Wednesday at
4:30 p.m. eastern; end
4:15 p.m. on Thursday



==================================================
                    PAGE 1638                     
==================================================

• NQ: Start Wednesday at
4:30 p.m. eastern; end
4:15 p.m. on Thursday
• TF: Start Wednesday at
8:00 p.m. eastern; 6:00
p.m. on Thursday
This range of data gives
me all the price action for
when these markets are
trading, allowing both pre-
and postmarket price action
to be factored into the next



==================================================
                    PAGE 1639                     
==================================================

trading day’s numbers. The
times are slightly different on
the different contracts
because of the times they are
traded on the exchange. The
settlement price is the key. If
traders are ever unsure about
the settlement price, they can
check it for the YM, ES, and
NQ at www.cmegroup.com.
For the TF, go to
www.theice.com.
The easiest way to get an



==================================================
                    PAGE 1640                     
==================================================

accurate high, low, and close
is to just set up a daily chart
with the time frames listed
for each contract. In
TradeStation, this is very
easy to do. Just enter the
continuous symbol, such as
@YM or @ES, and set it on
a daily chart. The data will
default to the “regular
session,” which refers to the
times listed earlier. With
many other charting
programs, a trader has to go



==================================================
                    PAGE 1641                     
==================================================

in and set this up manually,
as many of them default to
the regular stock market
session from 9:30 a.m. to
4:00 p.m. eastern. Once the
chart is set up, just wait for
the 4:15 p.m. eastern close
on the ES, NQ, and YM and
wait until after 6:00 p.m.
eastern on the TF. After these
times, the markets will then
reopen shortly with a new
daily bar. Just take the high,
low, and close reading on the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1642                     
==================================================

daily bar generated for that
trading day to get the correct
numbers. This closing price
will almost always match the
settlement price, although I
like to check to make sure.
For Monday, then, I want the
high, low, and close for
Friday. Let’s take a look (see
Figure 8.1).



==================================================
                    PAGE 1643                     
==================================================

                    PAGE 1644                     
==================================================

Figure 8.1
On Friday, March 18,
2005, we have a daily bar on
the YM that started after the
4:15 p.m. eastern close (it
starts again when the market
reopens at 4:30 p.m. eastern)
on Thursday, March 17, and
ended at 4:15 p.m. eastern on
Friday, March 18. This range
gives us the following
numbers:



==================================================
                    PAGE 1645                     
==================================================

• High: 10,679
• Low: 10,579
• Close: 10,635
By changing the chart to a
weekly time frame, I can also
take the high, low, and close
of the completed weekly bar
and get the numbers I will
use for the weekly pivots.
• High: 10,870
• Low: 10,579



==================================================
                    PAGE 1646                     
==================================================

• Close: 10,635
On Monday, the daily and
weekly close will be
identical, since they are both
based on Friday’s close. In
this instance, the lows are
also identical because the
lows on Friday were also the
lows of the week. The
process can be repeated with
the monthly levels, but I
won’t need new monthly
inputs until the first trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 1647                     
==================================================

day in April.
Now that I have my key
levels, I want to figure out
the key pivot points that I’ll
be using for Monday, March
21, 2005. The first thing I do
is take these high, low, and
close figures and plug them
into the formula. To figure
out the daily pivot, I take the
high + low + close and divide
by 3:
. We now have our pivot



==================================================
                    PAGE 1648                     
==================================================

point for the day. To figure
out R1, which is the next
level above the pivot, I
multiply the pivot by 2, and
then subtract the low. So we
take – the
low at .
We continue this process
until we are done, and we
come up with the following
levels:
• R3: 10,783



==================================================
                    PAGE 1649                     
==================================================

• R2: 10,731
• R1: 10,683
• Pivot: 10,631
• S1: 10,583
• S2: 10,531
• S3: 10,483
Once I have these levels, I
place them on my chart. I
also like to note the
midpoints between the daily
pivot levels. These are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1650                     
==================================================

calculated very simply, as
they are literally the
midpoint. The pivot is
10,631, and R1 is 10,683, 52
points away. Half of 52 is 26.
I add that to the pivot, and I
get a midpoint of 10,657.
These are all formulas that
can be set up in Excel,
making this a very quick and
easy process. I don’t
calculate the midpoints for
the weekly and monthly
levels.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1651                     
==================================================

Once I have created the
chart and added the
appropriate pivot levels, the
first thing I will note is where
the daily pivot is in relation
to where the market closed.
The daily pivot is at 10,631,
and the market closed at
10,635. The second thing I
will be watching for is where
the markets are trading at
9:30 a.m. eastern on
Monday. How far away are
they from the daily pivot?



==================================================
                    PAGE 1652                     
==================================================

This will work in relation to
the gap play. The markets
test their daily pivot level at
some point during the day 90
percent of the time. I will
always fade the first move to
the daily pivot. For example,
if the markets are trading
above the central daily pivot,
and they sell off to this level,
I will fade the move by
buying it when it reaches the
pivot. I will talk about
specific entry methods in a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1653                     
==================================================

moment.
By setting up these
formulas in an Excel
template, I can quickly
obtain all the key levels for
the YM, ES, NQ, and TF. I
did that, and all I do today is
just enter the high, low, and
close. Once this is done, the
spreadsheet fills in the rest of
the numbers for me
automatically. It takes me
just a few minutes to look up



==================================================
                    PAGE 1654                     
==================================================

the high, low, and close and
then plug them into this
spreadsheet. I then instantly
have my levels for the next
trading day. Of course, I
have to update the weekly
pivots only once a week, and
the monthly pivots once a
month. The spreadsheet for
the chart we are working on
is shown in Figure 8.2.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1655                     
==================================================

                    PAGE 1656                     
==================================================

Figure 8.2
I also like to note where
the extreme levels are,
because it is very rare for the
stock indexes to hit their R3
or S3 level. This is important
to know because if the
markets rally to R2 or sell off
to S2, that usually ends up
being the dead high or the
dead low of the day. This
knowledge will help temper a
trader’s emotions. When a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1657                     
==================================================

market is going up, it is easy
to think that it will go up
forever. On this same note,
when the market is heading
down quickly, it is easy to
assume that it’s the end of
the world. The emotion of
greed is, of course, a disaster
for anyone who succumbs to
it because of the surge of
adrenaline that runs through
the body. By understanding
the odds of a move above
and beyond these outer



==================================================
                    PAGE 1658                     
==================================================

levels, a trader will be able to
stay more objective and take
the money away from the
people who are panicking.
The pivots help to keep a
trader grounded. Instead of
getting overexcited and
hoping for a market crash,
the pivot trader knows that
there is a 90 percent chance
that the markets will not
close above R2 or below S2
on any given day. A move to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1659                     
==================================================

that level signals a time for
the trader to take profits
instead of pyramiding into a
bigger position that will lead
to disaster.
Let’s take a look at the
pivot levels that we
calculated for Monday,
March 21, 2005, on a five-
minute chart (see Figure 8.3).
This chart looks very
busy, with the daily pivot
levels labeled on the left, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1660                     
==================================================

midpoints of the daily levels
in the middle, and the weekly
pivot levels on the right. For
the sake of space, I left the
monthly levels off. I like to
take a look at this wide view
first in order to see where the
extreme levels are located for
Monday’s trading. Once I’ve
done that, I will then reduce
the chart to a more
manageable level (see Figure
8.4).



==================================================
                    PAGE 1661                     
==================================================

In this chart, I’ve zoomed
in so that I can see where the
key close levels are for
Monday’s trading.
The Psychology Behind the
Pivots—Who Is Getting
Burned?
Before I jump into the rules
and specific setups that I use
to trade the pivots, I want to
cover briefly why they work.
The first, and most obvious,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1662                     
==================================================

reason is that a lot of traders
watch these daily levels, so
there is a self-fulfilling
prophecy involved. However,
the same can be said for
Fibonacci levels, but they do
not hold nearly as well as the
pivots. Why? I elaborate on
this in the next two points.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1663

==================================================

Figure 8.4
On the floor, it is
generally a trader’s goal to
grab smaller moves, typically
2 points in the S&P 500,
which is about 20 points in
the Dow, or smaller
depending on what is going
on in the pit. The floor
traders all operate in a big
circle, with the brokers
standing on the first step that
surrounds the pit. This gives



==================================================
                    PAGE 1667                     
==================================================

them the best view of all the
locals so that they can get the
best price for their
customers. Since it is easier
to trade with someone who is
right in front of you, the
prime space for locals to
stand is just inside the top
rail that separates the top-
step brokers from the locals.
Experience, politics (whom
you know), and the ability to
take orders of all sizes (not
just single lots) can get a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1668                     
==================================================

local a prime position near
the top-step brokers. Usually
this space is determined by
how long the local has “held
the spot” and his ability to
continue to make markets.
New traders must find space
where available. This is
usually at the farthest point
from the brokers, which is
the center of the pit. Because
of this layout, there are
several different scenarios
being traded at one time. The



==================================================
                    PAGE 1669                     
==================================================

locals on one side of the pit
are making markets based on
order flow coming from the
brokers on their side of the
pit. If a broker in one corner
is selling size (a very large
position) while a broker on
the other side of the pit is
buying, the two brokers don’t
always hear each other or
even know what the other
side is doing. It would be
very easy for them to do their
trade together if they knew



==================================================
                    PAGE 1670                     
==================================================

that they could meet each
other’s needs. Instead, locals
near the broker who is
buying start “racing” the
broker by buying from other
nearby brokers and then
turning around and selling
their contracts to him. This
causes many price
fluctuations throughout the
day and often results in the
public’s getting stopped out
before the action settles
down again. In its purest



==================================================
                    PAGE 1671                     
==================================================

form, the traders on the
outside will get in on a trade,
let’s say it’s a long, and then
sell their position to the guys
on the inside of the circle
who can’t really see what is
happening way out on the top
steps. What happens is that
the traders on the inside, by
the time they see the market
moving, are the last ones in
the pit to get in on the move.
If they are lucky, they will
then be able to turn around



==================================================
                    PAGE 1672                     
==================================================

and sell it to the public. As
the guys on the inside are
selling to the public and
closing their positions, the
guys on the outside are also
selling to the public, but they
are opening new short
positions, essentially fading a
public that is chasing the up
move. And the cycle renews
itself like this throughout the
day. This causes a specific
dynamic in the markets,
generating specific cycles of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1673                     
==================================================

speed and rest on an intraday
basis. The traders focus on
the pivot levels to base their
entries and to also gauge
market action. The pivots
play on this in that they are
spaced out to catch these
“patches of momentum.”
Dow pivots are usually 30 to
50 points apart, and this is
the type of movement that
perpetuates the cycle I just
described. The floor traders

                    PAGE 1674                     
==================================================

catching half this move,
dumping it, and waiting for
the next level to be hit. The
key is to get in when the
market is quiet and get
positioned for the next round
of activity.
One of the main reasons
that these pivots work has to
do with the inexperience of
the vast majority of traders
out there. The floor traders
start a trade, and the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1675                     
==================================================

inexperience of most traders
causes the momentum that
finishes a trade. How?
Because average traders rely
on a lot of different
“indicators.” They are getting
into and out of their positions
far too late, which causes
losing trades and leads to a
specific cycle of market
movement as their stop
placement slowly and
steadily increases the
velocity of market movement



==================================================
                    PAGE 1676                     
==================================================

in the direction of their stops.
Indicators are just that, an
“indication.” This is like
your significant other
slapping you across the face,
and you taking it as an
“indication” that this person
might be angry with you. If it
takes a slap across the face
for you to realize this, then
you are following the wrong
indicators. By the way, all
market indicators are the
wrong indicators, because



==================================================
                    PAGE 1677                     
==================================================

they are all lagging. Price
action is pure. This
overreliance on indicators by
the majority of traders is
what helps this system to
work. By the time the
average trader gets a buy
signal, the pivot play is
almost over, and users of this
system will be selling their
position to the indicator-
based traders. Then the
subsequent reversal that
takes place results from all



==================================================
                    PAGE 1678                     
==================================================

the stop losses sitting out
there, like trout sunning
themselves at the top of a
lake—easy targets for the
hawks who come swooping
down from overhead. The
market pauses, drifts down,
then picks up steam and rips
through all the stop losses,
pausing when the run is over.
This pause generally happens
at a pivot level. It’s where
the floor traders are
beginning to accumulate



==================================================
                    PAGE 1679                     
==================================================

their next position for the
next cycle of play.
Let’s jump into the
trading rules and look at
some setups.
What Are the Trading
Rules for Pivot Buys on
Trending Days?
Sells, of course, are reversed.
1. Unlike with the gap
charts, I want to see



==================================================
                    PAGE 1680                     
==================================================

24 hours’ worth of
data, so that I can
view any overnight
highs and lows.
Each day I update
the appropriate
pivot levels on the
charts to reflect the
previous day’s
action. On
Mondays, I also
update the weekly
pivots, and on the
first trading day of a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1681                     
==================================================

new month, I update
the monthly pivots.
2. The first pivot play
is done in
conjunction with the
gap, if there is one.
If there is a gap
down, then I buy a
decline into the
closest pivot level.
If there isn’t a
playable gap (more
than 10 YM points



==================================================
                    PAGE 1682                     
==================================================

or 1 ES point), then
I will wait until 9:45
a.m. eastern to
initiate the first
play.
3. If the volume on the
five-minute ES
chart is more than
25,000 contracts,
then I’ll wait for the
markets to penetrate
a pivot level and
move up at least a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1683                     
==================================================

quarter of the way
to the next pivot
level. Once this
happens, I will then
set up a bid to buy
the first retracement
back to the violated
pivot level.
4. I enter my trades
with limit orders
only. I place orders
“just in front of” the
pivot. For the YM, I



==================================================
                    PAGE 1684                     
==================================================

use 3 points; for the
ES, 0.25 point; for
the NQ, 0.50 point;
for the TF, 0.20
point; and for
individual stocks, 5
cents. For example,
if I’m trading the
YM and the pivot
level is 10,000, then
I would buy a
decline to 10,003
and short a rally to
9997. Sometimes



==================================================
                    PAGE 1685                     
==================================================

the pivot will be an
odd number, such as
1117.38 on the ES.
In this case, I
always round in the
direction of the
trade. So, if I’m
bidding for a long, I
will round 1117.38
to 1117.50, and my
bid will be 1117.75.
If I’m offering a
short, I will round
1117.38 down to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1686                     
==================================================

1117.25 and place
my offer at 1117.00.
My stops and
targets, then, would
be “just in front of”
these appropriate
long and short
levels.
5. Once filled, I place
an order to close the
first half at the next
pivot level and the
second half at the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1687                     
==================================================

pivot level after
that, using the same
“just in front of”
parameters.
6. I place a stop at 20
points for the YM, 2
points for the ES, 4
points for the NQ,
and 1.50 points for
the Russell. For
stocks, I will use a
stop based roughly
on the price of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1688                     
==================================================

stock. If the stock is
under $10 a share, I
will use a stop of 20
cents. If it is
between $10 and
$20, I will use a
stop of 30 cents; if it
is between $20 and
$30, I will use a
stop of 40 cents, and
so on, adding
another 10 cents for
each $10 increment
in price. (A $75



==================================================
                    PAGE 1689                     
==================================================

stock would have an
80-cent stop, for
example.)
7. If the first target is
hit, I will then move
up the stop to my
entry-level pivot,
minus the “just in
front of” fractions
discussed in rule 3.
For example, if I get
in a YM long at
10,003 and the pivot



==================================================
                    PAGE 1690                     
==================================================

is at 10,000, then
my new stop would
be 9997 once the
first target is hit.
8. If I am in a trade at
the market close and
neither my stop nor
my target has been
hit, I will close out
my position “at the
market” at 4:10 p.m.
eastern for futures,
and at 3:58 p.m.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1691                     
==================================================

eastern for stocks.
9. I don’t initiate any
new positions after
3:30 p.m. eastern,
but I will manage
existing positions
into the close.
10. The markets rarely
have a sustained
move above R3 or
below S3. If I trade
to those levels, I



==================================================
                    PAGE 1692                     
==================================================

will always fade the
move.
11. After two losers in a
row, I’m done with
pivots for the day.
What Are the Trading
Rules for Pivot Buys on
Choppy Days?
Once again, sells are the
same, just reversed. The rules
for choppy days are identical
except for the targets. On



==================================================
                    PAGE 1693                     
==================================================

choppy days, I just focus on
the YM and the ES. My first
target is mechanical: 10
points for the YM and 1
point for the ES on half of
my position. Once this is hit,
I will trail up my stop in the
same way I would for a
trending trade. The second
target becomes the “just in
front of” level for the actual
next pivot level. In working
with other traders, I’ve found
that they grasp the concept of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1694                     
==================================================

the “choppy day” setup
easily, but they struggle with
the “trending day” setup.
Therefore, I focus most of
the examples on the trending
day setups, and we go
through those first.

1. The S&Ps gap down
into daily S1 (see
Figure 8.5). I have a
limit order to buy
placed at 1114.00,
just above daily S1.
The market comes
very close to this
level, but not close
enough. I am not

the market pushes
up through the
midpoint, I move
my bid to buy the
next pullback to the
midpoint. The
midpoint is at
1115.88, so I get a
little in front by
placing an order to
buy at 1116.25. I am
filled quickly at this

buy a pullback to

I am filled, and I
place a 2-point stop
at 1116.25. My stop
is hit. The market
rallies back through
the pivot, and I
place another order
to buy a pullback to

and I place the same
2-point stop at

of my position at
1122.00, just in
front of the next
pivot level. Once
the market pushes
decisively through
this pivot level, I
place a bid to buy at

R1. I am not filled,
and the market goes
on to make new
highs. At this point
it is past 3:30 p.m.

filled, and when it
moves up through
the midpoint, I raise
my bid to 1386.50. I

orders in place and
go grab some lunch.
By the time I get
back, I’m still not
filled, which is why
I absolutely love the
low-volume August
trading. It takes a
couple of hours, but
I end up getting
filled later in the
afternoon. I place a

is hit quickly, and I
move my stop down
to 10,041.
4. My second target is
hit at 9988, and I’m
now flat. Since the
market continues to
trend lower, I place
a bid to short at the
next overhead pivot

This is a rare event.
The markets hardly
ever get through R3,

initial moves to

Trending versus Choppy
Markets
For the most part, the setups
we just went through cover
trending markets. I also
wanted to take a look at



==================================================
                    PAGE 1766                     
==================================================

choppy markets to show how
the pivots work under those
circumstances. Figure 8.16
shows the mini-sized Dow on
a day when it stayed locked
in a confined, narrow trading
range through the majority of
the day. In fact, most of the
initial move down happened
before the 9:30 a.m. eastern
open for the cash markets. I
also inserted some basic
indicators onto this chart to
show how far they can lag



==================================================
                    PAGE 1767                     
==================================================

behind on a choppy day
compared with a setup that is
based purely on price. The
indicators I’m looking at are
basic exponential moving
averages as well as an RSI
index. This doesn’t mean that
these indicators don’t have
any value—it’s just
important to keep in mind
that for the most part, an
indicator-only-based trading
approach is a lagging
approach, and this fact is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1768

Figure 8.16
1. As the markets chop

becomes the
appropriate time to
set up the pivot

enhanced” manner
(see Figure 8.17).
At point 1, the YM
is quiet, and I am
looking to fade a
move to the nearest
pivot level. I don’t
want to sit and stare
at the markets while
this mind-numbing
action unfolds.
Therefore, I place a
buy limit order at
the nearest pivot



==================================================
                    PAGE 1772

level below the
current price action,
plus 3 points, so I’m
just in front of the
pivot. I also place a
sell limit order at
the next level above
current price action.

2. The sell limit order
is hit first. I came
close to the buy
limit order, but I
didn’t quite make it.
Once the sell limit
order is hit, I place a
20-point stop. My
first target is a
mechanical 10
points away from



==================================================
                    PAGE 1775                     
==================================================

my entry, and my
second target is the
next pivot level
below. It is a weekly
pivot level at
10,532, so I would
set up a buy limit
order at 10,535 to
cover the second
half of my short.
3. Both of my targets
are hit, and I am
taken out of the

                    PAGE 1776                     
==================================================

trade. Note that
when the moving
averages finally
crossed over, the
markets were almost
at our final target.
Indicators like
moving averages
work amazingly
well on trending
days, but they are a
killer on choppy
days. Price rules on
the choppy days.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1777                     
==================================================

This example shows
something that traders will
notice quite often when they
trade this system: they will
be trading exactly the same
levels multiple times during a
given day. The level at which
a trader would get long on a
decline is also the level at
which the trader would close
out a short, and vice versa.
Let’s take another look at
the same chart (Figure 8.17),



==================================================
                    PAGE 1778                     
==================================================

but we’ll look at all the
setups that occurred that day.
1. At point 1, the YM
falls to one of the
weekly levels, but
doesn’t quite touch
it. I manage to get
into the market long
because my limit
buy order is the
weekly level + 3
points. The weekly
level is 10,532, so



==================================================
                    PAGE 1779                     
==================================================

my limit buy order
is placed at 10,535.
I’m out for +10
points quickly on
the first half, and
then I bring my stop
up to “pivot – 3,”
which is breakeven
– 6.
2. At point 2, we come
up and ease just
through the daily
midpoint. I am out



==================================================
                    PAGE 1780                     
==================================================

of the second half of
my long on a limit
order to this level.
Note that the
moving averages
have barely crossed
higher when the
markets have
reached the target. I
try to reverse and
short, but the market
moves too quickly,
and I miss the short.
One way around



==================================================
                    PAGE 1781                     
==================================================

this is to keep a
resting order in for
the stop and also for
a new position. If
traders are long 10
contracts and want
to reverse and go
short when they
exit, then they just
set a sell limit order
for 20 contracts.
This way, they will
exit their long and
establish a short



==================================================
                    PAGE 1782                     
==================================================

position
simultaneously.
3. For point 3, I am
bidding long for a
decline back at the
weekly level + 3
points. The weekly
level is 10,532, so
my bid is that plus 3
points, which is
10,535. When two
levels are close
together like this (by



==================================================
                    PAGE 1783                     
==================================================

at least 10 points—
in this case a weekly
level and the daily
pivot), I will place
my bid based on the
level closest to the
price action. I am
filled on my long.
The market eases
through and trades
around this level for
half an hour. My
stop is not hit,
although it comes



==================================================
                    PAGE 1784                     
==================================================

close. My initial
target for “half at 10
points” is hit
quickly, and I trail
my stop. It is not
until a couple of
hours later that my
second target is hit
at the midpoint.
This is an important
note: some of these
trades will last a few
hours in duration,
while others can last



==================================================
                    PAGE 1785                     
==================================================

10 minutes. The key
is to wait for the
levels to be reached
and not try to hurry
things along or get
out because of
anxiety or boredom.
Although human
emotions are a good
idea in building
relationships with
other people, in
trading, they have to
be ignored.

4. I am out of the
second half of my
long more than three
hours later, at a
daily midpoint level.
Since this is a
choppy day, I just
reverse and go
short, placing the
target on the first
half of my position
10 points away from
my entry. My

==================================================

next level below + 3
points.
5. The market actually
moves quickly, and
I’m out of the first
half in 15 minutes,
and the second half
another 15 minutes
after that. I reverse
and go long and set
up the same
parameters: +10
points on the first



==================================================
                    PAGE 1788                     
==================================================

half, and back to the
other pivot on the
second half.
6. I’m out of the first
half quickly for +10,
and the market
continues to trek
higher into the
close. The market
doesn’t quite reach
my second target,
and I end up getting
out at the market at



==================================================
                    PAGE 1789                     
==================================================

4:10 p.m. eastern, a
few points below
my target. Note
again that by the
time the moving
averages crossed
higher, I was
already out of half
my position.
Trailing Stops in This
Fashion Is the Key
I’m not a big fan of



==================================================
                    PAGE 1790                     
==================================================

aggressively trailing stops.
By this I mean that if the
market moves in my favor by
1 YM point, I will keep my
stop static instead of trailing
it up by 1 point. This auto-
trailing stop strategy
generally will stop a trader
out on the first normal
retracement, and these are
moves I’m willing to sit
through. However, if I’ve
established multiple targets
and my first target is hit, then



==================================================
                    PAGE 1791                     
==================================================

and only then will I generally
move up my stop to protect
gains on the entire trade. For
pivot plays, I treat stop
movement the same way on
both trending and choppy
days. I’m just waiting for my
first target to get hit. Once
that happens, then and only
then will I move up my stop.

2. If this was a trending
day, then I would
wait until my first
target—the next
pivot level— is hit.
At that point, I
would trail up my
stop. On a choppy
day, my first target
would be +10 points
on the YM, so in

would mean that my
stop would have
been moved up
sooner, right after
my first lower target
was hit.
Tips and Tricks for Using
the Pivots
The key with this setup and
all the setups I use is that the
trader gets everything



==================================================
                    PAGE 1796                     
==================================================

prepared on her charts in
advance of the opening.
Once everything is set up, all
the trader has to do is watch
and wait, or, better yet,
utilize audio alerts to give
her a heads-up that a setup is
either forming or firing off.
With pivots, traders can
place orders in advance, as
the exact targets, entries, and
stops are known before the
trade is entered. This way,
the traders can also focus on



==================================================
                    PAGE 1797                     
==================================================

other things if they come up.
When the traders hear the
alerts going off, they know
that it is time to go back to
their charts and see what is
going on. There is no
chasing. Either the orders
will get hit or they will not.
This system, like all the
systems I use, is constructed
in such a way as to naturally
enforce the mindset of a
professional trader, which is
the only consistent way to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1798                     
==================================================

make money in the financial
markets.
The important thing to
know about midpoints is that
you don’t need to use them
all the time. I use them on
days when the distance
between two YM daily pivot
levels is greater than 40
points. This is a general rule,
and it is okay to use them if
the pivot level is only 30
points. If the pivots are closer



==================================================
                    PAGE 1799                     
==================================================

together than 30 points, the
midpoints don’t play as much
of a role, as the markets will
move straight to the next
pivot, since the pivots are so
close together.
On my charts, I typically
use a black background,
which can’t be shown in the
context of this book. I then
make the daily pivots yellow,
the weekly pivots light blue
(cyan), the monthly pivots



==================================================
                    PAGE 1800                     
==================================================

purple, and the midpoints
white. I also make the central
pivots solid lines and the rest
of the pivots dotted or dashed
lines. This way it is very easy
to pick out what the markets
are butting up against.
The use of pivots has
gotten a lot easier over the
years. I used to calculate
these manually, using a
calculator, but I eventually
switched to an Excel



==================================================
                    PAGE 1801                     
==================================================

spreadsheet where all I had
to do was enter the high, low,
and close, and the
spreadsheet did the rest.
However, I still had to draw
the horizontal lines manually
on my charts each day, and
this took a good part of half
an hour. There is software
that will calculate the pivots
for a person automatically,
but it generally uses the
wrong time frames and can
create errors because of bad



==================================================
                    PAGE 1802                     
==================================================

ticks. I’m anal-retentive
when it comes to this, and I
have to enter my pivots
manually each day—I want
to make sure they are correct.
I finally found a programmer
who could help me out on
this, and the end result is a
piece of software that
automatically calculates the
correct daily, weekly, and
monthly pivot levels and
automatically draws them on
the various charts I watch.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1803                     
==================================================

Manually is fine too, but this
does save time, something
that I have less of now that I
have kids!
What About Fibonacci
Numbers?
One question I frequently
receive with regard to the
pivots is how they relate to
Fibonacci retracement levels.
For the uninitiated, Fibonacci
numbers are used by traders



==================================================
                    PAGE 1804                     
==================================================

to determine support and
resistance levels, with the
most commonly used
retracement levels being
0.382, 0.50, and 0.618. In my
experience, sometimes these
work great, and sometimes
the market doesn’t even
know they exist and blows
right through them.
However, I do like to see
where the Fibonacci cluster
numbers are on any given
trading day. These are more



==================================================
                    PAGE 1805                     
==================================================

accurate than regular
Fibonacci numbers because
of the use of more data points
and the way the Fibonacci
ratios are calculated. Getting
these numbers takes a lot of
work, and for a while I
calculated them myself. Then
I discovered Carolyn
Boroden’s work at
www.fibonacciqueen.com,
and from then on I just
subscribed to her service, as
this is her area of expertise.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1806                     
==================================================

She works on both the time
and price axes of the
markets, using the
confluence of Fibonacci
ratios. For price, she runs
retracements of prior swings
using the ratios 0.382, 0.50,
0.618, and 0.786. She also
runs price extensions of prior
swings, which are essentially
retracements beyond 100
percent. For extensions, she
uses the ratios 1.272 and
1.618. Carolyn also runs



==================================================
                    PAGE 1807                     
==================================================

price projections comparing
swings in the same direction.
For projections, she uses 100
percent and 1.618. In doing
this, she runs all possible
levels from the key swing
highs and lows in a chart and
looks for the confluences.
When she sees a confluence,
these become the key levels
in the markets to buy and sell
against.
Personally, I’m interested



==================================================
                    PAGE 1808                     
==================================================

in the bigger levels found on
60-minute and daily charts,
and I use these mostly for
swing trading. However,
there will be days when these
clusters line up with some of
the daily pivot levels, and of
course on these days those
particular levels become that
much stronger. I also like to
look at these Fibonacci
cluster levels on other
markets, as they provide key
levels across all markets.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1809                     
==================================================

Let’s look at a few examples
from Carolyn Boroden’s
work.
Mini-Sized Dow—June 2005
Contract, April 6, 2005
Figure 8.19 is on the 15-
minute mini-sized Dow
futures contract. You can see
the obvious uptrend that
developed from the April 4
swing low. For this reason,
we wanted to focus on



==================================================
                    PAGE 1810                     
==================================================

setting up clusters on the buy
side of the market. We saw a
nice zone develop between
10,489 and 10,492. This zone
included the coincidence of a
1.618 price extension, a 0.50
percent retracement, a 0.382
retracement of another
swing, and a 100 percent
price projection of a prior
corrective decline. The initial
low was made directly within
this cluster zone at the
10,489 level. From there, we



==================================================
                    PAGE 1811                     
==================================================

saw a rally to 10,578, or 89
points.
Euro FX—June 2005
Contract, April 27, 2005
In the five-minute euro
currency example in Figure
8.20, we found a confluence
of three key Fibonacci price
relationships between 1.2970
and 1.2971. This included a
0.618 retracement of the
1.2961 low to the 1.2988



==================================================
                    PAGE 1812                     
==================================================

high, a 0.786 retracement of
the 1.2966 low to the 1.2988
high, and a 100 percent price
projection of the 1.2984 high
to the 1.2966 (swing) low.
The actual low was made at
1.2972. The initial rally took
you to 1.2990.
Mini-Sized Dow—June 2005
Contract, April 4, 2005
For entries into the market,
we ideally want to set up



==================================================
                    PAGE 1813                     
==================================================

“price clusters” in the
direction of the trend in the
time frame we are trading.
We sometimes use
“countertrend” clusters for
exits or to tighten up stops on
a position. The example in
Figure 8.21 in the mini-sized
Dow futures contract shows a
confluence (clustering) of at
least five Fibonacci price
relationships in the 10,132–
10,141 area. The focus of
these levels came in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1814                     
==================================================

10,132–10,136 area. In this
case, the actual low was
made at 10,140. A “trigger”
for an entry against this zone
could be as simple as taking
out a prior bar high. At that
point, your initial stop could
be placed either below the
low made prior to the trigger
(10,140) or below the low
end of the cluster zone
(10,135). The initial move
off this cluster was 58 points.

Figure 8.21
These examples of
Carolyn’s work show how
these Fibonacci clusters act
as support and resistance
levels in the markets, and I
use them intraday just as I
use the pivot levels. They can
also be used to initiate swing
trades on larger time frames,
as these can be used on any
time frame, from a three-
minute chart to a weekly or

Carolyn also has a great
book out on the subject
entitled Fibonacci Trading:
How to Master the Time and
Price Advantage. It’s
available on Amazon.
What’s the Best Way to

I mentioned at the beginning
of this chapter that I prefer to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1822                     
==================================================

utilize only weekly pivot
levels on the other
commodity charts. This
includes anything other than
stock indexes, and could be
currencies, gold, oil …
literally anything other than
stock indexes. There are two
reasons for this. The first is
that while I don’t mind
trading the stock indexes for
smaller moves, I generally
like to trade the other
commodities for larger



==================================================
                    PAGE 1823                     
==================================================

moves, trades that last a few
hours or more as opposed to
a few minutes. In that
respect, I look at hourly
charts on the rest of the
commodities, and I utilize
the weekly pivots on these
charts so that I can see these
key levels in relation to the
current price action.

Figure 8.22
In Figure 8.22, there is a
chart of the euro currency
futures contract from
September 29, 2011. My
main focus on this chart, as
well as for other hourly
commodity contracts, is the
location of the main central
pivot. On this chart, that is
represented by the 1.3542
price point. Over the course
of this week, the euro has



==================================================
                    PAGE 1826                     
==================================================

been attracted to this level
like a magnet, and this is
typical. This weekly “central
pivot” is a key area for both
initiating positions and
taking profits.
Summing Up the Pivots
The pivot levels work mainly
because of the psychology
pain/pleasure cycle that
perpetuates the markets each
day. Traders who follow only



==================================================
                    PAGE 1827                     
==================================================

indicators will chase a
position when it is already
half to three-quarters of the
way off its pivot, and it is
these traders who provide the
stop losses to perpetuate the
next cycle of market
movement. If you rely only
on indicators for your entries,
instead of using the price
action of the pivots, you will
get in and out of these cycles
too late, and you won’t make
any money trading.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1828                     
==================================================

What is nice about this
system is that traders don’t
have to watch it very closely
once they are in a position.
I’m not an aggressive trailer
of stops. I like to get in a
position, set my parameters,
and then focus on other
things. Depending on a
trader’s work situation, he
could do this at the office,
especially on the West Coast,
and especially if he had an
order system that



==================================================
                    PAGE 1829                     
==================================================

automatically bracketed
trades. This way he can place
the parameters and then go to
the next meeting or
appointment. Let the
parameters babysit the
position. This is much better
as well because it takes
human emotion out of the
equation.
I’ve created a video at
www.tradethemarkets.com/pivots
that gives additional, updated

==================================================

The stock markets spend the
majority of their time
backing and filling. That is,
they drift up to a resistance
level, then turn around and
drift back to a level of
support, not really doing
much of anything. For most
of this time, there isn’t much
for a trader to do except wait,
and that usually requires
extreme patience. Many
traders fail in this regard.
After all, they are traders,

right? They should be taking
a trade or managing a trade,
not just sitting around doing
nothing. This is and will
always be one of the biggest
misconceptions about trading
—the idea that a trader has to
be in a trade nearly every
minute or every hour of the
day. In reality, there are
always three positions traders
can be in at any given time:
they can be long, short, or
flat. For day trading, being



==================================================
                    PAGE 1834                     
==================================================

flat, meaning not having any
trades on, is the best course
of action 60 percent of the
time. Cats don’t chase the
first bird they see. They
crouch and wait, sometimes
for hours, for the right time
to pounce. And that’s what
the active trader should do.
When something interesting
actually does happen, such as
a buy or sell program hitting
the markets, this creates a
great scalping opportunity



==================================================
                    PAGE 1835                     
==================================================

for the alert trader. The key
for traders is to be patient, sit
on their hands, and wait for
these moments to occur.
Actively trading really means
actively waiting. Overtrading
is the number one reason
most day traders fail.
There is no easier way to
do this than by watching the
$TICK, or, I should say,
“listening” for the $TICK.
When the $TICK gets over



==================================================
                    PAGE 1836                     
==================================================

+1,000 or under –1,000, this
represents extreme buying or
selling, and at this stage of
the move, most of the bullets
have already been fired.
Many amateur traders get
caught up in the froth and
excitement, get scared that
they are missing out on a big
move, and jump onboard in
the direction of the move—
just as it is starting to peter
out. These are the bag
holders that will get shaken



==================================================
                    PAGE 1837                     
==================================================

out on the reversal. Rather
than join the move, I like to
wait until an extreme tick
reading is registered and then
fade the move. Earlier I
mentioned that I liked to
listen for the $TICK. By this
I mean that I have set up
audio signals to alert me
when these levels are hit.
This way, I don’t have to
stare at the charts and
potentially miss a move
because I’m not paying



==================================================
                    PAGE 1838                     
==================================================

attention. I can be down the
hall, but if I hear the alert, I
know exactly what is going
on.
Getting down to specifics,
whenever I see or hear
readings of over +1,000 or –
1,000 $TICK, I fade the
move by placing a market
order. If we get a +1,000 tick
reading and I am flat, I short
the move at current levels. If
I am already long based on



==================================================
                    PAGE 1839                     
==================================================

another signal, I start exiting
that move and initiating a
short position. The reverse is
also true. If the markets are
selling off and traders are
jumping in on the move
down to the point where a
tick reading of –1,000 is
registered, I want to step in
and buy. There isn’t any
cleaner way to get on the
opposite side of amateur
traders who are chasing the
market. I’ve been shown a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1840                     
==================================================

couple of different renditions
of this setup by other traders.
The $TICK has been around
for a long time, and many
people who have been doing
this for decades have a
portion of their trading tied
into the $TICK movement.
In this chapter, I’m going
to first cover the fading
strategies. Toward the end of
this chapter is new
information on how and

when to “go with” extreme
tick readings, meaning that
when a +1,000 reading is hit,
how to know when to wait
for a pullback to the 0.00 line
to actually buy and “go with”
that extreme $TICK reading.
Note that I use the terms
$TICK, tick, and ticks
interchangeably, and they all
mean the same thing. When
I’m trading, I’ll tell someone,
“The ticks are high here.” I
don’t say, “The dollar sign

==================================================

tick is high here.”
What Are the Trading
Rules for Sell Fades (Buys
Are Reversed)?
1. I have studied three
different setups that
I have learned from
other traders and
have modified to fit
my own trading
plan and style. Let’s
look at the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1843                     
==================================================

parameters I use for
this “extreme
emotion” play. I
take trades only
between 10:00 a.m.
and 3:30 p.m.
eastern. A lot of
sporadic action can
happen during the
first and last half-
hour of trading. I
like to let the
markets settle in
before I take trades.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1844                     
==================================================

2. I play tick fades in
two markets, the E-
mini S&Ps (ES) and
the mini-sized Dow
(YM). These can
also be played in the
SPY, DIA, E-mini
Russell, E-mini
Nasdaq, and any
stocks that are
mirroring the action
of these indexes.
For option traders, it
is perfectly okay to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1845                     
==================================================

use options on the
SPY to do this
trade. Of course,
you should choose
slightly in-the-
money options
when doing this. My
preference, of
course, is options
with a delta of at
least 0.70.
3. When the ticks reach
+1,000, I short at



==================================================
                    PAGE 1846                     
==================================================

the market. I like to
set audio alerts for
+1,000 and –1,000
readings. That way,
I don’t have to stare
at the chart. If the
ticks get to +988
and fall back, I
don’t take the trade
because I won’t hear
my audio alert. This
keeps the setup
clean and very
specific, and not



==================================================
                    PAGE 1847                     
==================================================

subject to trader
interpretation.
4. For the YM, I use a
30-point stop and a
20-point target. I
also set a time limit
of 35 minutes on
this trade. If my
stop or target isn’t
hit within the 35-
minute time span,
then I exit my
position at the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1848                     
==================================================

market. I like to use
a timer with a beep
so that I’m aware of
when the 35-minute
time limit has
passed. Most traders
have very little
sense of time when
they’re in a trade.
5. For the ES, I use a 3-
point stop and a 2-
point target, as well
as the same time



==================================================
                    PAGE 1849                     
==================================================

limit.
6. If I am stopped out
twice in a row on
this trade, I am done
with tick fades for
the day. By
“stopped out,” I
mean that my
physical hard stop is
hit, as opposed to
the time stop. Note
that it is on these
days that I will



==================================================
                    PAGE 1850                     
==================================================

switch to a “go
with” strategy,
which I will talk
about later in this
chapter.
7. If by 12:00 noon
eastern the ticks
have spent more
than 85 percent of
their time above
zero, I will pass on
all other tick fade
plays for the day.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1851                     
==================================================

This shows an
extreme level of
buying in the
market, indicating
that funds are
accumulating
stocks. These
“power days” are
rare, but they do
happen about once
every four to six
weeks. They are
accompanied by
many extreme tick



==================================================
                    PAGE 1852                     
==================================================

readings above
1,000, typically
between 1,200 and
1,400 ticks. In
addition, if it is past
10:00 a.m. eastern
and the ticks have
all been one-sided,
for example, all
positive on the day,
I will wait until the
ticks have spent
some time in
negative territory



==================================================
                    PAGE 1853                     
==================================================

before setting up the
first tick fade play.
On these days, this
is a sign to “go
with” the ticks.

exit at the market.
I’m out at 10,252

points.
5. The ticks head north
of +1,000 in the
middle of the day.
The only reason I’m
aware of this is that

                    PAGE 1865

my audio alert goes

was on the phone. I
drop it and run over
to the computer,
short at the market,

parameters, set my
timer, and go back
to my phone call.
6. I hear my timer go

come back to my
computer and see
that I am still in the
trade (that is, neither
my stop nor my
target has been hit),
and I exit at the
market. I get out at
10,255 for +9
points. I don’t try to
finesse these timer
exits—I just get out.

at the market. I’m in

I’m filled at

1. On September 3,
2004, the pickings
are slim. The ticks
get close to +1,000
and close to –1,000,
but they never
actually hit these
levels (see Figure
9.7). I don’t mess
around with these
kinds of plays.
Either the ticks hit

                    PAGE 1897                     
==================================================

1,000 or they don’t.
We don’t get an
extreme reading on
this day until the
final hour, when the
markets register a
+1,000 reading. I
leap at this
opportunity to do
something, and I
short at the market. I
am filled at
1117.25. I set my
stop and my target,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1898                     
==================================================

and I turn on my
timer. I kick back
and watch the
action.

after my entry, my

Conveniently, the

and I can now do

exciting, such as

cans in the pantry

is a good example
of why it is so
important to have a
specific setup to
wait for. Without
one, a trader can
spend a day like
September 3
overtrading and
chopping himself

times to take a trade
just to alleviate the
boredom. But this
begs the question—
is the goal of trading
“not to be bored” or
to make money?

an extreme reading
early in the day, but
they don’t quite get
there, registering a
high of +978 (see
Figure 9.8). Since
this is not a game of

aside and wait until
we get an actual
reading of over
+1,000.

2. Again, we come
close to 1,000 ticks,
but we don’t quite
cut the mustard. I
stand aside and do
nothing. This
actually isn’t as hard
as it may seem. I
don’t stare at the
tick chart; I’m
taking action only if

3. Finally, we get a
reading of over
+1,000. I short at
the market, and I’m
filled at 1106.75. I
set my parameters
and await the action
—having done
nothing all day at
this point with
regard to this setup.

the day is quiet, but
as we approach the

this signal for the
same reason. The
markets are “on
fire” today, as is
evidenced by the
consistent high tick
readings, with
hardly anything
dipping below the
zero level. I
therefore pass on
fading these

                    PAGE 1923                     
==================================================

readings. Although
these days are rare,
it is important to
know what they
look like so that
they can be avoided
in terms of a “tick
fade” day.
Summing Up the Tick
Fades
As I state in the introduction,
the financial markets are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1924                     
==================================================

naturally set up to take
advantage of and prey upon
human nature. When traders
see a market running away
without them, their natural
instinct is to jump onboard
and participate in the run.
Although this makes sense
on paper, this feeling of
“missing the move” causes
more trading errors than
almost anything else. This
blinding urge forces amateur
traders to jump into markets



==================================================
                    PAGE 1925                     
==================================================

based solely on the fear that
they are missing out on a lot
of profits—as opposed to
entering the market as a
result of a specific setup that
they have mapped out and
are patiently waiting to set
up. This extreme panic
buying and selling is
measured accurately by the
ticks, and extreme tick
readings provide traders with
the opportunity to jump into
the markets and teach the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1926                     
==================================================

amateurs a valuable lesson.
How Do You Know When
Fading Ticks Won’t Work?
In the first edition of this
book, I focused exclusively
on the “fade” setup. During
most of 2004 and 2005
(when I wrote the first
edition), the stock indexes
were extremely quiet, and
most of the big momentum
moves were found in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1927                     
==================================================

currency markets. And that’s
one great thing about
becoming a trader of setups
—the market you end up
trading is irrelevant. In truth,
I don’t trade markets; I trade
setups and patterns. I
couldn’t care less whether a
setup takes place in the stock
market, oil, or gold. Just give
me something that is ready to
make a move.
Since the 2008 financial



==================================================
                    PAGE 1928                     
==================================================

crisis, however, big stock
market moves have become
the new normal—big moves
to the upside and big moves
to the downside. Either is
fine with me, and the ticks
play a crucial role in these
types of markets as well. The
bottom line is this: if the
markets are crashing today,
then we aren’t going to try to
buy a –1,000 tick reading.
We are, in fact, going to use
modest tick strength (instead



==================================================
                    PAGE 1929                     
==================================================

of extreme tick strength) as
an opportunity to go short.
The question comes down
to this: how do we know
whether we should be fading
the move or going with the
move? And, if we are going
to go with the move, how do
we play that move?
Let’s jump in and take a
look.
How Do We Trade “Going
with” the Ticks Instead of

Fading Them?
This chapter ties in a lot with
the chapter on internals. The
first half hour of trading is
typically very telling
concerning what kind of day
it’s going to be. It’s like
when I wake up in the
morning and try to gauge my
wife’s mood. I’ve learned
that if she’s had dreams of
happy things and happy
places, then the day will start



==================================================
                    PAGE 1931                     
==================================================

off positive and trend that
way well into the evening. If,
on the other hand, she had a
dream about me and our
Swedish au pair, then I know
the first half hour of the day
is going to be dicey at best,
and the rest of the day will
depend on how I navigate
that early session. During
those shaky times, I try to
reassure her that I’m a trader
at heart, and that swapping
out half my net worth for a



==================================================
                    PAGE 1932                     
==================================================

quickie with the au pair is, at
best, a bad trade. Sometimes
that logic seems to help.
Sometimes.
Quite simply, the ticks are
a road map to what the
elephants are doing and
where they are going. In July
2010, I traveled to South
Africa for two weeks to see
the World Cup. It was an
amazing trip. The first week I
stayed at Ulusaba, which is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1933                     
==================================================

Richard Branson’s game
reserve, located in Kruger
National Park. Although the
terrain looked a lot like
Texas, it was amazing to see
the “Big 5” in their natural
habitat, up close and
personal. Of the Big 5
animals, the easiest to find
were the elephants. Not only
could you see their tracks,
but you couldn’t help seeing
the knocked-over trees and
their huge piles of dung. For



==================================================
                    PAGE 1934                     
==================================================

them, hiding was impossible.
(As opposed to the jaguar,
which was extremely
difficult to find. In trading,
just be the jaguar quietly
following the elephant.)
Large-scale coordinated
institutional buying and
selling is the same. It is
impossible for them to hide if
you know where to look. The
$TICK marks their trail
through the bush, along with



==================================================
                    PAGE 1935                     
==================================================

their steaming piles of dung.
As traders, all we have to do
is follow along for the ride.
In Figure 9.11, we have a
snapshot of the $TICK and
SPY from Friday, September
30, 2011. On this particular
day, the first few hours of
trading are on the quiet side.
The market gaps down big,
about 15 ES points (150 Dow
points), which is $1.50 on the
SPY. It takes time for traders



==================================================
                    PAGE 1936                     
==================================================

to digest this move, and the
first few hours see choppy
action. The first extreme
$TICK reading occurs at
11:20 a.m. eastern, when the
ticks hit the +1,000 level.
The first extreme $TICK
reading of the day is a good
one to fade. It’s the first
probe, and probes generally
fail. In this case, the markets
chop around for about 20
minutes and then promptly
sell off.



==================================================

==================================================

Figure 9.11
The $TICK goes back into
quiet mode, and then about
an hour later we get the first
extreme $TICK reading to
the downside. At this point,
even though the market has
gapped down more than 15
ES points, it is still choppy.
There isn’t any real trend in
place. This might seem like a
scary $TICK reading to buy
because the market is down



==================================================
                    PAGE 1939                     
==================================================

so much, but in reality it’s
the first real probe to the
downside during the cash
session (the rest of the selling
occurred during the
overnight session). It’s worth
a shot. After the extreme
$TICK reading, the market
did indeed set up a nice rally,
so fading the first extreme
$TICK reading of the day is
working nicely.
At point 3, the dynamics



==================================================
                    PAGE 1940                     
==================================================

change. First and foremost,
the market is no longer
choppy. It’s making new
lows on the day. That’s not
chop; that’s trend. It is after
this point, however, that
things get interesting. Try as
they might, the ticks cannot
push much above the +200
level, and when they do, they
are rejected handily. Not
only are they now spending
most of their time below
zero, but they continue to



==================================================
                    PAGE 1941                     
==================================================

probe the –1,000 level and
beyond. And that’s the real
key here. If a market tests –
1,000 and bounces back,
that’s a probe. If, on the other
hand, a market tests –1,000
and then keeps hanging
around at that level, even
testing lower $TICK levels,
then there is some real
selling coming into the
markets. The final stake in
the coffin here is when any
move back toward the 0.00



==================================================
                    PAGE 1942                     
==================================================

line is quickly rejected. Then
we know that the elephants
are selling, and they are
selling hard.
In situations of this type,
there are two strategies. First,
any move to the 0.00 line is a
shorting opportunity. The
stop loss is a market that
stays above +600 for more
than a minute or 4 to 6 ES
points, whichever comes
first. The target is another



==================================================
                    PAGE 1943                     
==================================================

move to –1,000. Into this
ferocious selling, it’s okay to
cover your short, and then
reload at the next retracement
$TICK move to the 0.00 line.
Let’s look at an extreme
example. Sometimes, as in
all areas of life, it helps to
look at an extreme situation
in order to get a better
reading on how to handle
something that’s “normal.”
In Figure 9.12, we see the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1944                     
==================================================

$TICK and how it behaved
on the day of the infamous
“flash crash,” May 6, 2010.
This is a one-minute chart,
on which I’ve placed an
eight-period exponential
moving average (EMA). The
moving average is helpful for
watching the “trend of the
$TICK” intraday. As I’ve
mentioned already, moving
averages are a lagging
indicator, and they aren’t
useful for spotting



==================================================
                    PAGE 1945                     
==================================================

“immediate” changes in
trend. However, they are
useful for clarifying that a
trend “has now changed.”
Many traders blow out their
accounts trying to prove they
are right. Moving averages
are glaring road signs that
indicate when it’s time to
throw in the towel and
change tactics. Still shorting
when the moving averages
have crossed and turned
higher? Good luck with that.

==================================================

Figure 9.12
This day starts out
normally enough. We can see
that at point 1, we get the
first extreme $TICK reading
of the day at –1,000. This is a
normal reading. At point 2,
we start to get consistently
extreme readings, which is
the first heads-up that this is
going to be a “go with” day.
At this point, however, there
is nothing telling us what is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1948                     
==================================================

about to unfold. At point 3,
we get the first –1,500
$TICK reading of the day.
This is unusual and shows
that there is extreme
downside pressure in this
market. At this point, we are
looking at all rallies in the
$TICK as an opportunity to
get short.
For a few hours, the
market then goes into chop
mode. Rallies to the 0.00 line



==================================================
                    PAGE 1949                     
==================================================

(point 4) can be shorted and
then covered when the
$TICK heads down to –
1,000. Easy enough?
And then something very
unusual happens. At point 5,
we start to get consistent
readings at the –1,500 level,
which shows an incredible
amount of selling pressure.
This is a rare reading, and it
shows that there is some
“ugliness” going on out there



==================================================
                    PAGE 1950                     
==================================================

and that this day might, in
fact, be a “crash day.”
Crashes can occur only when
there are consistent $TICK
readings in the –1,200 to –
1,500 range. If the $TICK
hangs out at these levels, the
selling eventually cracks the
markets. And then things get
even more intense at point 6,
when the $TICK hits –1,875
and in fact tests the –1,700 to
–1,800 level multiple times.
The markets start selling off



==================================================
                    PAGE 1951                     
==================================================

steadily for about 15
minutes, to the point where
the Dow is down just over
300 points. And then all hell
breaks loose, and the Dow
drops another 600 points
over the course of five
minutes … only to then
recover that move in the next
five minutes. “The world is
coming to an end,” I hear a
few people say. “Never
mind, it’s not.”

==================================================

Was there any way to tell
that the “flash crash” was
going to happen this day? Of
course not. Were there
telltale signs that intense
selling pressure was hitting
this market, and that there
wasn’t any reason to be
long? Yes, absolutely.
Finally, was there a way to
recognize that the selling
pressure had come to an end?
Yes.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1953                     
==================================================

At point 7, we can see that
the downward trendline of
the eight-period moving
average has been broken.
Moments like this represent
key areas of “mentality shift”
in the herd of elephants that
we are trying to follow. For a
while, they were heading
south, and we followed them
south. Now they’ve changed
direction and are headed
north, and there is nothing to
do but follow them north.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1954                     
==================================================

This doesn’t mean that we
are able to catch the dead
bottom of a move; it just
means that once we are able
to see that the herd has
shifted, we can then also shift
our focus. Once the $TICK
shifted, it became time to
focus on long setups,
although every ounce of
rational thought fought
against that idea.
In Figure 9.13, I’ve



==================================================
                    PAGE 1955                     
==================================================

zoomed in on the flash crash
portion of the day. Points 1
and 2 show the extreme –
1,500 $TICK readings and
the even more extreme –
1,800 $TICK readings. These
are very hard for the market
to “shake off.” They indicate
persistent selling, with more
to come. Anytime I see
something like this, I expect
any rallies to continue to be
sold and for new lows to
continue to be made on the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1956                     
==================================================

day. The underlying intensity
of this type of selling cannot
be underestimated.
Shortly after point 2, the
eight-period EMA turns
higher and a small bounce
ensues. However, remember
from the previous chart that
what we are looking for here
is a change in trend. That
doesn’t happen until point 3,
when we break the trendline
shown in Figure 9.12 at point

the flow and not fighting the
action unfolding on the
computer screen.

Figure 9.13
With Figure 9.14, we have
slightly more “normal”
conditions. This is from
Monday, October 3, 2011.
The market shows some
choppy strength early in the
session, then rolls over into
steady selling. One thing I’ve
found helpful in “watching
the flow of the $TICK” is to
place an 8- and 21-period
EMA on the one-minute



==================================================
                    PAGE 1960                     
==================================================

chart. On this chart, the 8-
period EMA is the thick line,
and the 21-period EMA is
the thin line. Although I
spend more time watching
the actual $TICK, these
moving averages are helpful
in gauging the “trend of the
$TICK,” which drives the
price action throughout the
day. If I see these moving
averages above the zero line,
then I’m inclined to focus on
the long side, and if they are



==================================================
                    PAGE 1961                     
==================================================

below the zero line, then I’m
going to focus more on the
short side. The crosses on
these moving averages are
also helpful. If the ticks are
below zero, a cross of the 8-
period EMA below the 21-
period EMA indicates
massive selling pressure. A
cross of the 8-period EMA
above the 21-period EMA
(while below zero) indicates
a pause in the selling
pressure, and the reverse is



==================================================
                    PAGE 1962                     
==================================================

also true when the ticks are
above zero.

Figure 9.15
On this chart, the $TICK
rallies and the SPY rallies
into point 2, only to be
rejected, forming an intraday
swing high, a key level that
will need to get broken for
there to be a significant
short-covering rally into the
close. At point 3, the $TICK
goes positive and the markets
rally hard, only to get



==================================================
                    PAGE 1967                     
==================================================

rejected again. Finally, at
point 4, a time of day when a
reversal is most likely to
happen, the $TICK rallies
above zero and the SPY
rallies hard, only to get
handily rejected at this level
once again. This time the
markets plummet into the
close. What do all of these
key rallies have in common?
Although the $TICK went
positive and a market rally
looked promising, the 8- and



==================================================
                    PAGE 1968                     
==================================================

21-period EMAs could not
both cross above zero. As
long as they are staying
below zero, the pressure is to
the downside.
In quiet markets, fading
$TICK moves and the
occasional wayward high
$TICK reading is a solid way
to make a living. Watch it,
though, when the elephants
are moving. During those
times, it’s best to follow the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1969                     
==================================================

herd.
I can’t imagine day
trading stocks or stock
indexes without using the
information provided by the
$TICK indicator. The best
way to learn about how to
use this indicator is simply to
start using it. I’ve logged
over 20,000 hours watching
how the $TICK interacts
with the market. I’ve created
a page at

this setup as well as live
trading examples. Watching
this with live examples is
really the only way to learn
how to maximize this trading
asset.

The pivots are great for
establishing ranges in
markets on an intraday basis.
But what about for larger
time frames, such as daily
and weekly charts? Is there a
way to establish extension
levels to buy and sell against
on a swing basis—positions
that can be held for days or
weeks instead of minutes or
hours? Although this chapter
has nothing to do with pivots,
the general idea is the same.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1973                     
==================================================

A daily pivot level represents
an “average price” from the
prior day’s trading, which is
one of the reasons price is
attracted to that level on the
next trading day. It just needs
to test it out and see if it will
hold.
The concept of average
price is an important one.
Any particular market at any
given time is either
expanding away from its



==================================================
                    PAGE 1974                     
==================================================

average price or reverting
back to its average price—
also known as “reverting to
the mean.”
In Figure 10.1, we see a
daily chart of gold with a set
of exponential moving
averages, the 13-period EMA
and the 21-period EMA.
These levels, which represent
the average prices over the
past 13 days and 21 days,
respectively, are also a

                    PAGE 1975                     
==================================================

continually adapting
representation of a market’s
key average price levels.
These are the specific levels
that the market is either
expanding away from or
reverting back to. The key
question is, then, “How far
away from its average price
zone does a market need to
get before it needs to start
reverting back to that level?”
That’s a great question.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1976                     
==================================================

This is where the concept
of average true range comes
into play. The average true
range, referred to as ATR
throughout the rest of this
chapter, literally represents
the average price range of the
prior 14 periods of trading.



==================================================

Figure 10.1
In Figure 10.2, we see the
same gold chart with its ATR
inserted at the bottom of the
chart. At point 1, the ATR is
around 20, which in this case
means $20.00 an ounce on
the price of gold. Why is this
important? It means that
most of the time, if the price
action moves about $20.00
away from the mean (the
zone represented by the 13-



==================================================
                    PAGE 1979                     
==================================================

and 21-period EMAs), then
it’s going to have to start
reverting back to the mean.
At point 1, prices extended
above these moving averages
by $20.00 an ounce, and then
started making their way
back. At point 2, prices
extended about $20.00 an
ounce below these levels,
and then promptly made their
way back to the mean. Later
in the year, we can see that
the ATR increases to $60.00



==================================================
                    PAGE 1980                     
==================================================

an ounce, at point 3, which
means that the price action
could move this far away
before it needed to start
working its way back.

==================================================

Figure 10.2
In Figure 10.3, we have a
daily chart of the Swiss franc
(SF). On this chart, I’ve
placed a modified version of
the Keltner Channels, which
plot the average true range as
outer-range bands. I have the
“mean” price (the middle
dotted band) set to 13, and I
set the bands to be 1.5 times
that average true range. This
means that at any given time,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1983                     
==================================================

both the upper and lower
bands will be 1.5 times the
current ATR reading away
from the middle band. For
example, at point 1, we have
an ATR reading of 0.0100,
which translates into 100
ticks. Multiply this by 1.5,
and you get 150 ticks. At
point 2, we see that the lower
band is 150 ticks away from
the middle band, and at point
3, the upper band is also 150
ticks away from the middle



==================================================
                    PAGE 1984                     
==================================================

band. Why multiply it by
1.5? The ATR is a lagging
indicator, and by multiplying
it by 1.5, we give a little
more room to accommodate
the most current price action.



==================================================
                    PAGE 1985

                    PAGE 1986                     
==================================================

Figure 10.3
There are now a couple of
key concepts we need to
understand in order to trade
this setup on this chart.
1. The bands are
sloping upward,
indicating, surprise,
an uptrend. Because
of this, I’m
interested in
initiating only long



==================================================
                    PAGE 1987                     
==================================================

trades. I could
initiate short trades
at the upper bands,
but since the upper
bands are
continually rising,
this is an inherently
lower-probability
strategy than going
long. For example,
if we initiated a
short at point A, the
market would just
keep moving higher



==================================================
                    PAGE 1988                     
==================================================

and stop us out. The
market is still
trading within its
ATR, just on a steep
uprising slope.
2. At point 4, we get a
pullback to the
mean. I initiate a
long. When SF
moves back to the
outer band at point
5, I close out the
position. Then when



==================================================
                    PAGE 1989                     
==================================================

SF pulls back to the
mean again at point
6, I go long, and I
sell at point 7. I then
buy the pullback at
point 8 and close it
out at point 9.
Wash, rinse, repeat.
3. Tip: there is no need
to try to capture
every tick of these
moves. Remember
that I said that the



==================================================
                    PAGE 1990                     
==================================================

bands were set to
1.5 times the ATR?
Well, I’m really
interested in
capturing only 1
ATR worth of
movement, or even
slightly less than
that. So I’m getting
out of the trade at
point 7, even though
it hasn’t hit the
band. This is
because I’m trying



==================================================
                    PAGE 1991                     
==================================================

to get only 1 ATR
(about 100 ticks)
instead of 1.5 ATR
(about 150 ticks). In
other words, I’m
constantly selling
too soon. There’s no
need to be a pig at
the trough.
4. What about stops?
For best results,
have stop losses, in
this case, just



==================================================
                    PAGE 1992                     
==================================================

outside the lower
bands. This keeps a
trader completely
out of the wiggle
room, and a stop out
usually occurs only
when there’s a
change in trend.
This is one of those
setups where stops
that are too tight
will have a bad
impact. Trade
smaller size and let



==================================================
                    PAGE 1993                     
==================================================

the trade work itself
out.
5. Bonus: if the move
gets too near the
lower band,
indicating a
potential change in
trend, as happened
at point B, the trader
has the option of
bailing out on the
trade on a move
back to the mean,



==================================================
                    PAGE 1994                     
==================================================

closing out the trade
at a “scratch” or
small loss. Double
bonus: A trader can
also start out with
half size, double up
to full size on a
move toward the
lower band, then get
out on a move back
to the mean for a
profit. This is one of
my favorite ways to
turn losing trades



==================================================
                    PAGE 1995                     
==================================================

into small winners.
The key, of course,
is money
management and
fully understanding
what a full-sized
position means for
your account. It
does not mean
“doubling up” to
position sizes that
are too large for
your account. It is
critical to still keep



==================================================
                    PAGE 1996                     
==================================================

a hard stop in place
during these types
of trades.
6. Another tip: one of
the most common
questions I get is
something along the
lines of, “What kind
of stop would you
use on the Swiss
franc on the hourly
chart?” or, “What
kind of stop would



==================================================
                    PAGE 1997                     
==================================================

you use on Amazon
on a daily chart?” or
even, “What kind of
stop would you use
on crude oil on a
512-tick chart?” or,
perhaps, something
like, “What kind of
stop would you use
on the ES on a 15-
minute chart?” or,
quite possibly,
something along the
lines of, “What kind



==================================================
                    PAGE 1998                     
==================================================

of stop would you
use on the euro on a
five-minute chart?”
(After about the
10th time in a
matter of minutes, I
start to get a
nervous tick in my
left eye.) Here’s the
answer: no matter
what market you are
looking at and no
matter what your
time frame, you can



==================================================
                    PAGE 1999                     
==================================================

put a 14-period
average true range
indicator on your
chart. Whatever that
value is, double it,
and you have your
stop. Voilà!
7. Also note that at
point A, the market
just runs away, and
during a move like
this, it’s typical not
to get filled on a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2000                     
==================================================

reversion to the
mean for days,
sometimes weeks at
a time. This setup is
geared to catch bits
and pieces of a
market that is in a
quiet trend or
quietly trading
sideways. It’s not
meant to capture
momentum.
8. Key point: the one



==================================================
                    PAGE 2001                     
==================================================

major flaw with this
setup is that it can
miss entire big
moves, as big
moves will push
beyond the ATR
bands. This is where
the squeeze comes
into play, which we
will look at next.
This Sounds Awesome—
Why Isn’t Everybody Doing
This?



==================================================
                    PAGE 2002                     
==================================================

Okay, at this point, you are
probably thinking, “If it’s
that easy, why isn’t
everybody doing this setup?”
Alas, a lot of people have
tried. The concept of
reversion to the mean is not
original by any stretch of the
imagination. There are two
things that I’ve seen that
throw traders for a loop on
this setup. The first is the
temptation, in referring to the
same SF chart, for traders to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2003                     
==================================================

short moves to the upper
band in a clearly defined
uptrend. Yes, it will work at
times, but it’s inherently
dangerous, as we saw at
point A. Just go with the
trend, don’t fight it. This also
holds true for downtrending
markets—there is little need
to pursue a strategy of
buying the lower bands when
you can just short
retracements back to the
mean. That’s rule 1.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2004                     
==================================================

(Advanced traders with large
accounts and a scale in
methodology can pull this off
— shorting uptrends to the
upper bands and buying
downtrends to the lower
bands. Newer traders with
smaller accounts get chewed
up and spit out trying to do
this. However, using options,
vertical credit spreads can
safely be initiated at these
levels, which I’ll discuss
shortly.) The second rule is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2005                     
==================================================

that this trade becomes
irrelevant once a squeeze
fires off.
Figure 10.4 shows the SF
daily chart with a squeeze at
the bottom of the chart. I’ll
explain the squeeze setup and
mechanics in more detail in
the next chapter. For now,
here’s the short version. The
darker-colored dots at point 1
indicate a tight compression
of volatility that is about to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2006                     
==================================================

be released. This
compression lasts, in this
case, for 13 bars. The first
lighter-colored dot after the
series of darker dots (as
indicated at point 2) signifies
that this energy is ready to be
released. At this point in
time, a trade is triggered. If
the histogram is above zero
at this time (as it is here), it
indicates a long trade. If the
histogram had been below
zero, then it would have



==================================================
                    PAGE 2007                     
==================================================

Figure 10.4
This squeeze is valid as
long as the histogram
continues moving higher.
When the histogram finally
loses momentum (as
indicated by the darker-
colored bars) the squeeze is
no longer “in play.”
There are a few key things
to know about the squeeze in
relation to the reversion to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2010                     
==================================================

the mean trades, as well as
some general tips on how I
utilize this setup.
1. I typically focus on
reversion to the
mean (RTM) plays
on daily charts only.
I don’t use them on
intraday charts. I
will sometimes
utilize weekly charts
for longer-term
plays.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2011                     
==================================================

2. I look at various
commodities,
including stock
index futures, and
also individual
stocks with this
setup. For
individual stocks,
I’m utilizing these
RTM setups to do
option strategies,
such as buying delta
0.70 options to
capture the move



==================================================
                    PAGE 2012                     
==================================================

back to the upper
band (in the case of
an uptrending
stock).
3. The RTM trade is
valid all the time …
except when a
squeeze has fired
off.
4. Once a squeeze fires
off, disregard the
bands completely.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2013                     
==================================================

They are now
utterly worthless.
The bands will not
hold prices in check
when a squeeze has
fired off. In fact,
once a squeeze has
fired off (that’s what
I call the first
lighter-colored dot,
such as point 2 in
Figure 10.4), I just
take the bands off
the chart. Once the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2014                     
==================================================

squeeze is over, I’ll
put the bands back
on the chart.
5. For the squeeze, I’ll enter a
trade for a directional
momentum play. Here’s
where it gets interesting.
6. A squeeze actually
expands the average
true range of a
market. This is why
doing reversion to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2015                     
==================================================

the mean trades
during a squeeze is
an exercise in
futility. Imagine all
the people out there
trying to do these
trades that don’t
know about or
understand the
squeeze. This trade
works out great for
them 70 percent of
the time, but then
they give back all



==================================================
                    PAGE 2016                     
==================================================

their profits and
then some the
remaining 30
percent of the time.
This is typically
when a squeeze is in
play and they have
no idea about the
concept.
7. For a squeeze, I
generally like to
scale out based on
the concept of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2017                     
==================================================

expanding average
true range levels.
For example, if and
when the trade is up
1 average true range
(in the case of the
Swiss franc, 120
ticks), I’ll take off a
quarter of the
position. Then I’m
looking to see if we
can move to 2 ATR,
or 240 ticks. If we
get there, I’ll take



==================================================
                    PAGE 2018                     
==================================================

off another quarter
and tighten my stop
to my entry. Then if
we get to 3 ATR,
I’ll take off another
quarter. For the last
piece, I’ll hold on
until the momentum
rolls over, as
indicated by point 3
in Figure 10.4. Of
course, if the
squeeze loses
momentum at any



==================================================
                    PAGE 2019                     
==================================================

time during the
trade, it means that
the squeeze is over
and it’s time to bail
on the position,
even if the first
ATR target hasn’t
been hit yet.
In Figure 10.5, we have a
daily chart of AMZN with
the RTM bands and the
squeeze. At points 1 and 2, a
squeeze fires off long.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2020                     
==================================================

During this time, I buy in-
the-money calls (delta of
0.70 or better) on AMZN,
and my plan is to scale out of
the first part as we hit the
various ATR levels, and then
hang on to a chunk of it for
the entire ride, which in the
case of the first squeeze is
considerable. This is the type
of move where an option can
go up 500 percent or more.
AMZN moves steadily
higher from $125.00 a share



==================================================
                    PAGE 2021                     
==================================================

to $160.00 a share in about
one month. Note: with option
plays on daily squeezes, plan
on being in the trade for one
to three weeks. Therefore, if
you are one week out from
expiration, go ahead and buy
the options on the next
month out. Of course, during
this squeeze, the RTM bands
are to be completely ignored
until the squeeze loses
momentum, as indicated by
the two darker-colored



==================================================
                    PAGE 2022                     
==================================================

momentum bars. Once this
takes place, the squeeze is
officially over, and we can
go back to RTM trading. We
did get another squeeze at
point 2. This resulted in a
nice pop in the stock, but the
move was short-lived.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2023

==================================================

Figure 10.5
For the reversion to the
mean trades, there are
examples at points 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 7. The distance between
the middle band and the
upper band is about $6.00. In
these cases, I’m buying in-
the-money calls on pullbacks
to the band, then closing
them out when AMZN
moves up about $4.50.
Remember, the bands are 1.5



==================================================
                    PAGE 2025                     
==================================================

times the ATR, and I’m
interested in capturing only 1
ATR. With a delta 0.70
option, this means that I’m
capturing $3.15 in the option.
A typical scenario here
would be buying a call
option at $9.00 and then
selling it a few days later for
$12.15. One thing that is nice
about RTM trades that go
with the trend is that they are
typically quick. This is great
for option trading, as we



==================================================
                    PAGE 2026                     
==================================================

already know how fast the
clock is ticking on the
premium decay from reading
Chapter 5.
At point 5, this trade gets
stopped out. I bought the
calls on the pullback to the
mean, then the stock
plummeted. Of course, a few
days later it was back to its
upper band again. This is
why they call it “trading” and
not “how to know exactly



==================================================
                    PAGE 2027                     
==================================================

what’s going to happen next
in the markets.”
We’ve looked at plenty of
uptrending examples, so let’s
look at a downtrending
example. Figure 10.6 is a
daily chart of GS (Goldman
Sachs), which on principle is
a stock that I will only short.
Now that we are familiar
with this setup, I’ll start
moving more quickly. At
points 1, 2, 3, and 4, I’m able



==================================================
                    PAGE 2028                     
==================================================

to buy in-the-money puts
(yep, delta of 0.70) and close
them out on a move back to
the lower band. Trade 4 took
nine days to hit its target,
while the other trades all hit
their targets in one to three
days. At point 5, a squeeze
fired off short, and it turned
out to be a very quiet trade,
in essence a normal reversion
to the mean trade. That
happens sometimes with a
squeeze. Not every squeeze



==================================================
                    PAGE 2029                     
==================================================

trade is a big trade, but a lot
of big trades are the result of
a squeeze. At point 6, I
initiate another RTM trade,
as the squeeze has lost
momentum.
I will use this setup on
just about anything, although
to reiterate, I do not follow it
on intraday time frames. The
daily chart is my first choice,
although I will also check the
weekly chart for longer-term



==================================================
                    PAGE 2030                     
==================================================

plays. Are there other ways
to utilize this setup with
options? Absolutely.
Figure 10.7 is a screen
shot of AMZN on a daily
chart, rallying right into its
upper band on October 12,
2011, as it hit a high of
$241.84. On October 11, via
our
www.SimplerOptions.com
options trading alert service,
we placed an order to sell a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2031                     
==================================================

vertical credit spread at $2.30
on the weekly options, which
was the price that this spread
would hit should AMZN
actually rally into that level.
It did rally, and we got filled.
For those who aren’t sure
what “selling a vertical credit
spread” means, I’ll do a
quick walk-through. The goal
with this trade is to sell
premium and take advantage
of the rapid premium decay



==================================================
                    PAGE 2032                     
==================================================

into expiration. This is
especially attractive when a
stock gets extended (up or
down) right into its TTM
reversion bands. It’s even
more attractive if this
happens with only a few days
until options expiration. With
the advent of weekly options,
these types of setups happen
with increased frequency.
The goal is to sell an at-the-
money option (the higher-
priced option), and then



==================================================
                    PAGE 2033                     
==================================================

hedge your risk by buying
the next strike out (the
cheaper option).

Figure 10.7
Figure 10.8 shows the
actual position. At point 1,
I’m short 100 of the 240 call
options (shown as –100 on
the TD Ameritrade
thinkorswim platform). This
means that I sold them to
someone else, and I hope
they expire worthless so that
I can collect the entire
premium. However, I didn’t
want to have completely



==================================================
                    PAGE 2038                     
==================================================

open exposure, either. What
if AMZN gapped up $50.00
the next day on some crazy
news? I’d be hosed. That’s
just not worth the risk,
however unlikely the event.
To protect myself and limit
my losses, I also bought 100
of the 245 calls, as seen at
point 2. This way, if AMZN
does skyrocket higher, my
loss is limited, as the 245
calls would increase in value,
and my loss would be limited

                    PAGE 2039                     
==================================================

to the spread between the
two strikes. In this screen
shot, you can see that I’m
making money on the options
I sold. They are up
$31,300.00. I’m losing
money on the options I
bought; they are down
$17,150.00. My net profit on
the trade is +$14,150.00.
Since I sold this spread for
$2.30, my maximum profit
(should AMZN close under
$240) is $230 per contract, or



==================================================
                    PAGE 2040                     
==================================================

$23,000 on 100 contracts.
My maximum loss is the
spread difference (245 – 240
= $5.00), which is 5.00 –
2.30 = $2.70, or $270 per
contract. Of course, there is
no need to hold the trade into
expiration. If the spread is
“in the money” there is a risk
of being assigned the stock
before expiration. This
happens rarely but it
happens, and isn’t a big deal.
Once assigned the stock, you



==================================================
                    PAGE 2041                     
==================================================

just close out the stock
position. This is why I started

the two option prices is
calculated continually, so it’s
easy to track. Figure 10.9
shows the actual vertical
price of the “240/245.” Since
I sold it for 2.30, and it’s
currently trading at 1.39
bid/1.56 ask, I’m up on the
spread. My stop loss on the
spread was 3.50, and if the
vertical combination had
reached that level, I would
have been stopped out. Once
you understand the power of

                    PAGE 2044

a matter of just being patient
and waiting for a nice
extended entry, such as a
slam into the one of the
bands right before expiration.

Wealth?
In the previous chapter, we
discussed reversion to the
mean (RTM) trading, and
how it’s the best type of
trading to do “unless there is
a squeeze.” And that really is
trading in a nutshell—
playing the reversion back to
the mean via something like
a pivot, an extreme $TICK
reading, or an outer reversion
band test, or riding a freshly



==================================================
                    PAGE 2050                     
==================================================

released burst of momentum
via something like the
squeeze. If one of these isn’t
being set up, then the other
is. Be patient and pick your
poison.
The squeeze is a setup that
I use for everything: day
trading, swing trading, and
position trading. It’s the best
indicator I’ve found for
setting up longer-term
moves, especially on the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2051                     
==================================================

larger daily, weekly, and
monthly time frames. In fact,
I find it very difficult to look
at a chart without this
indicator. It gives me a lot of
information about the nature
of the current market and
time frame with a quick
glance. We aren’t talking
about “overbought or
oversold,” which, like most
Twitter updates, is both self-
serving and useless. We are
talking about seeing whether



==================================================
                    PAGE 2052                     
==================================================

a market is neutral (in which
case we focus on RTM
trading) or, if it’s not neutral,
whether it’s building up
energy, about to release
energy, or about to run out of
energy. This is very useful
information for deciding
when and where to allocate
trading capital, as well as
deciding what type of trading
strategy to utilize with that
capital. Want one quick
example of how this



==================================================
                    PAGE 2053                     
==================================================

information is useful? You
might think that when a trade
is “about to run out of
energy,” it is merely a signal
to exit a current position. It is
that, yes, but it is also so
much more. When a squeeze
is running out of energy, it’s
also one of the best times to
start selling options
premium. (Buh-bam!) But I
digress. We still need to
discuss what a squeeze
actually represents.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2054                     
==================================================

In a nutshell, I like to use
RTM trading for the creation
of income (taking profits out
of an account) and squeeze-
type momentum trades on
larger time frames for the
creation of wealth (gradually
building up the value of an
account over time). Can a
trader utilize squeezes on
smaller time frames, though,
for day trading? Like a five-
minute chart? Absolutely,
and I’ll cover specific



==================================================
                    PAGE 2055                     
==================================================

examples that utilize smaller
time frames for day trading.
But where this setup really
shines is on the bigger time
frames. Hourly charts, two-
hour, daily, weekly, monthly
… there is never any reason
to not understand what is
going on with the bigger time
frames, and, should a
squeeze be firing off on one
of these larger time frames,
there is never any reason to
fight it on the lower time



==================================================
                    PAGE 2056                     
==================================================

frames. For example, if a 60-
minute chart has fired off a
long squeeze on the S&P
500, then only the
uninformed are pulling their
hair out entering short signals
on the five-minute chart
during that time. “Jeez,” they
say, “this thing just keeps
going higher!” Yep.
Even if a weekly squeeze
is too long a time frame for
your own trading plan, at the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2057                     
==================================================

very least it pays to be aware
of it so that you are not
“fighting against it” on the
smaller time frames. That is,
if the weekly squeeze on
AAPL has fired off a short
signal (hey, it could happen),
then why waste time buying
the dips on the daily chart?
These trades are very likely
going to be stopped out until
that weekly squeeze short
signal is over. It’s as if one
person offered you $8.00 an



==================================================
                    PAGE 2058                     
==================================================

hour to flip burgers, and
another guy offered you
$100.00 an hour to do the
exact same job. Which offer
would you take? Fighting the
weekly squeeze is like taking
the $8.00-an-hour job, when
you could just “go with the
squeeze” and get the
$100.00-per-hour job. By
following the larger time
frames, a trader is always
moving along the path of
least resistance— trading in



==================================================
                    PAGE 2059                     
==================================================

alignment with the larger
time frames. Knowledge is
power.
On average, a squeeze
signal lasts about six bars.
This means that a signal on a
monthly chart can last for six
months, while a signal on a
one-minute chart can last for
six minutes. The signal is the
same no matter what the time
frame; it’s just the duration
of “being in the trade” that



==================================================
                    PAGE 2060                     
==================================================

changes.
Why bother with swing
trades and overnight
exposure? I know that some
traders freak out when they
have overnight exposure, and
that’s fine. I, for one, have
trouble sleeping if I don’t
have a position on. The
benefit of these types of
swing trades is that a person
is “in” the market and
already positioned for the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2061                     
==================================================

move. While day traders can
catch a few points here and
there, it’s the swing traders
that catch big multiday and
even multiweek moves. It’s
okay to prefer one type of
trading over the other. The
key with trading is to find the
niche in which you will
shine.
The markets spend a lot of
time in trading ranges,
building up energy for their



==================================================
                    PAGE 2062                     
==================================================

next major move. By the
time the move fires off, it is
usually out of the blue and
violent, leaving many day
traders behind. This includes
the times when a market will
gap open and then spend the
rest of the day stuck in a
narrow range, totally
bypassing the day traders.
That’s why we call this move
a “gap and crap.” By keeping
some exposure in positions
on a swing-type basis, I will



==================================================
                    PAGE 2063                     
==================================================

frequently participate in
larger moves that leapfrog
over many of the day traders.
The secret to swing trading is
realizing that “being
positioned” is half the battle,
and not stressing out over a
position that is not working
out right away. The markets
never break when they are
expected to, and they will do
so only when they are good
and ready, usually when the
greatest number of people are



==================================================
                    PAGE 2064                     
==================================================

unprepared. Sometimes
being positioned means
waiting weeks for the move
to finally unfold. This
requires patience and the
ability to step aside and not
obsessively stare at the charts
all day. This is a huge
problem for most traders.
They sit back, they watch the
charts, they get emotional,
and they get faked out and
close the trade. Typically,
once that process has

                    PAGE 2065                     
==================================================

completed itself— faking out
as many traders as possible—
the markets will make their
move. If everybody is
expecting a move, then
everybody will already be
positioned for it. If
everybody is positioned for a
big down move, then
everybody is already short
and there is no one left to
sell. It’s a great system. It’s
also how the markets always
have worked and always will

                    PAGE 2066

work.
One of the best trading
books I’ve ever read on
managing “swing trader
anxiety” is called How I
Made Two Million Dollars in
the Stock Market, by Nicolas
Darvas. This book was
written a few decades ago
and remains one of my
favorites. It’s a quick, easy
read and very entertaining.
For anyone who has trouble



==================================================
                    PAGE 2067                     
==================================================

hanging on to swing
positions and jumps out too
early, this book is a must
read.
It is important to position
size correctly for swing
trades. In general, if traders
cannot sleep because they are
worrying about their
overnight positions, then they
are trading too large in
relation to their account size.
Swing trades have larger



==================================================
                    PAGE 2068                     
==================================================

stops, and their position size
must be reduced accordingly.
There is a very easy way to
manage this—establish a
monetary stop and work
backward from there. For
example, if traders are not
willing to lose more than
$500 on a trade, then all they
have to do is look at the
parameters for the setup and
do the math to figure out the
position size. Using $500 as
a benchmark, a day trade that



==================================================
                    PAGE 2069                     
==================================================

requires a 20-point stop in
the mini-sized Dow futures
would equate to a position
size of five contracts.
However, if a swing trade in
the mini-sized Dow called
for a 100-point stop, then
these same traders are going
to use one lot. Monetarily,
these stops are identical
because of the reduced
position size on the swing
trade.

How Does a Trader
Redefine Volatility and Use
It to His Advantage?
The squeeze takes advantage
of quiet periods in the
market, when the volatility
has decreased significantly
and the market is building up
energy for its next major
move higher or lower. My
wife and I have three young
children, and recently she
deemed me responsible



==================================================
                    PAGE 2071                     
==================================================

enough to watch them by
myself on a Saturday at the
house. After she left, I made
sure all the doors that led
outside and into the
bedrooms were closed and
locked so that I wouldn’t lose
track of them. I discovered
very quickly that if they were
making noise, they were fine.
But if things suddenly got
very, very quiet, then
something bad was fixin’ to
happen. This is when I would



==================================================
                    PAGE 2072                     
==================================================

come around the corner and
see the two older ones trying
to stuff the younger one into
a potted plant. Energy,
having been built up, was
being released.
For students of Bollinger
Bands, periods of low
volatility are identified as the
times when the bands “move
closer together.” This is the
equivalent of “the kids being
quiet around the corner.”



==================================================
                    PAGE 2073                     
==================================================

That is, this particular market
has gotten “too quiet” and is
about to release a truckload
of energy.
This is always great in
hindsight, but in real time,
how does a trader know that
the current narrowness of the
Bollinger Bands is really
narrow enough to qualify as
low volatility and to qualify
as “just about to release a lot
of energy”? This setup



==================================================
                    PAGE 2074                     
==================================================

answers that question by
adding the Keltner Channels
as well as a momentum index
oscillator.
For readers who are
unaware of how these
indicators work, I’ll take a
few moments to explain them
here. Bollinger Bands are a
type of envelope that is
plotted at standard deviation
levels above and below a
moving average. This



==================================================
                    PAGE 2075                     
==================================================

produces an effect of having
the bands widen during
periods of higher volatility
and contract during less
volatile periods. During
periods of lower volatility, in
sideways-moving markets,
the bands contract toward the
moving average. Keltner
Channels are based on a
standard moving average.
The actual band lines are
offset from the central
moving average value by a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2076                     
==================================================

positive and negative
standard deviation value to
provide upper and lower
bands. While the Bollinger
Bands expand and contract as
the markets alter between
periods of high and low
volatility, the Keltner
Channels stay in more of a
steady range. The momentum
index oscillator is used to
estimate the direction,
velocity, and turning points
of market movements. Does



==================================================
                    PAGE 2077                     
==================================================

this make sense? If not, that’s
fine. I don’t understand how
electricity works, but I know
when I plug my computer
into an electric outlet, it will
turn on. Now let’s look at
how I use all this for a setup.
The quiet periods I’m
looking for are identified
when the Bollinger Bands
narrow in width to the point
where they are actually
inside of the Keltner



==================================================
                    PAGE 2078                     
==================================================

Channels. This marks a
period of reduced volatility
and signals that the market is
taking a significant breather,
building up steam for its next
move. The trade signal
occurs when the Bollinger
Bands then move back
outside the Keltner Channels.
I use a 12-period momentum
index oscillator to determine
whether to go long or short.
If the oscillator is above zero
when this happens, I go long;



==================================================
                    PAGE 2079                     
==================================================

if it is below zero, I go short.
These are all canned studies
that come with most charting
packages. For the
parameters, I just use the
default settings on
TradeStation. These readings
are 20 and 1.5 for the Keltner
Channels and 20 and 2 for
the Bollinger Bands. We also
took an extra step and turned
all these into an indicator that
makes them easier to read on
the chart; I’ll explain this in a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2080                     
==================================================

moment.
What Is the Best Way to
Get in Right Before a Big
Move?
I use the squeeze signal on
various time frames, as I like
it for both day trading and
swing trading. On the mini-
sized Dow, for example, a
squeeze can move the market
10 to 20 YM points on a two-
minute chart or a 377 tick



==================================================
                    PAGE 2081                     
==================================================

chart, 30 to 50 points on a
15-minute chart, and several
hundred points on a daily
chart. The kicker, of course,
is that the smaller the time
frame, the more frequent the
signals. A two-minute chart
may fire off three to five
signals in a day, while the
daily chart will fire off six to
seven signals over the course
of an entire year.
Although I spend a large



==================================================
                    PAGE 2082                     
==================================================

amount of my trading day
focused on the E-mini S&Ps
and the mini-sized Dow,
there are also plenty of times
when these indexes are dead
in the water. On days when
the indexes are trading in a
range that is narrower than
Donald Trump’s political
ambitions, I look to the
currencies, gold, bonds, oil,
and individual stocks for my
next setup. My two favorite
setups in the currencies are



==================================================
                    PAGE 2083                     
==================================================

the squeeze play and what I
call the box play—a setup
that comes up in a later
chapter. For currencies, I
execute these on the eight
currency pairs I’ve already
mentioned, and I prefer to do
these in the futures markets
when possible. Let’s take a
look at some setups.
What Are the Trading
Rules for Buys (Sells Are
Reversed)?



==================================================
                    PAGE 2084                     
==================================================

1. Set up a 24-hour chart
so that the overnight
activity can be
accounted for in this
indicator setup.
2. The “heads-up” on
this indicator is the
first black dot. This is
not a trade signal, but
rather a heads-up that
a trade signal is
setting up. This
indicates when the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2085                     
==================================================

Bollinger Bands are
trading inside the
Keltner Channels.
3. The signal on the
indicator is the first
gray dot after a series
of black dots. This
indicates that the
Bollinger Bands have
come back outside of
the Keltner Channels.
This is shown in
detail in the charts



==================================================
                    PAGE 2086                     
==================================================

that follow.
4. Once the first gray
dot appears after a
series of black dots, I
go long if the
histogram is above
zero. Once the signal
fires, I just place a
market order. This is
a momentum play,
and I don’t want to
be messing around
with limit orders that



==================================================
                    PAGE 2087                     
==================================================

may not get filled.
Note: though
unusual, there are
also instances in
which, when the
signal fires,
momentum is below
zero, yet it is
ascending. This also
constitutes a long
signal.
5. For day trades (five-
minute charts or



==================================================
                    PAGE 2088                     
==================================================

smaller), I place the
following minimum
money management
stops. If the stop is
also near a key price
support level, I will
take that into
consideration and
adjust accordingly.
For example, if my
entry is 1104.00 on
the S&Ps and the
daily pivot is at
1101.75, I would



==================================================
                    PAGE 2089                     
==================================================

move my stop to just
below that pivot
level, or 1101.50, for
a stop of 2.50 instead
of 2.00. I find that
nine times out of ten,
I just use the default
stop. Remember, too,
that if you are unsure
of what stop to use,
then you can place
the 14-period average
true range (ATR) on
your chart, double the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2090                     
==================================================

current value, and use
that as your stop.
• YM: 20 points
• ES: 2 points
• NQ: 4 points
• TF: 1.50 points
• EC: 20 ticks
• EURUSD: 20 pips
• US: 7 ticks



==================================================
                    PAGE 2091                     
==================================================

• Gold: 1.50
• Stocks: 50 cents
6. For swing plays and
position trades (taken
off the daily charts), I
place the following
stops. I take into
consideration the
same key levels as
discussed in item 4,
and of course it is
very beneficial to
look at a 14-period



==================================================
                    PAGE 2092                     
==================================================

ATR on the daily
charts, as the range
on this time frame
can expand and
contract dramatically
with increases and
decreases in
volatility. The main
point here is that if
you are trying to
catch a bigger move
in the ES, there is no
point in using a 2-
point ES stop



==================================================
                    PAGE 2093                     
==================================================

because the
probability of being
stopped out is too
high.
• YM: 150 points
• ES: 15 points
• NQ: 25 points
• TF: 8 points
• EC: 100 ticks
• EURUSD: 100 pips



==================================================
                    PAGE 2094                     
==================================================

• US: 35 ticks
• Gold: 20.00
• Stocks: $2.50
7. My target is based
purely on the
momentum of the
trade. Once the
momentum index
signal starts to
weaken, I get out of
the trade at the
market.

                    PAGE 2095

8. I don’t trail stops.
Let’s first look at
examples from the first
edition of this book, and then
we will take a look at some
updated examples.

how to set up the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2096                     
==================================================

elements of this play
in whatever time
frame a trader wishes
to view. For intraday
trading, I like to
watch the five-minute
chart. The one-and
two-minute charts are
good for scalping, but
these signals are not
as powerful as those
of the five-minute
chart, though they are
tradable. The Keltner

                    PAGE 2097

Channels are the pair
of thick black lines
and are set at the
default parameters of
20 and 1.5 on
TradeStation. The
Bollinger Bands are
the thinner gray lines
and are set at the
default settings of 20
and 2.0. At the
bottom is a 12-period

momentum index

                    PAGE 2098                     
==================================================

oscillator. At point 1,
the Bollinger Bands
have gone inside the
Keltner Channels.
This indicates that the
market is going into a
quiet period, and it is
a heads-up. This is
not a signal— it is
just a heads-up that
when the Bollinger
Bands pop back out,
it will be time to take
a trade.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2099

2. At point 2, the
Bollinger Bands have
come back outside
the Keltner Channels.
It is time to take a
trade.
3. If the momentum
index oscillator is
above zero at the
time of point 2, I go
long. If it is below

                    PAGE 2101                     
==================================================

zero at this point, I go
short. I don’t mess
around with limit
orders. I just jump it
at the market, hitting
the current offers.
This is just an
example of what
triggers the entry and
exits. I look at
specific plays in a
moment.

1. One of the things we
did was turn all the
things in Figure 11.1
into an easy-to-read
indicator, which is
what I now use on
my own charts, as
seen in Figure 11.2.
We have developed
this for TradeStation,
eSignal,

==================================================

thinkorswim, Infinity
Futures, Ninja
Trader, and other
platforms as well.
When the Bollinger
Bands go inside the
Keltner Channels, the
dots turn black. This
is a heads-up that the
markets have entered
a quiet period.

==================================================

Figure 11.2
2. At point 2, the
Bollinger Bands
come back out of the
Keltner Channels.
3. Since the momentum
index oscillator is
above zero at point 3,
this is a long signal.
4. On the indicator itself
at the bottom of the
chart, this is all



==================================================
                    PAGE 2106                     
==================================================

measured by when
the dots turn back to
gray after being
black. This occurs at
point 4. The black
dots are the heads-up
that the market has
“gone quiet” and is
about to release a
truckload of energy.
When I see that first
gray dot after the
series of black dots, I
know it is time to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2107                     
==================================================

take a trade. If the
histogram is above
the zero line, I go
long, and if it is
below the zero line, I
go short. Again, this
is just to show you
how the indicator
works. In the next
examples, I go over
some actual plays. I
prefer to take off all
the “clutter” that is
on the price chart and



==================================================
                    PAGE 2108                     
==================================================

just use the indicator.
But now you know
how the indicator
works.
Mini-Sized Dow—September
2004 Contract, August 20,
2004
1. On this two-minute chart
of the mini-sized Dow, we
get a black dot a little after
10:00 a.m. eastern (see
Figure 11.3). This is a signal



==================================================
                    PAGE 2109                     
==================================================

that the Bollinger Bands have
narrowed and are now
trading inside the Keltner
Channels. I know that when I
get the next gray dot, I will
have a trade signal. In this
case, the gray dot happens
right away. Usually there is
more than one black dot, but
once in a while it will have
just the single instance, and
that’s okay. Common sense
dictates that the more black
dots there are, the more



==================================================
                    PAGE 2110                     
==================================================

powerful the potential move
will be. In my experience,
this is not true, as I have seen
one-dot signals that have
bigger moves than twenty-
dot signals on numerous
occasions. I find it is best to
just take the signal when it
comes. Humans tend to mess
up their trading when they
try to outthink their
positions. When the next
gray dot appears, the
histogram is above zero, so I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2111                     
==================================================

place an order to buy the YM
at the market. I am filled at
10,164. I place a 20-point
stop at 10,144. My target is
open, as I’ll be waiting for
the momentum index to falter
as my exit signal.

the trade as long as

exit as it starts to turn
higher.) I’m out at
10,325 for a gain of
101 points, or $505
per contract—a very
smooth, low-stress,
and profitable trade.
This is a great
example of a trade
where it pays to sit
on your hands until
you are given a clear
exit signal. In fact,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2120                     
==================================================

part of my reward
system isn’t focused
on profits— it’s
focused on my ability
to follow a setup
from entry to exit.
Every trader should
have a reward system
like this: not for
making money, but
for hanging in there
and following the
setup—staying in the
trade until you get a

specific exit signal.
Taking tiny profits is
easy, which is what
most traders do. And
that is why most
traders fail; they
always succumb to
the easy way out, the
bad habits that the
markets naturally
encourage and
reinforce. When a
trade is going your
way, stick your hands

1. On September 10,
2004, the five-minute

earlier, there was a

                    PAGE 2123                     
==================================================

went long here.
However, the very
next dot went back to
black. This means
that the Bollinger
Bands came out of
the Keltner Channels,
but then went right
back in. This is a rare
occurrence, but when
it happens, I just get
out and wait for a
solid signal. In that
case, I was in and out

About 50 minutes
later, we get the setup
again, and the dots
turn gray. For this
next trade, with the
histogram above
zero, I go long and
place a 20-point stop.
I am in at 10,263, and
I place a stop at

When the next gray

                    PAGE 2134                     
==================================================

I’ve found that when
there is a big move, it
is generally kicked
off by a squeeze on
the five-minute chart.
I have a rule in
trading that says,
“Never fight the
direction of the five-
minute squeeze!” It
supersedes all my
other intraday trading
rules and setups.
Remember when I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2135

talked about all these
plays working in
conjunction with one
another? If there is a
five-minute long
squeeze in place and
we are rallying up to
a pivot level, then
I’m not going to
place a short at that
pivot level. Never
fight the five-minute
squeeze.

because it clearly
shows the power of
an intraday

the market spends
most of the morning
consolidating, and, as
the volatility comes

This shows up in the
form of black dots.

on other markets as
well. Figure 11.12 is

place a 7-tick stop at

wait for the next gray

various currency

wake up to see that
the euro has just fired
off a short squeeze on
the 60-minute chart
(see Figure 11.18). I
go in and short at the
market, getting filled
at 1.2252. I place a
20-pip stop at 1.2272.
(Remember, 1 pip in
this currency pair
equals of a cent
and equates to $10 on
your P&L.)

to go clear my head. I
exit at the market and

1. I like to watch the

stocks as well,
especially on daily
time frames, since
most of my stock
trading involves
swing trading. I also
use the daily squeeze
on individual stocks
for in-the-money
option plays. I talk

more about how I
play options in the
chapter on the “8/21

setup. That said, I
will use the five-

volatile stocks for
potential intraday
trading setups. Figure

==================================================

price action shortly
after its IPO (initial
public offering). On
September 9, 2004,
the stock goes into a
squeeze setup at the
end of the day, and
this carries into the
beginning of the next
day. Very soon after
the open, we get our
first gray dot, and,
since the histogram is
above zero, I take a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2197

long at the market.

Another squeeze play
sets up later in the
afternoon and fires
off right after 12
noon. On this play,
the histogram is

                    PAGE 2200

negative, and I would
normally short, but
since it was an IPO,
shares were not
available to the
general public to
short at this time, so I
obviously passed on
this trade.
What Is the Biggest Mistake
New Traders Make?
Squeezes show me when the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2201                     
==================================================

markets go into quiet mode.
The only reason markets go
into quiet mode is that they
are building up energy for
their next major move. Many
new traders make the classic
mistake of waking up in the
morning and “looking for
which markets are on the
move.” They see that AAPL
is up 5 points and buy the
stock, or, worse, they buy
out-of-the-money calls. Or
they see that the euro is down



==================================================
                    PAGE 2202                     
==================================================

40 ticks and they stumble
over themselves to short it.
They are chasing the action.
Well, they are late to the
party, and they are most
likely going to be buying
positions from people like
me who are exiting squeeze
trades on losses of
momentum. Traders who
chase markets, like dogs that
chase cars, eventually get run
over.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2203                     
==================================================

I like to sneak into the
markets when they are quiet,
before everyone else knows
what is going on. With the
squeeze, I have a clear
indication of when to take
the trade. And once I’m in, I
just don’t mess with the
trade. When it starts to lose
momentum, it is pretty clear,
and that is the signal I use to
get out.
Many day traders I talk to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2204                     
==================================================

ask about the wisdom of
swing trading. The biggest
question I get involves the
risk in being exposed to an
overnight position. “What if
there is another terrorist
attack?” After trading the
markets for nearly 20 years,
there is one thing I am
absolutely convinced of—
there is always somebody
who knows about the
upcoming market move, and
this person is in the process



==================================================
                    PAGE 2205                     
==================================================

of getting positioned for it.
After the crash on 9/11, one
of the ways the government
tracked down terrorist cells
was to look at all the
brokerage accounts that
showed heavy short selling in
the weeks before the attack,
especially of insurance and
airline stocks. This led to
multiple arrests, as people
who knew about the
upcoming attacks had been
shorting these stocks



==================================================
                    PAGE 2206                     
==================================================

aggressively. Out of the
blue? Let’s look at a few
market crashes and just see
how “out of the blue” they
really were.
Is It Possible to Get
Positioned Before a Market
Crash?
I don’t mean to belittle the
events of 9/11 by viewing
them as merely a “trade
setup.” I lost friends, and I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2207                     
==================================================

know many people who lost
friends and loved ones in that
attack. The point of this is
that the event should not
scare us and make us cower
in the corner. It should not
keep us from taking risks,
whether it involves getting
on a plane, visiting another
country, embracing people
from other cultures, or
having exposure to overnight
positions. Living scared can
hardly be called living.

sign that there is a lot
of steady, quiet
selling going on in
this market. There is
no reason to be long
this market. If you
have a retirement
account or 401(k)
that is invested in
stocks, this is the
time to switch to 100
percent cash or
bonds, even though

when you call in to
do it, your “advisor”
will try to talk you
out of it. Why would
she do that? She
makes more in fees if
you are invested in
stocks. You can get
back into stocks once
the squeeze has lost
its downside
momentum.

==================================================
                    PAGE 2213                     
==================================================

and the momentum
on the squeeze is still
strong. Did we know
about the looming
terrorist attacks and
that the market was
going to crash? No. I
didn’t, anyway, and
99.99 percent of the
population on the
planet didn’t know
either. However, as a
trader and investor, I
did know that there



==================================================
                    PAGE 2214                     
==================================================

was (1) no reason to
be long the current
market, in which case
I have the option to
sell all my stocks and
sit in cash in my
retirement accounts,
and (2) as a trader,
there were numerous
sell signals here and
plenty of time to get
short. On a play like
this, I like to buy
slightly in-the-money



==================================================
                    PAGE 2215                     
==================================================

put options on SPY
and DIA at least six
weeks out, and then I
can just sit on those
options while the
squeeze unfolds.
After 9/11, the markets
were closed and didn’t
reopen until September 17.
The Dow closed at 9605 on
September 10, and after the
next trading day, closed at
8920.70, down nearly 700

points. Again, leading into
this, there was no reason to
be long in this market. Even
though we didn’t know what
was about to happen,
somebody did. The charts do
not lie. This is why listening
to the news is so worthless—
all it does is tell you what has
already happened, as it has
no idea what’s going to
happen next, and in between
doing this, it lets people try
to sell you stuff via

Dow Cash Index—October
19, 1987
1. There was another
big crash on October
19, 1987 (see Figure
11.22). This was the
year I graduated from
high school, and one
of my fondest trading
memories is having



==================================================
                    PAGE 2218                     
==================================================

owned a put on IBM
during the crash. I
wish I could say that
I had seen the crash
coming, but it was
pure luck. I had a
bunch of calls, read
something about
hedging, and bought
a put on IBM. The
put saved my bacon
and then some,
although my calls
didn’t fare too badly



==================================================
                    PAGE 2219                     
==================================================

because of the
increase in implied
volatility—again, at
the time, I had no
clue what that was
either (see Chapter
5). If I’d had the
squeeze at this time, I
would have noted
that the daily squeeze
fired off a short
signal on October 9,
ten full days before
the crash, and I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2220                     
==================================================

wouldn’t have owned
any calls. I’d have
played the move for
what it was; instead
of hedging my longs,
I’d have just gotten
short. We are, of
course, all geniuses
in hindsight!

Figure 11.22
2. Then on October 14,
the markets broke
down from a
descending wedge
pattern. There were
now two reasons not
to be long in the
markets. There are
times to buy the dip,
and there are times to
shun the dip. When
the squeeze is firing



==================================================
                    PAGE 2223                     
==================================================

off short, shun the
dip.
On October 19, the
markets crashed. Those who
were already positioned for
the move had a nice trading
day. Those who didn’t have
the squeeze to guide them
experienced new variations
of the meaning of pain.
Dow Cash Index—the Crash
of 1929



==================================================
                    PAGE 2224                     
==================================================

The crash in 1929 was no
picnic, either. I talked to one
trader who was there when it
happened. He is over 90
years old now and still
actively trades. To him,
nothing has changed, and it’s
all the same game.
Remember that in the first
chapter, I talk about markets
moving not because they
want to, but because they
have to? We talk about
TASR in that example.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2225                     
==================================================

Along these same lines, here
is the quick narrative of the
crash of 1929.
On the night of Monday,
October 21, 1929, margin
calls were heavy, and Dutch
and German calls came in
from overseas to sell
overnight for the Tuesday
morning opening (see Figure
11.23). On Tuesday morning,
out-of-town banks and
corporations sent in $150



==================================================
                    PAGE 2226                     
==================================================

million of call loans, and
Wall Street was in a panic
before the New York Stock
Exchange opened. The
selling was heavy, but the
influx of cash staved off a
crash.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2227                     
==================================================

                    PAGE 2228                     
==================================================

Figure 11.23
Unfortunately, on
Thursday, October 24, 1929,
more margin calls hit, and
people began to sell their
stocks as fast as they could.
Sell orders flooded the
market exchanges, the ticker
was running more than an
hour behind on price quotes,
and the markets sold off
hard, but not enough to be
considered a crash. The



==================================================
                    PAGE 2229                     
==================================================

exchange directed all
employees to be on the floor,
since there were numerous
margin calls and sell orders
placed overnight for the next
trading day. Extra telephone
staff was also arranged at the
members’ boxes around the
floor. The Dow Jones
average closed at 299 that
day.
On Tuesday, October 29,
1929, the crash began.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2230                     
==================================================

Within the first few hours,
the prices fell so far that they
wiped out all gains that had
been made in the entire
previous year. This day, the
Dow Jones average closed at
230. This is like the Dow
losing 2,400 points in one
day today. Between October
29 and November 13, more
than $30 billion disappeared
from the American economy
—and these were 1929
dollars. It took nearly 25



==================================================
                    PAGE 2231                     
==================================================

years for many of the stocks
to recover.
The Dow finally bottomed
out in July 1932 at near 40.
That is like the Dow going
from 10,000 to 1,100 in the
year 2005.
Coming back full circle, it
is important to note that a
short squeeze fired off on the
daily chart before the 1929
crash. Yes, terrorist attacks
and crashes are scary things,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2232                     
==================================================

but the squeeze is designed
to give traders a heads-up on
which way the markets are
going to break, so that they
aren’t caught with their pants
down.

==================================================

delta 0.70 option. These
types of trades do not need to
be managed intraday. Even
though I watch the markets
full time, I do not watch my
swing trades intraday. There
is no point. My parameters
are in place, and the only
thing I’m going to do if I
watch my position is try to
outsmart it, which never
works in the long run. In
addition to individual stocks,
this can be used for sectors



==================================================
                    PAGE 2235                     
==================================================

and ETFs, and for
commodities as well. As an
added benefit, if you are
working a full-time job and
can’t watch the markets
intraday, you are actually at
an advantage. In that type of
situation, a lot of the
psychological stuff that I
discussed in Chapter 2
doesn’t even have a chance
to come up. Place the trade,
set your parameters, go to
work, and log in later to see



==================================================
                    PAGE 2236

what happened. There is a lot
of wisdom to that approach.
Updated Examples for the
2008 Financial Crisis and
Beyond
During times of great
uncertainty, which we’ve had
ever since the financial crisis
of 2008 hit the world,
indicators like the squeeze
take on added importance.
They allow a trader and



==================================================
                    PAGE 2237                     
==================================================

investor to stay calm, make
decisions, and not get sucked
into all the misinformation
that’s being spread around
like so much cow manure.
Let’s take a look at a few
examples of how this all
played out. Also remember
my discussion of the
AUDJPY currency cross
from Chapter 6. This plays
strongly into understanding
“what the hell is going on” in
today’s financial markets.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2238                     
==================================================

It’s always good to know
when hedge funds are buying
and when they start selling.
This way, you can sidestep
the freight train when it
comes your way.
In Figure 11.24, we have a
weekly chart of silver. This is
a classic example of a
squeeze. At point 2, the
silver market had been
consolidating between
$15.00 and $20.00 for over a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2239                     
==================================================

year. People who had bought
at $20.00 were anxious,
while people who had bought
at $15.00 felt slightly more
comfortable. For long-term
bullion holders who want to
own silver forever, this isn’t
too much of a concern. But
for traders, part of the key is
knowing “when to put capital
where.” It would have been
possible to buy silver at
$20.00 a year and a half too
early. That money would



==================================================
                    PAGE 2240                     
==================================================

have been essentially “dead
money” from a trading
perspective, as it could have
been put to work elsewhere.
At point 2, we can see that
a squeeze has been setting up
for several weeks. This
means, of course, that the
silver market is getting ready
to potentially release a
truckload of energy. In this
case, it initiated the move
that eventually saw silver



==================================================
                    PAGE 2241                     
==================================================

soar to $50.00 an ounce. It is
during this time, during the
“squeeze period,” that a
trader wants to look at taking
a position in silver. This
could be done in many ways:
buying the silver ETF (SLV),
buying call options on SLV,
buying silver futures, buying
call options on silver futures,
buying silver mining stocks,
or even buying silver bullion.
And a trader could take this a
step further and initiate



==================================================
                    PAGE 2242                     
==================================================

option positions in SLV that
would benefit from a rise in
SLV—selling naked puts and
so forth. The key is having
and understanding the signal
(in this case, seeing that
silver was potentially about
to go higher) and then
choosing the variety of
trading strategies around this
signal that best fit your
personality and trading goals.



==================================================

                    PAGE 2244                     
==================================================

Figure 11.24
At point 1, there is a
squeeze that fires off a short
signal in silver. As you can
see from the chart, this move
did not last long, though
silver did fall from $20.00
back toward the $15.00 level.
In the next chapter, I’m
going to talk about a filter for
the squeeze that filters out
setups like that—setups that
may not have a whole lot of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2245                     
==================================================

conviction.
Figure 11.25 shows a
weekly chart of the S&P 500
futures. Point 1 shows a
squeeze that results in a
multimonth 20 percent spurt
higher at a time when there
was extreme bearish
sentiment about the markets
as a result of the European
bailouts. And yet, the market
ignored the news and rallied
anyway. At point 2, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2246                     
==================================================

European situation had
continued to get worse, and
the stock market had had
some serious selling, falling
from 1200 all the way back
to 950. People were getting
jittery. At point 2, a squeeze
took shape and fired off long,
and the S&P 500 started one
of its most ferocious 35
percent rallies in recent
memory. Day after day, week
after week, shorts got
clobbered on this rally as



==================================================
                    PAGE 2247                     
==================================================

they fought the advance
every step of the way. And
why not? The news was
negative every day! Traders
who were following the
squeeze didn’t fight it. They
just got long and waited for
the exit signal to get out, no
matter how negative the
commentary spewing forth
from the financial press. At
point 3, in July 2011, the
S&Ps started setting up
another squeeze, and this one



==================================================
                    PAGE 2248                     
==================================================

fired off short. Again, once
this happens, there is no
reason to be long on stocks,
no matter what the news is
saying, and aggressive
traders can go one step
further and get short. Isn’t
this a lot easier than scanning
the news every day for hours,
trying to figure out what is
going to happen next? Of
course, if the S&P 500 is
firing off a squeeze,
individual stocks will also



==================================================
                    PAGE 2249                     
==================================================

follow. If I see the S&P 500
set up a signal, I will also
look at taking positions in
key stocks like AAPL,
BIDU, PCLN, and so on that
will benefit from a move in
the S&P 500.

Figure 11.25
The king of the squeeze
charts is the monthly chart.
Although squeezes don’t set
up on these charts very often,
once every few years, they
are hugely powerful. Figure
11.26 shows a monthly chart
of gold. Gold tends to have a
solid move, then consolidate
for 12 to 18 months, and then
have another solid move.
This can all be mapped out



==================================================
                    PAGE 2252                     
==================================================

and timed with the squeeze.
Point 1 shows a long squeeze
from the middle of 2002.
Point 2 shows a long squeeze
from the end of 2005. The
next squeeze took place two
years later at point 3 near the
end of 2007. Then, two years
later, near the end of 2009,
yet another monthly squeeze
fired off that launched gold
from $900 an ounce to over
$1,800 an ounce. As of this
writing in October 2011, it’s



==================================================
                    PAGE 2253                     
==================================================

time for gold to “go quiet”
again for another 12- to 18-
month period until its next
major monthly squeeze
signal. As with the trade in
silver, there are many ways
to utilize this information,
implementing strategies with
stocks, options, and futures.
Another critical chart to
watch is a weekly chart of
the U.S. dollar index, symbol
DXY (also referred to as



==================================================
                    PAGE 2254                     
==================================================

Dixie). The fundamentals on
the U.S. dollar are well
known and always point to
lower prices for our beloved
currency (he says, tongue in
cheek). That said, no market
moves straight up or straight
down, and while the Dixie
has a fundamental sob story,
there are moments when it
shines and will continue to
shine. Back in the good old
days, the U.S. dollar would
rally because our economy



==================================================
                    PAGE 2255                     
==================================================

was so strong when
compared to other major
economies. These days, the
U.S. dollar will rally during
periods of global economic
unrest. This is important to
realize because the price of
the U.S. dollar affects nearly
every other asset around the
world to some extent. The
dollar goes up? Guess what,
oil, gold, grains, and many
other commodities, and even
many stocks, go down in



==================================================
                    PAGE 2256                     
==================================================

price, as they are priced in
U.S. dollars (as U.S. dollars
get more valuable, it takes
less of them to buy the same
amount of gold, oil, and so
forth).



==================================================
                    PAGE 2257                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 2258                     
==================================================

Figure 11.26
What about quantitative
easing? Yes, this creates a lot
of new currency at the push
of a button, and in theory this
should push the dollar lower.
This would be true if so
many dollars weren’t being
destroyed by deflationary
real estate pressures. For
example, in 2009, there was
$1.1 trillion in new dollars
created by quantitative



==================================================
                    PAGE 2259                     
==================================================

easing. There was also $1.6
trillion in debt destroyed by
falling real estate prices. This
means that in 2009, despite
quantitative easing, the
supply of U.S. dollars
actually decreased by $500
billion, making the fewer
dollars that were left more
valuable. Luckily, a person
doesn’t have to understand or
even know about this. Just
look at the chart and follow
the squeeze signals.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2260                     
==================================================

The two big factors that
drive this currency higher
these days are (1) the
unwinding of the carry trade
(see the Chapter 6 discussion
of AUDJPY) and (2) global
economic recessions. In a
global recession, when
everything is slowing down,
the U.S. dollar starts to look
pretty good in comparison to
other fiat currencies. Think
of it as “the least stinky piece
of crap” floating to the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2261                     
==================================================

surface.
In Figure 11.27, we have a
weekly chart of the $DXY.
At the start of 2010, a long
squeeze fired off, and the
Dixie had a fantastic rally.
During this time, gold fell
from 1200 to 1000, the S&P
500 fell from 1215 to 1000,
the euro got clobbered from
1.50 to 1.19—the list goes on
and on. Even strong markets
like oil could only manage to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2262                     
==================================================

trade sideways during this
time. A strong dollar truly
affects everything, just as a
weak dollar also affects
everything. The key is not to
stick your head in the sand
and trust that the U.S. dollar
will continue weakening in a
straight line down. At point
2, there is a short squeeze,
and during this time, as the
U.S. dollar sold off, nearly
everything else rallied.
Stocks, gold, oil, euros—you



==================================================
                    PAGE 2263                     
==================================================

name it, it rallied. As I’m
writing this on October 8,
2011, the U.S. dollar has
recently fired off another
long squeeze (on fears of a
global recession—but of
course the reasoning doesn’t
really matter; just follow the
signal), sending the dollar
higher. This has been a
powerful signal, as prices of
gold, silver, stocks, and so
forth continue to fall apart.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2264                     
==================================================

The weekly squeeze is
also very useful for cutting
through the noise, which is
often confusing and
contradictory. In September
2010, RAX (Rackspace), a
web hosting company, was
getting a lot of negative
press. The stock was too
expensive, the P/E ratio was
too high, and the short
interest continued to climb as
hedge funds shorted the stock
in anticipation of a great fall.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2265                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 2266                     
==================================================

Figure 11.27
Figure 11.28 shows a
weekly chart of RAX.
During this time of negative
“this stock is way
overvalued” press, a weekly
squeeze slowly and quietly
started to develop. By the
time it fired off at point 2, it
launched the stock into a
move that would more than
double the price of the stock.
For weekly squeezes, a trader



==================================================
                    PAGE 2267                     
==================================================

can buy the stock outright or
buy in-the-money call
options a few months out.
For RAX, those who listened
to the negative press sold the
stock or, worse, shorted the
stock. Those who watched
the weekly squeeze and
brainlessly followed the
signal enjoyed an awesome
run higher in the price.

Figure 11.29
One thing about the
squeeze is that it doesn’t
really care what market you
watch. Figure 11.29 is a
weekly chart of soybeans. As
a trader, getting long soybean
futures at point 1 turned into
an incredibly profitable trade.
And there are other uses for
this type of information. For
a farmer who is trying to
decide whether to hedge his



==================================================
                    PAGE 2272                     
==================================================

crop at $10.00 (by shorting
soybean futures), this
squeeze proves to be very
useful information. “Don’t
hedge yet,” it screams. “At
least wait till the squeeze is
done.” When it’s done,
soybeans are closer to
$13.50. The farmer can
hedge his cash crop here and
lock in that profit. This can
also be done with gold and
silver bullion. Selling
physical gold and bullion can



==================================================
                    PAGE 2273                     
==================================================

be a huge pain. However,
hedging physical holdings is
super easy if you know how
to read the squeeze.
What Is the Best Way to
Filter Out Squeezes That
Might Not Work Out?
On the weekly chart of silver
in Figure 11.24, we saw a
squeeze signal at point 1 that
was tepid at best. It worked,
but it didn’t work great.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2274                     
==================================================

There are also squeezes that
just plain don’t work. This is
not common on weekly and
monthly charts, but it can be
a factor on intraday charts,
such as a five-minute chart,
or something a little longer,
like a 39-minute chart (I like
39-minute charts on
individual stocks, since the
chart shows 10 equal-sized
bars, as the cash stock
session has 390 minutes of
trading activity). What is the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2275                     
==================================================

best way to filter out the
potentially bad trades?
As I said earlier in the
chapter, it really is important
to know what is going on in
the larger time frames, even
if your trading plan doesn’t
have you actually trading
these time frames. Figure
11.30 shows a weekly chart
of the e-mini S&P 500
futures. This squeeze signal
fired off long at the end of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2276                     
==================================================

September, 2010, pushing
the index nearly straight up
for 300 plus points. The
move was ferocious, and
fighting this move proved
disastrous to many a trader’s
health.
In Figure 11.31, we drill
down to an hourly chart of
the e-mini S&P 500 futures
toward the end of November
2010, while the weekly chart
in Figure 11.30 remained in



==================================================
                    PAGE 2277                     
==================================================

the strong upward squeeze.
The trading process now
becomes extremely simple. Is
the hourly chart firing off a
short squeeze, in the opposite
direction of the weekly
chart? Like at point 1? Yes?
Pass on this trade. It’s a low-
probability trade that is
fighting the predominant
larger trend. On the other
hand, is the next squeeze that
is setting up firing off long?
In the direction of the weekly



==================================================
                    PAGE 2278                     
==================================================

squeeze? Like at points 2 and
3? Yes? Then take those
trades because they are great
signals aligned with the
weekly trend. This is why it’s
always important to
understand what the larger
time frames are doing. These
act as great filters for the
smaller time frames.

There is also another filter
that can be used. Figure
11.32 shows a 39-minute
chart of AAPL. At point 1, a
short squeeze fires off,
indicating that shorting
AAPL here would be a good
idea. AAPL does not sell off
and in fact starts to rally …
hard. Although the next
signal at point 2 did great,
that first signal at point 1

failed utterly. If we weren’t
looking at the larger times
frames such as a daily or
weekly chart, is there a way
to filter out these potentially
false signals?

Yes. At the bottom of the
chart is something called the
“TTM Wave C,” which
works as a directional filter.
The key is that if it is above
zero, as it is on this entire
chart, then you ignore short
squeezes. The opposite is
also true. If, on this chart, the
TTM Wave C were below
zero, then you would ignore
all long squeeze signals. This

Why Is It Critical to
Understand the Concept of
Anchor Charts?
I watched the squeeze for a
long time without any hard-
core filters. I felt comfortable
with the risk/reward ratio,
and I knew that not all
signals would work out. I did
notice, however, that there
were times, especially on
intraday charts, when the
squeeze wasn’t consistent.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2289                     
==================================================

And it didn’t seem random. It
happened in blocks of trades,
sometimes two or three in a
row before a really good one
fired off again. What was
going on? How could I
pinpoint the common
denominator? Looking at
“anchor charts” helped. This
is the process of looking at a
larger time frame and
referring to that larger time
frame before taking a trade
on a smaller time frame. For



==================================================
                    PAGE 2290                     
==================================================

example, if I’m using an
hourly chart as my anchor,
and it’s bearish and
everything is pointed lower,
why would I take a long
signal on a five-minute
chart? In this case, by
looking at the hourly
“anchor,” I can see that it
would be better to be patient
and wait for a short signal on
the five-minute chart, in the
direction of the larger
“anchor.”

Figure 12.1 shows two
charts. The one on the left is
an hourly chart of the ES,
while the one on the right is a
five-minute chart of the ES.
At point 1 on the hourly
chart, a squeeze fires off
short. During this signal, the
market goes into
consolidation mode at point
2. If we zoom in on this
consolidation on a five-
minute chart at point 3, we
can see that this action is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2292                     
==================================================

slightly bullish. And, look, a
squeeze is setting up …
maybe it is worth a shot on
the long side? Grab a couple
of ticks? During the heat of
the moment, that might seem
like a great idea. Why not try
to make a little extra money?

Figure 12.1
This rally failed miserably
starting on the next bar,
falling 50 ES points ($2,500
per contract) in rapid
succession. Looking at the
hourly chart, there was
clearly no reason to get long,
as the squeeze to the
downside was still unfolding.
Zoom in on that five-minute
chart, however, and it looked
as if a real rally was taking



==================================================
                    PAGE 2295                     
==================================================

shape. This is why anchor
charts are so important. They
keep the overall market
movement in perspective.
More important, they prevent
a trader from getting tied up
in a bad trade and then
completely missing the good
trade that was unfolding
before her eyes. That is one
of the main dangers of
hanging on to a losing trade
—it closes your eyes to all of
the wonderful opportunities



==================================================
                    PAGE 2296                     
==================================================

that are setting up around
you, as all your concentration
is diverted to watching the
disintegrating P&L on your
screen. As one of my former
trading mentors told me
numerous times, “Why dick
around with ticks when you
can tally up the points?”
Indeed. Some of the best
trades are the ones in which
we decide to pass.
Figure 12.2 shows the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2297                     
==================================================

same charts with the “TTM
Wave C” (I just call it the “C
wave” and will refer to it as
that throughout the rest of the
chapter) added to the bottom
of the chart. On the hourly
chart, we already know from
Figure 12.1 that the signals
are to the downside. The
added C wave reinforces this
by crossing below zero while
the squeeze is firing off
short. The downside of the
anchor chart is that there are



==================================================
                    PAGE 2298                     
==================================================

times when it is easy to
forget to refer to it, especially
if a trader is looking at many
markets, and especially in the
heat of the moment. This is
where the TTM Wave C
comes in handy. At point 2
on the five-minute chart, we
can see that the C wave is
clearly below zero. This
means, in essence, that the
longer-term trend on this
market, on this time frame, in
bearish. In other words, there



==================================================
                    PAGE 2299                     
==================================================

is no reason to get long. This
is known as “riding the
waves.”

Figure 12.2
What Exactly Are the
Waves, and How Do They
Work?
The waves were introduced
to me by a fellow trader,
Rodney Julian. I had spent a
few hours explaining to him
my concept of anchor charts,
and after I was through, he
just looked at me and said,
“John, this is a simple math



==================================================
                    PAGE 2302                     
==================================================

problem. You should just be
using these.” He showed me
“these,” which was a series
of indicators he had
developed over the last
decade. There are three of
them, which he calls waves.
They are as follows:
• Short-term trend: A
wave
• Medium-term trend: B
wave



==================================================
                    PAGE 2303                     
==================================================

• Long-term trend: C
wave
The waves essentially
measure various trends on
whatever market and
whatever time frame a trader
is observing. An A wave
measures the trend of the
prior six or so bars, the B
wave measures the trend of
the prior 15 or so bars, and
the C wave measures the
trend of the prior 30 or so



==================================================
                    PAGE 2304                     
==================================================

bars (this is my best guess, as
Rodney won’t tell me the
specifics).
Figure 12.3 shows a daily
chart of GS (Goldman Sachs)
with a C wave. Although
Rodney likes to watch the
ebbs and flows of the waves,
I really just focus on whether
they are above zero or below
zero, and how that all lines
up with the current squeeze.
At point 1, the C wave



==================================================
                    PAGE 2305                     
==================================================

starts to edge below zero.
This is a “heads-up” for me
that the uptrend in GS might
be coming to an end. When
the C wave goes fully below
zero at point 2, then the
longer-term trend on GS has
officially rolled over to the
downside.
Figure 12.4 goes one step
further and adds the A and B
waves to the chart, as well as
the squeeze. At point 1, a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2306                     
==================================================

squeeze fires off a short
signal. The A, B, and C
waves all cross below zero at
this time, which is a great
sign for the short side. The
squeeze, as is typical, runs
out of gas shortly after six
bars. It would be possible at
this point for a trader to take
his profit and move on to the
next trade. Another strategy
would be to take off half his
position, move his stop loss
to the entry point, and hold



==================================================
                    PAGE 2307                     
==================================================

on for as long as the C wave
(the bottom wave) is trading
below zero. This is, after all,
measuring the longer-term
trend of this market. Why
fight it?

Figure 12.4
Figure 12.5 shows a 39-
minute chart of BIDU. Point
1 represents what I call a
“Porsche setup,” as
everything has come together
for a nice trade. The squeeze
fires off long. The C wave is
well above zero, as is the B
wave. The A wave has
dipped below zero, but
immediately is back up
above zero. In other words,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2312                     
==================================================

the short-, medium-, and
longer-term trends on this
chart are all in alignment for
this signal. And the signal
works great, as BIDU kicks
off a 10 point plus move.

==================================================

Figure 12.5
At point 2, a one-dot
squeeze sets up to the short
side. Do we take this signal?
No. The C wave is still well
above zero, so there is no
point in fighting that longer-
term trend higher by trying to
make a quick buck on the
short side. Point 3 sets up a
squeeze, and this one has the
C wave above zero. Is it a
good signal? This is where



==================================================
                    PAGE 2315                     
==================================================

understanding the waves can
become very helpful. In this
instance, the A wave is
below zero and just can’t
cross above zero. This is a
flag that the short-term
momentum on this market
isn’t ready to move higher.
This squeeze fires off long,
and BIDU fizzles quickly.
Point 4 sets up another one-
dot short squeeze, which of
course we pass on because
the C save is clearly above



==================================================
                    PAGE 2316                     
==================================================

zero.
This chart is a great
example of having the
patience to wait for a setup
where “it all comes
together.” I also call these
Porsche setups. The
remaining three setups are all
Pintos. If you had a choice,
would you rather drive a
Porsche or a car that could
catch fire?
Figure 12.6 shows a two-



==================================================
                    PAGE 2317                     
==================================================

hour chart of the euro. Point
1 shows a squeeze that fires
off short. The A, B and C
waves are all in alignment.
Point 2 shows a squeeze that
fires off long. While the A
and B waves are in
agreement, the C wave is not.
The trade pops higher, but
the rally is short-lived. And
this is one of the biggest
benefits I’ve found with
using the waves. They tend
to distinguish signals that



==================================================
                    PAGE 2318                     
==================================================

will trend well from those
that are the quicker
countertrend moves. If I see a
squeeze like the one at point
2 and I decide to take it, then
I’m looking to get a
movement of 1 ATR
(average true range) and then
get the hell out. It’s a
countertrend trade. I know
this in advance. I won’t be
looking for a runner or a big
move. With point 1, on the
other hand, I’m looking for a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2319                     
==================================================

longer-lasting trend
movement, and I’ll know that
I can sit on my hands and let
the trade unfold.

Figure 12.6
How Can I Use the Waves
to Sneak into a Squeeze
Before It Fires Off?
What I’ve found in watching
the squeeze over the years is
that it is very consistent on
longer time frames, such as
daily, weekly, and monthly
charts, and that a trader
doesn’t really need the wave
filters on these longer time



==================================================
                    PAGE 2322                     
==================================================

frames. The filters are,
however, extremely helpful
and necessary for any
intraday trading on shorter
time frames where it is
critical to be on the right side
of the trend, right now. That
said, one of my favorite ways
to use the waves is to sneak
into squeezes on the bigger
time frames.
Figure 12.7 is a weekly
chart of the gold ETF, GLD.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2323                     
==================================================

This chart shows three clear
squeezes, and they all fire off
and push GLD nicely higher
with each signal. Prior to the
waves, I would patiently wait
for the squeeze to fire off,
and then duly pile in. With
the waves, I found that I
could sneak into the squeeze
before it actually fired off.
How so?
Once I see the first black
dots at points 1, 3 and 5, I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2324                     
==================================================

know that a squeeze is
setting up. I don’t know how
long it will take to unfold and
“fire off,” but I do know that
this market has entered that
special time of setting up for
a potentially large move. But
which way is it going to
move? Is the squeeze going
to fire off a long signal or a
short signal?
What I’ve found is the
following. If, at the time the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2325                     
==================================================

first black dot appears on the
squeeze (at points 1, 3, and
5), the saves are above zero
and trending higher, then this
squeeze has a 90 percent
chance of firing off long. The
opposite, of course, is also
true for a downside move.
Knowing this, when this
scenario sets up, I’ll start
scaling into these positions
early, and I will often have
built up a full position before



==================================================
                    PAGE 2326                     
==================================================

the squeeze even fires off.
For example, at point 5, I see
that a squeeze has started and
that the A, B, and C waves
are all trending higher.
(Note: it is important that the
B and C waves are also
above zero. The A wave can
be below zero, but it should
be trending higher.) I see that
this setup meets the criteria
for sneaking in early, and I
set about doing just that. At
the time for the first black



==================================================
                    PAGE 2327                     
==================================================

dot, GLD is trading at
$131.00. My goal is to build
up to a full position of 20 call
options on GLD. Note that if
the setup for sneaking in
early isn’t there, then I just
wait for the squeeze to fire
off as I normally would.

==================================================

Figure 12.7
The first black dot occurs
on February 4, 2011, at point
5. Since this is a weekly
chart, I realize that this play
could last for many months.
Therefore, I want to get
options that have a few
months still left before
expiration. In this case, I
look at the May calls, which
will expire on May 20, 2011,
the third Friday of the month.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2330                     
==================================================

As discussed in Chapter 5,
when it comes to options, I
prefer to buy them in the
money. In this case, I look at
the May 128 call options. I
buy one-fifth of my position,
or four contracts, at current
prices. At the end of the next
week, GLD has moved up to
$132, and I buy another four
contracts. The next week,
GLD pops higher, to $135,
and I pick up four more
contracts. The next week,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2331                     
==================================================

GLD pops again, up to $137,
and I buy four more
contracts. The next week,
GLD edges up toward $139,
and I pick up the rest of my
position. It is okay to buy
different option strike prices.
In this case, since GLD kept
moving higher, I also kept
buying slightly higher strike
prices, though they were all
in the money.
I’m now five dots into the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2332                     
==================================================

squeeze, and I have a full
position. GLD pulls back a
few dollars while the squeeze
continues to form, and it
eventually has eight dots,
meaning that this signal
developed over eight weeks.
When it does finally fire off,
GLD is near $139. My
average price is well below
this, and I’m locked and
loaded with a nice position.
GLD proceeds to rally to
$150 before it starts to lose



==================================================
                    PAGE 2333                     
==================================================

momentum, at which point I
take off half the position. But
because the C wave is still
trending higher, I decide to
hold on to the second half,
and I scale out as GLD
continues moving higher.
What is nice about this
entry method is it allows
scaling in and typically ends
up with a better average price
than if a trader had waited for
the squeeze to fire off. In this



==================================================
                    PAGE 2334                     
==================================================

case, by the time the squeeze
had fired off, GLD was
trading at $139, well above
the price level when the
squeeze first started to form.
I also utilize this strategy for
daily charts.
There are other ways to
use the waves, and Rodney
does like to watch the ebbs
and flows of the waves on
various time frames,
initiating trades when they

roll over. His strategy is a
little complicated to explain
in a book, and it would sound
better in his own words,
although he does tend to get
a tad esoteric. We’ve set up a

to give you Rodney’s
perspective on the waves as
well as additional examples
of how I use them.

Make You Money
This is going to be a short
and simple chapter, and we
are going to kick it off by
looking at Figure 13.1. This
shows two identical hourly
charts of GC, the gold futures
contract. The chart on the left
(Chart A) has regular
candlestick bars, while the
chart on the right (Chart B)
has TTM trend bars.
Otherwise, these two charts



==================================================
                    PAGE 2338                     
==================================================

are exactly the same,
showing exactly the same
price action over the three
days from August 14 through
August 17, 2011.
One of the biggest
problems I hear from traders
is, “How do I learn to hang
on to a winning position? I
always end up taking profits
way too fast. I just can’t help
myself, and nothing I do
seems to help.” The



==================================================
                    PAGE 2339                     
==================================================

temptation to take profits too
soon is great—remember, the
market lures us into thinking
that this is a good idea, when
in actuality it is one of the
main reason traders struggle
to make a consistent living
from the markets. This is,
simply put, a very bad habit.
So how does a trader hang on
to a winner?
A lot of traders I know
start their careers looking at



==================================================
                    PAGE 2340                     
==================================================

candlestick bars, which are
good for evaluating price
action. The only thing I don’t
like about them is that it is
easy, especially for newer
traders, to get too caught up
in the action on the current
bar. It is easy to get tunnel
vision and to place too much
importance on what is
happening “right now” as
opposed to looking at that
action in the context of the
prior six bars. One nasty-



==================================================
                    PAGE 2341                     
==================================================

looking bearish engulfing
candlestick is enough to
drive most traders out of a
long position, or vice versa
with a bullish engulfing
candlestick while they’re in a
short position. Those
candlesticks are nerve-
racking, to be sure. Yet many
times, the market continues
moving in the intended
direction shortly thereafter.
Worse, many traders then
“chase the market” in order



==================================================
                    PAGE 2342                     
==================================================

to reestablish their position,
since it is still moving. “Oh,
man,” they think. “It’s not
done!” And that is yet
another bad habit that will
prevent a person from being
able to do this for a living. It
truly is a vicious cycle. What
happened in this instance is
that a trader got “shaken out”
of a perfectly good trade
because she placed too much
emphasis on the action of a
single bar. This is the issue



==================================================
                    PAGE 2343                     
==================================================

that needs to be addressed.

Figure 13.1
I prefer to look at TTM
trend bars (similar to Heikin-
Ashi bars), which take the
action of the prior six bars
into account before rendering
a verdict of bullish or
bearish. This technique
literally takes in the average
price of the prior six bars. If
the average price of the prior
six bars is in the upper half
of that trading range, then it

pressure. However, if the
average price of the prior six
bars is in the lower half of
that trading range, then it will
paint the current bar red,
representing a bearish bias
and steady selling pressure.
On the right-hand chart
(Chart B) in Figure 13.1, this
“bullish blue” is shown as
light gray bars, and “bearish

red” is shown as black bars.
Let’s take a look. This is
where it all starts coming
together.
Figure 13.1 shows a
squeeze that fired off long.
As we learned in the squeeze
chapter, these moves are
considered to be over once
there is a loss of momentum,
which occurs at point 2. This
is a valid exit strategy.
However, I’ve noticed that



==================================================
                    PAGE 2348                     
==================================================

many times, a market will
keep moving higher after this
exit signal. What do I do? I
will take off half my position
at the loss of momentum at
point 2, and I will move my
stop to my entry point. I will
then wait for the TTM trend
bar to change color for two
bars in a row before I get out
of the rest of the position.

Shake Me Out of My
Position?
Figure 13.1 shows “nasty
candles” on the left-hand side
(Chart A) at points 3 and 4.
These look scary, as if real
selling is coming into the
market. It’s a sign to bail out,
right—to get out frantically
before the market can take
away any more of our profit?
Or … is it meant to be a
fake-out? After all, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2350                     
==================================================

market continues moving
nicely higher right after these
two “short and nasty” selling
sprees. To be blunt, it’s
meant to be a fake-out. It’s
meant to shake traders out of
their positions. Not that
anyone at Goldman Sachs
would try to shake us out of
our position so that he could
get back in at a cheaper price
…
How do we fight this?



==================================================
                    PAGE 2351                     
==================================================

Take a look at Chart B in
Figure 13.1. It’s the same
trade. The same points are
marked on the chart at 5 and
6. And yet what looked like
nasty selling candles on
Chart A show up as “merely
nothing” on Chart B. There is
no sell signal on Chart B.
Remember, since we are
long, we are looking for two
black bars (which, on a color
chart, would show up as red)
before we bail. These two



==================================================
                    PAGE 2352                     
==================================================

black bars would represent
real selling and a potential
trend change coming into this
market on this time frame.
On Chart B, there is no exit
signal. We are still long at
the top of the chart, with gold
trading at $1,795.00, while
many newbie candlestick
traders got shaken out at
points 3 and 4 on Chart A.
Trading is not meant to be
easy. It is meant to trick most



==================================================
                    PAGE 2353                     
==================================================

of the people most of the
time. No one is going to
make it easy for you to stay
in a position. Others will try
to scare you out so that they
can take your position from
you at a cheaper price.
Where do you think liquidity
and volume come from? If
you sell too soon and get
panicked out of a trade too
fast, well, that liquidity
comes from you. Whereas it
is easy to get faked out of a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2354                     
==================================================

trade by a scary candlestick,
a trader who takes the current
price action’s behavior into
consideration will be able to
withstand the small
countertrend shocks that are
meant to shake traders out of
their position.
Let’s take a look at
another trade. Figure 13.2
shows the devious ES
contract on a two-minute
chart. The ES is famous for



==================================================
                    PAGE 2355                     
==================================================

shaking traders out of their
positions right before they
make their next move. A
squeeze fires off at 8:30 a.m.,
allowing traders to get in on
the long side at 1171.00.
Prices grind higher for about
10 minutes, and then, wham,
prices get knocked down
from 1176.25 to 1172.75
quickly, as indicated by point
1 on Chart A. Many traders
would get knocked out here
on a trailing stop that they



==================================================
                    PAGE 2356                     
==================================================

are trailing too closely.
Others would see the nasty
candles and just get the hell
out, probably near the lows.
Did they still make money on
the trade? Yes, there is
nothing wrong with making
1.75 points (7 ticks) on the
ES, or $87.50 per contract.
But take a look at Chart B.
The nasty selling at point 2
never materialized into “two
black selling bars,” so there
was nothing to do here but



==================================================
                    PAGE 2357                     
==================================================

hold on to the position until
that event took place on the
chart. This eventually did
happen, about an hour and a
half later, at point 3. At this
point, a trader could get out
near 1182.50, a gain of 11.50
(46 ticks), or $575.00 per
contract. That is the
difference between getting
suckered into selling too
soon and staying in a trade
until it is truly over.

I utilize the TTM trend
bars for exit management. I
typically don’t use them for
entry signals, as I’d rather
wait for something like a
squeeze to get into a position,
or even use other entry
techniques discussed in this
book. I have found, however,
that this is one of the better
tools for managing exits.

Trend Without
Catching a Falling Knife or
Stepping in Front of a
Freight Train?
In watching the markets over
the years, I’ve observed that
most reversals take place
after three consecutive higher
closes or three consecutive
lower closes, and this
tendency is valid for all time
frames. The key to this setup
is that it is based on



==================================================
                    PAGE 2366                     
==================================================

consecutive closes and not
just on intraday or daily high
and low price action for an
individual price bar on a
chart. In other words, the
highs and lows are not
important. I’m not interested
in three higher price highs or
three lower price lows. I
want to see where the action
settles or closes, because that
is where the rubber meets the
road.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2367                     
==================================================

The hard way to follow
this play, especially intraday,
is to stare at the charts and
keep track of consecutive
lower or higher closes until
you get three in a row. This
can cause a person to go bug-
eyed, not to mention insane,
and is recommended only for
those who get a thrill from
“the little things in life.” I’m
not a big fan of staring at
charts, and I would be a
prime candidate for the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2368                     
==================================================

mental hospital if I did this
with the naked eye. Instead,
I’ve developed a simple
indicator that will “paint” the
first bar in the sequence after
the third bar has met the
criteria for a signal. Once I
see the painted bar, I just
place a market order, and I’m
in the trade. Even better, I set
up an audio alert so that if
I’m down the hall, I’ll hear
the signal and come back to
my computer to place the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2369                     
==================================================

trade. This works when I’m
on the phone with my wife as
well, although she has yet to
appreciate the importance of
the signal and my urgent
need to hang up in the middle
of our conversation. Such is
the life of a trader.
For the indicator, I did
add one key filter. I found
that at times I could get
shaken out of a play that was
consolidating (that is, a bull



==================================================
                    PAGE 2370                     
==================================================

flag) when prices made a
series of lower closes within
that consolidation. So, if
there are three lower closes,
but this price action does not
go below the signal bar’s
low, then I ignore the signal.
For this indicator on a long
signal, then, the trigger bar
would be the first bar that has
a higher low than the
previous bar. The next bar
that closes above the high of
this trigger bar paints this



==================================================
                    PAGE 2371                     
==================================================

previous low bar, which now
becomes the swing low
point. In most cases, all of
this happens with “three
higher closes,” but there are
times when it is not as clean,
and these instances are taken
into account with the one
confirmation that really
matters—price.
I use this signal in various
time frames. For scalping the
E-mini S&Ps, I like to use a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2372                     
==================================================

233-tick chart, because the
signals are very fast. On the
mini-sized Dow, I will use a
144-tick chart for scalping
and a five-minute chart to
catch the one or two
reversals that set up on any
given day. For swing trades,
I will use both 60-minute and
daily charts. I like to use this
primarily on the stock index
futures and the major
currency pairs, but it works
just the same in any market,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2373                     
==================================================

in any time frame. It is
simple, and it is based solely
on the price action. I will
also use this signal for
individual stocks that I am
following.
Why Are Tick Charts Best
for Scalping?
For tick charts (not to be
confused with the NYSE
$TICK play I discussed
earlier), I like to use



==================================================
                    PAGE 2374                     
==================================================

Fibonacci sequencing
numbers. If you Google that
phrase, it will bring up a list
of numbers that looks like
this: 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,
144, 233, 377, 610, 987,
1,597, 2,584, and 4,181 (and
so on). Of course, the list
keeps going, but we don’t
need them all. There is no
need to test the 144-tick chart
vs. the 143-tick chart to see
which is better. Why tick
charts? A 377-tick chart



==================================================
                    PAGE 2375                     
==================================================

forms a new bar every 377
trades. When the volume is
slow (especially in the
overnight session), this chart
crawls along. When the
volume and trading are fast
and furious, this chart will
develop at a much faster rate.
In sum, when the market is
slow, so is the chart. It’s not
pressured to form a new bar
every two minutes (as is the
case with a two-minute
chart), regardless of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2376                     
==================================================

volume, thus firing off false
signals when low-volume
conditions exist. When the
trading is fast, so are the
signals. Tick charts adapt to
the market, and I find them
especially useful for day
trading. How do we know
which tick chart to use?
There isn’t an exact science,
but the rule of thumb is this:
the higher the volume, the
higher the tick chart. While I
use a 987-tick chart for the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2377                     
==================================================

ES, I’ll use a 144-tick chart
for the YM. The only
difference is volume. As a
general rule of thumb, the
377-tick chart is good for
day-trading most
commodities, as well as
individual, high-volume
stocks.
Let’s quickly review what
a 233-tick chart is for anyone
who hasn’t used one before.
Remember, this type of chart



==================================================
                    PAGE 2378                     
==================================================

forms a new bar every time
there are 233 trades
executed. It doesn’t matter
what the size of any of the
trades is, just that 233 trades
have crossed the tape. I like
to use these charts when I’m
scalping for two reasons.
First, they are faster than
regular time charts when it
really matters—when the
trade frequency accelerates.
In comparison, a two-minute
chart is going to form a bar



==================================================
                    PAGE 2379                     
==================================================

every two minutes,
regardless of how fast or
slow the trading is. With a
tick chart, when the trade
frequency slows down, so do
the signals that are firing off
in this time frame; thus, these
charts naturally keep a trader
out of the market when there
is nothing going on. Second,
traders in the pit have no
concept of time with respect
to a two-minute or a five-
minute chart. They are



==================================================
                    PAGE 2380                     
==================================================

focusing on the actual
frequency of trades, and a
breakout on a two-minute
chart means nothing to them.
Although I prefer the 987-
tick chart on the ES for
intraday swing trades,
meaning trades that I could
be in for half an hour or
more, I will at times use the
233-tick chart for faster
scalping. A couple of
example plays with tick
charts are shown here.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2381                     
==================================================

What Are the Trading
Rules for Buys (Sells Are
Reversed)?
1. Set up a 24-hour chart
on intraday charts so
that the overnight
activity can be
accounted for in this
indicator setup. This
can be used in all
time frames. The
larger the time frame,
the larger the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2382                     
==================================================

parameters and the
potential move. For
daily charts, I will
use the regular
session hours.
2. After three
consecutive higher
closes, I go long at
the market at the
close of the third bar
in the sequence.
3. The trade is valid
until three



==================================================
                    PAGE 2383                     
==================================================

consecutive lower
closes occur, at
which point I exit the
trade. If the market is
still open for an
intraday trade, I will
simultaneously exit a
long and establish a
new short position. I
don’t use a stop loss
on this for intraday
chart trades because
the reversal signal is
my exit strategy,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2384                     
==================================================

whether it is a loss or
a gain. For daily
charts, I will place a
stop at the low of the
bar that caused the
signal to fire off,
which is the first of
three in the sequence
of closes.
4. If I’m in an intraday
trade (a 15-minute
chart or smaller) and
the market closes



==================================================
                    PAGE 2385                     
==================================================

before giving an exit
signal, I will exit at
the market at 4:10
p.m. eastern.
5. For time frames that
are 60 minutes or
longer, I will stay in
them overnight and
exit at the next signal.
This could be the
next day for a 60-
minute chart, and it
could be a month

next signal will not
show unless it is a

series of many higher

ignored because the

which is the close of
the third bar in the
series of lower lows
at point 4 on the

points, or $262 per
contract. It is
interesting to note
that during this trade,
all the oscillators
were measuring
overbought near the

1135.00 level, which
would have gotten
some traders out and
caused other traders
to start going short.
Using this setup, the
only thing that
matters is the price,

the only thing that
matters.

2.50. I don’t
recommend this. The
market action in the
stock index futures
after hours is slow
and irritating, and
there are many other
things I’d rather do
with my time. If you
want to trade actively
after 4:00 p.m.

the best liquidity and
opportunities are in

                    PAGE 2401

the currency markets.
I prefer the forex
cash markets in this
regard because there
is more liquidity in
the various currency
pairs during this post-
4:00 p.m. time frame.
When markets are
active and liquid,
they are tradable.
When they are quiet,
let them be.

E-mini S&P—December
2004 Contract, September
30, 2004
1. At 12:30 p.m. on
September 30, 2004,
I get a signal on the
60-minute ES chart,
indicating that a
reversal is in place
(see Figure 14.3).
The bar that is
painted is the 10:30
a.m. bar. Remember,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2403                     
==================================================

even though the
10:30 a.m. bar is
painted, the signal
didn’t actually fire
off until the close of
the third bar at 12:30
p.m. (the 10:30 bar is
the first bar, the
11:30 bar is the
second bar, and the
12:30 bar is the third
bar).

few days later, on
October 4.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2406                     
==================================================

4. I exit at 1136.50, for
a gain of 21.75 S&P
points, or $1,087.50
per contract. The 60-
minute chart is great
for catching swings
that last anywhere
from two to five
days. This is a great
setup for people who
are holding down a
full-time job and
don’t have time to
stare at the markets

this is a great setup
for people who are
day trading and are
currently losing
money. This 60-

discipline and
prevents a trader
from overtrading,
which is by far the
number one reason
why most traders fail
to make money in

1. On this daily chart of
the S&Ps, a signal

the June 24 daily bar
(see Figure 14.4).
(June 26 and 27 were
the weekend.)

of the third day,
which is what
triggered the signal.
I’m in the trade at
1132.50. I will now
stay in the trade until
I get a reversal signal.
For a stop, I use
1153.50, which is the
high of the June 24
bar. In my
experience, the actual
stop is rarely hit



==================================================
                    PAGE 2410

because a reversal
signal will fire off
before the markets
reach that level.

later, I get a reversal

July 28 at the close.
I’m out at 1096.00,
for a gain of 36.50
S&P points, or
$1,825 per contract.
Again, this setup is

                    PAGE 2413                     
==================================================

great for people who
are working and
don’t have time to
stare at the markets
all day. I also think it
is important for full-
time traders to have
two accounts, one for
day trading and one
for swing trading.
During a period when
a trader’s day trading
isn’t going well, it is
possible to catch a

I’m now waiting for

which is where I
place my stop.

on September 7,
nearly a month later.
4. I’m out at 10,278, for
a gain of 362 YM
points, or $1,810 per
contract. One of the
things I like about
these swing trades is
that they tend to take
care of themselves.
Compared to the
active and sometimes
frantic pace of

intraday trading, it’s
almost like buying a
rental property and
turning the
maintenance over to a
management
company. The type of
trading a person
chooses to do is
really a reflection of
her personality.
Someone who is
inherently a swing
trader will have a

tough time at day

KLAC (KLA-Tencor Corp.),
April 5, 2004
1. On this daily chart of
KLAC, a reversal
signal sets up on
April 5, 2004 (see
Figure 14.6).

this is a great setup to

Light, Sweet Crude Oil—
September 2004 Contract,
September 9, 2004
1. It is important to note
that this setup is
based purely on price
action, and therefore
works in all markets
(see Figure 14.7). On
September 9, 2004, a
reversal signal is
painted on crude oil.

long, as the market
reversed right away
and made three
higher closes. If you
are not familiar with
crude oil, a one-
dollar move is worth
$1,000 on the big
contract and $500 on
the mini-contract, so
a move of 5.90
equates to $5,900 per
contract on the big
contract (symbol =

contract on the mini-
contract (symbol =
QM). The quote feed
a person needs to get
live crude oil prices
is NYMEX. There is
an option for this in
eSignal and
TradeStation, and it’s
also available
through most of the
other robust quote
vendors.

Mini-Sized Dow—December
2004 Contract, October 6,
2004
1. I wanted to use this
example to show how
I flow into and out of
positions intraday,
going both long and
short (see Figure
14.8). This is best
done on lower-value
intraday charts, such
as five-minute charts



==================================================
                    PAGE 2430

on October 6, 2004,
in the YM is painted
at 10:35 a.m. eastern.

Figure 14.8
2. This means, of
course, that I am
going short at the
close of the last bar in
the sequence of three
bars, which is 10,176.
3. The next reversal is
noted on the chart at
point 3.
4. I cover at 10,169 and
simultaneously go



==================================================
                    PAGE 2433                     
==================================================

long. The easy way
to do this is to double
the number of
contracts you are
trading on your exit
order. So, if you are
long 10 contracts,
then you place an
order to sell 20
contracts in order to
exit your 10 long
contracts, and at the
same time establish a
new position that is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2434                     
==================================================

short 10 contracts.
5. The next signal
occurs at point 5.
6. I go long at 10,186
and simultaneously
go short at this same
level.
7. The next signal
occurs at point 7.
8. I cover my short at
10,173 and go long at
the same level.

==================================================

I’d like to share some
examples of this same setup
in the forex currency markets
and continue to add
commentary regarding the
trading of these instruments.
Let’s start with a market that
most traders are familiar
with, the euro currency as it
trades against the U.S. dollar.
Forex Markets—EURUSD,
October 15, 2004



==================================================
                    PAGE 2436                     
==================================================

1. On the daily chart of
EURUSD (see Figure
14.9), a long signal
fires off on October
15, 2004. I go long
near point 1 at
1.2469. Remember,
the stop is the lows of
the signal bar.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2437                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 2438                     
==================================================

Figure 14.9
2. The market has a
steady move higher
off this level, pausing
to consolidate for a
week in early
November. However,
there aren’t any
reversal signals given
during this time, so
there is nothing to do
but sit on my hands
and stay in the trade.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2439                     
==================================================

EURUSD resumes its
rally and shoots up
hard into the end of
December. At this
point, the market
rolls over, and many
people in this trade
start taking profits.
Again, however,
there are no sell
signals using this
setup. Finally, on
January 3, 2005,
nearly months



==================================================
                    PAGE 2440                     
==================================================

after the initial buy
signal, a sell signal is
generated at point 2. I
exit at 1.3467, for a
gain of 998 pips. At
$10 per pip, that is
$9,980 per individual
lot that is being
traded. For each lot, a
trader needs to have
$1,000 in his
account. This is part
of the large attraction
of the forex markets



==================================================
                    PAGE 2441                     
==================================================

—the ability to
establish specific
stops while using
leverage to ride out a
potential trend until it
turns. Forex traders
often talk in terms of
the dollar value of the
contract they are
trading: one lot
(contract) represents
$100,000 worth of
currency, 10 lots
represent $1,000,000



==================================================
                    PAGE 2442                     
==================================================

worth of currency,
and so on. Being long
10 lots is referred to
as having a “buck”
(that is, a dollar). If
I’m long 35 lots of
EURUSD and I need
to call my broker to
change my order, she
will refer to my
position as “
bucks.” Also,
catching 1 full cent,
or 100 pips, is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2443                     
==================================================

referred to as
catching “one large.”
So on this play, we
caught almost “10
large,” which is, of
course, a huge play.
In the interbank
market, which is
where all the
institutions and large
funds trade
currencies, the
smallest trade size is
$1,000,000, or the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2444                     
==================================================

equivalent of trading
10 lots through your
retail forex broker.
Forex Markets—GBPUSD,

1. On this daily chart of
GBPUSD (see Figure

I go short at 1.8837.

2. The next day, on
August 1, 2005, a
reversal signal is
given at point 2, and
we exit the play at
0.7604, for a gain of
44 pips. Remember,
any currency pair that
ends in “USD” is
worth $10 per pip, so
the gain on this trade
is $440 per lot being

==================================================

traded. The three
main currencies I
trade that end in
“USD” are the euro
(EURUSD), the
pound (GBPUSD),
and the Aussie
(AUDUSD). If a
currency ends in
“USD,” this means
that it will generally
move in the opposite
direction from the
U.S. dollar index. If



==================================================
                    PAGE 2455                     
==================================================

the dollar is moving
higher, then the euro,
the pound, and the
Aussie are selling off.
Of these three
currencies, the euro
and the pound are
most closely
correlated with the
dollar. The Australian
dollar is also tied
closely to commodity
prices, as Australia is
a huge exporter of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2456                     
==================================================

various commodities.
Because of this, the
Aussie at times
doesn’t move in
direct correlation
with the U.S. dollar.
Let’s take a look at
the other main
currency pairs.

2. A few days later, on
July 24, a reversal
signal is given at
point 2, and we exit
at 1.2971, for a gain
of 116 pips. Since
this currency pair
does not end in
“USD,” the valuation
of the pip will be
slightly different
from that in the

previous examples.
When this play was
taken, the value of a
pip was around $7.
So, in this case, 116
pips equates to a gain
of $812 per lot being
traded. This currency,
the Swiss franc,
trades very closely
with the U.S. dollar.
If the dollar is going
higher, so is the
Swissy.

get three lower closes
in a row, and the
signal fires off at

currency cross, each
pip is worth about
$18, which makes the
payout on this play
$1,044 per lot. This is
actually a very quiet
currency pair, but

when it does move, it
is very steady, and it
tends to act like
nothing can stand in
its way. Because of
this trait, we have
nicknamed this
currency pair “the
tank.”
Summing Up the Scalper
Alerts
Scalper alerts are especially



==================================================
                    PAGE 2479                     
==================================================

useful for traders who like to
try to buy bottoms or short
tops. While it is foolish to
short a market just because
it’s “too high” or buy a
market because it’s “too
low,” it’s fine to short that
high flyer or buy that all-out
loser once you get a reversal
confirmation with this signal.
It doesn’t mean that the dead
highs or the dead lows are in
place, but it does mean that
there has been a temporary

                    PAGE 2480                     
==================================================

shift in power, and it is a
valid signal to step in and
establish a position. Whether
this is an intraday reversal on
a five-minute chart or a total
market reversal off a daily
chart, the concept is exactly
the same. In addition, this
play is based on pure price
action, and I appreciate its
simple and effective nature.

Figure 14.18
Increase the Probabilities of
Success Through
Multisetup Combinations
One theme that a trader will
find in my setups is that they
all work well together. When
I’m scalping (which is
admittedly less frequent the
older I get), I particularly like
to combine the pivots with
the scalper alerts on a 233-

tick chart for the ES and a
144-tick chart for the YM.
On days when I’m not sure
what the market is going to
do, I can wait for a scalper
confirmation against a pivot
level, as this is a trade that
has a very high probability of
success. Even better, I will
get into a pivot trade, and
shortly thereafter I will get a
scalper confirmation in the
direction of the trade. I can
also use the scalper sell



==================================================
                    PAGE 2484                     
==================================================

reversal to get out of my long
pivot trade. I talk about this
more in the chapter on
developing a business plan,
but the idea is to find what
makes sense to you and your
personality and mix and
match accordingly.

Brick Plays:
How Can I Tell
When a Market Is
Going
to Reverse Its Trend
in the
Middle of the Day?

==================================================

Using Bricks to Capture
Intraday Reversals in the
Mini-Sized Dow
The best intraday trades take
place when a trader is able to
catch the major portion of an
intraday reversal. One of the
best ways to do this is with a
specific price pattern that we
call bricks. We call them
bricks because the price
pattern that is formed looks
like a bunch of building



==================================================
                    PAGE 2487                     
==================================================

blocks that have been placed
on top of a regular bar chart.
These building blocks are
formed on the chart because
of specific price action. A
series of three consecutive
higher closes will form an
“up” brick, and a series of
three consecutive lower
closes will form a “down”
brick.
If you have a hard time
pulling the trigger, this is a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2488                     
==================================================

good play to use with buy
stop and sell stop orders, as
you will see in a moment. If
you don’t have a hard time
pulling the trigger, then you
can just wait for the signal
and go in at the market. This
is one of those plays that are
difficult to explain, but easy
to show. In this case, a
picture is worth at least 1,000
words, if not more, so let’s
go through the trading rules
and then go over a couple of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2489                     
==================================================

actual plays.
Trading Rules for Buys
(Sells Are Reversed)
This is a momentum reversal
confirmation play.
1. Set up a 24-hour time
frame on an intraday
chart so that the
overnight activity can
be accounted for in
this indicator setup.
This is best used on



==================================================
                    PAGE 2490                     
==================================================

smaller time frames,
typically less than
five minutes,
although it can also
be used for swing
plays on daily charts.
2. Once a market shifts
direction, which is
denoted by the bricks
changing color, count
backward to the third
brick in the
formation.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2491                     
==================================================

3. Then draw a
horizontal line across
the top of this third
brick back.
4. Once the price action
breaks above this
horizontal line, go
long.
5. Hubert Senters
(cofounder of
www.tradethemarkets.com
and I use this setup
on the mini-sized



==================================================
                    PAGE 2492                     
==================================================

Dow, and we each
manage this trade
differently, so I will
go over both of our
methods. Hubert
places a 10-point stop
from the entry. Then
when he is up 10
points, he sells half
his position and
moves his stop to
breakeven – 3. (So if
his entry was 10,545,
then his new stop is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2493                     
==================================================

10,542.) If the market
goes up another 10
points, he sells a
quarter of his
position and then
moves up his stop 6
points to breakeven +
3. (So if his original
entry was 10,545, his
new stop is 10,548.)
He then hangs on to
the last quarter of the
position to exit at his
discretion. This



==================================================
                    PAGE 2494                     
==================================================

typically means that
he will hold on to this
last part of his
position until the
bricks signal an
opposing sell signal.
6. I will get into the
same trade and use a
20-point stop. I will
exit half my position
at +15 points and
then stay in the trade
until there is a brick



==================================================
                    PAGE 2495                     
==================================================

that has formed in the
opposite direction—
an opposing sell
signal. I don’t trail
the stops. Both
methods have worked
well for us, and this
is a good example of
how different traders
can take the same
setup and modify the
trading methodology
to fit their own
particular personality.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2496                     
==================================================

Let’s take a look at some
actual plays.
Mini-Sized Dow—March
2005 Contract, February 25,
2005
1. On this five-minute
chart of the minisized
Dow futures on
February 25, 2005, a
long signal occurs at
around 10:00 a.m.
eastern (see Figure



==================================================
                    PAGE 2497                     
==================================================

15.1). This takes
place when the price
action reverses and
crosses above the
horizontal line
created by the third
brick back in the
series. The first brick
in the series is the
black brick labeled as
point 1, the second is
that labeled as point
2, and the third is that
labeled as point 3.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2498                     
==================================================

The entry price is
10,696. This
horizontal line is
drawn in manually.
Originally it started
on the brick above
where the line is
currently drawn at
point 3. This
horizontal line was
sitting near 10,710.
However, as the
market continued to
push lower,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2499                     
==================================================

additional down
bricks were formed,
and the horizontal
line was trailed three
bricks back
accordingly. This
line, representing the
entry point for a long,
continues to be
trailed down as long
as new down bricks
are being formed. It
is only when the
markets can cross



==================================================
                    PAGE 2500                     
==================================================

back above the third
brick back in the
series that a trade
signal occurs. On a
color chart, the up
bricks are blue, and
the down bricks are
red. On these charts,
the up bricks are light
gray and the down
bricks are black.

==================================================

Figure 15.1
2. In this instance, once
the trade is entered,
the YM rallies to
almost 10,790 before
rolling over. A
reversal signal is
generated shortly
thereafter at point 4
at a price of 10,778,
for a total move of 82
points.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2503                     
==================================================

I want to also discuss
three different ways in which
this setup could be played.
The first and most
straightforward way would
be to stay in the entire trade
from entry to exit, capturing
the entire move. In this type
of play, I start off with a 20-
point stop and then stay in
the trade until the reversal
signal occurs. The downside
of this is that the market
could rally 18 points, then



==================================================
                    PAGE 2504                     
==================================================

roll over and stop out the
trade.
Another way to play this
is to exit half the position at a
purely mechanical price
target. This is how Hubert
and I play this. We each
execute this trade slightly
differently, and the
mechanics of each of our
styles will be explained
shortly. By exiting half of
your position at my or



==================================================
                    PAGE 2505                     
==================================================

Hubert’s predetermined
mechanical levels for the first
half of the trade, some profits
will already have been taken.
This can mean the difference
between a losing trade and a
scratch trade. So the second
way to play this is to start off
with a 20-point stop, exit the
first half of the position at a
mechanical level, such as 15
points, and then exit the
second half upon a reversal.
This is typically how I play



==================================================
                    PAGE 2506                     
==================================================

the bricks.
The third way to play this
is the way Hubert plays it,
where he uses a 10-point stop
and then starts peeling out of
the position almost
immediately. In this case, he
sold half of his position when
he was up 10 points, sold
another quarter when he was
up 20 points, and held on to
the rest until the reversal.
Note that these exit strategies



==================================================
                    PAGE 2507                     
==================================================

can be used on all the
intraday plays discussed in
this book.

==================================================

Figure 15.2
These are all valid exit
methodologies for this setup.
It is important for a trader to
recognize that every setup
can be played in different
ways and to find the way that
best suits her own
personality. For the rest of
the examples, I focus on the
actual reversal points as
entries and exits.

Mini-Sized Dow—March
2005 Contract, March 3,
2005
1. On this three-minute
chart of the mini-

reversal signal fires
right around 1:00
p.m. eastern, as the
third brick back in

entry on a buy stop
order is 10,817.
2. For the exit, we are
now waiting for a
down (black) brick to
form, and once that
happens, we will use
a trailing three-brick
stop utilizing the up
bricks. By doing this,
we exit the trade at
10,871, for a gain of

is to wait for an up

about this is that the
setup keeps a person

noise and false rallies
that occur between
1:00 p.m. and 3:00

How many traders
got chopped up in
this? How many

How many shorts
panicked and
covered? A trader
who follows a

huge advantage over
all the people out
there who are “trying

2005
1. On this two-minute
chart of the YM on
March 22, 2005, the
YM fires off a short
signal late in the
trading day, and a sell
stop order is hit at
10,622 (see Figure

2. The markets drift
lower into the close,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2529                     
==================================================

and there actually is
not a reversal signal
given to exit this
trade. In this case, we
just use the 4:15 p.m.
eastern close on the
ES to get out of the
trade. Although the
YM continues to
trade until 5:00 p.m.,
the liquidity really
dries up after the ES
market closes. In this
case, exiting on the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2530                     
==================================================

close generates an
exit at 10,469 for a
gain of 153 points.
Why the big sell-off?
This was FOMC
(Federal Open
Market Committee)
day, and the markets
sold off after the
news hit about
another quarter-point
rate increase. This
ties into one of my
biggest beliefs about



==================================================
                    PAGE 2531                     
==================================================

trading the markets—
economic reports
mean very little in the
overall scheme of
things. The market is
going to do what the
market is going to do.
The key is to focus
on the setup and
ignore the rest of the
noise.

people think about
the market and what
they feel it might do.
What matters is what
the market is actually
doing. Trade setups
like the bricks
remove all the
emotion.
Summing Up the Bricks
The brick setup is great when



==================================================
                    PAGE 2537                     
==================================================

you’re trying to catch an
intraday reversal. Too many
traders try to do this, but end
up getting burned. They short
the market, but it just keeps
going higher. Or they buy the
market, and it gets flattened.
There is no reason to try to
catch the exact high or the
exact low in a market move.
That involves too much risk
and has a low probability of
success. With this
confirmation signal, a trader



==================================================
                    PAGE 2538                     
==================================================

will be made aware of when
the move has petered out and
started its reversal, and
although she won’t be able to
catch the exact highs or the
exact lows, she will still be
able to catch the “meat of the
move.”
We’ve set up
www.tradethemarkets.com/
bricks with free videos that
update this play for current
market conditions.

The Ping-Pong Play:
Batting the Markets
Back and
Forth … All Day
Long
A Trading Channel That
Moves and Adapts to the
Markets in Real Time



==================================================
                    PAGE 2540                     
==================================================

The Ping-Pong play is a
channel play with a twist:
this channel is always present
and is continually adjusting
itself to the market action.
There isn’t any need to draw
a couple of parallel lines and
wait for two tests of the highs
and two tests of the lows to
confirm that a channel is in
place. This channel is always
hanging around, waiting for a
trade to set up.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2541                     
==================================================

This setup was discovered
by accident by Hubert
Senters, my business partner
and friend for going on more
than 10 years now. He spent
a couple of years watching
KLAC (KLA-Tencor Corp.)
on a two-minute chart and a
five-minute chart. He noticed
that when KLAC broke up
through the 200-period
simple moving average
(SMA) on a two-minute
chart, it would head right up



==================================================
                    PAGE 2542                     
==================================================

to the 200-period SMA on a
five-minute chart. To make
life easier, he eventually
figured out that he could do
this all on one chart by
setting up a new two-minute
chart that had both a 200-
period SMA and a 500-
period SMA. The 500-period
SMA on a two-minute chart
plots just the same way as a
200-period SMA on a five-
minute chart. Once this play
was converted to one chart, it



==================================================
                    PAGE 2543                     
==================================================

was easy to see that a live,
moving channel was in place,
as the 200-period SMA and
the 500-period SMA moved
together in an almost
graceful dance.
Hubert uses this setup
almost exclusively on the
stock KLAC. We’ve also
found that it works well for
other high-volatility, high-
volume stocks that tend to
attract a lot of the day-



==================================================
                    PAGE 2544                     
==================================================

trading crowd; examples
include GOOG, PCLN,
AAPL, AMZN, and others of
that type. Although the
examples in this chapter
focus on KLAC, they apply
equally to these other stocks
as well. For the higher-priced
stocks, stop prices are
calculated at 50 cents per
$50. So with a stock like
AMZN trading at $200, a
stop of $2.00 would need to
be utilized. Let’s take a look.

Trading Rules for Buys
(Sells Are Reversed)
The Ping-Pong play can be
both a momentum play and a
fade play, depending on the
initial move against one of
the moving averages. When
prices are trading inside the
channel, this is a fade play.
When prices break into the
channel, this turns into a
momentum play.
1. I set up a two-minute



==================================================
                    PAGE 2546                     
==================================================

chart on a 24-hour
time setting. I want
the pre- and
postmarket activity to
be taken into account
for the moving
average calculations.
2. I like to use
candlestick price
charts on this play,
but this is not critical
because I’m not
looking for any



==================================================
                    PAGE 2547                     
==================================================

specific candlestick
patterns, such as
dojis, hammers,
shooting stars, and so
forth. If you are
unfamiliar with
candlestick patterns,
an excellent book is
Japanese Candlestick
Charting, by Steve
Nison. I personally
don’t use candlestick
patterns for intraday
trading, but I do like



==================================================
                    PAGE 2548                     
==================================================

to see what the daily
candlestick bars are
doing to get a better
feel of who is in
control of the market
—buyers or sellers.
3. I place a 200-period
SMA (represented by
the thick line in the
chart examples) and a
500-period SMA
(represented by the
thin line in the chart



==================================================
                    PAGE 2549                     
==================================================

examples) on the
two-minute chart.
4. When the market is
trading below both
moving averages, I
go long after the first
two-minute bar
closes inside the
moving average
channel.
5. When the market is
trading inside the
moving averages, I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2550                     
==================================================

go long on a bounce
off the bottom of the
channel. I will wait
for a two-minute bar
to close on a bounce
off the channel before
placing a market
order to go long.
6. I use a 50-cent stop.
If the moving
averages are trading
wider than 50 cents,
then when I am up 50



==================================================
                    PAGE 2551                     
==================================================

cents on the trade, I
will move my stop to
the moving average
that triggered my
entry. If the moving
averages are trading
narrower than 50
cents, then I will
leave my original
stop in place, and I
won’t trail it.
7. My target is the
“other moving

                    PAGE 2552

average.”

trade on KLAC, as
does Hubert.
However, it works
with other volatile
stocks as well.

Figure 12.1). After
the first closing
candlestick, I go
short at the market
and am filled at
43.83. I place a 50-
cent stop at 44.33,
and my target is the
500-period SMA
below. About 45
minutes later, I am up
50 cents on the trade,
so I move my stop



==================================================
                    PAGE 2554                     
==================================================

down to the 200-
period SMA, which
is trading at 43.91.

comes within 10
cents of my stop. It
eventually rolls over
and hits my target at

I am out of the trade
for a gain of 72 cents.
KLAC is liquid and
will support a large
number of shares on
this trade. For 1,000



==================================================
                    PAGE 2557                     
==================================================

shares, that is a profit
of $720; for 10,000
shares, that is a gain
of $7,200. There will
be a little slippage
when going into and
out of 10,000 shares
at the market. When
this happens, I just
take the average
price, and I use that
to determine where I
will place my 50-cent
stop. I will also trade



==================================================
                    PAGE 2558                     
==================================================

KLAC single-stock
futures on this trade
(KLAC1C). For
those of you who
aren’t familiar with
single-stock futures,
they are nice because
the leverage is 5 to 1
without any margin
interest costs. And
these can be traded in
an IRA through a
trust account
(meaning that you



==================================================
                    PAGE 2559                     
==================================================

can short them in
your IRA), and you
can do these day
trades with only a
few thousand dollars
in your account,
instead of the
$25,000 minimum
you need to day-trade
stocks. One single-
stock futures (SSF)
contract represents
100 shares of stock.
With single-stock



==================================================
                    PAGE 2560                     
==================================================

futures, I will use
limit orders instead of
market orders
because they are not
as liquid as the
underlying stock.
However, the low
volume that is
currently present in
SSFs is misleading.
The liquidity is based
more on the volume
of the underlying
stock. This is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2561                     
==================================================

something that I talk
more about later in
Chapter 22,
“Propulsion Plays,”
using the 8/21 EMAs
for entries and trade
management. My
experience with
single-stock futures
has been very
positive, and I
continue to add more
of these contracts to
my trading program.

Figure 16.3). When
the first bar closes
back below this

short at the market.
I’m filled at 38.24,

stop at 38.74. The
moving averages are
less than 50 cents
apart, so I won’t be
trailing my stop on

When You’re Dancing with

Idea to Let It Lead
One of the things I like about

ebbs and flows of the market
nicely. All I have to do is sit
back and “let the market
lead.” There really isn’t any
good time to try to force the
market to do what you want

reminder of that, and all I
have to do is sit back, relax,
and follow my dance partner.

The 3:52 Play:
Capping Off the Day
with a Fine Cigar
This Is Where the Other
People Start to Panic
The 3:52 play is a setup I
discovered while working in
a trading room observing



==================================================
                    PAGE 2611                     
==================================================

more than 100 other traders
going through their daily
gyrations with the market. It
is commonly known among
traders that 3:30 p.m. eastern
is a key reversal point in the
markets. What was
fascinating was that I would
watch this room full of
traders stare at the bounce (or
sell-off) that would start at
3:30, and then they would
wait, wait, and wait some
more. They would wait for



==================================================
                    PAGE 2612                     
==================================================

confirmation, wait for an
indicator-based buy or sell
signal, wait for their mother
to call and tell them it was
okay to take the trade, or
whatever. The point is that
they would wait to jump in
on the move. Finally, they
would succumb to the
pressure to get in, and they
would jump in on the move
just as it was running out of
steam. I would spend the rest
of the session watching in



==================================================
                    PAGE 2613                     
==================================================

fascination as they pointed,
gyrated, and yelled at their
computer screens as the
markets drifted against them.
Often they would wait until
the last possible minute to
get out of their S&P futures
trades, which is 4:15 p.m.
eastern. They would wait in
the hope that the markets
would come back to them,
and they spent this brief
session praying that their
position would work out.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2614                     
==================================================

Sometimes it did, but often it
did not because there were
too many of them who were
trapped and hoping for the
same move. As the markets
neared 4:15 p.m., they had no
choice. They could not wait
any longer, and they were
forced to close out their
positions. Like rats on a
sinking ship, these traders
would all head for the exits at
once. If they were long, they
would all be selling at once.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2615                     
==================================================

If they were short, they
would all be buying at once.
The interesting part of this
is that the liquidity dries up
after 4:00 p.m. eastern. With
the decreased liquidity that
exists from 4:00 p.m. to 4:15
p.m., these groups of traders
can easily cause exaggerated
movements in the markets in
the final minutes before the
closing bell. This causes the
markets to move hard against



==================================================
                    PAGE 2616                     
==================================================

them. I watched them do this
day after day, assuming that
one day they would catch on.
They never did, and after a
while I would just sit there
and do the opposite of what
they were doing, so that
while they were crying, I was
cashing in. This same setup
continues to work today, and
it is something that I do
nearly every trading day.
Like a single-malt Scotch
after a filet mignon, it’s a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2617                     
==================================================

great way to cap off a trading
session.
Trading Rules for Buys
(Sells Are Reversed)
This is a fade play. I let the
3:30 p.m. eastern reversal
happen, and then 22 minutes
later, at 3:52, I take the
opposite side of the move.
1. I use this setup for the
E-mini S&Ps and the
mini-sized Dow

futures.
2. I set up a one-minute
bar chart without any
other indicators or
interference.
3. At 3:30 p.m. eastern,
I mark where the
futures are trading. In
the case of this
example, the futures
would have started
rallying at 3:30 p.m.
eastern.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2619                     
==================================================

4. At 3:52 p.m., I take a
short using a market
order. I short at the
opening of the 3:52
one-minute bar. This
is assuming that the
ES is at least 1 point
away and that the
YM is at least 10
points away from
where it was trading
at 3:30. On days
when this does not
occur, I don’t take the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2620                     
==================================================

trade.
5. My stop for the ES is
2 points, and my stop
for the YM is 20
points. I do not trail
stops for this play.
6. I hold on to the trade
until 4:13 p.m.
eastern, at which
point I close out at
the market.
Technically I could
hold on until 4:15,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2621                     
==================================================

but I don’t want to
get stuck in this trade
overnight, which is
why I give it two
minutes of elbow
room. If I discover
that my PC has
locked up, that gives
me enough time to
call my broker and
get out of my trade. (I
use a broker who
actually answers the
phone and doesn’t

                    PAGE 2622                     
==================================================

put me on hold.)
7. Even though the
mini-sized Dow
doesn’t close until
5:00 p.m., I still use
4:13 p.m. to mirror
the E-mini S&P
futures markets. By
4:15, I’m ready to
take a break from
trading for the day.

are rallying off of

looking to short this

watching a one-

==================================================
                    PAGE 2624                     
==================================================

that the 3:51 p.m. bar
closes at 1104.75.
Then at 3:52 p.m.,
the bar opens at
1104.50, and I take
the opposite side of
this move. I short at
the market, and I am
filled at 1104.50. I
place a two-point
stop at 1106.50.

2. The traders who
jumped on this 3:30

or just dumping their

the market down
even further. At 4:13
p.m., the one-minute
bar opens at 1103.00.
This is my time
signal to get out, and
I cover at the market
for a gain of 1.50 E-
mini S&P points.
One of the things I
like about this play is
that there is a time
limit. I know that



==================================================
                    PAGE 2628                     
==================================================

when I get in, I will
be getting out 21
minutes later. I also
like the fact that I’m
not looking for a big
move. I’m mentally
prepped to take a
small scalp, and
when this trade does
move against me, it is
typically for a very
small loss, since my
actual stop is rarely
hit.

opposite side of this
move, so I go long.
All I am waiting for
now is 3:52 p.m.,
which is my time
trigger to get into the
trade. At 3:52 p.m., I
buy at 1136.00 and
place a stop at
1134.00. Why do I
wait for exactly 3:52
p.m. to fade this
move? This is just the
time I settled on after

==================================================

doing this on a trial-
and-error basis for a
long period of time. I
cannot
mathematically prove
that getting in at 3:52
is better than getting
in at 3:50. It’s almost
like asking whether
people prefer blondes
or brunettes. They
may have a
preference, but in the
end all that matters is

less than that in the

movements in this

sometimes get a little

positive for this trade
setup. On September

using a market order,
and I’m filled at
10,309 (see Figure

good example
because the market

==================================================

then be shorting this
rally into 3:52 p.m.?
No! The key element
to look for is the
predominant move
after 3:30 p.m.
Remember our
friends in the trading
room? They see the
move off 3:30 p.m.,
and then they wait,
wait, wait to get in.
So in this example,
they are shorting the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2652                     
==================================================

dead lows of the
move, and they will
spend the rest of the
session covering their
shorts for a loss. My
basic rule of thumb
on this trade is as
follows: if it is not
crystal clear, then I
just don’t take the
trade. For example, if
the market is dead
quiet into the final
hour of trading and



==================================================
                    PAGE 2653                     
==================================================

there isn’t any
reaction at 3:30 p.m.,
then I don’t have a
trade to take. Either
this setup is very
obvious, or there isn’t
a setup. There is
usually a clear setup
four days out of five.

Summing Up the 3:52 Play
I like this trade because it is
simple and effective, and it
clearly goes against the
masses who chase this move



==================================================
                    PAGE 2685                     
==================================================

off the 3:30 p.m. reversal
time frame. Like it or not,
futures trading is a zero-sum
game. For someone to win,
someone else has to lose.
This trade clearly takes
advantage of traders’
emotions and cleanly
separates the winners from
the losers.
Have there been any
updates to this chapter since
it first came out? This



==================================================
                    PAGE 2686                     
==================================================

chapter is one that is near and
dear to my heart, as this
setup really hits on the reality
of trading— and that is that
to make money trading, you
have to take it from someone
else. This setup clearly lays
out who is getting her money
taken away from her and
why. There is no use denying
this. As traders, we aren’t
saints. We are just pitting our
skills in the arena against
those of the other gladiators.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2687                     
==================================================

I have had to make a few
modifications to this setup
since this book was first
released. I refer to this now
in my daily newsletter videos
as the “end-of-day play,” and
while the theory is still the
same, there are a few tweaks
that take internals into
account. Why the tweaks? In
reality, this is the one setup
that I should not have had
published in book form. It’s a
low-volume setup, and when



==================================================
                    PAGE 2688                     
==================================================

too many people dive into a
low-volume setup, it dilutes
the effectiveness of that
setup. The other setups in
this book aren’t like that.
They all occur in markets
and time frames that can
handle lots of volume. This
particular setup, however,
takes advantage of low
volume to panic traders out
of their positions. It’s truly a
beautiful thing. Even when I
find myself on the losing end



==================================================
                    PAGE 2689                     
==================================================

of a trade like this, I still
appreciate its simplicity. One
person’s gain is another
person’s pain.
I’ve set up a series of free
videos at
www.tradethemarkets.com/352
that shows the updates I’ve
been utilizing for this
particular play.

Measuring the Length of
the Move Before It Occurs
The one thing I can say for
certain about the markets is
that they will never move
straight up or straight down
forever. A market can
definitely rip higher for a
long time, but at some point
it will have to rest and
consolidate, and sometimes it
will even come back down to
earth and reverse all those



==================================================
                    PAGE 2692                     
==================================================

spectacular gains. Just as a
runner can sprint for only a
limited amount of time
before his body gives out, a
market can move only so far
before it needs to pause, take
a rest, and build up its energy
reserves for the next major
move.
Box plays are used to
discover situations in which a
market is taking a break
before getting ready for its



==================================================
                    PAGE 2693                     
==================================================

next major thrust, whether it
is the next spurt higher or the
next spurt lower. My favorite
markets in which to use this
play are the currency
markets. These plays work
well on both the currency
futures and the cash forex
markets.
The most popular
currency to trade is the euro.
This is not to be confused
with the Eurodollar contract

that trades on the CME,
symbol ED. Eurodollars are
U.S. dollars on deposit in
commercial banks outside of
the United States.
Eurodollars are an interest-
rate product that portfolio
managers can use to hedge
short-term interest-rate risk
with all kinds of complicated
strategies. This is the most
liquid contract in the world,
but it doesn’t move, and I
don’t trade it. To clarify, I’m

                    PAGE 2695

talking about the euro/dollar
currency cross, which is the
actual currency I get in my
hands when I go to Europe
and exchange my U.S.
dollars for euros. On the
CME, this is called Euro FX,
symbol EC. In the forex
markets, it is called the
euro/dollar cross, symbol
EURUSD.
To review, on the CME
and in the forex markets, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2696                     
==================================================

euro moves in increments of
1/100 of a cent. On the CME,
this move is called a tick, and
it is worth $12.50 per
contract, making a full 1-cent
move worth $1,250 per
contract. In the forex
markets, this move is called a
pip (price interest point), and
it is worth $10, making a full
1-cent move worth $1,000
per contract. There are also a
mini-forex and a micro-
futures contract available, in



==================================================
                    PAGE 2697                     
==================================================

which each pip is worth $1,
and a full 1-cent move here
would be worth $125. It is
important to keep in mind,
however, that there are many
other trading opportunities
out there in the currency
world besides the euro. Often
the other currency pairs
move and trend better for the
simple reason that there are
not a lot of retail traders
jumping into and out of these
other markets. Trades in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2698                     
==================================================

euro make up only about 10
percent of my currency
trading.
There are arguments on
both sides concerning which
market is better for
currencies—futures or the
cash forex markets. With the
futures, the spreads are a
little tighter, and the
commission is the same as
trading regular futures
contracts, but there are no



==================================================
                    PAGE 2699                     
==================================================

guaranteed fills, and slippage
can be a real issue. With
forex, the spreads are a little
wider, fills are guaranteed in
all but extreme market
conditions, and the
advertising says there aren’t
any commissions to pay.
Really? This works out as
follows: if a trader buys one
contract on the CME, she
will pay roughly $5 in
commission plus the $12.50
spread, for a total outlay of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2700                     
==================================================

$17.50. In forex, a trader will
pay a 3-pip spread at $30 and
no commission. The
difference between the two in
this case is $12.50, meaning
that you can save $12.50 per
contact by trading futures.
This does add up. I am a
redundancy freak, so I am set
up to trade both. If for some
reason I have a problem with
the futures contract, then I
can hedge my position in the
forex market. In general,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2701                     
==================================================

however, I like to keep my
stock index futures trades
separate from my currency
trades. By having separate
accounts, I can easily
measure my performance in
trading these various
markets. One area where I
utilize the forex cash market
is in the exotic crosses, such
as the EURJPY, GBPJPY,
and so on. All of these
currencies trade very
technically, and the more



==================================================
                    PAGE 2702                     
==================================================

charts that a trader has
available to watch, the more
opportunities that will set up.
Overall, I continue to favor
the futures markets for
trading futures, as it is a
regulated entity. However,
being able to trade the exotic
crosses as well as trade in
various position sizes (micos,
minis) with liquidity is a nice
feature of the cash market.
Okay, back to the box



==================================================
                    PAGE 2703                     
==================================================

play. I’m looking for a period
of horizontal consolidation
with at least two tests of the
highs and two tests of the
lows. Once I get these two
tests, then I’m looking to buy
a breakout of the box or sell
a breakdown of the box. My
target on these trades is the
width of the box. These plays
can be done on all time
frames. An individual who is
primarily a day trader can
execute this setup utilizing 1-



==================================================
                    PAGE 2704                     
==================================================

, 2-, 3-, 5-, and even 15-
minute charts. An individual
who also likes to swing trade
can look for these setups on
the 60-minute, 120-minute,
240-minute, and daily charts.
I trade these as both swing
and intraday plays, with each
time frame being
independent of the other time
frames. This means that I
could have a 60-minute box
play going on with one set of
parameters, and a 5-minute



==================================================
                    PAGE 2705                     
==================================================

box play going on with a
totally different set of
parameters. Also, since the
forex markets actively trade
24 hours, these box plays can
be set up at any time. It is
important to remember that
there are multiple major
openings each day. Tokyo,
London, Australia, New
York— and other markets—
all open around 8:00 a.m. in
their local time. There isn’t a
bell or anything that rings.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2706                     
==================================================

Traders waltz into their
offices, and when they get to
their desks, they start placing
orders for their clients.
Because of this, these
consolidation patterns tend to
break quickly, and once they
do, they tend to trend really
well.
I like to try to get some
sleep each night, but on those
nights when I get shafted by
the wait staff (that is, I order



==================================================
                    PAGE 2707                     
==================================================

decaf coffee after dinner, but
they give me caffeinated, so I
end up lying in bed staring at
the ceiling), I can at least get
up and check whether a box
play is forming overnight.
Although I will look for box
plays throughout the trading
day, I also like to scan
through the charts before I go
to bed. If there are any box
plays setting up, I will place
my orders, hit the sack, and
see how my trades worked



==================================================
                    PAGE 2708                     
==================================================

out in the morning. This
works out great—my friends
joke with me because I can’t
sleep very well unless I have
a position on.
Trading Rules for Buys
(Sells Are Reversed)
Box plays are momentum
plays. I will buy a breakout
and short a breakdown.
1. I like to set up a
simple bar chart on



==================================================
                    PAGE 2709                     
==================================================

the time frame I want
to play. I will search
through various time
frames to see where
box plays are
currently setting up.
For this example, I
use a 15-minute
chart.
2. As the market action
progresses, I take a
horizontal line and
start marking highs



==================================================
                    PAGE 2710                     
==================================================

and lows. I usually
have to adjust this
horizontal line a few
times as the market
action develops.
Once I get two tests
of one of the lines, I
have a potential box
play developing.
3. At this point, I am
watching to see if I
get another test on
the opposite side of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2711                     
==================================================

the box. Let’s assume
in this example that I
do, and that I now
have two tests of the
highs and two tests of
the lows. The width
of the box is 20 ticks.
Now, a trader isn’t
going to know that a
box is in place until
the prices hold the
fourth test and move
back into the center
of the box. Once



==================================================
                    PAGE 2712                     
==================================================

prices have moved
back up into the box
by about 25 percent,
my box is complete.
For example, if the
width of the box is 20
ticks, then I would
want to see prices
move back into the
box by at least 5 pips
after the fourth price
test.
4. Now that I have my



==================================================
                    PAGE 2713                     
==================================================

box, I place two
orders. I place a buy
stop order one tick
above the high end of
the box, and I place a
sell stop order one
tick below the low
end of the box.
Whichever way the
market breaks, I am
sitting there with my
order waiting to get
filled.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2714                     
==================================================

5. My buy stop is hit.
For my stop, I just
leave my sell stop in
place, as this now
becomes my stop loss
order on this trade.
This represents a
risk/reward ratio of a
little over 1:1.
6. I stay in my play until
my stop or my target
is hit. I do not trail
stops.

Euro FX—December 2004
Contract, October 5, 2004
1. This is a 15-minute
chart of the euro
currency futures
contract that trades
on the CME (see
Figure 18.1). On
October 5, 2004,
there is a high point
marked at 1.2319. I
draw a horizontal line
over this level to see



==================================================
                    PAGE 2716                     
==================================================

if this will hold and
become the top of a
new box.

Figure 18.1
2. A few hours later, the
markets make a low
and bounce, and this
is where I draw the
horizontal line for the
bottom of the
channel. Now that I
have my first high
and low, I need
secondary tests of
both these levels in
order to have a box.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2719                     
==================================================

3. About five hours
later, a test of the
upper end of the
range occurs.
4. And about two hours
after that, another
downward test
occurs. I now have a
box, and I can set up
my orders. I place a
buy stop order one
tick above the high of
the box. The high of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2720                     
==================================================

the box is 1.2319, so
I place my order at
1.2320. The low end
of the box is at
1.2306, so I place a
sell stop order at
1.2305. It is
important to note that
boxes do not always
set up in a “picture
perfect” way. In this
chart, there is a
wayward tick at point
4 that pushes through



==================================================
                    PAGE 2721                     
==================================================

the horizontal line.
I’m more concerned
about the two levels
that were tested,
which is why I keep
the line of the first
test at point 2. The
basic rule of thumb
for boxes is this: if
you have to sit back
and wonder whether
there really is a box
on the chart, then
there isn’t a box on



==================================================
                    PAGE 2722                     
==================================================

the chart. Once boxes
form, they are very
obvious. It is not
critical that you
include the wayward
ticks in your box if
they are only a few
ticks away. This is a
trade in which a few
ticks usually won’t
make or break the
trade.
5. At point 5, my sell



==================================================
                    PAGE 2723                     
==================================================

stop is hit, and I’m
now short at 1.2305.
My target is the
width of the box.
Since the width of the
box is 13 ticks, I
subtract 0.0013 from
1.2305, and I get
1.2292. I place a limit
buy at this level to
cover my position. I
leave my original buy
stop in at 1.2320, as
this will be my stop.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2724                     
==================================================

Note that even
though I am getting
into the trade a little
“outside the box,” I
still use the exact
width of the box as
my target.
6. My target is hit at
1.2292, and I’m out
for a gain of 13 ticks,
or a gain of $162.50
per contract.

2. The market sells off
for six hours and
bottoms out. I draw a

of the lows.

the upper end of the

of 1.2305 before
turning back and
heading lower.

we now have a box.
Let’s look at Figure

placed my orders.

1. As prices continue to
fluctuate, I move my
horizontal line up to
1.2310, which is the
new top of the box.
Could I have left this
at 1.2305? Yes.
Remember, when it
comes to wayward
ticks that are a few

ticks away, it
generally does not
have any impact on
the trade. I place a
buy stop order 1 tick
above this level at
1.2311 at point 5. I
also place a sell stop
order 1 tick below the
low of the box, at
1.2275. I note that
this box is 34 ticks
wide, so my target
will be 34 ticks,

whether I’m taken
into the market long
or short. Later, it
turns out that my buy
stop is hit. I place a
limit sell order for
my target 34 ticks
above my entry,
which is 1.2345. My
stop is my original
sell stop order at
1.2275.
2. My target is hit, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 2735                     
==================================================

I’m out for 34 ticks, a
gain of $425 per
contract. If you aren’t
using OCO (order
cancels order) orders,
be sure to remember
to cancel your open
sell stop order at
1.2275. If you don’t,
you will be leaving a
live order in the
market, and if this
level is hit, you will
get filled with an

1. This is a 15-minute
chart of the euro
currency on the forex
market (see Figure
18.4). The reason it
says “EURUSD” is
that this is the
indication that this is
the euro as it is
trading in relation to
the U.S. dollar, as
opposed to the euro
as it is trading against
the pound, the yen, or

some other currency.
By now this drill
should be familiar.
We get two tests of
the highs and two
tests of the lows, and
we get our box via
the levels marked 1,
2, 3, and 4 in Figure
14.4. I adjust my
lines so that the high
of the box and the
low of the box are
represented, and I

2. This box stays in
place for a long time.
It’s a relatively tight
box at 24 pips.
Typically, the longer
the box is in place,
the more energy it is
building up, and the
more forceful the
move will be when it
eventually breaks.

3. At 7:30 a.m. eastern,
the market breaks the
box and hits the buy
stop, labeled point 5.
I’m filled, and the
target is hit shortly
thereafter, for a gain
of 24 pips, or $240
per contract. This
particular move
keeps right on going.
Some traders I work
with will take half
their position off

is hit, and then trail
the other half. This
all comes back to
formulating a
business plan that
best fits a trader’s
personality—
something that I talk
about in great detail
at the end of the
book. For me, the
box play is a high-
probability play in

stick with the original
stops I have laid out
in this chapter.
However, I will scale
out of multiple-lot

are going my way,
and I’ll show an
example of that at the
end of this chapter.

happens, I place my
orders. I use a buy
stop at 1.1933 and a
sell stop at 1.1619.
5. My sell stop is hit at
1.1619 at point 5.
Since the width of the
box is 312 pips, I
calculate my target
accordingly, and I
place a buy limit



==================================================
                    PAGE 2749                     
==================================================

order at 1.1307. My
stop is my original
buy stop order at
1.1933.
6. The market moves
down nicely and then
shoots back higher.
Anyone who was
using a trailing stop
for this trade would
have been stopped
out for a small gain.
The reason I keep my

                    PAGE 2750                     
==================================================

stop wider, and the
reason I do not trail
it, is that I know that
this is a high-
probability play, and
I want to give this
setup “room to
move” in order to
give it a chance to
work out. My target
is hit nearly two
weeks later for a gain
of 312 pips, just over
three large in trader

Forex Markets—EURUSD,
August 3, 2004
1. On August 3, 2004,
the euro forms a box
on the 15-minute
charts (see Figure
18.6). The first high
is marked here at
point 1.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2752                     
==================================================

==================================================

Figure 18.6
2. A few hours later, we
get a potential low
for the box, and I
draw a horizontal line
at the lows here.
3. The market bounces,
and we get a retest of
the highs.
4. Then the euro sells
off nicely, and we get
a retest of the lows.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2754                     
==================================================

Since this low pushed
a little lower than the
low at point 2, I go
ahead and move my
horizontal line down
to reflect this low.
Once I have these
lines set up, I place
my orders. I use a
buy stop at 1.2062 (1
pip above the highs)
and a sell stop at
1.2042 (1 pip below
the lows).



==================================================
                    PAGE 2755                     
==================================================

5. My sell stop is hit at
1.2042. Since the
width of the box is 18
pips, I calculate my
target, and I place a
limit buy order at
1.2024. My stop is
my original buy stop
order at 1.2062.
6. My target is hit, and
I’m out for a gain of
18 pips, or $180 per
contract. I don’t have



==================================================
                    PAGE 2756                     
==================================================

to remember to
cancel my open buy
stop because my
execution software
does it for me
automatically.
Forex Markets—EURUSD,
August 19, 2004
1. On this 15-minute
chart of the
EURUSD, we get a
first test of the highs



==================================================
                    PAGE 2757                     
==================================================

at 1.2347 (see Figure
18.7). Once the
market sells off from
this level, I draw a
horizontal line across
the high.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2758

==================================================

Figure 18.7
2. The market sells off
and pushes as low as
1.2323. I start off
drawing a line at this
level. Later I move
this line back up to
1.2331 because the
rest of the price
support tests are
much closer to this
level than the
“wayward tick.”



==================================================
                    PAGE 2760                     
==================================================

3. Here we get another
test near the highs.
4. And here we get
another test near the
lows. Once the four
price tests are
complete, I place a
buy stop order at
1.2348 and a sell stop
order at 1.2330.
Although this box
isn’t perfect, there is
no doubt that we



==================================================
                    PAGE 2761                     
==================================================

have a nice horizontal
channel in place.
5. My buy stop order is
hit. Since the width
of the box is 16 pips,
I place a sell limit
order for my target at
1.2364. My sell stop
remains in place as
my stop on this play.
6. My target is hit, and
I’m out for 16 pips, a
gain of $160 per



==================================================
                    PAGE 2762                     
==================================================

contract. as you can
see, I could have also
used the low of the
“wayward tick” in
my calculations, and
this would have been
a more profitable
trade. The bottom
line is that when it
comes down to a few
ticks, where you
place your horizontal
line is not a big deal,
as long as it is crystal



==================================================
                    PAGE 2763                     
==================================================

clear that a box is in
place. This applies to
nearly all setups. If
you have a setup, and
you miss the trade
because you were
trying to get the
perfect entry, then
you are the chump
that just got played
by the market. Good
setups take time to
develop and
shouldn’t be



==================================================
                    PAGE 2764                     
==================================================

squandered.
Generally, traders
who miss their
“perfect entry”
usually end up
chasing the markets
as prices run away
from them. Afraid of
missing the move,
they frantically jump
on board.
Unfortunately, this
action shifts them
into the group of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2765                     
==================================================

traders who just
bought the top or sold
the bottom. What was
a great setup
suddenly turns into a
losing trade. As with
most of the scenarios
in this book, I’m
speaking directly
from the painful and
frustrating
experiences all newer
traders have. This
particular scenario is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2766                     
==================================================

where the following
often-quoted trader
saying comes into
play: don’t be a dick
for a tick. I keep this
somewhat crude
phrase handy so that
when I see a setup, I
just get into the trade
and don’t try to
finesse my entry.
Entries are a dime a
dozen. It’s the exits
that make you

money.
Forex Markets—AUDUSD,
May 30, 2005
1. On this 120-minute
chart of AUDUSD,
we get a first test of
the highs at 0.7638
(see Figure 18.8).
Once the market sells
off from this level, I
draw a horizontal line
across the high.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2768                     
==================================================

==================================================

Figure 18.8
2. The market sells off
and pushes as low as
0.7584. I start off
drawing a line at this
level. The market
bounces and retests
this level again
before moving
higher.
3. At point 3, we get
another test of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2770                     
==================================================

highs, pushing up a
little bit above the
previous highs.
4. Once this high is
tested, the markets
stair-step their way
back to the lows at
point 4. After the four
price tests are
complete, and prices
rally about 25 percent
back into the box (the
width of the box is 54



==================================================
                    PAGE 2771                     
==================================================

pips, so 25 percent of
this is about 14 pips),
I place a buy stop
order at 0.7639 and a
sell stop order at
0.7583. Prices rally
almost all the way to
the top of the channel
before rolling over
and heading lower.
Finally, on May 30,
2005, my sell stop is
hit. It is important to
remember that I had



==================================================
                    PAGE 2772                     
==================================================

to wait patiently for
this setup to execute.
After I placed my
buy and sell stops, I
had to wait 44 hours
before one of them
was hit.
5. After my sell stop is
hit, my original buy
stop becomes my
stop loss on this
trade. My target is the
width of the box,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2773                     
==================================================

which is 54 pips
away at 0.7530. The
markets move
quickly down to this
level, but don’t quite
make it. Then they
bounce all the way
back to my entry,
pause, and then
reverse back lower,
plunging violently
into my buy limit
order. I’m out for 54
pips, a gain of $540



==================================================
                    PAGE 2774                     
==================================================

per lot being traded. I
want to emphasize
again how important
it is to be patient in
trading and waiting
for the right setup.
This trade took 76
hours to set up. Then,
once I placed my
orders, it took
another 44 hours for
one of them to be hit.
And after I was filled,
it took another 34



==================================================
                    PAGE 2775                     
==================================================

hours for my target to
get hit. This one trade
spanned 154 hours.
In trading, patience is
a virtue, and
impatience triggers
devastation.
Forex Markets—EURGBP,
April 12, 2005
1. On this 120-minute
chart of EURGBP,
we get a first test of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2776                     
==================================================

the highs at 0.6867
(see Figure 18.9).
Once the market sells
off from this level, I
draw a horizontal line
across the high.



==================================================

==================================================

Figure 18.9
2. The market sells off
and prints a low of
0.6848 before
bouncing higher. I
draw another line
beneath this level.
3. Prices firm and rally
back up to the highs.
Once this level tests
and prices roll over, I
wait to see if a retest



==================================================
                    PAGE 2779                     
==================================================

of the lows will hold.
4. And we get another
test near the lows.
Once the four price
tests are complete, I
wait to see if the
markets can rally at
least 25 percent back
into the box. Since
the width of the box
is 19 pips, 25 percent
would be about 5
pips. Once this



==================================================
                    PAGE 2780                     
==================================================

happens, I place a
buy stop order at
0.6868 and a sell stop
order at 0.6847. This
box is pretty clean.
5. Prices come back up
to retest the highs,
sell off to the middle
of the box, come
back up yet again to
test the highs, and
then finally roll over
and go through the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2781                     
==================================================

lows, filling my sell
stop order. My buy
stop order stays in
place as my stop.
EURGBP sells off
quickly, and my
target is hit on the
second bar at point 5.
(Of course, quickly is
a relative term, as
these are 120-minute
bars.) This currency
pair is worth around
$18 a pip, so the 19-

Prices quickly fall
from this level, and I

Once prices start to

place a horizontal
line across the lows.
3. Prices shoot up and
retest the highs at
point 3.
4. This is quickly
followed by another

                    PAGE 2786                     
==================================================

test of the lows at
point 4. Once prices
rally about 25 percent
back up into the box,
I place my orders,
with a buy stop at
1.2578 and a sell stop
at 1.2518. After
retesting the lows yet
again, prices firm 20
hours later and bust
out through the highs,
triggering my buy
stop order. My sell



==================================================
                    PAGE 2787                     
==================================================

stop remains in place
as my stop loss on
the trade. Prices plow
forward, and it
doesn’t take long for
my target to get hit.
The gain is good for
58 pips, or roughly
$464 per lot.

lows, and we now
have the fourth test of
the box in place.
Once prices rally
back 25 percent into
the box, I place my
orders, a buy stop at

at 139.65.
5. Prices rally to just
beneath my buy stop,
then roll over and
trigger my sell stop.

chart of GBPJPY, we
get a first test of the

2. The market rallies
and stays in the upper
part of its range for a
long time. We test the
highs three times
before selling off to
test the lows again.
Even though we test
the highs three times,
this counts as only
test 2 of the box. For
this upper part of the

range to become an
official part of the
box, it has to be
offset with another
corresponding test of
the lows. (For
example, three tests
of the highs and one
test of the lows do
not make a box.) I
keep my line across
the highs at 199.24
and wait to see if we
will get another test



==================================================

finally sells off and
retests the lows.
4. It doesn’t take long
for the market to rally
back up and test the
highs of the box at
point 4, and once
prices fall back to

Ringing the Cash Register—
Scaling Out of a Position as
It Goes Your Way
My style within a strategy is
to get into the trade all at
once and then scale out as the
trade goes my way. My goal
is to still have one-third to
one-half of my position left if



==================================================
                    PAGE 2805                     
==================================================

and when the strategy hits
my target. This is one big
advantage of trading multiple
lots. With one lot, I would
just stay in the trade from
start to finish. With multiple
lots, a trader can start peeling
off contracts so that if the
trade does reverse and gets
stopped out, the overall loss
will be offset by any gains
already booked, thus
increasing the trader’s
risk/reward ratio. On this

==================================================

particular play, my buy stop
order was for 75 lots. Once
the markets triggered my buy

the way up to my target (see
Figure 18.14). This snapshot
of my execution platform
shows that I sold 25 lots at

138.05, and the final 25 lots
at 138.07, for a total gain on
the play of $14,957.62.
Because I literally executed

make the deadline for this
chapter, it put into
perspective how much
writing a book really is a
labor of love, albeit painful.
This is my first book, but I’m
guessing that my year of toil
in trying to fill hundreds of
blank pages with semiuseful
material will probably net me
about the same amount as
this two-hour trade. (I’m sure
there is a lesson in there
somewhere.)

Summing Up the Currency
Box Play
I always enjoy the act of
giving presents and opening
them over the holidays. I find
that I enjoy that feeling



==================================================
                    PAGE 2810                     
==================================================

almost as much as
discovering a new “box” to
open up in the currency
markets. With this play,
Christmas seems to happen a
few times each week instead
of just once a year.
In parting, I can’t
emphasize enough how
important it is for traders to
find a market that fits their
own personality if they hope
to be successful. If you find



==================================================
                    PAGE 2811                     
==================================================

that you are happy only if
you are buying breakouts and
selling breakdowns, then the
currencies are probably your
market of choice. Currencies
break and trend well, while
the E-mini S&Ps tend to suck
in traders with false
breakouts and breakdowns.
In other words, if you are
buying breakouts in the
S&Ps and getting killed, then
give the currencies a try. I
particularly like to combine



==================================================
                    PAGE 2812                     
==================================================

the box play and the squeeze
play on the hourly charts for
all of the major currencies,
especially on the overnight
session. I call this the “life is
like a box of chocolates”
play because when you wake
up in the morning, you never
know what you are going to
get. This particular trade
setup has controlled risk and
open targets, so it’s possible
to really catch big moves
during the overnight action.

Because It’s Expensive Is
Dangerous—Unless It’s
Done Like This
When it comes to the
financial markets, the bottom
line is that the current action
is going to be determined by
one thing and one thing only:
the price that people are
willing to pay right now. A
stochastic can be overbought,
a MACD (moving average
convergence divergence) can



==================================================
                    PAGE 2816                     
==================================================

be rolling over as a potential
short, and moving averages
can be violated to the
extreme. Whatever the
indicator, it doesn’t mean
that price action is going to
reverse. There is a high
probability, to be sure, but
that doesn’t mean that it’s
going to happen. On the
contrary, in these cases of
extreme overbought or
oversold readings, prices can
still keep trending higher or



==================================================
                    PAGE 2817                     
==================================================

lower for a long, long time.
In 1999, overbought stayed
overbought for months and
months. In 2000 and 2001,
oversold stayed oversold
almost continuously. During
the 2008 financial crisis,
some stocks (like Lehman
Brothers) got so oversold that
they disappeared. Everyone
who screamed, “It’s a
bargain” on the way down
learned the meaning of pain
many times over.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2818                     
==================================================

I hear stories nearly every
day from people who bought
a stock “because it looked
cheap,” only to have it
continue to crater on a daily
basis. Some of these stocks,
like EXDS (Exodus
Communications, Inc.) and
WCOM (WorldCom, Inc.),
got real cheap, real fast.
Eventually, the people who
bought these stocks on the
way down either got
frustrated and couldn’t take



==================================================
                    PAGE 2819                     
==================================================

the pain anymore, so they
sold, or, in many instances,
they got out using one of the
best tried-and-true sell
signals on the planet—the
company declared
bankruptcy, and the stock
went to zero. The opposite is
also true, in that I’ve heard
plenty of war stories about
traders shorting a stock
“because it looked too high.”
They were soon experiencing
shell shock as the stock



==================================================
                    PAGE 2820                     
==================================================

continued to race higher and
destroy their account.
Speaking of shorting, I
always find it amusing that
brokers talk about how
dangerous shorting a stock is,
because the potential losses
are “infinite.” Well, I have
yet to see a stock rise to
infinity, but I’ve seen plenty
of stocks go to zero. Never
mind the fact that brokers
and trading firms make a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2821                     
==================================================

huge living shorting stock to
the public.
In trading, it is never a
good idea to try to catch a
falling knife (buy a steep
sell-off) or step in front of a
freight train (short a frantic
rally) just because prices
“look too low” or “look too
high.” How, then, does a
trader catch a reversal
without risking life and limb?
That is where this setup



==================================================
                    PAGE 2822                     
==================================================

comes into play. This method
for catching market tops and
bottoms is based on the one
solitary thing that matters
most in trading: price.
Trading Rules for Sells
(Buys Are Reversed)
This is a reversal play. I
will short tops and buy
bottoms only upon
confirmation of this setup. I
generally use this for swing
plays, but it is valid on all



==================================================
                    PAGE 2823                     
==================================================

time frames, including
smaller time frames for
intraday plays. HOLP and
LOHP are acronyms for
“high of the low period” and
“low of the high period.” We
pronounce them “HOPE”
and “LOPE.”
1. Identify a trending
market, or an
individual stock, that
is ideally making new
20-day (or period)



==================================================
                    PAGE 2824                     
==================================================

highs. This is a rule
of thumb; markets
that are making only
17- or 18-day (or
period) highs are also
fine. The point is that
you want to see a
definitive trend and
be ready to step in
when that trend
reverses.
2. Identify the high bar
in the uptrend. This is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2825                     
==================================================

typically the current
bar, but it could be a
few bars back. By
“high bar,” I mean
the bar with the
highest intraday price
prints in the entire
move higher.
3. Once I identify the
high bar, I will then
go short once price
action closes below
the low of this high



==================================================
                    PAGE 2826                     
==================================================

bar. (Say that really
fast three times.)
4. The initial stop is the
high of the high bar.
If I am still in the
trade on the third day,
or period, I will start
to use a two-bar
trailing stop. I will
exit this trade when
the current bar closes
above the price level
represented by the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2827                     
==================================================

two-bar trailing stop.
5. Because of
retracement price
patterns while in a
play, the two-bar
trailing stop will
sometimes have to be
held on the current
“stop bar” until the
trend resumes. Once
the trend resumes, the
two-bar trailing stop
can also be resumed.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2828                     
==================================================

This doesn’t happen
very often, and I
realize that it makes
no sense while
reading this text.
Don’t worry, it is not
subject to
interpretation, and it
will become clear
when you see a
specific example. I
will focus
specifically on this in
Figure 19.13.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2829                     
==================================================

This setup works in all
markets, in all time frames. I
usually use this play on
individual stocks and their
corresponding stock options,
stock index futures, and the
forex currencies on the 60-
minute and daily charts.
E-mini S&P—December

==================================================

example of the entry
method. This
particular chart is a
daily representation
of the E-mini S&P
futures. Once I’ve
gone over this entry
method, we will jump
into the exit strategy.
It is important to
understand how to
enter this trade. The
white bar labeled
point 1 represents the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2831                     
==================================================

“high bar” in the
uptrend. The low of
this high bar is
1133.50. The high of
this bar represents the
highest prices seen in
at least 20 days. In
fact, the last time the
S&Ps were at this
price level was back
on July 1, 2004.

Figure 19.1
2. Since the black bar
labeled point 2 broke
the low of the high
day, we enter this
position at the close

is 1131.50. This trade
does not have an exit
at the time this
snapshot was taken
because an exit signal
has not fired off. I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2834                     
==================================================

usually get a few
questions here when I
discuss this trade.
The first is, “Can I
enter the trade
intraday as soon as it
breaks the low of the
high day instead of
waiting for the
close?” My answer to
this is that you can,
but I really want to
see a close to show
that the market means



==================================================
                    PAGE 2835                     
==================================================

business. Often I
would take this trade
intraday, only to have
it close back up
above the low of the
high day, which
invalidates the trade.
By waiting for the
close, you are getting
extra insurance that
this reversal is valid.
The other question I
get usually has to do
with entry points and



==================================================
                    PAGE 2836                     
==================================================

knowing which bar is
actually going to be
the high bar. Of
course, you don’t
know which bar is
going to be the high
bar that kicks off the
reversal until the
price break actually
occurs. Is it going to
be this bar? Or are we
going to get another,
higher bar first? All
you can do is



==================================================
                    PAGE 2837                     
==================================================

continue to watch the
new bars develop.
When I identify a
high bar, I keep an
eye out to see
whether price action
closes below the low
of that high bar. If the
next bar goes even
higher, then this new,
higher bar becomes
the high bar. In
essence, I’m trailing
an imaginary sell stop



==================================================
                    PAGE 2838                     
==================================================

order. As prices
advance higher, so
will my entry until
we finally get a break
of the low of the high
bar. Although this is
a simple concept, I
have found that it
takes a few examples
for people who are
new to this setup to
get the hang of it.
That said, let’s look
at some more

point 1 takes place at
the end of the
September, marking
the lows of this
particular move,
which aren’t quite
20-day lows, but they
are 18-day lows,
which is fine. I want
to buy a close above
the high of the low
day. The high on this
day registered at
1112.50.

seven days. In the bar
labeled 3, the S&Ps
close below the low

get out at 1132.25,
for a gain of 17.00

high day (see Figure
19.8). The entry on
the short side is
1.3553.
2. The market continues
to drop lower for five
days in a row before
bottoming out. On
January 12, the stop
is triggered, and we
are out at 1.3254 for
a gain of 299 pips, or
$2,990 per lot.

3. On February 4, the
EURUSD makes new
nearly 20-day lows
and is now a
candidate for this
setup. The entry
signal fires off on
February 9 with a
close above the high
of the low day. The
entry is taken at
1.2803.

==================================================

broke the high of the
low day, we enter this
position at the close
of this day at 45.00.
3. On September 28, we
exit at the close of
bar 3 at 56.42. This is
one of those trades
where, in hindsight, it
would have been
“genius” to exit at the
intraday break of the
two-bar trailing stop.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2874                     
==================================================

That exit would have
been around $70.
However, I have
done this play both
ways, and I’ve found
that the intraday stop
will frequently get a
trader out of a
position that still has
a lot of room to
move. In any event
we still netted nearly
12 points on this
trade.

nearly 14 points. On
this play, we got
stopped out just
before the stock
rocketed higher
another 30 points in
just three trading
days. This goes back
to being a “genius in
hindsight.”
Forex Markets—EURGBP,
June 16, 2005



==================================================
                    PAGE 2880                     
==================================================

1. I like this particular
example because it
demonstrates how
important it is for a
trader to stick to his
setups. On June 16,
the EURGBP makes
new lows, and the
next day prices
reverse and close
above the high of this
low day, firing off a
long signal (see
Figure 19.12).



==================================================
                    PAGE 2881                     
==================================================

2. I go long, and a group
of other traders I
work with also goes
long. Our entry was
0.6709.
3. EURGBP rolls over
and closes below our
two-bar trailing stop.
Our exit is 0.6632, at
point 3 on June 23,
for a loss of 77 pips.
This bar also marks a
fresh low and



==================================================
                    PAGE 2882                     
==================================================

becomes the new
signal bar in this
setup.
4. On June 29, at point
4, we get another
close above the high
of the low day, and I
take the entry at
0.6680. Other forex
traders I work with
pass on this setup,
having felt the sting
of the first loss.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2883                     
==================================================

5. EURGBP rallies
nicely, and the two-
bar trailing stop gets
hit on July 13 at point
5, at 0.6851, for a
gain of 171 pips. The
point of this example
is to show the
importance of not
filtering out a
particular setup
because of how you
feel about it. If the
previous setup was a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2884                     
==================================================

loss, many newer
traders will hold off
on taking the next
setup because of the
feelings associated
with the last time
they took the play. In
reality, our feelings
have nothing to do
with how the next
trade will work out.
We never really
know what the
market is going to do



==================================================
                    PAGE 2885

next, but we can plod
along, follow our
setups, and try to
make a living.

Figure 19.12
Forex Markets—GBPUSD,
August 29, 2003
1. In this example, I will
also focus on rule 5,
which talked about
holding a stop in
place until the trend
resumes (see Figure
19.13). As I said, this
doesn’t happen very
often, but it does



==================================================
                    PAGE 2888                     
==================================================

happen once in a
while, and it will
make sense once I
show it to you. This
is a weekly chart of
GBPUSD. I like to
use the weekly chart
to catch macro trend
reversals, as these
can result in big
plays. The stops are
also wider, so it is
important to
determine position



==================================================
                    PAGE 2889                     
==================================================

size correctly on this
larger time frame. In
this weekly chart, a
new low bar is
created during the
week of August 29,
2003, with a low of
1.5620. The very
next week, prices dip
below this level to
1.5612, creating a
new low bar. Because
this is a weekly bar,
the only time action



==================================================
                    PAGE 2890                     
==================================================

is taken is at the end
of the week. These
plays require a lot of
patience.

Figure 19.13
2. There is a close above
the high of the low
week during the week
ending September 12,
at point 2. The entry
is 1.6037.
3. GBPUSD rallies
strongly the
following week and
then edges up for the
next several weeks.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2893                     
==================================================

During the week of
November 9, labeled
at point 3, prices fall
below the two-bar
trailing stop
intraweek, but then
rally and close above
the lows by 30 pips.
At this point, if we
move the two-bar
trailing stop up to the
next bar, we will be
stopped out because
prices are already



==================================================
                    PAGE 2894                     
==================================================

trading below that
new stop. This is
what I talked about in
rule 5. Because of
this, I just leave my
closing stop in place,
which is designated
by the longer line
reaching out from
point 3. I will just
leave my stop here
until I am stopped out
or until prices make
new trend highs.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2895                     
==================================================

4. At point 4, prices
make new trend
highs, and I go ahead
and resume my two-
bar trailing stop.
5. GBPUSD rallies
strongly until my
two-bar trailing stop
is hit during the week
ending March 5,
2004, about six
months after the
entry, for a gain of



==================================================
                    PAGE 2896                     
==================================================

2,424 pips, or
$24,240 per contract.
This is the type of
trade that makes the
forex markets
interesting, because a
trader could take a
$50,000 account in
this example and
make a million
dollars on the trade.
Needless to say, there
is also the obvious
risk of losing the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2897                     
==================================================

entire $50,000. It
wouldn’t be fun if it
were easy.
Summing Up the HOLP
and LOHP Plays
There are two ways to try to
catch tops and bottoms: the
wrong way and the only way.
Shorting a stock or a market
just because it is too high is
the trader’s version of
committing suicide. Just as a

                    PAGE 2898                     
==================================================

dog will generally let you
know when it’s about to
attack, a market will let you
know that it is about to
reverse. All you have to do is
pay attention and be alert to
the appropriate entry signal.

==================================================

hold a seat on the CME
Group/CBOT via an IDEM. I
am also John’s business
partner in many other
ventures.
Welcome to the chapter
from a guy who hates to
write. There are only a few
things I’m good at, and
writing isn’t one of them.
You have been warned;
continue reading at your own
risk. John said that he would



==================================================
                    PAGE 2901                     
==================================================

read over my text and
attempt to clean up what he
could. I wish him the best of
luck.
I don’t think I have a
natural talent for anything,
but there are skills that I’ve
developed and refined over
time. Trading is in my blood,
and I’m also an excellent
entrepreneur, which is a form
of trading. I understand how
business and marketing



==================================================
                    PAGE 2902                     
==================================================

work, and I’m great at taking
complicated subjects and
breaking them down so that
they’re easy to understand.
In John’s first version of
this book, I had it easy. All I
had to do was give John
several screen shots showing
a few of my trading setups,
such as the Ping-Pong play
on KLAC. Then all John had
to do was “write all the
content for the chapter.” I



==================================================
                    PAGE 2903                     
==================================================

actually thought that writing
the content was the easy part.
Hell, I had to find those
charts, didn’t I? I was
horribly wrong. This time,
John suggested that I write
an entire chapter from
scratch. That sounded good. I
asked, “How long does the
chapter need to be, and when
do you need it?”
He said, “It needs to be
about 20 pages. I know how



==================================================
                    PAGE 2904                     
==================================================

much you hate to write.
That’s why I’m telling you
three months in advance.
And don’t worry too much
about the text. Just take some
screen shots, with detailed
explanations of how your
trade setups work.” He gave
me three months’ notice. I
got this to him about 30
minutes before his deadline
to the publisher.

Because I hate writing so
much, I’ll include a link for a
video update at the end of
this chapter. I love doing
videos. I hate to write. Why?
There are a few reasons.

I’m dyslexic. That’s a broad
defining term for a learning
disability that impairs a
person’s ability to read and
spell. Many dyslexics switch

==================================================

letters and numbers. What
you see as an E, I might see
as a 3.
If you suffer from
dyslexia, or if you think your
child has dyslexia, don’t
worry too much about it. It’s
not a bad thing. I’ve never
seen my dyslexia as a
learning disability. People
with dyslexia process
information differently, and I
see that as a gift and an



==================================================
                    PAGE 2907                     
==================================================

advantage. One of the big
advantages of being dyslexic
is that we learn and process
information in a different
way from most people. Hell,
who wants to be like
everyone else anyway?
Different is good. Dyslexia
helps me process an
extremely complicated
subject and break it down
into its simplest parts. There
is a great book on the
subject, The Gift of Dyslexia:

What kind of a sick joke,
or twisted mind, came up
with the name dyslexia
anyway? They must have
known how difficult it would
be to spell dyslexia without
spell check or Google. It’s
almost impossible, but it



==================================================
                    PAGE 2909

trading setups, working right
now in the markets. I’m
going to create screen shots,

==================================================

along easily. Let’s jump into
the world of trading.
Welcome to Trading. Are
You Ready for the Bad
News?
Okay, which do you want
first, good news or bad
news? Let’s start with the
bad. You have less than a 9
percent chance of ever
making any money day-
trading the markets over the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2913                     
==================================================

long haul. Ouch! That stung
a little, didn’t it? The good
news is, your account’s
destruction will happen
quickly, so you won’t be in
pain that long. It will be like
ripping off a Band-Aid. Has
anyone ever told you that if
you rip it off fast, it won’t
hurt as much? You’ve been
lied to there, too. It still hurts
like crazy, and I actually
think it hurts worse. Many
people who try to do it that



==================================================
                    PAGE 2914                     
==================================================

way lose most, if not all, of
their money within the first
three months. Another stat
you need to know is that
most people blow out three
accounts before they figure
out how to do this. Fun, fun,
fun.
Or are all successful
traders just a little crazy? I
actually think all successful
traders are abnormal, for
what it’s worth. If you think



==================================================
                    PAGE 2915                     
==================================================

you are a little odd, or
strange, or different, the good
news is that you might have
what it takes to become a
successful trader. Welcome
to the Land of Weirdos. I’m
not pointing fingers; I’m
right there with you. We are
an odd lot. Where else in the
world can you go to a room
and see grown men and
women staring at price action
charts like they’re porn, for
hours at a time? When a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2916                     
==================================================

group of traders get together,
it’s a little like an AA
meeting. For those who do
figure out how to do this, the
cash flow can be addictive.
But that’s a topic for a later
discussion. First, let’s see if I
can share some good trade
setups with you. Then you
can go out and start making
some consistent income.
It’s Not Your Fault



==================================================
                    PAGE 2917                     
==================================================

If you are losing money
trading, it might not be your
fault. Oddly enough, most
people trade the first market
they come to, whether it
matches their trading
personality or not. Most
people don’t know that
markets have individual
trading personalities.
For example, if you’re
trading the index e-minis,
which are made up of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2918                     
==================================================

mini-sized Dow, the E-mini
S&P, the E-mini Nasdaq, and
the E-mini Russell, and
you’re losing money, that
market might not match your
particular style of trading. So
index futures may not be the
best place to start, but that is
where most people cut their
teeth in futures trading. This
is not a good thing or a bad
thing. You just have to
understand that there are
other markets out there that



==================================================

may suit your personality
better.
Food for Thought
For example, the index
futures trading personality is
like a sprinter, moving
quickly in one direction, then
stopping, reversing, and
running back in the other
direction. If you’re getting
stopped out a lot, which
happens quite often in the E-

==================================================

minis, it’s because they are a
great countertrend trading
market. You may want to
consider trading in a different
market.
Now let’s compare gold to
the e-minis. Gold tends to
have the trading personality
of a marathon runner or the
Energizer Bunny because it
just keeps going and going
and going and going, until
you eventually get a minor



==================================================
                    PAGE 2921                     
==================================================

pullback, then it will start
again and keep on going and
going and going. So gold
would be a better trend
trading market than the E-
minis if you buy breakouts.
The setups I’m about to
share with you are working
right now in the markets, but
you and I both know that not
all trading setups last forever.
You must be willing to
adjust, adapt, and evolve

promise you that these
trading setups will always
work with these parameters.
They can and will change
over time, so make sure you

The first trades I want to

gold trades that I use on a

Why Should You Consider
Trading Gold?
By now you know that John
and I teach people how to
trade for a living at our site,
www.tradethemarkets.com.
At one of our monthly live
trading webinars, I asked
attendees the following
question: what are you
having the hardest time with



==================================================
                    PAGE 2926                     
==================================================

when it comes to your
trading? The traders on the
monthly live trading webinar
were mostly day traders
trading the E-minis. Guess
what their answer was.
As you probably guessed,
most of them were having
issues with consistent cash
flow or income generation.
The number one answer was,
“I’m getting chopped up in
the E-minis, and I can’t seem



==================================================
                    PAGE 2927                     
==================================================

to get enough consistent
winners or runners to make
up for all the small losses.”
This is pretty common with
E-minis. They just don’t
trend well on an intraday
basis.
My follow-up question
was asking what style,
strategies, and tactics they
were using to trade the E-
minis. Not all of them were
using a breakout strategy.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2928                     
==================================================

I’m not saying that a
breakout strategy will never
work on the E-minis, but
let’s face it, the odds of that
working consistently are rare.
You can occasionally buy
breakouts and trend trade the
E-minis intraday, but it has to
be at just the right time and
place. It’s like hitting
yourself in the head with a
hammer—it feels great once
you stop. Let’s face it,
trading is hard enough, so



==================================================
                    PAGE 2929                     
==================================================

why make it harder? Your
job as a professional trader
isn’t to work harder, it’s to
work smarter. Don’t get me
wrong, I like hard work as
much as the next guy. I know
from personal experience
that the harder I work, the
luckier I get.
I came to the conclusion
that most traders were in the
wrong markets for their
trading personality and style.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2930                     
==================================================

If you are always chasing at
the wrong time, or always
getting stopped at the worst
possible time, you are
probably in the wrong
markets for your trading
personality and style.
If you ever find yourself
in this type of situation, there
are only two things you can
do to fix it. One is hard, and
the other is easy.
The hard way is to learn



==================================================
                    PAGE 2931                     
==================================================

to trade that market, even if it
goes against your style.
Basically, you will be
changing your natural habits
into forced habits. It can be
done, but it’s hard, and
people tend to relapse to their
old true self. You’ve
probably heard the line, fake
it till you make it, but it’s not
a good idea in the markets
that will break you.
The easy way to figure out



==================================================
                    PAGE 2932                     
==================================================

your natural style is to
gravitate toward the market
that looks, sounds, and feels
right to you. It will take
work, but it won’t be nearly
as hard as forcing your style
on a market that won’t work
for you.
The market is a ruthless
bitch, and she will try to trip
you up every chance she
gets. She will slit your throat
and watch you bleed. She



==================================================
                    PAGE 2933                     
==================================================

doesn’t care about you, so
why should you play her
game by her rules when you
can slant the odds in your
favor and play by your rules,
where you have the edge or
advantage? I can think of no
better way than figuring out
your natural trading style,
then finding a market to
match it. Do you want to be
right, or would you rather be
wealthy?



==================================================
                    PAGE 2934                     
==================================================

So back to the story. I
wanted to help out everyone
on the monthly live trading
webinar, so the first thing I
did was look for something
with a wider average true
range. Oddly enough, it was
gold. I set out to figure a way
in which people with smaller
accounts trading one to five
lots could make about $300
to $2,000 a day. Obviously,
you won’t do that every day.
Some days are better than



==================================================
                    PAGE 2935                     
==================================================

others. There is no guarantee
of performance. These were
trades I was doing in my own
live trading account with
smaller size, so I could figure
out whether or not I could
teach them to others to
enhance their chances of
trading success. I found a
few methodologies that I
could share with them that
would work.
So You Want to Be a

                    PAGE 2936                     
==================================================

Rainmaker
Rainmaker is a term that is
used broadly across many
different niches. It basically
means either that you get
paid to make money, or that
you’re really good at making
money “rain.”
There are two main
schools of thought when it
comes to becoming a
rainmaker. Number one, you
can put in a ton of time,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2937                     
==================================================

sweat, and energy to learn
everything and anything
there is about trading so that
you can make as much
money as possible with your
newfound skills. For long-
term, consistent cash flow, I
believe this is the best way.
Unfortunately, most people
don’t have the time, energy,
and dedication. And if the
stress doesn’t get you, the
vodka and tequila will. Sorry,
liver, I will try to be nicer to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2938                     
==================================================

you in the future. Heads up:
if you do have the occasional
drink from time to time, take
some milk thistle to help
protect your liver.
The second school of
thought is that you don’t
have to become a total
package rainmaker if you’re
willing to figure out where
it’s raining, then head there
and set up tarps and buckets
so that you can sit and collect



==================================================
                    PAGE 2939                     
==================================================

it. Now we’re talking.
I have tried both, but I
believe the best mix of the
two is to gather some basic
knowledge on how the
markets work, just enough to
keep you from hurting
yourself, then figure out
where it’s raining and go
there, set up some tarps and
buckets, and collect the rain.
Let everyone else work
harder so that you can work



==================================================
                    PAGE 2940                     
==================================================

smarter.
Let’s take the S&P E-
minis, for example. Pretend
that the average true range
(ATR) for the S&P is 10
points and you want to take
out 2 of those 10 points every
day. Sounds easy, right?
It sounds easier than it
actually is. The average true
range is really just the
average daily range of that
market from its low to its



==================================================
                    PAGE 2941                     
==================================================

high or from its high to its
low.
Now let’s assume, for
example, that during that
same time, gold’s average
true range is, say, 40. Which
one do you think it’s going to
be easier to grab 2 points out
of?
Your common sense tells
you that it should be easier to
make 2 points from a 40-
point move than to make 2



==================================================
                    PAGE 2942                     
==================================================

points from a 10-point move.
Which one would you
rather try? Would it be easier
to land a plane on a large
runway, or would it be easier
to land a plane on an aircraft
carrier? Obviously, the
longer runway is going to be
more forgiving of any errors
you make in the process than
the aircraft carrier.

==================================================
                    PAGE 2943                     
==================================================

One of my favorite movies is
Shawshank Redemption. In
the movie, Andy Dufresne is
wrongly convicted of a
murder he didn’t commit. He
is in the process of escaping
from prison, but in order to
escape, he must burst a two-
foot-diameter sewer pipe,
then crawl 500 yards through
feces to escape and claim his
freedom. This is a line from
the movie:



==================================================
                    PAGE 2944                     
==================================================

Andy crawled
to freedom
through five
hundred yards
of shit
smelling
foulness I
can’t even
imagine, or
maybe I just
don’t want to.
Five hundred



==================================================
                    PAGE 2945                     
==================================================

yards … that’s
the length of
five football
fields, just shy
of half a mile.
You’re probably
wondering why I’m telling
you this, and where it’s
going. Great question. It’s a
great analogy for trading. I
have no clue how you make
money without first risking
it. In order to find the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2946                     
==================================================

profitable trades, you must
get dirty, crawl around in
some feces, get stopped out
on some trades, and lose
some money. There is no
way I know of to tweak out
the bad trades so that you
only get the good ones.
If there were a field full of
diamonds covered in feces,
and it was a race to find as
many as you could in the
shortest amount of time,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2947                     
==================================================

what would you do? If you
were smart, you would roll
up your sleeves and get to
work, stink and all. Again,
there are no perfect trade
setups and no perfect traders.
Try not to make trade setups
too complicated. Don’t look
for a confirmation of a
confirmation of a
confirmation, for example,
because you are too afraid of
being stopped out and losing
money. Stop losses are a

large part of what we do;
they’re how we manage our
risk.
You must learn to be
comfortable with your
discomfort.

one you could never get out
of your head, just like when
you take your kids to

Small World After All.
Don’t worry if you don’t
know how to trade gold
futures; I’m going to teach
you everything you need to
know so that you can get up
and running as quickly as
possible. We’ve already
discussed the trading
personality of the gold
market, so we can skip that
and move right into the
contract specs.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2950                     
==================================================

Any time you look at
trading a new market, or
adding a new market to your
trading toolbox, you must
figure out the contract
specifications. The contract
for gold that we will be
trading is the biggie (not the
mini or micro contract). The
symbol is GC, and it is
currently traded on
COMEX/NYMEX, which is
owned by the CME Group.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2951                     
==================================================

The minimum tick move
for gold (GC) is 10 cents.
Each 10-cent move is worth
$10. For example, if gold
goes from 1880 to 1880.10,
that is 1 tick, and that 1 tick
is worth $10. There are 10
ticks in every point of gold,
so every point of gold is
worth $100 per contract. If
you’re using more contracts,
multiply by that number
accordingly.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2952                     
==================================================

You must know how
much it will cost you to trade
gold. There are two different
factors you need to know;
one is the intraday margin for
gold, and the other is the
overnight margin. The
exchange sets the minimum
intraday margins and the
minimum overnight margins,
but your broker can, and in
most cases will, increase
those minimums. It does this
to protect both itself and you.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2953                     
==================================================

Margins also change when
a market grows volatile. The
exchange will increase them
in an attempt to limit
volatility. Sometimes it
works, and sometimes it
makes things worse. The
easiest way for you to find
out what the intraday and
overnight margins are is to
pick up your phone and call
your broker or clearing firm.
It should be more than glad
to help you. If it isn’t, switch

The Famous Good Night
Gold Trade
The first gold trade I’m
going to share with you is the
famous good night gold
trade. This is a simple trade
setup, but don’t let that fool
you. It is extremely powerful.
I’ve found over the years that
the simple stuff usually kicks
the shit out of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2955                     
==================================================

complicated stuff. For some
reason, I get the most
questions on this simple
setup. I think the reason I get
the most questions on this
setup is that it’s so simple
and easy that most people try
to make it more complicated.
If you find yourself wanting
to add more stuff to this
trade, I caution you not to.
Here is a famous quote. I’m
not sure who said it, but it’s
great!



==================================================
                    PAGE 2956                     
==================================================

The system
wasn’t
designed so
that most
people could
beat it. Most
traders take a
good system
and destroy it
by trying to
make it into a
perfect system.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2957                     
==================================================

What I have found over
the years is that most people
don’t like losing money.
Successful traders don’t like
it either. But it is a risk thing,
and I would rather lose a
little than a lot, and live to
fight another day.
Gold Settlement Price
The first thing you must
know about the good night
gold trade is that you have to



==================================================
                    PAGE 2958                     
==================================================

be able to figure out the
settled price of gold, or at
least be able to find it easily.
The settlement price is very
important for this setup. If
you don’t know what the
gold settlement price is, you
won’t be able to make this
trade.
The gold settlement price
is determined at 1:30 p.m.
EST. There is a close price
and a settlement price. You



==================================================
                    PAGE 2959                     
==================================================

want the settlement price, not
the close price. It doesn’t
really matter what it means;
all you need to know is that
you want to know the
settlement price of gold, or at
least where to find it.
Notice that at point 1 in
Figure 20.1, it is 1:30 p.m.
EST on a one-minute chart.
If you can’t find the
settlement price, this will do
in a pinch. Sometimes the



==================================================
                    PAGE 2960                     
==================================================

close price and the settlement
price will be close;
sometimes they will be
further apart.



==================================================

If you are a TradeStation
or thinkorswim user, they
actually calculate it correctly
and display it as the net
change in gold price. Tada!
It’s like magic, but not all
brokers calculate their net
from the settlement at 1:30
p.m. EST; some use the
close, and others use the
electronic close. No worry
here; there is still another

a daily chart. If it’s
above 20, then yes,
it’s trending, and it is
worth trading. If it

isn’t, don’t trade.
3. Look at the daily
chart: is gold in an
uptrend or a
downtrend on the
daily chart?
4. If it’s in an uptrend,
go long at 11:30 p.m.
EST if gold is up
more than 3, but not
more than 20, from
the settlement price.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2974                     
==================================================

5. If it’s in a downtrend,
go short at 11:30 p.m.
EST if gold is down
more than 3, but not
more than 20, from
the settlement price.
6. Use a 6-point stop
loss and a 60-point
target.
7. Stay in the trade until
either the target or
the stop is hit.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2975                     
==================================================

8. You can also have
decision points or
targets at +20 and
+40 to decide
whether you are
going to keep the
trade or cut it loose if
the stop hasn’t been
hit.
This is a real sweet setup.
It works only about 30 or 40
percent of the time, but in
reality it needs to work only



==================================================
                    PAGE 2976                     
==================================================

about 1 out of 10 times
because you are risking 6 to
make 60. To break this down
to its simplest terms, the
smallest possible size that
you can trade on a gold
futures contract is one
contract. You are going to
risk $600 to potentially make
$6,000. I will take that trade
every day, all day long, and
twice on Sunday.

==================================================

Why do you
enter the trade
at 11:30 p.m.
EST?
Because you have
the Asian markets
opening and the
European markets
about to open, so
you’re getting in
front of a
potential move

Why do you

This setup works

==================================================

be in bed, so you
will not be able to
move your stop or
jump out early. It
forces you to hold
on to a winner,
while also forcing
you to cut your
losses quickly.
Let’s face it, most
of the time, when
you place the
trade with your
target and your

wake in the
morning with
either a 6-point
stop loss or a

been hit, or you
will have a

morning.

trades and trade
your plan.
How can you get
over the fear of
trading?
There are a lot of
people who will
tell you that your
job is to be an
unemotional robot
while trading, but
I think that’s a



==================================================
                    PAGE 2983                     
==================================================

load of BS. I
believe your job
is to manage
being a bumble of
nervous emotion,
and not allow
your voice or
head talk to
interfere with
your best course
of action.
It’s true that
the longer you



==================================================
                    PAGE 2984                     
==================================================

trade, the less
emotional you
get about it. But
it takes years and
years and years
of experience to
get there, so you
will have to learn
how to become
comfortable with
being
uncomfortable.

work on the gold

No, it’s too thin.
Do you do this
trade every
night?
No, I trade it only
when it meets the
checklist rules for
this setup.
What if you are
already in the

                    PAGE 2986                     
==================================================

trade from the
night before, and
you targeted a
stop, but it
hasn’t been hit.
If it meets the
criteria again
tonight, should
you add to your
position?
No. I let the trade
play itself out
before I do
another one.



==================================================
                    PAGE 2987                     
==================================================

Do you move
your stop to
breakeven once
you’re up a
little?
No, I don’t. I’m in
bed. If it’s the
next day, I still
don’t even know
that the target
hasn’t been hit. I
can decide to cut
it loose at +20 or
+40 the next day,



==================================================
                    PAGE 2988

but I never move
the stop. I have to
give it enough
room to run. It’s a
double-edged
sword, but I
believe there are
more advantages
than
disadvantages.

I’m going to take you

moves are addictive,
and this trade will fool
you into thinking that
you have more trading
skills than you actually
do, because gold is
trending well and has a
good wide ATR. Plus,
you cheated a little bit,
didn’t you? You figured
out where it was raining
and set up tarps and
buckets. You’re a little
crazy, crazy like a fox!

The Gold Rush Trade
The gold rush trades off the
advantage of the breakout
moves that gold produces
much of the time. On the
surface, it will look a little
like the good night gold
trade, but it’s not. Although
the filter criteria for this trade
are the same, it’s a different



==================================================
                    PAGE 3014                     
==================================================

setup. The reason you are
going to use these filter
criteria is to make sure that
you keep yourself on the
right side of the market, and
that you keep yourself out of
trouble by making sure that
you are not overaggressively
pursuing or chasing the
market.
You know what happens
to all dogs that chase cars,
don’t you? They eventually



==================================================
                    PAGE 3015                     
==================================================

get hit. If they survive, they
either learn their lesson the
hard way or lose more legs.
This works on intraday
and/or overnight. It’s a basic
scalp trade that can turn into
a runner if you catch it right.
For this trade, you do not
care what the daily trend is;
you just want it to be
moving.
Gold Rush Rules



==================================================
                    PAGE 3016                     
==================================================

1. Is the gold ADX on a
one- or two-minute
chart above 20? If
yes, go to step 2. If
no, stop!
2. Is gold up or down at
least 3 points on the
day, and no more
than 60 percent of its
daily ATR (average
true range)?
3. Place a buy stop at
new highs or a sell



==================================================
                    PAGE 3017                     
==================================================

stop at new lows.
4. Use a 3- to 6-point
stop loss, and use a
target that is double
your stop.
The reason you are
looking for gold to be up at
least 3 and no more than 60
percent of its daily ATR is
that it’s a safer trade. If gold
is already up one full ATR
range on the day, you don’t

have a lot to work with. I’m
not saying that it will never
break from the daily ATR
range. Actually, it does this
quite often, but we want to
play it safe. Plus, if you trade
multiple contracts on this
trade, you can always scale
out and keep the last quarter
of your trade for a runner
when it happens.

long gold.
5. Use a stop of 3 to 6
points.
6. Exit 1 is a quick scalp
of 3 to 6 points.
7. Exit 2 is to hold for a
60-point target.

gold on the daily
chart as down.
2. Wait for a
retracement of the
daily downtrend.

Figure 20.13
1. In Figure 20.13, gold
is down 18 to 20
points, but the daily
chart is in a
downtrend.
2. The retracement
happens.
3. There is a volume
spike on the one- or
two-minute chart.

4. Get short around
1630–1636 and place
a 3- to 6-point stop.
5. Scale out at twice the
stop and keep a
runner for +60 points.
Now you’re armed with
three extremely simple but
powerful gold-trading setups.
I hope they serve you as well
as they have served me.

How Do I Buy Bottoms and
Sell Tops?
This is a great strategy, and it
will work on any market with
volume. That means it will
work on everything except
for the spot forex markets.
Now, it does work better in
some markets than it does in
others. It starts out as a scalp
trade, and it can signal key
turning points for tops and
bottoms. What if you could



==================================================
                    PAGE 3038                     
==================================================

look inside a price bar or
candle and find out quickly
which side was more
aggressive right now, the
buyers or the sellers?
What this indicator does is
calculate the difference
between the volume traded at
or above the ask price and
the volume traded at or
below the bid. Then it
represents this in a histogram
form. It is very simple to tell



==================================================
                    PAGE 3039                     
==================================================

whether the current high or
low is more likely to hold or
not. The country-boy
commonsense definition of
this thing is this: it tells you
if there are aggressive buyers
at the low or if there are
aggressive sellers at the high.
The only bad thing about this
indicator is that it is real-time
only (you won’t be able to
see how it did in the past,
only how it does in real time
going forward), so you have



==================================================
                    PAGE 3040                     
==================================================

to turn it on and let it run so
that it can calculate the
bid/ask relationship.
Delta Divergence
Let’s take a closer look at
what this thing is actually
doing and how it works. The
indicator looks for a current
low or a new tick low and
calculates whether the buyers
are more aggressive than the
sellers. If they are, then that

                    PAGE 3041

gives you the edge when
you’re trying to buy lows. I
don’t know if you have ever
tried to catch a falling knife,
but it’s no fun, to say the
least.

where a group of us takes
turns throughout the day and

chance for people to see how
a group of trading room

their real accounts. Why do
this? Why subject ourselves

to the scrutiny? The
badgering? Well, if you think
trading in private is fun,
trading on a stage gets even
more intense. Why waste
precious time berating
yourself for making a
mistake when hundreds of
people can do it for you?
I’ve already discussed the
use of “anchor charts” as a
significant way to filter out
the weak setups. This

==================================================

statement should not be taken
lightly. As full-time
professional traders one of
our greatest trading tools
includes using the power of
multitime-frame analysis
(MTFA) to significantly
increase our probabilities for
success. In our day-trading
room, in addition to the TTM
squeeze, TTM wave, TTM
trend, pivots, gaps, and
market internals, two
important tools in our day-



==================================================
                    PAGE 3061                     
==================================================

trading arsenal are the TTM
momentum and TTM trigger,
which were introduced into
our room by Rob Hoffman.
As a trader, no two days and
no two trades are ever alike,
and the market is always
there to remind us not to get
too comfortable, no matter
how long we have been
doing this for a living. This is
why it’s key to have adaptive
tools at your disposal to
handle today’s ever-changing



==================================================
                    PAGE 3062                     
==================================================

market conditions.
The MTFA concept is
fairly straightforward. We’re
looking for alignment of buy-
and sell-side opportunities on
not only the time frame
we’re looking to trade, but
also the longer time frames.
We want to identify areas of
agreement between larger
players moving bigger
positions over hours or days
and generally smaller traders



==================================================
                    PAGE 3063                     
==================================================

moving in and out quickly on
shorter time frames. The
more in alignment we are
with institutional money
flows, the more successful
we are likely to be. For
interval charts, we typically
use 5-, 15-, 30-, and 60-
minute charts, as well as a
daily chart, for intraday and
overnight short-term trading
analysis. We also use various
tick charts, such as the 987
tick chart, for intraday

analysis.
Let’s Dig into the Setups
There are many ways a trader
can utilize the TTM

==================================================

versatile tool set as well as
other setups we use in the
live trading room. The
primary setup we’re looking
for with the TTM momentum
and TTM trigger indicators
are to have them fire off in
the same direction on any
individual chart that we’re
looking to trade off of. To
significantly increase our
probability of success, we’ll
want to have the next higher
time frames firing off in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3066                     
==================================================

same direction as well.
Getting Familiar with the
TTM Momentum and TTM
Trigger
The TTM momentum can be
found as two bars (slow and
fast) at the top and the
bottom of the price chart, and
the TTM trigger is found as a
histogram down below price.
See Figure 21.1.



==================================================

Figure 21.1
1. The slow sell
momentum bar can
be found at the very
top of the price
section of the chart.
2. The fast sell
momentum bar can
be found toward the
top of the price
section of the chart at
point 2, right below

                    PAGE 3069

the slow sell
momentum bar.
3. The fast buy
momentum bar can
be found toward the
bottom of the price
section of the chart,
at point 3.
4. The slow buy
momentum bar can
be found at the very
bottom of the price
section of the chart at



==================================================
                    PAGE 3070                     
==================================================

point 4, right below
the fast buy
momentum bar.
5. The buy-side trigger
appears as vertical
bars above the center
line of the histogram
below the price chart,
as seen at point 5.
6. The sell-side trigger
appears as vertical
bars below the center
line of the histogram



==================================================
                    PAGE 3071

below the price chart.
This takes place at
point 6, turning a
buy-side trigger into
a sell-side trigger.

3. Entry takes place at
the close of the bar

                    PAGE 3074                     
==================================================

the instrument you’re
trading. For instance,
as of this writing,
several instruments
are experiencing 100
to 200 percent
increases in their
average true ranges.
Therefore, using
stops associated with
“normal” market
conditions will lead
to “death by a
thousand cuts” in



==================================================
                    PAGE 3075                     
==================================================

more volatile
environments. When
in doubt, cut position
size in half and
double your stop.
This way you are
risking the same
amount of money
while also giving
your setup a chance
to survive the normal
back and forth price
action.

In the current economy, it
can be tough to find a great
job with a great boss, a quick
commute, and a salary that
makes us happy. This is one
of the reasons that many
budding traders want to enter
trading. But to achieve a
sufficient level of proficiency
to do this full time takes time

reasons we’ve made our Live

make the full transition to
professional trader status,
one option that can be
available to you in your off-
hours is swing trading. The
good news is that all of the
TTM momentum and TTM
trigger concepts just covered
can be very effective for
swing trades. The only
difference is that for swing
trading, we’re focusing on

Summing Up the Trades
The TTM momentum/trigger
setup is designed to detect
and validate a trend as early
as possible and to keep
traders on the right side of
the market for the primary
piece of the trend and
pullbacks within the trend. It

more risky top-catching and
bottom-catching tool. It was
developed many years ago,
and it has stood the test of
time through many market
cycles.

that discusses additional

To me, some of the greatest
risk takers on Wall Street are
long-term investors. They
will stubbornly hold on to a
stock that they bought three
years ago because they have
a “long-term view.” It
doesn’t matter that the
company is beating off its
creditors with a lead pipe. It
doesn’t matter that the stock
is down more than 80 percent
from the entry price. It
doesn’t even matter if the

CFO was recently seen
sharing an 8 × 8 cell with
Martha Stewart. What
matters is that, come hell or
high water, they have blind
faith that if they step back
and take the long-term view,
all will be well in the end.
All’s well that ends well,
right? Of course.
Unfortunately, this ain’t
Shakespeare’s play; this is
Wall Street.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3154                     
==================================================

This came to me in
glaring full color in early
2000. First, there was the
Super Bowl. I don’t even
remember who played in that
game, but I do remember the
18 commercials that played
advertising various dot-com
companies that were blowing
their whole annual marketing
wad on this one 30-second
spot. I also remember that
this was the time the first
ever “day-trading expo” took



==================================================
                    PAGE 3155                     
==================================================

place in southern California.
Finally, I remember my
refrigerator breaking down. It
wasn’t the actual breaking
down that was significant,
but the man I called out of
the Yellow Pages who came
to fix it for me was. The job
took him exactly 84 minutes.
The first 12 minutes were
spent fixing the refrigerator.
The rest of the time he spent
preaching to me about his
favorite stocks in the Nasdaq



==================================================
                    PAGE 3156                     
==================================================

and why Cisco was worth
$500 a share. I tried to stop
him halfway through his
lecture to let him know that a
fleck of saliva was hanging
off his chin, but he wouldn’t
let up. As he preached the
gospel of the Internet, I
realized that there was so
much excitement in this
current market that it really
didn’t matter how far down it
went when the crash finally
came—people were now



==================================================
                    PAGE 3157                     
==================================================

believers, and they would
hold on until they got their
margin call. By the time he
left, I started looking at my
charts for any breaks of the
low of the high day. There
weren’t any that day, but a
month later there were
plenty.
I do focus some of my
efforts on finding newer
companies that have the
potential to make a big



==================================================
                    PAGE 3158                     
==================================================

splash with a new product. I
look at Investor’s Business
Daily to find these
candidates. It’s the new
companies that have the
potential for big gains. There
are many long-term trend-
following opportunities in
the markets, on both the long
and the short side. However,
finding the next Microsoft is
not my trading niche. If I do
find it, great, but in the
meantime, I’m going to keep



==================================================
                    PAGE 3159                     
==================================================

looking for setups.
Therefore, most of my “long-
term” efforts in the stock
market involve swing
trading, and one of my
favorite setups is what I call
propulsion plays. This is a
systematic approach to
getting positioned in stocks
over a few days to a few
weeks. Some 70 percent of
the time, individual stocks
spend their days backing and
filling in a tight range,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3160                     
==================================================

building up steam for their
next major move. This
approach looks for stocks
that are done with their
“resting period” and are
getting ready to spurt higher
(or lower) once again.
The idea is to already be
in the stock when it makes a
push higher (for longs) or
lower (for shorts), instead of
trying to chase it intraday.
The reason I like to do this is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3161

that there are many times in
the market when very few
intraday trading opportunities
in the stock indexes set up.
Some of the sectors are up
and some are down, resulting
in a very choppy and quiet
overall market. However,
during these times, there are
always going to be individual
stocks that are making a
move. When I am positioned
in these stocks over the
course of a few days to a few

==================================================

weeks, I don’t feel forced to
get into intraday trades in the
stock index futures when
nothing is really setting up.
This is because I already
have positions on that are set
up to take advantage of the
next “mini-move.”
For this setup, I’m
focusing mostly on
individual stocks. However,
on individual stocks that also
trade single-stock futures

                    PAGE 3163                     
==================================================

(SSFs) and stock options, I
will consider plays in those
instruments as well. Because
SSFs are new and because
most people play options
incorrectly, I’m going to
spend a little time reviewing
how they work and how I use
them. Let’s review.
The Trader’s Guide to
Single-Stock Futures
Single-stock futures (SSFs)

are futures contracts on
individual stocks. There are
currently around 130 well-
known stocks, such as IBM,
QCOM, EBAY, GOOG,
RIMM, and MSFT, that have
futures on them. This is a
recent development, since it
was only in late 2000 that
Congress passed legislation
lifting the ban on these
products, which were already
trading in Europe and other
countries. There are also

futures contracts available on
many exchange-traded funds
(ETFs). To get a complete
listing of all these futures
contracts, a trader can visit
www.onechicago.com. One
Chicago is an electronic
exchange that is a joint
venture of the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE),
the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Inc. (CME), and
the Chicago Board of Trade

CBOT and CME are now
part of the same company,
CME Group. Now, how do
SSFs work and how does a
trader use them?
Many brokers have been
slow to adapt to these new
trading instruments, but they
are starting to catch on.
Because they are futures
contracts, traders need to
have a futures account in
order to trade them. On top

of that, they also need to be
trading with a broker that is
set up to trade them, as not
every broker is equipped to
handle these trading
instruments. Once that is
completed, these are traded
just like a normal futures
contract, and they are
available through eCBOT
and Globex, just like the
mini-stock index futures.
Whereas mini-stock index

futures contracts like the YM
and ES trade quarterly, the
SSFs trade monthly. Traders
who aren’t familiar with the
letter codes for the various
months should write this
down and tape it to their wall
as a reference guide. These
are applicable to all futures
contracts:



==================================================

To get a quote on an
EBAY (eBay Inc.) single-
stock futures contract in
Trade-Station, a trader would
type in EBAY (underlying
stock symbol) 1C (One
Chicago) V (Month Code) 05
(Year). So the final quote for
the EBAY October 2005
SSFs would look like this:
EBAY1CV05.
There are a few nice
features of SSFs that I find



==================================================
                    PAGE 3171                     
==================================================

attractive. First, the “$25,000
day-trading rule” does not
apply. Active traders who
have a $50,000 account and
tie up $26,000 of that in
options trades will suddenly
find themselves out of luck.
They will not be able to
execute any new stock or
options trades because the
broker won’t count the
option value toward the
traders’ equity. This situation
would draw their “countable”



==================================================
                    PAGE 3172                     
==================================================

account balance below
$25,000, and traders would
be locked out of initiating
any new trades. An annoying
situation, to be sure. SSFs
provide the leverage of “just-
in-the-money” options
without the restrictions
constraining “pattern day
traders” and their account
size. Here are a few
additional key points:
• On stock accounts, a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3173                     
==================================================

trader can get a 2:1
overnight margin, and
the interest charged is
the same amount a
person would pay for a
mediocre deal on a
credit card. For SSFs,
the equivalent of a 5:1
margin is available, and
there are no interest
fees.
• 5:1 leverage equates to
having to put up 20



==================================================
                    PAGE 3174                     
==================================================

percent of the purchase
price of the underlying
stock. A trader who
buys $10,000 worth of
IBM (100 shares at
$100) by using one
IBM SSF contract
would have to put up
only $2,000. A trader
who buys 10 contracts
of IBM1C at $95
($95,000 worth of
IBM) would put up
$19,000, and so on.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3175                     
==================================================

• When shorting stocks, a
trader has to wait for an
uptick in order to get
filled (although this rule
should be changed
soon). There isn’t any
uptick rule for short
selling an SSF contract.
This is becoming less
important as more and
more actual stocks are
becoming shortable on
downticks.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3176                     
==================================================

• One SSF contract
equals 100 shares of
stock.
• A 1-point move equals
$100 per contract.
• These are monthly
contracts that expire the
third Friday of each
month, just like options.
If traders own a
February contract on
the day it is expiring,
they will need to sell



==================================================
                    PAGE 3177                     
==================================================

the February contract
and buy the March
contract. This is also
known as “rolling over”
into the next month. If
traders hold on to the
contract through
expiration, they will
have the stock
“delivered” into their
account. Don’t worry
about forgetting,
however, because
brokers don’t want to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3178                     
==================================================

deal with this, and they
will call and pester you
to close out your
position days before
expiration.
The biggest question I get
about SSFs has to do with
their volume. For many of
these contracts, there is not a
lot of volume traded at this
time, and this is an obvious
concern for traders.
However, it is important to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3179                     
==================================================

note that the “real volume”
of an SSF contract is in the
underlying stock itself. The
LMMs (lead market makers)
and MMs (market makers)
for SSF products make their
living buying and selling SSF
contracts and immediately
hedging or arbitraging that
position with the underlying
cash stock. Because of this,
they will fill any order that is
in line with the underlying
volume of the stock. Since



==================================================
                    PAGE 3180                     
==================================================

most of these stocks trade
millions of shares, getting a
fill is not an issue. There
have been days when I’ve
been the only one trading the
SSF, and yet I have had no
problem getting into and out
of the position. On those
days, which rarely happen
anymore because volume is
steadily growing, it’s fun
knowing that I’m the only
person in the entire world
who made money on that



==================================================
                    PAGE 3181                     
==================================================

trade.
The other question I get
from traders involves the
spreads. If there aren’t any
orders coming in, then the
LMMs and MMs will keep
the spreads wide. This is so
that they don’t end up trading
against each other. However,
once a real order comes in,
they will close the bid and
ask to be in line with those
on the underlying stock and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3182                     
==================================================

snap it up. Because of this, I
never use market orders
when I’m getting into an SSF
trade. I just look to see where
the underlying stock is
trading and place a limit
order based on the price of
the underlying stock.
The other thing to
remember about SSFs is that
their charts are pretty much
worthless at this time. The
volume is sporadic, so the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3183                     
==================================================

charts aren’t very clean. The
best thing to do is to chart the
underlying cash stock and
then base all decisions to get
into and out of the SSFs on
the underlying stock. What I
will do is set up the chart of
an underlying cash stock and
then put the quotes for both
the cash stock and the SSF
contract below it so that I can
see where the current bid/ask
is located. However, because
most of my trades in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3184                     
==================================================

SSFs are swing trades, I
don’t even watch the charts
intraday. I just set up my
limit orders the night before
based on the cash chart and
then wait until the end of the
day to see if I’m filled.
We’ll look at a couple of
sample plays on EBAY and
QCOM in a moment. First I
want to discuss options
quickly.

Individual Stock Options
I’m writing this section based
on the premise that the reader
knows at least a little about
what options are and how
they work. If not, that’s okay.
There are plenty of websites
out there that explain them in
detail, and I would
recommend reading more
about what options are and
how they work if you plan on
using them. I’m just going to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3186                     
==================================================

give you a quick rundown
and share how I incorporate
them into my trading plan.
(Of course, this new edition
of the book has a new
chapter on options, Chapter
5.)
There are many
complicated option strategies
available, and many people
spend hundreds of hours
looking for the perfect
strategies to generate



==================================================
                    PAGE 3187                     
==================================================

“guaranteed income.” Most
of these strategies work great
when the markets are range-
bound— which they are most
of the time. Then along
comes the inevitable big rally
or watershed decline, and all
these people get thrashed.
For a period of years in the
mid-1990s, a lot of traders
and funds made a nice living
selling naked puts. These are
put options whose writers do
not have a short position in



==================================================
                    PAGE 3188                     
==================================================

the stock on which they have
written the put. The goal here
is to have the options expire
worthless, so that the put
writers collect the premium.
Many books started popping
up on the shelves about
“taxi-driver millionaires”
who discovered this
“amazing get-rich-quick”
trading strategy. Then along
came October 27, 1997.
The markets had been



==================================================
                    PAGE 3189                     
==================================================

drifting down through
October, and many of the
taxi drivers, as well as
several large funds with a
few hundred million in
assets, were busy selling
naked puts. The brokers who
worked with the funds started
getting nervous because the
positions had gone against
the funds to the point where
it wouldn’t take much of a
further decline to start
forcing margin calls. The



==================================================
                    PAGE 3190                     
==================================================

brokers, who didn’t quite
understand the strategy that
the funds were using, started
to place discreet calls to
other traders asking what
would happen “if the Dow
dropped a couple of hundred
more points” over the next
week or so. The answer was
easy—these funds would be
forced to dump their
positions because of margin
calls, and this would create
tremendous downward



==================================================
                    PAGE 3191                     
==================================================

selling pressure in the overall
markets. The S&P 500 floor
traders at the CME got wind
of this and started prepping
for the slaughter.
On October 16, 1997, the
Dow broke through its most
recent uptrend line, as seen at
point 1 in Figure 22.1. The
Dow then rallied and closed
at 8034.65 on October 22,
just below its broken trend
line, at point 2. This is a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3192                     
==================================================

common occurrence in all
markets—once a trend line is
broken, the markets will
come up and test it one last
time before rolling over. I
call this “kissing the trend
line goodbye.” On October
24, at point 3, the Dow
closed at 7715.41, down
319.24 points. This started
the round of forced margin
calls after the close, which
was on a Friday. The margin
call selling would take place



==================================================
                    PAGE 3193                     
==================================================

on Monday. The Dow
opened Monday at 7633.14,
down 82.27. Then the forced
selling via the margin calls
began—and the S&P pit
traders, who knew what was
happening, simply stepped
back and walked away from
the bids. With no support in
the markets, the Dow
dropped quickly and closed
at 7161.39, down 554.02
points on the day, as seen at
point 4. By the time the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3194                     
==================================================

closing bell rang on Monday,
everyone who was selling
naked puts for a living had
lost a substantial amount of
money. The funds that were
involved not only lost all the
money under their
management, but ended up
owing money to the brokers.
Well, more correctly, the
people who had invested in
the fund lost all their money,
and ended up owing more
than they had put into the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3195                     
==================================================

fund. Many metaphors come
to mind here, but I will pass,
as most of them are quite
graphic in nature. Once all
these people were cleaned
out, the markets were set to
rally. The very next day, the
markets pushed down to new
lows, touching 6927 at point
5, having shed just over
1,000 points in three trading
days, before putting in a hard
bottom. The Dow then closed
at 7498.32, up 336.93 points



==================================================
                    PAGE 3196                     
==================================================

on the day, and went on to
rally steadily from there.
Once all of the naked put
sellers were cleaned out,
there was nothing to do but
resume the uptrend.

Figure 22.1
Okay, so how do I use
options? The main way I use
options is as a means for
owning a stock at a cheaper
price. Because of the
premium and time decay, I
am very specific about the
options I buy. For example, I
won’t buy out-of-the-money
options, as they are all
premium and a sucker’s
game. Therefore, I want to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3199                     
==================================================

look at options that are
trading in the money (“in the
money” means that the
option’s strike price is below
the current market price of
the stock for call options, and
that the strike price is above
the current market price of
the stock for put options), if
not more, in order to buy an
option where the premium
constitutes less than 30
percent of the overall
purchase price. In early 2005,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3200                     
==================================================

the premium of options was
generally low, so I could
usually buy options just one
strike in the money to meet
this criterion. In 1999 and
2000, however, option
premiums had been at
extremes, and I often had to
go 5 to 10 strikes in the
money to buy options that
met my criteria. I remember
when QCOM was at $250
before its infamous “run to a
thousand” at the end of 1999.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3201                     
==================================================

At-the-money call options
were $45. In order to buy
calls that were only 30
percent premium, I had to go
nearly 15 strikes in the
money.
The option table
represented in Figure 22.2
shows different strike prices
and expiration months for
GOOG. At the time this was
created, in early November
2004, GOOG was trading at



==================================================
                    PAGE 3202                     
==================================================

$191.67. If I am interested in
buying a call on this stock,
I’ll start looking at the near-
month contracts that are in
the money. Because GOOG
is a higher-priced, volatile
stock, the option premiums
are going to be high—the
higher the volatility, the
higher the premium. In this
case, I look at the November
180 calls, which are two
strikes in the money. The
premium on these is still



==================================================
                    PAGE 3203                     
==================================================

excessive, and I need to go
down one more strike price,
to the November 175 calls, to
meet my criterion of the
premium being less than 30
percent of the overall
purchase price. The amateur
option trader in this case is
going to buy the November
220 calls because they are so
“cheap” at $2.55. Never
mind that they will expire
worthless. For puts, I first
look at the November 200



==================================================
                    PAGE 3204                     
==================================================

puts, but they are too
expensive. I look at the 210s,
and they are close, but the
220s are better with respect
to the amount of premium I
want to pay. Remember, all
I’m trying to do is buy (or
short) the actual stock at a
cheaper price. This means
that I don’t want a lot of
premium. Looking at the
next month out in December,
these same strike prices jump
up excessively in price, so I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3205                     
==================================================

want to stay with the near-
month contracts and wait
until expiration to roll over
into December if I have to.
I’ll explain more about how
to figure out premium
shortly. (As I discussed in
Chapter 5, an easy way to do
this is just to buy an option
with a delta of 0.70 or
higher.)

==================================================

Figure 22.2
In contrast to GOOG,
IBM is a more stable stock,
and the premiums here aren’t
that high. With the stock
trading at $91.20, I first look
at the November 90 calls, but
they have too much premium
(see Figure 22.3). The 85s fit
the bill nicely. On the put
side, the first strike in the
money, the 95s, works fine.
Note that I could even go out



==================================================
                    PAGE 3208                     
==================================================

to the next month, the
December 95s, and pay only
a little extra in premium. I
like to focus on the near-
month contract in order to
reduce premium. However, if
the option is set to expire in
less than two weeks, then I
will go ahead and buy the
next month out, though I may
have to go even deeper in the
money. Following are a few
more notes of interest on
options contracts:



==================================================
                    PAGE 3209                     
==================================================

• One option contract
equals 100 shares
of stock.
• If you buy 10
GOOG November
190 calls at $12,
that will cost
$12,000.
• To buy an
equivalent 1,000
shares of the stock



==================================================
                    PAGE 3210                     
==================================================

at $190 would cost
$190,000.
• If GOOG rallies by
10 points, these
options will move
about 6 points. This
depends on how far
in the money they
are. The further
they are in the
money, the more
they will move
“dollar for dollar”

GOOG calls at $18
($18,000), you will
pocket $6,000.
• The maximum loss
on this trade is the
option’s cost,
$12,000.
By contrast to this last
bullet point, if a trader



==================================================
                    PAGE 3214                     
==================================================

bought 1,000 shares of
GOOG at $190 and it gapped
down 30 points on an
earnings report, the trader
would be out $30,000.
Options do limit risk if they
are purchased correctly. Now
that we’ve reviewed SSFs
and stock options, let’s get
down to the play itself.
Trading Rules for Buy
Fades (Sells Are Reversed)



==================================================
                    PAGE 3215                     
==================================================

This is a fade play that
focuses on swing positions
that last a few days to a few
weeks. I am looking to sell
strength and buy weakness.
1. For these plays, I am
utilizing a daily chart.
Because these plays
are meant to last a
few days to a few
weeks, I’m not
interested in what is
happening on a 5- or



==================================================
                    PAGE 3216                     
==================================================

15-minute chart. I
want to be able to
step back and look at
a slightly bigger
picture without all the
noise found in
intraday charts.
2. The only indicators I
place on the daily
chart are an 8- and a
21-period exponential
moving average
(EMA).



==================================================
                    PAGE 3217                     
==================================================

3. For longs, I want to
see the 8-period
EMA trading above
the 21-period EMA.
Once this upward
cross happens, then I
can start looking for a
setup to occur.
4. The specific setup
I’m looking for, once
the 8-period EMA
has crossed above the
21-period EMA, is a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3218                     
==================================================

pullback to the 8-
period EMA.
5. The initial stop is the
21-period EMA or 4
percent of the stock
price, whichever is
greater. Typically the
initial stop turns out
to be this 4 percent
level. Note that this 4
percent level is based
on the price of the
stock, not my equity



==================================================
                    PAGE 3219                     
==================================================

level. That is, I’m not
risking 4 percent of
my equity on one
trade; I’m risking 4
percent of the price
of the stock. I could
have 10 stocks going
at one time.
6. Once I’m up 4
percent on the
position (I call this
my watermark level),
I will move up my



==================================================
                    PAGE 3220                     
==================================================

stop to the 21-period
EMA. I will then use
this 21-period EMA
as a trailing stop until
my target or trailing
stop is hit.
7. My target is an 8
percent move in the
price of the stock
from my entry price.
Although I focus
mostly on stocks
when I’m using this



==================================================
                    PAGE 3221                     
==================================================

play, it can also be
used on the stock
index futures.
However, the
percentages will be
different. On a daily
chart, instead of an 8
percent target, I just
use a 1 percent target
and a 0.5 percent stop
to start. If the mini-
sized Dow is at
10,604, then my
target is 106 points,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3222                     
==================================================

and my initial stop is
53 points or the 21-
period EMA,
whichever is greater.
On a 60-minute chart,
I cut this in half,
using a target of ½ of
1 percent and a stop
of ¼ of 1 percent or
the 21-period EMA,
whichever is greater.
To get these, I just
multiply the price of
the index by 0.005



==================================================
                    PAGE 3223                     
==================================================

for the target and by
0.0025 for the stop. A
sample play of this
nature is discussed in
Chapter 23.
8. The easiest way to
figure out all these
levels is to quickly
set up an Excel
spreadsheet with the
formulas already in
place (see Figure
22.3).



==================================================
                    PAGE 3224                     
==================================================

9. One way to slightly
increase the odds of
success on long
setups is to trade only
stocks where the 8-
period EMA is higher
than the 21-period
EMA on the weekly
charts. This condition
can last on a weekly
chart for months and
even years. If this
setup exists on the
weekly charts, then



==================================================
                    PAGE 3225                     
==================================================

it’s just a matter of
waiting for an entry
on the daily chart as
per this setup. This
process is discussed
in more detail in
Chapter 23.
Figure 22.4 is a snapshot
of the exact Excel
spreadsheet I use to calculate
my key stop and target
levels. All I do is enter my
entry price in the highlighted



==================================================
                    PAGE 3226                     
==================================================

box. If I’m long on the stock,
then I use the “long” box,
and vice versa. Once the
price is in, the Excel
spreadsheet calculates all the
levels for me automatically.
The formulas are very
simple. For example, the
target is calculated by taking
the entry price and
multiplying it by 0.08 (8
percent). The initial stop is
calculated by taking the entry
price, multiplying it by 0.04



==================================================
                    PAGE 3227                     
==================================================

(4 percent), and subtracting it
from the entry. The 4 percent
watermark level is calculated
by taking the entry price,
multiplying it by 0.04 (4
percent), and adding it to the
entry price. I used to do all
this manually, and it was a
real buzz killer.

EBAY (eBay, Inc.)—August
19, 2004
1. On August 10, 2004,
EBAY crosses above
its 8-period EMA
(see Figure 22.5).
However, since the 8-
period EMA is still
trading below the 21-
period EMA, I am
not interested in
setting up a buy order
just yet. I need to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3230                     
==================================================

wait for the 8-period
EMA to cross up
through the 21-period
EMA before I set up
my first buy order.
Note: on all these
charts, the 8-period
EMA is the skinny
moving average line,
and the 21-period
EMA is the thicker
moving average line.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3231                     
==================================================

                    PAGE 3232                     
==================================================

Figure 22.5
2. On August 19, the 8-
period EMA crosses
up above the 21-
period EMA. I’m
now ready to start
bidding for a long,
and my entry point
will be a pull-back to
the 8-period EMA.
The next day I am
filled at 79.28 when
the market pulls back



==================================================
                    PAGE 3233                     
==================================================

to the 8-period EMA.
Now that I’m in the
trade, I need to check
where to place my
stop. The 21-period
EMA is at 79.08,
which is not very far
below my entry level.
A 4 percent stop
would be placed at
76.11. Since the 4
percent stop is
greater, this is the
stop I will use to start



==================================================
                    PAGE 3234                     
==================================================

out with. My target is
8 percent up from my
entry, which is 85.62.
Remember, once I’m
up 4 percent in the
position, I will move
my stop up to the 21-
period EMA. The
initial stop and target
for this play are
highlighted on the
chart with the
horizontal lines.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3235                     
==================================================

3. On August 25, EBAY
pushes higher and
hits my target, and
I’m out for just over
$6 per share ($6.34).
Now that I’m out, it’s
time to start looking
for the next pullback
to the 8-period EMA.
A trader could also
have followed this
same play using
single-stock futures
or in-the-money call



==================================================
                    PAGE 3236                     
==================================================

options. I will review
those possibilities for
this play in a
moment.
4. On September 9, 10
trading days later,
EBAY pulls back to
its 8-period EMA,
and I am filled at
87.95. I do a quick
calculation, and I see
that my target is
going to be 95.78 and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3237                     
==================================================

my stop is 84.43. I
set my parameters
and let my orders
babysit my position.
5. Four trading days
later my target is hit,
and I’m out of the
trade.
6. On September 17, the
market pulls back to
the 8-period EMA
once again. I take the
trade, and I get in at



==================================================
                    PAGE 3238                     
==================================================

91.74 and set my
parameters. This
would be a stop of
88.07 and a target of
99.08. At the time I
did this chart, I was
still in the trade, so it
was “active.”
I’d like to take a moment
to examine the first EBAY
play detailed in Figure 22.5
more closely. This play could
also have been executed



==================================================
                    PAGE 3239                     
==================================================

using single-stock futures or
in-the-money call options. It
is useful to compare these
trades to the actual stock
trade to get an idea of how
this setup could have been
followed on these various
trading instruments. This will
also give a trader an idea of
the risk/reward parameters
for each scenario. Although
it’s the exact same play
across all three instruments,
the amount risked versus the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3240                     
==================================================

amount gained is different
for each of the three
scenarios. Let’s take a look:
• Buy 1,000 shares of
EBAY stock at $79.28.
Total cost is $79,280.
• Buy 10 EBAY1C
September single-stock
futures (SSF) contracts
at $79.28. Total cost is
$15,856 (20 percent of
$79,280).



==================================================
                    PAGE 3241                     
==================================================

• Buy 10 EBAY
September 75 call
options at $6.10. Total
cost is $6,100.
To figure out the premium
on an options contract,
people can look at the delta,
or, if they aren’t familiar
with that, just use a
calculator: with the stock at
$79.28, a $75 call option
costs



==================================================
                    PAGE 3242                     
==================================================

, and $81.10 – $79.28 (the
actual price of the stock) =
$1.82. The option, then, has
$4.28 of intrinsic (real) value
and $1.82 of premium. The
ratio is 29.84 percent
(1.82/6.10).
Now that we’ve looked at
the total costs for each entry,
let’s take a look at the exits:
• Sell 1,000 shares of
EBAY stock at $85.62,
a gain of $6,340, or



==================================================
                    PAGE 3243                     
==================================================

8.00 percent (or 16.00
percent if bought on
margin).
• Sell 10 EBAY1C
September SSF
contracts at $85.62, a
gain of $6,340, or 40
percent.
• Sell 10 EBAY
September 75 calls at
$12.20, a gain of
$6,100, or 100 percent.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3244                     
==================================================

As you can see, using this
exact same setup, a trader
could put up $79,280 in cash
to buy the stock (or $39,640
if he is using margin),
$15,856 to buy the single-
stock futures, or $6,100 to
buy the options. The dollar
outcome of the trade is very
close across all three
scenarios—a little over
$6,000. By using SSFs or the
correct in-the-money option
strike prices, a trader can risk



==================================================
                    PAGE 3245                     
==================================================

less capital for the same
potential monetary gain of
the stock play. It is up to the
trader to decide whether she
wants to focus on stocks,
SSFs, options, or a
combination of the three.
QCOM (Qualcomm, Inc.)—
August 19, 2004
1. The 8-period EMA
pushes above the 21-
period EMA, and I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3246                     
==================================================

place my bid (see
Figure 22.6). Two
days later, on August
20, 2004, I am filled
at 35.47. I place a
stop at 34.05 and a
target at 38.31. By
the time trading is
done this day, the
stock is already up by
4 percent from my
entry, so I move my
stop up to the 21-
period EMA, which



==================================================
                    PAGE 3247                     
==================================================

is 35.34.

==================================================

Figure 22.6
2. On Monday, August
23, QCOM continues
to push higher, and
my target is hit. I
immediately set up a
bid to buy the next
pullback to the 8-
period EMA.
3. On August 30, my
trailing bid is hit, and
I’m in at 37.51. I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3250                     
==================================================

place a stop at 36.01
and a target at 40.51.
4. About two weeks
later, on September
13, my target is hit.
Note that when the
stock is up by 4
percent from my
entry on September
7, I raise my stop to
the 21-period EMA at
37.42, and I trail this
stop until my target is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3251                     
==================================================

hit.
As I did with EBAY, let’s
take a look at executing this
same QCOM play across all
three trading instruments.
Here is how the entries
would break down:
• Buy 1,000 shares of
QCOM at $37.51. Total
cost is $37,510.
• Buy 10 QCOM1C



==================================================
                    PAGE 3252                     
==================================================

September SSF
contracts at $37.51.
Total cost is $7,502 (20
percent of $37,510).
• Buy 10 QCOM
September 35 calls at
$3.10. Total cost is
$3,100.
To figure out the premium
on the QCOM options, just
take $35.00 + $3.10 = 38.10.
There is $2.51 of real value



==================================================
                    PAGE 3253                     
==================================================

($37.51 – $35.00) and 0.59
cents of premium (3.10 –
2.51 = 0.59). The ratio is
19.03 percent (0.59/3.10).
We’ve looked at the total
costs for each entry, so now
let’s take a look at the exits:
• Sell 1,000 shares of
QCOM at $40.51, a
gain of $3,000, or 8
percent, or 16 percent if
using margin.
• Sell 10 QCOM1C



==================================================
                    PAGE 3254                     
==================================================

September SSF
contracts at $40.51, a
gain of $3,000, or 40
percent.
• Sell 10 QCOM
September 35 calls at
$5.90, a gain of $2,800,
or 90.32 percent.
Once again, using this
exact same setup, a trader
could put up $37,510 in cash
to buy the stock (or $18,755



==================================================
                    PAGE 3255                     
==================================================

if she is using margin),
$7,502 to buy the single-
stock futures, or $3,100 to
buy the options. The dollar
outcome of the trade is very
close across all three
scenarios—about $3,000.
Now that you have the idea,
I’m just going to focus on the
actual stock plays for the rest
of this chapter. Of course,
not all stocks have options
and single-stock futures
available on them, so some



==================================================
                    PAGE 3256                     
==================================================

of these plays can be
executed only on the actual
stock.
KLAC (KLA-Tencor Corp.)

EMA crosses below
the 21-period EMA
and the price action
moves below both
these levels on
KLAC, I start

                    PAGE 3257                     
==================================================

looking for the next
shorting opportunity
(see Figure 22.7). I
want to short a rally
back to the 8-period
EMA, and on July 9,
2004, I am filled at
46.19. I place a stop
at 48.04 and a target
of 42.49. On July 13,
my position is up by
4 percent, so I move
my stop up to the 21-
period EMA, which



==================================================
                    PAGE 3258

2. On July 14, KLAC
gaps down and opens
through my target.
I’m filled at the open
at 41.61, 88 cents
better than my target,
for a nice gain.
KLAC is still trading
below its 8- and 21-
period EMAs, so I set
up my next short,
which would be a

                    PAGE 3261

rally back to its 8-
period EMA.
3. On July 20, the
market rallies back to
the 8-period EMA,
and I’m filled at
41.81. My stop is
43.48, and my target
is 38.47. On July 22,
the stock is up by 4
percent from my
entry, so I move my
stop down to the 21-

period EMA, which
is 42.84.
4. On July 26, my target
is hit, and I’m out for
an 8 percent gain. I
start looking to short
again at the next rally
back to the 8-period
EMA.
5. On July 29, I’m back
in short at 39.33. I
place a stop at 40.90,
and my target is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3263                     
==================================================

36.18.
6. The next day, KLAC
gaps up on positive
news and rallies to
my stop. I’m out for a
4 percent loss. I note
that the 8-period
EMA has not crossed
above the 21-period
EMA. I sit back and
wait, because if
KLAC trades and
closes back below its

8-period EMA, I will
set up an order to
short the next rally
back to its 8-period
EMA.
7. A few days later, on
August 3, KLAC
closes below its 8-
period EMA. I set up
an order to short a
rally back to its 8-
period EMA, and on
August 4, I am filled

                    PAGE 3265                     
==================================================

at 39.93. I place a
stop at 41.53 and a
target at 36.74. The
stock pushes higher,
and on August 5 it
comes within spitting
distance of my stop,
but it doesn’t make it
and closes well off its
highs.
8. On August 10, I have
a 4 percent gain
registered, so I move



==================================================
                    PAGE 3266                     
==================================================

my stop down to the
21-period EMA,
which is 40.29. On
August 11, KLAC
gaps lower and
pushes lower all day,
hitting my target.
9. KLAC is still
trending lower
according to the 8-
and 21-period EMAs,
so I set up another
order to short a rally



==================================================
                    PAGE 3267                     
==================================================

to the 8-period EMA.
On August 17,
KLAC rallies, and I
am filled at 37.15. I
place a target at 34.18
and a stop at 38.64.
10. The market chops
back and forth for a
while, and on
September 1, I am
stopped out for a 4
percent loss.

QLGC (QLogic Corp)—June
14, 2004
1. On June 14, 2004, the
8-period EMA on
QLGC crosses below
the 21-period EMA,
setting up a situation
in which I can start
taking new plays (see
Figure 22.8). I place
an order the next day
to short a rally back
up to the 8-period



==================================================
                    PAGE 3269                     
==================================================

EMA, and I’m filled
at 28.14. I place a
stop at 29.27 and a
target at 25.89.

==================================================

Figure 22.8
2. On June 16, QLGC
dry heaves and pukes
for a nice down day.
It gets close to my
target, but not quite.
Since I’m up more
than 4 percent on the
play, I move down
my stop to the 21-
period EMA, which
is 28.22. The very
next day, my target is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3272                     
==================================================

hit at 25.89. I’m now
flat on QLGC, and I
begin looking at new
entries. A new entry,
of course, would
mean a rally back to
the 8-period EMA.
3. I place my order and
am filled on June 22
at 26.68. I place a
target at 24.55 and a
stop at 27.75.
4. QLGC continues to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3273                     
==================================================

rally, and on June 25,
I’m stopped out for a
4 percent loss.
5. The day after I’m
stopped, QLGC
moves back below its
8-period EMA and
closes below it. This
is the trigger I’m
looking for before I
set up my next trade.
I need to see a close
back below the 8-



==================================================
                    PAGE 3274                     
==================================================

period EMA in order
to start setting up
orders for a new short
position. The next
day I set up an order
to short a rally back
to the 8-period EMA,
and I’m filled on
June 28 at 26.86. My
stop is 27.93, and my
target is 24.71.
QLGC starts moving
my way, and on July
1 I am up by more



==================================================
                    PAGE 3275                     
==================================================

than 4 percent on this
position. At this
point, I move up my
stop and start using
the 21-period EMA
as a trailing stop,
starting with 27.12.
6. QLGC continues to
bleed like a stuck pig,
and on July 6, I am
out at my target. I set
up an order to short a
rally back to the 8-



==================================================
                    PAGE 3276                     
==================================================

period EMA.
7. On July 9, my order
is hit, and I’m short
at 25.85. I place a
stop at 26.88 and a
target at 23.78. On
July 14, QLGC
comes close to my
target, but “close”
works only when you
are throwing a
grenade. My target
isn’t hit, but I do



==================================================
                    PAGE 3277                     
==================================================

move my stop down
to the 21-period
EMA, which is
26.03.
8. The next day QLGC
moves higher, and
I’m stopped out for a
loss of 18 cents. One
question I usually get
in a situation like this
is, “Hey, since the
stock was so close to
your target, why



==================================================
                    PAGE 3278                     
==================================================

didn’t you just take
the profit?” The main
reason I don’t is that
if I bring that “human
judgment” into the
equation, two things
happen. First, instead
of this being a
relaxed system to
trade, it now becomes
an intense system
because you have to
watch the moves
closely on an intraday



==================================================
                    PAGE 3279                     
==================================================

basis in order to
decide when to get
out. Second, I’ve
found that most
traders, when they
are in a trade, lose all
objectivity. By
actively managing
this trade, many
people will close it
out as soon as it starts
to go against them, or
they’ll start taking
profits too soon. In



==================================================
                    PAGE 3280                     
==================================================

this respect, you
might as well be day
trading without a
plan, which is the
most common reason
traders lose money.
Choose your setup,
choose your
parameters, and stick
to them! How can
you measure the
effectiveness of a
system unless you
stick with the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3281                     
==================================================

parameters?
9. On July 16, QLGC
closes back below its
8-period EMA, so I
set up another order
to short. I’m filled on
July 20 at 25.10. My
stop is 26.10, and my
target is 23.09.
10. QLGC bleeds lower,
and my target is filled
on July 28.
Remember, once I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3282                     
==================================================

am up by 4 percent in
the position, I start
using the 21-period
EMA as a trailing
stop.
11. On July 29, QLGC
bounces back up to
its 8-period EMA,
and I’m filled on a
short at 24.09. My
target is 22.16, and
my stop is 25.05. On
August 5, I am up by



==================================================
                    PAGE 3283                     
==================================================

4 percent in the
position, so I move
my stop down to the
21-period EMA,
which is 24.23.
12. On August 12, my
target is hit, and I’m
out for an 8 percent
gain.
CEPH (Cephalon, Inc.)—
May 3, 2004
1. On May 3, 2004, the

                    PAGE 3284                     
==================================================

8-period EMA on
CEPH crosses below
the 21-period EMA
(see Figure 22.9). I
set up an order to
short the next rally
back up to the 8-
period EMA. On
May 5, my entry is
hit at 57.42. My
target is 52.83, and
my stop is 59.72.



==================================================

Figure 22.9
2. On May 7, in addition
to celebrating my
birthday (after you
turn 21, what’s the
point?), CEPH moves
down by more than 4
percent, so I adjust
my stop to the 21-
period EMA, which
is 57.30. This now
becomes a trailing
stop that I update at

                    PAGE 3287                     
==================================================

the end of each
trading day.
3. On May 19, my target
is hit. This is a pretty
typical swing trade,
where I’m in the
position for a little
more than two weeks,
and my daily
management of the
trade is at the
absolute minimum so
that I can focus on



==================================================
                    PAGE 3288                     
==================================================

other things. A pure
day trader who was
flipping into and out
of CEPH during this
time could have
easily done 30 trades
and had nothing to
show for it except a
pile of commission
costs.
SBUX (Starbucks Corp.)—

1. As long as there are
day traders,
Starbucks will be
able to charge as
much as it wants for a
cup of coffee. There
is no bid and ask
when it comes to a
Grande Latte. Traders
will take that one “at
the market.” On May
24, 2004, SBUX has
its 8-period EMA
cross up above its 21-

period EMA (see
Figure 22.10). This is
my signal to set up a
bid to buy the next
pullback to the 8-
period EMA. On
May 25, my order is
hit, and I’m filled at
38.64. I place a stop
at 37.09, and my
target is 41.73.
2. On May 27, SBUX
moves up by 4

                    PAGE 3291                     
==================================================

percent from my
entry, so I move my
stop up, using a
trailing 21-period
EMA. My stop on
this day is moved up
to 38.71. The stock
continues to push
higher, and on June 3
my target is hit. I
start to set up my
next bid on a
pullback to the 8-
period EMA.

3. On June 14, SBUX
pulls back, and I am
filled at 41.96. My
stop is 40.28, and my
target is 45.32. The
stock grinds higher
from this point, and
on June 18 it hits my
4 percent watermark.
I tighten my stop,
using the 21-period
EMA as my

                    PAGE 3294                     
==================================================

guideline. My new
stop is 41.51. On
June 25 and June 30,
the stock pulls back
very close to the 21-
period EMA, and
obviously very close
to my stop. However,
it doesn’t hit, and I’m
still in the trade.
4. On July 2, SBUX
firms, and my target
is hit for a gain of

GS (The Goldman Sachs

2004
1. On August 24, 2004,

(see Figure 22.11). I
start setting up bids
to buy the next
pullback to the 8-

2. On September 7, this
position is up by 4
percent from my

stop to reflect the
current position of

3. I update and change
my stop at the end of

                    PAGE 3299                     
==================================================

the movement in the
21-period EMA. GS
pulls back and hits its
21-period EMA nine
trading days after I
start using the trailing
stop. I am out at
91.05 for a gain of
3.30, or 3.76 percent.
This is another good
example of a low-
maintenance trade
that lasts the better
part of a month. This



==================================================
                    PAGE 3300                     
==================================================

is a very manageable
type of trade for
people who work full
time. I should know,
because these are the
main types of trades I
did when I was doing
my stint in the
corporate world.
PSFT (PeopleSoft, Inc.)—
August 27, 2004
1. I like this example



==================================================
                    PAGE 3301                     
==================================================

because this does
tend to happen more
often than you would
think. This setup
keeps you in the
direction of the most
recent order flow.
Typically, when
stocks come out with
really good news or
really bad news, there
are always people “in
the know” who get
positioned for these



==================================================
                    PAGE 3302                     
==================================================

moves before the
news is released. This
pushes the stock
higher (for good
news) or lower (for
bad news) before the
story hits the wire,
since these insiders
load up or dump
shares. When the
news hits, they get
out—and often I can
too, because I’m
following these



==================================================
                    PAGE 3303                     
==================================================

setups. With PSFT,
the 8-period EMA
crosses the 21-period
EMA on August 25,
2004 (see Figure
22.12). I set up an
order to buy the first
pullback to the 8-
period EMA. On
August 27, PSFT
pulls back, and I am
filled at 17.11. My
stop is 16.43, and my
target is 18.47. On

target is hit, and I set
up an order to buy
the first pullback to

3. The pullback actually
occurs on this very
same day, and I’m
filled at 17.62. I place
a stop at 16.92, and
my target is 19.03.

4. The stock doesn’t do
a whole lot for the
next three trading
days, but on the
fourth day it gaps
higher on the ORCL
(Oracle Corp.)
takeover news and
opens at 19.97, 94
cents above my
target. I’m out for a
13.34 percent gain.
Although I had no
clue that this would

                    PAGE 3308

be announced, I did
know that the order
flow on the stock was
positive based on this
particular setup, so
the odds were in my
favor that the path of
least resistance would
be higher.

==================================================

==================================================

hyped stocks of 2004,
and using this setup, I
was able to catch a
few of the moves. On
August 13, 2004, the
8-period EMA
crosses up and
through the 21-period
EMA (see Figure
22.13). Once this
happens, I set up an
order to buy the next
pullback to the 8-
period EMA. A few

at 29.08 and a target
at 32.71.

2. TZOO ramps higher
soon after I enter the
stock, and my target
is hit later that same
day. Once I am out, I
place another order to
buy a pullback to the
8-period EMA.
3. On August 24, the
pullback occurs, and
I am filled at 37.03. I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3313                     
==================================================

set my target at 39.99
and my stop at 35.55.
4. Similar to my last
trade, TZOO ramps
up, and my target is
hit the very same day.
Like a robot, I set up
an order to buy the
next pullback to the
8-period EMA.
5. On August 30, I had a
bid set at 40.81. The
stock gapped below



==================================================
                    PAGE 3314                     
==================================================

this level and opened
at 39.24, where I was
filled. This is a good
example of what I do
in this type of
situation, because I
place my orders
before the market
opens and don’t wait
and try to finesse my
entry after the market
opens. When you
have a limit order in
place and the stock



==================================================
                    PAGE 3315                     
==================================================

opens below that
level, then your order
becomes a market
order because it is “at
this price or better.”
However, I will
update my stop and
my target based on
my actual entry price.
In this case, my entry
price was 39.24, so I
use a stop that is 4
percent lower than
this price, which is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3316                     
==================================================

37.67, and a target
that is 8 percent
higher than this price,
which is 42.38.
6. On August 31, the
very next trading day,
my target is hit. I
know what I’m going
to do now—I’m
going to bid for the
next pullback to the
8-period EMA. It’s
like kissing your



==================================================
                    PAGE 3317                     
==================================================

spouse goodbye
when you leave for
work in the morning;
after a while it’s
automatic and you
don’t have to think
about it.
7. On September 2, I’m
filled at 42.36, and I
set my stop at 40.67
and my target at
45.75.
8. A few days later, my



==================================================
                    PAGE 3318

target is hit. It’s time
to buy the next
pullback.
9. The market pulls
back many times, but
never quite to the 8-
period EMA until
September 20, where
I’m filled at 66.34. I
place a stop at 63.69,
and my target is
71.65.
10. My target is hit the

very same day.
SNDK (Sandisk Corp)—
August 31, 2004
1. On August 31, 2004,
I buy a pullback to
the 8-period EMA on
SNDK, and I’m filled
at 23.30 (see Figure
22.14). I place a stop
at 22.37 and a target
of 25.16. On
September 8, SNDK



==================================================
                    PAGE 3320                     
==================================================

gets close to my stop
and closes near the
lows. After I see this,
I assume that I’m
going to get stopped
out the next day, but
the important thing is
that I do not alter my
parameters. It doesn’t
matter what I think,
as long as I don’t
touch the parameters!

2. Two days later, the
stock has reversed,
and I’m out at my
target on September
10. It’s time to set up
my next bid to buy
SNDK on a pullback
to the 8-period EMA.
3. I trail up my bid, and
it’s almost hit on
September 20 and

again on September
24, but close enough
doesn’t cut it. I don’t
get filled again on
this play during this
time frame.
Updates to the Propulsion
Plays
This chapter hasn’t changed
much since I wrote it for the
first edition. However, I did
want to include a few



==================================================
                    PAGE 3326                     
==================================================

updated charts that tie in a
couple of things that I
introduced earlier in the
book. Figure 22.15 shows a
chart of the E-mini S&P 500
during the first half of 2011.
At point 1, we get a clean
8/21-period EMA cross to
the upside, and we have a
great opportunity to buy a
pullback, just as the setup
indicates. However, this
chart also has the TTM trend.
As long as the bars stay light

                    PAGE 3327                     
==================================================

gray in color, it indicates
buying pressure, and there is
no reason to exit the trade
until there are two black bars
in a row. This is great
because it can keep a trader
in a trend “as long as it is
willing to trend.” Then, at
point 2, as the 8/21-period
EMA cross is crossing to the
downside, a squeeze is also
forming at point 3. Bonus!
Here a trader can use the
concepts discussed in



==================================================
                    PAGE 3328                     
==================================================

Chapter 11 to get into this
trade early and be positioned
for the potentially explosive
move.
Figure 22.16 is a daily
chart of CMG (Chipotle
Mexican Grill Inc.), a stock
that has confounded shorts
for much of its run. In this
chart, I’ve also added the C
wave from Chapter 12. At
point 1, we have a squeeze
combined with an 8/21-



==================================================
                    PAGE 3329                     
==================================================

period EMA cross. As the
stock starts moving higher,
we can take off a portion of
the trade, and then trail the
21-period EMA as a stop.
Depending on a trader’s
intestinal fortitude, a trader
could have a enjoyed a
massive run on this move,
until CMG pushed below its
21-period EMA. What gets
interesting is at point 2,
where the 8/21-period EMA
crosses to the downside. Is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3330                     
==================================================

this a trade that’s worth
taking? Well, if we look at
the C wave, we can clearly
see that it is above zero,
indicating that the longer-
term trend on this stock is
higher. We can certainly take
a short trade here, but at least
the C wave is giving us a
heads-up that the easier
money is on the long side. In
this case, it pays to just wait
for the next long signal, and
a squeeze with an 8/21-



==================================================
                    PAGE 3331

point 3.

Summing Up the
Propulsion Plays
There are two main things



==================================================
                    PAGE 3334                     
==================================================

that I like about the
propulsion play. First, I don’t
have to watch the markets all
day in order to get my entry.
I can set up the orders the
night before and then check
at the end of the day to see
which of my orders got
filled. Second, these plays
have specific targets. I’ve
tried this method by just
using trailing stops, but the
results were not as good.
Sure, once in a while I would



==================================================
                    PAGE 3335                     
==================================================

catch a stock that would have
a parabolic move, but more
often than not, a perfectly
nice profit would roll back
over into a breakeven trade.
Through trial and error, I
have found that by setting a
firm 8 percent target using a
GTC (good till canceled)
order, my profitability
improved. (Note: if you are
using this with a squeeze and
a TTM trend, you can also
use 8 percent on the first half



==================================================
                    PAGE 3336                     
==================================================

of your position, then move
your stop to breakeven and
utilize the TTM trend to
manage the rest of your
position.) Remember, you
don’t want to become one of
the many brokerage clients
that the staff people poke fun
at. They call GTC orders
“good till close,” because
any time the stock gets close
to the client’s target, the
client calls up and cancels
the order “because it looks



==================================================
                    PAGE 3337                     
==================================================

like it will go even higher.”
Of course, most of these
stocks end up heading back
lower and getting sold for a
loss. Establish the
parameters, then treat your
parameters like good
employees and let them do
their job. Have a plan and
follow it. Want to get out of
half at 8 percent? Great.
Don’t change your plan once
you’ve decided on your
course of action.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3338                     
==================================================

In terms of actual
execution of these plays
through your broker, here are
two additional tips. First, it
helps to “drill down” and
watch the daily EMAs update
in real time throughout the
day. You can do this by
overlaying the daily EMAs
on a 15-minute chart. To do
this in TradeStation, set up a
15-minute chart and then do
the math. Take the 6.5 hours
in the regular stock session,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3339                     
==================================================

which equates to twenty-six
15-minute bars. 26 periods ×
8 EMA = 208, and 26
periods × 21 EMA = 546.
These 208-period and 546-
period EMAs on a 15-minute
chart mimic the 8-period and
21-period EMAs on a daily
chart. You can adjust this to
include the pre- and
postmarket sessions if you
like. By watching the
intraday charts with the daily
EMAs overlaid, a trader can



==================================================
                    PAGE 3340                     
==================================================

really keep an eye on when
the cross is taking place and
where to place the orders.
Second, as with the pivots, I
think it is helpful to get “just
in front of” the moving
averages. For example, if the
8-period EMA is at 43.40
and you are trying to buy a
pullback, then place a limit
order 10 to 15 cents higher,
say 43.52, in order to get
filled. When the setup is
there, don’t make the mistake



==================================================
                    PAGE 3341                     
==================================================

of tripping over pennies
when your aim is to be
picking up dollars.

Check, to Understand What
the Market Is
Going to Do in the Future,
It Helps to Understand Its
Past
Although I base many of my
daily trading decisions on
specific setups, I also like to
analyze how the market has
recently been behaving. My
goal in doing this is to be
constantly aware of the path
of least resistance, since I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3349                     
==================================================

want to set up the bulk of my
trades directly along that
path. To that end, I have
developed a quick daily
checklist and, for Sundays, a
more detailed and thorough
checklist. The purpose of this
is to prepare myself mentally
for the trading day ahead.
There will be times when my
analysis is totally off, but
I’ve found that the act of
mentally reviewing potential
scenarios before the opening



==================================================
                    PAGE 3350                     
==================================================

bell prepares me for just
about anything. The market
can be easy to trade when the
going is smooth, but there are
plenty of times when the
market will throw a curve
ball. In these situations, it’s
the prepared traders who
consistently come out on top.
The first thing I do in this
regard is to look at the
markets I’m trading from a
top-down approach, starting



==================================================
                    PAGE 3351                     
==================================================

with the monthly charts and
working my way down to the
60-minute charts. In this
example, I analyze the S&P
500, but I do this with every
market that I’m following. I
like to do this with the main
indicators that I like to
watch, including the squeeze,
reversion bands, waves, key
moving averages, and so on.
For purposes of illustration,
all the charts I’m looking at
here have the following



==================================================
                    PAGE 3352                     
==================================================

indicators placed on them:
1. The 8-, 21-, and 200-
period exponential
moving averages
(EMA). In the charts
shown in the pages
that follow, the 8-
period EMA is the
thinnest line, and the
200-period EMA is
the thickest line. I
will also look at the
50- and 100-period



==================================================
                    PAGE 3353                     
==================================================

EMAs, but they
aren’t as important to
me.
2. A slow stochastic
with the default
TradeStation settings
of 14, 3, 3.
3. A MACD with the
default TradeStation
settings of 12, 26, 9.
4. A TTM squeeze
indicator—this is the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3354                     
==================================================

same indicator
discussed in Chapter
11. Of course, you
can also include
waves, reversion
bands, and other
indicators on these
charts. To keep this
discussion simple,
I’m going to keep the
charts simple.
Monthly Chart Analysis



==================================================
                    PAGE 3355                     
==================================================

I always like to start off with
the monthly charts. Even
though I’m going to be doing
most of my trading in the
futures market, for the stock
indexes, I will look at the
monthly charts of the cash
index. This is because there
is much more history here to
view, as the cash index has
been around a lot longer than
the stock index futures
contracts.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3356                     
==================================================

The first things I look at
are the stochastic and MACD
readings. These represent
“pressures” on the market. Is
the pressure more to the
upside (buying pressure) or
to the downside (selling
pressure)? In general, I want
to establish positions that are
on the same side as the
current dominant pressures in
the market I am trading. My
rule of thumb for this is as
follows:



==================================================
                    PAGE 3357                     
==================================================

The stochastic
is the heads-
up, and the
MACD is the
confirmation.
This brings me to why I
place little value on whether
a stochastic is overbought or
oversold. According to the
stochastics in Figure 23.1,
the S&P was overbought
starting in the middle of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3358                     
==================================================

1995, and it stayed
overbought until the middle
of 1998—three long years.
During that time this
“overbought” market rallied
by more than 100 percent. To
me, an overbought stochastic
is actually a bullish sign—if
the MACD is also in a buy.
This brings me to my next
guideline:
What I’m



==================================================
                    PAGE 3359                     
==================================================

looking for is
MACD
crossovers.
The stochastics are
valuable in that they will turn
first, and therefore they can
give me a heads-up that a
MACD cross might occur.
That said, I don’t act on this
information unless and until
a MACD crossover actually
does occur.
At point 1 in Figure 23.1,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3360                     
==================================================

the monthly MACD crossed
over into a sell signal in May
2000, about two months after
the stochastics crossed into a
sell. Once this happened, the
path of least resistance on the
monthly S&P chart officially
switched from higher to
lower. This means that, for
longer-term swing and
position trades, I would start
spending more time focusing
on short setups and generally
ignore long setups. I would



==================================================
                    PAGE 3361                     
==================================================

do this until the monthly
MACD went back into a
crossover buy, and that
happened at point 2, nearly
three years later. Once this
occurred, I started focusing
more on long swing-trading
setups and generally ignored
most short trading setups.
Remember, I’m talking about
swing and position trades
here, not day trades.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3362                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 3363                     
==================================================

Figure 23.1
The snapshot of this chart
was taken on April 5, 2005.
At point 3, I can see that the
stochastics are trying to roll
over into a sell. What does
this mean to me? It means
that, potentially, the MACD
could roll over into a sell.
However, at point 4 we can
see that the MACD is still in
a buy. For me, this means
that, for longer-term swing



==================================================
                    PAGE 3364                     
==================================================

and position plays, I will still
continue to focus on the long
side until the monthly MACD
rolls over into a sell.
The next thing I like to
look at is the key moving
averages. First, I will look at
the 200-period EMA just to
see where it is in relation to
the current market prices.
This is the strongest moving
average, and it represents
serious support or resistance



==================================================
                    PAGE 3365                     
==================================================

—it was enough to stop the
crash of 2000, as seen at
point 5. In this current
snapshot of the S&P, the
200-period EMA is way
down at 849.60 and isn’t
much of a factor in the
current market conditions.
However, the fact that the
market is trading above this
level is bullish.
What is more relevant in
the short term is the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3366                     
==================================================

relationship between the 8-
and 21-period EMAs. The
first thing I’m looking for is
to see which moving average
is on top of the other. If the
8-period EMA is on top of
the 21-period EMA, this
shows that the path of least
resistance is higher. If the 8-
period EMA is trading below
the 21-period EMA, this
shows that the path of least
resistance is lower. This
crossover is a confirming



==================================================
                    PAGE 3367                     
==================================================

indicator for the MACD, as
the MACD will fire off
faster. I like to use these
moving averages in my
entries. In this regard, I will
use these moving averages
on the monthly charts in the
same way as I described for
the daily charts in Chapter
22, where I will buy
pullbacks or short rallies to
the 8-period EMA. In this
current chart, at point 6, I can
see that the S&Ps are trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 3368                     
==================================================

right at their 8-period EMA.
Since the 8-period EMA is
trading above the 21-period
EMA, this is a buy zone.
I also like to look at where
the 50- and 100-period
EMAs are located, but I
don’t place as much
importance on them in terms
of establishing a trade. I will
use these more as targets
than as entry points.
The last thing I look at is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3369                     
==================================================

the squeeze. Most of the
time, the squeeze is not doing
anything, so I just glance at it
to see if it is in the process of
setting up a move. However,
when it does fire off, as it did
at point 8, this takes
precedence over everything
else. When the squeeze is on,
then I’m in this trade until
the squeeze is no longer
valid. At point 7, you can see
that a long squeeze occurred
in early 1995. This signal



==================================================
                    PAGE 3370                     
==================================================

fired off at the beginning
stages of one of the strongest
and most enduring rallies the
S&P has ever seen. To that
end, I like to know when a
squeeze is in play. I never
fight the squeeze.
For this current chart,
there isn’t a squeeze play that
has fired off or is even
developing. Monthly
squeezes are a rare
occurrence, with only two of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3371                     
==================================================

them in the last 10 years.
Weekly Chart Analysis
Once I am done with the
monthly chart, I take a quick
glance at the weekly chart
(see Figure 23.2). Note that
here I have switched back to
the ES futures contract,
because with the weekly ES
chart, there is enough data to
get accurate information
going back a few years. All

Figure 23.2
We can see at this point
that the weekly chart has
been in a MACD sell for
about a month, and during
this time, the S&P has fallen
by about 60 points. The
stochastics at point 3 have
taken it on the chin and are
oversold. Remember,
however, that I couldn’t care
less about that. What I’m
interested in is the weekly



==================================================
                    PAGE 3375                     
==================================================

MACD at point 2. Is it
turning higher? No, it is still
in a sell. In addition, the
squeeze at point 3 has three
black dots. This is not a
signal, but it is a heads-up
that a squeeze is in progress,
and I want to pay attention to
the direction in which this
eventually fires off. Finally, I
look at the moving averages
at point 4, and I can see that
the 8-period EMA has
crossed below the 21-period



==================================================
                    PAGE 3376                     
==================================================

EMA, a bearish
development. We are right at
the 21-period EMA.
What to do here? This is
what I call a mixed market.
The monthly chart is bullish,
and the weekly chart is
bearish. In this situation, the
sell signals on the weekly
chart will create buying
opportunities on the monthly
chart. This is an important
distinction to understand.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3377                     
==================================================

Just because the weekly chart
is in a sell doesn’t mean that
the world is coming to an
end. Yes, it absolutely
creates shorting
opportunities, but the
monthly charts are still
indicating a buy, and this
means that the longer-term
path of least resistance is
higher. I want to point this
out because this type of
situation typically creates
many bears and many



==================================================
                    PAGE 3378                     
==================================================

negative attitudes, since a
weekly sell signal can
generate a devastating
beating for bulls. But, in the
bigger scope of things, I’m
looking for the weekly chart
to turn higher and move back
in line with the monthly
chart. The best trading
opportunities occur when the
weekly charts line back up
with the monthly charts.
For setups, the weekly



==================================================
                    PAGE 3379                     
==================================================

chart is still in a sell,
meaning that short setups are
appropriate. However, before
I set anything up, I would
want to first look at the daily
charts to see if the pressures
on this time frame are lower
or higher.
Daily Chart Analysis
Although I will use the
monthly and weekly charts to
help me determine the path



==================================================
                    PAGE 3380                     
==================================================

of least resistance for swing
and position trades, it is the
daily chart that I drill down
to in order to get my specific
entry levels. Figure 23.3
shows the daily chart of the
S&Ps, and now it is time for
me to set up a trade. The first
thing I notice is that the
stochastics at point 1 are
turning higher. I then, of
course, look to the MACD at
point 2 to see what it is
doing, and it is also trying to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3381                     
==================================================

turn higher, although it
hasn’t quite done it yet. At
point 3, I see that the S&Ps
have held a test of support at
the 200-period EMA.
However, at point 4, the 8-
period EMA is trading below
the 21-period EMA, which is
negative. The squeeze also
doesn’t help me out because
there aren’t any signals on it
at this time.
Okay, so now I have a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3382                     
==================================================

bullish monthly chart, a
bearish weekly chart, and a
bearish daily chart that is
trying to turn bullish. Can I
do anything with this? There
really isn’t a clear answer
here. It’s time to keep on
drilling down. Let’s visit the
60-minute chart.

Figure 23.3
60-Minute Chart Analysis
The 60-minute chart reveals
a bullish stochastic at point 1,
and when I check the MACD
at point 2, I can see that the
MACD is also pointing
higher, which is bullish (see
Figure 23.4). In looking at
the moving averages at point
3, I can see that the 8-period
EMA is trading above the

                    PAGE 3385                     
==================================================

21-period EMA, which is
bullish, but the market is
below its 200-period EMA,
which is bearish. Is there a
trade here? Take a moment
before reading on and figure
out what you would do in
this situation. I want you to
take a trade based on what
we’ve just talked about.
Would you go long or short?
What’s your entry level?
What’s your stop? What’s
your target? Spend a few

==================================================

minutes on this before
moving on to the next
paragraph.
Today is Tuesday, April
5, 2005. Here is what I’m
going to set up for tomorrow,
Wednesday, April 6, 2005.
I’m going to set up a buy
order at 1183.50, right above
the 8-period EMA. Since this
is a 60-minute chart, I’m
going to use a target of ½ of
1 percent, which is 5.9175. I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3387                     
==================================================

will round this up to 6.00,
which would make the target
1189.50. This is right below
the 200-period EMA, which
is a good place for a target. If
the 200-period EMA had
been below my target, then I
would not take the trade. My
stop will be 2.95875 (¼ of 1
percent), which I will round
up to 3.00. This makes my
stop 1180.50. This is just
below the 21-period EMA. If
we get up ¼ of 1 percent in



==================================================
                    PAGE 3388                     
==================================================

the play (three points to
1186.50), I will move my
stop up to the 21-period
EMA and trail it from there.
If this looks familiar, this is
the propulsion play described
in Chapter 22.
For my swing plays, I
want to play them in the
direction of the path of least
resistance according to the
MACD. The monthly charts
are higher, and the daily



==================================================
                    PAGE 3389                     
==================================================

chart is about to turn higher.
Two of the three time frames
are pointing higher. Then
when I drill down to the 60-
minute chart, I see one of the
setups that I utilize staring
me right in the face, so I set
it up. It’s as simple as that.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3390

==================================================

Figure 23.4
However, before we get
too excited about a potential
play, let’s double-check the
path of least resistance by
looking at two more charts.
Daily RSI Chart Analysis
While the previous charts
give me an idea of the overall
buying or selling pressure
and give me an indication of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3392                     
==================================================

key levels that I need to be
watching out for during the
next trading day, there is still
a piece missing. What I want
to see next is whether there
are any bullish or bearish
divergences in the seven-
period relative strength index
(RSI). These are a heads-up
for a pending market
reversal.
In Figure 23.5, we can see
that at point 1 at the top of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3393                     
==================================================

the chart, the S&P made a
nice rally into the end of
2004. However, if we look at
point 1 at the bottom of the
chart, we can see that the
seven-period RSI was
making lower lows, while the
S&P was making higher
highs. This is a massive
bearish divergence;
essentially, it is a heads-up
that the current rally is not
going to last.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3394                     
==================================================

That’s great, but how does
a person enter that trade?
That is a great question.
Think a minute before you
go on to the next paragraph
and decide what you would
do in this situation with the
tools you’ve learned so far in
this book. The market is
rallying, but there is a bearish
divergence. I’m looking for
the market to fall—how do I
enter?



==================================================
                    PAGE 3395                     
==================================================

There are a couple of
different ways to enter. Plays
described in this book that
have worked well in this
situation are discussed in
Chapters 14 (Scalper Buys
and Sells), 15 (Bricks), 19
(HOLP and LOHP), and 22
(Propulsion Plays). This
comes back to the
fundamental basis of my
whole trading plan: even if I
feel 100 percent sure that the
market is going to roll over, I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3396                     
==================================================

will not establish a short
position until one of my
setups generates a short
signal.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3397

                    PAGE 3398                     
==================================================

Figure 23.5
Now if we go to point 2 in
the upper right-hand portion
of the chart, we can see that
prices made lower lows.
Then if we look at point 2 in
the lower right-hand portion
of the chart, we can see that
the RSI made higher lows,
creating a bullish divergence.
This sets up a potential
reversal in the markets,
meaning that I want to focus



==================================================
                    PAGE 3399                     
==================================================

on the long side. This
confirms that the play we just
set up in the last section with
the 60-minute charts is the
right way to go.
60-Minute RSI Chart
Analysis
On this 60-minute chart (see
Figure 23.6), there are two
bullish divergences in place
within the current market
action. I’ve marked one of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3400                     
==================================================

them—can you find the other
one?
The one I’ve marked
shows the RSI making higher
highs, yet prices have not
made higher highs. This is
bullish. The RSI is
essentially leading the
market higher. The second
divergence takes place when
the ES made lower lows on
April 1, yet the RSI made
higher lows. This is a bullish



==================================================
                    PAGE 3401                     
==================================================

divergence and is also
positive. After looking at
both these RSI charts, we can
clearly see that the long side
is the path of least resistance
in the short term.

if news about oil hits

your favor, not about getting
guarantees.

==================================================

Looking at one index in a
couple of different time
frames can be a handful to
track. But what happens if
you are looking at all these
different charts and time
frames for three or four
different indexes, a couple of
sectors, and a handful of
stocks? It can get confusing.
However, knowing what’s
going on across multiple
trading instruments and
multiple time frames gives a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3405                     
==================================================

trader a much better feel for
the overall markets. To that
end, I’ve put together the
following table to help me
keep it all straight (see
Figure 23.7).
This table gives me the
opportunity to write down
my chart interpretations in an
easy-to-read, take-it-all-in-at-
a-glance worksheet. With the
key indexes that I’m viewing
on the far left, I can then go



==================================================
                    PAGE 3406                     
==================================================

through the stochastics,
MACD, RSI, and the squeeze
on all the different indexes in
all the different time frames.
For stochastics and MACD, I
have M, W, and D as
headings for the monthly
chart, the weekly chart, and
the daily chart. For the RSI
and the squeeze I have W, D,
and S as headings for the
weekly chart, the daily chart,
and the sixty-minute chart. I
can then go through and see



==================================================
                    PAGE 3407                     
==================================================

at a glance that the monthly
and daily MACDs are in
buys across the board, and
that the 60-minute RSIs are
also in buys (as they are
showing bullish
divergences), as are some of
the daily RSIs. For the
squeezes, I have N, R, S, and
B, representing neutral, red
dot, sell, and buy. Neutral
just means that there
currently isn’t a signal in
place, nor is a squeeze even



==================================================
                    PAGE 3408                     
==================================================

in a heads-up. The red dot
(which is the black dot in this
book because the charts are
black and white) means that
a squeeze play is setting up,
but it hasn’t yet fired.
Whenever I see a market that
is in R mode, I start paying
close attention because I
want to see when it fires off.
Finally, after it does fire off,
if it’s a long squeeze, that is a
B for buy, and if it is a short
squeeze, that is an S for sell.

==================================================

Figure 23.7
This may seem like a lot
of work, but it doesn’t take
long to do. The monthly and
weekly charts do not change
very often—most of the
attention is spent on the daily
and 60-minute charts. I
update this table each
evening after the stock
markets are closed, and I post
the results in my daily
newsletters. One of the

==================================================

reasons I started sending out
newsletters in 1999 was that
it forced me to keep these
tables updated each and
every day, no matter what
else was going on in my life.
By having everything in
place, I can see when one
index is breaking down
before all the others, as the
Nasdaq did in early 2005.
When one index starts to
buck an overall trend, that is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3412                     
==================================================

a heads-up that the rest are
setting up to roll over as
well.
Sectors and Key Stocks
Radar Screen Alert
This radar screen alert is the
same as that for the indexes,
except that it will have key
sectors and key stocks that
I’m watching (see Figure
23.8). It is set up in just the
same way and works in just



==================================================
                    PAGE 3413                     
==================================================

the same way. When markets
turn, you can see it first in
the key sectors and stocks
that make up the index. Also,
if I’m looking for trading
ideas and I see that the
semiconductors, for example,
have just fired off a short
squeeze, it is fairly easy to
figure out where I should go
looking for short plays.

who want to prepare these

The Key to Reading Daily



==================================================
                    PAGE 3416                     
==================================================

Volume
I like to watch the daily
volume in the cash indexes to
see how much activity there
is going on behind the
moves. Each day I take the
volume and key it into an
Excel spreadsheet like the
one shown in Figure 23.9.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3417

==================================================
                    PAGE 3418                     
==================================================

What I’m looking for is
the strength or lack of
strength behind the move. If
the markets push higher, I’ve
got to see two things in order
to validate the move: first,
the volume has to be greater
than it was the day before,
and second, the volume has
to be greater than the 50-day
average volume. The bigger
the difference in these
numbers, the better the odds
that the move is the real deal



==================================================
                    PAGE 3419                     
==================================================

and the start of something
big. Conversely, if the
markets have a big day to the
upside, but the volume is
lighter than that of the
previous day and lighter than
the 50-day average volume,
then I have more trouble
believing in the move. The
lower the actual volume in
relation to these other
numbers, the greater the
chance that the move was a
mere probe and is going to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3420                     
==================================================

reverse violently at the drop
of a hat.
Think of it this way—a
car that is going uphill on a
full tank of gas has a much
better shot at making it than a
car that is running on fumes.
High-volume days show the
markets riding on a full tank
of gas, while low-volume
days show the markets riding
on fumes.
The Key Price Levels to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3421                     
==================================================

Know Each and Every
Trading Day
There is a specific set of
numbers that I want to be
aware of every day, because
these are critical in helping
me to establish trades and
stay on the right side of the
market (see Figure 23.10).
I like to follow most of
these price levels in the S&P
futures, just because it is the
biggest and broadest index



==================================================
                    PAGE 3422                     
==================================================

and tells me a lot about what
is going on in the market.
However, I also like to do the
same for the Dow, Nasdaq,
and Russell futures. For the
sake of this example, we
focus mostly on the S&Ps,
but we bring in the other
indexes for part of it as well.
The first thing I want to
look at is today’s close in
relation to the prior three
days’ highs and lows. Did



==================================================
                    PAGE 3423                     
==================================================

today’s price eclipse either of
these levels, or was it
contained within these
levels? If it eclipsed either of
these levels, then we have a
trending market. If it stayed
contained within these levels,
then we have a trading range.
It is very important that you
always understand what type
of market environment
you’re currently in, and this
is one of the easiest and most
accurate ways to tell. If today



==================================================
                    PAGE 3424                     
==================================================

is Thursday and the close is
1050.50, then you just look
at a daily chart and review
the highs and lows for
Wednesday, Tuesday, and
Monday. Did Thursday’s
close make it past these
levels, or was it contained
within these levels?



==================================================
                    PAGE 3425                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 3426                     
==================================================

Figure 23.10
I also like to note where
the close was in relation to
the day’s range. Did the
market close at the top of its
range? If so, there is a good
chance for upward
continuation tomorrow. Did
it close near the bottom of its
range? Or did it close in the
middle—indicating massive
indecision.
Next, I want to see where



==================================================
                    PAGE 3427                     
==================================================

the highs and lows for the
prior day, prior week, and
prior month are located.
These are all important
support and resistance levels,
and I want to know where
they are sitting in relation to
current market prices. I like
to note whether we are
trading above any of these
levels, which is bullish, or
below any of these levels,
which is bearish. If we are
stuck in the middle, then I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3428                     
==================================================

call that neutral.
After this, I look at the
HOLP and LOHP levels (as
discussed in Chapter 19).
Any moves above or below
these key levels are a major
opportunity. I also like to
note whether we are trading
above or below these key
levels, because that is also
bullish or bearish.
The next number I want to
know is the number of days



==================================================
                    PAGE 3429                     
==================================================

in the current trend. The
reason for this is that many
trends reverse after three
days, so if we are in the third
day of a trend, I want to be
aware of it. Also, after six to
seven consecutive days,
markets just lose their gas
and fail to move any further.
I want to know about this so
that I’m not the last one
jumping on the bandwagon.
Finally, I want to know



==================================================
                    PAGE 3430                     
==================================================

where all the open gaps are
sitting. Remember in Chapter
7 when we talked about open
gaps filling within 5 to 10
trading days? It’s important
to know where those gaps are
located.
Pivot Numbers, of Course
We talked extensively about
pivots in Chapter 8, so I’m
not going to explain again
why I look at them.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3431                     
==================================================

However, I do like to have
them handy so that I can look
at them before the trading
day. By placing them in this
easy-to-use Excel
spreadsheet (see Figure
23.11), I can quickly glance
at these levels and see if any
of them line up with the key
price levels we just talked
about. Is the daily pivot also
lined up with an open gap?
That is important because
that level will be particularly



==================================================
                    PAGE 3432                     
==================================================

strong on that trading day.
In addition to the daily
pivots, I’m looking for
confluence with my list of
key numbers among the
weekly and monthly pivots
(see Figure 23.12).

Key Sentiment Readings
We talk about the put/call
ratios in Chapter 6. I like to
record where the put/call
ratio closes on the day, and
also note where the 10-day
moving average of the
put/call ratio is trading.
While the daily number is
good for gauging market
direction on that particular

trading day, the 10-day
moving average pinpoints
major market turns. The
following chart (Figure
23.13) from Decision Point
shows the key turning points
in the markets based on the
reading of the 10-day moving
average on the put/call ratio.
You can get these data from
TradeStation, but I just
subscribe to
www.decisionpoint.com and
get it there. It’s $20 a month,

Figure 23.13
Figure 23.14 shows that
whenever the put/call ratio
gets near 1.00, this excessive
bearishness in the form of
put buying creates a bottom
in the market. All these
shorts then spend the next
several weeks frantically
covering their positions. The
opposite is also true. When
the crowd gets frothy and
overly bullish, driving the PC

overloaded with bulls and
either halts its advance or
rolls over.

Figure 23.14
I also like to look at AAII
investor sentiment, because
this is a good gauge of how
traders are feeling about the
current market. This is also a
contrarian indicator. When
there are too many bears,
look for the markets to
bottom out and reverse.
When there are too many
bulls, look for markets to
take a breather or roll over.

Figure 23.15
Figure 23.15 is a chart
from April 5, 2005, the day
I’m writing this. You can see
that we are at excessive
bearish levels. This tells me
that the market is looking to
bottom out and is starting to
beat up on all the shorts.
The other item I have
listed in Figure 23.13 is the
daily Arms Index reading,
which is shown in Figure



==================================================
                    PAGE 3446                     
==================================================

23.15. This is the indicator
we discuss in Chapter 6, and
I’m looking for readings of
over 2.0 or under 0.50 as key
action signals.
It’s a Good Idea to Know
What These People Are
Doing
The last key number in this
series is the NYSE member
net buy/sell numbers, which I
get from



==================================================
                    PAGE 3447                     
==================================================

www.decisionpoint.com.
This shows whether NYSE
members are net long or
short. If they are net long, it
is because they have very
strong reasons to believe that
they will be able to distribute
their holdings to the public at
a higher price. If they are net
short, they have strong
reasons to believe that they
will be able to buy back their
inventory at a cheaper price.
These people make a lot of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3448                     
==================================================

money, and I like to follow
what they are doing.
Figure 23.16 shows a
couple of huge readings that
came into play over the past
few years. The first was
during the March 2003
bottom. These people loaded
the boat with a record
amount of longs. Lo and
behold, the markets moved
significantly higher shortly
thereafter. They sold their



==================================================
                    PAGE 3449                     
==================================================

inventory all the way up and
then reloaded the boat in
October 2003, just before the
next leg higher. Finally, in
September 2004, they loaded
the boat again with a record
number of long positions.
The markets chopped around
for six weeks and then
rocketed into 2005. If these
people are loading the boat
one way or the other, I want
to know about it.

Miscellaneous Items
The final things I want to
know about are any key
economic and earnings
reports that are coming out
on the day. I’m not
concerned with every
company that is reporting,
but I want to know if a big
company like MSFT or IBM
is going to be coming out



==================================================
                    PAGE 3452                     
==================================================

with numbers after the close.
I also want to know when
key economic reports are
going to be hitting the tape.
There are two main reasons
for this. First, if traders are
waiting for a key earnings
number or an economic
report, they will generally
stand aside to see how the
market reacts. This means
that the markets are going to
be choppy, and I don’t want
to be trying to catch trends



==================================================
                    PAGE 3453                     
==================================================

intraday if the markets are
going to be choppy. On these
days, I will focus on fading
pivot levels and fading
extreme tick readings—these
are the best plays I’ve found
for days where the trading is
light and choppy. The second
thing I’m looking for isn’t
the actual number itself, but
how the markets react to it.
The number, whether it is
earnings or economic, has no
importance. What is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3454                     
==================================================

important is whether the
market sells off on the news,
rallies on the news, or
ignores the news.
The market is efficient at
pricing in information before
it ever comes out. In
addition, large firms have
access to the same research
as the government, and they
hire an army of economists
to figure out what the
numbers are going to be



==================================================
                    PAGE 3455                     
==================================================

before they are announced.
These reports mean little in
the grand scheme of things
because they get priced into
the market well before the
actual number is released.
The moral of the story?
Find a couple of setups and
stick to them, and don’t get
sucked into the “waiting for
the next report” game. Just
because a report is hyped on
CNBC doesn’t mean that it’s



==================================================
                    PAGE 3456                     
==================================================

a good idea to place a lot of
importance on it.
What Does Your Mother
Think?
My final piece of research
has to do with random
comments that I hear from
people who are not in the
industry. A classic example
is a recent conversation I had
with my mother, who
mentioned that she had read



==================================================
                    PAGE 3457                     
==================================================

about eBay in Business
Week. Was it a good time to
buy? In situations like this, I
normally just run out and
look for a short setup on the
stock, but, because it was my
mother, I told her I would
hold off on buying it for
now. Then I shorted it. A few
weeks later, it got killed on
earnings.
Anything that is just now
hitting the ears of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3458                     
==================================================

nontrading public is a major
signal. This typically means
that the people who are
usually the last to know are
thinking about finally getting
in. I can’t think of a better
topping signal in my arsenal
of trading tools.
As I’m writing this, there
is this same flurry of activity
going on in real estate. More
and more random people are
talking about things like



==================================================
                    PAGE 3459                     
==================================================

buying parcels of land sight
unseen from out of the back
of magazines because “real
estate is doing so well.” It’s
almost at the same ferocity as
when Beanie Babies topped
out and crashed back to
earth. Pretty soon we are
going to start seeing major
magazine covers talking
about how everyone is
making money in real estate.
Shortly thereafter, prices will
start to soften. And no, it’s



==================================================
                    PAGE 3460                     
==================================================

not different this time.
Summing Up the Premarket
Checklist
I’ve got a quote on my wall
that says, “Fortune favors the
prepared mind.” There is a
big difference between
getting lucky on one trade
and being able to make
money in the markets
consistently. There is also a
delicate balance between



==================================================
                    PAGE 3461                     
==================================================

being prepared and
overanalyzing, but the basic
set of tools and numbers
discussed in this chapter will
give traders a huge leg up
without drowning them in
barrels of information.
All these data are
available to every trader. It’s
a good practice to take the
time to go through and line
up this information each day.
If you don’t have the time, or



==================================================
                    PAGE 3462                     
==================================================

if you would like
supplemental information,
this is the same routine I go
through each evening. I post
the same daily checklist I’ve
reviewed in this chapter in a
newsletter that comes out
five evenings per week (each
night the stock market is
open). In addition to this
information, I also post the
swing trades I’m setting up
the next trading day, with the
exact entry, exit, target, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3463                     
==================================================

stop loss levels. I typically
focus on stock options,
futures, and currencies, as
well as some individual
stocks.
In addition to these key
levels, I also include a
nightly video that’s
embedded in the newsletter
and records my computer
screen. With this technology,
I’m able to flip through my
charts and make comments,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3464                     
==================================================

discussing the way the
various markets are setting
up and talking about what I
think is going to happen
during the next trading day—
and the orders that I am
placing. This technology is
great, as it allows a person to
look over my shoulder as I’m
doing my research each
night. I don’t rehearse—it’s
all recorded live, so you get
my first impressions, along
with the coughs and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3465

telephone interruptions. A
trader can just click on the
video link, turn up the
speakers on her computer,
and watch and listen.

A two-foot-long arrowana is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3471                     
==================================================

a voracious predator fish. A
single-minded creature, it has
one basic rule of thumb that
it follows each and every
day: if it thinks something
will fit into its mouth, it will
eat it. When traders visit my
office to watch me trade,
they are often surprised to
learn that their first
assignment is to feed Martha,
my two-foot-long pet
arrowana. They have to take
the net, dip it into the feeder



==================================================
                    PAGE 3472                     
==================================================

tank filled with goldfish, and
choose a victim. Martha is
used to this routine by now,
and she begins to shimmer
with excitement and
anticipation. The goldfish is
released. The water boils and
churns as the predator
lunges, and a few seconds
later, all that remains of
Nemo is a few scales and a
bit of fin. Steve Patrow, a
visiting trader, summed it up
succinctly when he said,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3473                     
==================================================

“That just seems really
cruel.”
“Yep,” I replied. “Almost
as cruel as sending a trader
out into the markets without
a fully developed trading
plan.” A trader who is trying
to make a living in the
markets without a fully
developed trading plan is in
exactly the same position as
the goldfish. Whereas one is
merely a meal for an



==================================================
                    PAGE 3474                     
==================================================

arrowana, the other is
routinely preyed upon by
professional traders. At least
for the goldfish, the pain is
over quickly. Traders without
a plan can stretch out their
torment for years.
My first trading plan was
created in 1993, eight years
after I started trading. It was
a one-page document that has
evolved over the years into
the 15-page plan that I use



==================================================
                    PAGE 3475                     
==================================================

today. This plan evolved out
of experience and from
having other traders share
their plans with me. I update
this plan annually. My plan
expanded over the years as I
realized the following truths:
• A superior per-trade
tracking system had to
be set in place.
• A specific day-to-day
money management
system had to be set in



==================================================
                    PAGE 3476                     
==================================================

place.
• A methodology for
holding specific trading
setups accountable for
performance had to be
set in place.
• A reward and
punishment system for
myself had to be set in
place.
• My plan had to evolve
and take into account



==================================================
                    PAGE 3477                     
==================================================

the setups and markets
that best fit my
personality.
• Not only did I have to
incorporate trading into
my plan, but I had to
incorporate it into my
whole life to really
make the plan work.
One reality of trading is
that this is a profession
that can take over a
person and dominate



==================================================
                    PAGE 3478                     
==================================================

his life. It is important
that you recognize this
and bring a more
holistic approach to
your overall trading
plan. This keeps a
trader in the game for
the longer term, helping
to prevent burnout—a
common occurrence in
the trading world.
Every trader I’ve worked
with has mentioned that the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3479                     
==================================================

comprehensive business plan
that I make him write has
been the deciding factor in
his own performance. “It was
when I turned the corner,” is
a common phrase I’ve heard
used to describe the results of
writing out such a detailed
plan. What’s in the plan? I’ll
show you the questions I
make myself answer every
year and take you through
them step by step. After I’m
done with this, I’ll share a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3480                     
==================================================

plan that was developed by
one of the traders I’ve
worked with. What follows
are the questions and
excerpts from the answers in
my actual trading plan for
2005.
Why Am I Trading Again
This Year?
The first question I ask
myself each year is, why am
I trading again this year?



==================================================
                    PAGE 3481                     
==================================================

Although this might seem
obvious, it is important to
deliberately choose this
occupation over everything
else that’s available out
there. This applies whether
you are trading part time
while you’re holding down
another job or are trading full
time. Here is my answer:
The main reason I’m
going to continue trading in
2012 is that I enjoy the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3482                     
==================================================

financial independence and
freedom that trading has to
offer. I also love the fact that
I can do this from anywhere,
because I don’t like to be tied
down to any one location.
I’ve never been good at
taking orders, so I appreciate
that I don’t have a boss
whom I have to placate. I
enjoy meeting other traders
because they are the most
random, eclectic, crazy, and
interesting people on the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3483                     
==================================================

planet. I enjoy the mental
challenge and stimulation
that come from trading, and I
know that if I stopped, I
would miss it. As long as
I’ve been doing this, I’ve yet
to encounter two trading days
that have been the same. Just
as I get comfortable, the
market reminds me who is
running the show. There
truly is never a dull moment.

==================================================
                    PAGE 3484                     
==================================================

This is where I take stock of
everything else that is going
on in my life and how it
might affect my trading. By
doing this, I figured out when
I needed to hire my first
assistant, when I needed to
bring in another partner, and
whatever else needed to be
done in order to streamline
my life for trading. Here’s
what I wrote down for 2005:
I have a lot of activities



==================================================
                    PAGE 3485                     
==================================================

going on in my life besides
trading. I’m actively
involved in real estate
investing, coin collecting,
and traveling, and I have a
lot of stuff going on with my
website and other financial
market–related programs. I
also have a lovely wife who
expects me to notice that she
is a living and breathing
human being, and I’ve
realized how important it is
to include her in my plans



==================================================
                    PAGE 3486                     
==================================================

and keep her involved in the
process, as well as being able
to “leave trading at the door”
and spend quality time with
her. It’s good for her, it’s
good for me, and it’s good
for us. Happy wife, happy
life.
My wife and I are
expecting our first child, and
we are considering moving
from Boston to Austin,
Texas, where most of our

                    PAGE 3487                     
==================================================

family is located. I know that
trading is my main
occupation, and that the only
way I can continue with
these other things is if I’m
making profits from my
trading. It is possible that I
will drop some of these other
activities if they become a
distraction. I will
compartmentalize and focus
on trading during trading
hours. To help with this, I
have someone who runs the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3488                     
==================================================

day-to-day operations of the
website, I have a cook and a
maid to handle all routine
daily chores around the
house and the office, and I
have someone else who helps
manage my other
investments. I will focus on
writing newsletters that
pertain only to my own
trading, instead of writing
about what I think other
people want to know about.
These newsletters are mostly



==================================================
                    PAGE 3489                     
==================================================

for me to help force myself
to clarify my own research
and continue to find new
trading ideas. I will not try to
please all the people all the
time.
I won’t try to day-trade if
I am traveling or on vacation.
It’s okay to have swing
trades on and manage
existing positions, as long as
I have a stop and a target in
place and I don’t try to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3490                     
==================================================

“outthink” the position
intraday. If I have
distractions going on, I will
not trade. I will get rid of the
distractions first. Examples
include having uninvited
guests over, morning phone
calls, people instant
messaging me in the morning
asking about a trade, and so
forth. I will take care of the
distractions. I will ignore
phone calls and instant
messages until after 11:00

==================================================

a.m. eastern or, better yet,
turn them off. I will not be
accommodating just to be
nice. The path to hell is
paved with good intentions.
Fast-forward to 2012, and
things are busier, with three
kids in the mix and a
growing website business
and trading operation. This
year has been particularly
busy, and I’m consciously
trying to get things in place



==================================================
                    PAGE 3492                     
==================================================

to “simplify.” This means
getting key people in place to
help out, and focusing on
what is important. The truth
is, I could always check out
and just trade, but the
business aspect is also
interesting. The key is setting
things up so that I don’t have
to work a 16-hour day to get
everything done. This means
asking for help, and
recharging. And saying no,
which isn’t easy. For me,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3493                     
==================================================

I’ve found that being able to
get away on the weekends
has been invaluable in terms
of being able to spend quality
time with my family and
rejuvenate. We have a place
in the country where we can
head out on Friday, hang out
with our goats and llama (in
no particular order), and
unplug for 48 hours. To me,
this was an important enough
goal to find a way to make it
work. As an added bonus, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3494                     
==================================================

place is crawling with
scorpions, which makes
walking through the house
barefoot an adventure.
What Markets Am I Going
to Trade?
This is where I lay out all the
markets I’m going to trade.
Beginning traders should be
focusing on only a few
markets. Once a trader
decides on the markets she



==================================================
                    PAGE 3495                     
==================================================

wants to trade, she should
stick with those markets for a
year instead of looking for
the “next great thing.”
For day trades, I’m going
to trade the mini-sized Dow
(YM), the E-mini S&Ps (ES),
the E-mini Russell (TF), 30-
year bonds (US), and the
major currency pairs. For
swing trades, I will trade the
E-mini Nasdaq (NQ), 10-
year notes (TY), corn (C),



==================================================
                    PAGE 3496                     
==================================================

wheat (W), soybeans (S),
crude oil (CL), gold (GC),
silver (SI), single-stock
futures, individual stocks,
and stock options, in addition
to taking swing trades in the
major currency pairs in the
forex markets. I will allocate
my total trading funds as
follows:
• 25 percent intraday
trades (ES, YM, TF,
US, forex markets)



==================================================
                    PAGE 3497                     
==================================================

• 25 percent swing trades
on futures (NQ, TY, C,
W, S, CL, GC, SI,
single-stock futures,
forex markets)
• 25 percent swing trades
on stocks
• 25 percent swing trades
on stock options
Why These Markets? What
Specific Trading Strategies
Am I Going to Use?



==================================================
                    PAGE 3498                     
==================================================

This is a really important part
of the plan. Traders should
have a specific setup for each
market they are trading. This
way, the setup can be tracked
for performance. Each setup
should be independent in
itself. This means that a
trader could have a short on
the YM for a gap play and a
long on the ES for a pivot
play simultaneously, and
then track the performance of
each setup separately.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3499                     
==================================================

For intraday trades, I will
use the following plays:
• YM: gap plays, tick
fades, and pivot plays
• ES: squeeze plays,
waves, and market
internals
• TF: squeeze plays and
pivot plays
• US: break of the
high/low 15-minute bar,
squeeze plays



==================================================
                    PAGE 3500                     
==================================================

• Forex markets: box
plays, squeeze plays,
break of the high/low
15-minute bar
For swing trades, I
will use the following
plays:
• All futures and forex
plays: daily squeeze
plays, box plays, break
of the high/low day,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3501                     
==================================================

8/21-period EMA for
swings (for single-stock
futures)
• All stock plays: daily
squeeze plays, box
plays, break of the
high/low day, 8/21-
period EMA for swings
• All stock options plays:
daily squeeze plays,
break of the high/low
day, 8/21-period EMA
for swings



==================================================
                    PAGE 3502                     
==================================================

The key with this is that if
I don’t have a specific setup
in one of these markets, then
I’m not taking a trade. I just
wait until something sets up.
How Much Money Am I
Going to Allocate to
Each Trading Strategy and
Setup?
Determining how much
money to allocate to each
trading strategy and setup is,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3503                     
==================================================

of course, critical. The key is
to find an allocation that
doesn’t cause any stress,
allows the chance for a trade
to do its work, and won’t
violate any daily drawdown
rules. One of the biggest
problems I see with newer
traders is that they are
trading way too big in
relation to their account size.
Trading 10 lots on a $10,000
account is like introducing
your mistress to your wife.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3504                     
==================================================

Yes, you can do it, but that
doesn’t make it a good idea.
(Luckily, my wife has a great
sense of humor.)
The following allocations
are based on a per $100,000
basis. The number of
contracts or the position size
to be used is as follows:



==================================================
                    PAGE 3505                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 3506                     
==================================================

These numbers will seem
conservative to some of you
and aggressive to others. I’ve
seen traders take a $100,000
account and start trading 60
ES contracts at a time. Pretty
soon they are trading six
contracts, because that’s all
the money they have left to
trade. The goal with this plan
is to make a living, not a
killing.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3507                     
==================================================

What Execution Methods
Will I Be Using? What
Parameters?
This is where I decide my
primary execution method.
Am I scaling in? Am I
scaling out? Am I getting all
in and all out? What is my
risk/reward ratio? This is a
lengthy part of the plan, as I
will write down sample plays
for all my categories. I’m not
going to do that with all my



==================================================
                    PAGE 3508                     
==================================================

plays here, but I will spell
out my parameters for gap
plays.
For all of my intraday
plays, I will get in all at once
and scale out as the position
goes my way. The target on
the first half of my play will
be small, the equivalent of 1
to 2 ES points or 10 to 20
YM points. Once I have this
initial profit, I will give the
second half more room to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3509                     
==================================================

play out. For my swing
plays, I will get in all at once
and get out all at once,
trailing my stop to protect
any gains.
For five-minute squeeze
plays on YM, I will get in all
at once, using 10 contracts
per $100,000. I will use a
mechanical target of 10
points on the first half for
choppy days, and 20 points
on the first half for more



==================================================
                    PAGE 3510                     
==================================================

volatile days, as determined
by the volume on the ES on a
five-minute chart (Chapter
6). If the target on the first
half is hit, I will move my
stop up to breakeven. I will
stay in the trade until one of
four things happens:
• My stop is hit.
• I get a reading of 800
ticks in the opposite
direction from my
trade.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3511                     
==================================================

• There is a reading of
1,000 ticks in the
direction of my trade.
• The squeeze loses
momentum.
I do this for each of my
plays, so that there is no
question as to how they
should be executed. This is
crucial because it ties in
directly with the next portion
of the plan.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3512                     
==================================================

How Am I Going to Track
and Rank My Trades?
This is where I detail how I
am going to track each of the
setups I trade and how they
are working. I track this
information in Excel, which
calculates a running average.
I will track all my trades
and rate them as follows:
5. Target hit
4. Out at a different



==================================================
                    PAGE 3513                     
==================================================

price from target, but
profitable
3. Out at breakeven
2. Out at a different
price from stop, but a
losing trade
1. Stop hit
I will add up my daily
score and divide by the
number of trades to get an
average. This provides a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3514                     
==================================================

“grade point average” on the
different setups and how they
are doing. I separate the
trades based on the specific
setup that is being used. At
the end of the month, I will
have an average for each
setup and an overall
cumulative average. This will
help me to weed out the
setups that aren’t working.
For example, I may have
something at the end of the
month that reads, “Gap



==================================================
                    PAGE 3515                     
==================================================

plays: 4.24; squeeze plays:
3.57; pivot plays: 3.87.” By
looking at this, I can see
trends in these setups and
potentially drop setups that
aren’t working or allocate
more funds to setups that are
working. It is imperative that
traders do two things well in
order to do this. First, they
have to spend 10 minutes a
day keying their trades into
an Excel spreadsheet or into
a journal. Second, they have



==================================================
                    PAGE 3516                     
==================================================

to follow their setups the
same way each and every
time. This brings me to an
important rule regarding my
trading plan:
Any trade I
take that does
not fall into a
specific setup
or chart
pattern that I
have outlined,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3517                     
==================================================

I will label as
an “impulse
play.”
This includes plays in
which I took a specific signal
to get in, but I got out of the
trade too late or too early
because I wasn’t paying
attention or because I was
feeling hopeful or scared or
whatever. This is a weakness,
and if I succumb to this
temptation, I must track it



==================================================
                    PAGE 3518                     
==================================================

and see the impact it has on
my trading. I know from past
experience that the results of
my “impulse plays” over
time are poor, and this
reminder keeps me from
taking these trades. However,
I do not want to get lax, and I
will continue to write down
these trades and track them if
I do take them. I will make
notes on these trades. Did I
jump in too soon? Did I miss
a fill? Did I chase? I have



==================================================
                    PAGE 3519                     
==================================================

found that by tracking these
things, I’m also holding
myself accountable. The
more I keep tracking my
trades, the fewer impulsive
trades I take and the fewer
overall amateur mistakes I
make.
To this end, I also grade
my trades on how well I
followed the setup. I will
give a trade a 5 if I followed
the setup to the letter—



==================================================
                    PAGE 3520                     
==================================================

whether or not it makes
money. Any trade that is not
a 5 is an impulse play. You
have to be brutally honest
with yourself here. If you
aren’t, you’re only hurting
yourself and anyone who
depends on your trading
income.
I will also note any overall
trends in my trading. How
many days did I start off
losing but ended up on the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3521                     
==================================================

plus side? How many days
did I start off strong, only to
give it all back? What was
going on that day in terms of
interruptions, phone calls,
family stuff, and the like? I
know from past experience
that I get in trouble when I
start off strong and start to go
for “bigger trades with house
money.” I will keep track of
any days in which I let greed
get the best of me, then work
on reducing the number of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3522                     
==================================================

those days.
What Are My Drawdown
Rules?
If I am down by 15 percent
for the month, I will cut my
position size in half for the
rest of the month. If I am
down by 20 percent for the
month, I will stop trading for
the rest of the month. If I hit
a 30 percent total drawdown,
it is time for a six-week



==================================================
                    PAGE 3523                     
==================================================

break from trading. My daily
drawdown maximum for
intraday trading is $3,000 per
$100,000. If at the end of the
day I have exceeded this
level, I am on probation the
next day. If I exceed $3,000
per $100,000 again that
week, I am done for the rest
of the week. This is my
punishment for breaking my
trading rules.
I have to point out that



==================================================
                    PAGE 3524                     
==================================================

many hedge funds and
money managers are much
more conservative than this
when it comes to drawdowns
and annual targets. A
monthly drawdown of more
than 5 percent can be
devastating for a hedge
fund’s business, and an
annual gain of 20 percent,
year after year, opens the
floodgates to billions and
billions of dollars for any
fund. I have a couple of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3525                     
==================================================

comments on that.
First off, the day-trading
strategies discussed in this
book are not going to work
for a $400 million fund.
There is nowhere near
enough liquidity to enable a
fund to get into and out of
the markets with that much
money in that short a time
frame. Many funds, however,
will allocate a portion of
their $400 million to take



==================================================
                    PAGE 3526                     
==================================================

advantage of the intraday
trading opportunities I
describe in this book. Out of
$400 million, how much
would they allocate? Maybe
a million. That is ¼ of 1
percent of the entire fund.
I bring this up because
people need to treat their
trading account for what it is
—a high-risk way to make a
living. Most of a trader’s
funds should be kept in



==================================================
                    PAGE 3527                     
==================================================

conservative vehicles—
things like bonds or funds
run by conservative money
managers. Only a portion of
total funds should be
allocated to an aggressive
trading account designed to
generate monthly income.
What Are My Profit Rules?
My target daily average goal
for intraday trading is $500
per day per $100,000. This is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3528                     
==================================================

conservative and achievable,
and it adds up quickly. I will
focus on generating five
$2,000 per $100,000 days per
month. This means that I
don’t have to trade every
day. I know from past
experience that my best
trading days are Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday.
Therefore, I will focus more
on trading on these days. If I
am up more than $2,000 per
$100,000 before noon, I will



==================================================
                    PAGE 3529                     
==================================================

continue to trade until I have
a losing trade, at which point
I will stop for the day. If I
have a day in which I make
$5,000 per $100,000, I will
take the next day off to
escape those feelings of
euphoria that cause traders to
do stupid things like double
up on positions or trade
without a stop. I will stop
trading for the rest of the
month at $20,000 per
$100,000. I will track my



==================================================
                    PAGE 3530                     
==================================================

daily equity curve through
using an Excel spreadsheet.
I will withdraw 50 percent
of my trading profits at the
end of each quarter. I will
never add money to an
account that is down, and I
will never meet a margin
call. I will add money to an
account that has proved itself
with positive returns. The
reason I will withdraw profits
is because this is the best



==================================================
                    PAGE 3531                     
==================================================

way to protect them. It is
with these profits that I get to
invest in more real estate,
buy more gold coins, pay for
a family vacation, and fund
my projects. It also is a
reminder that the numbers on
the screen are real and
represent real cash.
What Is My Office Setup
Going to Be Like?
I have a separate apartment a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3532                     
==================================================

few miles from my house
that I have set up specifically
for trading. My computer
setup is in the living room.
One of the bedrooms has a
computer in it, and I can go
in there and shut the door if I
need privacy (as when I’m
trying to write a book). The
privacy is not only from
people, but from the markets.
It’s good to take a break. The
other bedroom is set up for
an office for my assistant.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3533                     
==================================================

The apartment next door
houses the TTM team, and
we recently added another
apartment because we
needed the space. I’m sure
the apartment complex
manager is wondering why I
need three apartments. We
may need to get “real office
space” soon. I have AT&T
U-Verse (fiber), which is an
awesome broadband
connection, and I have cable
broadband as a backup. My



==================================================
                    PAGE 3534                     
==================================================

goal this year is to get two
people to help me with my
actual trading as I continue to
expand the markets I watch,
and to program more of my
trading setups to generate
mechanical signals. I have
had my trading office located
in “regular” office space, but
I found the solicitors and the
general banter too distracting
for trading. Also, when other
people in the office building
found out that I had quote



==================================================
                    PAGE 3535                     
==================================================

screens all over the place,
they started stopping by to
check out what the markets
were doing. This was fine the
first few times, but then it got
real annoying, real quick. In
contrast, in the apartment,
I’ve got a full kitchen, and
it’s still okay to work in a
robe. And best of all, there

My Trading Is Going Well?
This is where I establish
goals that motivate me to
stick to my plan. I know that
if I stick to my plan, my
trading has a better chance of
succeeding. And if I succeed,
I get to reward myself.
If I hit 60 percent for the
year, I will take the next four
weeks off. If this occurs in
the fourth quarter, I will take
the rest of the year off. I

could go for more money,
but it’s enough. For 2005, I
want to spend two weeks in
northern Italy and
Switzerland. I want to take
four long weekends where I
go to a beach and do nothing.
I want to visit Australia,
Hong Kong, Taipei, and
Tokyo this year, whether on
business or for pleasure. I
like to watch movies, and I
would like to upgrade my
home theater system. I have a

                    PAGE 3538                     
==================================================

farm in southwest Nebraska,
and I would like to buy
another section of farmland
in that area. I realize that I
need to focus on the setups
and not focus on the money
needed for the rewards. If I
focus on the money, I will
lose. If I focus on the setups,
I will win.
Updating this in 2011, I
did visit all of those areas
and bought some more

                    PAGE 3539

farmland. Going forward,
I’m not interested as much in
“buying stuff” as I am in
“saving time.”
Are There Any Groups,
People, or Organizations
I’d Like to Help Out This
Year?
I used to send money to the
Salvation Army, but I don’t
really feel any impact when I
donate money to big

out individuals. I also do a
lot of work with
www.DreamsForKids.org,
which is doing amazing work
with children. There is a
school in Austin that I would
like to help out so they can
expand.

I have gained from my own
experiences to help me stay
profitable in my trading.
After you have a $5,000

feelings of euphoria by
taking the next day off and
doing something that
humbles you, like playing
golf or flying a plane or
sparring with a black belt in

S&Ps between 12:00 noon
and 2:00 p.m. unless you are
managing an existing
position (do not initiate any
new trades). Between 8:30
a.m. eastern and 10:30 a.m.
eastern, leave your instant
messaging service off, do not
check e-mail, and do not
answer phones. In the trading
room, let people know that
you will not answer
questions during this time.
Minimize the trading room

read what is going on in the
room. You can talk about
what you are looking at and
what you are doing over the
microphone. If people have
questions, they will have to
wait. If they don’t like that,
they can leave. Do not trade
anything during the
overnight S&P session.
Better yet, don’t watch it,
either. If you quit early
because you had a 20 percent

so that you cannot trade. Go
to Cape Cod if it is summer
or go skiing if it is winter. Do
not trade after 12 noon on
Fridays. Focus on trading
lighter or not trading at all
during the last three days of
options expiration. Review
your performance during this
time and consider this as
your time off during the
month. For the past year, the
market has seemed to do



==================================================
                    PAGE 3545                     
==================================================

absolutely nothing during
this time. Focus heavily on
the first two trading weeks of
the month. After the first two
trading weeks are over, take
the next two trading days off
and get away from the
markets. Give your brain a
rest. Take off the entire week
of Thanksgiving. Take off
the last two weeks of the
year. Plan your vacations in
August so that you won’t be
missing anything.

What Am I Doing About
My Physical Health?
This portion of the book
deserves a thorough update,
not because I need to change
any of the information, but
because I want to expand it.
The comments and reactions
to this portion of the book
have been remarkable. It’s a
topic that people don’t think
about until it’s thrown in
their face. Since I wrote this,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3547                     
==================================================

I’ve found a few additional
useful pieces of information
that I’ve incorporated into
my life. I’ve had some issues
I’ve had to deal with
regarding health, and that led
me onto a path of being a
guinea pig and talking to all
kinds of doctors and trying
all kinds of different things
in order to be as highly
functioning as possible. As
one of my doctor-clients
recently told me, “Look, you



==================================================
                    PAGE 3548                     
==================================================

can be average or you can be
great. The difference is 300
minutes per week.” That 300
minutes refers to vigorous
cardio activity. It’s the
difference between a body
that is functioning at
optimum levels versus one
that is just getting by. That is
direct from a 68-year-old
surgeon who practices what
he preaches (he walks for an
hour a day on a treadmill at
an incline, 5 days per week).



==================================================
                    PAGE 3549                     
==================================================

He sees the results day in and
day out of his many patients
who don’t follow that advice.
For him, it’s both sad and
motivating. Something so
simple to do, yet so hard to
maintain. Let’s take a look.
Your ability to trade
effectively and consistently
is directly related to your
physical well-being. You
sharpen your mind through
physical activity and plenty



==================================================
                    PAGE 3550                     
==================================================

of exercise, as well as
healthy eating. I’m going to
share with you my recent
health experiences. I debated
whether to include this or
not, as this is a book on
trading, not on health kicks.
And, of course, I’m certainly
not a doctor. However, I do
feel strongly that optimum
health is important for a
trader, so I’ll talk about my
recent experiences and you
can take the information for



==================================================
                    PAGE 3551                     
==================================================

what it’s worth.
I’ve always been health-
conscious, though I certainly
go through “less healthy”
periods of time. I try to work
out regularly, watch what
I’m eating, not drink too
much alcohol or caffeine,
and take vitamins. When I
was 34, I took a couple of
physical fitness tests and
detailed exams, and was
surprised by the results. First



==================================================
                    PAGE 3552                     
==================================================

off, my cardiovascular health
and flexibility were rated as
excellent. This means that
my running and aerobic
activity over the years were
keeping me in good shape.
That was where the good
news ended. I then
discovered that my body fat
percent was much higher
than I thought, and I would
need to lose 20 pounds of fat.
This was a total surprise.
Second, I discovered that I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3553                     
==================================================

had an extremely low pH
level, which means that my
body was highly acidic. I
then went on to find out the
many pleasant things that are
associated with having a
continuous low pH/high
acidic reading in the human
body. Some of you will know
what this means, while others
of you won’t. I’m going to
condense this as much as
possible and share it, so that
people who are interested can



==================================================
                    PAGE 3554                     
==================================================

research this for themselves,
form their own opinions, and
make their own decisions
regarding their health. I
swear on my unborn child
that this is not going to lead
into a multilevel marketing
pitch.
In a nutshell, a low pH
level (high acidity) is the root
cause of more than 50
percent of all diseases
leading to hospitalization,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3555                     
==================================================

including all the killers like
heart disease and cancer, and
of psychological diseases as
well. More specifically, it
causes plaque to form on
artery walls, and it causes
imbalances in the brain that
lead to insomnia, anxiety,
and impairment of memory.
It also leads to calcium
deficiencies, as calcium is
pulled from the bones to
fight the high acidic levels in
the body, and these lead to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3556                     
==================================================

weakened or collapsed
vertebrae, poor posture, and
back pain. A high acidic
reading in the body leads to
dysfunction of the digestive
system causing indigestion,
gaseousness, bloating, and
abdominal cramping.
Because of this, not enough
nutrients get absorbed from
the food we eat, and the
entire body can experience
malnutrition. This also
causes undigested foods to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3557                     
==================================================

ferment in the intestines,
causing toxicity. High acidity
also interferes with the basic
functions of the colon,
causing constipation and
many other unpleasant side
effects. The list goes on and
on, with the immune system,
the respiratory system, the
urinary system, and the
glandular system all being
affected by a low pH level
(high acidity) in the body.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3558                     
==================================================

I had no idea about any of
this until I was told about it,
and I was admittedly
obstinate with the doctor
when he was telling me
about this. Did I have
cancer? No. Were my bones
weak? No. He assured me
that in time this would
become a problem, but he did
pinpoint an immediate
problem, and that was with
my digestive system. He
asked me if I had to take



==================================================
                    PAGE 3559                     
==================================================

antacids frequently because
of heartburn. “Yep,” I
answered. He also asked,
rather delicately, I might add,
if, upon emerging from the
bathroom after “doing my
business,” I noticed a strong,
almost embarrassing odor.
This applied equally to any
gas I might be passing into
the atmosphere. “Uh, yeah,
that happens sometimes,” I
said. He smiled and told me
that this was due to the high



==================================================
                    PAGE 3560                     
==================================================

acidity in my system, which
caused the digestive system
to falter and not fully digest
the food I was eating—which
also was the cause of my
extra 20 pounds of fat.
Before I embarrass myself
further, let’s jump into the
next obvious question. What
causes high acidity? Not
surprisingly, it’s the foods
we eat—mostly the ones that
are manufactured and come



==================================================
                    PAGE 3561                     
==================================================

in cans or boxes. Even more
so, it is based on what we
drink. Sodas, regular or diet,
are the worst culprit. I used
to suck down three or four
Diet Cokes a day. I love
sodas. Unfortunately, the
more doctors I’ve talked to,
the more convincing the
argument has been that sodas
are killers, just like
cigarettes. Believe me, that is
something I never thought
would be coming out of my



==================================================
                    PAGE 3562                     
==================================================

mouth. I stopped cold turkey
and haven’t had one since.
With respect to diet, I
found it amusing that many
of the things I thought were
healthy were responsible for
my current condition. In the
mornings, I would pour soy
milk on my cereal. Well,
while soy is good for you,
processed soy is like drinking
soda, and most cereals are
highly acidic because of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3563                     
==================================================

high proportion of refined
flour in them. For lunch, I
would have a sliced turkey
sandwich, soup, and a diet
soda. Well, the turkey is bad
because packaged lunch
meats carry nitrates that ruin
a person’s stomach. The
bread was bad because of the
refined flour, and of course
the soda was bad. For dinner
I would have something
similar to what I had for
lunch.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3564                     
==================================================

To top it off, I also found
out that all of the vitamins I
took were worthless because
they were synthetic. This
applies to every vitamin a
person takes that lists
ascorbic acid for vitamin C,
which is pretty much every
vitamin. What about all the
health benefits that you read
about and hear in the media?
It’s called marketing.
Anyway, here is the list of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3565                     
==================================================

foods by category, regarding
overall health for the body.
Foods that promote a healthy
pH level are listed first, and
the “killers” are listed at the
bottom.
1. Eat all you want
• Raw fruits
• Raw vegetables (or
lightly steamed)



==================================================
                    PAGE 3566

soy lecithin)
• White bread
Things like fast food
aren’t just “fattening,” they
wreak havoc on your system.
They’re toxic, in fact. How
does one mass-produce a
food product like meat that
can be served fast in under a
minute? Very disgustingly. If



==================================================
                    PAGE 3572                     
==================================================

you aren’t convinced, watch
the documentary Food, Inc. I
haven’t set foot in a fast-food
place since, and I won’t let
my kids eat that crap either.
There is a great saying I
heard from a doctor that went
something like, “If you won’t
feed it to your dog, then
don’t feed it to your kid.”
Calm children are the result
of healthy foods. Of course,
this applies to us adults as
well.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3573                     
==================================================

Admittedly, eating the
foods from the first group on
a regular basis took some
getting used to—that is, until
I discovered a Vitamix
blender. One of the best
pieces of advice I received
from a nutritionist was to
have a “green shake” every
day. Take one cup of fresh
fruit, one cup of water, and
one large handful of green
leaves (spinach, kale, lettuce,
or something similar), throw



==================================================
                    PAGE 3574                     
==================================================

it in the blender, then drink
it. Okay, it doesn’t taste very
good at first, but I got used to
it, and I eventually added
other things like goji berries
and cacao nibs. This drink is
amazingly simple and
amazingly healthy. It keeps
the brain alert, flushes toxins
from your body, and keeps
your pH levels high. And
best of all, I don’t have to
endlessly chew salads.
Instead of using a juicer,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3575                     
==================================================

which makes a mess of all
the pulp, I’ll just take my
Vitamix, throw in a whole
apple, a carrot, some frozen
peas, a large handful of
spinach, pour in some fresh,
clean water, and just mix it
together. Again, we aren’t
going for a best-tasting-drink
contest here. We are going
for awesome health. And to
top it off, this drink is very
high in fiber. As you will
notice soon after you start



==================================================
                    PAGE 3576                     
==================================================

drinking it. Why is fiber
important? Fiber absorbs
waste and pushes it out of
your body. If you aren’t
getting enough fiber to push
the waste out through your
colon, then the waste will try
to get out of your body in
other ways. Through sweat.
Mucus. Zits. All very
pleasant. Eating a large
bunch of green leaves every
day is about the best thing
you can do for yourself.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3577                     
==================================================

I love cereal, but now in
the mornings I eat oatmeal
with fruit, and later in the
day I’ll have a green shake,
sometimes with whey or
even pea-based protein
powder. I love deli
sandwiches and sodas, but
now for lunch I eat a Greek
salad with grilled chicken
and water. For dinner I’ll
have vegetables, salad, and
either chicken or fish. For
snacks throughout the day,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3578                     
==================================================

instead of grabbing
something from the vending
machine, I’ll have an apple
with almond butter or a
handful of raw almonds that
have been soaking in water.
And, believe it or not,
cooking eggs (local if you
can get them) in real butter is
a lot better for you than
cooking them in oil. Most
oils turn rancid when they
are heated. Avoiding rancid
oils is one of the keys to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3579                     
==================================================

health. These oils are also
found in many favorite
foods, such as chips,
crackers, and so on.
Essentially, anything that
needs to be preserved on a
shelf in a box needs to be
doused in oils, which then
turn rancid. What about
stink? Don’t worry, the
rancid smell is covered up
with perfumes. Nice. If you
want a cookie, then make
them at home.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3580                     
==================================================

My challenges today
aren’t food-based, and this
stems more from my travel
schedule. I still drink alcohol,
but only on Fridays and
Saturdays, and then only two
drinks (except when I’m
working on a book—sorry,
liver!). Every once in a
while, I will do a cleanse and
not drink any alcohol for 60
days. I can say without a
doubt that I always feel much
better when I’m off the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3581                     
==================================================

weekend juice.
The biggest challenge for
me is caffeine, and I go
through periods where I cut
back on it slowly and then
wean myself off it, reducing
my consumption over the
course of a couple of weeks.
When I do this and adjust, I
always notice that I have
more energy because I start
drinking so much water. The
biggest change during the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3582                     
==================================================

trading day is that instead of
sucking on sodas and coffee
and having my energy move
up and down like a stochastic
on a five-minute chart, I
drink six bottles of water
(16.9 ounces each) a day, and
my energy level stays high
and constant. The transition
was difficult, but after four
weeks of doing it, I couldn’t
imagine going back to my
old habits—that is, until I got
on a plane for a two-week



==================================================
                    PAGE 3583                     
==================================================

trip to Asia with the CME
Group. The jet lag knocked
me over and I needed a
caffeine IV before a talk, and
it was all over.
I found that caffeine
helped prevent “brain fog”
during the day and also
helped me out when I felt
general fatigue. I asked my
doctor about this, and he did
some blood tests. He
discovered that my adrenals



==================================================
                    PAGE 3584                     
==================================================

were shot and my thyroid
function was on the low side.
This is a common thing
among people who just feel
“fatigued” throughout the
day. For my particular blood
test results, he said that I
needed an adrenal rebuilder
to help repair the adrenal
glands. Adding some bile
salts and milk thistle for a
healthy liver got me on the
road to feeling better and
more alert. Your adrenals get



==================================================
                    PAGE 3585                     
==================================================

worn out when you eat sugar,
refined carbohydrates,
caffeine, and alcohol, all of
which put stress on these
glands. Sound familiar?
These are also acidic foods.
It’s a big circle. When you
eat and drink healthy, it
really makes an impact.
Although I don’t eat sugar or
refined carbs, those
beverages snuck back in and
didn’t help. It was time to go
back to the heavy water diet.

As I’m writing this, I’ve been
off caffeine for about 2
months. I find that if I start
eating processed foods like
bread, I get tired and crave
caffeine. But when I eat
foods that are healthy and
alive, then I have more
energy than I know what to
do with.
I’m including this
information because it was a
real eye-opener for me, and a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3587                     
==================================================

big key to my improved
health. One side benefit to all
this, besides feeling better
and sleeping better, was that
I lost the extra 20 pounds I
was carrying in five months,
without increasing the
amount of exercising I was
doing. It was just a matter of
eating foods that helped the
functions in my body instead
of harming them.
One thing our doctor did



==================================================
                    PAGE 3588                     
==================================================

to jump-start my wife and me
was put us on a 21-day
cleanse. There are many of
these available. The one we
did was called the “Standard
Process Purification Product
Kit,” which is available on
Amazon. It flushes out
toxins, cleans out the liver,
and, over the course of eating
extremely healthy foods for
21 days, erases cravings for
the crap food. The first few
days are tough (I nearly

==================================================

licked smeared egg off my
kid’s face), but the body
adapts quickly. My wife
dropped 15 pounds and her
skin started glowing.
Finally, as a trader, I
spend an inordinate amount
of time in front of computers,
and this isn’t the best thing
for posture. I never though
much about it until I started
tweaking my lower back on a
regular basis at the gym. One



==================================================
                    PAGE 3590                     
==================================================

of my older and wiser friends
told me to “go see my
chiropractor.” I said, “What?
I don’t see chiropractors.
They’re whack jobs.” He just
shook his head in disgust. To
make a long story short, I
started doing regular
adjustments at a chiropractor
who uses the “Gonstead
system,” and my lower back
tweaks disappeared quickly.
After that I kept going (and
keep going) in for regular



==================================================
                    PAGE 3591                     
==================================================

adjustments and tune-ups.
My mom sat in front of a
desk for years at her job, and
she never saw a chiropractor.
I had her visit mine and he
took an x-ray, but at this
point her spine has fused
together and there is nothing
he can do, and she has to live
with the pain. Mine was
approaching being fused, but
it has now been adjusted so
that it’s closer to “normal.” I
feel a lot better, and since I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3592                     
==================================================

started the adjustments more
than two years ago, I haven’t
been sick. Somehow it is also
supposed to be good for your
immune system.
There is one last thing I
recently had done, and again
this came about as a result of
consulting with a nutritionist.
I had my three amalgamated
fillings that I’ve had in my
mouth for 20 years removed.
The main component of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3593                     
==================================================

dental amalgam is mercury,
which is released from the
filling into the body.
Mercury in dental fillings is a
source of environmental
exposure in humans, and
mercury is incredibly toxic to
the human body. The big
dental associations continue
to support almalgam because,
frankly, they don’t want to
appear like they’ve been
wrong all these years, despite
all the well-documented



==================================================
                    PAGE 3594                     
==================================================

risks. This also means that
most dentists are not
equipped to remove these
fillings and in fact will try to
talk you out of it (mine did).
Removing mercury is
dangerous. It is critical to
find a dentist who knows
what he or she is doing and is
equipped to handle this
procedure. There are new
dentists sprouting up that can
be found by doing an Internet
search for “biological



==================================================
                    PAGE 3595                     
==================================================

dentist.” These are the ones
specifically set up to do this.
Ask and make sure they
know what they are doing.
They should have a specific
system in place for extracting
mercury safely. I switched
dentists. My process took a
few hours and my fillings
were replaced with ceramics.
Anyway, that’s the health
story. I’m stepping up my
game in 2012 and doing



==================================================
                    PAGE 3596                     
==================================================

more longer runs, biking, and
yoga, and I’m going to start
signing up for races to stay
motivated. After all, my kids
are still young, and I’m going
to have to be able to outrun
them when they are
teenagers.
For anyone who is
interested in more
information, a good place to
start is a book called Alkalize

on Google and search for
“acid and alkaline foods” or
“high-pH foods,” and you
will get all the information
you need. If you are
interested in the tests I took,
feel free to contact me and I
can give you more
information. My own
research has convinced me
that by eliminating refined

==================================================

increasing our intake of clean
water, and doing some
general exercise (300
minutes of vigorous exercise
a week!), we are preventing
more health issues than just
about anything else we could
do. Good health and good
trading go hand in hand. Bad
health sneaks up on people;
it’s under the hood and may
not show up for 20 years. But
when it does show up, it can
be very ugly.

Concluding Thoughts on
My Plan
This is the plan. For me, the
key here is complete and
accurate daily records so that
I can assess my trading,
review my progress on a
month-to-month basis, and
make changes in my
strategies based on my
performance. I also want to
incorporate other areas of my
life into my trading plan,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3600                     
==================================================

since trading is a very central
and important part of my life.
I’ve shared my actual plan
with a number of traders who
have come up to the office to
trade with me for a week.
One of my goals in working
with traders is to help them
identify the markets, setups,
and time frames that best suit
their personality, and then
from there help them to put
together a game plan. Once



==================================================
                    PAGE 3601                     
==================================================

they leave, they then e-mail
their business plan to me, and
I critique it for them and send
it back. One of the traders
who went through this
process is Eric Grywalski.
I’ve asked Eric if he would
be willing to share the plan
he created, because it is very
specific to the beginning
trader.
In spending time with
him, I could see right away



==================================================
                    PAGE 3602                     
==================================================

that he was highly intelligent
and highly perceptive.
Unfortunately, after the first
few hours of trading, I could
also see that he overanalyzed
everything. Instead of
jumping into a trade on a
predetermined signal, Eric
would continue to analyze
the market to make sure that
the trade setup was really a
winner. When he finally did
get into a trade and was
stopped out, his first



==================================================
                    PAGE 3603                     
==================================================

statement was, “What am I
doing wrong?” This tendency
to overanalyze the markets is
a problem for a specific
group of traders, especially
analytical and logical
thinkers who are looking to
make sense out of the “chaos
and randomness” of the
markets. To combat this, I
had him focus on simple
setups that required minimal
analytics, and to formulate an
exit plan with the same idea



==================================================
                    PAGE 3604                     
==================================================

in mind—exits that were
mechanical or that met a
specific set of simple criteria.
Eric had had some trading
experience on a swing basis
before he came to visit me,
so he’d already had some
experience with the market
under his belt. However, he
was very new to intraday
trading, and this is what he
wanted to focus on. His plan
follows, and I’ll turn this
over to him. Items in italics



==================================================
                    PAGE 3605                     
==================================================

in his plan are my notes from
the initial feedback I gave
him on his first draft.
A Sample Plan from a
Beginning Trader
My name is Erik Grywalski,
and my trading plan was
developed with the new
trader in mind, using John’s
plan as a model. Defining a
handful of solid setups,
creating rules to govern my



==================================================
                    PAGE 3606                     
==================================================

behavior in a limitless
environment, and integrating
proper trader psychology are
key themes in my plan. As a
beginning trader, I also
wanted to focus on keeping
my expectations realistic by
not focusing on “making a
killing in the market.”
Forming good habits early on
and learning from my
mistakes will be critical for
staying in the markets long
term, which is every aspiring



==================================================
                    PAGE 3607                     
==================================================

trader’s ultimate objective.
Overall, my plan lays out
three high-probability setups
that I learned from John
Carter and Hubert Senters
during the week I spent
trading with them. Gap,
pivot, and squeeze plays
allow traders to take
advantage of market
behavior that occurs on a
fairly consistent basis
throughout the trading day.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3608                     
==================================================

Gap plays position a trader
for the contra move that
often follows morning gaps,
while pivot plays anticipate
potential turning points in the
markets that are identified
before the trading day.
Squeeze plays allow traders
to capitalize on the market’s
tendency to fluctuate
between low- and high-
volatility states.
Last, more important than



==================================================
                    PAGE 3609                     
==================================================

the actual trade setup is
trader psychology. Without
establishing and maintaining
a proper trader’s mindset,
consistent success in the
markets will be
unachievable. I strongly
believe that this is an area
that new traders often
overlook because of their
obsession with instant profits
and is therefore briefly
included in my plan. I would
like to acknowledge Mark



==================================================
                    PAGE 3610                     
==================================================

Douglas for his superb book,
Trading in the Zone. All the
core attitudes listed in my
plan were taken from Mark’s
book, and all traders should
put this book at the top of
their reading list. Comments
in italics are notes from John
Carter that he inserted after
reading the first draft of my
plan.

I am trading because of my
passion for the financial
markets and my long-lived
aspiration to become a
profitable, full-time trader.
Trading will allow me to
actively manage my money
in all market situations, while
having the freedom to work
for myself in an area in
which I have great interest.
Being a student of the

==================================================

markets, I have gained an
appreciation for some of the
things that are critical for
success as a trader. Proper
mindset, strict money
management, and trading
with a predefined plan are
just some of the more
important areas to focus on
when trading the markets.
Since I have limited
intraday trading experience, I
realize that the road ahead



==================================================
                    PAGE 3613                     
==================================================

will be extremely
challenging, and I have set
expectations for my first year
accordingly. The most
important, often overlooked
area that will be critical for
me will be to establish and
maintain a trader’s mindset.
The ability to internalize and
master the psychological
aspects of trading is one of
the most crucial skills that
determine success.
Indicators, charts, and the

myriad other tools are
helpful, but I must be careful
not to overanalyze the
market, and I must realize
that trading is 90 percent
mental. In general, proper
attitude will produce better
overall results than analysis
or technique. With that said,
my main goals during this
first year are to learn how to
execute trades well while
achieving modest
profitability. This means

E-mini S&P 500

(ES)
Eric, the YM is a great
contract to trade for newer
traders. However, you need
to have a backup plan. In
situations where the eCBOT
goes down or you have any
computer problems, you will
want to be able to hedge any
“trapped” YM positions with
the ES using one of the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3617                     
==================================================

following options:
1. Take an opposite
position in the ES
market to offset a YM
position. As an
example, if I am long
two YM contracts, I
will sell two ES
contracts to hedge.
2. Use buy/sell stops in
the ES market to
hedge a YM position.
As an example, if I

==================================================

am long two YM
contracts and the
eCBOT goes down, I
will place a sell stop
for two ES contracts
at a price level that is
equivalent to my
initial YM stop. This
way, if the YM hits
my stop and I can’t
get out of my
position, I am hedged
at my stop in the ES.
However, if the

==================================================
                    PAGE 3629                     
==================================================

this trade should be set with a
1:15 p.m. Pacific close and a
6:30 a.m. Pacific opening to
account for any
overnight/morning gaps in
price.
Gap Trade Guidelines
1. Using two-year raw
gap data, take gap
trades only from
Tuesday through
Friday and take only



==================================================
                    PAGE 3630                     
==================================================

those gaps that occur
at or between R1 and
S1 pivot levels.
Exceptions to this
rule can be made if
price opens near
another significant
level that has a high
probability of
providing support or
resistance. As an
example, the market
gaps down below S1,
but prices open right



==================================================
                    PAGE 3631                     
==================================================

on the weekly pivot,
which also coincides
with key daily chart
support and/or a
moving average (or
fib level).
2. YM gaps should be at
least 20 points and
not more than 60
points.
3. Risk a maximum of
1.5 percent of total
trading capital per



==================================================
                    PAGE 3632                     
==================================================

trade.
4. Around 6:20 a.m.
Pacific time, evaluate
premarket volume in
key institutional
stocks to gauge the
power of the gap.
Specifically, review
volume for MXIM,
NVLS, KLAC, and
AMAT along with
other stocks tracked
in One Chicago’s



==================================================
                    PAGE 3633                     
==================================================

single-stock futures
listing. Use the
underlying volume of
the cash market, not
the futures market.
Volume Guidelines
• Light = < 30,000 shares
• Moderate = 30,000 to
80,000 shares
• Heavy = 80,000+ shares
Note: As a new trader, use



==================================================
                    PAGE 3634                     
==================================================

a full position (two contracts)
only on those gaps where
there are less than 30,000
shares in premarket volume
for the key stocks. These
trades have the highest
probability of filling the
same day. With moderate-
volume openings, trade only
one contract and use ½ gap
fill as the target. Heavy-
volume openings are not to
be faded.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3635                     
==================================================

1. Premarket volume
takes precedence, but
be alert during the
gap trade if most of
the sectors are
moving in the
direction of the gap.
Ideally, look for at
least five sectors
moving in the
opposite direction
from the gap.
Consider closing the
position before stop



==================================================
                    PAGE 3636                     
==================================================

is hit if the five
sectors reverse and
start to trade in the
direction of the gap.
Eric, I would
throw this idea about
the sectors out—this
will end up being an
excuse to overanalyze
the play, and you will
end up getting out of
the trades that you
should have stayed in.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3637                     
==================================================

Just focus on the
premarket volume, set
your parameters, and
leave it alone.—JC
2. If gap occurs with
premarket volume
over 80,000 shares
and does not fill, look
for the first buy/sell
signal in the direction
of the gap. This may
be a pullback to a

==================================================

after a consolidation
of the morning’s gap.
3. When the daily pivot
precedes the prior
day’s close, look to
lock in any gap trade
profits at the daily
pivot.
4. Record unfilled gaps
and keep price level
handy, as the market
will often fill open
gaps within 5–10

days.
Avoid gaps on the
following days:
• Options expiration
Friday
• Rollover Thursday and
the day after
• First trading day of a
new month
• If after a narrow range
day, the next day’s gap
is larger than the

==================================================

• Gaps where the opening
price is outside the
previous session’s
high/low
Gap Trade Execution
Procedure:
1. When taking gaps,
enter opposite the
market using an “all-
in” market order and
place stop from fill



==================================================
                    PAGE 3641                     
==================================================

price.
2. Stop price will be
determined from the
gap’s size, as
follows:



==================================================
                    PAGE 3642                     
==================================================





==================================================
                    PAGE 3643                     
==================================================

3. After setting
parameters, stay in
trade until the gap
fills or stop is hit, but
do not hold overnight
and do not trail
stops.
4. For two contracts and
light volume gaps,
the target is a
complete gap fill.
This price level
should match the

                    PAGE 3644                     
==================================================

1:15 p.m. Pacific
closing price level
from the previous
day and should be set
upon entry of trade.
Use ½ gap fill as a
target for moderate
volume gaps.
B. PIVOT LEVEL TRADES
Daily, weekly, and monthly
floor trader pivots will be a
second strategy used for
intraday trading of the YM



==================================================
                    PAGE 3645                     
==================================================

market. Pivots are leading
price-based indicators that
help anticipate market
turns/points of consolidation
and can be valuable entry
points for both trending and
choppy days. The basic
strategy utilizes preplanned
(“anti-impulsive”) trades to
either fade pivot levels on
choppy days or buy/sell
pullbacks to pivots on strong
trend days. Daily pivots will
be calculated using the 24-



==================================================
                    PAGE 3646                     
==================================================

hour time period, while
weekly and monthly pivots
will use the high, low. and
close from each of the
previous week/month’s
trading range of the
continuous contract (@YM).

==================================================

– low)
Daily, weekly, and
monthly price levels will be
drawn on the intraday chart
each trading day.
Pivot Trade Guidelines
1. Use 144-tick chart for
pivot strategy.
Experimenting with
other time frames
(89- or 233-tick) is
okay to see what



==================================================
                    PAGE 3649                     
==================================================

works best.
2. Add in 8- and 21-
period EMAs for
confirmation (after
entry) and seven-
period RSI to spot
bullish/bearish
divergences. This is
fine, but make sure
you are using this for
confirmation after the
entry, and don’t use
these to wait to get



==================================================
                    PAGE 3650                     
==================================================

into the trade. — JC
3. Consider using pivot
strategy as the first
trade of the day if an
opening gap is a
runaway gap where
the gap does not fill
because of strong
buy/sell interest. On
these days, look for
price to pull back to a
pivot level where an
entry can take place



==================================================
                    PAGE 3651                     
==================================================

before the market
resumes in the
direction of the
opening gap.
4. Look to fade the first
move to the daily
pivot and stay in the
trade until a scalper
buy/sell signal is
generated.
5. If the market opens
above the daily pivot,
look for short entries



==================================================
                    PAGE 3652                     
==================================================

for a move down to
test the pivot and vice
versa for openings
below the pivot. If
the pivot isn’t tested
during the morning
session, look for a
test in the afternoon.
6. For levels that have
multiple pivots, such
as a daily and
weekly, defer entry
point to daily price



==================================================
                    PAGE 3653                     
==================================================

level.
7. In general, for trend
days, look to buy/sell
pullbacks to pivot
levels, and look to
scale out at pivot
levels above/below.
How are you
determining whether
a day is choppy or a
potential trend day?
This is another area
where overanalysis



==================================================
                    PAGE 3654                     
==================================================

can hurt a trader.
For choppy days, it is
okay to trade pivots,
but remember you
are fading the initial
move to the pivot on
these days.
Remember to look at
the ES volume and
see if it is greater
than 10,000 contracts
per five-minute bar
over the first six bars,
which indicates a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3655                     
==================================================

trend day, whereas
volume of less than
10,000 contracts
during the first six
bars sets up a choppy
day. —JC
8. Utilize market
internals to decide
what action to take at
pivots. For example,
if the trin is falling
and most sectors are
green, focus on



==================================================
                    PAGE 3656                     
==================================================

buying pull-backs to
pivots and ignoring
sell signals against
pivots. In a choppy
market, the internals
are less critical, so
look to fade rallies
and declines to
pivots.
9. Use midpoint pivots
if the range between
the seven daily pivots
exceeds 40 points.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3657                     
==================================================

Midpoints are not
used with weekly and
monthly price levels.
10. Moves to R3 or S3 are
extreme, so keep
emotions in check at
these extended levels.
11. Daily R2/S2 will
contain the market 90
percent of time, so be
aware of these levels
when trading
intraday.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3658                     
==================================================

12. Look for convergence
of daily, weekly, and
monthly pivots (and
fib clusters). These
levels are strong
support/resistance
areas to be aware of
when trading.
13. If five-minute squeeze
fires off in
conjunction with
pivot, stay in trade
until momentum runs



==================================================
                    PAGE 3659                     
==================================================

out.
14. After two losses in a
row, quit using pivot
strategy for that day.
Pivot Trade Execution
Procedure
1. Use “all-in” limit
orders to enter the
market. Limit orders
should be placed at
the targeted pivot
level +/– 3 pts. If



==================================================
                    PAGE 3660                     
==================================================

buying at daily
midpoints, just use
nominal value for
entry. If trading more
than 10 lots, use MIT
orders (market if
touched) to eliminate
partial fills for both
entries and targets.—
JC
2. Place an initial stop
20 points from the fill
price. This represents



==================================================
                    PAGE 3661                     
==================================================

a maximum
drawdown of
$100/contract or 0.25
percent of total
equity.
3. Sell/buy one contract
after a 10-point profit
and use the next pivot
level as the target for
the final contract.
4. After closing out the
first contract, move
the stop to breakeven



==================================================
                    PAGE 3662                     
==================================================

+/– 6 points.
5. Consider using
scalper buy/sell
signals on 233-tick
chart of ES to
confirm the trade in
YM at pivot levels.
Confirmation should
occur within 15–20
minutes. If
confirmation doesn’t
happen, close out
your position.

C. FIVE-MINUTE SQUEEZE
Squeeze trades rely on
TRADE
the premise that stocks and
indexes fluctuate between
periods of high volatility
followed by low volatility.
The squeeze indicator
captures the moment when
the market goes from a low-
volatility to a high-volatility
state. The squeeze trade is
the only trade acceptable to
take during the 8:30–11:00
a.m. Pacific doldrums.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3664                     
==================================================

Squeeze Trade
Guidelines
• Use the continuous
contract (@YM)
symbol when
charting. Focus on
signals in the five-
minute time frame
for intraday trades.
• Red dots signify the
contract is in a
squeeze (Bollinger



==================================================
                    PAGE 3665                     
==================================================

Bands are inside
Keltner Channels).
• Blue dots signify
that the Bollinger
Bands have moved
outside the Keltner
Channels and
volatility is
increasing.
• Histogram measures
move’s momentum.
Green bars on blue
dots are long



==================================================
                    PAGE 3666                     
==================================================

signals, and red
bars on blue dots
are short signals.
Squeeze Trade Execution
Procedure
1. Monitor a continuous
five-minute YM chart
for red dots. You
should have at least
two red dots before
considering a
potential squeeze.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3667                     
==================================================

2. Once a dot turns blue
and closes blue for
one five-minute
period, use an “all-
in” market order to
go long (two
contracts) if the
histogram is green
and short if the
histogram is red.
Histogram appears
above/below dots.
3. Set an initial stop of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3668                     
==================================================

20 points.
4. Scale out of one
contract at a 10-point
profit and move the
stop to break-even
minus 10 for the
second contract.
5. For the second
contract, stay in the
trade until
momentum runs out
on the histogram.
This is indicated by



==================================================
                    PAGE 3669                     
==================================================

the histogram’s
failure to make
consecutive higher
highs if long or
consecutive lower
lows if short. Wait
for two consecutive
higher/lower bars
before exiting at the
market on the second
contract.

                    PAGE 3670                     
==================================================

important role in trading, and
the development of a proper
trader’s mindset should not
be taken for granted. The
unsuccessful trader has firm
beliefs and expectations that
are often not met by the
market. When the outcome
doesn’t match the
expectation, the trader feels
pain and often views the
market in a threatening way.
Once this occurs, traders are
doomed to fail unless they



==================================================
                    PAGE 3671                     
==================================================

can recognize what is wrong
and develop the proper
winning attitude of a
successful trader.
Adopt the following for
trading success:
• Every Moment Is
Unique: Either the
trade works or it
doesn’t.
• Anything Can
Happen: Develop a
resolute, unshakable



==================================================
                    PAGE 3672                     
==================================================

belief in uncertainty.
The market has no
responsibility to give us
anything or do anything
that would benefit us.
• Markets Are Neutral:
The market does not
generate happy or
painful information;
therefore, no threat
exists. Our expectations
formed from our
original beliefs are the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3673                     
==================================================

sole source of any
happiness or pain.
• Losses Are Okay:
Losing and being
wrong are inevitable
realities of trading,
since anything can
happen. Taking small
losses is part of a
successful trader’s job.
• Accept Risk: Fully
acknowledge the risks
inherent in trading and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3674                     
==================================================

accept complete
responsibility for each
trade (not the market).
When a loss occurs, do
not suffer emotional
discomfort or fear.
• Monitor Emotions:
Learn how to monitor
and control the negative
effects of euphoria and
the potential for self-
sabotage.
• Abandon Search for



==================================================
                    PAGE 3675

produces better overall
results than analysis or
technique.
• Rigid Rules, Flexible
Expectations: Adopt
rigidity in your trading
rules and flexibility in
your expectations.

Eric, this is good, but you
will also want to grade how
well you follow the setups
you have chosen—in other
words, how well you execute
your plan. This is
particularly important given

==================================================

your tendency to overanalyze
what you are doing. You also
tend to blame yourself when
you lose money, i.e., “What
am I doing wrong?” If you
follow the setup the same
way each time, then the focus

the setup, not you personally.
This way you focus on
tweaking the setup, not
blaming yourself. I would

trade play out to see
what happens.
• Do not rush into a trade
unless parameters are
defined before the trade
is placed. There will
always be another
opportunity down the
road, and there is no
reason to chase the

==================================================

market.
• Trade on the path of
least resistance. For
intraday trading, use
moving averages on 5-,
15-, and 60-minute
charts to confirm the
market’s short-term
trend. If market
dynamics are strong
and moving averages
are rising on all time
frames, do not take

                    PAGE 3697                     
==================================================

short signals. For mixed
markets, take long and
short setups in line with
buying/selling pressure
on that particular day.
Also, use a squeeze
indicator to help with
determining short-term
market bias. If a daily
squeeze exists on YM,
focus on long setups
and pass on shorts.
• Be aware of monthly

==================================================

and weekly pressures to
be on the right side of
the market.
• Focus on executing
trades efficiently and
not on P&L.
• Do not trade during
lunchtime doldrums

• Minimize trading on
Fed days. Maybe look

the last hour for any
opportunities.
• During options
expiration week, reduce
your position size to
one contract and
consider trading only
Monday to Wednesday
of that week. Do not
trade on Thursday and

• Trade light during the

especially the last two
weeks, as volume dries
up and the trading gets
choppy. Focus on
preparing for
September trading
when volume and
players return to the
markets.
• Consider taking time off

his plan, and, as a result, he
will not be staring at the
markets each day wondering
what he should be doing.
This mental flailing around is
what initiates most of the
mistakes all amateurs tend to
make. If you are a new trader
without a plan, remember
that you are going to be
trading directly against Eric

who have put a lot of thought

Will Cry for Food—Using
Your Emotions to Make
Money
The biggest problem traders
have is controlling their
emotions. I see it all the time.
Traders know the setup they



==================================================
                    PAGE 3712                     
==================================================

are supposed to follow, but
they get swept up in their
emotions and blow the trade.
By stepping back and
examining this process in
more detail, traders can learn
to use their emotional
reactions as indicators.
Properly tuned, these
emotional indicators, instead
of leading to mistakes, can
create great triggers to enter
and exit a market. This is
part of the transition from



==================================================
                    PAGE 3713                     
==================================================

amateur to professional—
instead of getting sucked into
a trade because of your
emotions, use the emotional
triggers to fight back and do
exactly the opposite of what
they are signaling you to do.
The Four Seasons Hotel
Trade
When I am in a trade that is
going my way and I start to
feel overly excited and have



==================================================
                    PAGE 3714                     
==================================================

the urge to add to my
position, I instead use this as
my trigger to set up a
“double stop order.” As an
example, let’s say I’m long
10 E-mini S&P contracts.
The market is screaming
higher. I find myself thinking
of how many nights I could
live at the Four Seasons on
Maui with the day’s profits. I
recognize this feeling and
immediately take the “Four
Seasons trigger”: I place a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3715                     
==================================================

trailing 2-point stop for 20
contracts, double the size of
my current position.
What happens is that I
will stay in the trade as long
as it is moving higher, but
once the market turns, not
only am I out of my position
for a nice profit, but I also
simultaneously get short 10
contracts. This process takes
advantage of the market
dynamics of human emotion



==================================================
                    PAGE 3716                     
==================================================

in a very clean fashion. The
sell-off that occurs will be
driven by other traders who
succumbed to their emotions
and bought at the top,
because of either fear of
missing a move or the
euphoria of having a current
winning position. Once the
market does reverse, it will
be these traders who will
provide the fuel for the move
down as they start dumping
their positions once they



==================================================
                    PAGE 3717                     
==================================================

can’t take the pain of losing
any longer. This is one
example of how to get your
emotions working for you
instead of against you.
Thank You, Sir, May I
Have Another?
When I’m in a trade, I
visualize what a newer trader
would be doing—or what I
would have been doing when
I first started out. “If I



==================================================
                    PAGE 3718                     
==================================================

entered here, where would
my pain point be?” I’ve
found that on the S&Ps, a
move of 6 points without any
meaningful retracements is
the maximum “uncle point”
for most traders. When I see
a 6-point move without a
retracement, I picture new
traders and try to imagine the
pain they are feeling. After
about 6 points, I know they
won’t be able to take the pain
any longer, and I step in and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3719                     
==================================================

take the opposite side of this
move, just as they are bailing
out of their position and
throwing cabbage at their
screen. One person’s stop run
is another person’s entry
point.
As a professional trader,
you will always be using a
stop, so you will no longer
find yourself in this very real,
very frequent, and very
unfortunate position. Use



==================================================
                    PAGE 3720                     
==================================================

your emotions to feel other
traders’ pain and figure out
when they are going to throw
in the towel.
When I Tick, You Tick, We
Tick
A more technical way to
measure emotion is to watch
the ticks. This is the same
setup we talked about in
Chapter 9. This time,
however, if you are sitting



==================================================
                    PAGE 3721                     
==================================================

there and the market is
running away from you,
instead of blindly jumping in,
look at the ticks. Are they
approaching +1,000? They
are probably getting close, as
pools of amateur traders
continue to buy at the market
and tempt the goddess of
good luck. The ticks are a
great emotional balancing
mechanism. A frequent surge
of adrenaline that comes
from watching a market



==================================================
                    PAGE 3722                     
==================================================

that’s moving without you
can be quickly tempered by a
quick look at the ticks.
Dive, Captain, Dive
My trading partners and I run
an Internet-based trading
room where people log in
from around the world. One
of the things we all like to do
is watch how the newer
traders react to the market
action. There are “noises”



==================================================
                    PAGE 3723                     
==================================================

that the people in the room
can use. One of the classic
actions is that when the
market is falling, falling,
falling, one of the free trial
users in the room posts that
she is going short and
initiates the “submarine dive,
dive, dive” noise.
Immediately upon hearing
this, I know it is time to
cover my shorts and go long.
The experienced traders in
the room also know this, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3724                     
==================================================

we all jump in and take the
trade. The market usually
reverses quickly, and once
the newbie traders say that
they are stopped out of the
short trade, we cover our
longs. It’s emotion-based
trading at its finest. Of
course, we then share this
information with the newbie
traders. Once they catch on,
we just have to wait for the
next free trial to show up.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3725                     
==================================================

As a trader, if you find
that you are constantly
shorting the lows and buying
the highs, picture newbie
traders getting so excited that
they are about to literally
“push the dive, dive, dive
button.” Do you want to be
trading with or against these
people?
High Five, Baby
Whenever traders I work



==================================================
                    PAGE 3726                     
==================================================

with—or myself, for that
matter—start slapping one
another on the back as the
result of a good open trade
that is racking up profits, I
immediately snap alert and
close out my position. This is
the result of extreme
emotion, and extreme
emotion is not sustainable. I
call this the “high five sell
signal.”
Any time you actually

utter a noise or pound on
something as the result of a
trade that is going really
well, it’s a wake-up call for
you to turn back into a
professional trader.
Discover Your Personality
Type and Find Out If It’s
Holding You Back
One of the themes I’ve
discussed in this book is the
importance of finding the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3728                     
==================================================

right markets and the right
setups that best fit a trader’s
personality. People view the
trades they are taking
through one of the three
dominant personality traits
that all human beings share.
Some of these personality
types are naturally better
suited to the world of trading
than others. Unfortunately,
there are also personality
types that will not win at
trading no matter what they



==================================================
                    PAGE 3729                     
==================================================

do. However, there is a silver
lining here. The reason these
personality types lose is that
they are unaware that their
personality is the very thing
that is responsible for their
mounting losses and
continued frustration. Once a
trader learns about this, he
can then use this information
to turn his trading around.
The following 20-question
quiz will help you determine



==================================================
                    PAGE 3730                     
==================================================

your dominant personality
type. There is no right
answer, and it may seem to
you that there are two right
answers to some of the
questions. Just pick the one
that makes the most sense in
terms of how it relates to
you. Don’t think about these
too long. The faster you can
move through this, the more
accurate the readings will be,
and the better the information
you will have to improve



==================================================
                    PAGE 3731

17. When I get anxious,
the first thing I notice
is:
A. The world seems
slightly different
to me.
B. Various sounds
and noises start to
irritate me.
C. I no longer feel a
sense of ease and

                    PAGE 3751                     
==================================================

calm.
18. When I get focused
and motivated, I
immediately:
A. View things from a
brand new and
positive
perspective.
B. Tell myself that
this new state of
being is going to
open up new
doors.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3752                     
==================================================

C. Feel my body and
mind getting
excited.
19. When someone tells
me, “I love you,” my
first reaction is:
A. To form an image
of the two of us
being together or
of that person
loving me.
B. To hear my soul
saying something



==================================================
                    PAGE 3753                     
==================================================

like, “This is
amazing.”
C. A feeling of great
satisfaction and
contentment.
20. Dying, for me, is
closest to:
A. Seeing no more or
seeing things in a
brand new fashion.
B. Hearing nothing
ever again or
hearing things in a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3754                     
==================================================

brand new fashion.
C. Feeling nothing
ever again or
feeling things in a
brand new fashion.
Once you have completed
this test, add up how many
times you answered A, B, or
C. For example, you might
have A: 6, B: 4, C: 10. These
results will give you an idea
about your dominant

generally react to and
interpret the world around
them through this filter. Get
your scores together and
we’ll move on—you’ll want

Personality Types and
Trading—What You Don’t
Know
About Yourself Can Hurt
Your Trading
Nearly 60 percent of the
population will have “A” as
their highest-scoring trait.
This indicates that a person’s
dominant way of viewing the
world is visual. It’s not really



==================================================
                    PAGE 3757                     
==================================================

known why this is so, but
experts feel that it has to do
with sight being our strongest
sense, and that the majority
of us were taught from birth
to depend on our eyes in
order to make our way
through life. Also, in today’s
world, our input is largely
through television, movies,
computer screens, and
printed copy—all of which
are heavily dependent on the
eyes.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3758                     
==================================================

Visual people like
daylight and are extremely
mobile, and it’s easy to find
them in professions that
allow them visual expression.
Nowhere is this more
observable than in the
entertainment industry.
Visual people are generally
“movers and shakers” and
like to move fast. They are
drawn to this industry and its
related fields as a natural
expression of who they are.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3759                     
==================================================

These types of people
naturally gravitate to
professions such as painting,
photography, and design.
They also make great
marksmen, firefighters, and
pilots.
In terms of trading, visual
people adapt most quickly to
this profession, as they
depend largely on what is
happening visually in front of
them on the computer screen



==================================================
                    PAGE 3760                     
==================================================

to make decisions. This
doesn’t mean that they will
make the right decisions, but
they are most naturally
adapted to the world of
trading. If they are untrained
in how the markets work,
they will make the same
mistakes as everyone else.
Once they get some
experience, however, they
tend to be good at waiting for
the charts to set up before
taking their entries. Yet, only



==================================================
                    PAGE 3761                     
==================================================

experience teaches them how
to manage their exits. A
visual’s biggest weakness is
watching the P&L fluctuate
throughout the trading day. It
would be better for her to
cover that up (a business card
taped to the corner of the
computer screen works well)
and just focus on the setups.
Also, visuals tend to laser in
on a price chart and ignore
everything else, which can be
a detriment to their trading.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3762                     
==================================================

This is why it is helpful to
have auditory alerts on things
like high tick readings and to
listen to pit noise in the
background so that visuals
don’t get sucked into the
extreme price action they are
seeing on the charts.
If your highest score was
“B,” then your dominant
personality trait is auditory.
My accountant is highly
auditory, and I’ve noticed



==================================================
                    PAGE 3763                     
==================================================

that the sounds around the
office occupy most of his
attention. Auditory
personality types relate to the
world through the way things
sound and in many respects
are more sensitive to sounds
than visual people are to
sight. Auditory people can be
easily distracted by the most
inoffensive sound, which can
make it seem as if they are
not paying attention to you
during a conversation. In



==================================================
                    PAGE 3764                     
==================================================

reality, though, they are
strong verbal communicators
— it’s just that they hear
every sound coming their
way, and sometimes it
distracts them. They enjoy
both talking with others and
just talking out loud to
themselves. Because of their
innate internal ability to put
thoughts into dialogue,
experts believe that most
loners have this dominant
personality type. Because of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3765                     
==================================================

their heightened sensitivity to
sound, auditories don’t
tolerate harsh or disharmonic
noise as well as others do.
Fire or ambulance sirens are
major offenders, and you can
spot an auditory easily by
observing who on a street
corner is holding his ears as
an ambulance screams past.
Also, they have an incredible
ability to listen so thoroughly
and with such intent that data
are absorbed and processed



==================================================
                    PAGE 3766                     
==================================================

in their minds very quickly,
without needing to be
translated into pictures.
Because of this enhanced
ability, auditories tend to
gravitate to areas in life that
permit the use of such superb
listening and communicative
talents.
With regard to trading,
this personality type has one
strong advantage— the
ability to sit alone in front of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3767                     
==================================================

a computer for days at a time
without going crazy. That is
an important part of trading,
and this ability to be patient
and wait and not feel isolated
is a necessary trait to have.
The downside of this
personality type and trading
is that a chart isn’t really
much use to an auditory, and
such a person will frequently
miss setups simply through
not paying attention.
Whereas a visual can stare at



==================================================
                    PAGE 3768                     
==================================================

a chart for hours because the
red and green lights are
fascinating, an auditory
personality needs additional
input. Audio alerts and pit
noise are important tools for
auditories, and I know some
of these personality types
who don’t even look at price
charts. They just listen for
audio alerts and then place
their trades.
If your highest score was



==================================================
                    PAGE 3769                     
==================================================

“C,” then you relate to the
world around you by how
you feel. People with this
dominant personality trait
long to be understood and
respected for being so in
touch with their feelings.
They tend to like a person
because of how they feel
when they are around that
person, or they like a movie
because of how it made them
feel when they were
watching it. When they



==================================================
                    PAGE 3770                     
==================================================

laugh, they let themselves go
and really feel the laughter,
giving the person they are
talking to a sense that they
totally understand and agree
with what was so funny.
Type C personalities are able
to translate visual images and
acoustical data into feelings
that are pertinent to them and
those around them. Type Cs
enjoy conversations, but not
for the same reason that
visuals or auditories do. They



==================================================
                    PAGE 3771                     
==================================================

use dialogue to translate
words, sounds, and images
into feelings. While visuals
and auditories are busy
communicating with pictures
and sounds, the type C
personality is busily running
through her vast storehouse
of feelings and attaching
sensory meaning to what the
other person has just said.
Because of their
heightened ability to feel,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3772                     
==================================================

you would assume that type
Cs are introverts. However,
the opposite is true.
Moreover, because of their
superior sense of touch, type
Cs make superior athletes.
Any occupation that requires
manual tasks is just plain
easier for people with this
personality type. Typical
occupations that are tailor-
made for them usually have
hands-on or feeling
parameters. Psychologists,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3773                     
==================================================

woodworkers, potters,
surgeons, actors, all types of
mechanics, and other feeling-
or sensory-based occupations
are common among them.
For traders, people with
this type of personality have
the biggest struggle, and they
usually don’t make it until
they figure out how their
personality is working
against them. A trader with a
type C personality will wait



==================================================
                    PAGE 3774                     
==================================================

until he senses that things are
good or bad, or wait until he
gets a sense about whether
what he is doing or is about
to do is good or bad. Such a
trader will literally get into
trades when it feels good to
do so, and get out when it
feels bad. This almost always
puts them in just as a move is
ending, and gets them out
just as it is turning. For
people with a type C
personality, it feels bad to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3775                     
==================================================

buy a market that is selling
off into a pivot level. They
would rather wait to see a
bounce so that they can “feel
good” that the trade is going
to work out. Of course, by
the time this happens, they
should actually be closing
out a position instead of
initiating a new one. The
solution to this is hard yet
simple. If you are a type C,
then just acknowledge that
your feelings need to be



==================================================
                    PAGE 3776                     
==================================================

faded. If you are excited and
feel good about going long,
then you should be looking at
the short side, and vice versa.
If you are a type C, don’t
despair. A type C who
masters this will have a
distinct advantage over other
traders. A type C who is
unaware of this will always
face an uphill battle when it
comes to trading.
In terms of personality, no

==================================================

one is going to be 100
percent anything. I am
primarily visual, then
“feeling” is not far behind,
and finally auditory makes
up a small portion of my
overall personality profile.
I’ve learned to set up my
charts to take the best
advantage of my dominant
visual personality, listen to
my feelings to get an idea of
what the amateur traders are
doing and thus “fade my

                    PAGE 3778                     
==================================================

feelings,” and set up audio
alerts to make sure my eyes
aren’t the only thing that are
responsible for my trading
decisions. Learning this
about myself made me a
better trader.
Trading Really Isn’t That
Easy—Alternatives to
Consider for Jump-Starting
Progress
The harsh truth is that trading



==================================================
                    PAGE 3779                     
==================================================

isn’t for everyone, but the
problem is, you won’t know
whether it’s for you or not
until you give it a shot. It
takes guts, courage, and
years to become good
enough to do it for a living.
My advice is to start out
small. Whatever amount you
start with is your tuition
money—you are going to
lose it, and that is your
educational fee for entrance
into this world. Do yourself a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3780                     
==================================================

favor and trade small until
you start getting consistent
with your setups. If it still
isn’t working out after a few
years and you are getting
ulcers, or if you figure out
that you’d rather be playing
golf, there are other options.
First off, learning about
trading by reading a book is
about like learning about
golfing by reading a book.
Both require what are called



==================================================
                    PAGE 3781                     
==================================================

complex execution skills.
Reading will help in the
understanding, but not the
doing. Other examples of this
are:
• Learning a native
language or a second
language
• Driving a car
• Playing a sport
(baseball, football,
hockey, and so on)



==================================================
                    PAGE 3782                     
==================================================

• Snow skiing or water
skiing
• Playing a musical
instrument
• Math
• Morality
• Computer programming
• Playing poker or bridge
• Flying a plane and
getting a pilot’s license
• Trading and investing



==================================================
                    PAGE 3783                     
==================================================

• Tuning a piano or
working on a car engine
• Being a doctor or a
lawyer
Activities that require
complex execution skills are
learned by 99 percent of the
population in exactly the
same way. How is that? They
have to have at least one
other human being physically
beside them teaching them



==================================================
                    PAGE 3784                     
==================================================

for an extended period of
time.
For trading, this often
isn’t practical. It’s easy to
practice in isolation. It’s hard
to find someone who (1) can
really trade and (2) will let
you sit next to her for an
extended period of time. This
need to have someone with
you is why the Stockholm
syndrome happens. Physical
contact with kidnappers



==================================================
                    PAGE 3785                     
==================================================

changes the perspective of
those who are held in
captivity because the
captured feel what their
kidnappers feel and end up
mimicking their kidnappers’
rules, sentiments, actions,
and so forth. It’s the way
human beings learn and
operate. Humans see others
around them and discover
what, why, and how they do
things, and this is how
humans learn and start to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3786                     
==================================================

mimic. Those who don’t
have physical contact with
kidnappers may read and
understand what the cause of
the capture is, but that pales
in comparison to the changes
that are taking place in the
minds of the victims who are
being held hostage.
For me, I had to spend
time and sit side by side with
other traders before I turned
the corner to consistency. In



==================================================
                    PAGE 3787                     
==================================================

sitting beside these traders, it
was helpful to hear them talk
about what they were doing
and why, but that was only
about 40 percent of what I
learned. The rest of it had to
do with what they weren’t
saying or doing. They
weren’t getting upset if they
missed a move. They weren’t
answering the phone when it
rang. Also, there were many
things they did and habits
they had that they weren’t



==================================================
                    PAGE 3788                     
==================================================

even aware of until I pointed
it out to them. It was these
unconscious trading habits
that I picked up that really
helped me out as well—just
observing and absorbing how
a professional trader spent
his day. To that end, if you
really want to do this, I
would encourage you to find
an experienced trader and
just spend a week sitting next
to him. That was what turned
the corner for me. If you



==================================================
                    PAGE 3789                     
==================================================

can’t find anyone, there are a
few times a year when we
will hold weeklong
“mentorships” at my trading
office (see Figure 25.1).
Traders can sign up to come
and spend time side by side
with me and some of the
other traders I work with and
just watch what we do. After
a few days, we will then have
the visiting traders start
making trades while we
observe and make comments.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3790                     
==================================================

If they do a good job
following their own rules,
we’ll let them make some
trades in one of the various
funds that we run. Part of
their homework while they
are with us is to develop a
full trading plan like the one
I shared earlier. The goal is
that when they leave, they
will never again have to
wonder what they should be
doing when they are staring
at the charts. They will have



==================================================
                    PAGE 3791                     
==================================================

a plan to follow, and they
will just wait for specific
things to happen “according
to plan.”

and how the other team tried
to work against them. This is
great information to have as

ways to improve. Be more
patient? Don’t chase? It’s a
great way to get to the next

The sum of my trading
experience is this: I’ve
learned that being a
professional is all about
maintaining a specific state
of mind while trading, and
traders are never going to
make consistent money until
they achieve that frame of
reference from which to
operate. All the successful
traders I know blew out their
account at least once before
they became consistently

I’ve composed a list of 40
“trading tips” for staying in
this professional state of
mind. These “tips” are not
meant to make a trader
conservative or hesitant. On
the contrary, trading takes
guts, and by following these
tips, traders will be given the
key that will allow them to
embrace risk and take the
necessary chances required
in the pursuit of capital gain.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3801

That is, traders will feel more
compelled to take a chance
because they know they are
also going to fight to protect
their capital. They won’t
freeze and lie helpless as it is
whittled away.
This is a list I’ve
developed specifically for
myself. When I use the term
you, I’m referring to “me.”

==================================================

Maintaining a Professional
State of Mind
1. Trading is simple, but
it’s not easy. If you
want to stay in this
business, leave hope
at the door, focus on
specific setups, and
stick to your stops.
2. When you get into a
day trade, watch for
an 800 reading in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3805                     
==================================================

opposite direction
from your trade for
signs that you are
wrong. This might
allow you to get out
of your trade before
your stop is hit.
3. Trading should be
boring, like factory
work. If there is one
guarantee in trading,
it is that thrill seekers
and impulse traders



==================================================
                    PAGE 3806                     
==================================================

get their accounts
ground into parking
meter money.
4. Amateur traders turn
into professional
traders once they stop
looking for the “next
great technical
indicator” and start
controlling their risk
on each trade.
5. You are trading other
traders, not the actual



==================================================
                    PAGE 3807                     
==================================================

stock or futures
contract. Who is
taking the other side
of your trade? Is it an
amateur who is
chasing or a
professional who has
been patiently
waiting for this entry
all day? You have to
be aware of the
psychology and
emotions on both
sides of the trade.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3808                     
==================================================

6. Be very aware of
your own emotions.
Irrational behavior is
every trader’s
downfall. If you are
yelling at your
computer screen,
imploring your stocks
to move in your
direction, you have to
ask yourself, “Is this
rational?” Ease in.
Ease out. Keep your
stops. No yelling.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3809                     
==================================================

The person who is
screaming should be
the one on the other
side of your trade.
7. Watch yourself if you
get too excited—
excitement increases
risk because it clouds
judgment. If you are
feeling peak
excitement, it
probably means that
the move is just about



==================================================
                    PAGE 3810                     
==================================================

over. Tighten your
stop and look to
reverse.
8. Don’t overtrade—be
patient and wait for
three to five good
trades.
9. If you come into
trading with the idea
of making big
money, you are
doomed. When
accounts are blown



==================================================
                    PAGE 3811                     
==================================================

out, this mindset is
responsible most of
the time.
10. Don’t focus on the
money. Focus on
executing trades well.
If you are getting into
and out of trades
rationally, the money
will take care of
itself.
11. If you focus on the
money, you will start



==================================================
                    PAGE 3812                     
==================================================

trying to impose your
will upon the market
in order to meet your
financial needs.
There is only one
outcome for this
scenario: you will
hand over all your
money to traders who
are focused on
protecting their risk
and letting their
winners run.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3813                     
==================================================

12. The best way to
minimize risk is not
to trade. This is
especially true during
the doldrums,
between 11:30 a.m.
and 2:30 p.m.
eastern. If your
stocks or other
markets aren’t acting
right, then don’t trade
them. Just sit and
watch them and try to
learn something. By



==================================================
                    PAGE 3814                     
==================================================

doing this, you are
being proactive in
reducing your risk
and protecting your
capital. The most
common problem
with losing traders is
that they feel that
they always have to
be in a trade.
13. There is no need to
trade five days a
week. Trade four



==================================================
                    PAGE 3815                     
==================================================

days a week, and you
will be sharper during
the actual time you
are trading.
14. Refuse to damage
your capital. This
means sticking to
your stops and
sometimes staying
out of the market.
15. Stay relaxed. Place a
trade and set a stop.
If you get stopped



==================================================
                    PAGE 3816                     
==================================================

out, that means that
you are doing your
job. You are actively
protecting your
capital. Professional
traders actively take
small losses.
Amateurs resort to
hope and sometimes
prayer to save their
trade. In life, hope is
a powerful and
positive thing. In
trading, resorting to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3817                     
==================================================

hope is like placing
acid on your skin—
the longer you leave
it there, the worse the
situation will get.
16. Never let a day trade
turn into an overnight
trade. An overnight
trade should be
planned as an
overnight trade
before the trade is
ever entered.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3818                     
==================================================

17. Keep winners as long
as they are moving
your way. Let the
market take you out
at your target or with
a trailing stop. Don’t
use impulse exits.
Every exit is taken
for a specific reason
based on parameters
that have been clearly
defined.
18. Don’t overweight



==================================================
                    PAGE 3819                     
==================================================

your trades. The
more you overweight
a trade, the more
hope comes into play
when the trade goes
against you.
Remember, hope in
trading is like acid on
skin.
19. There is no logical
reason to hesitate in
taking a stop. Reentry
is only a commission



==================================================
                    PAGE 3820                     
==================================================

away.
20. Professional traders
take losses. Being
wrong and not taking
a loss damages your
own belief in yourself
and your abilities. If
you can’t trust
yourself to stick to
your stops, whom can
you trust?
21. Once you take a loss,
you naturally forget



==================================================
                    PAGE 3821                     
==================================================

about the trade and
move on. Do yourself
a favor and take
advantage of any
opportunity to clear
your head by taking a
small loss.
22. In general, you should
never let one position
go against you by
more than 2 percent
of your account
equity. Many setups



==================================================
                    PAGE 3822                     
==================================================

work out better if you
can use a larger stop.
Instead of trading 20
E-mini contracts with
a 1-point stop, trade
10 contracts with a 2-
point stop or 5
contracts with a 4-
point stop. The
monetary loss is
exactly the same, but
one set of these
parameters will work
better on a particular



==================================================
                    PAGE 3823                     
==================================================

setup than all the
others. Find out what
works best for your
setup and adjust your
parameters
accordingly.
23. Get a feel for market
direction by “drilling
down.” Look at the
monthly charts, then
the weekly, daily, 60-
minute, 15-minute,
and 5-minute charts



==================================================
                    PAGE 3824                     
==================================================

to get the best idea of
what the market is
going to do in the
short term. Always
start with the larger
time frames and drill
down to the smaller.
24. If you are hesitating to
get into a position
when you have a
clear signal, that
indicates that you
don’t trust yourself,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3825                     
==================================================

and that deep inside,
you feel that you may
let this trade get away
from you. Just get
into the position and
set your parameters.
Traders lose money
in positions every
day. Keep them
small. The
confidence you need
is not in whether or
not you are right; the
confidence you need



==================================================
                    PAGE 3826                     
==================================================

comes from knowing
that you execute your
setups the same way
each and every time
and do not deviate
from your plan. The
more you stick to
your parameters, the
more confidence you
will have as a trader.
25. Averaging down on a
position is like a
sinking ship



==================================================
                    PAGE 3827                     
==================================================

deliberately taking on
more water. This is
ridiculous and stupid.
Don’t be ridiculous
and stupid.
26. Try to enter in full
size right away. If
you pick up a half
position first, don’t
add to it and create a
full-sized position
unless the trade is
going your way.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3828                     
==================================================

27. Ring the register and
scale out of your
position. Have
modest, mechanical
targets for the first
half of your position.
Give the second half
more room to run.
28. Adrenaline is a sign
that your ego and
your emotions have
reached a point where
they are clouding



==================================================
                    PAGE 3829                     
==================================================

your judgment. If you
are not in a trade, do
not enter a new trade
when you are in this
state of mind. If you
are in a trade, stick to
your parameters and
walk away. If you are
in a losing trade that
has gone through
your stop, exit your
trade immediately
and walk away from
the markets.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3830                     
==================================================

29. You want to own the
stock before it breaks
out, then sell it to the
momentum players
after it breaks out. If
you buy breakouts,
realize that
professional traders
are handing off their
positions to you in
order to test the
strength of the trend.
They will typically
buy them back below



==================================================
                    PAGE 3831                     
==================================================

the breakout point—
which is typically
where you will set
your stop when you
buy a breakout. Use
this information to
make money off of
amateur traders who
buy breakouts.
30. Embracing your
opinion leads to
financial ruin. When
you find yourself



==================================================
                    PAGE 3832                     
==================================================

rationalizing or
justifying a decline
by saying things like,
“They are just
shaking out weak
hands here,” or, “The
market makers are
just dropping the bid
here,” then you are
embracing your
opinion. Don’t hang
on to a loser. You can
always get back in.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3833                     
==================================================

31. Unfortunately, you
will not learn
discipline until you
have wiped out a
trading account. Until
you have wiped out
an account, you
typically think that it
cannot happen to
you. It is precisely
that attitude that
makes you hold on to
losers and rationalize
them all the way into



==================================================
                    PAGE 3834                     
==================================================

the ground. If you
find yourself saying
things like, “My
stock in EXDS is still
a good investment,”
then it is time to
rethink your trading
career.
32. Siphon off your
trading profits each
month and stick them
into a money market
account. This action



==================================================
                    PAGE 3835                     
==================================================

helps you to focus
your attitude and
reminds you that this
is a business, not a
place to seek thrills.
If you want thrills, go
to Disneyland.
33. Professional traders
risk a small amount
of their equity on one
trade. Amateurs
typically risk a large
amount of equity on



==================================================
                    PAGE 3836                     
==================================================

one trade. This type
of situation creates
emotions that ruin
amateurs’ accounts.
34. Professional traders
focus on limiting
their risk and
protecting their
capital. Amateur
traders focus on how
much money they
can make on each
trade. Professionals



==================================================
                    PAGE 3837                     
==================================================

always take money
away from amateurs.
35. In the financial
markets, heroes get
crushed. Averaging
down on a losing
position is a “heroic
move” that is akin to
Superman taking a
spoonful of
Kryptonite to prove
his manhood. The
stock market is not



==================================================
                    PAGE 3838                     
==================================================

about blind courage.
Nobody hands out
any awards to traders
who picked the dead
high or the dead low.
Wait for a setup. This
is about finesse.
Don’t be a hero.
36. Traders never believe
that they will blow
out their account.
Always realize that
you will become a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3839                     
==================================================

candidate for this if
you don’t stick to
your trading rules.
37. The market reinforces
bad habits. If early on
you held on to a loser
that went against you
by 20 percent, but
you were able to get
out at breakeven, you
are doomed. The
market has reinforced
a bad habit. The next



==================================================
                    PAGE 3840                     
==================================================

time you let a stock
go against you by 20
percent, you will
hang on because you
have been taught that
you can get out at
breakeven if you are
patient and hang on
long enough.
38. The true mark of an
amateur trader who is
never going to make
it in this business is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3841                     
==================================================

continually blaming
everything but
himself for the
outcome of a bad
trade. This includes,
but is not limited to,
saying things like:
• The analysts are
crooks.
• The market makers
were fishing for
stops.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3842                     
==================================================

• I was on the phone,
and it collapsed on
me.
• My neighbor gave
me a bad tip.
• The message boards
caused this one to
pump and dump.
• The specialists are
playing games.
The mark of a
professional,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3843                     
==================================================

however, sounds
like this:
• It is my fault. I
traded this position
too large for my
account size.
• It is my fault. I
didn’t stick to my
own risk
parameters.
• It is my fault. I
allowed my



==================================================
                    PAGE 3844                     
==================================================

emotions to dictate
my trades.
• It is my fault. I was
not disciplined in
my trades.
• It is my fault. I
knew there was a
risk in holding this
trade into earnings,
but I didn’t fully
comprehend it
when I took the
trade.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3845                     
==================================================

The obvious
difference here is
accountability. For
amateurs, everything
having to do with the
market is “outside
their control.” That
is not reasonable
thinking and really
just points to
individuals who
have, probably for



==================================================
                    PAGE 3846                     
==================================================

the first time, had to
confront their “real
self” as opposed to
the perfect self or
idealized self that
they have
constructed in their
mind. This is also
known as “living in a
fog.” People can
drift through life in
their own private
world, where they
are pretty special and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3847                     
==================================================

can do no wrong.
Unfortunately,
trading rips off this
mask, because you
cannot dispute what
has happened to your
account. This is also
known as
“confronting
reality.” For many
people, when they
start trading, they are
suddenly confronting
reality for the first



==================================================
                    PAGE 3848                     
==================================================

time in their lives.
Just to see the world
as it really is requires
a lifetime of training,
and for many people,
trading the stock
market is their first
real step on this
journey. Some
people say that
traders are born, not
made. Not so. If you
choose to see the
world as it is, then



==================================================
                    PAGE 3849                     
==================================================

you can start trading
successfully
tomorrow.
39. Amateur traders
always think, “How
much money can I
make on this trade?”
Professional traders
always think, “How
much money can I
lose on this trade?”
Traders who control
their risk take money



==================================================
                    PAGE 3850                     
==================================================

from the traders who
are thinking about the
red BMW they are
going to buy.
40. At some point traders
realize that no one
can tell them exactly
what is going to
happen next in the
market, and that they
can never know how
much they are going
to make on a trade.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3851                     
==================================================

Thus the only thing
left to do is to
determine how much
risk they are willing
to take in order to
find out if they are
right or not. The key
to trading success is
to focus on how
much money is at
risk, not on how
much you can make.
The longer I do this, the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3852                     
==================================================

more protective I get of my
trading capital, and the more
surprised I am when things
actually work out exactly as
planned. And that is what
keeps it so interesting each
and every day.
Surviving the Trader’s
Journey
Strategies fail because
traders have to have only a
couple of losing trades in a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3853                     
==================================================

row before they throw out
the whole system and go
back to relying on their gut.
Once traders are in this
situation, they head into a
downward spiral very
quickly. Human emotions get
people in at the dead highs,
and then human emotions get
people out at the dead lows,
as they continually buy at the
top out of greed and then sell
the lows out of fear. Or, in
the case of shorts, they sell at



==================================================
                    PAGE 3854                     
==================================================

the lows out of greed and
cover at the highs because of
fear. And this is a cycle that
happens over and over and
over again. And it’s never
going to stop.
The financial markets
naturally take advantage of
and prey upon human nature,
especially when it comes to
greed, hope, and fear. The
key is to remember that the
biggest movements in the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3855                     
==================================================

markets do not occur when
traders in general “feel like
buying.” They occur because
groups of traders are all
getting skewered at the same
time and are being forced out
of a position. In reality,
traders are not trading stocks,
futures, or options. They are
trading other traders. The
profitable traders learn to be
aware of the psychology and
emotions behind the person
who is taking the opposite



==================================================
                    PAGE 3856                     
==================================================

side of their trade. Average
traders understand only their
side of the trade. Superior
traders understand what’s
happening on both sides of a
trade and know how to take
advantage of situations that
will hurt most traders. They
know how to take advantage
of human weakness, and,
therefore, they are able to
grind most traders into the
ground like so much raw
meat. In essence, winning



==================================================
                    PAGE 3857                     
==================================================

traders steal money from
losing traders.
My partners and I
jokingly refer to the financial
markets as the “Goddess of
Temptation.” The goal, of
course, is for traders to
develop a professional
trading mindset that prevents
them from succumbing to
these temptations. Instead of
being the cause of the ebbs
and flows of the markets,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3858                     
==================================================

traders need to jump the
chasm that allows them to
ride out these ebbs and flows
on a course toward
profitability.
Good skiers rarely worry
about a route. They just go,
confident that they’ll react to
changes in the trail as they
come upon them. It’s the
same thing in trading: traders
have to have confidence in
their technique. That is the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3859                     
==================================================

beauty of mustering the right
mindset before a trader starts
the day—it enables the trader
to feel like a good skier, nice
and relaxed for the next
unexpected turn.
Before He Trades
In some marriages, a wife
might get upset when her
husband stumbles home
drunk at 4 in the morning
after going to a rock concert



==================================================
                    PAGE 3860                     
==================================================

with another woman. My
marriage would qualify as
falling into that category.
Although this mishap can
partly be blamed on the false
sense of energy and
confidence one gets from
combining too much Tito’s
Vodka with Red Bull, I did
have what I thought was a
valid trading-related excuse
for this behavior. The
excuse: “I want to help other
traders.” I’ll discuss this



==================================================
                    PAGE 3861                     
==================================================

knowingly dubious statement
in more detail shortly. More
pressing is the question,
“Why in the world am I
sharing this story?” After all,
there is a reason it’s called a
personal life—it’s personal.
Traders live hectic lives,
with outside influences
jerking their senses around
on a daily basis. These
external forces can drive
traders to distraction, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3862                     
==================================================

once that happens, the traders
start adding to losing
positions and start pulling
stops. This takes a trader
down the dark path where
she sets herself up for a
catastrophic loss. There are
few guarantees in life, but I
guarantee this: if traders
allow outside circumstances
to influence their level of
discipline, they will get
whacked with a catastrophic
loss. Maybe not today and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3863                     
==================================================

maybe not next week, but it
only has to happen once. And
it will occur much more
quickly with leveraged
instruments such as futures
and options, where gun-
slinging traders can rack up a
monster loss in the time it
takes them to return from the
bathroom. Once this disaster
hits a trader’s account, a new
reality emerges that is even
more horrible to imagine—
having to go out and get a

                    PAGE 3864                     
==================================================

job.
Block Out Distractions
To succeed as a trader, the
daily distractions have to be
managed. Life marches on,
despite a trader’s need for
quiet and solitude. To be able
to make a consistent living at
this incredible occupation, a
trader must maintain
discipline no matter what is
going on around him. And



==================================================
                    PAGE 3865                     
==================================================

that’s why I’m sharing this
story.
Today is the first trading
day after my 4-in-the-
morning escapade. I did have
the weekend to recover, so
I’m feeling semi-human
again. On this day, with
figurative plates being
thrown against the wall, I
still have to focus on my
setups. I have been doing this
long enough to know that a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3866                     
==================================================

catastrophic loss can happen
to anyone. The market could
not care less that I wrote a
book on trading—it’s
certainly not going to show
me any courtesy (or mercy,
for that matter). Since I truly
do not want to go out and get
a real job, I take a deep
breath and start the “hurry-
up-and-wait” process that I
have done thousands of times
before, where I kill time
waiting for a specific setup to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3867                     
==================================================

take shape. This is despite
my strong inclination this
morning to just throw on a
trade to give my mind
something else to occupy
itself with.
While I’m lingering, I do
have a few song lyrics to
rewrite, so I work on that
while waiting for one of my
alerts to fire off. Yes, I did
say song lyrics, and that’s
part of the reason I was out



==================================================
                    PAGE 3868                     
==================================================

so late.
Trading the Squeeze
The S&P futures were down
more than 20 points
yesterday, and this morning
they are trading in a volatile,
yet narrow range. On the
377-tick chart I’m watching
(see Figure 26.1), I see that a
squeeze sets up at point 1,
but the C wave at this point
was wishy-washy, with part



==================================================
                    PAGE 3869                     
==================================================

of it still below zero. I pass
on the trade, though I really
want to pull the trigger. Half
an hour later, another
squeeze sets up at point 2.
This time the C wave is
clearly above zero, and I take
a long trade. I get in at
1193.50. For this small a
time frame, I’m willing to
risk no more than 10 ticks, so
I set my stop at 1191.00.
Once I’m up 8 ticks (at point
4), I sell half my position,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3870                     
==================================================

and move my stop to my
entry level at 1193.50. Now
I’ll just wait for the TTM
trend to turn black two bars
in a row, or I’ll get stopped
out. The ES pushes as high
as 1198.50. By the time the
bars turn black at point 5 and
I’m able to sell, I’m out at
1196.50.

                    PAGE 3871

Figure 26.1
The Subtleties
Trading truly is an art form,
with the canvas being not the
screen but the profit and loss
(P&L). The art of trading
comes into play once a
predefined setup has
occurred. At this point, it is
time to finesse an entry. And
once that entry is finessed, it
is then time to manage the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3873                     
==================================================

position in such a way as to
continually reduce one’s risk
while allowing the trade, if it
so desires, to stretch its legs
and run. Surprisingly, trailing
stops on a full position are
some of the worst ways to do
this. With this style, traders
set themselves up for getting
stopped out of the entire
position on a wiggle, while
the market then resumes its
original move.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3874                     
==================================================

For a finessed entry, my
main goal is to avoid going
into a position using a market
order. That opens the door to
too many bad habits; I prefer
to keep that door closed. In
looking at Figure 26.1, I see
that the ES pulled back into
moving average support at
point 3, just as the squeeze
had started to form. I placed
a bid at 1191.50 to try to pick
up any additional slight
weakness. I couldn’t get



==================================================
                    PAGE 3875                     
==================================================

filled. Once the TTM trend
turned back to gray and
popped back up above its
moving averages (also at
point 3), I got more
aggressive and moved my
bid to 1193.50. This time the
market eased back and I got
filled, and a few moments
later the squeeze fired off
long and we were off and
running.
This is where the rubber



==================================================
                    PAGE 3876                     
==================================================

meets the road—any trader
can get into a position, and
frankly entries are a dime a
dozen. It’s the exits that
make or break a trader, and
this is where one has to stay
focused and not do anything
stupid. I’m not going to add
to this position and load the
boat because the market
looks like it is going to take
off. Part of me is thinking,
“Maybe I should make a big
trade, generate some quick



==================================================
                    PAGE 3877                     
==================================================

cash, and buy something for
my wife to make her happy.”
That thought passes quickly
—I am lucky enough to have
already experienced how
brainless a trading idea that
would be.
Keep Those Stops in Place
I’m also not going to hold on
to this position without a stop
in place. That’s the tough
part about outside



==================================================
                    PAGE 3878                     
==================================================

distractions—in a normal
situation, professional traders
don’t worry about getting
stopped out of a trade. Small
losses are simply a part of the
trading lifestyle. However, if
there are crazy events
swirling around a trader’s
life, getting stopped out can
be frustrating and can
instigate foolish behavior—
such as removing the stop so
as not to have to deal with
the annoyance of getting



==================================================
                    PAGE 3879                     
==================================================

stopped out. All traders have
done it, and its makes as
much sense as not going to
the hospital after getting a
gunshot wound to the
abdomen so as not to
increase one’s insurance
premiums.
In this case, I start with an
initial stop at 2.5 ES points
(10 ticks). If and when the
trade goes my way, I like to
start reducing risk as soon as



==================================================
                    PAGE 3880                     
==================================================

possible. Once I’m up 2 full
ES points (8 ticks), I cover
one-half of my position and
move my stop from 2.5
points to breakeven. My next
target is essentially “open,”
and I’m willing to hang on as
long as the TTM trend stays
in my direction. This could
mean that it runs out of gas
quickly and I get stopped out
at my new breakeven stop, or
it could mean that economic
data are released, the market



==================================================
                    PAGE 3881                     
==================================================

rallies 15 handles, and I catch
every point. You just never
know what is going to
happen next.
Once I see the two black
bars, it’s the signal for me to
close out the rest of the
position. I do this and net
3.00 points on the last half of
the trade.
The whole idea of this exit
strategy is to reduce risk on
the trade to the point where a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3882                     
==================================================

trader has a breakeven stop,
and then to be patient and sit
on one’s hands for a potential
runner. When I’m sitting on
my last half, I do not trail my
stop—I just wait for an exit
signal. I’m either going to get
stopped at breakeven on my
last half or get a runner. For
the ES, typical runners are 2
to 5 points, with an
occasional 10-point (or
more) run thrown into the
mix. In other markets, such



==================================================
                    PAGE 3883                     
==================================================

as soybeans, oil, and gold,
typical runners can be much
more sustained. Soybeans
can easily run 15 to 20 cents,
which P&L-wise is identical
to 15 to 20 ES points or $750
to $1,000 per contract.
The Other Woman
We are now at a logical place
to revisit my 4-in-the-
morning juvenile adventure,
and how that event unfolded.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3884                     
==================================================

To make a long story short, I
had been trying to think of an
entertaining way to remind
traders of the critical
importance of following their
trading plans. It is just so
crucial to follow the basic
rules of trading each and
every day and on each and
every trade. Deviation is not
an option—not even for one
trade. And for some reason I
thought, “Why not a music
video?”



==================================================
                    PAGE 3885                     
==================================================

Carrie Underwood’s song
“Before He Cheats” kept
playing in my mind. It’s a
song about a guy who is
cheating on his girlfriend.
The girlfriend finds out and
proceeds to destroy his car
with a baseball bat. I thought,
“Why not rewrite the song?
Have a girl who gave her
man all her money to trade.
He, of course, doesn’t follow
the trading rules and loses all
her money. She finds out and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3886                     
==================================================

proceeds to destroy his
computers and monitors with
a baseball bat. And I could
call it ‘Before He Trades.’”
(In case you are wondering,
it’s considered a parody and
is 100 percent legal.)
Of course, if one writes a
song, one has to have a
singer. I found one—a gospel
singer. We agreed to meet up
at a My Chemical Romance
concert at Stubb’s Barbecue



==================================================
                    PAGE 3887                     
==================================================

in Austin, Texas. I had to
hear her sing, and I needed to
see if she would be right for
the video. (For the record, I
did invite my wife along, but
at the last minute she
declined because she had a
cold.)
If you have never seen My
Chemical Romance live, it is
a great band with a ton of
energy and presence. Many
Tito’s with Red Bull later,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3888                     
==================================================

we followed the crowd out to
Sixth Street, drifted into a
bar, and before I knew it, the
hours flew by, and— bam!—
I got home late. I was in B-I-
G trouble. (Any readers who
have been to Sixth Street in
Austin might understand how
that could happen.)
In the end, my wife saw
that I really did just want to
shoot a music video—I
wasn’t going through a



==================================================
                    PAGE 3889                     
==================================================

midlife crisis or anything.
She got enthusiastic about
the project and even helped
me rewrite some of the
lyrics. We interviewed a
couple of production
companies and felt that Ray
Schlogel at Underground
Planet would be a good fit.
The singer, Gloria Cadena,
recorded the song. I played
the trader in the video, of
course. Schlogel shot and
edited the footage, and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3890                     
==================================================

presto, I had a music video.
You Just Never Know …
The longer I trade, the more I
have come to understand that
no matter what a trader does
—no matter how many
indicators or time frames she
meticulously studies— a
trader can never, never, never
predict with 100 percent
certainty what the market is
going to do next. As



==================================================
                    PAGE 3891                     
==================================================

someone who trades during
the day and who is also
involved in running other
trading-related businesses, I
realize that this is a statement
some people would call
blasphemous. Surely,
through all my years of
trading, I have found a way
to wait patiently for the
perfect setup that works
nearly all the time. But really
one never knows what’s
going to happen—that’s the



==================================================
                    PAGE 3892                     
==================================================

plain and simple truth.
Once I realized that, a
funny thing happened to me
during the trading day. I
stopped getting stressed out.
Instead of being tired and
exhausted at the end of the
day, I was relaxed enough to
enjoy time with my kids and
generally hang out. This is in
contrast to the stressed-out
days when I would
painstakingly watch every



==================================================
                    PAGE 3893                     
==================================================

tick, willing the market to go
my way. Afterwards, I was
so tired that I had to grab a
few beers and look for
escape in movies and one-
person shooter games to
unwind.
The market is going to do
what it damn well pleases,
regardless of any hopes and
dreams the trader has pinned
to a particular trade, and
completely regardless of how



==================================================
                    PAGE 3894                     
==================================================

much confirmation a trader
has on a particular trade that
may normally have a high
probability of working out.
The only thing a trader
can do is control his risk—on
each and every trade. Stay
disciplined. Be patient.
Remind yourself of this
before every trade. If there is
a secret to trading, it is this:
take the next trade not to
make money, but to improve



==================================================
                    PAGE 3895                     
==================================================

one’s skills as a trader. This
is how a trader is able to
make a living at the game.
This is how a trader is able to
avoid a catastrophic loss.
And did I learn any
additional lessons about the
trading lifestyle while
shooting the video? Yes—the
next time I’m out until 4 a.m.

taking my wife along. To see

The Easier Path: Swing
Trading
One thing that I have learned
during years of trading is that
it is often easier to make
money swing and position
trading. Day trading still has
its place—but overtrading is
a guaranteed path to losing
money, as is overreacting



==================================================
                    PAGE 3897                     
==================================================

and over-staring-at-the-
charts. For me, day trading is
about being patient for a few
select setups each day, with
the aim of creating monthly
cash flow to pay the bills.
Swing and position trading,
on the other hand, are about
creating wealth.
I will swing and position
trade just about anything, and
I trade the same patterns
whether what I’m trading is



==================================================
                    PAGE 3898                     
==================================================

soybeans, oil, or an
individual stock. In this case,
PotashCorp (POT) (see
Figure 26.2) caught my eye
back in April 2008 as it set
up a textbook swing trade. At
point 1, POT reaches a new
52-week high, which is one
of my favorite things to see
in a stock, because at some
point it will try to make
another 52-week high …
until it doesn’t. On June 3,
2008, a squeeze setup



==================================================
                    PAGE 3899                     
==================================================

indicates a contraction in
volatility at point 2. I check
the C wave, and it’s well
above zero. It’s just a matter
of waiting for the toothpaste
to shoot out of the tube and
being there to catch it before
it hits the floor.
Potash stock is
consolidating directly under
new all-time high levels.
This is important because it
indicates a persistent type of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3900                     
==================================================

momentum. The goal of the
trade is to wait for a signal
that shows it’s ready to break
out, jump in, and then scale
out using Fibonacci
extension targets. My
favorites for this are the
1.272 percent and 1.618
percent extensions, which are
shown at point 4 and point 5.
To get these in most
platforms, you have to edit
the parameters and add these
in as new default levels on



==================================================
                    PAGE 3901                     
==================================================

top of the regular 0.382,
0.50, and 0.618 retracement
levels.
Okay, let’s look at the
current signal setting up at
point 2. Unlike day trading,
which requires a precise and
patient entry methodology
because of the small stops
used, with swing trades, the
signal firing off means that it
is time to take a position
immediately. I still use limit



==================================================
                    PAGE 3902                     
==================================================

orders, but I don’t try to get
too cute. I don’t want to miss
the trade—I don’t want to
“be a dick for a tick,” where I
get a great signal but miss a
huge move because I was
trying to save a few pennies
on the purchase price.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3903

==================================================

Figure 26.2
The squeeze on POT fires
off, with a gray dot appearing
after a series of black ones. I
use a simple five-minute
chart and place limit orders
at intraday support levels, my
goal being to get a full
position that day. My trading
instrument of choice is to
buy in-the-money calls (delta
0.70) that have at least two
weeks of life before



==================================================
                    PAGE 3905                     
==================================================

expiration. The nice thing
about options is if you are
ever in doubt, just go out to
the next month to buy more
time. It’s like an insurance
policy.
In this case, POT was
actually trading at $210 when
I took this play. Since that
time, the stock has split 3 for
1 in February 2011, so this
chart shows the lower “split”
price closer to the $70 level.



==================================================
                    PAGE 3906                     
==================================================

Of course, the signals are still
the same. I bought the June
and July 190 and 195 calls,
which would be the
equivalent of buying the June
and July 65 calls post-stock
split. I split my order in half
across June and July to give
myself extra time on a runner
should the occasion arise.
Many traders like the idea
of buying 100 out-of-the-
money options at $1



==================================================
                    PAGE 3907                     
==================================================

($10,000 total investment),
thinking that if the stock
were to really take off, they
would make a fortune. I
would rather take that
$10,000 and buy 10 in-the-
money calls at $10 apiece.
This way, when the stock
moves even a little, I’m
making money. There is
nothing worse than being
dead right on a stock but
losing money because one
bought the wrong options



==================================================
                    PAGE 3908                     
==================================================

contract. That’s why it’s
called trading, not praying.
The targets on this trade
are $227 and $242 ($75.66
and $80.66 post-split). Once
a stock exceeds a prior 52-
week high, it has an 85
percent probability of testing
its 1.272 Fibonacci
extension. When this level is

up to breakeven. There is
then about a 65 percent

chance that the stock will
then hit its 1.618 Fibonacci
extension. At this point, one
of three things is going to
happen. First, my new stop
will get hit. Second, my
1.618 Fibonacci target will
get hit. Third, the TTM trend
will change colors, and I will
use that signal to exit. In this
case, we hit the 1.618 level at
point 5. We were able to get
a nice high from POT. (I’m
glad the stock symbol wasn’t

Conclusion and Final
Thoughts
Finishing a book must be
similar to sending a child off
to college, except that in this
case, I’m not sad to see it go.
It’s a great process, and it
even helped me to clarify
some of my own trading
ideas … but it’s a lot of hard
work. If it helps you to

become a better trader, then
the time was well spent. This
book really discusses
everything I know about
trading up to this point in
time. If you are interested in
additional resources outside

We use this site to post our

For anyone interested in

When I kicked this off
about 400 pages ago, I
mentioned that intermediate
traders generally fall into the
following three categories:
• Those who know the
setup like the back of
their hand, but fail to
make money because of



==================================================
                    PAGE 3915                     
==================================================

a flawed trading
methodology
• Those who know the
setup better than their
spouse’s bad habits, but
fail to make money
because the setup is
being used in the wrong
market
• Those who know the
setup better than the
varied plot lines on
Alias, but fail to make



==================================================
                    PAGE 3916                     
==================================================

money because they
can’t stick to their rules.
The point of this, of
course, is to emphasize the
importance of establishing a
trade setup from a
multifaceted approach.
Successful trading is a lot
more than just, “What’s my
entry, and what’s my stop?”
In addition to the actual
setup, there also needs to be
a foundation from which to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3917                     
==================================================

operate the setup. This
foundation consists of the
following: the right setup, in
the right market, in the right
time frame, all of which tie
into the trader’s personality
—and all this ultimately ties
into how the trade is
managed. How will you
know when this all comes
together for you? The first
clue is that it will have
nothing to do with how you
feel about it. It will have



==================================================
                    PAGE 3918                     
==================================================

everything to do with the
results. I’ve shared with you
some of the setups that work
for me. Find two setups out
of this book that you can
follow in a particular market
in a particular time frame,
stick to your rules, and make
them your own. Once you
have two setups that work for
you consistently, start
looking at adding a third.
There is no reason to rush
into this. Take your time and



==================================================
                    PAGE 3919                     
==================================================

master each step as you go.
And remember, making a
living on one simple setup,
on one market, on one time
frame is just fine too.
As I state in the
Introduction, without rules, a
trader is like a wounded
antelope in the center of a
pride of lions. It is not a
question of “if” the antelope
is going to get whacked
faster than a newly

==================================================

discovered FBI informant
within the Mafia, but rather
of “when.” For traders
without the discipline to
follow their rules, the
possibility of financial ruin is
not a question of “if.” It’s
only a matter of “when.”
I work with traders all the
time. The ones who turn the
corner and eventually start
making a living at this
profession learn to stick to



==================================================
                    PAGE 3921                     
==================================================

their rules. This is typically a
painful process. There is only
one guarantee I can give you
in this business, and it is this:
if you can’t stick to the rules
you develop, and if you are
always finding some excuse
to enter or exit a trade
earlier or later than your
rules state, you will never,
never make it as a trader.
As a history major, I have
to say that this is the most



==================================================

==================================================

exciting time to be alive in
the history of the world.
Change used to occur over
the course of centuries, and
then decades, then years, and
now change is taking place
every day. One of my
favorite fiction books of all
time is James Clavell’s
Taipan. This book is based
on historical facts and tells
the tale of rival China traders
Dirk Straun and Tyler Brock
in the newly formed British

colony of Hong Kong in the
1840s. They had to make
their buying and selling
decisions for vast quantities
of spices, cotton, and tea
using price quotes from
London that had been printed
three months before. Can you
imagine trading with quotes
delayed three months? That
is what people had to do less
than 150 years ago. Today,
when I’m in Hong Kong on
business, I can type in real

time and get responses in real
time from a counterpart in
London through instant
messaging. Don’t get caught
up in any “wishing for the
good old days” or any of that
nonsense. As I’m writing this
on October 18, 2011, the
world is undergoing a lot of
economic uncertainty, and
things are going to get worse
before they get better. But
they will get better. Change
is life; life is change. For



==================================================
                    PAGE 3925                     
==================================================

traders, whether the markets
go up, down, or sideways,
whether the economy is
growing or we are in the
midst of a great depression,
there will always be
opportunities to trade.
It is my hope that, after
reading this book, you will
have a better foundation for a
plan to trade the markets
successfully on a full-time
basis: proven setups to play,



==================================================
                    PAGE 3926                     
==================================================

markets that best fit those
particular setups, and a set of
rules to apply to those setups.
That is pretty much all a
trader needs in order to
survive and thrive in this
greatest of professions.
