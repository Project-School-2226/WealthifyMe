FOREWORD
The title of Chapter 1 of this book is: “The Legend of the Holy
Grail.” “The Holy Grail” is a phrase you often hear in some trading
and investment circles. Most people believe that it refers to some
mysterious trading system out there that is going to make them
millions with little or no risk. It’s not that at all.
But before I tell you about the Holy Grail, let me tell you a lit-
tle about who I am and why Dr. Tharp asked me to write the
Foreword to his book. I started managing other peoples’ money in
1992 and in just 5 years those assets have grown from about $3 mil-
lion to about $50 million. That has happened partially because my
hedge fund has compounded by better than 40 percent per year, net
to investors, over the last 5 years. We were up 61 percent net to
investors in 1996 and 53 percent net to investors in 1997. Since I met
Dr. Tharp, my net worth has grown many times over, and I do
believe that it comes from adopting many of the Holy Grail secrets
contained in this book. I think that Dr. Tharp understands and
teaches those secrets better than anyone else I have ever met. Those
trading secrets are also shared on Social Networks. Let me tell you why:
When I was a young boy, I remember dreaming that I would
become a millionaire by the time I reached 25 years of age. I reached
that goal through real estate development in 1981, but only briefly
and then it all came tumbling down around me. I was devastated,
but I picked myself up and started again. My next attempt at real
success was in the investment field.
Yet I almost had a similar type of crash in my fortunes. I
remember the day clearly. I was sitting in my office in Naples,
Florida, in late 1992. It was a typical south Florida autumn day. I
was watching the palm trees sway in the breeze outside my win-
dow, wondering why my trading had become more difficult since
I began managing money for others. I wasn’t about to crash at the

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This book is a product of 15 years of thinking about markets, study-
ing hundreds of great traders and investors, and coaching many
more to greatness by helping them apply some of the principles
you’ll find in this book. If this book helps hundreds more, even if I
never meet you, it will have been worth the effort.
During those 15 years, numerous people have helped shape
the thinking that has gone into this book. I can only acknowledge a
few of those people by name. However, everyone who contributed
in any way has my deepest thanks and appreciation.
I’d like to acknowledge Ed Seykota for showing me very early
on the importance of simplicity and creative money management.
Ed has presented at three of my early seminars, and I’m deeply
indebted to his wisdom.
Tom Basso has been a great contributor to my thinking and my
life. Tom was a guest speaker at more than a dozen of my seminars
and several of our professional trader schools. Tom has also con-
tributed several sections to this book. Thank you, Tom.
Ray Kelly was one of my earliest clients. I’ve watched him
evolve from a tough floor trader-whose favorite saying used to be
“My way or the highway!“-into someone who would freely give
his time to inner-city high school kids just to convince them to start
to take responsibility for their lives. Ray is one of the best traders I
know and a great teacher as well. He’s presented at many of my
seminars and has written the arbitrage section of this book.
Chuck LeBeau helped me make the link from the famous
trader’s axiom-“Cut your losses short and let your profits run”-
to the importance of exits. Think about it. Cutting losses short is all
about aborting losses--exits. Letting profits run is all about exits
as well. The entire axiom is all about exits. Chuck’s persistence in
driving home this point has been very valuable to me. Chuck is

A number of my clients have asked me not to include certain sec-
tions in this book, with the admonishment of “You’re giving away
too much.” Yet my job is to coach traders and investors to achieve
peak performance. Every available tool is important in attempting
to do that, because so much misinformation is available in the lit-
erature that the average person will constantly be led astray
Most of the misinformation is not deliberate. People want to
be led astray. They constantly ask the wrong questions, and those
selling information get rewarded by giving them the answers they
want. For example:
. What’s the market going to do now?
. What should I buy now?
. I own XYZ stock. Do you think it’s going to go up? (If you
say no, then they’ll ask someone else until they find a
person who agrees with their opinion.)
. Tell me how I can get into the market and be “right” most
of the time.
In April 1997, I did a Z-day seminar in Germany. Toward the end of
the seminar, I gave the participants the choice of doing an exercise
dealing with self-sabotage (which all of them needed) or asking me
questions. They took a vote on what to do. Guess what the first
question asked of me was? “Dr. Tharp, what’s your opinion about
what the U.S. stock market will do for the rest of 1997?” This was
despite my best efforts over the past two days to explain to them
why such questions were unimportant.
When people move beyond questions of “what” to buy into
questions about “how,” they still ask the wrong questions. Now the
question becomes something like:
What criteria should I use to enter the market in order to be right
most of the time?

The objectives of this book are twofold:
1. To help you in your search for the secrets of the “Holy
Grail”
And at the same time,
2. To help you in your search for a winning trading system
that’s right for you
There is a critical assumption in both of those objectives: that you
are the most important factor in your performance. Jack Schwager,
after writing two books in which he interviewed some of the
world’s top traders, concluded that the most important factor in
their success was that they each had a trading system that was right
for them. I’d like to take that assumption one step further: You can-
not design a system that is right for you unless you know some-
thing about yourself.
As a result, the first part of this book is about self-discovery
and moving yourself to a point where it’s possible for you to do
market research. I’ve included a chapter on the psychological
essence of successful trading, what the Holy Grail is really all
about; a chapter on judgmental heuristics; and a chapter on setting
Your personal objectives.

CHAPTER 1
The Legend of the Holy Grail
We have only to follow the thread of the hero’s path, and
where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall
find a god. And where we had thought to slay another, we
shall slay ourselves. Where we had thought to travel out-
ward, we will come to the center of our own existence.
And where we had thought to be done, we will one be
with all the world.
Let me tell you a secret about the market. You can make big
money by buying breakouts that go beyond a normal day’s
range of price movement. These are called “volatility break-
outs.” One trader is famous for making millions with
volatility breakouts. You can do it, too! You can make a bun-
dle! Here’s how you do it.
First, you take yesterday’s price range. If there’s a gap
between yesterday and the day before, then add the gap
into the range-that’s called the “true range.” Now, take 40
percent of yesterday’s true range and bracket today’s price
by that amount. The upper value is your buy signal and the
lower value is your sell signal (i.e., for selling short). If
either value is hit, get into the market and you’ll have an 80
percent chance of making money tomorrow. And over the

Perhaps you have had the experience of attending a workshop con-
ducted by an investment expert who explains his success secrets.
For example, I just told you about a class that one of the world’s
greatest traders taught on trading in the early 1970s. He spent 2
weeks teaching them a method that would have made them very
rich (at the time) and then required 8 more weeks to get them to the
point where they were willing to apply it.

We typically trade our beliefs about the market and once we’ve
made up our minds about those beliefs, we’re not likely to change
them. And when we play the markets, we assume that we are con-
sidering all of the available information. Instead, our beliefs,
through selective perception, may have eliminated the most useful
information.
You now understand that the search for the Holy Grail system is an
internal search. This chapter will help you in that search by learn-
ing about what might be holding you back. It is your first step:
becoming aware of what holds you back. When you have such
awareness, you also have the ability to change.
Overall, a basic source of problems for all of us is coping with
the vast amount of information we must process regularly. French
Economist George Anderla has measured changes in the rate of
information flow with which we human beings must cope. He con-
cluded that information flow doubled in the 1,500 years between
the time of Jesus and Leonardo DaVinci. It doubled again by the

ing. First, we’ll cover biases that distort the process of system
development. Most of the biases covered fall into this category.
However, some of them affect other aspects of trading as well.
For example, the gambler’s fallacy affects trading system devel-
opment because people want systems that don’t have long losing
streaks, but it also affects how the system is traded once it is
developed.
Next, we’ll cover biases that affect how you test trading sys-
tems. For example, one gentleman, when exposed to some of this
information, claimed that it is full of controversy and that key ele-
ments were left out. Those statements, however, were just projec-
tions coming from him. There is no conflict within the material pre-
sented in this book-it’s just information. Thus, if you perceive
such controversy, it is because that controversy is commg from you.

Scientific research knows about this kind of bias. Even the
most careful researcher will tend to bias the result toward his or her
hypothesis. That’s why scientists have double-blind tests-tests in
which the experimenter does not know which group is the experi-

Conservatism Bias
Once we have a trading concept in mind, the conservatism bias
takes over: We fail to recognize, or even see, contradictory evidence.
The human mind is quick to see the few outstanding examples of
moves that work while avoiding or ignoring examples that don’t
work. For example, if you looked at a lot of data, you might find that
the pattern in Figure 2-2 was followed by a large move 20 percent
of the time. The rest of the time nothing significant happened.
Most people totally ignore the contradictory evidence, despite
the fact that it is overwhelming. However, after seven or eight
losses in a row, they suddenly begin to be concerned about the
validity of their trading system without ever determining how

your emotional response to the questions. The emotions you feel
when answering the questions will be a big clue for you.
If you don’t want to answer the questions and put off doing
so, then you have some psychological issues. If you get angry or
disturbed at some questions, then you probably have some psy-
chological issues. However, keep working at these questions until
you are finished and have answers you can live with. Part of the
reason for doing the questions is to find out about the most impor-
tant part of your trading-you.
You might also ask if the questions are telling you that you
should not trade. If you have not completed the questionnaire, or
have not completed it to your satisfaction, then you are not ready
to trade. I would not recommend that you do so until you thor-
oughly understand each question and your own response to it. Of
course, once you’ve done that, you must still develop a trading sys-

Steps to Developing a System
There must be a map or model of the data which shows the zone to
be navigated and upon which is marked the best route.
Daoid Fosler, Ph.D.
It’s very useful to believe that if several people can do something
well, then the same skill can be copied, or modeled, and taught to
someone else. This is what NemoLinguistic Programming, or the
science of modeling, is all about. To develop a good model, you
need to find several people who can do the task well. You then need
to interview those people to find out what they do in common.
These are the key tasks involved in the model.’ It’s very important
to find out what they do in common. If you don’t, you’ll simply dis-
cover the idiosyncracies of the people involved, which usually are
not that important.
I’ve worked with hundreds of outstanding traders and
investors in a coaching role over the past 12 years. During that
time, I’ve had the opportunity to learn how to do trading research
,from these experts. The steps are quite clear and easy to do. This

ing for as much opportunity as possible to trade (within a limited
time frame) to realize that expectancy.
In my opinion, as discussed later in this book, expectancy is
controlled by your exits. Thus, the best systems have three or four
different exits. You’ll need to test the exits you select one at a time.

My estimate is that fewer than 20 percent of the people trading the
markets have a system to guide their trading or investing. Of those
that do, most are just using predefined indicators. Very few people
understand the concept behind their system. As a result, I asked a
number of experts to write about the concepts that they trade. This
is not an exhaustive discussion of the various concepts you might
trade. It is just a sampling. Your goal in reading this chapter should
be to think about each concept and determine if any of them fits
your personality. The concept that “fits” will be the one you have
the most success trading. But you must understand your concept
thoroughly before you develop a system using it.
While I was first writing this book, I received a phone call
from an expert on chaos theory. He said that he had been following
my work for many years. He believed that I had a lot of integrity,
but that I was very wrong about systems. He said that it was ridicu-
,IOUS to assume that any sort of system was possible-instead, it
was all about luck and individual psychology. I said that I agreed
with him if he were defining a system as just an entry technique.
Instead, I said, one had to develop a methodology with a positive

conflicting, forces before they are fully realized. A seasonal decline

PART 2 Conceptualization of ‘four System
Fact Selection A fact is represented as a row of related numbers
where the first i numbers correspond to the i network inputs and
the last j numbers correspond to the j network outputs. A group of
related facts is known as a “fact set.” If two facts have exactly the
same input and output values, only one of the facts should be
included in the fact set. Once it has been defined, in most financial
applications the fact set should be separated into mutually exclu-
sive training and testing subsets.
Back-propagation networks operate in two modes: One is a
learning mode in which the network uses facts from the training set
to modify its internal representation through weight changes. The
other is a recall mode in which the network processes inputs from
the test set and utilizes its previously learned representation to gen-
erate associated outputs. The relative performance on the test set of
various trained networks is used to determine which net should be
incorporated into the final application.

ing variables:
1. Reliability, or what percentage of time you make money.
For example, if you made 10 stock trades and made money on 6 of
them, then your reliability is 60 percent. It’s the number of winning
trades you make divided by the total number of trades. Sometimes,
reliability is called the “hit rate.” Basically, it is the percentage of
time you get to be “right” in your system.
2. The relative size of your profits compared with your
losses when traded at the smallest possible level (i.e., one share of
stock or one futures contract). For example, the relative size of your
profits and your losses would be the same if you lost $1 per share
on losing trades and made $1 per share on winning trades.
However, the relative size would be quite different if you made $10
per share on winning trades and only lost $1 per share on losing
trades. It would now be 10 to 1.

In playing this game you want to develop a position-sizing
algorithm that is supportive in exploiting the expectation. In addi-
tion, you want it to be linked to the initial risk for each trade and
the ongoing account equity. For starters, consider a percent risk
algorithm where you decide to continuously risk a constant per-
centage of current account equity This sort of position-sizing algo-
rithm basically means that a 1-R risk becomes the same, no matter
when it is taken or in what stock or market it is taken. This is
because your position size is always a constant percentage (i.e., 1
percent) of your equity no matter how big the initial risk (R) is. See
Chapter 12.
In addition, you want to consider the potential distributim (the
order) of the marbles being drawn. The system’s winning percent-
age is inversely proportional to the length of strings of losing
trades. Therefore, you need a position-sizing algorithm that will
allow you to withstand potential substantial strings of losing trades
while being able to exploit the big winning trades.
Many traders have failed to trade a sound system because (1)
they were not prepared for the distribution of trades that the mar-
kets presented to them through their method and/or (2) they were
overleveraged or undercapitalized. You can estimate the maximum

Understanding the Key Parts
of Your System
This section is designed to help you construct your system
However, before you begin this section, you should thoroughly
understand Parts I and II of the book. They form the necessary
groundwork that you must have before you begin the actual con-
struction.
Chapter 7 talks about setups. Setups are conditions that are
necessary in order for something else to occur. I’ve put the setups
chapter first, because most entry and exit systems usually consist of
a setup plus a trigger for action. In Chapter 7, you’ll learn about the
most common entry setups-both for the stock market and for the
futures market. These are all setups used by master traders and
investors. Quite often they are promoted as systems all by them-
selves, and people tend to accept that because of the lotto bias.
However, you’ll be able to combine these setups with other critical
parts of a system to create something that really is worthwhile.
Chapter 8 discusses entry techniques. Your entry technique
essentially controls the reliability of your system-how often it
makes money. However, you should know by now that reliability
is not nearly as important as your expectancy in evaluating a sys-
tem. In addition, reliability can be high, while expectancy can be
negative-as illustrated in one of the problems in the last chapter.
You’ll also learn that entry becomes less and less significant to your
trading as your time frame becomes longer. Chapter 8 will show

are seldom discussed elsewhere. You’ll learn that you don’t need to

ties. However, cost becomes a very important factor as you trade
more.

intention is not to give you a complete system. If I did that, it
wouldn’t be right for you. My intention is to give you the tools and
help you overcome your psychological biases so that you can
develop a system that is right for you.
We’ll also be illustrating the parts of a system by showing you
what is commonly known about some well-known trading sys-
tems. You can see what parts everyone focuses on and how you
can improve them by emphasizing what everyone neglects. My
goal is in no way to criticize these systems, since most of them are
well known and they all have some excellent qualities. In fact, if
you like one or more of them, I’d encourage you to go to the orig-
inal source to learn more information. My goal in these chapters is
to review them in enough detail so that you can find out what their
strengths and weaknesses are and perhaps even improve upon
them.
One of the more important topics of the whole book is dis-

Using Setups
Speculation, in its truest sense, calls for anticipation.
Richard D. Wyckoff
Setups refer to conditions that must occur before other action is
taken. They are an essential aspect of most entry and exit portions
of any system. I’ve chosen to discuss them first, because they form
a foundation for the subsequent discussions on entry and exit tech-
niques
Many of the ideas presented in the “concepts” chapter
(Chapter 5), for example, simply have to do with setups for entry.
For instance, the concept having to do with “there being an order
to the market” in most cases simply gives you a window of oppor-
tunity during which you can expect a substantial move in the mar-
ket-that window is nothing more than a time setup. It certainly is
not an entry signal, nor a trading system.
For example, I recently consulted with an expert in Elliott
Wave--one of the “there’s an-order-to-the-universe” concepts. He
claimed that he was right on about 70 percent of his ideas, but only
30 percent of his trades made money He typically had a very tight
stop below his exit to preserve his capital. Quite frequently, the
market would take him right out of a position. Thus, he would
have to enter three or four times in order to capitalize on the idea.
In addition, by the time the market went against him three or four

FILTERS VERSUS SETUPS
I used to say that filters were one of the ten critical components of
a trading system. Chuck LeBeau, who often is a guest presenter at
our system seminars, then usually said during his presentation that
you should totally avoid filters. Filters might help you predict the
market in hindsight, but they wouldn’t help you trade the market
in the present.
Let me explain Chuck’s comment. Because of the lotto bias,
people want to know the perfect entry signal to the market so that
they can “control” the market prior to entry. When you are looking
at past data, the more you can use indicators to fit the data, the
more accurate those indicators will
seem to perfectly predict every turn in
the data.
Most trading software will have
several hundred indicators built into it.
You can use those indicators, almost
automatically, to totally curve-fit past
markets. For example, you can use an
oscillator, a moving average, and some
cycles and almost perfectly predict

The problem with illustrating such setups is that your mind
looks at them and gets excited about what might be possible. You
do not realize how many false positives can occur with any pat-
tern, much less a subjective one. However, this doesn’t not mean
that you cannot trade such a pattern if you develop proper stops,
profit-taking exits, and position-sizing algorithms to go along
with it.
Now look at Figure 7-5. It is the same as Figure 74, except
that I’ve pointed out three other l-2-3 patterns on the graph. All of
them would have resulted in losses.

sound and is worthy of some consideration. We will be discussing
other components of this Ken Roberts’ system in subsequent chap-
ters.

pattern.
Both setups in the Roberts’ method seem subjective to me. The
major high or low is fairly objective, but the exact time parameters
under which it occurs are not. In addition, the exact conditions that
define the l-2-3 pattern are quite subjective. Such patterns occur in
the market after almost every high that occurs-at least in a short
time frame-and Roberts does not define the exact time conditions
under which such a pattern must occur. Thus, there is a lot of room
for subjective error and for false positives.
Figure 74 shows a typical long-term high plus a l-2-3 bottom.
The low comes in mid-September 1990. The market makes a 2
“high” in October and then falls back to a 3 low (that’s not quite as
low). Notice that the market then goes on to make new highs about
a month later. Figure 7-5 Notice three other I-2-3 patterns in the same figure

CHAPTER 8
Entry or Market Timing fact, a number of books are on the bookshelves that make the
assumption that picking good stocks is all there is to making a for-
tune in the stock market. They have titles like How to Buy Stocks the
Smart Way, Stock Picking: The Best Tactics for Beating the Market, Haul
to Buy Stocks, How to Pick Stocks Like a Pro, and How to Buy
Technology Stocks.2 We will also make the assumption that reliabil-
ity can be an important criterion for entry signals in this chapter
and talk about some potentially good signals.
The second approach is to focus, not on reliability, but on find-
ing entry signals that will give you high-R-multiple trades. This
approach is totally different from the first approach, because it
makes a totally different assumption about what is important to
making big profits. While both approaches are valid, the second
approach has the potential to totally change the way people think
about trading.

Since most trend-following systems make money from a few
good trades each year, another reason for their low reliability might
be that the good systems concentrate on getting high-F-multiple
trades. Let’s look at some common entry techniques that might
help you with one or both of these approaches.
COMMONENTRYTECHNIQUES
Most people trade or invest using only a few categories of entries.
In the following section, we discuss some of the most common
entry techniques and their usefulness.
Channel Breakouts
Suppose you have a goal, as a trend follower, of never missing a
major trend in the market. What kind of entry signal could you Figure ~1 A JO-day breakout (indicated with a B) occurs August 2
use? The classic answer to this question is an entry signal known as
the “channel breakout.” Basically, you enter the market on either
the highest high of the last X days on the long side or the lowest low

Patterns
Many people take the visual interpretation of charts much further.
For example, the art of technical analysis focuses on the many types
of chart patterns that markets tend to form. Some patterns are
described as bullish and other as bearish. Thus, those patterns
could give you your entry signals. Types of chart patterns include
daily patterns such as gaps, spikes, key reversal days, thrust days,
run days, inside days, and wide-ranging days. These patterns are
typically used as short-term trading signals.
Other patterns are better described as continuation patterns.
These include triangles, flags, and pennants. These have little
meaning unless you wish to enter in the direction of the major
trend after a breakout from these patterns.
Finally, there are top and bottom patterns. These include
double bottoms and tops, head and shoulders patterns, rounded
tops and bottoms, triangles, wedges, and island reversals.
Obviously, these would tend to be entry signals for top and bot-
tom pickers.
Other charts are composed of candlesticks, where the differ-

was depressed over his recent stock market losses. During the first

Maximum Adverse Excursion

John Sweeney, the former editor of Technical Analysis of Stocks and trade
Commodities, has introduced the concept of campaign trading.” If
you understand the concept of R, mentioned earlier, you will
understand what Sweeney is trying to convey in writing about
campaign trading. Campaign trading, in my opinion, is simply
understanding that trading success is more a function of the price
movement once you are in a trade than it is a function of your entry.
Let’s think about the idea of excursion-what the price does
from the point of entry. When you start thinking about price move-
ment from your entry point, it introduces you to several more inter-
esting concepts. The first of these is the maximum adverse excursion
(MAE). This is the worst intraday price movement against your
position that you are likely to encounter during the entire trade. The
worst case is usually taken as being the high or low of that particu-
lar day depending upon whether you are short or long, respectively. Figure %Z Maximum adverse excursion in a long losing trade
Figure 9-1 shows an example of adverse price excursion from
an entry point on the long side. A bar chart is shown, and the dark

Winning and losing trades were separated in the table. The MAE
was entered for each winning and losing trade-both in terms of
the dollar amount and in terms of its relationship to the average
true range. Those data are shown in Table 9-l.
This is a small sample and not meant as anything more than
an illustration of how to use the technique” Notice the differences
between the winning and the losing trades. You don’t have any
winning trades with MAE greater than 1.5 times the average true
range, and only 3 of 24 winning trades (i.e., 12.5 percent) had a
maximum adverse excursion above 1 average true range. In con-
trast, 66.7 percent of the losing trades had an MAE above 1 average
true range, and almost half of them were above 1.5 average true
ranges, with a mean for all losing trades of 1.44 average true ranges.
Do you see a pattern here?
When you compile such data (and you give yourself a big
enough stop), you will find that the MAE of winning trades will
seldom go below a certain value. In other words, good trades sel-
dom go too far against us.
If you constantly check for what
this value is (i.e., in case markets
change), you will find that you might
be able to use much tighter stops than
you originally anticipated, The a d v a n -
tages of tighter stops include smaller
losses (although you may get a few more of them) and bigger R
multiples on your winning trades.
Tight Stops
Tight stops can be used under certain conditions, such as when
we’re predicting a major change in the market and the market
starts to confirm that prediction. Tight stops can also be used when
we are looking at shorter-time-frame data. If your trading method-
ology will permit tighter stops, and remember that this is also a
function of your personal tolerance, then you have some strong
advantages going for you. First, you will lose much less money
when you abort the trade. Second, because of pour small loss, you
can make multiple attempts to capture a big move. And, third, if

they are justified in doing so because most people don’t have a plan

that he now needed to spend at least as much time developing his

People just seem to want to ignore exits-perhaps because
they cannot control the market on the exit. Yet for those who want
control, exits do control two important variables-whether or not
you’ll make a profit and how much profit you will make. They are
one of the major keys to developing a successful system.

of exit will also produce a loss, but these exits are designed to make
sure you lose as little as possible.
The Timed Stop
Generally, people enter the market because they expect the price to
move in their favor shortly after entry. As a result, if you have a
meaningful entry signal, then a potentially useful exit is one that
will get you out after a period of time when you are not profitable.
For example, such an exit might be “get out of the market at the
close in 2 days if this position is not profitable.” Such an exit would
cause one to lose money, but not as much as if one’s worst-case stop
were hit.
The Trailing Stop
The trailing stop is one that is adjusted on a periodic basis accord-
ing to some sort of mathematical algorithm. The random entry sys-

One of my good friends, who is a professional trader, once
told me that psychological factors didn’t come into play when he

and everything was very mechanical. I said the factors do come
into play because you have to execute those trades. He agreed, but
still didn’t think psychology was that important for their trading.
Several years later, however, his partner got discouraged because
they never made money trading the British pound. When a trade
came up, they didn’t take it. That trade turned out to be the one big
trade that would have made their year. The moral is that psycho-
logical factors always come into play in any sort of trading.
SUMMARY
Most of this book has been about developing a high-expectancy
trading system. Expectancy is a two-dimensional surface related to
the reliability of your trading system and the relative size of profits
and losses.
Opportunity to trade makes~ a third dimension that gives
“volume” to your dollars in profits or losses. You must multiply the

I’m currently consulting for a company that is producing position-
sizing software that will do all the models we recommend and
much more. The software, called Athena,4 has millions of possibil-
ities for position sizing, so you can test almost anything. It works
with Trade Stations signals, and it has a few built-in systems.
Let’s use Athena to see how several position-sizing paradigms
perform in a complex trading environment. In addition, since stock
traders are the least likely people to consider the role of position
sizing, we will use a portfolio consisting of the current 30 Dow
Jones Industrial Average stocks.
All stocks will be traded with the same system on the same
data (i.e., from January 1992 through June 1997). We’ll use a very
simple system-a channel breakout, long-only system that enters a

determines how many solids contribute to your profits at one time.
Position sizing also points out how important your underly-

position sizing. With small amounts of equity it is very easy to get
wiped out.
Anti-martingale systems in which you increase your bet size
as your equity increases are the primary models that work. Several
anti-martingale position-sizing models were given, including:
Units per fixed amount of money. This model allows you to
take one position per so much money. It basically treats all
investments alike and always allows you to take one
position.
