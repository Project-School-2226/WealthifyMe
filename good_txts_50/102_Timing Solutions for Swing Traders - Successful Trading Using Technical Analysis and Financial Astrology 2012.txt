Foreword
Like many practitioners, my collection of books on technical analysis has grown over the years.
In the initial years, during the 1980s, when such books were few and far between, I bought
almost indiscriminately. Later, as my knowledge of the markets and analytical methods grew,
my purchases became more selective. This well-written book, which focuses solely on the
equity markets, will occupy an important place on my bookshelf along with Robert’s first little
gemofabook, PowerToolsforTraders (1997).
Timing Solutions for Swing Traders has something for the novice as well as the seasoned
trader. The first few chapters serve as both a learning aid for beginners and as a refresher
course for the more experienced practitioner, while the latter chapters show how to combine
andusetheindicatorsandmethodsdiscussedtocreateatradingplan.
I found Robert’s innovative approach to multiple moving averages, which he calls the
Queuing Theory of Moving Average Crossovers (QMAC), to be very interesting. I particularly
liked the way he dissects the interplay of long-term moving averages to anticipate major
support and resistance levels and his use of colored candlesticks to differentiate between
trendingandnon-trendingphasesbasedonsimplebuteffectiveconcepts.
It is the last chapter, on financial astrology, written by Peter, that I found to be most
fascinating. Having never explored this area before—and not being very esoterically inclined—I
found the material quite easy to follow. The astrology-based approach to selecting stocks, in
combination with the more accepted methods of analysis along with the section on projecting
future trends based on planetary influences, definitely merits further study. I hope the authors
explore this fascinating new area in more detail, with examples from other equity markets and
perhapsthecurrencymarkets,inafuturepublication.
I have known Peter since he was a rookie broker, and in recent years, I have come to know
Robert as well. I have observed firsthand how their approach to analyzing the stock market can
produce quite extraordinary results. Robert and Peter have many more innovative indicators

Preface
The title of this book, Timing Solutions for Swing Traders: Successful Trading Using Technical
AnalysisandFinancialAstrology,definesitsmission.Itisallaboutdetectingtrendandexploring
the best timing to trade. The first eight chapters are authored by Robert and cover
comprehensiveaspectsoftechnicalanalysis,includingasummaryontheTheoryofElliottWave
Principle and the Queuing Theory of Moving Average Crossovers. The last chapter was
contributed by Peter. It introduces the application of financial astrology to picking stocks and
cycles, to finding the best period to trade, and to ascertaining the best period of your personal
PartofFortune.
The book covers four dimensions related to trend analysis: price patterns, volume, price
momentum,andpricemovingaverages.Theobjectiveistodecipherpricetrendandtodevelop
the most effective and profitable method to trading. It will show how to use financial astrology
inlunarcycletrading,selectstockswiththebestpotential, andfindthebesttimeforprofitable
trading. And, it will introduce readers to the emerging trend of fusing technical analysis with
cycleanalysisandfinancialastrology.
This book is not about day trading of stocks and is not intended for day traders. Day traders
are very short-term players and they make trades during market hours in one trading day. This
is a book primarily for people who work from “9 to 5” and who do not have the spare time to
monitor their stocks closely during the day. They are more likely to be position traders who
make longer-term trades that may last from several days to several months, and can only find
time after office hours in the evening. Many of them would like to have some sort of technical
analysis method that can help them take better care of their trades, but they just do not know
where to start. They would like to read charts. However, there are so many methods and
systems to pursue that the whole process becomes somewhat overwhelming. This book is
dedicated to these people who want to be more proactive traders. It will demonstrate a simple
and practical approach to doing just that. It will not require the purchase of expensive and
sophisticated software, as we are dealing only with end-of-day data and not real-time data.
Other than the examples of charts in financial astrology, we are using MetaStock software and
end-of-day data subscribed from data vendors to illustrate the charts. The formulas in the
samples of this book are enclosed for the benefit of the readers. These formulas are not
exhaustive or definitive; readers can of course amend them to suit their own style of trading.
MetaStockalsohasmanyotherpopularindicatorsandsystemsavailable.
Our purpose is to show swing traders or non–day traders a concise method to trading and
encourage them to take the subject to a higher level, particularly in configuring the indicators
they will use for trading, management of risk, and use of financial astrology. In financial
astrology, we try to show the application of astro-harmonics and how they are being used with

After countless hours of research, we have put together the essentials of a practical course

regarding interpretation of analysis that we have encountered in our 35 years of trading

experience, and the book describes how to interpret developing patterns and trends. It also
gives examples of how mechanical trading systems are designed, and how a standard indicator
could be incorporated into a system. Taken together with the emerging trend of fusing
technicalanalysiswithcycleanalysisandfinancialastrology,itishopedthebookmayserveasa

How to gauge different market scenarios is one of the trickiest issues facing traders every

In the book, we have demonstrated a simple concept of a trading method. The stocks are
selected at random and are not selected to fit the system. The system is not a mechanical or
fully automated trading system, and parameters of the system and indicators are not
optimized. The basic formulas used in the system are provided for reference. The formulas are
simpleandeasyfortraderstouse.Itshouldbeeasyalsotoadjustthemforincorporation (with
their personal system design) into their personal trading method. The program has a built-in
color trend indicator to alert traders to the state of the stocks in the short time frame, and to
validate the short-term trend by the medium-term indicators of the system. In essence, we
want to trade when the short-term trend is moving in tandem with the medium-term trend,
and trade signals are executed only in the direction of the longer trend frame. The application
requires discretionary traders’ decisions to anticipate market outlook for the intermediate
trend. It uses candlestick patterns, Elliott Wave Principle, volume, and the interplay of three
longer-term moving averages to decide whether relevant price rallies or corrections are
expected to be short-lived or the start of a longer trend. It is also recommended to include a
protective stop-loss system in every trading system. There are no standard parameters or
definitive methods for applying stop-loss. Each trader has to define his own acceptable risk to
set the appropriate stop-loss. For reference, the formula of a simple indicator for stop-loss has
beenincludedtogetherwithformulasofthevariousindicatorsmentionedinthebook.
To a large extent, the success of trading depends on your frame of mind, money
managementability,andtradingmethodology.Havingahealthyframeofmindisaprerequisite
for trading stocks. The mind greatly influences how you trade and how you manage your
financial risk. Trading is all about making mental decisions. A frame of mind that is negative,
tired, or anxious is not the right condition for trading anything. On the other hand, a healthy
and cheerful attitude and learning to take a break from trading are indispensable factors in the
unceasingquesttoachievethebesttradingresults.

CHAPTER1
BePrepared
Trading stocks is 100 percent mental. Trading means the buying and selling of one or multiple
stocks to take advantage of price fluctuations, rather than just holding on to the stocks
indefinitely.Successasatraderisadifficultachievement;ithasneverbeeneasy.Addedtothis,
the 2008 financial crisis brought to the market a new age of volatility, as well as new thinking
and new approaches in trading. If you do not know what you are doing, trading will now be
evenharder.
Markets consist of a multitude of investors from individuals to institutions, each with their
own investment agenda. In aggregate, investors’ emotions of greed, fear, hope, and despair
dictate market fluctuations and directional movements. Similarly, the psychological state of a
trader may affect his trading results because his emotions influence his decision making. To
outperform the market and to succeed in trading, a trader needs to take charge of his
emotions. To start off, he requires a patient and confident mind. If a trader is confused about
what he is doing, the probable win ratio is zero and he might as well give up trading. The mind

, the Hang Seng Index showed that the market was in an optimistic mood for about 55
months from April 2005 to its exuberant high in October 2007. Fear began to take over in
November 2007, and the market finally cracked in January 2008. The financial crisis struck
across the globe, creating panic among investors. The collapse of confidence lasted about 13

After approximately eight months, the buoyancy of the market slowed down and investors
seemed to return to an anxious mood. Notice that the volatility of the market, shown by the
wide monthly range, was greater toward the end of the greed and fear states of the market.
The top window shows that the momentum oscillator stayed in the oversold zone for 12
months during the state of fear. During the optimism state, the momentum oscillator stayed
continually above the oversold line and rose steadily to the overbought zone, supported by
increasingvolume.
The market is always dynamic. It is oblivious to your wins or losses. But too many traders
blame the market for their failures. They do not consider for a moment that their failures are
caused by a lack of preparation and irrational emotions. Whatever the cause, the best solution
is just to move on to the next trade with a clear mind and in good spirits. A good trader should
not dwell on the past. A trader’s ego is his greatest hindrance to being successful. The best
approach isto turn emotion into apositive tool. Whenever anynegative emotions stir inhim, a
trader should take it as a wake-up call. He should not allow such emotion to blur his judgment
and derail his trading plan. The most common fault in trading is overthinking—dwelling on the
past and not keeping to the trading plan. Besides thinking too much, a trader may believe he is
always correct and will refuse to accept the reality of the market. Thus, he should make extra
effort to understand more of himself and his emotion, so that he will trade better and feel
better.

FUNDAMENTAL AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
When a stock price is compared to its intrinsic value, it is termed as “fundamental analysis.”
When the stock price is looked at from the angle of supply and demand, it is known as
“technical analysis.” Each method of analysis is just as useful and important as the other, and
both methods should be used in combination when reading the market and selecting stocks.
However, it must be remembered that all analysis serves as a means to estimate the value of
stocks.
Fundamentals refer to the financial information reported by the listed companies, which is
always historical. A fundamental analyst calculates the stock’s future worth based on the
company’s past reports, and projects its value and relative earnings. Fundamental analysts
study the change in profitability of the corporation relative to its revenue trend, costs, and
expenses, which will include an analysis of its business competition, its capitalization, and the
strength of its business sectors. Fundamental analysts should be aware of the potential risk of
changebetweenthecompany’slatestreportanditscurrentsituation.Ittakesgenerallyatleast
three months from the cutoff date of the financial statements to have the audited results
published. During that period, many things can happen and, as a result, the published results
may not reflect the current state of the company’s financial position. Nonetheless, one would
befoolishtoignoreallfundamentalanalysis.
Fundamentals are more determinable and deliver fewer surprise punches. After studying
companies with consistent earnings and growth, it should be possible to forecast these
companies’ earnings per share (EPS) and the likely range of their revenue and earnings growth.
It might also be possible to estimate the return on equity and the dividend payout ratio based
on each company’s dividend policy. However, it would be difficult to do so for companies with
volatile levels of revenue and earnings. Investors look for steady growth in both earnings and
dividend payout over time. This does not mean the investment dividend has to increase each
year. The dividend payout ratio is an important sign. If the dividend payout ratio starts to make
a series of declines, business may be turning negative and it should trigger an alert to reassess
theinvestment.
Fundamentalanalysisismorelikelytobebasedonauniformstandard,whichmakesiteasier
for investors to understand the results. Fundamental and technical analyses are not alike, but
there is a growing trend to combine both forms of valuation. In fundamental analysis, the P/E
ratio is the indicator most often used. It indicates the multiples of earnings represented in the
current price. However, the indicator has a major flaw; it tends to distort if and when the
currentinformationandthecyclesofanindustryhavechangedsincethelatestearningsreport.
In spite of this, the P/E ratio has remained a popular and decisive indicator used by many
analystsforvaluingstocks.Otherratiosareimportantaswell,includingdividendyieldandprice

Investors have a tendency to overvalue stocks by pushing their prices to extreme levels,
especially when such stocks are in hot demand for one reason or another. In such instances,

its industry, and when the P/E ratios are well above a specific level, the ratio can be used to
eliminate such stocks. Also, P/E ratios make it practical and easy to search for stocks trading at
a bargain price. Sometimes, stocks may have extraordinarily low P/E ratios because they may
be priced too conservatively and the potential for profit is limited. Other times, very low P/E
stocks should be avoided, as there may be certain undisclosed reasons why they are being
shunned by knowledgeable investors. A more sensible way, perhaps, is to tread the middle

approximate multiple of 20, four of which occasions (H1, H2, H3, and H6) caused major
declines. H4 and H7 tops have produced smaller corrections compared with other tops. The

Technical analysis, on the other hand, is the study of directional movement of prices using
charts.Atechnicalanalystlooksatastock’scurrentpricemovementsduringthetradingperiod,
regardless of its fundamental value. Whether a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its
fundamental value is immaterial. The only thing that matters is the price directional movement
andwhereitmightmoveinthefuture.Theargumentsarebasedontwocriteria:thatallknown
fundamentalinformationisreflectedintheprice,andallchangesinemotionandsentimentare
shown in the relative action of price and volume. No matter what the stock is worth, it takes
only buying and selling to move prices, without which no trade will ever be profitable. A
technical analyst does not question why the stock price has moved, but how. His only concern
iswhetherthepresentstateofthestockpricewillbeshort-livedorwillcontinueforhistrading
time frame. His challenge is to anticipate the next direction of the stock price and to time his
decisions to either buy or sell based on the correlation of price and volume information, price
patterns,andtechnicalindicators.
Basically,atechnicalanalystlooksatthemarketpriceactionanditsrelativepricepatternsto

It may be of interest to note that there are software programs that combine fundamental
and technical analysis into a hybrid trading methodology. Investors can use fundamental
analysis to screen a universe of securities and identify stocks with good fundamentals and
growth potential. They can then use technical analysis to determine the timing to purchase
shares, such as near oversold levels, or after a retracement of prices of a certain percentage
from the peak of a rally. In this book, we show another approach where financial astrology is
used instead of using fundamental analysis to screen shares. The shares selected on this basis
have greatly outperformed the shares selected on the more conventional basis, although it
must be said that more comprehensive research is needed to establish that the superior

performanceholdstrueunderagreatervarietyofmarketconditions.
The book presents readers with a broad range of technical and financial astrology indicators
that have been found to be effective in gauging market trends and approaching change in
trends. The wide range may appear somewhat overwhelming at first. The intention is not for
users to adopt all of these indicators, but, after a thorough review, to choose only those that
suit their style of trading and which they themselves find most useful. In particular, we hope
traders will also find that integrating some select technical indicators with financial astro
indicators can boost their results. Whatever the approach, it is imperative not to overanalyze
the market. As Mark Douglas pointed out in Trading in the Zone (2001), “I know it may sound
strange to many readers, but there is an inverse relationship between analysis and trading
results. More analysis or being able to make distinctions in the market’s behavior will not
produce better trading results.” We have found this to be true as well, and readers would be
well advised to take the time necessary to develop a simple yet powerful trading methodology
oftheirownthatdoesnotinvolveoverlyextensiveanalysis.
Another common habit besides overanalyzing the market is the repeated use of the same
type of information, whether intentionally or unintentionally, particularly in applying multiple
oscillators, so that the result of each oscillator reveals the same type of information. Having
one oscillator to confirm another oscillator will not serve the purpose if the calculation of the
oscillators is derived from the same information. At all cost this must be avoided. As John
Bollinger, author of Bollinger on Bollinger Bands (2002), puts it, “Multicollinearity is a trap in
which several indicators seem to confirm each other, but really do not because they are each
repeating the same message. A typical example of this is the use of several different
momentumindicators.”
Figure1.4
is an example of multicollinearity in three oscillators that use the same series of closing
price.

CONCLUSION
This chapter highlights two very important issues for every trader who wishes to trade
successfully in the market. Success in trading lies with the trader himself, not the trading
system or the trading software. A successful trader should have a plan for each trade and
shouldknowhowhewillapproacheachinvestment. Asuccessfultraderneedstobepatient,to

If a trader can take charge of his mind and quell the inner dialogue that creates all sorts of
contradictions, and if he can keep his eyes on the time frame of his trading and focus on
principles and techniques, he will stand a better chance of becoming a successful, happy, and
confidenttrader.

CHAPTER2
Let’sGetStarted
Technical analysis is a rule-based trading approach. There are many ways to analyze market
information, and the potential variables are endless. A trend is the general direction in which
prices are headed. In using technical analysis, the objective is to identify the probable trend as
early as possible. Unfortunately, early detection of an impending change in trend is not that
easy. There is no single method or system that does so accurately and consistently. Thus, it
would be better to use a scorecard approach based on the collective methodology described in
this book. In a bull market, most stocks go up and in a bear market most stocks go down. From
trial and error in our trading experience and in our research, we have noted that when a trend
is underway, four trend-related dimensions give us clues. These clues may not happen at the
sametime,butusuallyoccurwithinaspanofafewbars.Thefourdimensionsare:
1.Patterns
2.Volume
3.PriceMomentum
4.PriceandMovingAverages
This chapter will briefly introduce each of the four dimensions that need to be studied. The
purpose of the study is to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each dimension. The trader
will then be able to see from the reactions in each dimension where a change in trend takes
place and how to use that information effectively in his trading. And when the trader has
learned tostring together allaspects ofthe fourdimensions andtoapply their coherent signals
in trading, he will be trading more confidently. Gradually, he will realize that he is trading more
prudently and that the number of his trades has been reduced based on this trading method.
He will discover one of the golden tenet of master traders—“More trades do not equate to
moreprofits.”

PATTERNS
Patterns are a very important aspect of technical analysis. They are the shapes or structures of
formations that appear on a chart, including double tops, double bottoms, morning star, head
andshoulders,triangles,rectangles,saucers,andsoon.Patternsarethebodylanguageofprice
expressions and offer traders a means of forecasting probable price direction. There are two
major types of patterns—reversal patterns and continuation patterns. Reversal is a formation
pattern that indicates a likely reversal in trend is taking place, that is, from a bullish trend to a
bearish trend, or vice versa. The continuation pattern indicates a temporary price retracement
and on the breakout of the pattern, the prevailing trend will continue. Patterns are not
infallible. There is no chart pattern that will tell you with 100 percent certainty where the price
isheading.Butlearningthecharacteristicsofeachpatternformationandusingthemwithother
supporting indicators will give traders an edge in reading the market and timing trades. The
various patterns are described in Chapter 3, Essential Patterns, which includes candlesticks and
classicalpatterns,andChapter4,ElliottWaves,whichincludesvarioustrianglepatterns.
Candlestick charts place more emphasis on the relationship between opening and closing
prices, known as the body of the candle. If the high of the candlestick is greater than the body,
it is shown by a vertical line called the upper shadow. And if the low of the candlestick is lower
than the body, it is shown also by a vertical line, the lower shadow. Long upper shadows
indicate selling pressure and long lower shadows, buying support. The longer the upper
shadows, the greater the selling pressure, and the longer the lower shadows, the greater the
buying support. And if the closing price is higher than the opening price, the body is charted as
a hollow candle. If the closing price is lower than the opening price, the body is filled. If the
closing price is the same as the opening price, it will be shown as a short dash. The strongest
candle will be a hollow candle (price closes at the high of the day) with no upper or lower
shadows. The weakest candle will be a filled candle (price closes at the low of the day) with no
upper or lower shadows. Various important candlestick patterns are described in Chapter 3.
They are useful in gauging market sentiment and can provide valuable information when used
in conjunction with volume. We would want to be in the trade with a pair of bullish
candlesticks. The bullishness or bearishness of candlestick patterns should not be determined
onthebasisofasinglecandlestick.
Group patterns are formed by clusters of price bars over a given time period. There are two
types of patterns. The linear patterns can be distinguished as bearish reversals (top reversal
patterns)orbullishreversals(bottomreversalpatterns),orcontinuationpatterns.(See
Figure2.1
.) They include head and shoulders (tops and bottoms), double bottoms and double tops,
rectangle or line formations, diagonal patterns, and triangles. The rounding patterns are the
bullish and bearish saucer patterns, or rounding tops and rounding bottoms. Patterns do not
give outright buy/sell signals. They indicate market situations and serve as setup conditions for
a probable change in trend. The patterns described in this book appear very frequently in stock
trends and should be more than adequate to detect such probable changes of trend direction.
A change in trend to the upside should have the support of a bullish reversal pattern, and a
change in trend to the downside should have the pressure of a bearish reversal pattern. During
a period where prices are under accumulation or distribution phases, movements of prices are
contained within a short trading band like a rectangle pattern. Breakouts from these patterns,
supported by volume and candlestick patterns, would signal the start of the relative trend. An
important point to keep in mind is that traders should not try to be too critical when

All markets will trend up when the better-informed buyers have completed their
accumulation and will trend down when they have completed their distribution to the
uninformed buyers, who are generally the public participants. One of the key factors that
differentiates between informed investors and uninformed investors is the access to
information. Better-informed investors have earlier access to information whereas uninformed
investorsdonothavethemeanstogathersuchinformation.Thetradingactivitiesbetweenthe
informed and uninformed investors will cause a series of reactions that tend to have repetitive
patterns and cycles. Elliot Wave Theory is based on the premise of such reactions or
overreactionsofthecollectivebehaviorandemotionofinvestors.
Elliott Wave Theory has been around for decades, but there seems to be no consensus
among users as to how wave pattern analysis should be applied for maximum benefit. One
reason is the old habit of zealous practitioners trying too hard to pinpoint evolving price
patterns by crossing every t and dotting every i. The objective is not to label every turn all the
time,whichcanmakeanalysisofpatternsoverlycomplicated.TheaimofElliottWaveTheoryis
to identify the stage of the market and the specific setup of patterns to determine the trend
anditsprobablefuturedirection.
Briefly, the patterns of market prices are always in the process of formation, unfolding in a
set structure of five waves in the direction of one larger trend and in a set structure of three
waves when moving against that trend. The three-wave structure will correct the movement of
thefive-wavestructure.Afive-wavestructureisnormallylabeledas1-2-3-4-5andathree-wave
structure is labeled as A-B-C. In short, one full Elliott Wave cycle consists of five waves and
three waves. It is easier to grasp the theory if we think in terms of a set of two root
patterns—impulsewavesandcorrectivewaves.Impulsewavesarethosepricemovementsthat
are rising in an uptrend or declining in a downtrend. Corrective waves are those that are
declining counter to a rising trend, or rising counter to a falling trend. In an impulse pattern,
there are two countertrend waves, Wave 2 and Wave 4. In a correction pattern, there is one
countertrendwave,WaveB.
Elliott Wave Theory is a multifractal system in which each cycle can be part of another cycle
or form part of an expanded cycle. In its raw form, Elliott Wave Theory is about forecasting

analysis tools. That is, it is best to buy when the market is in an impulse cycle, and to sell when
it is in a correction cycle. Chart patterns delineate the imbalances of supply and demand; they
are important because they inform traders of the status of the market at any given time and
helptodeterminethelikelydirectionofthetrend.

bar will not be meaningful if it is not compared with its recent historical patterns. During an
uptrend,volumewillrisewithrisingpricesandfallduringacorrection.
Volume can also serve as a tool for guiding wave counts and in projecting extensions of
waves. For example, in a fifth wave, volume generally tends to be less than that of the third
wave. If volume is greater than that of the third wave, an extension of the fifth wave is more
likely. In any bull market, volume tends to expand and contract with the momentum of price
change. Toward the end of a corrective phase, a decline in volume often indicates a decline in
sellingpressureandalowpointinvolumeoftencoincideswithaturningpointinthemarket.
The discrepancy between volume and price spread is another indication to watch for price
reversal.(See
Figure2.2
.) Rising prices with low volume signifies trend weakness and increased volume on falling
prices points to further decline in prices. Heavy volume with narrow price spread at new highs

sign of buying support. Whether in an uptrend or downtrend, any price movement with a
comparative high volume will be deemed stronger than a similar move with low volume.
Generally, we want to see good volume on a breakout as confirmation of the entry/exit signals
and to distinguish a true breakout from a false breakout above resistance or below support.

==================================================

PRICE MOMENTUM
Price momentum measures the speed of the rise or fall of price relative to the selected period,
the results of which are plotted as an oscillator. Most momentum oscillators are plotted with
an average line. When the momentum oscillator crosses above or below its average line, it
generates a crossover signal, which is similar to crossover in two different periods of moving
average lines. The resulting momentum plot will fluctuate between its high and low points.
Generally, when the momentum is above 40/50, it is considered to be in an overbought
condition. And when the momentum is below negative (40/50), it is considered to be in an
oversold condition. Overbought and oversold conditions signal that the market is
overstretched. The center line is the zero line, and when momentum is above the zero line, it
indicates strength. When it is below the zero line, it indicates weakness. In a bearish market,
whenthemomentummovesfromabovetobelowthezerolineandthenreversesinanupward
direction above the zero line, it does not mean the downtrend is over. It just means that the
downtrend is slowing down. Crossover at an overbought level (overbought reversal) indicates
bearishness and crossover at an oversold level (oversold reversal) indicates bullishness. A
reversal indicates an increase or decrease of the price momentum and it may or may not
coincide with a price reversal. When readings are at extreme highs, price momentum is
considered to be overbought, and when readings are at extreme lows, it is oversold. When the
oscillator reaches overbought or oversold conditions, it is an alert to probable change in price
actions. And when there is a divergence between oscillator and price, it indicates an imminent
changeinthestrengthorweaknessofthemarket.(See
Figure2.3
.)
FIGURE2.3
Chartshowingadditionofmomentumindicatorintheupperwindow.
There are certain weaknesses in momentum oscillators. Momentum shows the current state
of the market relative to its past. Although the oscillator is a derivative of price actions, its
directional movement does not represent price trends and does not necessarily move in the
same direction as price actions. Momentum oscillators represent momentum trends. They are
not stand-alone indicators and, therefore, do not offer any advantage when used in isolation.
But when momentum of different time frames is used to gauge the market, it becomes an

invaluable tool.Timeframeisoneofthesignificant decisions wemakeinourtrading. Asstated
earlier, the trading method in this book is not for day trading. Data used are end-of-day data
and traders would only be looking at the market in the evening. Thus, the time frame for
trading will be longer than daily, and one should, therefore, be looking at the next higher time
frame, that is, weekly momentum. The MetaStock program can easily convert between daily

trade because the condition is not favorable and might pose a risk. A trade should only be

momentum is bullish and not in an overbought condition. In short, it means that the two time

==================================================

PRICE AND MOVING AVERAGES
The object of technical analysis is to get on the favorable side of the trend. An uptrend is when
prices are making “higher highs and higher lows,” and a downtrend is when prices are making
“lower lows and lower highs.” In an uptrend, the sum of the rallies will exceed the sum of the
declines, and in a downtrend, the sum of the declines will exceed the sum of the rallies. To be
able to spot trend reversal and to stay with the trend is the hardest part of trading because
prices do not move in a straight line. Of the various methods applied in technical analysis to
detect trend, moving average is one of the easiest methods to understand and provides good
visual means of spotting a trend. Trading signals are generated when price crosses above or
below the moving average. When price crosses below the moving average, it suggests sellers
aretakingcontrolofthemarket, andwhenthepricecrossesabovethemovingaverage,buyers
are gaining control. A trade may also be signaled when the shorter-term average crosses above
or below the longer-term moving average. Two or more moving averages will allow a trader to
seealonger-termtrendcomparedtoashort-termmovingaverage.
In this book, we describe the use of three sets of moving averages to determine entry and
exit signals and a prospective view of the longer trend. The first set consists of the short-term
moving averages. The second set is made up of the mid-term moving averages, consisting of
two moving averages: the 9-day and the 13-day. The third set is made up of the long-term
movingaverages,consistingofthreemovingaverages:the50-day,the90-day,andthe200-day.
The first set of short-term averages plots the interactions of two 5-day moving averages and
a 13-day moving average. The signals generated by the interactions of the three averages will

averages consists of the 9-day and 13-day moving averages. When the 9-day crosses above the
13-day average, and/or the close crosses above the two mid-term averages, it generates an
entry signal. An exit signal is triggered when the 9-day average crosses below the 13-day
average, and/or the close crosses below the two mid-term averages. A strong entry signal is

==================================================

In accordance with the Queuing Theory of Moving Average Crossovers, whether the outlook
of the market is bullish or bearish, price and its various multiple averages should fall in an
orderly alignment. In a bullish trend, price, being the leading indicator, is always above its
movingaverages,anditisfollowedinorderbythemovingaveragesoftheshortesttimeperiod
to the longest. As in the case of the third set of moving averages, when the outlook of the
market is bullish, the alignment of price and the three averages should be in a positive
alignment (from top down): firstly price, then the 50-day, 90-day, and 200-day averages. If it is
bearish, the negative alignment (from top down) would be the 200-day, 90-day, and 50-day
averages, and lastly, price. The market will cycle continuously from a negative alignment to a
positive alignment and back again. There are no limits or fixed data for the time period and
types of moving averages to be used. Expanding the Queuing Theory further, averages for
periods of less than 50 days could also be included in the set for a total reading of market
conditions.
Where there is a negative alignment of the longer-term moving averages during a market
decline, and where the corrective pattern is not completed, any rally will likely be short-lived.
The longer-term moving averages will generally indicate the resistance points. In a bullish
trend, where there is a positive alignment of the longer-term moving averages during an
uptrend, and where the impulse wave pattern is not completed, any correction will likely be
supportedatthelevelsofthelonger-termmovingaverages,andpricewillcontinueitsuptrend.
In summary, the rules of the first and second sets of moving averages dictate trade entries
and exits relative to longer-term market conditions as indicated by the longer-term moving
averages. The longer-term moving averages will be a guide to the probable support and
resistancezones,whichtraderscanuseincalculatingrisk/rewardratiosagainstentries.

COMBINING THE FOUR DIMENSIONS
We have described the usefulness of each of the four price-related dimensions: patterns,
volume, price momentum, and price and moving averages. While an entry or an exit may be
considered in terms of each dimension individually, a trader who is biased toward only one of
these dimensions will probably experience a higher number of losses. But a trader who is
patient enough to look for a proper balance among the four dimensions will definitely find
betterresults.
We have included a simple scorecard in this chapter (see “Keeping Count”) for use in
combining the four dimensions as a total approach. The first step prior to making any decision
is to see if there is a possible trade. We want to trade in the direction of the higher time-frame
trend.Theeasiestwayistolookattheweeklypricechart.Thereisnoneedtogothroughevery
detail in the weekly chart. It will be sufficient to look at three factors: the weekly price
momentum, weekly price and relative moving averages, and the position of the current weekly
price relative to its recent historical prices. If we are considering a trade entry, we would want
to see that the weekly price momentum is not overbought, and is not bearish, and that the
weekly moving average is gaining strength at a level of support. Comparing the current weekly
price relative to its historical prices will give traders a sense of the probable move, and where
the significant support and resistance levels are in a longer time frame. Based on a healthy
bullishsetup,wewouldthenlookfortheprospectivetimingonthedailycharttodeterminethe

BEYOND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
For those traders who are keen to advance their skills in technical analysis and wish to do a
better job in calling the turns of the market, the next step is to go into astro-harmonics or
financial astrology. Financial astrology is as useful as technical analysis in analyzing markets.
Over the past millennium, astrologers have observed how the interactions of various planets in
their orbits affect the markets. Just as the Moon is known to influence tides, emotions, and to
cause swings in the mass psychology of investors, the other planetary bodies also have certain
effects, thougheachinwidelydifferent ways.Itcantakeyearstolearnandmasterthissubject,
but there is no doubt that while technical analysis works well under normal circumstances,
added astro-economic indicators can improve technical analysis to an even more pinpoint
accuracy and can forewarn traders of a change in trend. A brief section on financial astrology is
includedhereinasapreliminaryintroductiontothismethodology.

FINANCIAL ASTROLOGY
Chapter 9 covers some basic aspects of financial astrology, including cycles, selecting stocks,
finding the best timing, and market forecast. Financial astrology is made much easier today
with computing software. The development of financial astrology in combined use with
technical analysis to assist in reading market timing and market directional movements,
particularly in the plotting of planetary movements on price charts, is gaining popularity. It is
likely that the fusion of these two independent systems will radically change the approach to
technicalchartinginthefuture.
Financial astrology is an analysis of financial matters based on the observation of planetary
movements. After trading the markets for some time, it will become apparent that major
change in trend (CIT) points often coincide with certain astro-harmonic cycles. In fact, there is
much evidence to show that astronomical cycles correlate with moves in the financial markets,
as explained in Chapter 9. Planetary positions, which are available through astronomical
almanacs on computer programs, may be plotted either as a horoscope chart or against a price
chart. However, the interpretation of planetary movements and the events they imply is best
explainedbyexamples.
For traders who are new to the subject, it may be easier to start using a chart analysis
program like TradeStation with an astro add-on module. The following charts are examples of
plots of the lunar cycles, the eclipse cycles, the planets’ positions, the planetary aspects, and

Chapter 9, in the section called “Using Lunar Cycles in Trading,” details how a lunar-phased
buy-sell strategy will produce returns which substantially exceed those of a buy-hold strategy
only over several years. That said, for those who are actively trading the markets, it should be
emphasizedthattheintentionisnottotradeonthebasisofmoon-phasedbuy-sellsignalsonly,
but if, for instance, the new moon correlates with a buy signal from a momentum system like
stochastics and moving average crossovers, then it lends strength to that signal. Conversely, if
the full moon correlates with a technical sell signal, it would add strength to that signal. Unless

, the black lines reflect solar eclipses and the blue lines show lunar eclipses. They are plotted
here on a weekly chart of the Hang Seng Index but may apply to any market. The correlation
with CITs is quite high, so one would always want to remain on alert well ahead of time for the

Furthermore, a little-known but valuable technique is to show projections 90 days before
and 90 days after an eclipse, marked with dotted lines. These projections often coincide with
important turning points in some markets. Certainly, in the case of the Hang Seng Index, they
correlate very well with CITs. With these projections, as shown by the dotted lines in

The next chart shows how a market often moves in alignment or within the boundaries of
planetary positions, whether geocentric (as seen from the Earth) or heliocentric (as seen from
the Sun). The effect of the planets is dealt with in greater detail in Chapter 9 under “Choosing
the Best Periods for Trading.” Usually, the various markets are affected by different planets.
The planets involved may also depend on whether one is looking at shorter-term cycles or
longer-term cycles. The former may be influenced by faster-moving planets and the latter by
slower-movingones.
Figure2.10
shows how the aspects of planets may help indicate the possible direction of a market. The
bars at the bottom reflect the most common aspects, such as 0 degrees (conjunction), 60
degrees(sextile),90degrees(square),120degrees(trine),and180degrees(opposition).The0,
60,and120degreeaspectsaregenerallyconsideredfavorable,whereasthe90and180degree

Traders may also wish to take note of the tendency of stock markets to react prior to the
moment when two transiting planets are in an exact aspect or in conjunction with each other.
So when the planets move within a certain angle or distance of each other, a company’s stock
horoscope(itspriceonthefirstdayoflisting)tendstoreact—upwardordownwardasthecase
may be—some time before the actual culmination of the transit takes place. Usually, it is a day

The tall bars indicate when one of the aspects has reached culmination, where the effect is
usually the strongest. These events often coincide with CITs or acceleration of the trend, as
shown by the arrows. However, as mentioned earlier, the share or index may react one or two
days in advance of the culmination of the aspect, and it is therefore advisable to watch the
action in the VZO and MACD indicators very closely in conjunction with the planetary aspect
bars.

CONCLUSION
By now, traders should have a better understanding of the importance of using the collective
signalsofthefourtrend-relateddimensions—pattern,volume,pricemomentum,andpriceand
moving averages—as trading guidelines. Generally, trade entries occur when the coherent
signals of these four dimensions are bullish, and trade exits happen when the signals are
bearish. In addition, this chapter has shown how the addition of financial astrology can help
further determine probable price direction and change in trend. But before we proceed to the
chapterscoveringeachofthefourtrend-relateddimensions,here’sawordofcaution.
After trading for some time and making some profitable trades, traders may face one
possible danger. Because technical analysis is a rule-based approach, the process becomes
repetitive. Traders may start to get bored with the routine and begin to neglect their trading
rules and methods. Boredom may cause traders to either adopt a complacent attitude or
deviate from their trading methods. They may easily overlook the risks oftrading. Toovercome

CHAPTER3
EssentialPatterns
The price of a stock that has been concluded during a trading period between a buyer and a
seller represents the agreed value of such stock for that time frame only. It is an equilibrium
pointatthatmomentintime.Thevaluewill,therefore,begreatlyinfluencedbyexistingsupply
and demand for the stock during that trading period. The existing supply of stocks is the
quantity that sellers intend to dispose of; the existing demand for stocks is the quantity that
buyers intend to buy. It does not depend on the number of sellers or number of buyers. Thus,
whenthedemandisgreaterthanthesupply,pricewillriseandwhenthedemandislesserthan
the supply, price will fall. Agreed value may fluctuate in a narrow range where substantial
volumeduringthedayisbeingtransacted.Thisrangewillthenbecometheacceptedvaluearea
or the equilibrium zone. When price moves out of the zone, volatility in price will develop, and
if the breakout from the equilibrium zone is accompanied by higher volume, the price volatility
onbreakoutwillnormallybegreater.Asolidtrendmayevolvefromsuchbreakouts.
Stock prices fluctuate to make the highs and lows of the day. The daily range is the distance
betweenthehighandthelow.Theweeklyrangeistherangebetweentheweekly(tradingdays
from Monday to Friday) high and low. Range is an important factor in reading price direction. If
the price moves upward from a low with expanding ranges, this means the buyers are buying
aggressively and overcoming the selling pressure. On an uptrend, if the price begins to increase
with contracting range, this means that the buyers are no longer buying as aggressively as
before, and it is probably a sign of an imminent top. It cautions one to raise a protective stop
closertothecurrentprice.
If the price moves down from its high with a large daily range, it means that the sellers are
selling aggressively and are overpowering the buyers. Generally, the downward movement of
prices with expansion of range is a sign that the downward movement will continue. In all
phases of price movements, volume is a good indicator of the validity of the move. If the price
movesdowntoanewlowwiththedailyrangecontracting,thisisseenasasignthatthesellers
arenot selling asaggressively asbefore, thereby signaling that apossible bottom maybeinthe
making. Taking note of these subtle signs will help to understand the flow of the market. While
a narrowing of the daily ranges in a downtrend in price is a warning that the prevailing trend is
slowing down, it does not necessarily mean that the current move has come to an end;
additional confirmation from subsequent market action is needed. When price ranges are
contracting as the price moves up with unimpressive volume, the market is vulnerable to
another downward move. Range expansion and contraction must always be looked at from the
perspective of what ranges are doing now as compared with what they have been doing in the
immediatepast.

==================================================

OPEN
The open refers to the price of the first trade at which a stock is traded for that day. It plays a
key role in the analysis according to the candlestick system. If there is buying demand, the
market will open up higher than its previous day’s closing, and if there is a lack of demand, the
market will open lower than its previous day’s closing. If the price opens higher outside the
previous day’s range, the buying demand is very strong, and if it opens lower outside the
previous day’s range, there is great selling pressure. Traders have to be cautious on such days
andexpectgreatervolatilityintheprice’smovementswhenitopensoutsidethepreviousday’s
range.
If the close of the day is higher than the opening price, then the buying power is stronger
than the selling power of that day. To the contrary, if the close of the day is lower than the
openingprice,thenthesellingpressureisstrongerthanthebuyingpowerofthatday.See

CLOSE
The close is the price transacted at the end of a trading day or of a trading period. This is the
most watched and most frequently quoted market-generated price information. Most of the
trading strategies, indicators, and oscillators are based on using the day’s close as the key
component. The close is often seen as the result of the struggle between the bulls and the
bears. If the close is at or near the high of the day and the opening was near the low, evidently
buying power was more powerful. If selling pressure was greater than buying power, then it
would have caused the market to close down from the high. If the close is at or near the low of

CANDLESTICK PATTERNS
In 1996, Gunduz Caginalp and Henry Laurent, from the Mathematics Department of the
University of Pittsburgh, published a brief paper, “The Predictive Power of Price Patterns,”
basedonsamplingsofcandlestickpatterns.Theyconcluded,amongotherthings,that“atrader
who has the same information as others plus the knowledge of this method will have a
competitive advantage.” It is said that the practice of candlestick charting was started in
eighteenth-centuryJapanbyamannamedMunehisaHonma,whocontrolledalargefamilyrice
business. He used this technique to monitor the daily movements of the price of rice.
Candlesticks charting has become increasingly popular since its introduction to the West in the
1970s by Steve Nison, who has published many great articles and books on the subject,
includinghisearliestbook, JapaneseCandlestickChartingTechniques.
Over the years and with advanced software programs, candlestick analysis has developed
intoamorevisualanddescriptivestudy,andcandlestickpatternscannowbeincorporatedinto
any customized trading system. For instance, in a customized system, if all candles are plotted
in red color in a downtrend, the software could further decipher and separate the patterns of
the red candlesticks into bullish and bearish candles. A bullish candle will have a hollow red
candle while a bearish candle will be a filled red candle. Very often in a downtrend, the
appearance of a hollow red candle signifies a support area and probable reversal area. On the
other hand, if the candles in a customized trading system are plotted as blue in an uptrend,
filledbluecandleswilloftenindicateresistanceandaprobablereversalarea.
Candlesticks plot price movements over a set period. Regardless of the time frame, a
minimum of two candlesticks is required to identify the probable market direction and its
relative strength and weakness. Identifying patterns that always work is difficult. Readings of
candlestick patterns should not be based on a single candlestick but should be made in
combination with other candlesticks. Candlestick patterns are more predictive when the
markets are at extreme overbought or oversold levels. A momentum oscillator would be a
handytooltochecksuchextremes.

Haramipatterns,asshownin
Figure3.8
, are the opposite of engulfing patterns. They are referred to as inside days in bar charts.
When a large white candlestick is followed by a small white candlestick at or near the top of an
uptrend, it is common for this bearish pattern to break downward. The failure of the second
candlestick to push price higher outside the range of the first candlestick indicates that buyers
are losing stamina. Conversely, when a large black candlestick is followed by a small black
candlestick, it is a bullish pattern and is expected to break upward. The reason is that the
second candlestick manages to hold off the downward drive of the first candlestick. Market
practice says to follow the break from harami patterns when the previous day’s high or low is
exceeded, because a trend will normally continue in the direction of the break. This pattern is

==================================================

DIVERGENCE PATTERNS
Divergence occurs when the movement of a momentum oscillator does not agree with the
price movement. Divergence gives signs of the hidden strengths and weaknesses of a price
trend. Prices may rise and fall, but if the momentum oscillator fails to confirm the
corresponding price trend, the resulting discrepancy is an advance warning of a probable
changeinthepricetrendintheverynearterm.
There are four patterns of divergences. They are the two classic divergences, comprising
bullish divergence and bearish divergence; and the two hidden divergences, comprising hidden
bullishdivergenceandhiddenbearishdivergence.
Bullishdivergenceoccurswhenthepriceisdecliningwhilethemomentumoscillatorisrising.
This pattern can be seen generally at a market low. Bullish divergence occurs when the market
is reaching a support level and is preparing for an eventual rally. In the beginning of a bullish
buildup, the price fails to show any signs of rallying as weak investors are selling to strong
investors. As more investors enter the market and when the accumulation process is over, the
pricewillrally.
The other classic divergence is bearish divergence. Bearish divergence is the opposite of
bullish divergence. It occurs when the price is rising while the momentum is declining. The
patternlooksforhigherhighpricesandlowerlowoscillatorvalues.Bearishdivergencehappens
when the market is preparing for a corrective decline. In the beginning of the bearish buildup,
price fails to show any sign of corrective action as weak investors are buying from strong
investors. When more strong investors exit the market and the distribution is finally over, the
pricewillfall.(See
Figure3.11
.)
FIGURE3.11
Classicdivergencepatterns.
Another pair of divergence patterns, known as hidden divergences, should not be ignored.
(See
Figure3.12
.) Like classic divergences, hidden divergences do not appear on every price move, but when
they do, they function equally well. They help to keep the trader on the right track of the trend



==================================================
                     PAGE 53

or to anticipate a trend change. Most hidden divergences indicate continuity of the prevailing
pricetrend.
FIGURE3.12
Thelowerpanelshowstwohiddendivergencepatternsbetweenthemovementofpriceand

Althoughpriceistradinginadowntrend,themomentumistrendingupward.Thesecond
patternisahiddenbullishdivergencewherepriceistradingatahigherlevelbutthe
momentumoscillatorisatalowerlow.
The first type of hidden divergence is hidden bullish divergence. Hidden bullish divergence
sees higher price lows and lower oscillator lows. In a rising market, a hidden bullish divergence
is formed when momentum oscillator makes a lower low value, but the price makes a higher
low. It occurs mostly during correction in an upward trend. Hidden bullish divergence signifies
underlyingstrengthinthepricemovementandoftenisanopportunityforthetradertoreenter
themarket.
The opposite pattern of a hidden bullish divergence is a hidden bearish divergence. Hidden
bearish divergence seeks lower price high and higher oscillator high values. In a declining
market, a hidden bearish divergence is formed when the momentum oscillator makes a higher
high, but the price makes a lower low. Hidden bearish divergence occurs mostly during
corrective rallies in a downward trend. It signifies underlying weakness in the price movement
andoftenprovidesanopportunityforthetradertoexitfromthemarket.
Whether divergences are classic or hidden types, they warn of potential trend changes. They
provide opportunities for the trader to reassess his position and to either exit from the market
or to commit to a new position in anticipation of the trend change. Sometimes, in a strong
trending market, several divergences may occur. The more divergences that are occurring, the
more significant they become. For instance, at a market top, the greater the number of bearish
divergences appearing, the greater the weakness of the underlying price trend; and, at a
market bottom, the greater the number of bullish divergences appearing, the greater the
strengthoftheunderlyingpricetrend.
In studying divergence patterns between the price and the momentum, an important point
to bear in mind is that the momentum oscillator is displaying the velocity of the price and not
the price trend. The momentum oscillator does not represent the price trend or the price
direction.
The trend is reflected in the directional movement of the price. In order to trade better, it is

DIAGONAL PATTERNS
Inherbook, StreetSmarts,LindaRaschkewrites,“Allyouneedisonepatterntomakealiving!”
She then introduces a pattern called Three Little Indians, developed by her good friend, Bill
Wolfe. Others call the pattern Wolfe waves, three drives, three tops, and so forth. There are
certain applicable ratios among the five waves in the diagonal, but for all practicable purposes,
it has been found that the pattern is reliable most of the time without measuring or counting
suchratios.(See
Figure3.13
.) It does not matter by what name it is called. As long as the pattern gives a good reading, it
willbeworthwhiletopaycloseattentiontoitwhenitappears.
FIGURE3.13
Bearishandbullishdiagonalpatterns.
The setup of the waves in the pattern is symmetrical, and wave 5 sometimes makes a false
breakout move outside the protracted line of waves 1 to 3. In other respects, the pattern is
similar to diagonal triangles, though perfect Wolfe waves are rarely found in charts of all time
frames and if there is one, it would take an inordinate amount of time to find it unless the
traderispreparedtobuyaspecialpattern-recognitionprogramtotraceit.See
Figures3.14
to
3.17
. The pattern consists of five waves, labeled 1 to 5, and can occur at the end of any
movement that has five waves, usually in wave C or in a fifth wave of an Elliott wave pattern
structure.

PATTERNS CONTINUED
Patterns indicate the psychology of a market. Martin Pring, in his book, Martin Pring on Price
Patterns, writes, “The more I work with markets, the more it becomes apparent that prices are
determinedbyonethingandonethingonly,andthatispeople’schangingattitudestowardthe
emerging fundamentals.” Another great technician, Garfield Drew, says, “Stocks don’t sell for
what they are worth, but for what people think they are worth. If it were not for the fact that
these changing attitudes move in trends and that trends tend to perpetuate, market prices
wouldbenothingmorethanarandomevent,whichwouldmeanthattechnicianswouldbeout
ofbusiness.”
There are two general categories of patterns, reversal and continuation. Reading of patterns
is based on the three basic assumptions in technical analysis: prices discount everything, trend
willcontinueinthedirectionofthepreviousdirection,andhistorytendstorepeat.
When prices continue to trend up, they become more vulnerable to profit taking and the
market becomes congested as sellers and buyers pit their strength against one another. On the
other hand, when prices continue to trend down, buying support will reenter as prices seem
more appealing to the buyers. If prices fail to continue in the direction of the previous trend,
they change direction and reversal patterns are formed. The ability to detect reversal patterns
oftenoffersthebestreward.
Continuation patterns allow the market to pause for a time before the previous trend
resumes, allowing traders to get out of the market or even to add new commitments to a
previouslyestablishedposition.
Patterns tell the behavior of a market and they can be predictive. Recognizing chart patterns
is a method by which we can gauge market trends and turns. Recognizing even the most
predictable patterns is not easy. However, if we are paying attention, we should be able to see
thattherearecertainpatternsthatoccurfarmorefrequentlythanothers,andtherearecertain
stockswhichkeeprepeatingthesamepatterns.
Prices do not move in straight lines. They fluctuate to make peaks and troughs. A simple
method to determine the primary trend and trend reversals is to observe the sequential
patternsofpeaksandtroughs.Whenpricesareinanuptrend,eachsuccessivepeakandtrough
will be at a higher level than the preceding level; prices will be making higher highs and higher
lows. In a downtrend, each peak and trough will be making lower highs and lower lows, and
they will be lower than previous levels. Generally, reversal patterns evolve when such
successionofpeaksandtroughsisbroken,signalingthatachangeoftrendistakingplace.
When prices get bogged down in congested price areas, patterns begin to form. Popular
groupsofpatternsincludethe“M”and“W”patterns,theheadandshoulderspatterns,andthe
rectanglepatterns.

“M” AND “W” PATTERNS
“M”and“W”patterns(see
Figure3.18
)arealsoknownasdoubletopsanddoublebottoms, respectively. Adoubletopisapattern for
two successive peaks, which may or may not be of the same price levels. The pattern looks like
an M. A double top pattern occurs when the stock fails to continue the uptrend in its second
attempt as it meets resistance pressure from sellers at its highs. In a market rally, sellers
suddenly take control and push the price downward. Price begins to retreat to a level that is
considered attractive for buyers. The buyers enter the market and push the price up to make a
second top where it finds new selling pressure, which pushes the price down past its last
trough. When the price declines below the low point established between the two tops, a
doubletoppatternhasbeenactivated.

A double bottom is the inverse pattern of a double top and has two successive troughs,
which may or may not be at the same price levels. It looks like a W. In a double bottom, prices
must close above the high point between the two bottoms before a trading decision can be
made.Oncethisoccurs,theimplicationisthatpriceswillrallyasfarabovethehighpointasthe

==================================================

HEAD AND SHOULDERS PATTERNS
Headandshouldersisanotherpopularpatternanditisquiteareliablereversalpattern.Itoften
has a symmetrical pattern in respect of the price magnitude and the time spent during the
formationofthepattern.
Basically, a head and shoulders top pattern is a bearish signal. It consists of a peak followed
by a higher peak and then another lower peak that fails to hold the continuing uptrend with a
break below the neckline. The neckline is the trend line drawn across the lows of the two
interveningtroughs.
The highest peak is the head of the pattern and the peaks to the left and right of the head
are the shoulders. The shoulders are priced lower than the head and are about the same
distance from the head. After a strong rise, the left shoulder is formed when prices face
resistance from selling pressure and make a correction to a level, which attracts further buying
support. When prices begin to rise above the last peak, or the left shoulder, sellers suddenly
take control of the market and push prices downward below the low of the left shoulder,
creating the formation of the head. When prices correct to about the level of the last trough of
the left shoulder, buyers begin to reenter the market to drive prices upward. This time, prices
fail to exceed the highs of the head. Normally, prices will face resistance at about the high of
the left shoulder and make a retreat downward, forming the right shoulder. A head and
shoulderspatterniscompletedwhenpricesbreakbelowtheneckline.
Generally, volume will be high on the left shoulder and low on the right shoulder, and will
increasesharplyonthebreakbelowtheneckline(see
Figures3.19

shoulders.Notethatthenecklinebecomestheresistancelinetothesubsequentrallyafter
completionofthepattern.
A head and shoulders bottom is a bullish reversal pattern in a downward trend. A typical
head and shoulders bottom has three troughs and two peaks. The first trough is the left
shoulder. The left shoulder is followed by a lower trough, the head, and then another trough
forms the right shoulder, which is higher than the head. A head and shoulders bottom is the
inverse pattern of the head and shoulders top and is considered a positive pattern. It indicates
a probable change in trend direction from a downward trend to an upward trend when prices
break above the neckline. The neckline is the line that is drawn across the two peaks of the
pattern. Volumewillgenerally behighestontheleftshoulderandlowestontherightshoulder.
It is important that the volume at the point of breakout of the neckline is higher than the
average volume during the formation of the pattern. The increased volume at the breakout of
thelinewillregistertheenthusiasmofbuyers(see

)andmarkstheendofthedownwardtrend.

In peaks and troughs, there are two categories of patterns: (1) bullish reversal patterns, such
as double bottoms and head and shoulders bottoms; and (2) bearish reversal patterns, such as
double tops and head and shoulders tops. In these patterns, the relative neckline is a very
important key. In a bullish reversal pattern, the neckline is the price’s resistance line during the
formation. After a price breakout, the neckline serves as the support line in a retracement. On
the contrary, in a bearish reversal pattern, the neckline becomes the support line during the
periodofformation,andafterthecompletionofthepattern,itistheresistanceline.

RECTANGLE PATTERNS
Theory is one thing, but getting down to doing it right is quite another. A rectangle is one
patternthatisdifficulttotrade,particularlywhenthetradingrangeisnarrow.
A rectangle pattern is a consolidation phase in which the bulls and the bears are in a tug of
war,withneithersideindecisivecontrol.(See
Figure3.22
.) It is normally expected for prices to continue in the same direction the market was trading
in before the consolidation began. An important point to take note of is that the pattern is not
completeuntilabreakouthassuccessfullyoccurred.
FIGURE3.22
Twoexamplesofrectangles.Thefirstrectangleshowstheforceofthebearspushingprices

takingcontrolandpushingpricestoanewhigh.
Rectangle patterns are sometimes called box patterns. You do not often hear market
commentators mention them in the news. They usually refer to the pattern as a trading range
oraconsolidation.(See
Figure3.23
.) Rectangle patterns represent a period of range trading during which prices move between
two parallel trend lines: the upper resistance line, which connects the highs; and the lower
support line, which connects the lows. Prices will test the levels of support and resistance
severaltimesbeforeabreakoutfromtheupperandlowerboundaries.Oncepricesbreakoutof
the range in either direction, they are deemed to be trending in the direction of the breakout.
An upside breakout from the box is a technical buy signal, while a downside breakout is a
technicalsellsignal.

InElliottWaveTheory,rectanglepatternsarecorrectivewavesandnormallyappearasWave
2,Wave4,and/orWaveB.
In general, a rectangle does not show any particular volume pattern. Volume will mostly be
light as the pattern develops, but when extraordinarily heavy volume takes place during the
consolidation, it provides an indication of the direction of the future breakout. Typically,
volumewillalsoriseinthedirectionoftheultimatebreakout.(See
Figure3.24
.)
FIGURE3.24

Rectangle patterns can extend for a few weeks or many months. We just have to wait until
prices break out of the support or resistance lines and go with the direction of the breakout.

==================================================

SAUCER PATTERNS
Saucer bottom formations belong to the group of patterns that seemingly have curve-line or
rounding turns. Prices during the period of formation, especially at the rounding turns, have
low volatility and move narrowly, forming a gradual bowl shape. Saucer bottoms are found at
the end of a downward trend and are considered to be bullish reversal patterns. The initial
downward slope indicates an excess of supply. The excess supply forces prices downward until
buyers enter the market at the low price at the bottom, which increases the demand for the
stock.Oncetheroundingiscomplete,thepricesbreakoutandcontinueinanupwardtrend.
Saucerpatternscanalsobereferredtoascup-and-handlepatternswhen,uponabreakoutof
the pattern, prices retrace to form a right handle that drifts slightly downward. This pattern’s
time frame varies from several weeks to several months. The longer it lasts, the more
significantitbecomes.(See

.)

==================================================

As prices move down toward the bottom, volume decreases, and prices enter a period of
consolidation at the bottom as trading bounces within a certain range. A rounded bottom is
formed as market sentiment shifts gradually from bearishness to bullishness. As market
sentiment becomes more bullish, prices make a gradual upturn, and volume increases as
investors become more decisive about the bullishness. In a saucer pattern, volume tends to
followtheshapeofthepattern,andacceleratesuponthebreakoutofthepattern.(See

AB=CD PATTERNS
The AB=CD pattern is a classic pattern found in all time frames. The pattern was highlighted as
the Gartley Pattern in H. M. Gartley’s 1935 book, Profits in the Stock Market. The key to the
patternisthedistinctparallelogramofABCD,whereAB=CDandACisparalleltoBD.(See
Figure3.29
.) Gartley did not specify any application of Fibonacci ratios, but in later years, technicians
addedtheapplicable ratiostoit.Theimportant ratioswerethatBshouldbeat0.618 ofXAand
Dshouldbeat0.786ofXA.
FIGURE3.29
Gartleybullishandbearishpatterns.
The concept of AB=CD is also mentioned in Elliott Wave Theory. In the formation of five
impulse waves (see Chapter 4, Elliott Waves), when Wave 1 is extended, Wave 3 may be equal
to Wave 5. And when Wave 5 is extended, Wave 1 and Wave 3 may be equal. Each point, X, A,
B, C, and D, is a significant high or low. The points A, B, C, and D represent three consecutive
price swings. AB may represent Wave 1 or Wave 3 in an impulse waves pattern, or Wave A in a
correctivewavepattern;BCrepresentsWave2,Wave4,orWaveB;andCDrepresentsWave3,
Wave5,orWaveC.(See

GAPS
A gap is an opening outside the previous day’s range, creating an area where there are no
trades.Inanuptrend,agapoccurswhenthepriceopensabovethepreviousday’shighandthe
space (the area between today’s low and yesterday’s high) is not filled during the day. In a
downtrend,thedayhighgapsdownbelowthepreviousday’slow.
Generally, most gaps are eventually filled, some on the next trading bar, while others may
take a much longer time and some may never get filled. It depends on the types of
gaps—breakaway, common, runaway, or exhaustion. Breakaway gaps are not filled quickly and
occur when the market is in the early stage as prices break out of a trading range or
consolidation area. Breakaway gaps move prices into new territory and do not often retreat to
fillthegapinsubsequenttrading.
Breakaway gapsarefoundmostly inimpulse waves(Wave1)orcorrective waves(WaveAor
Wave C). Breakaway gaps can be reliable trading signals, particularly when they occur during
highvolume.
Commongaps(see
Figure3.33
) develop within a trend and reaffirm the conviction and strength of the trend’s direction.
They are probably caused by going ex-dividend and the gaps get filled quickly. They appear

Exhaustion gaps sometimes signal the end of a trend. In an uptrend, they develop in the last
phase of the buying trend, when practically everyone is convinced of the bullishness of the
marketandbuyerscausethemarkettogaphigher.Finally,whenthereisnoonelefttobuy,the
uptrend is effectively over. In a downtrend, practically everyone becomes bearish on the
market, selling increases, and the market gaps down. Exhaustion gaps are likely to appear at
impulseWave5andWaveC.

==================================================

Gaps do not hold every time. They become reference points as long as they hold. The longer
the gaps hold, the greater the probability of the trend’s continuation. The farther away from
the previous day’s range a market opens, the greater the likelihood that the market has
temporarily overextended itself. When this occurs, responsive sellers will often try to narrow
thegapbysellingtopushpricestowardthepreviousday’sclose.
The gap is important because it implies significant changes in trading range and in the

governance practice to disclose immediately any price-sensitive information that is not of
public knowledge and which may affect its stock prices. However, such information is
sometimes not released in a timely manner. This may cause a difference between the time the
company becomes aware of the information and the time the information is disclosed to the
public. Therefore, timely release of the information may be delayed. During this delay period,
some tactical trading could have been implemented by smart professional traders. When the
information is finally released, it may come as a shock to the general traders, and in turn cause
agap.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter, two groups of patterns have been described—the short-term patterns and the
long-term patterns. Short-term patterns are often reversal patterns that show combinations of
price bars ranging from two to five trading days, and are much easier to identify when
displayed incandlesticks. Such candlestick patterns include the morning star, evening star, dark
cloud cover, piercing line, and so on. They give traders the underlying signs of investors’
confidence and alerts to the probable change in trend in the near term. Though a single
candlestick may indicate the bullishness or bearishness of a specific period, it is strongly
recommended, as described in the chapter, that trading decisions should not be based on one
candlestick. Long-term patterns take a longer period in their formations, which may sometimes
be prolonged to several weeks. They are the classical patterns having names that are derived
from their shapes, such as double tops (“M” patterns), double bottoms (“W” patterns), head
andshoulders,saucers,rectangles,andsoforth.Comparedwithshort-termpatterns,long-term
patterns indicate a longer-term projection of the underlying trend. Though short-term patterns
may appear more frequently than long-term patterns, traders should not make decisions solely
on the basis of short-term patterns without taking into consideration other supporting
indicators. A short-term pattern may be formed within the overall picture of the long-term
pattern, and when prices show a breakout from both patterns, the validity of such signals is
stronger.
Included in the chapter are two specific patterns that belong to the group of long-term
patterns. Traders should take note of these patterns as they are very useful in the
measurements of price projections. Also highlighted are divergence patterns and gaps. The
divergence pattern is not a price pattern per se; it is included in the chapter to stress its
importance as an early warning signal of an imminent change in trend. As to the gap patterns,
these are the fearful patterns that appear more frequently in penny stocks. There may not be
any early warning from price patterns or indicators, as gaps generally occur unexpectedly as a
result of a sudden development or announcement of information. This is the risk in trading.
Tradersshould,therefore,alwayshaveatradeplantominimizetheirrisks.

CHAPTER4
ElliottWaves
Elliott Waves serve as a road map to understanding the state of the market. The most difficult
aspects of learning Elliott Waves are the labeling of the first count, where to expect the likely
levels, and where to begin the next count. In counting Elliott Waves, the most common
difficulties are found in complex correction and identifying the beginning of Wave C, and in
completion of an A-B-C pattern. Under certain market conditions, wave analysis can become
extremely ambiguous and very hard to decipher. But when the count is right, it can be most
thrilling.
The Elliott Wave Principle was first presented to the investment world in 1938 by Ralph N.
Elliott.Histheoryisbasedonthepremisethatmarketpricesareareflectionofcrowdbehavior.
Each wave of price movement represents a series of emotional reactions by investors, which
havecertainrepetitivepatternsandcycles.
ElliottconsideredFibonacciratiostobethemostimportantfactorsindeterminingtheextent
of price movements, including the time movements in any market. Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, and so forth. Each number in the sequence is the
sum of the previous two numbers. A Fibonacci ratio is the ratio between any successive
numbers of the sequence. Elliott saw that markets moved in waves that corresponded to
Fibonacci numbers—in series of five up waves and three down waves. The five up waves and
thethreedownwaves,totalingeightwaves,areallFibonaccinumbers.
After the first four numbers in the sequence, the ratio tends to approximately equal 1.618,
the inverse ratio of which is 0.618. The ratio of 1.61803 39887 49894 84820 was named by the
Greeks as the Golden Ratio. In the world of mathematics, the numeric value is called phi,
namedfortheGreeksculptorPhidias,whofrequentlyappliedtheratioinhissculptures.
Fibonacci ratios are used to target levels of support and resistance. Target levels are more
reliable when they are arrived at using Fibonacci ratios than by other projection approaches. A
high concentration of projections appearing in the same area, or in the proximity of the area,
will be more dependable than that of a single projection target level. The most commonly used
Fibonacciratiosare0.236,0.382,0.5,0.618,0.786,1.618,and2.618.
Price patterns are always in the progress of formation, unfolding over and over again in a
structure of five waves in the direction of one larger trend, and a structure of three waves
whenmovingagainstthattrend.
Inafive-wavestructureofanuptrend,thewavesarecountedas1,2,3,4,and5.Waves1,3,

The three-wave structure, A-B-C, corrects the movement of the five-wave structure. Wave A
can be divided into three waves or five waves; Wave B is divided into three waves; and Wave C
is always divided into five waves. Each of the impulse waves and corrective waves can also be

WAVE 1
Wave 1 is the first impulse wave of the five-wave structure. Wave 1 is the beginning of the
trend movement. It is generally accompanied by a strong reading in the momentum oscillator,
especially when prices have undergone a prolonged correction. Wave 1 is used to project the
target level of Wave 3. Extension of the wave means there is a subdivision of the wave into
another five-wave structure. When Wave 1 is not extended, the target level of Wave 3 is
normally either (1) 1.618 of Wave 1 measured from the low of Wave 2, or (2) equal to Wave 1.
When Wave 1 is extended, the target of Wave 3 is normally about 0.618 of Wave 1 measured
fromthelowofWave2.(See
Figure4.3
.)

==================================================

WAVE 2
Wave 2 is the first corrective wave of a five-wave structure. Wave 2 will correct the movement
of Wave 1 but the correction must never retrace the entire Wave 1. Normally, it will retrace
about38.2to61.8percent.
The corrective patterns often found in Wave 2 patterns are flats or zigzags. If Wave 1 is
extended, the retracement of Wave 2 is about 38.2 to 50 percent of Wave 1. Sometimes Wave
2 may retrace as much as 78.6 percent of Wave 1, but it should not retrace more than 100
percent of Wave 1. In short, Wave 2 cannot make a new low. According to the Rule of
Alternation, ifthepatternofWave2isacomplexformation,thenitcanbeanticipatedthatthe
pattern of Wave 4 will be a simple formation. If the formation of Wave 2 is a simple pattern,
thenitcanbeexpectedthatWave4willbeacomplexpattern.

                     PAGE 79                      
==================================================

WAVE 3
Wave 3 is the most forceful wave of the three impulse waves. Wave 3 is never the shortest
wave of the impulse waves. Its slope is almost always steeper than Wave 1 and is accompanied
by heavy volume and strong momentum readings. Very often, a price gap will occur in the
middleofthewavemovement,whichhelpstoidentifysuchwaves.(See
Figure4.4
.)
FIGURE4.4
Wave[3]showsthesubdivisionofanotherfive-wavestructure.Noticetheoscillatorreadings
ofWave(4)andWave[4],bothofwhichshowthemomentumoscillatorfallingbelowthezero
line.
When Wave 3 is not extended or is not the longest wave, then either Wave 1 or Wave 5 will
be shorter than Wave 3. If Wave 1 is longer than Wave 3, then Wave 5 will be the shortest
wave. If Wave 5 is the extended wave, Wave 1 would then be shorter than Wave 3. Wave 3 is
the most likely wave to extend. When Wave 3 extends, the probable target could be as high as
1.618 or 2.618 of Wave 1 measured from the low of Wave 2, making it the most profitable
wavetobein.

                     PAGE 80                      
==================================================

WAVE 4
Wave 4 will often become the first support level of the corrective A-B-C retracement following
the completion of a five-wave structure. Wave 4 should not retrace the entire Wave 3. Wave 4
does not retrace past the end of Wave 1 or enter the territory of Wave 2. Frequently, the end
of Wave 4 is accompanied by extreme readings in the momentum oscillator. The momentum
oscillatorwillnormallydropbymorethan90percentfromitshighestbartobelowitszeroline.
Wave 4 normally retraces about 38.2 to 61.8 percent of Wave 3. Triangle patterns are often
found in Wave 4. According to the Rule of Alternation, the pattern formation of Wave 4 will
alternatewiththatofWave2intimeandprice.

                     PAGE 81                      
==================================================

WAVE 5
Wave 5 is the last impulse wave of the five-wave structure. At Wave 5, it is most common to
find divergence between directional movement of price and the momentum oscillator. The
target of Wave 5 is normally about 0.618 of the distance covered by Wave 1 and Wave 3,
plottedfromthelowofWave4.
If Wave 5 extends, then the probable target is about 1.618 of the distance covered by Wave
1 and Wave 3. When Wave 5 does not extend, it could be retraced entirely by Wave A of the
correctiveA-B-Cpattern.
A fifth wave’s failure means that Wave 5 fails to move above the end of Wave 3. A failure in
Wave5could occur when Wave3istheextended wave. Insuchaninstance, Wave5will relate
to Wave 1 in price by 38.2 percent to 61.8 percent. Wave 5’s failure usually happens when it is
the fifth wave of a larger impulse Wave 5 pattern. Wave 5 could also develop into a diagonal
triangle. A diagonal pattern development at Wave 5 usually signals the termination of the
trend.(See
Figure4.5
.)

THREE-WAVE STRUCTURES
In a three-wave structure, the waves are called A, B, and C. Corrections are always counted as
A-B-C. The three-wave structure, A-B-C, corrects the movement of the five-wave structure.
WaveBretracesthemovementofWaveA.
Price movements in a three-wave structure can be further subdivided into smaller waves.
Wave A can be subdivided into five-wave movements or three-wave movements. Wave B can
only be subdivided into three waves and Wave C can only be subdivided into five wave
movements or a diagonal triangle pattern. The formation of an A-B-C correction will therefore
consistoftwomainpatterns:A3-B3-C5orA5-B3-C5(see

Wave A is the first corrective movement of an A-B-C correction. If Wave A is subdivided into

Zigzags
Azigzagpattern(shownin
Figure4.15
) consists of three prime movements: a steep decline of Wave A comprising five waves, a Wave
B rally, and a continuation of the declining trend by Wave C. Wave C is always made up of five
waves. Frequently, Wave C will either be equal to Wave A or 1.618 of Wave A. Zigzags are
corrective waves and have the same characteristics as those of five-wave structures. Zigzags
canalsobeextended.

Complex Corrections
Complex corrections are formations composed of random combinations of corrective patterns
such as flats, zigzags, triple flats, and triangles. They are the most difficult patterns to interpret
inthewaveprinciple.
Sometimes an A-B-C correction is called an X-wave. X-waves are used to discern sets of
corrective patterns and are marked between corrective patterns in a complex formation. They
can be composed of any corrective structure formation. The Rule of Alternation also applies to
X-waves. When the first X-wave is a zigzag, the following X-wave will not be a zigzag; it will
eitherbeatriangleoraflat.

Triangles
Triangles generally are corrective waves. Triangles are patterns occurring between or dividing
two waves moving in the same direction: (1) between Wave 3 and Wave 5, or (2) between
Wave A and Wave C. Triangle patterns are characterized by a contraction in price range and
converging trend lines. Triangles are generally labeled alphabetically as “a,” “b,” “c,” “d,” and
“e.” The structure of a triangle is divided into five waves in which each wave is subdivided into
threesmallerwaves,formingana3-b3-c3-d3-e3formation.
A triangle can occur in Wave 4, Wave B, and in X-waves. Triangle patterns consist of
contracting, expanding, ascending, descending, and diagonal triangle patterns. While the
shapes of the triangles matter, the directional price movement is of more importance when it
breaks out of the triangle. Triangles can form as reversal patterns, but normally triangles are
seenascontinuationpatternsoftheprevioustrend.

FIBONACCI RETRACEMENT AND PROJECTION
Support and resistance lines and projection lines are areas where prices are expected to meet
probable buying support or selling pressure. At these crucial points, a continuing trend may
cometoeitheratemporaryconsolidationoratrendreversal.
In the MetaStock program, there are two utilities, Fibonacci Retracement and Fibonacci
Projection, which can be very useful in identifying the levels of various movements of waves.
Fibonacci Retracement will display a series of horizontal lines relative to the selected trough
and peak of a trend line. You can add or remove levels as you wish. The horizontal lines will be
useful to mark the likely retracement or rebound points. After a significant move, prices will
often rebound or retrace to ratios of the original move at or near the Fibonacci Retracement
levels, such as 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, 50.0 percent, 61.8 percent, 78.6 percent, and so
forth. Fibonacci Price Projection is very popular among traders, particularly those who practice
Elliott Wave Theory. Generally, the 50 percent level tends to generate a field of gravity around
it. After a long trend, price seems to easily retrace or rebound to the 50 percent level. It is a
numberthatisworthrememberingintrading.
Fibonacci Retracement is used to calculate the probable support or resistance areas of the
current wave swing relative to its preceding swing. An example of calculating Wave B is to
determine the Fibonacci Retracement Ratios from the length of the preceding Wave A. The
probable target level of a corrective wave composing A-B-C is measured against its preceding
impulsewave,1-2-3-4-5.
Fibonacci Projection projects Wave C from the immediate waves of Wave A and Wave B.
Wave C is often calculated at 61.8, 100, or 161.8 percent of Wave A, and 127 percent of Wave
B.Theareaswherethevariousprojectedlinesareclusteredwillbewherestrongersupportand
resistance levels are expected. We often wonder whether there is magic in these numbers as
they harmonize with market moves, or they are made real because many traders are making
decisions based on the same numbers. It does not matter what the reality is, as long as we
knowhowtousethenumbersfruitfully.

In
Figure4.29
, plots of the ratios of retracement for the major swing (OX) from $3.35 to $7.87 are
displayed by the Fibonacci Retracement to mark the probable support levels in the downswing.
The ratios are 23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8 percent, and 78.6 percent. Interestingly, at every first test of
pricesatthesesupportlevels,pricesmakearebound.Thischartprovidesexcellentexamplesof
symmetry of wave movements and application of Fibonacci ratios. The first example of the
Fibonacci Projection is the projection from point Z on February 9, 2011, of the relative swing, X
to Y. The resulting target levels are projected at 61.8, 100, and 161.8 percent, as shown on the
chart. Of the three target levels, 61.8 and 161.8 percent closely match the OX retracement
ratios; 61.8 percent projection ratio to 38.2 percent retracement ratio, and 161.8 percent
projection ratio to 78.6 percent retracement ratio. The 100 percent projection ratio is in
proximity tothe 100 percent retracement ratio. Prices seem tohold when they hit these levels.
The second example is the B Retracement of Y1 to Z1, which is an AB=CD pattern (YZ=Y1Z1 in

APPLICATION OF ELLIOTT WAVE ANALYSIS
TheElliottWavePrincipleenablestraderstoformulateasuitabletradingstrategyasthemarket
progresses. It provides a tool to effectively monitor the position of the market relative to the
trendandtheprobabletargetofthemarket’smovements.
The wave principle works better if it is applied to market averages and blue-chip stocks that
are supported by active turnover. Generally, it is not practical to apply wave analysis to thinly
traded stocks or penny stocks if such stocks have no transactions or supporting volume. When
turnover starts to dwindle to practically zero and prices stay dormant for weeks, there is no
possible way to do any counting because no transactions are being done and there will only be
a horizontal line. It is not practical to get bogged down in detailing every small wave or in
pinpointing each of the corrective counts. It is a common mistake to try to count every move,
whichnotonlyovercomplicatesthematter,butmayleadtodeepconfusion.
When reviewing the count of waves, count the broadest swings first. If the counts total 5, 9,
or 13, the pattern is an impulse wave pattern. Then dissect the waves to see if a fit can be
made.Ifthebroadswingstotal3,7,or11,thepatternisacorrectivewavepattern.

CONCLUSION
ThebasictenetofElliottWaveTheoryisthatmarketmovementsarebasedoncrowdbehavior.
Market movements occur as a series of impulse and corrective waves, and these movements
can occur in predictable cycles. A bullish swing will be corrected by a bearish swing. The bullish
swing will consist of five waves, three waves up and two waves down, and the bearish swing
will consist of three waves, two waves down and one wave up. The sum of the waves in the
entire cycle will be eight waves. Impulse waves refer to the waves in the bullish swing, and are
numberedas1,2,3,4,and5.Andcorrectivewavesrefertothewavesinthebearishswing,and
are numbered as A, B, and C. Impulse waves are waves that move in the direction of the main
trend, and corrective waves are waves that move in the opposite direction of the main trend.
Impulse waves can be further broken down into another set of minor impulse waves, and
likewise, corrective waves can be further broken down into another set of minor corrective
waves. The cycle can be repeated as it expands or contracts in accordance with different time
frames.Allsuchimpulseandcorrectivewavesadheretotherulesofthetheory.
Elliott Wave Theory can be used effectively when applied, as described in this chapter, to a
suitable trading strategy in which risk can be minimized. One difficulty is in identifying the
count, and recognizing whether waves are impulse waves or corrective waves. Another
problem is in determining which phase of the market the prices are moving in according to the
theory, in order to predict the next probable direction and target. Counting every wave can be
subjective, but if the trader can identify the direction of the primary wave, he can still make a
profitabletrade.Hereareseveralguidelinesthatmayhelptraderstocountthewaves.
The first guideline is for getting the counts right. Getting the right count may be made more
difficult by a complex structure comprised of impulse waves and corrective waves of major
waves, minute waves, and subwaves, and so on. Traders, therefore, should try to identify the
counts on a best-effort basis. Traders should avoid getting bogged down in trying to identify
every exact count and being too concerned about getting the wrong count. Wave counting has
a high degree of subjectivity. The best approach to wave counting is to determine the primary
count so as to get the bigger picture. Doing a wave count of the longer time frame, that is,
weekly, is a good way to find out the state of the market. This will protect the trader’s position
evenifhegetsthecountwronginthedailytimeframe.
The second guideline is for locating trades that have less risk in accordance with the primary
trend, and avoiding trades that have greater risk. For example, picking trades at the end of the
fifthimpulsewaveorthebeginningofacorrectiveWaveCcanleadtohugelosses.
The third guideline is for learning to differentiate impulse waves from corrective waves.
Correctivewavesfrequentlytendtooverlap.InanA-B-Ccorrection,WaveCwillexceedthelow
of Wave A, and when Wave C moves back into the range of Wave A, it has made an overlap
movement. When Wave C rallies beyond the peak of Wave B, the correction is deemed
completed. In an impulse wave pattern, Wave 1, Wave 3, and Wave 5 should not overlap each
otherandshouldcomplywiththesethreerules:
1.Wave2cannotgobelowthebeginningofimpulseWave1.
2.Wave3cannotbetheshortestwaveofthethreewaves.
3.Wave4shouldnotoverlapimpulseWave1.
If Wave 2 goes below Wave 1, then the uptrend is invalidated. And if the retracement of
Wave4overlapsWave1,italsoviolatestherulesoftheimpulsewaves.Wave3canbeequalto

==================================================

Wave 1, or Wave 3 can be equal to Wave 5, but Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three
waves. This rule is probably derived from the observation that, in a strong market move, the
second upward wave (Impulse Wave 3) appears frequently to be the strongest of the three
waves. But when Wave 1 is extended in a strong trend, Wave 3 will equate with Wave 5. And
also when Wave 5 is extended in a strong trend, Wave 3 will equate with Wave 1. The
understandingoftheseruleswillhelptodistinguishtrendingwavesfromcorrectivewaves.
Thefourthguidelineisforcheckingtheslopesofthethreeimpulsewaves(Wave1,3,and5).
They will generally be steeper than the slopes of the corrective waves (Wave 2 and 4). In a
bearish reversal of a major market correction, A-B-C, the slopes of Wave A and Wave C will be
steeper than that of Wave B. In their steep declines, Wave A and Wave C will also show strong
impulse waves and Wave C will be the strongest of the three waves in the corrective waves. To
distinguishtheimpulsewavesfromthecorrective waves,itishelpfultolookattheslopeofthe
relativewaves.
The fifth guideline is for looking at the overbought or oversold values of the Elliott Wave
Oscillator (EWO), which is popularly used to check Wave 4. EWO is a 34-period price moving
average subtracted from the 5-day price moving average. The difference is plotted as a
histogram. The concept of EWO is that the highest/lowest point of the oscillator is related to
the bullish/bearish Wave 3 of the swing. When price is in an upswing, Wave 3 should be
reflected by the highest point of the oscillator, and when price is in a downswing, Wave 3
should be reflected by the lowest point of the oscillator. The correction of Wave 4 should be
over when Wave 4 crosses above the zero line in an upswing, and the correction of Wave 4
shouldbeoverwhenWave4crossesbelowthezerolineinadownswing.
Lastly, inanimpulse wave pattern, the patterns inWave 2andWave 4will alternate. Thatis,
if Wave 2 has a simple pattern, then Wave 4 will probably have a complex pattern. This
knowledgewillhelptraderstolocateWave2andWave4.InWave1,Wave2shouldbegreater
in time and price than any correction within Wave 1. In Wave 3, Wave 4 will also be greater in
timeandpricethananycorrectionwithinWave3.

CHAPTER5
Volume
Volume represents the number of stocks transacted between buyers and sellers during a
specifiedperiod,asshownin
Figure5.1
. The period may be one day, one week, or one hour. The specified length of the period
depends on the analyst. If we wish to arrive at a short-term view of the market, the price and
volume should be analyzed daily or even hourly. On the other hand, a longer-term analysis
would require a longer time frame. To determine the trend of volume, a running record should
be maintained to compare the daily volume with previous figures. However, there is no
standard rule as to the requisite number of days that should be used. Volume is generally
plottedasahistogrambelowthecorrespondingpriceaction.

READING VOLUME
Volume is not always easily deciphered. Is the market trying to tell us something when an
exceptionally low volume occurs in a single day, or when an exceptionally high volume was
transacted recently? A single volume bar by itself will not be meaningful. Volume is always
analyzed in conjunction with the price movement of a stock as it develops with the market’s
changing activity. Volume is the key to evaluating price directional movement and shows the
market’s ability to facilitate trade. It serves as a gauge of the strength of market development
andshowswhensuchmoney-flowiseitherincreasingorslowingdown.
Under normal market conditions, volume tends to expand and contract with the price trend;
the movement of price and volume should be similar progression. During the upward price
movement, volume should expand; and during the downward price movement, volume should
contract. We use volume to assess the strength and health of the prevailing trend. The specific
number ofasingle volume barisnot important andthe interpretation ofvolume should not be

The use of volume as an indicator is more reliable when it refers to heavy turnover stocks.
Volume of secondary securities with little or no trading volume will not provide reliable clues.
Volume is the indicator of the market’s ability to facilitate trade. Even in a bullish market, if
volume is decreasing, then the likelihood of a continuing uptrend is in question. A market that
isnotfacilitatingtradewillnotsurviveforlong.
Volume is a combination of activity by buyers and sellers. Thus, all markets tend to seek to
tradeatanacceptedpricelevelthatmaximizesvolume.Ifamarketisnotallowingtradeatsuch
price level, it will seek a new level that will provide better trading. Thus, if the price movement
is relatively static and volume continues to decline, the chances are that the market will break

Market change offers both risk and opportunity. The important point is to identify market
change as it is developing. By using volume as an added tool, a trader can anticipate market
behavior in the early stages of change. When movements of volume and price are not
progressing in similar order, it warns of a probable change of trend. The firmness of the stock
trend is expected to weaken when advancing price is accompanied by diminishing volume, as
decreasing volume indicates a rejection of higher prices. And when declining price is
accompanied by a trend in increased volume, it indicates an overhang of selling pressure. The
trend is expected to be strong when advancing price is accompanied by a trend in increasing
volume. Often, a low point in volume indicates a quiet market or an imminent turning point in
the market. If the volume trend does not expand while the price trend is rising, it is an
indication that the price movement is approaching a resistance level. As long as the volume
trend continues to expand with the upward price trend, it can be assumed that further
advancesinpricesarelikely.
Normally, volume will diminish in a declining market and expand in an advancing market. In
Elliott’s wave principle, volume pattern at Wave 2 will be less than that of Wave 1, and volume
at Wave 4 will be less than that of Wave 3. Volume of Wave 3 will be higher than volume at
Wave 1. Volume at Wave 5 can be lower than that of Wave 3, indicating the termination of the
overall wave movement. If the volume at Wave 5 is greater than that of Wave 3, it indicates
thatWave5willlikelybeextended.

Volume increases as the price rallies and decreases as the price pulls back into a
consolidation pattern. When the price breaks upward away from its consolidation, buyers start
buying heavily, as indicated by the increase in volume. When volume starts to decline as price
continues its upward move, it gives a warning that a topping of the price is near. When price
breaksdownwardwithincreasingvolume,itsignalstheendoftheupwardpricetrend.
Volume is useful to confirm whether a current move is likely to continue or is merely a false
start. In general, most market participants are bullish and are aggressive buyers. The stock
market is an active battleground where a constant battle is going on between the buyers and
sellers.Volumeanalysismayoftenprovidecluesastowhoisgainingtheupperhand.

MONEY-FLOW INDICATOR
Besides plotting the volume data to monitor the correlation of price and volume, nowadays,
with the ease of computers, various oscillators have been developed to quantify the
relationship between price and volume. These indicators are generally called money-flow
indicators. There are many of them. The main purpose of price volume indicators is to
segregate the total volume into positive volume and negative volume, which may reveal a new
condition of the market when derived from certain calculations with the price. A money-flow
indicator can be used as a stand-alone indicator, but it is better to combine it with another
price-derivativetradingsystem.
Figure5.8
shows a simple money-flow indicator called volume zone oscillator (VZO). VZO is easy to
understand.
FIGURE5.8
Volumezoneoscillatorshowsadrasticdroponthedayoftheannouncementofasubstantial
placingofstocks,whichcausesthepricetoopenwithadownwardgap.However,prices
subsequentlyrecoverandrallybacktotheprevioushigh.
VZO was developed by Walid Khalil and David Steckler. Details of the indicator and how to
useitarestatedintheMay2011issueof TechnicalAnalysisoftocks&Commodities magazine
and in the IFTA Journal, 2008 edition. The original formula, together with its proposed trading
method,isalsodescribedinthearticles.
Certain modifications have been made to VZO as it is shown in the example, including the
addition of the scale factor to allow the plotting of daily percentage change of moving average
volume. This allows readers to understand the relationship of volume and the concept of
positive volume as represented by VZO. VZO is positive when the closing price is greater than
the previous closing price. A moving average line is also added to let readers see the bigger
picture of the money-flow trend. Readers may remove the plot of the daily percentage change
ofmovingaveragevolumewhentheyarefamiliarwiththeoverallconcept.
Reading VZO is just like reading any momentum oscillator. Its main functions include signals
for trade entries and exits. The indicator is basically divided into four zones. The market is
positive when VZO stays above the 50 percent level and negative when it is below 50 percent.
When the market istrending positively, the indicator will fluctuate between 50 and70 percent,



==================================================
                     PAGE 115                     
==================================================

the bullish zone. And when the market is trending negatively, it will fluctuate between 50 and
30 percent, the bearish zone. In a trading market, VZO will generally move between its 30 and
70 percent lines. The market is deemed to be overbought when it is above 70 percent, and in
an extreme overbought condition when it is above 80 percent. On the contrary, the market is
deemed to be oversold when it is below 30 percent, and in an extreme oversold condition
when it is below 20 percent. Signs of weakness or strength in the market are sometimes
reflectedinthedivergencebetweentheindicatorsandpricemovements.
The horizontal percentage lines serve as the signal lines. When VZO crosses from below the
30 percent line to above, a trade entry is indicated, and when VZO crosses from above the 70
percent line to below, an exit entry is indicated. When the VZO moving from below crosses the
50 percent line, it also indicates an entry signal. But when VZO declines from above the 50
percent line and reenters to cross above the 50 percent line again, a buffer line of 57.5 percent

CONCLUSION
Theaimofthischapter istoshowtraders theimportance ofunderstanding volume intechnical
analysis and how volume can be used to identify the change in trend. When volume is used in
conjunction with other supporting indicators, the probability of picking a winning trade is
increased. Price represents the consensus value in a transaction between the buyer and seller,
and volume represents the financial commitment. In short, volume is the liquidity of the
market, without which the market is stagnant. And so, volume is deemed to be the driving
force of price movements. Generally, a rising price trend has to be supported by a positive
volume trend. When volume fails to support the continuing rising price, it signals a weakening
oftherisingpricetrend.Ontheotherhand,whenthepriceisdecliningwithincreasingvolume,
it confirms the continuity of the bearish outlook. A market is healthy when the trends of both
volume and prices are moving in tandem. But when the movement of price starts to diverge
with the volume trend, the continuation of the prevailing market trend is in doubt. For
example,whenaprice,tradinginanarrowrange,failstocontinueitsrisingtrenddespiteheavy
volume, traders should take note as the price may have reached a strong resistance level. And
in reverse, traders should also exercise caution when heavy volume cannot push the price any
lower and price continues to hold its trading in narrow ranges; it may indicate the price has
reachedastrongsupportlevel.Whenpricespikesupwithunconvincingvolume,thepricespike
is usually short-lived. But when the price spikes up on heavy volume, traders should pay
attention to a probable change in trend, and look for confirmation from other indicators. In
summary, the importance of volume should not be overlooked as it often presages price
direction.

Price is the only key that leads the direction of trend. There is nothing on a chart that matters
morethanprice.
Dataofdailytransactionsofpricesaregenerallyreportedwithinformationofthepricerange
consisting of open-high-low-close, volume, and turnover of shares. The information is then

All indicators in technical analysis are mathematical attempts to predict the future trend of
stock prices based on historical data. Indicators are used as added value to the analysis of price
movementstoformbuyingandsellingdecisions.Indicatorsarenotindubitableandshouldonly
be used as handy tools. In calculating indicators, it is important to ensure that price data are
adjusted accordingly if there are changes to the company’s equities as a result of schemes of
arrangements, rights issues, or bonus issues. It is also necessary to make adjustments to the
data when trading in the shares is suspended. Such suspension may last from one day to
several months. If the price data are not adjusted, especially when trading in the shares is
suspended for a long period, it is not advisable to do any wave count or any reading of the
indicatorsorpatternsfollowingtheresumptionoftrading.

A good chart layout should facilitate meaningful reading of price movements. The layout
should not be crowded with too many indicators. It should have informative indicators that tell
the different aspects of the market, such as a trend indicator to show the probable direction of
the trend, a momentum indicator to measure the speed at which price is changing, and a
volume indicator to measure the stock activities. On no account should the layout have similar
typesofindicators,whosefunctionsareofthesamenatureandparameters.
Oscillators are indicators that are constructed so that the results are plotted between
positive and negative levels, in which case the centerline is 0. If a plot fluctuates within a range
of0to100,thecenterlineis50.
Oscillators areusefulinidentifying overbought andoversold conditions ofthemarket, andin
divulging divergence of directional movements between oscillators and prices. When the
oscillator is above the centerline, the interpretation is positive, and when it is below the
centerline, it is negative. When the oscillator is positive and shows readings in the upper
positive range, it suggests that the market is overbought and is due for a correction. On the

other hand, when the oscillator is negative and shows readings at the bottom of the negative
range,itsuggestsanoversoldmarketthatisdueforarebound.
Analerttosellistriggeredwhenthemarketisoverbought,andwhenthemarketisoversold,
traders should be prepared to buy. This does not mean that one should rush to buy when the
market shows the first sign of being in an oversold condition, or to sell when the market is
overbought. The reason is simple. When a market enters initially into either overbought or
oversold conditions, it may continue to remain in such conditions for some time. The market
can even become more overbought or more oversold before making a definitive reversal.
Therefore, it is necessary to keep an eye on the weakening of price when in overbought
condition, and the strengthening of price when in oversold condition. When the oscillator
breaksoutfromitsoverboughtoroversoldlevels,itisimportanttoensurethatthebreakoutof
the oscillator corresponds with the directional movement of the price. This will help traders
avoid getting caught in a false breakout of the oscillator. Sometimes, the oscillator attempts to
break out early from its overbought or oversold levels, only to reverse immediately to its
formerlevels.
When using more than one oscillator, it is important to make sure that the parameters of
each oscillator are different. A common error is to unknowingly plot various oscillators on the
same chart with the same parameters, particularly the use of closing price for all oscillators.
This is tantamount to multiple counting of the same information. As a result, the readings

MOMENTUM OSCILLATOR
Momentum is perhaps one of the easier oscillators to understand. It measures the speed of
price changes. The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defines momentum as “the
force gained by the movement or development of events.” In technical analysis, momentum is
atechniqueofcomparingpricesatdifferenttimes.
A price rise, or a price decline, from one day to the next day, is described as a one-day
momentum.Thatis,today’smomentumistoday’scloseminusyesterday’sclose.
A 10-day momentum means the comparison of today’s price to the price 10 days ago: Price
[today] lessPrice [previous10-day].Iftoday’spriceisgreaterthantheprice10daysago,itwill
be a positive momentum, and if today’s price is less than the price 10 days ago, it will be a
negativemomentum.Momentumisalsoknownastherateofchangeofprice.
Momentum oscillators include popular classics like Appel’s MACD Histogram, Stochastic,
Wilder’s Relative Strength Index, and Williams %R. Momentum is useful in identifying early
trenddirection.Momentumhasonepowerfultrait;ittrackshowfastthepricetrendismoving,
and gains or losses of speed. Unfortunately, momentum is sometimes not easy to identify
becausepriceandmomentumdonotalwaysmoveintandem.
If the price increases on a rally, the momentum becomes positive and rises with the price.
However, when the price gets closer to its imminent peak or goes into a bracket market, the
continuing rally in price will slow down its speed, which will then cause a change in the
direction of the momentum. Momentum direction will decline instead. From this, we can make
two simple and powerful observations: (1) momentum’s trend will not always be in the
direction of the price trend; and (2) momentum’s oscillators do not represent price trends.
From these two observations, it can be surmised that reversal of momentum will not
necessarilycoincidewithapricereversal.
Momentum oscillator is useful in depicting divergence of trend slope between the price and
the oscillator. A bearish divergence occurs when the oscillator is making new lows while prices
are making new highs, and a bullish divergence occurs when the oscillator is making new highs
whilepricesaremakingnewlows.
Figure6.3
showsthebehaviorbetweenthemovementsofmomentumandprice.E1andG1showthat
momentum trend does not reflect price trend. Momentum trend will not always be in the
direction of the price trend. E1 shows a diagonal triangle in price while momentum is in a
horizontal range. G1 shows price declining in a downward channel while momentum was
declining in a parabolic arc. G1 also illustrates that we can draw a trend line to price as well as
in momentum. D1 and H1 show bullish divergences between momentum and price, and F1, J1,
and K1 show bearish divergences. F1 is also known as a hidden bearish divergence, and such
divergences are not often noticeable. Momentum also develops pattern formations; examples
ofdoubletopsanddoublebottomsareindicatedbythecirclesin

Conversely, if momentum reaches a very low value area, L1 (compared with its historical

always reflect price trend. Momentum direction will not always be in the direction of the price
trend.

Momentum oscillators are often plotted with two lines: the raw data line (or, the fast line),
and its moving average. There are three methods of calling entry and exit signals using the
momentum oscillator: (1) zone crossing, or crossing of the oversold or overbought lines; (2)

QUEUING THEORY OF MOVING AVERAGE
CROSSOVERS (QMAC)
The moving average has remained the most powerful method for analyzing and trading the
market. Moving averages canbeappliedtoawiderangeofuses,fromidentifying market trend
in any time frame, to detecting overbought or oversold conditions. They are easy to use and
form the basis of many trend trading systems. There are numerous ways of calculating moving
average mathematically: simple, exponential, weighted, time series, volume adjusted, and so
forth. Over the years, many new innovative ideas have been added. The basic idea is to
smoothenshort-termpricefluctuationstohaveabetterpictureofthemaintrend.
Theperiodscommonlyusedforplottingmovingaveragelinesrangefrom2daysto250days.
In this book, moving averages are categorized under three groups. The first group is the short-
term period from 2 days to 9 days, the second group is the mid-term period 9 days to 34 days,
and the third group is the 50-day to 250-day group. When a market is in a strong trend, prices
will cross above all the averages of these three groups, and moving averages lines from each of
thethreegroupswillalsofollowsuit.Thatis,theshorterperiodwillalsocrossabovethelonger
period.Andtheorderofalignmentisreversedwhenthemarketisveryweak.Whenthemarket
moves to an extreme level, whether bullish or bearish, prices will lead the directional change,
and will be followed by the various moving averages. This is the first observation of the
Queuing Theory of Moving Average Crossovers (QMAC). That is, when prices make a bullish or
bearish directional change, its relative moving averages should also follow suit and be in a
sequential order.Theshorter periodmoving averages willalsocrossaboveorbelowtheslower
period averages. If the price and its moving averages are not aligned in a sequential order, the
respective rally or retracement most probably will be short-lived and prices can be expected to
continue to move in their previous direction or to make further consolidation. For practical
purposes and ease of usage, three moving averages, the 50-day, 90-day, and 200-day, are
illustrated below as examples of the application of QMAC. It also shows the relationships of
price and moving average crossovers, crossovers between two moving averages, and the
relationshipofpriceandtwomovingaverages.
The most popular method of interpreting a moving average is to compare the relationship
and crossovers between a price and its moving average to determine current trend direction
and to anticipate its most likely future direction. Moving averages, though used as a smoothing
technique, also filter out the fluctuations of short-term volatility in price movement. There is,
however, one deficiency in that most moving averages are lagging technical indicators, which
meanstheytendtotrailbehindthecurrentpriceinfast-movingmarkets.(See
Figure6.6
.) All moving averages have this weakness—the lag effect. Thus, in a highly volatile or non-
trending market, trading signals using moving averages tend to generate faulty signals. This will
causerepeatedwhipsaws,whichcanpileuptradinglosses.

A sell signal is generated when the share price falls below the moving average, and a buy
signal is generated when the share price rises above its moving average. The critical element in
a moving average is the time period used in calculating the average. The objective of a moving
average system is to pick a trade with a probable price trend by buying shortly after the share
pricebottomsandsellingafterittops.
Another method is the use of multiple moving averages. For example, in a system with two
moving average lines, a buy is signaled when the shorter moving average crosses above the
longer moving average, and a sell is signaled when the shorter line crosses below the longer
line. The shorter the length of a moving average, the more sensitive it will be to short-term
fluctuations, and the longer the length, the less sensitive to abrupt fluctuations. Shorter-length
averageslagthemarketlessthanlonger-lengthaverages
A study in moving average will not be complete without the study of the eight principles
regarding the interpretation of price to moving average. The rules are mentioned in Technical
Analysis of Stock Trends by Robert D. Edwards and John Magee. The Eight Rules of Moving
Average Crossovers (Eight Rules) refer to movements between price and its 200-day moving
average. The 200-day moving average is generally accepted as the key psychology line used by
manylong-terminvestors.
TheEightRulescanbeappliedtoalmostanyperiodofmovingaverage.

8. If the stock price rises too fast above the rising 200-day average line, a short-term reaction
maybeexpected.
Figure6.7
shows the application of the Eight Rules on the crossovers between an 8-day moving
average and a 34-day moving average as well as the plot of a momentum oscillator between
the two moving averages. When the 8-day moving average crosses above the 34-day average,
theoscillatorwillbeabovethezeroline.

differenceofthetwomovingaverages.
Referring tothe Eight Rules, ifanother moving average isplotted between price and200-day
average, say a 50-day average, there will be two moving average crossovers, a 50-day average
anda200-dayaverage.
The interplay of these two moving averages, 50-day and 200-day, is popularly used in
considering prospective bull and bear markets. When the 50-day is above the 200-day, the
market is considered to be in a long-term bull phase, and when the 50-day is below the 200-
day, the market is considered to be in a long-term bear phase. When the 50-day crosses from
below to above the 200-day, it is referred as the Golden Cross, signaling a market change to a
bullishoutlook,andwhenthe50-daycrossesfromabovetobelowthe200-day,itisreferredas
theDeadCross,signalingamarketchangetoabearishoutlook.
Generally, the combination of two moving averages is effective as well as easy to interpret.
Thefasterlinetrackstheshorter-termtrend,whiletheslowerlinetracksthelonger-termtrend.
When there is a crossing between the faster line and the slower line, it indicates a probable
change in trend. This method of crossover is commonly used in developing automated setup
conditions, and in a rule-based trading system, which will be discussed in later chapters of the
book. However, this system alone is subject to whipsaws in a bracket market condition and
shouldbesupportedbyasubsequententryconditionorbyanothersupportingoscillator.
Inacrossover systemoftwomoving averages, wehavethreefactors: theprice, ashort-term
moving average, and a long-term moving average. Let’s take the price as the closing price, the



==================================================
                     PAGE 128                     
==================================================

short-term moving average as 50-day, and the long-term moving average as 200-day. In a
bullish trend, the alignment of these three factors (from top to bottom) will be: price, 50-day,
and200-day;thepricewillbeaboveits50-daylineandthebottomlinewillbethe200-day.Ina
bearish trend, the order is reversed, with the 200-day at the top and the price at the bottom.
When the price is between the 50-day and the 200-day, the interpretation becomes less
obvious. Under such conditions and subject to other supporting technical analysis, we may
wanttostayonthesidelineuntilthesituationimproves,unlessanautomatedtradingsystemis
beingused.
What is being described so far refers to the application of 50-day and 200-day moving
averages in adaily chart. If it isaweekly chart, the time frames for the averages will have to be
changed to 10-week moving average (equivalent to 50-day moving average) and 40-week

Basedonthescenarioshownin

medium-term (90-day) averages, and the 50-day crosses below the 90-day. The setup for a

or moving in a flat, while in a bearish crossover, the longer average line should be moving
downward or in a flat direction. The setup position is vulnerable to false breaks when prices go
into a consolidation phase. When the 50-day is below the 90-day, and the 90-day is above the
200-day, it confirms continuing downward trend of price; and, vice versa, when the 50-day is
above 90-day and 90-day is below 200-day, it confirms the continuing upward trend of price.
Theadvantageofusingathreemovingaveragesystemisthatitprovidesawiderperspectiveof
market directional movements. For example, when the longer-term moving averages are not in
a queue of bullish alignment, any rally signals by the crossovers of shorter-term moving
averageswillbeshort-lived.
The preceding are examples of how to read the probable trend of the market in the
relationship of movements in different moving averages. It is possible to add more averages to
the combination, which gives even more possibilities of movements, and these can be split up
intosetsoflong-termandshort-termmovingaverages.Thesetoflong-termaverageswillserve

There are many ways of using moving averages to trade. Using crossovers of averages to
trade may be the easiest mechanical system, but the method can baffle traders because the
effect from a set of moving averages crossovers does not apply consistently to price behavioral
patterns. This appears to be more discernible in the application of longer time frame
averages—forexample,thecrossoversof50-dayand200-daymovingaverages.

2 is a common pattern of moving average crossovers inside a contracting triangle. The index
broke slightly below the 200-day on January 28, 2010, at about point “d” toward the end of a
contractingtriangle(markedasa,b,c,d,ande),andmanagedtoclingfastandvacillatearound
its 200-day average. On March 23, 2010, the bearish sign appeared: the 50-day average dipped
below the 200-day average. But instead of declining, the index made further advances until
April 19, when support finally yielded to selling pressure. The advance by the index following
the bearish crossing of the 50-day and 200-day averages was a false move. The three longer-
term averages, 50-day, 90-day, and 200-day, were not aligned in a sequential order.
Incidentally, the sharp drop on April 19 also saw the beginning of the destruction of the
consolidation pattern, a pattern formed by the contracting triangle when the index finally went
belowthemirrortrendlineofTL1towardthemirrorlineofTL2-1.
Point 1 and Point 3 are good examples of how price reactions can be contradictory when the
50-day average crosses above the 200-day average. In the first example, at Point 1, the index
went above the 200-day average on March 23, 2009, for the first time after a long decline of
approximately 14 months. And at X1 on April 9, 2009, the 50-day average pushed above the
200-day average, paving the way for the index to make a small bullish run to early August. In
the second example, at Point 3, the index crossed above the 200-day average on October 12,
2010afterasix-monthdecline.AndatX2onNovember10,the50-dayaveragemadeacrossing

assumption that a bullish run would follow as in the first example, the result would have been

nofollow-upbullishrun.
What exactly happened? At Point 1 on March 23, 2009, and at Point 3 on October 12, 2010,
the index crossed above the 200-day average, which was followed by the 50-day average
crossing above the 200-day average on April 9, 2009 (X1) and November 10, 2010 (X2),
respectively. In the first example, the 50-day crossover generated a small bullish trend, but in
the second example the 50-day crossover did not generate any bullish follow-up trend. The
difference in the effect of the two crossing is in the strength of the index’s trend at the time of
crossing. When the 50-day average crossed the 200-day at X1, the index broke out of a bullish
reversal pattern, but at X2, the index was entering into a bearish diagonal pattern. Thus, at X1,
the strength of the trend is stronger than at X2. At X2, the index is subject to heavy resistance
as it has reached the center of a saturated area of resistance, the contracting triangle (a-b-c-d-
e). It has retraced over 61.8 percent of the decline from P to Q and 100 percent of the recent
decline from “e” to Q, and at X2 its strength has weakened. This is noticeable by the negative
divergence between the 200-day price oscillator and the index. Such divergence is often
overlookedbynovicetraders.
Rule1andRule5oftheEightRulesontheInterpretationofPricetoMovingAveragescanbe
applied to moving average crossovers between a shorter-term and a longer-term average. For
easy reference, we have repeated the two rules below and substitute the word “price” with
“50-dayaverage”intherules.
Rule 1: If the 200-day average line flattens out or advances following a decline, and the 50-day
average penetrates that 200-day average line on the upside, this constitutes a major buying
signal.
Rule 5: If the 200-day average line flattens out or declines following a rise, and the 50-day
average penetrates that 200-day average line on the downside, this constitutes a major selling
signal.
Another significant and finer reason for the difference in the resulting effects on the

==================================================

crossover between the 50-day and 200-day averages at Point 1 and at Point 3 is stated in the
two rules. The rules refer to the slope and directional movement of the longer-term moving
average, the 200-day average. In other words, when the 50-day average crosses with the 200-
day average, it is important to note the direction and slope of the 200-day average also. In the
first example at Point 1, the 200-day average is rounder and flatter and subsequently moved in
the same direction of the 50-day average. In the second example at Point 3, the 200-day
average has a steeper and straighter decline, which reduces the strength of the crossing. Thus,
instead of trading at just any crossovers, trades can be implemented when the longer-term
average levels out and when the shorter-term average diverges and moves farther away from
thelonger-termaverage.Inthisrespect,perhapsabuffercouldbeaddedtoavoidwhipsaws.
Atrendlineisastraightlineconnectingaminimumoftwopoints.In
Figure6.14
, two trend lines, TL1 and TL2, are shown. The more points a trend line connects, the more
reliable it is. TL1 is the trend line connecting the low in late October/early November 2009 and
the low in early July 2010, which forms the major support line. The trend line above TL1, the
mirror line, is parallel to TL1. The two lines, TL1 and its parallel line, form the upward trend
channel. TL2 is the downward trend line connecting the various high points, and with its mirror
line, forms the downward trend channel. The market is deemed bullish if prices are above the

MACD
Moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD, was developed by Gerald Appel. It is a
popular momentum indicator that shows the relationship between moving averages of prices.
It has two plotted lines. The standard configuration for MACD, the first plotted line, is the
difference between 12-day and 26-day exponential moving average lines. The second line, also
knownasthesignalline,isa9-dayexponentialmovingaverageofthefirstline.

The buy and sell signals used in MACD are similar to those used in crossovers of moving
average lines. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, a buy signal is triggered.
Conversely, when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, a sell signal is generated. When
MACD and its signal lines are above the zero line, it indicates bullishness in the market, and
when they are below the zero line, it indicates a bearish market. An indication that an end to
the current trend may be near occurs when the MACD diverges from the security. A bearish
divergence occurs when the MACD is making new lows while prices fail to reach new lows. A
bullish divergence occurs when the MACD is making new highs while prices fail to reach new
highs.ThisMACDdivergenceisdifferentfromanMACDHistogramdivergence.
MACD Histogram is the difference between MACD and its signal line, and it is worthwhile to
spend more time in getting to know the indicator. Dr. Alexander Elder, in his book, Trading for
a Living, published in 1993, had this to say about MACD Histogram. “MACD Histogram offers a
deeper insight into the balance of power between bulls and bears than the original MACD. It
shows not only whether bulls or bears are in control, but also whether they are growing
stronger or weaker. It is one of the best tools available to a market technician.” Divergences
between MACD Histogram and prices give some of the most reliable messages in identifying

AVERAGE DIRECTION INDEX
Average Direction Index (ADX) is a valuable indicator that is widely used by analysts to identify
whether a trend exists, and to quantify trend strength. ADX was developed by J. Welles Wilder
Jr., and published in his 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. We shall not
get down to the nitty-gritty calculations of ADX; it is available in all technical analysis software
programs.
ADX was developed as part of a direction movement indicator, which is generally plotted
togetherastworelateddirectionalmovementlines,thepositivedirectionalmovementlineand
thenegativedirectionalmovementline.
ADX is an oscillator that fluctuates between 0 and 100. ADX’s value, with a standard 14-day
setting, seldom exceeds 60 or falls below 10. ADX is plotted as a single line and is not a
directional indicator. As a rule of thumb, when ADX crosses above 20 from below, it suggests
that the price trend is getting stronger. On the other hand, when ADX crosses from above to
below 20, price trend strength is getting weaker and is entering into a non-trending market.
Thus,ahighADXvaluecanindicateastrongdowntrendaswellasastronguptrend.
Higher ADX value represents a stronger price trend, while lower ADX value represents a
weaker price trend. Thus, a rising value of ADX reflects a strong trend is in progress, a declining
ADXvaluereflectsaweakeningtrend,andaflatADXreflectsanabsenceoftrend.Asaresultof
its behavioral patterns in revealing trending and non-trending conditions of the market, a
trader can use ADX to form a trading strategy. However, ADX has its limitations. It lags price
movements and should not be used as a buy or sell signal. It takes approximately 30 bars to
establishthevalueoftheADXwitha14-dayperiod.
Havingsaidthat,thevalueofADXisthatitconfirmsthetrendstrengthandnotitsdirectional
movement. We would like to add that the directional movement of ADX is also important and
should be carefully observed. When the ADX moves up, it reaches its high and makes a
subsequent downward turn. This pattern is very important. The turning of direction in the ADX
impliesthatthereisgoingtobeachangeoftrendstrength.Whenthereisachangeinthetrend
strength, it implies that there will probably also be a change in the price trend and direction
soon.
Thus, when prices have been trending downward and the ADX, moving in the opposite
direction to price, rises to reach its extreme high level and then makes a turn downward, we
should be on the lookout for a change in price trend shortly. On the other hand, when price is
falling rapidly, and the ADX rises to reach its high to make a downward turn, it indicates the
price trend will be improving soon. A steep slope of ADX movement shows strength while a
slopethatisalmostflatindicatesweakness.
Directional movements often hide the true message of ADX and run contrary to price
movements,asshownin

of whether the price is high or low. When ADX crosses above the alert line, it warns of a
probable change of price trend. At Point 3, price is meeting resistance at the 200-day average
line, and ADX is turning down and crosses below the alert line, which confirms weakening of
price. At Point 4, the 50-day average crosses above the 90-day line from below. This is a bullish
sign that is supported by the fact that price is holding well at the 90-day level and by the
subsequentchangeinADX’sdirectionfromitshighasitcrossesbelowthealertline.

CONCLUSION
This chapter discusses five key indicators: momentum, moving averages, MACD, ADX, and
protective stops, which will help traders to understand the purpose and use of indicators in a
trading strategy. In planning a chart layout, traders should ensure that the layout covers
different aspects of the market. A good layout should not be cluttered with indicators but
should be neat and simple. Yet it should be meaningful and complete. Basically, the chart will
have a trend indicator to show the probable direction of the trend, a momentum indicator to
measure the speed at which price is changing, and a volume indicator to measure stock
activities. Traders should avoid using multiple indicators that show the same type of
informationinthechart.
Momentum measures the speed of price change and is used in identifying price strength by
the variance of the change in speed of price. It is the basic concept applied in most indicators.
MACD is also a momentum indicator. It consists of three plots. The first MACD line is derived
from the difference of two different periods of exponential moving averages. Standard
parameters are a 12-day period and a 26-day period. The second line, the signal line, is a 9-day
exponential moving average of the first line. The third line is plotted as a histogram. The
histogram is the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. The slopes of the
histogram will often diverge with the price directional movement to alert traders to probable
turning points in trend. A trader must take note that, when using momentum oscillators, the
trend of the momentum does not always represent the price trend. Momentum oscillators are
useful in identifying overbought and oversold conditions of the market. Overbought conditions
reflect the underlying strength of the market, and oversold conditions reflect the weakening of
the market. As a timing tool for buying and selling, momentum provides more reliable signals
when traders use two different time frame momentums, daily momentum and weekly
momentum. The objective is to trade when the daily time frame is in the direction of the
weeklytimeframe,unlessthemomentumisoverboughtoroversold.
In the chapter, two methods of using moving averages have been described. The first is the
popular method of using the crossing of price and its moving average as trading signals for
trade entries and exits, which can also be applied to reading crossings of two different moving
averages. The second method is a new concept, the Queuing Theory of Moving Average
Crossovers. The theory is based on the assumption that when there is a trend, the price and its
relative moving averages should move in a sequential order of alignment. In a bullish trend,
price will lead and be above the shorter moving average, which will be followed by the longer
movingaverage.Inabearishmarket,pricewillalsoleadthedecliningtrend,butitwillbebelow
the shorter moving average, which will be below the longer moving average. Any change in
sequential order of alignment of the price and its moving averages will indicate a weakening of
the prevailing trend. A price rally or a price retracement that occurs when there is a disorderly
alignment can be expected to be short-lived. The application of the theory will help traders to
assess the probable risk and reward before making trade decisions, to determine trading time
frames,andtoformabetterperspectiveofthemarket.
Two optional indicators have also been included in the chapter, ADX and protective stops.
ADX is used to identify whether a trend exists and to quantify the strength of the trend. The
common practice is to determine a benchmark that serves to identify the trend; the higher the
value of ADX, the stronger the trend, irrespective of whether the trend is up or down. Traders

There is not going to be any disagreement when it is said that the market is complex and
chaotic. Sometimes the market rises dramatically and sometimes it falls drastically. A rising
marketisfollowedbyadecliningmarketthatisagainfollowedbyarisingmarket,andthecycle
repeats again and again. But these cycles do not happen or repeat in uniformity. There is no
reliablewaytopredictpreciselywhenthenextdirectionofthecyclewilltakeplaceorhowlong
it will last. Prediction of a longer-term cycle is made even more difficult by movements of
smaller cycles. Elliott Wave practitioners believe these cycles are the result of psychological
reactions of market players. Economists maintain that all these movements and cyclical
patterns are caused by economic factors. Financial astrologists believe these cycles are
influenced by various planetary movements. Yet, in its chaotic behavior, the market seems to

With today’s developed technologies and high-speed computers, more and more equity
funds are turning to programmed system trading using superfast computers to catch the trend

Having a trading system helps to alleviate fear and tension, reducing the burden of
discretionary decisions and the anticipation of price reversals or breakouts. A good trend
system is one that generates reliable trend signals most of the time. It will help us to respond
quicklytopriceactions.
The trading method introduced in this chapter is not a fully automated trading system. It is a
discretionary trend system. The method’s core system is based on crossovers of price and
various moving averages and the synchronization of moving average crossovers to reflect
trends in progress and probable change in trend. The trading method includes two additional
indicators:avolumeindicatorforadditionalconfirmationoftrendbreakouts,andamomentum

CATCHING THAT TREND
Catchingthetrend,whetheritisanuptrendoradowntrend,isthekeytoprofitsbecause,ifwe
can catch it, half of our work is completed. However, understanding the forces at work in
trending and non-trending markets, and the transition from one phase to the other phase, is
the most difficult task. An uptrend means a series of higher highs and higher lows. Each high is
followedbyahigherhighandeachlowisfollowedbyahigherlow.Adowntrendmeansaseries
of lower highs and lower lows. Each high is followed by a lower high and each low is followed
by a lower low. Defining whether a trend exists will be subject to the trading time frame of the
trader. For instance, let’s assume a scenario in which a stock closes at its high of $10 with an
openingof$10,andthatitslowforthedayis$9.Thetradingtimeisfourhours.Withthestock
opening and closing at $10, it would appear that there is no trend for the day. However, if we
look at the minute chart, there will be a downward trend and an upward trend in a period of
four hours’ trading time. At the opening bell, sellers push the price downward to $9, the low of
the day, where it finds support from buyers, who push the price upward to close at the high to
form a dragonfly doji bar. This example is an illustration of intraday trends and it exemplifies
thattrendisvalidonlyfortherelativetimeframeinwhichitoccurs.

well-defined trend to a period of congestion, and then from a period of congestion back to a
well-defined trend. Each phase of movement between a well-defined trend and the congestion
period provides clues to the traders for the next phase. At times, the clues are obvious, and at
times they are hidden from our naked eyes, making it harder to see the next directional
movementfromtheevolvingpatterns,whicharegenerallyformedatperiodsofcongestion.
When the market is not trending, continually making new highs or new lows, and when the
spreads between highs and lows are narrow, there is no margin of profit to be made if slippage
and commission are taken into account. In such non-trending or sideways markets, moving
averages are often relatively flat and price movements may fluctuate between two points in a
relatively horizontal movement that can last for a long period of weeks to months. A sideways
market usually occurs at a price support level where accumulation takes place, or at a price
resistance level where distribution takes place. Such price patterns take place when buyers and
sellers are more or less in balance, with neither side in control. Trading becomes difficult and
thebestthingtodoissitbackandwaitforthedevelopmentofthenexttrendingphase.
Irrespective of the different types of price formations, the most important rule in market
trading is to never commit any trade against the trend. If the trend of the stock price is headed
downward, then it isnot safe to buy that stock until the trend haschanged direction. However,
many ambitious traders still habitually trade against the trend in an attempt to get in at the
exact bottom of the market or get out at the exact top of the market. This is too high a risk to
take and the extra dollar is not worth the loss that will eventually squeeze the trader out of
subsequent price movements. Whatever may be said, the habit is still common among traders,
and there is a price to pay for being ambitious. Using a trade system is helpful. A trade should
only be made when there is a signal from the trading system that the trend has changed
direction. In other words, act in accordance with what has happened and do not act in
anticipation ofwhatwillhappen.Perhapstherewillbelossesforafewpointsbut,ontheother
hand, catching 80 percent of every trend movement will greatly improve trading results in the
long run. And as for the balance 20 percent, it is better left for lucky traders and ambitious
daydreamers. In the systems and various indicators introduced in this book, intraday data are
ignored. We will not be dealing with minute charts or hourly charts. We will be using end-of-

BUILT-IN COLOR TREND INDICATOR
Acting on the trend means we should be a buyer when the trend is up and a seller when the
trend is down. Most of us, when we are trading, hope to identify the trend early and benefit to
the full extent of the trend by employing various mathematical tools. There have been many
trend systems developed but one of the easiest market tools to identify trend is moving
averages. In a strong trending market, moving averages work very well. It is during the non-
trendingmarketthatmovingaveragesystemsfalter.

The concept of the BIC trend indicator is based on the intersecting crossovers of three
moving averages. These three moving averages form a set of short-term moving averages
consisting of two 5-day moving averages and a 13-day moving average. The purpose of the BIC
trend indicator is to signal when there is a probable correction of price movements by
displaying neutral-colored (black or dark red) candlesticks. When such color signals occur, the
indicator is telling that the continuing trend is facing resistance. However, such signals are not
to be used as an entry or exit signal system. We have to double-check with the corresponding
price patterns and the signals from other supporting indicators, such as momentum and
volumeindicators,forconfirmation.
Weekly charts are used to recognize the market structure and to identify the trend that is in
progress. They are used as preparatory trade positioning prior to using the daily charts for the
execution of trade entries and exits. In short, a trader should first refer to the weekly charts to
identify probable market structure and trend, and second, use the daily charts for timing of
execution of trades. The rule is to trade in the trending direction of the next higher time frame
of the daily price, that is, weekly. The objective is to trade when the daily and weekly are
trending in tandem. Weekly charts will simplify the reading of trend; they clear away a lot of
noise inherent in short-term fluctuations while providing meaningful clues with respect to
potentiallonger-termtrendperspective.

SUPPORTING MOVING AVERAGES
Continuing with the example of the weekly chart, we shall enhance it with further supporting
indicators, including two additional sets of moving averages and a volume indicator, as shown
in

Beforegoingintoreading
Figure7.2
, traders need to know how the weekly chart is constructed in the system. Each bar of the
weekly chart represents the price range of the trading days of that week. If the week has three
trading days, the bar represents the range of the three days. The opening price of the weekly
baristheopeningpriceofthefirsttradingdayintheweek,theclosingpriceistheclosingprice
of the last trading day of the week, the high represents the highest price of the week, and the
lowrepresentsthelowestpriceoftheweek.
Thus, each weekly bar is a summary of the trading days of the week, from Monday to Friday,
and trying to find which day in the coming week will be the best day to buy or sell would be
difficult. Weekly bars may often be very volatile, and for those who do their trading based on
signals generated by weekly charts, it is important to have the ability to stay with the longer-
term trend and patiently sit through the volatile period. Price dictates all movements of trend,
and there is no one system that is able to predict precisely and constantly where the price will
be heading in the next period. Thus, the system recommends traders use weekly charts as
treasuremaps,andasameansofgettingontherightpath.

fast average in red (RMA) and a slow average in black (BMA). The second pair of average lines
shows the longer-term averages, consisting of the 21-week moving average and the 63-week
moving average. The lower panel is the percentage ratio indicator of 2-week volume moving
average to 10-week volume moving average. There are also two horizontal lines, a 100 percent
line and a 150 percent line. If we assume the 2-week average volume is 110 percent, which is
above the 100 percent line, it means the 2-week average volume is greater than the 10-week
average volume by 10 percent. When the 2-week average volume is above 150 percent, it
means the 2-week average volume is greater than the 10-week volume by at least 50 percent.
This is an extreme level, which functions similarly to the overbought/oversold concept. When
the 2-week volume average goes beyond 150 percent, it is justifiable to take a second look at
thechart,becausesomethinginterestingmaybebrewing.

with the upward trend went above 150 percent for the first time since the decline, and at B4,
bothBMAandRMAcrossedabovethe63-weekaverage,indicatingabulltrendwasinprogress.
Though at B4 there was one bearish bar, it did not penetrate below the 63-week line. The 21-
week line and BMA average showed the strong support of buyers at this price level. B5
witnessedthecrossingofthe21-weeklinefrombelowtoabovethe63-weekline,whilethe63-
week line was moving in a flat direction. This was the third positive area. Note also another
macrobullishcup-and-handlepatternwasbeingformed.
Prices went into a 14-week consolidation and broke the high of $1.42 and the resistance line
on October 23, 2009, supported the following week by a powerful thrust with significant
volume going above the 150 percent line. Interestingly, in hindsight, it proves the greatest
amount of volume generally occurs at the halfway mark of the trend (see V3). Cross-checking
with MetaStock Fibonacci Retracement plots will also show the retracement is at about the 50
percentlevel,wherethehighvolumeisconcentrated.
Pricescontinued torallybutvolumewasnotsupportive. Volumewasmoving intheopposite
direction. It was decreasing. Price reached the peak of $3.37 for the week, which showed a
bearish spinning top pattern candlestick, representing an indecisive tussle between the bulls
and bears, and engulfing the previous week’s bar. The following bars turned to dark red,
indicating a likely change in trend as in B6. However, the RMA did not cross below the BMA.
Prices renewed the rally but failed to hold on to the gain and declined again at B7. Note that
the bar color changed to dark red, RMA and BMA merged, and prices crossed below both
averages. This was the first negative area after the bullish rally. Prices tried to regain their
thrust, as in B8, but failed again as bars turned red and RMA crossed below BMA. This was the
second negative area. At B9, prices fell below both the RMA and BMA and the 21-week line.
The bears had taken control. This was the third negative area. Note that volume was increasing
quietly as at V4 in the negative areas, and at the two similar bearish patterns of dark cloud
covercandlesticks,asmarkedat(1)and(2).
At V5, an alert was sounded when volume went above 150 percent and the two average
lines, RMA and BMA, converged, indicating a probable trend reversal. At point (3), a bullish
piercing candlestick was formed. The bullishness was confirmed by the following week’s dark
red candlestick as price crossed above RMA, BMA, the 21-week line, and the 63-week line.
Bullish sentiment continued with upsurge of volume as at V6, and prices held firmly above all
averages, indicated by blue candlesticks. This was the first positive area after the zigzag
correction.
In the preceding paragraphs, we have detailed the trend system using moving averages
covering a bullish impulse trend, bullish and bearish reversals, and an A-B-C correction.
Although the chart showed a positive indication of a probable new trend in the making, as at
the last bar of the weekly chart, it should not be presumed that such trend will rally to a new
high.

TRADE ON DAILYSIGNALS
There is no question that spotting the beginning and end of a profitable trend, and the staying
with the trend during its course, is the most difficult task. A trend can be disrupted by many
other trends of different time periods because each time frame attracts different groups of
interacting players. This results in convergence and divergence of the trend through different
timeperiods.
Trends of very short time periods will be difficult to trade. In order to improve their
performance, successful traders adjust their trading time frame to match their preferred
holding period. The purpose is to separate the trend for the specific trading time frame from
disrupting noises as much as possible. Risk is defined as the amount of money that a trader is
willing to risk, and reward is the anticipated return multiple of the risk. It means if a trader is
prepared to take alossof$1 onhistrade, it would beworth the risk to expect areturn of$3. If
a risk of $1 is assumed to be a loss of 10 percent, the projected reward should assume to fetch
a return of 30 percent. The 3:1 reward to risk ratio is a good ratio to use particularly for Hong
Kongstocks, whichtendtogointoconsolidation afterariseof30percent. However, theriskto
reward ratio is subject to the personal decision of each trader. Trading time frame analysis of
setup position will identify opportunity and risk in most cases. For example, when a promising
setup appears on the weekly chart, a trader should check it to identify the major support and
resistancelevelsthatmayhaveanimpactonthe3:1rewardtoriskratio,andthenusethedaily

added as the reward to risk ratio was about 1:3; that is to say for every 10 cents to be gained
there is a probable risk of 30 cents loss. Also the weekly momentum trend remained weak and
the two weekly moving averages, RMA and BMA, were converging, which did not seem to
support the daily price rally. And on March 26, the last position of one lot was sold at the

offering a 3:1 reward to risk ratio. The downward trend continued till March 9 when prices
made a significant thrust above the RMA and BMA lines, supported by the positive movement
of the momentum oscillator. Prices went into a trading range for one week. On September 17,
the uptrend movement was confirmed when both daily and weekly charts turned positive. A
buy order for two lots was entered on the next trading day, September 20, 2010, at $2.45,
which saw a breakaway gap. A protective stop would have been set at $2.35, being the low of
theprecedingbar.OnOctober14,pricespikeduptocloseattheday’shighof$2.57.
The preceding describes a detailed scenario of a trading system that applies the concept of
using crossovers between price and its averages and the crossovers of different time spans of
moving averages in weekly and daily charts. The use of weekly charts is mainly to filter out
noise created by daily prices, and also to avoid overtrading. The strategy is to trade in the
direction of the larger time frame (the weekly trend) and to execute the trade based on the
smallertimeframe(thedailytrend).

trend of price movement. Generally, moving averages are used (1) as a forecast value for the

From the weekly chart, it is interesting to note that price momentum has reached its
oversold zone level on three occasions: October 31, 2008, December 24, 2009, and February
25,2011.Thereisaperiodofapproximately60weeksbetweeneachlow.Andtheweekending
February 25, 2011, is approximately 90 weeks from the high of June 5, 2009. From the low of
December 24, 2009, to October 22, 2010, prices managed to hold at approximately 50 percent
to 61.8 percent of the Fibonacci Retracement support zone, as momentum moved upward to
overbought zone. This reflects the improvement of the strength in price. After making a double
top, momentum fell as prices failed to hold above the support levels and reached an oversold
position with a low of $5.57 at week ending February 25, 2011. The oversold position provides

TRADING WITH ICHIMOKU
The concept of the trading method and Queuing Theory can also be applied to Ichimoku
charting technique. The complete Ichimoku indicator comprises five lines, Tenkan-sen, Kijun-
sen,SenkouspanA,SenkouspanB,andChikouspan.In
Figure7.7
, Chikou span is not plotted. Chikou span is the closing price of the current candlestick, plotted
backwardbytheperiodoftheKijun-sen.

Figure7.7
isanillustration ofhow the principles ofthe trading method described in this book can also
be applied to various indicators. As an example, the chart uses the popular indicators such as
Ichimokuindicator,volume,andRSI(relativestrengthindex).
ThepopularIchimokuCloud,shownin
Figure7.7
, is the filled space between the faster line, Senkou span A, and the slower line, Senkou span
B. The Ichimoku Cloud often acts as the equilibrium zone of price movements, and it marks an
area of support and resistance. When price moves above the cloud, it is said it has broken out
oftheresistancearea,andwhenpricemovesbelowthecloud,ithasfallenfromthesupporting
area.Whenpricesaretradingorfluctuatingintheareaofthecloud,itnormallyindicatesatug-
of-war between sellers and buyers in a trading range, where price movements can sometimes
become unpredictable. Ichimoku Cloud can vary in depth and thickness. A thicker cloud
indicates higher past price volatility, and a thinner and shallower cloud indicates lower
volatility.
The Tenkan-sen is the faster line and the Kijun-sen is the slower line. An uptrend is triggered

When a trend is positive, the various Ichimoku lines, the Tenkan-sen, Kijun-sen, and the cloud
(formed by Senkou span A and Senkou span B) should also be in sequential order to price.
When any of these lines is not in sequence with the price, the trend in progress may be short-
lived.Whenpriceshavemovedtoanextreme level,achangeintrendisanticipated, asmarked
byPointsT2andT3in
Figure7.7
.
When price is making a change in trend, its movements are often hidden in pattern
formations such as divergence between the price and momentum oscillator, price and volume,
price spread and volume, and convergence and divergence of various moving averages.
Divergence that hints of an impending change does not necessarily take place at the exact
turningpoint,butmayhavebeeninthemakingweeksago.
Extreme levels of prices or proximity of extreme levels are often reflected in the divergence
betweenpriceandmomentumoscillator,asshowninPointsT1andT2of
Figure7.7
. Generally, momentum oscillators in an uptrend tend to rally quickly to overbought levels
before price makes its peak. And as momentum starts to slow down while price catches up, it
will create a divergence between the slope of price and oscillator. At T1, the momentum
oscillator rallies to its overbought level, and retraces gradually to T2, where price makes its
peak.
The importance of volume, covered in Chapter 5, cannot be ignored. Volume helps to
confirmthevalidityandthestrengthofthetrend.AtPointAof
Figure7.7

CONCLUSION
The aim of reading stock charts is to track trading opportunities by identifying price behavior,
which is based on recognition of past price patterns and price analysis, to anticipate the
probableoutcome.
The concept of the trading method described in this book is for end-of-day (EOD) traders,
and the method is centered on a trend-following concept. To reduce risks, the method
embodies as its main tenet the usage of two time frames to better gauge trade entries and
exits. Thecombination ofthe four dimensions related totrend, asdiscussed inearlier chapters,
will help traders to identify different market environments and to switch a trading strategy
from trending mode to mean reversal mode using the momentum oscillator and Queuing
Theory. The method will assist traders to differentiate between a market that is in a corrective
phase and one that is in an impulse phase and to anticipate areas of support and resistance
levels,sotheymayplantheirtradingstrategyaccordingly.

price movements of every stock. Every stock has its own characteristics, business activities and
prospects, earnings and dividend ratios, price movement patterns, groups of investors, and so
forth. However, there is one similarity in every trading system. That is, when a stock has a
strong trend, almost every trading system is good. Similarly, there is no one single oscillator

Every opportunity comes with a time element; time regulates opportunity. Many traders
habitually fail at time management. Many traders may sit on nonperforming stocks for months
and tie up their investment capital while good opportunities pass by, while other traders may
missmajorsupportandresistancethatappearsonthenexthighertimeframe.Inshort,traders
must acknowledge the importance of time and manage time as efficiently as price, combining
price and time triggers for protective stop-loss management. It may be justified to consider
using time to activate trade exits on nonperforming stocks even when price stops have not
been breached. And it may even be more justified to sell at the time of a bear crunch and to

In investments and trading, success requires three elements: money management, trading
methodology, and understanding of time. Time is the least understood. Time has great
influence on the market because when the time is up, trend changes. One common issue with
time is often seen in the accumulation or distribution of a stock. When such activity is over,
prices will break out of the accumulation pattern upward or break out of the distribution
pattern downward. Other issues with time include understanding time in trend continuation

CHAPTER8
FormulatingYourTradingPlan
In 1992, Jack Schwager published The New Market Wizards. The chapter titled “The Silence of
the Turtles” covers an interview with Harold Seidler, one of the many market wizards
mentioned in the book. In this interview, Jack asked Harold, “What advice would you give
someoneinregardstobeingsuccessfulinthemarkets?”Haroldreplied:“Ithinkthesinglemost
important element is having a plan. First, a plan forces discipline, which is an essential
ingredient to successful trading. Second, a plan gives you a benchmark against which you can
measureyourperformance.”
Trading is an exercise in well-planned strategy. It is said that to have good trading results, a
trader needs to spend 70 percent of his time in planning and only about 30 percent in trading.
Heformulatesaplanandfollowsitinafirmanddisciplinedway.
The ability to make decisions confidently in trading is to get rid of the fear factor. Fear arises
when there is uncertainty. Fear is a hindrance to making good decisions and having a trading

==================================================

DETERMINING YOUR TIME FRAME
First and foremost, ask yourself, “How much time will you have to trade?” This will determine
the type of trader you are going to be—a day trader or an end-of-day (EOD) trader. An EOD
trader, or swing trader, can buy and hold a stock for a week or even up to a few months.
Becoming a swing trader is the preferred choice for most traders who are using end-of-day
data. Those who buy and hold stocks for years are known as position traders or long-term
investors.
The next question is to find out how are you going to trade—will it be discretionary trading
or system trading? The type of trading will define the time frame. Active traders who enjoy a
fastpacedstylewouldnotfindmuchactioninweeklyormonthlytimeframes,whilelessactive
tradersgenerallyfindthattheextremely shorttimeframesaretootediousortaketoomuchof
their time. Decide which style best suits your personality, and then select the corresponding
timeframe.
One important reminder, regardless of whatever time frame you are going to trade in, you
havetodohomework.Youhavetodoyouranalysisoutsideofmarkethours,becausewhenthe
market opens, you will not have sufficient time to think and deliberate on the course of your
actions.
Since the data used in this book are end-of-day data, the book addresses issues from the
view of swing traders, and the trading methodology adopted is a combination of mechanical
system trading and discretionary trading, as outlined in Chapter 2 and Chapter 7. Some swing
traders are discretionary; they use technical and/or fundamental analysis to evaluate each
potential trade, and make decisions based on the rules they have outlined for themselves. If
they have a good intuitive sense of the market, they may also use discretionary stops. Many
professional traders use discretionary stops, but we would not recommend it for the novice or
beginningtrader.

SELECTING STOCKS
Therearemanymethods forchoosing stockstotrade.Stocksmaybeselected onthecriteria of
fundamental and/or technical analysis. The market index may be used as a benchmark to
choose those stocks within a certain range of price-earnings ratios, dividend yield, and
consistent earnings. But there is one universal rule: Never buy any stock on hearsay
information, no matter where the information comes from, without doing a study of it prior to
the purchase. More exoteric approaches on how to select stocks are provided in the next
chapter;however,themethodsarenotexhaustive.
Whichever method you prefer in selecting stocks, do not trade a stock that has no trading
liquidity. If a stock is not very liquid, it means that you may not be able to buy and sell it at the
volume you want, at the price you would like, or when you want. Trading liquidity is therefore
important to the relative size of your holding. Here is a simple example. If the average daily
tradingvolumeofthestockisabout10,000shares,itwouldnotbeinyourbestinteresttohold
100,000 shares because you will not be able to dispose of them quickly when the trend turns
bearish. But, on the other hand, if the average daily trading volume is 100,000 shares, it should
notbedifficultforyoutodisposeofyourholding.
After you have picked the list of stocks to trade, you then have to decide on position sizing:
the number of stocks to trade and the dollar value of each stock you feel you will be able to
handle without undue stress. Should you focus all your trades on one stock, or should you
spread your trades to cover multiple stocks? It will depend on your capabilities and capital
exposure. Some traders may not be able to handle more than 10 stocks in their trading
portfolio. Having a diversified trading portfolio covering a wider selection of stocks does not
necessarily mean lesser risks. In managing a trading portfolio, there is a limit to the size of
portfolios each person can handle in terms of number of stocks and value; you have to find the
limit that you will be comfortable with. Remember that in trading, having a large list of stocks
may not necessarily give you a balanced portfolio if you are unable to focus and manage your
stocksefficiently.

RISK MANAGEMENT
In trading stocks, there is no way that a trader can avoid taking losses on some trades. Some of
the most successful traders are those who are willing to take a loss. The question is how much
of a loss is a trader willing to take, and does he have the discipline to cut his losses. Having a
tradingstrategyisagoodstart,butitwillnotmeananythingifthetraderhasnoideaofmoney
management in trading. Money management planning is a very important part of trading and
hasoneobjective:capitalpreservation.Therearemanyriskmanagementtechniques.Itisupto
each trader to form his own plan of how he will keep risk to a minimum while, at the same
time,keepinghisinvestmentatamaximumlevelwithinthedegreeofriskheiswillingtotake.
Before a trader commits to trading, the risk factor of managing various stocks should be
included in the trading plan. Trading stocks is about keeping risks to a minimum. A trader
should have a realistic profit target that meets his reward to risk ratio. What is the estimated
profit of the stock against its downside risk? Many professional traders do not take a trade
unless the potential profit is at least three times greater than the possible loss. How much risk
is appropriate varies with each trader and may be as high as 5 percent of the total portfolio
value on a given day, or as low as 1 percent of the total portfolio. Some traders may prefer
having different risk ratios for each stock, but will also take into consideration the risk factor
against the aggregate risk of the trading portfolio. Through trial and error, a trader has to find
thatcomfortzoneinwhichhecantradeconfidently.

DETERMINE ENTRY POINTS
Having made your selection of stocks does not mean a trade should be entered immediately.
You have yet to determine the specific conditions including entry price, which allow you to
execute your trade, and initial protective stops, which allow you to exit should the market turn
againstyou.Thisisthechallenge.
In trading, you need to know when to engage in a trade and when not to trade; you do not
needtotradeeveryday.Youcannotbetradingallthetime,especiallywhenthetrendisagainst
you. Catching the trend of the market is the key. However, the market does not move in trend
all the time. When the market is not trending, you have to stay on the sideline. You will win
when you are trading with the trend because you will have the support of the trend. You will

DETERMINE EXIT STRATEGIES
Traders have various choices when it comes to exiting trades. Some traders use “trailing” stops
as their exit strategy of choice, while others choose to exit when the stock hits a certain target
percentage, or breaks through a support or resistance level. Some traders will choose to exit
based on expected news releases. The exit strategy is one of the most important parts of any
trading plan, and it is important for traders to have an exit plan before entering a trade. In the

CHAPTER9
FinancialAstrology
This chapter deals with how to make use of the lunar cycle. The lunar cycle manifests as the
most frequent and predominant cycle among the various astrological cycles. Cyclical patterns
have been observed in many fields, such as biology, astronomy, agriculture, and social spheres,
to mention a few. It is well accepted that the phases of the Moon influence people’s behavior,
and scientists established long ago their relation to the rising and falling of the tides. In July
2010, the Royal Bank of Scotland published a report on the correlations between the Moon’s
phasesandthebehavioroffinancialmarkets(“SheerLunacyStaringattheHeavens,”
www.rbsm.com/strategy
). The study showed a remarkable increase in profits in a lunar-based buy-sell strategy as
comparedtoaregularbuy-holdstrategy.

                     PAGE 171                     
==================================================

USING LUNAR CYCLES IN TRADING
The lunar buy-sell strategy is based on buying on the new moon and selling on the next full
moon(usuallyin14to16days).WequotehereanexcerptfromtheBankofScotlandreport:“If
an investor had invested PStg 1000 in FTSE in 1984, by now he would have approx. PStg 5,130
by holding the index, which represents index performance, whereas trading FTSE according to
moon phases would make a big difference. First, consider buying FTSE on the new moon and
selling on the full moon, this would result in PStg12, 116 overall figure for the same period. It
means more than double the profits.” It is noteworthy that the strategy would have been even
moreprofitablefortheDAXandtheHSI.TheresultfortheS&P500dataisalsohigher,butthat
isbecausethestrategywasappliedsince1928.
Conversely, buying on the full moon and selling on the new moon would have considerably
underperformedthebuy-holdstrategy.Thissupportsthetheoryofacorrelationbetweenindex
prices and moon phases because the new moon traditionally symbolizes low energy or energy
accumulation, whereas the time of the full moon is a period of fruition, high energy, and
spending.
The influence of planetary cycles on stocks has also been well documented by Raymond A.
Merriman in his seminal work, The Ultimate Book on Stock Market Timing, Volumes 1 to 5, in
which he describes how solar and lunar phases correlate to short-term trading reversals.
Similarly, Patrick Mikula, using TradeStation software back in the 1990s, tested a lunar-based
buy-sellsystemcombinedwithstochasticmomentumonsoybeanfutures,andfoundthatusing
the new moon for the entry and the full moon for the exit had the highest correlation. For the
period tested, the system produced 44 trades with an overall 66 percent profitability, with the
longtradesbeing54percentprofitableandtheshorttrades88percentprofitable.
So it is quite well established that the phases of the Moon influence the prices of certain
stocks and also of some commodities like wheat, corn, soybeans, and silver. For the sake of
simplicity, we are only concerned with two of the various Sun-Moon phases, namely when the
Moon forms a 0-degree conjunction with the Sun at the new moon (the Sun, Moon, and Earth
appear in line) and when the Moon is in opposition to the Sun at the full moon, or 180 degrees
apart. The Sun and Moon are in square aspect (90 degrees) during the first and third quarters,
in 120-degree aspect during a waxing or waning gibbous moon, and in a 60-degree aspect
during a waxing or waning crescent moon. These latter aspects do not have the same influence
as the 0- and 180-degree aspects, but tend to influence the market upward during trines (120
degrees), downward during squares, and can influence the market in either direction during
sextiles(60degrees).Sometraderssimplyaddthetimeofthenewandfullmoondatestotheir

Lunar cycles are subject to the laws of accumulation and redistribution. The first half of the
lunar month is a process of accumulation in which the market grows. The second half of the
lunar month is often one of redistribution and weakness. This pattern works well in a rising
market, but can become a trap if the market enters a bear phase, with shares falling sharply.
Therefore, if there is no accumulation in the first half of the lunar month, traders should be
alerttothefactthattheremaybeachangeinthelargertrend.
To test the observation that lunar cycle coincides with swing tops and bottoms, it is
suggestedthatamomentumindicator,suchasstochastics,isincluded.Ideally,thebuysignalin
the new moon phase should coincide with a reading below 20 in the stochastics. A reading
above 80 should coincide with a sell signal. Naturally, the correlation doesn’t always manifest
so clearly, but the combination is another way of filtering out those Moon-phased buy and sell
signalsthatmaybeoutofsyncwiththeprevailingmarket.
Lunar signals can apply quite well to some individual stocks, but for the most part, it will be
foundthattheycorrespondbettertomajorindexes,commodities, andsomecommodity-based
ETFs.Thisismainly because oftheMoon’s known influence onmasspsychology. However, one
should not rely only on a lunar-phased buy-sell program for trading. What the examples are
meant to show is that the lunar phase may be a useful additional indicator, and that the
correlation with market moves is significant enough statistically to warrant the inclusion in
one’sarsenaloftradingtools.

HOW TO PICK WINNING STOCKS
Investors nowadays have access to a large number of software programs and free online
servicesthatallowthemtoselectstocksbasedonacustomizedsetofconditionsandvariables.
Some services apply fundamental analysis to rate thousands of listed companies, perhaps on a
10-point scale, using advanced mathematical systems to determine a stock’s expected risk and
return,ortosimplyrateita“buy,”“hold,”or“sell.”Othermethodsofevaluatingsecuritiesmay
involve technical analysis, as described in Chapter 7, Applied Systems, and Chapter 8,
Formulating Your Trading Plan. There are endless ways one can approach the process, but a
combination of both fundamental and technical analysis seems to be the preferred method for
most investors and fund managers. Given the plethora of choices, the overriding question is
still, how does one improve one’s chances of picking the stock with the best potential to go up
in value? Not everyone has the stock-picking talent of Peter Lynch or Warren Buffett, or access
tosophisticatedquantitativestock-ratingprograms,soanordinaryinvestorortradermayoften
be at a disadvantage. Moreover, stock picking has almost become a lost art since the onset of
the financial crisis. Sentiment has alternated between euphoria and despair, and time-proven
methodologies have failed in the extraordinarily volatile environment since the financial
meltdownin2008.
This section is not meant to be a primer on how to select stocks or build portfolios using
conventional value-analysis methods like the top-down or bottom-up approaches. Many other
books are available on those topics. The aim is to provide some additional tools that may help
in the stock-selection process through a combination of conventional and more esoteric
approaches.
Before starting, it may be of interest to know how six different fundamental investment
strategies have performed in Asia’s stock markets since the beginning of 1997. Research was
undertaken in July 2009 by strategists Daniel McCormack and Viking Kwok at Macquarie Bank
and reviewed by Tom Holland of the South China Morning Post (“Valuations Say Buy, But the
FearfulDoubtTheirValidity,” SCMPMonitor,December3,2008).
Some widely used techniques performed surprisingly poorly. Buying the shares of companies
with the strongest balance sheets, for example, would have produced lousy returns.
Macquarie’s analysts ranked their universe by the Altman Z score—a common measure of
financialhealth—andfoundthat,overthepast10years,thestrongest20percentofcompanies
significantlyunderperformedtherestofthemarket.
Buying stocks with strong earnings growth proved similarly disappointing. In this case, the
Macquarie analysts ranked companies by expected earnings growth and found that the first
quintile—thetop20percent—performed justaspoorlyasthebottomquintile,withthesecond
quintiledoingalmostasbadly.
Momentum investing didn’t do well either. Although momentum investing is a popular
strategy, buying stocks that have performed well recently doesn’t work. Macquarie ranked
equities by their performance over the previous three months and found that the first quintile
subsequentlyunderperformedthemarket.Theweakestquintiledeliveredthebestreturns.
In fact, by far the best strategies for buyers of Asian stocks over the last 12 years have been
classic value-driven techniques. Buying stocks for their dividend yield works reasonably well,
withthefirstquintilehandsomelyoutperformingwhenmarketsareweak.
Simply buying the cheapest stocks in the market delivers the best returns, however.
According to Macquarie, the 20 percent of stocks with the lowest price to earnings ratios



==================================================
                     PAGE 176                     
==================================================

outperformedtheoverallmarket63percentofthetime.
It has been even better, however, to invest in the cheapest stocks ranked on a price to book
value basis. In this case, buying the first quintile—Q1, or the cheapest 20 percent of
stocks—hasbeenwhatMacquariecalls“amassiveandconsistentoutperformer,”whateverthe
state of the wider market. In view of this information, traders might do well to incorporate
pricetobookvalueintotheirfundamentalselectioncriteria.
The need to hone stock-picking skills is obviously critical to the performance of any investor
or fund manager, and was brought home again recently when a leading fund reported the
results of their trading for the past week on October 18, 2010. The report mentioned that the
model portfolio returned 1.7 percent while the underlying index gained 6.7 percent. On
examining the fund’s portfolio, it turned out that although many of the stocks had been in the
right sectors and had appreciated nicely, all the gains were offset by some underperforming
stocks or “laggards.” Using the stock-screening procedure described below, these “laggards”
might well have been excluded from the start, and the performance of the fund would have
greatly improved. We shall take a closer look at two of them (151 Want Want and 828 Dynasty
FineWines)laterinthechapter.
So how to go about it? The first step is to establish a database of all those shares one has
interestinandloadtheminachartingsoftwareprogram,suchasTradeStationorMetaStockor
anyoneofthemanyothersthatareavailable.
Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, and quite a few others provide stock prices and
fundamental data for free. One may also subscribe to a stock-screening service or use Internet
sitessuchasYahoo!Financeor FinancialTimes (at
www.ft.com
), where it is possible to compare the price performance with other stocks in the same
sector.At
www.ft.com
, one may run a stock screen based on favorite parameters, including return on equity, P/E
ratios, or preferred price range, and it will screen all the stocks listed in major markets around
the world. It is even possible to use a screener that combines both fundamental and technical
analysissuchastheoneprovidedbyFinancialVisualizations(at
www.finviz.com
). In addition to the financial ratios the screener identifies stocks based on technical patterns
orspecificcandlestickformations.
It is assumed the reader has access to a charting program with a stock-screening function.

Roughly speaking, about one-third of the stocks are mainland companies listed on our local
bourse. A scan of these shares therefore provides an investor or trader with an opportunity to
selectastockthatistiedinwiththedynamiceconomiesofChinaand/orHongKong.
Screening the stocks is a fairly simple procedure, and we find the following three methods in
MetaStock’s Explorer function mostuseful:PriceandVolumeBreakout, PandFPattern Search,
andLong-TermBullish/Bearish. (MetaStock isownedbyEquisInternational andsomefunctions
areundertheprefixEquis.)
In
Figure9.4
, MetaStock Explorer-Equis: Price and Volume Breakout displays securities where the price is
increased 5 percent and the volume is 50 percent above the 50-day moving average. A total of
24 stocks meet these criteria. The purpose is to spot stocks that are breaking out of a medium-
term trading range, or down from it, and then do an astro-screen of those stocks, as explained
lateron.
In order to spot stocks that break out of a range, the P and F Pattern Search in the Explorer
can be useful as well—“P and F” meaning Point and Finger chart analysis. Usually, only a few

StockinvestorsmayalsoconsiderusingEquis:Long-TermBullish,whichidentifiesstocksover
their 200-day moving average, and Long-Term Bearish, which identifies stocks below their 200-
day moving average. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, 40 weeks, that is, 200 trading days, is
a widely followed moving average indicator, but here we are only concerned with the total

                     PAGE 178                     
==================================================

number of shares above and the total number below as a sort of sentiment indicator. As of
November 22, 2010, the number above, or bullish, was 780, while the number below, or
bearish, was 511. The ratio has shifted substantially since the onset of the recent correction,
but the reading may still be considered bullish and adds weight to the view that the decline is
correctiveonly,andthelargeruptrendisstillintact.
Incidentally, whenitcomestofinancialstatistics, AsiaisstillfarbehindtheUnitedStatesand
Europe in terms of the huge range of stock market statistics that is available in those places.
One would expect a stock exchange to provide reliable statistics and historical data for
independent research; however, for some Asian bourses, often the daily advance decline
numbers do not tally and therefore cannot serve as a reliable gauge of sentiment. Moreover,
the respective volume of advancing and declining stocks, VIX index, and daily data with no
openingpricecanonlybeobtainedthroughdatavendors.
The next step necessitates having access to an astrological software program such as AIR
MarketTrader,TimingSolution,orGalacticTrader.Theseprogramsoffermulti-searchfunctions
basedonthe“first-trade”dateandscanthecompaniesaccordingtocertainastrologicalinputs.
These inputs include prevailing “good” planetary aspects, such as 60 degree sextiles, or 120
degree trines, and “bad” aspects such as 90 degree squares or 180 degree oppositions, and

Solution, so the user doesn’t need to have extensive knowledge about astrology and may just
apply the good or bad screens to stocks, similar to applying the lunar-phased indicator. The
result of even a simple good or bad aspect scan can sometimes turn up “nuggets” in that the
scan can alert investors to a share that has the potential to start rallying before it actually
breaksout.
It should be noted that the “first trade” date charts used in multi-search are separate from a
company’s date of incorporation charts. Incorporation charts are drawn up when a company
starts its business, and may indicate something about the ongoing operations of the company,
such as changes in management, product releases, or other internal matters. First-trade charts,
on the other hand, are based on the date and time of the first trade on a stock exchange; that
is, when the company launches its initial public offering (IPO), and trading of its shares to the
public and institutions begins. The first-trade chart is very reliable, as the time is normally
alwaysthesameastheopening oftrading. Itusedtobe10a.m.inHongKong, butonMarch 7,
2011, it changed to 9:30 a.m. to be in line with other exchanges. The first-trade chart relates to
investor interest and concerns, and is the more important of the two charts. To find the dates
for a first trade database is a time-consuming job, which may deter some investors. Hopefully,
thefollowingdiscussionwillconvincesomeitisworththeeffort.
The first-trade database we are going to use for Hong Kong shares contains 850 stocks.
Unfortunately, for about 20 or so leading shares, including HSBC Holdings, there are no known
listing dates, so those stocks could not be utilized. It should also be noted that the total
database of 1,300 stocks mentioned earlier was formed by adding 450 other active stocks to
the850first-tradestocks.

CHOOSING THE BEST PERIODS FOR TRADING
The foregoing has dealt with some important tools to becoming a successful investor or trader.
One aspect that is almost never considered is how to choose the best periods for trading.
Traders use their skills to analyze the market, determine the best trade setups, and determine
when to enter and exit trades, but few pay any attention to their own astrological cycle. Most
people go through personal cycles of profit and loss, and perhaps more so those who are
engaged in trading or fund management. So why not sidestep some of the risky or adverse
periods and resume trading when there is a personal change in trend and a higher probability
ofwinning?
To begin with, what is meant by the “best periods for trading”? They are, simply put, those
periods when a person might benefit from favorable astro-harmonic aspects of his or her birth
chart or natal chart. In the case of a company, its natal chart is the date of incorporation.
However, to compile a date of incorporation chart for a company is difficult because it is hard
to obtain the precise time of incorporation of most companies. Thus, for the purpose of this
section, natal charts of a company are based on the first-trade charts, that is, the first day of
tradinginthestockofacompanyonanexchange.
Adverse periods are those when the aspects are stressful or inharmonious to one’s natal
chart. For day traders and other professionals who trade frequently, it may be useful to know
when the planetary influences are in their favor and when they are not. Knowing the influence
of the planets could also be critical in situations where decisions have to be made about very
large investments, whether short-term or long-term. It is already common practice among
some traders to use prevailing stock market cycles to project likely change in trend dates, but
they might benefit as well from incorporating astro-forecasting techniques in their analysis
work.

==================================================

Although, in general, the subject of this chapter is financial astrology, the emphasis in this
section is more on learning natal (personal) astrology, so that a trader or investor may identify
those periods that are more fortuitous for him or her to trade. Many financial astrologers will
tradebasedontheanalysisoftransitstoacompany’sfirst-tradechart,butexperienceindicates
that the focus should be more on personally favorable periods rather than more generally
favorable periods for stock charts. The reason is simply that if one has unfavorable or hard
aspects,suchas90degreesquares,toplanetsinthe“moneyhouses,”ortoplanetsrulingthose
houses in one’s natal horoscope, it may result in losses in trading. One may pick a stock with
presumably good potential, but because of the hard aspects to one’s personal horoscope, one
mayoverlooksomethingimportantorcircumstancesmaysuddenlychangeinunforeseenways.
Trading during unfavorable transits should therefore be avoided. It is hoped that the following
introduction, albeit brief, will enable traders to learn some basic astrological techniques. These
techniquescanhelpthemanalyzetheirbirthchartssotheycantakeadvantageofthefavorable
periods and curtail trading during unfavorable ones. Once the basics of natal astrology have
been mastered, many of the same principles can be applied to analyzing stock charts, although
the terminology and the rulership definitions differ. For easy reference, definitions of both
personalandfinancialrulershipsareincludedinAppendixes1and3.
It is of course possible that an investor or trader is not trading for himself but for an
organization, and where natal astrology does not apply to the same extent. In such a case, it
may be useful to analyze the first-trade chart on the basis of the introduction to astrology
provided in the following paragraphs. However, it is recommended that traders screen their
tradesbythestock-selectionmethodintheprevioussection,“HowtoPickWinningStocks.”
Astrology is, to quite a large extent, a mathematical discipline based on astronomy. Applied
properly,itwillenabletraderstoquiteaccuratelyforecastperiodsofincreasedmarketvolatility
and financial instability. Financial astrologers chart both intermediate and long-range trends,
reflecting the movement of the heavenly bodies and their influence on people on Earth. Some

may question how the planets, being so far away, can exert any influence on life on Earth, or
they may simply have no interest in astrology. Nonetheless, if they are willing to study the
subject a little more, they may be surprised at how often cosmic events or specific positions
andaspectsbetweentheplanetscorrelatewithterrestrialevents.
It used to be that traders cared more about whether a methodology was acceptable and
logical than they did about the results. However, that appears to be changing, judging from the
great interest shown at recent seminars when speakers introduced more esoteric methods of
trading the markets. The next generation of traders seems more willing to try new approaches,
perhaps spurred in part by the more advanced trading software programs that are now
available.
Learning astrology, however, with all its strange symbols and terminology, can still be
intimidating. This section is an attempt to shorten the learning curve, so at least one aspect of
the craft can be applied. It will, of course, still take some effort, but users are almost certain to
gainanedgeonthemarketandultimatelybeamplyrewarded.
In fact, a trader might not need to know that much about astrology to use some of these
methods. AIR Market Trader software has a module called Millennium Star Trax. Using this
program, a person may simply input his or her birthplace and date and time of birth, and the
programwillcalculatethelikelyfuturetrendforcertainareasoflife,includingfinancialareas.It
is also possible to produce a general forecast, showing periods that are likely to be harmonious
andthosethatmaybestressfulinhistogramorlineformat.
However, to master the subject for maximum benefit, it is still necessary to learn the basics

Astrology can be baffling at first, because it involves a different kind of language or wisdom.
There are four parts to any birth chart: planets, signs, houses, and aspects. The astrological use
of planets, the house system, and the aspects has evolved since astrology’s earliest recorded
beginnings about 5,000 years ago. Archaeologists uncovered evidence that the Sumerians, as
earlyas2900b.c.e.,builttemplesintheformofziggurats,orterracedpyramids,toobservethe
stars and planets. The Babylonians developed astrology further, as evidenced in their clay
tabletsfromaround500b.c.e.Thetabletscontainlistsoflunarandplanetaryobservationsthat
were used, among others, to predict whether the most common commodities, barley, dates,
and sesame would prosper. The careful recording of prices indicates the Babylonians were
charting the markets and sought to predict future prices much like modern-day technicians do.
However, it was the Greeks who made the biggest contributions, through their refinement of
the house system and use of Ptolemaic aspects from Ptolemy’s book on astrology, Tetrabiblos.
Together, these developments enabled more accurate measurements and predictions to be
made.
There are many constellations in the sky, but by tradition, Western astrologers use the
tropical zodiac of the signs. Most are familiar with this zodiac, which begins each year at the
vernal equinox, the first day of spring on about March 21, at 0 degrees Aries. A horoscope, or
birth chart, is a diagram of the precise positions of the planets in the sky at the moment of
one’sbirth.Itisdividedinto12equalsegmentstoreflectthe12constellationsofthezodiac.

The Descendant, also referred to as the “setting sign,” represents our relationship to those
around us and those whom we attract into life. It may be defined in short as “relating to
others.”
The Immun Coeli, or IC, on the cusp of the fourth house, is most closely associated with
issuesrelatingtohome,thepast,family,anddomesticconcerns.
There are many techniques for making predictions. However, in this discussion, we shall only
beusing the transiting planets andtheir position inthe skyatanygiven moment relative tothe
natal planets. The term “transit” refers to the position and motion of the planets in the sky at

The patterns change endlessly throughout life. The aspects forming between the planets
allow us to know in advance when there will be difficulties to overcome and when there is a
productivetimetoact.
For example, stressful aspects of planets in transit to the planets ruling the signs of the
“money” houses, that is, the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh houses, and/or planets
occupying those houses in one’s chart are nearly always a warning not to trade, or to at least
reduce trading. Traders will find that the most profitable times for trading are when the right
aspects align favorably with the position of their money planets. The aspects of transit planets

In interpreting the chart, note first that the Sun and the Moon are conjunct in the sign of
Scorpio in the second house of money. Next, take note of the Ascendant or rising sign, being
the most important point in the chart. In this case, it is in Libra, and provides clues as to the
personality of the native and how he may appear or project himself outwardly. Proceed to the
Midheaven, in Cancer, and note the key characteristics of that sign. Next, look at planets or
points that are close to one of the four main or cardinal angles, as any angular position always
has greater importance. In the chart shown, the point called Part of Fortune (POF), to be dealt
with in greater detail later, is almost exactly conjunct the Ascendant, reinforcing the influence
ofthisfortuitouspoint.

Finally, pay close attention to the aspects between the various planets in the chart. Note the
120 degree trine aspect between Jupiter in the tenth house of career to Venus in the second
house of money, which is very favorable for acquiring wealth. Jupiter, however, is also in
opposition to Mars, which in the author’s experience often signifies: can make a fortune, can

that lists the transiting planets automatically to a certain chart point, and which provides

Let’sproceednowtothelastpartofthebirthchart,thePartofFortune.
The Part of Fortune, or POF,can be traced to ancient times. But it was a text written by Al-
Biruni, an Arab astrologer that made the so-called Arabic parts more known. Al-Biruni lived in
the late Middle Ages, when the most interesting research and uses of astrology occurred in the
Arabic world. There are historically 32 different Arabic parts including parts of death, illness,
marriage, journeys, and soon. They are points constructed onthe mathematical calculations of
twoorthreecomponents,suchasplanetsorhousecusps.
However, only the Part of Fortune, which can be calculated on most computer programs, is
now in common use. Since POF is based on the longitude degrees of the Sun, Moon, and
Ascendant, three of the most important places in the horoscope, it becomes as important as
theyare,afactthatissometimesoverlooked.OnlytheMidheavenisasimportant,butbecause
thePOFisbasedonthreecomponentsonly,theMCisexcludedfromthecalculation.
The POF symbol is the circle around a cross, shown in the previous figures, and is placed in
thenatalchartaccordingtothisformula:
Day births (a.m.): Fortune = Ascendant’s longitude degree position plus Moon position
minus the Sun’s degree position. For night births (p.m.), the Moon and Sun’s position are
reversed.
POF is interpreted as being a primary indicator of prosperity, and its position in the natal
chartshowswhereandhowapersonmaygainhonors,makemoney,orbeluckyduringhislife.
Transits to POF bring opportunities for gain, as the following examples will illustrate. When
transiting Jupiter conjuncts POF in the natal chart, it is often a time when a person may benefit
materially or advance in his or her career. The synodic cycle (one complete orbit relative to the
Sun) for Jupiter is about 12 years, so it will not be of much interest for those who trade
frequently.However,theotheraspectsmentionedinthechecklistin
Table9.1
have been found to trigger fortunate events as well. So, in reality, there is a beneficial
aspect between transiting Jupiter and POF about every two years. Of course, not all may be as
fortunate as when there is a conjunction between Jupiter and POF, which is the strongest
aspect, but traders may still find it worthwhile to make a note in their calendar when any of
theseeventsoccur.
To work out their own horoscope, traders may want to use a freeware astro-program, or go
to
www.astrodienst.com
, which provides a comprehensive chart service that includes a function to plot Arabic parts.
Write down the sign and the degree position of the POF, as well as the degree position of
transiting Jupiter, and use a software program or an ephemeris to determine when the aspects
culminateorbecomeexact.
It is also possible to plot important astrological events with Timing Solution. For instance,

said to be “applying.” Conversely, after it has reached conjunction and is moving away it is said
to be “separating.” The applying effect is usually stronger than the separating one, but in the
case of transiting Jupiter to POF, the effect is often the opposite, so the beneficial effects of
Jupiter’s contact may only manifest after the exact conjunction, not before. The orb (sphere of

MARKET PROJECTION
Can we predict the market using astrological methods? Forecasting the probability of market
direction has been the primary goal of every trader since early times. When will the market
make a peak? Or when will it make a trough? These are everyday questions in the mind of
every trader. The age-old market prediction method of using advanced mathematical
calculations andhistorical economic data,sector data,andpricedatahasbeenthecornerstone
of making market forecasts. And it is still the most acceptable method. But the method works
well only when the market is not subject to so much volatility. The world today is plagued with
uncertainties caused by natural disasters, man-made disasters, military conflicts, political
unrest, and corporate fraud and scams, occurring at unexpected frequent intervals, seemingly
without end. Therefore, the old methods seem inadequate to make a reasonably reliable
predictionofmarketmovementstoday.
Thestockmarketistoosensitive,tooerraticandchaoticforsuchbasicforecasts.Thechange
of value of the shares is always related to future expectations, not the supposed correct value
at the moment of trade. It is in these challenging circumstances that prediction using financial
astrology adds its value as a complement to the traditional method by revealing another
dimension.Forecastsmadeusingtheplanetarymovementsthroughthezodiaccanincreasethe
odds in favor of the trader significantly. While some traders continue to use traditional
methods and scoff at financial astrology, astro-harmonic analysis is nevertheless gaining more
widespreadacceptance.Sincetheturmoilinthemarketsthatbeganin2008,agrowingnumber
of traders, including some at large institutions, have adopted astrological analysis to boost the
results of their trading decisions. They realize that combining fundamental and technical
analyses with financial astrology can improve the performance of their trading. The advantages
of knowing in advance probable major price reversals for a stock through astrological methods
areincalculable.
Moreover, today, using financial astrology for reading markets has become easier for users.
The phenomenal development of software applications, especially in the last decade or so, has
helped spur wider use by traders. It is now possible to undertake complex analysis of economic
cycles and examine the extent to which planetary constellations correlate with movements in
financial markets, including the Forex and commodities markets. Even phenomena such as
sunspot activity, tidal flows, and other factors can be studied to see if they correlate with
terrestrial events. Still, of course, the main purpose is to measure the relationship between
planetarymovementsandthemarketsandmakeuseofthemintrading.
In this regard, the expanded capability of computer programs adds a new dimension to
technical analysis. They offer a hybrid of common technical analysis techniques (charting tools
and indicators) and modern math methods (neural networks and applied statistics), measuring
astro-cycle correlations and providing the opportunity to model the market. A few examples of
thesetechniquesareshownin

Figure9.26
shows a market projection as of December 30, 2009. Briefly, the composite module
calculates the projection line based on how various astro-cycles relate to the first-trade chart
and the historical data on a daily basis. It includes optimizing the correlation between the
projection line and the relative price oscillator (RPO) to ensure the closest possible match. RPO
is similar to RSI, but has been de-trended in order to smoothen the price swings over a longer
period. The optimized composite result is loaded into the Neural Network module, which takes
all the criteria that were part of the setup and analyzes the historical price data again, using
artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic math to educate itself. The results are used to make future
projections.

CONCLUSION
The charts in this chapter have shown the correlation between the planetary cycles and the
financial markets. Nevertheless, some may still ask, what is the underlying physical mechanism
by which astrology works? In other words, how does a celestial object from as far away as 9
billionmilesexertinfluence?
Australian astrologer Alice McDermott suggests that, instead of looking at it from the
perspective of a tiny little life form on a smallish planet in a solar system on the edge of a
galaxy,weshouldtrytoseethequestionfromasolarsystemperspective.
TheEarthisapartofasolarsystem.FromtheEarth’spointofview,itispartofthestructure
ofthissolarsystem, justasourgallbladdersarepartofouroverallphysicalstructure. Whatwe
see as very long distances, millions of miles, are actually quite small from a solar system
perspective. All the planets in this solar system are all part of the same life force and all
influenceeachother.
AsweareallpartoftheEarth,naturallyweareallaffectedbywhatgoesoninourownsolar

In essence, astrology works through harmonic resonance. Everything resonates with
everything else and a variety of individual energies (certain stars, planets, people, animals,
plants, insects, etc.) can resonate along the same vibrational lines, thereby having a strong
connection.
So, as the cosmos moves, so does life on Earth. The task faced by astrologers since early
timeshasbeentocorrelatethesymboliclanguageofastrologywitheventshereonEarth.Itisa
daunting task. But anyone practicing astrology in earnest realizes after a while that we humans

to some extent by powerful software programs. It might be imprudent, however, to rely only
on a mechanical computerized system to try to decipher the influence the planets have on
Earth. With experience, one learns to use various forecasting techniques, which each in their
own way yield pieces of the puzzle, and ultimately to synthesize all the information to come to
aconclusionastothelikelydirectionofastockorofamarket.
Somesayitisimpossible toforecast thetrend ofanycommodity orfinancial instrument. But
tests measuring correlation of various market predictions with complex astro-cycle analysis are
steadily improving. Astro-cycle analysis is expected to improve in the coming years, given the
acceleratingpaceofefficiencytestingandevermorepowerfulback-testingprograms.
Without doubt, as the competition intensifies in the coming decades, investors and traders
will seek more tools to help them outperform the market. It is not beyond the realm of
possibility that financial stock quote companies, including leading ones like Financial Times,
Bloomberg, Reuters, and others, may one day publish lunar cycles and other astrological cycles
forinvestorswhowishtoaugmenttheirtradingstrategieswiththeinputofsuchdata.
It is often said, “the stars impel, they do not compel,” meaning that we have free will. In the
same vein, the foregoing is not meant to imply that our lives are wholly governed by the
planets. The purpose is only to show that, when used wisely, astrology can provide valuable
clues intrading. Combined with thetechnical analysismethods presented earlier, investors and

APPENDIX2
EffectsofVariousAspects
Theeffectsofthevariousaspectsareasfollows:
0 degrees (Conjunction). Major aspect. In fact, it is more a position rather than an aspect, but
for simplicity’s sake, it is classified as an aspect. It entails a close gathering of two or more
planets, ideally with the same zodiac degree. Conjunction symbolizes the cooperation of the
planets, which combine their potentials and reinforce each other. Whether this has positive or
negativeresultsdependslargelyonthenatureoftherelevantplanets.
60 degrees (Sextile). Major aspect. The sextile aspect involves two or more planets at an angle
of 60 degrees from one another. It denotes the ability to turn intellectual understanding into
productivity, to develop one’s talents, and to make use of opportunities for growth and for the
fulfillmentofone’shopesandwishes.Suchopportunitiesoftenariseundersextiletransits.
90 degrees (Square). Major aspect. An aspect between two or more planets positioned at an
angle of 90 degrees is called a square. Modern astrology regards the square as an aspect of
constant inner tension, urging the individual toward action in order to relieve it. Success is
frequently delayed or thwarted, either by circumstances or by inconsistent behavior, and often
demands great efforts over long periods. On the positive side, the square offers numerous
opportunities for learning and personal development, which are usually lacking in more
harmoniousaspects.
120 degrees (Trine). Major aspect. The trine is one of the classic Ptolemaic aspects, consisting
of two or more planets at an angle of 120 degrees from each other. The relevant planets are
said to cooperate in the most harmonious way, which is why traditional astrology calls it a
“benefic” aspect. The trine can bestow fortunate circumstances on a person, and positive
resultsonthematterathand.
180 degrees (Opposition). Major aspect. The opposition consists of two or more planets or
horoscopepointsseparatedbyanangleof180degrees;thatis,onoppositesidesofthezodiac.

30 degrees (Semi-sextile). Minor aspect. The semi-sextile is an aspect of 30 degrees; the

as beneficial and providing good opportunities. Others call the semi-sextile “dissociate” and

AbouttheAuthors
Robert T. H. Lee has over 50 years of experience in the financial industry and over 35 years of
experience in securities and investment banking. In 1960, he joined Malayan Banking Berhad,
Malaysia, and in 1964 he was transferred to its Hong Kong branch as a member of the senior
management. From 1977 to 1987, he served as the senior manager of another international
bank, now known as Development Bank of Singapore and, concurrently, as general manager of
its two subsidiaries, where he was responsible for all securities trading and investment
counseling. He then went into private practice where he provides corporate finance and
portfolio advisory services. Drawing from his experience in securities trading, he published a
book on technical analysis in 1997, Power Tools for Traders. For the past 15 years, he has
privately tutored many of his associates and fellow technicians, and he has been sharing his
views on trading psychology, money management, and trading methodology with his students.
Drawing on his insights from years of securities trading, Robert concludes that a trader should,
firstly, maintain a healthy mind and, secondly, that a trading method should be pragmatic. He
emphasizes that the most important thing of all is to know when to take a break from trading.
Currently, he is an Independent Non-Executive Director of Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holdings
Corp., a publicly listed company on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. He is also a
Senior Business Consultant for Henny Wee & Co., certified public accountants, Hong Kong, in
corporate governance and mergers and acquisitions. He is an associate of the Chartered
Institute of Bankers, London, a member of the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, and a member
oftheHongKongSecuritiesandInvestmentInstitute.
