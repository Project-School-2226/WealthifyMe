Without him there would be no book. He is a
man who has done close to the impossible:He has
balanced worldly success with spiritual success.

In 1923, seven men who had made it to the top of the finan-
cial success pyramid met together at the Edgewater Hotel in
Chicago. Collectively, they controlled more wealth than the en-
tire United States Treasury, and for years the media had held
them up as examples of success.
Who were they? Charles Schwab, president of the world’s
largest steel company, Arthur Cutten, the greatest wheat spec-
ulator of his day, Richard Whitney, president of the New York
Stock Exchange, Albert Fall, a member of the President’s
Cabinet, Jesse Livermore, the greatest bear on Wall Street,
Leon Fraser, president of the International Bank of Settlement,
and Ivan Kruegger, the head of the world’s largest monopoly.
What happened to them? Schwab and Cutten both died
broke; Whitney spent years of his life in Sing Sing peni-
tentiary; Fall also spent years in prison, but was released so
he could die at home; and the others Livermore, Fraser, and
Kruegger, committed suicide. Donald McCullogh,
Waking from the American Dream
The steps of a short sale are defined as a sale of stock you don’t
own, in anticipation of a drop in price. Stock is borrowed from
your broker for delivery to the purchaser. Later, stock is pur-
chased in the open market and returned to the broker to com-
plete the transaction. In other words, the stock is sold first then
bought later, hopefully at a lower price. This is the reverse of a
normal buy-first, sell-later transaction.

Preface
There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous
to conduct, or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead
in the introduction of a new order of things.
Niccolo Machiavelli
WHEN I WAS 13, MY FATHER TOLD ME ABOUT THE GREAT-
est stock trader who ever lived, Jesse Livermore. I sat and listened
as my father informed me that Livermore had set a new standard
for the trading of stocks. Fascinated, I began reading about Liver-
more before I was 14.
I did not know that 40 years later Livermore and I would have
a date with destiny—or that I would devote more than a year of
my life to investigating his life. I did not know that I would ulti-
mately get to know him as well as anyone ever did get to know
him.
Livermore was a person of great secrecy, mystery, and silence.
He strove to control his emotions and thereby overcome the
human frailty of passions that we all suffer from. Above all, he
wanted to beat the game, solve the puzzle, best the stock market.
Many readers will be familiar with Jesse Livermore under the
name Larry Livingston, from the best-selling book Reminiscences of
a Stock Operatorby Edwin LeFevre, a financial journalist. First pub-
lished in 1923, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is the fictionalized
biography of Livermore. There is no question that Reminiscences is
one of the best financial books ever written. Generations of
traders, investors, and market watchers have turned to it for insight

into the strategies of a great trader and for understanding of crowd
psychology and market timing.
After reading Reminiscences and Livermore’s own book, How to
Trade in Stocks, I realized that there was a lot more to Livermore’s
story. The published record revealed almost nothing about the real
Jesse Livermore. I embarked on a two-year journey that would
take me into Livermore’s world—both professional and personal. I
was able to interview Paul Livermore, Jesse’s surviving son, who
spoke for the record for the first time about his father. I also spoke
to Patricia Livermore, the wife of Jesse Livermore Junior and close
confidant of Dorothy Livermore, Livermore’s second wife and the
mother of his two children.
Just like the famous financier J.P. Morgan, Livermore suffered
from great bouts ofdepression throughout his life. In the period he
lived there were no remedies for this condition, and finally, in
1940, he ended his life by his own hand.
Livermore was quiet and secretive, yet lived a very opulent and
exciting life, moving in the highest social circles. He was person-
ally blamed for the great crash of 1929, and received numerous
death and kidnapping threats. He married a beautiful Ziegfeld Fol-
lies showgirl and fathered two children, one of whom would
eventually be shot by his own mother.
This book is a complete biography of Jesse Livermore, the man
and the trader. It chronicles his life in fine detail and also reveals
many new aspects of his groundbreaking trading techniques,
which were revolutionary then and which remain revolutionary
today.
There are four simple themes to this book.
First, human nature never changes. Therefore, the stock market
never changes. Only the faces, the pockets, the suckers and the
manipulators, the wars, the disasters, and the technologies change.
The market itself never changes. How can it? Human nature never

changes, and human nature runs the market—not reason, not eco-
nomics, and certainly not logic. It is our human emotions that
drive the market, as they do most other things on this planet.
Second, the achievement of material goals and career ambitions
does not equal the achievement of happiness in life. There is no
correlation between success and happiness. There is no automatic
balance between worldly riches and emotional fulfillment.
Third, it is our will that allows each of us to accomplish our
goals, not our intellect. Talent is not enough. Luck is not enough.
Only the will to suffer hard work and incredible persistence leads
to the attainment of the impossible. There are no shortcuts;there
is no easy way. Especially, as you’ll find out, in the stock market.
Finally, it is the individual, not the group, that has led to the
great discoveries of humanity. The great ideas, the great fortunes,
and the giant steps forward in technology, politics, and medicine
have all come from individuals, not groups.
There are many ways to play the market, hundreds of theories,
techniques, systems, and strategies. This book covers Livermore’s
approach. It reveals for the first time in one volume his secrets on
how to successfully speculate and make money. A great deal of the
research conducted on Livermore’s life was based on interviews
with his family, personal papers, newspaper accounts, and Liver-
more’s own writings. Some poetic license was taken in recreating
dialogue to paint a more vibrant picture of Jesse Livermore, the
man, and his times. In certain parts of the book I have replicated
conversations as they were told to me by family members.
And I think you will agree, after reading this book, that there
never was another stock market speculator like Jesse Livermore.

The Great Bear of Wall Street
Chaos is come again. Shakespeare, Othello
Early on the morning ofTuesday, October 29th, the canyons of
Wall Street were thronged with thousands of excited thrill-
seekers who had come to witness the anticipated carnage. Po-
licemen on horseback and detectives in uniform attempted to
keep the mob clear of the entrance to the New York Stock Ex-
change, but it was no use;every time they succeeded in opening
a pathway, the jostling crowd immediately closed ranks again.
Inside, on the floor of the exchange, one could actually feel
the tension and fear in the air as the hands of the clock crawled
toward 10:00 and the opening gong. Less than a week earlier
on Black Thursday, the stock market had suffered the most dis-
astrous decline in its history, and the staggering plunge of prices
on the following Monday afternoon had only increased the pre-
vailing sense of panic.
In broker’s rooms across the country, investors visited nerv-
ously and coughed and shifted their feet as they stood and stared
in hypnotic fascination at the silent stock ticker, the mechanical
courier that would soon deliver, with cold indifference, a verdict
of survival or—more likely—utter ruin.

ON THAT SAME MORNING, AT EXACTLY 7:20, NOT 7:19 OR
7:21, Jesse Livermore stood at the massive entrance to his 29-room
mansion in King’s Point, Long Island, waiting to see the flying-
maiden hood ornament on his black Rolls-Royce. The chauffeur
knew the drill, he had to enter the driveway at seven twenty. Jesse
Livermore was a precise man.
A light gray fog wafted in from Long Island Sound. It accentu-
ated the cold air, the change of seasons, and added an ominous feel
to the air. As usual, the car rolled down the long circular drive at
precisely 7:20 and stopped in front of Livermore. He nodded
silently to the chauffeur, opened his own door, and slipped into
the back seat, the newspapers folded under his arm. He placed
them on the leather seats as he did every morning:the New York
Times, the London Times, the Wall Street Journal. He glanced at the
headlines again;they were basically all the same—“Stock Markets
Plummet Throughout the World.”
As the car made its way down the driveway, Livermore clicked
on his reading lamp and pulled the side-window curtains closed.
He wanted to study the newspapers in dark silence. There were no
surprises in these newspapers for him. In fact, he had been waiting
for these very headlines for almost a year now. He had planned
carefully for this day, and he had been patient.
When the car crossed into Manhattan, the driver did not drop
the window between them. Instead, he used the microphone.
“Mr. Livermore, we’ve passed into Manhattan. You asked me to
tell you.”
Livermore pushed open the thick black curtain and let the light
of the sun stream into the darkness of the back of the limo. He
thought about telling the chauffeur to drive down to Wall Street so
he could see, could feel, the atmosphere in the Wall Street
canyons.

But that might somehow affect the way he played it from here
on out, affect his emotions, his objectivity. Was this the bottom?
Was it just a pause in a steep decline? Would confidence in the
market return and stop the free fall? Should he cover his short
positions? His fortune would rest on the answers to these ques-
tions, and he had long ago realized that it was what people actually
did in the stock market that counted—not what they said they
were going to do.
Some people might want to see the human chaos, feel the des-
perate financial pandemonium that occurred when the fear-devil
rose up and conquered the greed-god that had appeared so strong
and indestructible—but not Livermore; he wanted to stay
untouched by these human reactions. He would be able to see
everything clearly soon enough. He would listen to the quiet
clicking verdict of the stock tickers in his office suite when the
market opened for trading.
He slid the black curtain back across the window and began to
study the newspapers again in the darkness. He spoke without
looking up. “Harry, we’ll go straight to the office.”
Before the automated traffic-light system was installed, a New
York City police officer would sit in a booth and operate the
lights. When the Livermore limousine approached, this officer
would make sure the light was green so Livermore would have no
interruptions on his journey from King’s Point to his office in
Manhattan.
Once a week, Harry the chauffeur would retrace the route, stop-
ping at each traffic-light booth. There he would pass out a cash gra-
tuity to the police officer in charge for the officer’s kind
consideration in making sure the financier always had a green light
when he passed. Livermore was a person who demanded precision.
Livermore exited his car at 730 Fifth Avenue, the Hecksher

Building. He stepped into the private express elevator that stopped
on the eighteenth floor, the penthouse. Livermore demanded a
straight shot to his office. He chose not to speak with anyone, if he
could avoid it.
There was no name on the door of Livermore’s office suite. He
opened it with his key and entered the small waiting room, an
anteroom where Harry Edgar Dache sat during office hours. It
was difficult to get past Dache, who stood 6 foot 6, weighed 275
pounds, and was considered by the press to be pug-ugly as well as
not very friendly.
At this hour, however, the office suite was empty. Livermore
was always first. He opened the second door with a special key
kept in a safe. Only he and Dache had the combination. Dache
even supervised the cleaning people when they cleaned Liver-
more’s offices. Many considered them the most palatial in New
York City, with hand-carved arches, custom bookshelves, and
walls paneled in beautiful mahogany and carved oak. Livermore
had first seen this paneling in the library of an old English manor
house. He had paid to have the paneling dismantled and shipped to
New York, where it was reassembled in his offices.
The office suite itself consisted of an anteroom; the trading
room with its green chalkboard that covered the entire wall, along
with the walkway for the board men; the conference room; and
finally Livermore’s huge private office. The chalkboard was visible
from all the rooms.
Livermore usually employed a staff of seven, six board men plus
Dache. The primary job of his employees was to post stock quotes
on the green chalkboards that stretched the length of the office area.
Dache oversaw all activities in the office and did whatever else he
was asked. The board men were sworn to secrecy and paid well. The
rule in the offices was no talking during market hours. Livermore

wanted no distractions while the market was open. The quotes had
to be posted immediately and accurately;millions were riding.
There were several ticker-tape machines in each room. The
snaking tape was like the blood that flowed through his veins. It
was life itself. He was never out of arm’s reach of a stock ticker.
There were tickers in the main rooms of all his homes:Lake Placid,
Long Island, the Manhattan apartment, the suite of rooms in the
Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, even on his 300-foot yacht.
Livermore read the numerous New York Times articles that he
had saved from the recent editions. All the papers blamed him for
the calamitous crash, personally blamed him for initiating the
decline—the precipitous free fall which now seemed to have no
bottom. But he believed that business—in his case, the stock mar-
ket—was like war. In war, you died if you made a mistake;in the
stock market, if you made a mistake, you could go broke very fast.
One could die, financially, in a heartbeat.
Livermore was a serious person, and on this day he planned to
do some serious business. He was impeccably dressed, as he was
every day, in a handmade suit from Saville Row in London. His
shirts were the latest style, made of the finest Egyptian cotton,
monogrammed on the cuff. His suit hung perfectly from his slim
frame, his silk tie subtly striped to blend in with it. His blond hair
was combed back, parted on the left side. He used pince-nez
glasses, which were perched on his nose. He wore a vest with a
gold chain that spanned the pockets. On one end of the chain
hung a thin gold pencil, on the other, a small golden penknife. He
often fidgeted with the pen or the knife, spinning one or the other,
while he was talking.
He was the most famous bear on Wall Street, a trader who was
as likely to sell short as to buy long. He didn’t care;he knew that
stocks went down as often as they went up—but when they

declined, they did it twice as fast as when they went up, and that
was what was going on today.
He had a line out at the present time of over a million shares,
well over $100 million. It had been placed months ago, slowly,
secretly, and silently, using more than 100 stockbrokers, so nobody
could tell what he was doing. He was short the market—he had
sold stock that he would later supply, at a much lower price. He
was living up to his reputation as the Great Bear of Wall Street.
Today, he was like a lone wolf stalking the arctic tundra, looking
for prey—and looking out for other predators that might kill him.
There were plenty of Wall Street players he knew who could do
just that—end his financial life with one deadly, hammering blow.
He picked up one of the New York Times articles he had saved
from October 20, and read the headline:“Stocks Driven Down in
Wave of Selling.” He was careful not to gloat. There was no one
who knew better than Livermore how fast things could change in
the stock market. He read on:
In the two hours in which trading was limited on the New
York Stock Exchange active issues passed through one of the
wildest breaks in history. Final quotations revealed net losses
ranging from 5 to 20 points and the aggregate depreciation in
open market values was estimated at $1,000,000,000 (one bil-
lion) or more.
The total turnover was 3,488,100 shares which represented
the second heaviest volume for a Saturday since the Stock
Exchange was established. During the first half hour trading
took place at a rate of more than 8,500,000 shares for a full
five-hour day. The stock market community did not know
until an hour and twenty-three minutes after the 12 o’clock
closing gong what the final prices were, so late was the over-
burdened ticker.

THE GREAT BEAR OF WALL STREET • 7 •
PIVOTAL STOCKS HIT
One of the stories which gained wide circulation wherever
stock market tickers clicked yesterday was that Jesse L. Liver-
more, formerly one of the country’s biggest speculators, is
the leader of the bear clique that has been hammering away
at the market for weeks, and that the particular weakness
which developed in high priced and pivotal stocks was to be
attributed, in part at least, to his activities.
Arthur W. Cutten of Chicago, the recognized leader of the
bull party, watched the ticker from his hotel in Atlantic City
yesterday and told close friends that nothing has developed to
change his opinion about the market—that good stocks
would eventually sell higher.
Reports of a struggle between Livermore and Cutten for
stock market supremacy, which have circulated widely in
Wall Street for the last three or four days, were discredited.
Livermore is presumed to be heavily short of leading stocks
and Cutten heavily long of the same group of issues. The
ascendency of Livermore to the position he once held as the
country’s leading market operator on the bear side, after sev-
eral years of eclipse, is one of the most interesting develop-
ments in the market.
The short selling which it was generally agreed was the
principal factor in today’s decline, served to induce further
liquidation of stocks and the cumulative effect was reflected
in a demoralized market in certain issues. It was plain that the
market was receiving no organized support. Stocks which
ordinarily have powerful backing were allowed to shift for
themselves.
With stocks driving higher during the last few months fol-
lowing each downward reaction, the situation was ready
made for Livermore. The Street stories are that he went short

of a large line of issues such as: United States Steel, Mont-
gomery Ward, Simmons Co., General Electric, American
and Foreign Power and half a dozen other of the market’s
pivotal issues. He then initiated his familiar hammering tac-
tics under which the market first faltered, then broke.
Cutten, the Fishers, Durant and others of the group
known in Wall Street as the “Big Ten” were large holders of
these particular stocks and have seen their plans and pools
wrecked by what were natural economic developments, cou-
pled with much shrewd short selling.
One of the tales started and circulated in the financial dis-
trict yesterday, was that Livermore had the backing in a bear
campaign of Walter P. Chrysler, who was said to be piqued
because he suspected that the Chicago-Detroit group had
hammered at Chrysler motors in the market, driving it down
below 55 from its high of 135 this year.
The outstanding bear leader appears to be Livermore, who
has regained a tremendous fortune through adroit short sell-
ing and who, temporarily at least, is regarded as being exactly
“right” on this market. Cutten, who started as a grain trader,
has amassed an estimated $100 million or more in the stock
market during the last three years of bull markets. Cutten is
the leader of the bull faction and is temporarily at least
regarded as “wrong” on the market.
Mr. Cutten was in New York and watched the market
from the office of the head of the stock exchange. His
expressed opinion to friends is that much of the selling had
been hysterical, and that he believes good stocks should be
held for higher prices. He has not changed his formerly
stated position about the long distance outlook. Neither has
he made any statement about the market for publication.
Naturally they have nothing to say about their market

positions at the moment or what they have been doing in
recent days.
The Times article had more to tell:
Jesse L. Livermore, who has been in eclipse, so far as stock
market operations are concerned, for several years, has made
a smashing comeback, if Wall Street reports are true. The
comeback of Mr. Livermore as one of the foremost market
players is another Wall Street wonder. As a boy he was a board
marker in Boston brokerage houses where he developed such
skill at tape reading that, despite limited capital he was barred
from every bucket shop in Boston and New York. This gave
him the nickname that has stuck to him through later years of
the “Boy Plunger.”
Coming to New York and playing the markets skilfully
after long series of ups and downs he struck an extended win-
ning streak and made a fortune of many millions. It is
reported that in the current bull market he decided that
stocks were too high and guessed wrong. The continued
advances of such issues as General Motors, Steel, General
Electric and others is said to have taken back a large part of
his fortune. He was short of them all and covered time and
time again. It was reported in the financial district that he was
down to his large irrevocable annuities, of which he has sev-
eral for himself and his family, acquired during years of earlier
prosperity.
Arthur Cutten, Livermore’s rival, might be mistaken for a
country storekeeper. He cares nothing for conventions,
appearances or customs. Shy, quiet and unassuming, he has
many times sat back in the corner of a Pullman smoking
room and heard casual travelers discussing his stock market

feats without disclosing his identity. When not attending to
his businesses, he is a gentleman farmer on his estate near
Chicago.
On the other hand, Livermore is the fastidious, well-
dressed man of the city. Slight and blond, and he wears his
dark clothes well, rides in Rolls-Royce cars, maintains a ret-
inue of servants, half a dozen places of residence and proba-
bly the most luxurious offices in New York located atop the
Hecksher Building.
Temperamentally, the two are entirely unlike. Cutten is
calm, slow of speech and not at all impetuous. Livermore is
quick, nervous and excitable, given to superstitions, but will-
ing to bet his last nickel if he thinks he is right. Livermore has
been down not once, but half a dozen times. Cutten at least
in the last years, has typified the bull market.
The markets of the next month or so are likely to prove
wildly exciting affairs, because of the direct pull and haul
against each other of a wide variety of economic factors, all
of them powerful. It is now pretty certain that when stocks
go up, Mr. Cutten will be there helping them along. It is
equally certain that when they decline, Mr. Livermore will be
in the market hammering away. There is however no personal
battle between them.
“Humph, it’s never personal!” uttered Livermore, as he finished
the article and placed it on his desk. He and Cutten had often been
trading adversaries for years now, ever since they had been young
men buying and selling commodities in the Chicago grain pits.
The phone rang, and Livermore signaled to his assistant Dache,
who had just arrived, that he would answer.
“Hello.”
“This Jesse Livermore?”

“Speaking.”
“You bastard, Livermore. This is your doing and you are going
to pay. I’m broke thanks to you. No, I’m more than broke. I owe
my broker thousands of dollars of margin money, but I still got my
gun. I’m headed down there to blow your brains out. Next time
you answer your door I’ll be standing there and the next thing you
know you’ll be walking through the gates of hell, which is where
you deserve to be you . . .”
Livermore slammed the phone down. It all sprang from these
articles, picked up by every paper in the United States, blaming
him for the crash. But it wasn’t him. He wasn’t that powerful;no
one was, not even the men from the great House of Morgan. But
that wouldn’t stop the public from thinking he had triggered the
crash and was driving it down by selling, selling, selling. He had
called the Times and given them an interview explaining that he
was not to blame, but it had not worked. No matter what, it
seemed people wanted to blame him, maybe just so they could
have someone to call on the phone and threaten. He reread the
headline of the interview he had given that appeared in the Octo-
ber 22, 1929 edition of the Times: “Livermore Not in Bear Pool.”
He read on:
Jesse L. Livermore, who has been widely reported in Wall
Street to have been heavily short of the market on the present
break, and to be the leader of a bear pool, denied yesterday
any connection with such a pool.
Mr. Livermore’s statement, issued from his offices at 730
Fifth Avenue, follows:
“In connection with the various reports, which have been
industriously spread during the last few days through the
newspapers and various brokerage houses, to the effect that a
large bear pool has been formed, headed by myself and

financed by various well known capitalists;I wish to state that
there is no truth whatever in any such rumors as far as I’m
concerned, and I know of no such combination having been
formed by others.
“What little business I do in the stock market has only
been as an individual and will continue to be done on such a
basis.
“It is very foolish to think that any individual or combina-
tion of individuals could artificially bring about a decline in
the stock market in a country so large and so prosperous as
the United States. What has happened during the last few
weeks is the inevitable result of a long period of continuous,
rank manipulation of many stock issues causing their prices to
rise many times above their actual worth, based on real earn-
ings and yield returns.
“The men who are responsible for bringing about these
fictitious prices are the same men who are directly responsi-
ble for what is happening in the stock market today. It is
unfortunate for the general public when such a condition
arises that real sound investment issues have to suffer along
with the readjustment of issues of least merit.
“If anyone will take the trouble to analyze the selling prices
of different stocks, as for instance, United States Steel, which
is selling around eight to ten times its current earnings, many
other issues must look, and have looked for a long time, as
selling at ridiculously high prices.
“The Federal Reserve Board through its various warnings
and many expressions from very high banking authorities
could not stop the market from going up, so it must be plain
and seem utterly ridiculous for any sane person to presume
that one lone individual could have any material effect on the
course of the prices of securities.”

“Fools,” Livermore mumbled on finishing the interview.
“Fools, to think I could have brought an entire market to its knees.
Impossible!”
Perhaps he was part of the trigger mechanism, but it was a preg-
nant situation. Wild speculation always brought the market to its
knees. He had been trading for 35 years, since he was 14 years old.
He had made and lost millions of dollars. In 1929, he was at the
height of his power, and he knew this was another moment of
euphoria.
Livermore pondered the situation carefully. The threatening
phone calls had shaken him. He was well aware of the deep psy-
chological wounds that a loss in financial fortune could cause. He
had been through it himself many times in his career. He would
have to make another statement, and quickly—his family could
also be in jeopardy. They had been threatened before.
He waited quietly by the stock ticker that sat on top of his mas-
sive desk. The mahogany desk was clean except for the brass-based
ticker, a single pad of paper, a pencil, and a matching pair of
mahogany in- and out-boxes.
By now, the office was fully staffed. Six markers were up on the
boards, wearing alpaca jackets so they would not smear the chalk
symbols. Each board marker wore earphones and had a mouth-
piece. They were connected directly to the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange. Each had a domain of stocks or commodities to
administer. The ticker began to click, spitting out a strip of paper
like a white snakeskin with perforated scales—the symbols of most
of the companies in the United States. These stock symbols repre-
sented much of the wealth of the country.
For Livermore, reading the ticker tape was like reading the
newspaper. He knew all the symbols by heart, and he had an
exceptional mathematical brain that could remember all the
quotes, just as a good bridge player can remember all the cards that

have been played. To be doubly sure, he watched his board crew as
the markers began to move under Dache’s supervision, filling the
length of the chalkboard with trades. Today, he paid particular
attention to his stock holdings. Livermore could look up at the
board and instantly calculate to the dollar where his overall portfo-
lio stood. There was silence in the office aside from the sounds of
the tickers and the chalk on the boards. There was always silence
in the Livermore trading room when the market was open. There
was no need for idle chatter when the market was open, and all the
board men knew it.
Today Livermore’s total profits plus equity were pushing $100
million.Thisdidnotchangehisexpression.Themainofficephone
rang again. He motioned for Dache not to answer the call. He did
not want to be bothered by another threatening call now that the
market was open. The calls broke his concentration; he had
nothingtosaytoanyone,andhedidnotwanttohearfromanyone.
With the market open he was like a wolf on the prowl. He could
onlyconcentrateonwhathewasdoing.Every1percentmove,up
or down, in his portfolio meant he made or lost $1 million.
The slightest loss of attention could cost him millions of dollars.
It was exactly the way he loved to trade—every fiber of his being
was alive. Nothing else existed but the tape. The tape would tell
him everything if he was smart enough to read it, find the hidden
clues, and act on them. He was fighting the two great emotions of
the stock market:fear and greed. He had a huge bet on the table.
That night he went home to King’s Point and found his wife,
Dorothy, and two sons, Paul and Jesse Jr., gone. The paintings had
been taken down, some of the Persian rugs were gone, and the sil-
ver had disappeared. He went up to the safe on the second floor
where Dorothy kept her jewels—a fabulous collection, mostly
from Harry Winston and Van Cleef and Arpels. All gone.

He went into the kitchen and found the four cooks and two
butlers working, preparing dinner for the family.
“Where are Mrs. Livermore and the boys?” he asked.
“They have moved into the chauffeurs’ apartments sir,” the
main butler answered. “We have all heard about the great crash.
We are very sorry, Mr. Livermore.”
Livermore stared at them for a few seconds, expressionless, and
walked to the apartments above the car stables. There were two
chauffeurs, one for Dorothy, or “Mousie,” as he called her, and
one for himself, or “J.L.,” as he liked to be called. The car stables
were attached to the great stone mansion. He walked into the liv-
ing room of the apartment, stepping over the rolled-up carpets and
around the priceless works of art and antique furniture. Dorothy
sat on the couch with the two boys. They were fully dressed in
their best clothes.
“Mousie, what’s going on? What are you doing?”
“We heard. I’m very sorry, J.L.,” she replied.
“What are you talking about?”
“We heard that everybody has gone broke in the crash. It has
been on the radio all day. Men jumping out of windows, shooting
themselves in their offices, disappearing. Some of my girlfriends
called. I’m so sorry, J.L.”
He looked at her. Long seconds passed. She was beautiful sitting
there with the two handsome boys, one on each side, her jewelry
in a special leather case next to her.
She was his opposite: effusive, full of life, funny, instinctive. A
true social animal who was at her best in the middle of a crowd of
people. She would blurt out whatever was on her mind. She was a
great natural comedian, and the best part was that she did not
make jokes on purpose. In fact, she was often confused as to why
people were laughing.

He looked down at the jewelry case. He had gone to her several
times in his worst moments, his worst defeats in the market. He
had taken that case to Harry Winston more than once when he
was broke and needed a stake. The jewels, worth close to $4 mil-
lion, were always good for a million in cash from Harry, a stake to
start up again. When he went back to retrieve the jewels, after he
was on his feet, he always took care of Harry with a wad of cash.
“Mousie, you and the boys come back to the main house for
dinner. Bring the jewelry case.”
“Oh, J.L., you need them again?”
“No. Today was the best day I ever had in the market. I closed
out half my holdings. We’re going to be fine. I certainly won’t be
needing those jewels. Now, you and the boys come along.”
He turned and walked out, a smile on his face. What a day. She
never failed to surprise him, to make him smile. They were having
personal problems, mostly his fault due to the other women. Nev-
ertheless, he hoped they would make it. He knew that if they
divorced he would miss her very much. His eyes misted as he
thought of their love. Then he shook his head to rid himself of
those thoughts. He would enjoy her and the boys while they were
still with him. Who knew what the future held?
The threatening phone calls stayed with him;more came in as
the days passed. He needed to ward off these threats. He rang up
the New York Times again, a newspaper that was always ready to
quote the secretive Jesse Livermore. The headline of the Novem-
ber 13 edition read: “Livermore Now a Bull: Announces That
Stocks Are Too Far Down and Some Are Sound Bargains.” He
read on:
Jesse L. Livermore, who for many weeks past has been
enlisted on the bear side of the market and is credited with
having sold-short more stocks in this plummeting market

than any other single individual, announced to the New York
Times last night his conviction that the leading stocks had
been driven down too far. Although Mr. Livermore made no
statement as to his own positions his statement left the pre-
sumption that he has covered his shorts and again is on the
buying side of the market.
“Leading stocks with good dividend records and a certain
future are on the bargain counter right now,” declared Mr.
Livermore. “Many of them have been driven down too far.
People throughout the country have become panic stricken
and have thrown their sound securities over without regard to
values. To my mind this situation should go no further. There
is no reason why first-class securities should be ruthlessly
thrown into the market in such fashion as we have seen in the
last few trading days.
We have seen within the last few days large blocks of these
securities thrown on the open market by sellers, many of
whom had no other reason than they had been gripped by
fear.”
But the calls kept coming anyway:“Livermore, you dirty liar. I
know how smart you are. You say you are on the positive side of
the market while you beat the prices down into oblivion. I’m
coming for you. I hope you never get another good night’s sleep,
you miserable bastard.”
And coming:“I’m coming for you. What do I have to lose? I lost
everything in the market, thanks to you and your rotten friends.
You think you can crush the little man, destroy my family and me
with your illegal operation. You are a dead man, you just don’t
know it. My family suffered, now your family is going to suffer!”
And coming: “I lost my house today Mr. Livermore, what do
you think about that? My house that I spent 23 years paying off.

They evicted me today. I’m out on the street like a bum, with my
wife and four kids. You did it, and you’re going to pay for it.”
Nonstop the threats poured in over the phone, in letters, even
in hand-delivered telegrams.
By December 21, 1929, Jesse Livermore had had enough. He
hired his old friend Frank Gorman, a former Nassau County
police officer, as a precaution. Gorman and Livermore were old
friends by 1929. Livermore had used him several times in the past
when things had gotten hairy. The last time, he had employed
Gorman to protect him from “Boston Billy” Monaghan a notori-
ous thief who had robbed Livermore’s mansion, been caught, and
sworn revenge.
Gorman immediately moved into the King’s Point mansion. He
accompanied the boys to school every day and became Dorothy’s
shadow.
Livermore maintained his routine, going in to the office every
day and watching the tape, making his moves. One afternoon, Liv-
ermore walked to the window and pulled open the drapes. The
view took in the bustling metropolis that was New York City in
the early days of 1930. As the ticker tape slid unattended between
his fingers, carrying its endless quotations—all negative, like casu-
alty lists from a battlefield—he looked out.
He wondered how his life had come to this point. And he won-
dered why he was not happier. After all, these had been the days of
his greatest financial success.

• 20 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
JESSE LIVERMORE WAS BORN ON JULY 26, 1877, IN SHREWS-
bury, Massachusetts. His parents were Laura and Hiram Livermore.
Livermore’s father was a poor farmer who tried to plow a living
out of the unforgiving New England soil. Hiram Livermore lost
his first farm early in Jesse’s life, and the family moved to Paxton,
Massachusetts, to live with Jesse’s grandfather. Hiram eventually
saved enough money to buy some farm property in South Acton.
Livermore quickly learned what it was like to farm the rock-
filled fields of New England. Picking up large rocks the plow
brought up was his first job. Scraping out a living on a small patch
of land in Massachusetts was tough, backbreaking work that
yielded small rewards in turn-of-the-century America.
As a boy, Livermore was slender, slight, and often sick. This lead
to a lot of reading, especially of the few newspapers and magazines
that he could get his hands on. He devoured any available books
and escaped into the theater of the mind that they opened for him.
He was imaginative and intelligent, able to use deductive rea-
soning to arrive at logical conclusions. It did not take him long to
conclude that his boyhood dreams of success and adventure could
not be built out of punishing New England farm life.
Livermore’s father was a distant, reserved man who did not show
affection easily. He ruled the household with a hard-edged, no-
nonsense attitude toward life. Livermore’s mother was the oppo-
site—loving and gentle, with plenty of time for her gifted boy.
At school, Livermore excelled in mathematics. He could finish
equations in his head and just give the answers, or find an alterna-
tive way to solve the problems given to the class. Once, he chal-
lenged a teacher to a race to solve a complex math problem. He
won. He was quickly promoted in math and given more advanced
courses to satisfy his yearning to learn more.
Mathematics was his friend;it came easily to him. He did three
years’ worth of arithmetic schoolwork in only one year. He could

keep multitudes of numbers in his head, forming patterns. The
numbers always yielded to his computerlike brain.
When Livermore was 13, his father explained that education
was unnecessary, useless for a simple farmer’s life. At the age of 14,
Livermore’s father yanked him out of school and handed him
overalls. His father explained that he was going to be a full-time
farmer and was obliged to contribute to the family welfare.
But Livermore was smarter. He appeared to comply with his
father’s wishes, but he actually conspired with his mother to escape.
Within weeks—with $5 supplied by his mother in his pocket—he
sneaked off the farm and hailed a wagon on the road headed for
Boston. He knew it was the right thing to do. He needed to set out
into the world and make his fortune. While he had no specific plan,
he knew he was moving in the right direction.
He was still only 14 when he reached Boston and, with it, the
adult world, but his life patterns were already programmed, burned
into his brain. He realized the value of hard work. He had the tac-
iturn, quiet strength and determination of so many New England-
ers—people who were used to dealing with hard, unyielding soil,
unforgiving weather, and financial maelstroms.
His image of men was based on his father:silent, hard-working,
stubborn, distant, unemotional, determined, noncommunicative,
and supreme dictators of the household. His image of women was
based on his mother and the few girls that he had met at school:
gentle, nurturing, intelligent, emotional, and loving. He also knew
that women seemed to like him, and they were always good to him.
He realized, even at 14, that success, wealth, and fame could
come directly from working with the brain, not the body. He also
realized that it was action that counted, not talk—this he had
learned from his father.
But it was his mother who had given him the meager finances
he needed to break for Boston and a new life. He would repay her

with great interest, just as soon as he could. Paying one’s debts was
already ingrained in him, and it is something he did all his life, no
matter how long it took.
When Livermore entered Boston at the ripe old age of 14, his
life was just beginning, but he would never forget the lessons he
had already learned in his youth. Now, however, he needed to
concentrate on his future. He confined his mother and father to a
compartment of his brain, then locked that compartment tight.
He could stand no distractions if he was to succeed. This ability to
park his emotions, to compartmentalize, came naturally to him.
He could function no matter what the condition of his emotional
life. He fought all his life to keep his business and personal lives
completely separate. And he almost succeeded.
At 14, he was blond, blue-eyed, slender and intelligent, with a
quick flashing smile of perfect white teeth. His confidence was
rock solid.
He slipped off the wagon in Boston and stood outside the Paine
Webber offices for a moment, taking them in, before entering. He
watched as the customers came and went. The stock tickers
clicked and spit endless white trails of paper tape. The board boys
moved up and down the room-length green chalkboard, like
dancers on the stage. They posted stock prices as fast as the stock
caller, often a customer sitting in the gallery watching the tape,
could yell the current quotes at them.
The customers sat in chairs against the walls, frantically watch-
ing the chalkboard, occasionally rising to go to their brokers as
though they were placing bets in a horse room. Livermore inhaled
all the action:the clicking of the tickers, the clatter of chalk on the
boards, and people talking loudly, excitedly. All the movement and
action thrilled him. His fingers tentatively touched the glass globe
of the stock ticker;it was both warm and cool to his hand. It was
like a crystal ball, except if you could read its fortune you would

be as rich as Croesus, the richest man in the world. He watched.
People were getting rich every second based on what that imper-
sonal tape said. He did not think about losing.
The office smelled good to him, heady, with its aroma of wood,
chalk, paper and ink, of human excitement and energy, coffee
brewing, and food being eaten at desks. He liked the juice—the
excitement—from the second he walked into the Boston office of
Paine Webber.
He was already a long way from the farm.
He was wearing a suit that was slightly too big for him. His
mother had bought it large so he could grow into it. He found the
manager, took a deep breath, and tapped him on the shoulder. The
manager was a man in his late 40s. He looked at Livermore and
saw a farm lad, a country bumpkin.
“Whadda you want, kid?” he asked, looking him over.
“A job.”
“You any good with numbers?”
“Yes.”
“See them kids up on the walkway postin’ the numbers?”
“Yes.”
“Well, we’re short one chalkboard boy. A no-show.” He stud-
ied Livermore. “You a no-show kinda kid? You gonna let me
down?”
“No sir. I’ll show.”
“Alright.” He smiled. “I’ll give ya a shot, kid. I started that way
myself, a chalkboard boy.”
“Yes sir,” Livermore answered.
“And look at me now, 25 years later, I’m the boss around here.
Don’t you ever forget that this is America, kid, where anybody can
do anything they set their mind to. Now, I can’t stand here blab-
berin’ with you all day. I gotta make some money. You want the

“Yes sir.”
“Alright. Take off your big brother’s jacket, kid, and get up
there on the walkway.”
“I don’t have a big brother.”
“I don’t care whether you do or you don’t. I was only ribbin’
you, kid, ’cause your jacket’s so big. Get up there now. Ain’t you
ever been ribbed?”
The manager watched as young Livermore shed his coat and
climbed the ladder to the walkway. He was immediately handed a
piece of chalk by one of the other boys.
“Here, kid, take this.” The boy also handed him an alpaca
office-coat.
“Kid? You call me a kid? You’re only a kid yourself.”Livermore
said.
“Not up here on this walkway, I ain’t no kid. I been doing this
for four years.” He smiled.
“Hey kid,” the manager yelled at Livermore.
“Yes?” Livermore answered, fearful that he had already changed
his mind about the job.
“You never asked me about the pay.”
“What’s the pay?” Livermore answered.
“Six bucks a week,” the manager replied. “And kid, don’t do
that again—always negotiate. Don’t just take what the guy offers
you. I mighta went to seven bucks. I mean, I gave you a clue. I told
you I was short a boy. You gotta take it when you can in this world.
Negotiate.”
“Yes sir.”
The manager winked at him and went back to work.
Livermore had been in Boston for less than an hour. He had
gotten a job and a free lesson in negotiating, and he had already
decided to buy himself a suit that fit. He did not like being insulted
about the way he dressed.

THE BACK STORY • 25 •
Livermore found himself a room with board near the Paine
Webber offices. He was up at the crack of dawn every day and was
always the first one to the offices, often waiting for the manager to
arrive with the office key. He loved everything about his job.
Being a chalkboard boy was like going to stock market college. He
was privy to everything in the office. In the beginning it was all
Greek to him, but every day something new was revealed, and he
knew that if he could someday break the code and develop a sys-
tem of trading, he would be rich.
Young Livermore had access to everything:talk from the bro-
kers, from customers with tips, and from customers who played
the tout sheet tacked to the bulletin board every morning. Cre-
ative theories on trading were explained to him in the dull times,
on his breaks, and at lunch. The office was consumed with one
thing, making money from the actions of the stock market. Every-
one there was a player. Livermore and the other kids were an
important part of it. They were moving up and down the walkway,
posting the actual trades on the chalkboard.
The action on the board would become one of the keys to his
later success. He quickly learned that it was never what the bro-
kers, or the customers, or the newspapers said—the only thing that
was important was what the tape said. He also observed that the
tape’s pronouncements very rarely matched what the brokers or
the customers had predicted. The tape had a life of its own, and its
was the most important life. Its verdict was final.
He loved the actual physical job of writing the quotes on the
chalkboard because he had a photographic memory when it came
to numbers. His memory for numbers was perfect—the yelling of
the quotes from the ticker could not come quick enough for Liv-
ermore. He never fell behind in posting the quotes, no matter
how fast they came. They racked up in his brain like stacked cord-
wood.

Eventually, he started to see repeating patterns come alive in
the numbers. At night, alone in his room, he would write out the
numbers for several issues from memory. He started keeping
a numerical diary, and certain recurring numerical patterns
emerged. He noticed that the numbers moved in consistent waves,
often in smooth repeating trends. When the price of a stock
started to go upward, or downward, it usually remained in that
trend until some pressure caused it to reverse. The clues to this
action were often in the numerical patterns.
“Stocks act in line with the laws of physics,” he thought. “A
body in motion tends to stay in motion, until a force or obstacle
stops or changes that motion.” He kept logs tracking the stocks for
longer periods, and then he had another revelation: There were
patterns within the patterns, and even larger patterns emerged.
He kept the diary in secret and discussed his observations with
no one. He was secretive by nature. He had ultimate confidence
in his mathematical ability, even at the age of 14. Besides, he was
too busy posting the numbers and watching the action of the
market on the chalkboard to engage in idle chatter during busi-
ness hours.
Because he was working the chalkboard—listening for the
shouted quotes, erasing prices, writing in new numbers hundreds
of times a day, thousands of times a week—he learned to be inter-
ested only in the change in price, not the reasonfor the change. He
had no time to waste trying to rationalize the action of the stock.
There could be a million reasons why the price had changed.
These reasons would be revealed later, after the fact. But by the
time these reasons were understood, the change would already be
a historical event, and it would be too late to make any money.
His notebook was neat, well-written, and precisely accurate. At
15, he began to look for repeating patterns, searching for a system,

trying to identify natural mathematical laws that were operating
within the market.
He had also observed that the majority ofthe people in the office
lost money. These people seemed to be acting randomly. They had
no plan, no consistent, reasoned approach to the market. They
were just gambling, just like at the track, just playing hunches. One
day they would play the favorites, the next day the long shots or the
jockeys;or they would buy a tout sheet and play the recommenda-
tions of the tipster—random-action stock picking.
These were heady days for Livermore. He was loving every
minute of his life in the markets. And he was getting paid for it!
After six months of doing his job every day, eventually making a
series of paper bets in his notebook and keeping track of them, he
was still missing a crucial part of the equation, and he knew it. He
had yet to buy his first stock. He knew that unless he actually pur-
chased a stock, he could never know how he would handle himself.
Like a gambler who has never made a wager, it was only talk and
speculation until he slapped his money down. When a trader made a
bet everything changed, and he knew it. Then and only then did the
trader enter the heated jungle of emotions. He knew that he would
always have his intellect under control, and it was a strong one. What
he did not know was whether he could control his emotions.
He had watched the customers at the Paine Webber office, and
he knew it would be his emotions that would make or break
him—particularly greed and fear, the two devil-emotions of the
market. You either controlled them or they controlled you.
The time had come for Livermore to buy a stock, but he had
very little money. Where could he buy a stock cheaply?
Livermore would later marry and have two sons, Jesse Jr. and
Paul. He recounted to them, on many occasions, where he found
cheap stocks:the bucket shops.

Nov. 6, 1928—In a darkened hospital room at the edge of
Hell’s Kitchen on the West Side of Manhattan, the king of
easy money lay dying. Through the shadows that drifted slowly
across his mind he could hear a weary voice repeating the same
question again and again. “Who did it, Mr. Rothstein?” the
voice asked in a disinterested, mechanical way. “Who shot
you?” But Rothstein would not tell. His only response was to
slowly turn his face to the wall and whisper:“If I live, I’ll tend
to it.”Then he closed his eyes and faded away.”
—William Klingaman,
1929:The Year of the Great Crash
Arnold Rothstein, known in underworld circles as “the Brain,”
was a genius with money. He started out as a gambler, but after a
fantastic string of successes, he became an underworld king and
lived like it. He was accused of many crimes, among them fixing
the 1919 “Black Sox” World Series. His fortune was vast. His
financial tentacles reached into every vein of American vice.
Among Rothstein’s many holdings were most of the bucket
shops in the major cities of the United States. A bucket shop
looked like a broker’s office. It had a gallery for the customers, a
chalkboard to record the stock quotes, and an active stock ticker
spewing out the daily trades on an almost instantaneous basis. But
it was more like a horse-betting parlor than a true broker’s office.
At a bucket shop, traders could play the market on 10 percent mar-
gin. In other words, traders needed to have only 10 percent of the
price of the stock they wanted to buy. The rules were simple:Put
up 10 percent and make a bet by buying a stock. A ticket with the
buy number would immediately be printed and given to the pur-
chaser. This ticket would indicate the time, the price paid for the
stock purchased, and the number of shares purchased. The pur-
chaser would watch the quotes, and as soon as the stock lost 10

percent of its value, the shop moved in and quickly swept away
the money. Conversely, if the stock price went up and the trader
won, the trader went up to a clerk who marked the ticket stub
with the price of the last trade on the stock ticker. Then the trader
went to the cage window to collect the money. It was a sucker’s
play—the house won 95 percent of the time.
Most important for the functioning of the bucket shop, the
money spent to buy the stock was never sent to the floor of the
exchange. It was simply bookedby the bucket shop;the bucket shop
would hold the bet, like a bookie. Bucket-shop action was quick
and fierce. Traders could buy as few as five shares or as many as the
house could cover—thousands of dollars worth.
Because Livermore had no capital, no stake, it was inevitable
that he would enter the bucket shops, a world controlled by the
crime bosses. It was only a matter of when and how.
In 1892, when Livermore was 15 years old, his friend Billy,
another board-crew kid, approached him. “Jesse, you got any
money?”
“I’m eating my lunch.’
“Never mind your lunch. You got any money?”
“Why?”
“I got a tip on Steel. I need somebody to go in with me.”
“How you gonna play it, Billy?” Livermore asked.
“Bucket shop. I’ll run over and make the play during lunch.”
“How much you need?”
“I need five bucks. I wanna buy five shares of U.S. Steel. It’s sell-
ing at ten dollars.”
“Just a minute.” Livermore reached into his pocket and pulled
out his notepad.
“What’s with the notepad?” Billy asked.
“I’m reading my horoscope for today,”Livermore answered. He
checked the history of the trading figures on U.S. Steel in his

notepad. The numbers were moving in the same pattern as they
usually moved before the stock went up. He was satisfied they had
a good chance. “Okay.”
He handed his friend the money. Two days later he smiled as he
pocketed his winnings—a pure profit of more than $3. Livermore
was in the game. He was finally a player.
Livermore started to visit the bucket shops on his own, always
checking his notepad for the exact price quotes of the stocks he
followed, looking for patterns. He had developed a system and he
stuck to it. He played both sides of the market, going long if his
numbers told him to do so, or jumping on the short side if his
numbers pointed to the downside. It made no difference to him.
Soon he was making more money at the shops than he was at his
job. So he quit and played the market in the Boston bucket shops
full time. Before he was 16, he had well over $1,000 in cash. He
went home for a visit. His mother was ecstatic to have her son
home;his father just shook his head in wonderment. How could a
boy of 16 legally lay his hands on over $1,000 in cash?
Livermore gave half his winnings to his parents, paying back his
mother. He returned to Boston with a line of over $750 and con-
tinued with what would be his life’s work. He worked alone, never
telling anyone what he was doing, never taking on a partner, never
borrowing money. He moved from bucket shop to bucket shop so
as not to draw attention to himself. This lone-wolf strategy served
him well, and it fit his personality. He would act this way all his
life—buying alone and in secret, selling alone and in secret, telling
no one. His true thrill came from being right—using his brain to
win, not his brawn, not his connections, not his powers of persua-
sion—just using pure brain power to figure out what few men
could figure out: how to make money in the stock market. The
thrill came from the winning, not the money, though the money
was nice. The money always came if his judgment was right.

THE BACK STORY • 31 •
It was at this young age that Livermore earned the nickname
“Boy Plunger,” based on his youthful looks and large bucket-shop
bets.
Just as a gambler who was a consistent winner would be barred
from a casino, Livermore was finally barred from the bucket shops
of Boston after his winnings had piled up. All the bucket-shop
proprietors knew who the Boy Plunger was and what he looked
like. He tried changing his name and wearing disguises, but they
quickly saw through the deception. He tried a new strategy:losing
at first and then making a big move at the end of his play. This
worked only for a brief time, always ending in being told to get
out and take his business elsewhere.
Livermore was killing the bucket shops. At first they had
thought he was just a kid, what could he know? But soon the
bucket-shop managers found out exactly how much he did know,
right in their cash-boxes. The supreme boss in most cases was
Arnold Rothstein, and he kept a close eye on his businesses. The
managers had their own skins to look out for. Livermore, now
banned from the bucket shops in Boston, took his theories, his sys-
tem, and his stock-buying principles to the great city of New York
in hopes of playing the bucket shops there. Unfortunately for Liv-
ermore, the New York Stock Exchange and the police had suc-
cessfully shut down all the New York bucket shops. So Livermore
would have to find new hunting grounds.
He figured that the same principles, the same system, would
work in the major brokerage houses. He was sure his theories
would hold up.
He was wrong.
He arrived in Manhattan with $2,500. His Boston bucket-shop
stake had, at times, been over $10,000, but he had suffered a few
reversals before leaving Boston for New York. These reversals
bothered Livermore, so he analyzed what had happened. He never

blamed the market. It was illogical to get angry at an inanimate
object, like a gambler getting mad at a deck of cards. He always
wanted to learnfrom his mistakes and thereby profitfrom those mis-
takes. There was no arguing with the tape. The tape was always
right; it was the players who were wrong. He reviewed his bad
trades, and the conclusions became clear to him.
His first conclusion was that he won when all the factors were
in his favor, when he was patient and waited for all the ducks to
line up in a row. That led him to his second conclusion, that no
one could or should trade the market all the time. There were
times when a trader should be out of the market, in cash, waiting.
Years later, his friend Bernard Baruch would reaffirm this early
conclusion. Baruch would occasionally say, “J.L., I think it’s time
to go grouse shooting.” Baruch would then sell out all his posi-
tions and go to the famed Hobcaw Barony, his 17,000-acre plan-
tation in South Carolina. Its sandy beaches and salt marshes once
offered the finest duck hunting in the United States—and no tele-
phone.
Livermore, 20 years old, was in New York with some cash in his
pocket, but without access to a bucket shop. So he entered the
game on the Big Board, the New York Stock Exchange. He settled
on working out of the offices of E. F. Hutton. The people at Hut-
ton liked him, and his winning bucket-shop reputation preceded
him. On respectable Wall Street, his nickname was transformed
from “Boy Plunger” to “Boy Trader.” With so small a stake, he
could hardly expect to be a plunger among the big players.
At first he did well and ran up some good commissions for the
brokers, but he eventually went broke. It took six months of hard
work for him to bust out. Ultimately, he actually wound up on the
wrong side of the ledger. He owed the broker money.
Disgusted with himself, he went to see E. F. Hutton one
evening after the market closed.

“I need a loan, Ed,” he said.
“How much?” Hutton asked.
“A thousand dollars.”
“I’ll just give you a credit in your account for a thousand.”
“No, I want a loan.”
“Why?”
“I can’t beat Wall Street right now. I’m going back to the bucket
shops. I need a stake, then I’ll be back.”
“I don’t get it,” Hutton said. “You can beat the bucket shops,
but you can’t beat Wall Street. How’s that?”
“First off, when I buy or sell a stock in a bucket shop, I do it off
the tape. When I do it with your firm, it’s ancient history by the
time my order hits the floor. If I buy it at, say, 105, and the order
gets filled at 107 or 108, I’ve lost the comfort margin and most of
my play. In the bucket shop, if I buy it off the tape, I immediately
get the 105. The same is true when I want to sell short, especially
on an active stock where the trading is heavy. In the bucket shop,
I put my sell order in at, say, 110, and it gets filled at 110, but here
it might get filled at 108. So I’m getting it from both sides.”
“But we give you better margins than the bucket shops,” Hut-
ton said.
“And that Ed, is what really killed me. See, with the extra mar-
gin from you I could stay with a stock—not like the bucket shop,
where a ten percent move wiped me out. See, the point is that I
wanted the stock to, let’s say, go up, and it goes down. Holding on
to it longer is bad for a trader like me, because I was betting it
would go up. I can afford to lose the ten percent but I can’t afford
twenty-five percent on margin. I have to make too much back to
get my money back.”
“So, all you could ever lose in the bucket shops was the ten per-
cent because they would sell you out?”
“Yes, and it turns out that was a blessing. All I ever want to lose

in any one stock is ten percent,” Livermore said. “Now, will you
lend me the money?”
“One more question.” Hutton smiled. He liked this young
man. This young man was a force to be reckoned with, a mental
force. “Why do you think you can come back here next time and
beat the market?”
“Because I will have a new trading system by then. I consider
this part of my education.”
“How much did you come here with, Jesse?”
“Twenty-five hundred dollars.”
“And you leave with a borrowed thousand,” Hutton said,
reaching into his wallet, extracting the thousand in cash, and hand-
ing it to Livermore. “For thirty-five hundred dollars, you could
have gone to Harvard.”
“I’ll make a lot more money with my education here than I ever
would going to Harvard,” Livermore said, smiling as he took the
money.
“Somehow, I believe you, Jesse.”
“I’ll pay this back,” Livermore said, pocketing the money.
“I know you will. Just remember when you come back, do your
trading here. We like your business.”
“Yes sir, that I will,” Livermore said.
Ed Hutton watched him leave. There was no question in his
mind that he would see him again.
Livermore’s options for bucket-shop trading were limited. The
East Coast was closed off to him, so he looked to middle America.
He headed for Saint Louis, where he had heard of two huge
bucket-shop operations.
He took the train, arrived in Saint Louis, checked into a hotel,
showered, and headed for the first bucket shop. It was a large oper-
ation, with a trading gallery that held more than 200 people. He
started slow, using a false name and playing conservatively. He

traded for three days until he was singled out. He had built his
$1,000 stake up to $3,800.
On the morning of the third day, he was called into the boss’s
office and greeted with, “Hello, Mr. Jesse Livermore. Sit down.”
They had recognized him. He was told that he was banned from
that bucket shop, to leave immediately.
He quickly went down to the next bucket shop, only a block
away. He went up to the window and made his play.
“Fifteen hundred shares of BRT.”
The clerk had just started to fill out the slip when the manager
came up and stood in front of Livermore. “Your money’s no good
in here. We ain’t the suckers here on this side ofthe cage, the suck-
ers are on your side of the cage, Livermore.”
“You know my name?”
“And your game.” He handed the money back to Livermore.
“Listen . . .”
“No, you listen. You think I didn’t just get a call from down the
street about you? Now, I’m only gonna ask you one more time
nice. Get the hell outta here!”
“Get outta here doesn’t sound to me like you’re asking,” Liver-
more replied, taking back his money.
The next day he took the train back to New York. He visited
E. F. Hutton’s office. He handed back the $1,000 he had borrowed.
“You want interest?” Livermore asked with a smile.
“I’ll get my interest out of your commissions. That didn’t take
long. Did they make you?”
“Yeah, they nailed me within four days.”
“How’d you do?”
“Not great. I’m about right back where I was when I walked in
here six months ago.”
“So it’s Harvard or Wall Street again, huh?”
“No, it’s Wall Street or nothing.”

“How could you have a new system to beat Wall Street in four
days?” Hutton asked.
“I don’t have to beat Wall Street. I have to beat myself, my emo-
tions.”
“That’s the smartest thing I’ve heard from you yet, Jesse. Good
luck.”
“Luck?”
“Yes, Jesse, we all need a little luck in this life. Now let’s reopen
your account.”
Livermore traded for several months. But when he summarized
his account, he found that he had only broken even. His confidence
remained high, but he still had not established a consistent winning
system for playing the market as he had with the bucket shops.
Then one day a fellow named Bill Sullivan walked into the E. F.
Hutton offices and told Livermore that the man who ran the Saint
Louis bucket shop had made a killing on a racetrack scheme and
moved to the East Coast. To avoid the New York City police he
had opened a new bucket-shop operation in Hoboken, New Jer-
sey, just across the river. Sullivan told Livermore that it was a no-
limit house. There was no limit to the amount of stock a trader
could buy or sell.
Livermore waited for Saturday to roll around before he visited
the Hoboken bucket shop. On Saturdays the market was open
only until 12. Inside the shop, the setup was very grand, with a full
quotation board, a customer’s gallery, and plenty of clerks for ser-
vice. Livermore acted dumb and placed a few early orders. Then,
at a little past 11, he laid down $2,000 in cash and went short on
$20,000 worth of stock. The stocks plummeted, and just five min-
utes before the close he covered the shorts and cashed in. His profit
was $6,000. He went to collect, but the clerk did not have enough
cash to fully pay out. He was told to return on Monday for the rest
of his money.

On Monday he showed up. Waiting for him was the same man
he had last seen in Saint Louis.
“Livermore, what do you want?”
“My money.”
“I told you never to trade in my establishment when you were
in Saint Louis. This is New Jersey, and I don’t want you trading in
here, either. There’s no money waitin’ for you here this Monday
morning.”
“Give me my money,” Livermore intoned.
The man looked at him for a few long seconds.
“Hey, at least I’m playing an honest game, not like your race-
track escapades,” Livermore continued, staring back. “If you want
to trade in this part of the country, you better pay me.”
A crowd had now gathered behind Livermore. He repeated, “I
want my money. I played fair and square.”
“You were banned.”
“Not here in Hoboken. Now, give me my money!”
The man finally nodded and the clerk peeled off some $1,000
bills until Livermore had his money, the full $6,000.
“Livermore, I have a boss, a very unforgiving boss. So do me a
favor and don’t come back in here.”
Livermore looked him in the eye, nodded and walked out. He
put his money in his pocket and thought about the situation on his
ride back to Manhattan.
The next day he called Bill Sullivan, the man who had told him
of the bucket shop. “Listen Bill, thanks for the tip on that place in
Hoboken. I need you to do me a little favor.”
“How little?” Sullivan asked.
“I’ll bankroll you, and I want you to go to Hoboken and make
some small plays. Then when the time is right, I’ll give you the
word.”
“What’s my cut?”

“Twenty percent plus expenses, and I’ll give you a thousand
dollars for a bankroll.”
“Deal, Livermore.”
Livermore waited until Sullivan was established and then made
his move. He went short and cleaned up a net of $4,100 after pay-
ing the 20 percent cut and expenses.
Livermore now had a stake of over $10,000, and he decided to
stick strictly to the stock market in the future—no more bucket
shops. He was banned for good now, and sooner or later, Arnold
Rothstein, the Brain, would step into the picture and pay him a
visit.If thathappened,hewouldbeluckytokeephislife,letalone
anymoneyhehadmade.Besides,hehadhisstakeback,biggerthan
ever. Now it would be up to him to use it in the stock market.
Besides, he was tired of playing for small points in bucket shops.
He liked playing in a bigger game, a legitimate game, through
licensed brokers, where there was no limit on the money a trader
could make—or lose, as he would find out.
It would become the never-ending challenge of Livermore’s
life: beating the market. Beating the market was like alchemy—
changing lead into gold. The market changed paper into gold and
created fortunes beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. The market was
where $100 became $1,000, $1,000 became $1 million, and $1
million became $100 million. All the trader had to do was call the
moves before they occurred—and, as with any great puzzle, the
answer was always right there. All the trader had to do was figure
it out.
And Livermore remained confident that he could find the
answer to the puzzle.

THE SPECULATOR
Modern usage has made the term speculator a synonym for
gambler and plunger. Actually the word comes from the Latin
speculari, which means to spy out and observe.
I have defined a speculator as a man who observes the future
and acts before it occurs. To be able to do this successfully—and
it is an ability of priceless value in all human affairs—three
things are necessary:
First, one must get the facts of a situation or problem.
Second, one must form a judgement as to what those facts
portend.
Third, one must act in time, before it is too late.
I have heard many men talk intelligently—even bril-
liantly—about something only to see them proven powerless
when it comes to acting on what they believe. If action is de-
layed until the need is apparent to everyone, it will be too late.
To be evident to all, a danger must be on top of us and out
of hand. My Own Story, Bernard Baruch

LIVERMORE STUDIED HIS MISTAKES OBJECTIVELY. IN LATER
years, he often told his sons that “the only way you get a real edu-
cation in the market is to invest cash, track your trade, and study
your mistakes!”
It is emotionally difficult to review your mistakes, since the
speculator must wade through his own bad trades and blunders.
And these are not simple blunders, these are blunders that cost
money. Anyone who has lost money by investing poorly knows
how difficult it is to reexamine what occurred.
The examination of a losing trade is torturous but necessary to
ensure that it will not happen again. Livermore was brutal in self-
analysis. He told his sons his conclusion: “Successful trading is
always an emotional battle for the speculator, not an intellectual
battle. It is only after a bet has been placed on a stock or a com-
modity, when the money has changed from cash in hand to stock
certificates, that the emotions spring to life.”
Livermore equated speculators who traded imaginary stock
positions with someone who was a crack shot on the pistol range.
How would such a crack shot do in a duel, facing an opponent’s
loaded pistol? That was when fear raised its ominous head, nerves
frayed and split, resolve was challenged, and reason fled.
To speculate, a trader had to be a player, not a theorist, or an
economist, or an analyst. A speculator had to be a player with
money down on the table. It was not the coach or the team’s
owner who won the game, it was the players on the field—just as
itwasnotthegeneralswhowonthebattle,itwasthegruntsonthe
ground.
For Livermore, the richest gold mine on the planet was sitting
high on the bedrock of Manhattan—the New York Stock
Exchange at the corner ofWall and Broad Streets. It looked easy—
no exploring necessary, no maps, no staking a claim. It was open

at certain hours, and it invited everyone into the mine to try their
luck. But very few miners walked out with a pot of gold.
The same facts were available to all the prospectors at the same
time. So failures to mine the mountain properly were personal fail-
ures, since everyone basically started out even. But the problems
were in many ways the same as those in hunting for gold, as well.
There were false clues, fool’s gold, dry holes, bad climatic condi-
tions, corrupt partners, dance-hall girls, gunfighters, and professional
gamblers. And two of the biggest problems were claim jumpers and
scallywags who wanted to scam miners out of their gold by trying
to buy their claims cheaply or sell them fraudulent maps.
These scallywags, in Livermore’s mind, manifested on Wall
Street as tipsters. They stood at the entrance to the great gold mine
and sold their wares. These hucksters handed out tips to the unini-
tiated before the uninitiated even got a chance to dig for the gold
themselves. An easy road to success is what they promised—hit the
mother lode fast, with no work.
Livermore noticed that the novices never asked the simple ques-
tions:
• Why have you chosen me to receive this priceless advice?”
• If you have this information, then why aren’t you rich?
• What is driving you to give me this advice to buy a stock?
Are you secretly selling it to me at higher and higher prices?”
• If capital gains are so easy to make, then why are you only
interested in your commissions?
There were many pitfalls on the road to successful speculation,
and Livermore knew he was destined to fall into them all. But he
was not so much worried about falling into the pits as he was wor-
ried about falling into them over and over and over again.

Livermore knew the basic laws of the market, as did everyone:
• When you are wrong there is one thing that cannot be
denied—you lose money.
• When you are right, you make money.
• Therefore, you are right only when you make money and
wrong only when you lose it. This law cannot be denied, and
it is the true law of speculation.
Over his career, Livermore observed that many people jaw-
boned about the market, as if talking could reverse their fortunes,
or the pain of failing to adhere to the basic laws of speculation
would be less if they commiserated with other people. It was one
of the reasons Livermore was always silent about his trades. If he
won, well, then he had done the right thing. If he lost, he had
done the wrong thing. Why complain? Why explain?
His only quest in the analysis of his trades was to find out why
he had made money or why he had lost.
For Livermore, life in the market was as the poet Omar
Khayyám said in the Rubaiyat:
The moving finger writes
And having writ moves on
Nor all your piety nor your wit
Can cancel out a word of it
Nor your tears wash away a line
It was 1899, two years before the beginning of the twentieth cen-
tury. Livermore was 22, he had $10,000 to trade with, and he had
seven years of experience to lean on. He knew by now that the
stock market was not the same as playing the bucket shops, but he

had beaten the bucket shops. There was no reason why he could
not beat the stock market as well.
He reopened his account at E. F. Hutton as he had promised he
would. He traded more cautiously this time, but still followed his
old principle of trading for the short term, following the tape on
an almost hourly or daily basis. He started to do better. He lived
well and made friends.
In October 1900, he married Nettie Jordan, an Indianapolis girl
whom he had met in his Midwestern bucket-shop days. He and
Nettie lived in the upscale Windsor Hotel on Fifth Avenue. In the
summers, Livermore rented them a cottage at Long Branch, New
Jersey, on the ocean. He made his first trip to Europe with Nettie
during this period, where he purchased more than $12,000 worth
of jewelry for her.
Then all hell broke lose in 1901, with a great boom in the mar-
ket. A bull market developed. America was very prosperous, and
the market started to boil—the old record of 250,000 shares traded
in a day was broken by a 3-million-share day. Millionaires in steel,
finance, and railroads moved to New York to be near the action.
Big-shot gamblers ready to put their money where their mouth
was came, too. The turn of the century was an exciting time to be
alive.
The legends of Wall Street abounded, some of them great char-
acters who would live forever in Wall Street history:John “Bet-a-
Million” Gates, John A. Drake, Loyal Smith Page, and the
infamous Hetty Green, Wall Street’s first female powerhouse.
Hetty Green stood alone. As recorded in Kenneth L. Fisher’s
book, 100 Minds That Made the Market, she was as shrewd as they
came, turning her $6 million inheritance into more than $100 mil-
lion. She was also as cheap as they came, wearing foul-smelling,
never-cleaned, black, out-of-fashion dresses with stock certificates

sewn into the hems. Every day she appeared, a black apparition,
drifting from the slum-level flats she owned to the Chemical
National Bank vault. She would plop down cross-legged on the
floor, then clip coupons and stuff them down into the hem of her
dress, all the while eating sandwiches and crackers that she had
crammed in her pockets.
Her investment strategy was simple: Make a great many good
solid investments that yielded around 6 percent and be as cheap as
a person could be. She said, “When I see a good thing going cheap
because nobody wants it, I buy a lot of it and tuck it away.” She
explained further, “If you invest $6 million for 51 years at 6 per-
cent and don’t spend a dime of it you wind up with $117 million.
What’s wrong with that?”
She bought heavily in the financial panics—real estate mort-
gages, municipal bonds, and railroad bonds. Stocks provided her
extra profits. She knew the market well, but she also operated on
instinct and common sense. She escaped the Knickerbocker Trust
failure in the panic of 1907. How? She went into the bank and
came out saying, “Those men who run the bank are too damn
prosperous-looking, new suits, new shoes, new ties. I don’t like
it.” She got out only weeks before the collapse.
Hetty Green was the market’s only major female player at the
time. She said, “I wish women had more rights in business and
everywhere else than they do now! Men will take every kind of
advantage of women in business that they would not attempt with
a man. I have been fighting men in the courts all my life.”
Hetty was capable of anything and skilled at getting her way. If
nagging and persistence failed to get her what she wanted she
would turn on the tears. If the tears failed she initiated lawsuits.
Then she always refused to pay the legal fees, often hiring addi-
tional lawyers to defend her against her prior lawyers. Once she
paid $50 for a gun registration license to carry a revolver. When

asked why she said:“Mostly to protect myself against my goddamn
lawyers!” She was feared by all who knew her.
Hetty loved only money. She saw her son Ned as her successor.
She paid his college tuition on the promise that he would not get
married for 20 years. Ned agreed. Ned loved his mother. He had
only one leg. When he was 14 years old, Ned had injured his knee
in a snow-sledding accident. Hetty had refused to send him to a
doctor. She ministered to the cut leg with homemade poultices
and put him to bed. When his father got home and heard what
had happened he was furious, and took his son immediately to the
doctor. The doctor was forced to cut the boy’s leg off, because
gangrene had set in.
It was an era of great characters.
Livermore was aware of the Hetty Green approach to the mar-
ket, a combination of thrift and compounding, and he knew it was
a sound strategy for some people. It just wasn’t for him. He did not
believe a return of 6 percent annually was all you could take out of
the stock market. And he certainly wasn’t interested in living fru-
gally, like Hetty.
The 1901 market was in a frenzy. It was the first frenzied mar-
ket that Livermore had witnessed as a Wall Street trader. It was to
set in his mind the great rule:Nothing ever changes in the market.
The only things that change are the players, the pockets, and the
memories. The new players have no memory of the previous
cycles, because they have not experienced them.
Livermore played the bull side of the 1901 market and made
one exceptional long trade on Northern Pacific with his $10,000
stake. He pocketed $50,000. But Livermore looked at this as only
a larger stake to play with. He was looking for a big break in the
market, a severe correction or a one-day reversal, and then a rally.
In early May, Livermore moved.
“Sell a thousand shares of Steel short at $100,” he barked to the

clerk just seconds before the market opened. “And sell a thousand
shares of Santa Fe at $80.”
The clerk disappeared, order slip in hand, to call the trader on
the floor. Livermore stood as the market opened and watched the
stocks he had shorted fall away, prices dropping like a stone. He felt
vindicated;his judgment had been correct. There was chaos as the
prices plummeted. But his smile quickly disappeared as he saw the
volume. He stood suddenly locked in fear. The volume was huge.
The opening activity on the floor was beyond the limits that the
traders could handle. It was a fast market. Fills on orders were
late—15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, two hours—and when
they were filled, they were filled at prices far from what the clients
had wanted.
Finally, Livermore got a fill on his opening orders. He looked at
the fill orders in disbelief. Even though his brokers were as good as
any on Wall Street, his fills were awful. The stock he had wanted
to sell short at $100 had been filled at $85. The stock he had
wanted to sell short at $80 had been filled at $65. These were the
prices he had wanted to buy them back at to cover his short posi-
tions when the rally came, which he believed would happen later
that day. He made an instant decision to buy the stocks back and
to cover his shorts immediately.
He yelled at the clerk, “Buy a thousand Steel and a thousand
Santa Fe at the market.”
The clerk ran off with the ticket to call it down to the floor of
the exchange. Livermore’s heart sank as he watched his stocks rally.
He watched the tape rise. He knew his shorts would be covered at
great losses now that the rally was in full swing. He had done the
worst thing a speculator could do:He had involuntarily sold at the
bottom and bought at the top.
The clerk returned with the tickets. Livermore opened them
slowly in the palm of his hand. He had established his short

positions at $85 on steel and covered at $110, a loss of $25,000.
He lost a second $25,000 on Santa Fe. He had been right, the
market had done as he predicted, but he was now broke. He had
traded off the ticker instead of off the real quotes, which were
coming too fast on the floor to be accurately caught by the lag-
ging ticker. In this fast market, the ticker had fallen behind by as
much as two hours.
This day provided Livermore with his greatest lesson to that
point. He was trading in real time, for the short term, as he had
done when he was trading in the bucket shops. But the stock mar-
ket ticker was not reporting in real time—it was stuck in delayed
time, falling further behind as the day progressed. The tape spit out
a long-expired price, not the present price. It was now finally clear
to Livermore: Short-term trades were too hard to catch on Wall
Street.
Yet he had been right in his basic judgment. The market did
exactly what he had predicted;the only flaw had been in his exe-
cution. His timing had been off because his orders could not be
executed as quickly as he wanted. As a result, he was late in selling
and late in buying.
Livermore was busted, once again, in the blink of an eye. The
event disillusioned him, left him despondent, depressed, and
entirely worn out. Yesterday he had $50,000 and was full of self-
confidence. Today he was shaken to the core. His only consolation
came from figuring out why he had failed.
He left New York and headed back for Boston and the bucket
shops to start over and rebuild his stake. He also had to rethink his
lifestyle. He had become used to the high life. It was a lifestyle that
took money to fuel, and now he was out of money.
This, of course, had an impact on his married life. Things on
the home front had been going well between the newlyweds until
Livermore went broke again in May 1901. He asked Nettie to

pawn her jewelry—the $12,000 worth he had bought for her in
Europe—as a stake so he could go back to playing the bucket
shops.
She refused. This caused a permanent rift between him and
Nettie, but she did not like the idea of pawning her jewelry. Ulti-
mately, the couple separated. He was now both broke and sepa-
rated from his young wife.
The market was all he knew. So he took a deep mental breath
and decided he had to get a stake and return to Wall Street. He
devoted all his energies to this objective:Get some cash.
Once again he returned to the bucket shops—but, unfortu-
nately, they still remembered him in Boston. No one would take
his orders. He sent people in to do his bidding and place his trades,
but they were quickly uncovered. Soon Livermore had no place to
trade.
Fortunately for Livermore, a new hybrid bucket shop had been
born. This new bucket shop looked even more like a respectable
brokerage and advertised its affiliations with a real brokerage firm
with a seat on the exchange. And, in fact, on rare occasions, these
bucket shops actually did put the customer’s orders through to the
floor of the exchange, but they were far more likely to bucket the
order. That is, they kept the order in the house, unfilled, and bet
against the customer, just canceling out the transaction with in-
house bookkeeping when the customer wanted to close out the
trade or, more likely, went broke on the margin swings.
Livermore was not recognized in these establishments, and he
quickly hooked up with five of them. They promised him they
would stay within one point of the prices that came across the ticker
tape. In other words, they would give him basically an instant fill.
So Livermore went back to his old method of trading off the
tape, taking small gains on many daily trades. He had to build up
a stake before he could make his way back to Wall Street. He set

up a small office with five direct wires to these new quasi–bucket
shops. He traded under an alias as he was still afraid of being rec-
ognized. He also had one other wire installed, direct to a legiti-
mate broker in New York, as well as his own stock ticker, once
he had made enough profits. He traded for the better part of a
year this way and did well enough to buy a car. He started to
renew his trading stake. But as his trading and his winnings
increased, it became harder and harder to convince these estab-
lishments to allow him to trade, particularly since the money was
primarily going one way—from their treasuries into Livermore’s
coffers.
The firms started to play games with Livermore as his trading
position size increased. If Livermore went long a stock with a big
position on heavy margin, the brokerage firm would go short,
catching him for several points when he had to cover. When they
were able to play these games successfully, he would lose money.
But normally, he was winning. Finally, when his trading stake
was big enough, he reversed the game on them. He found a stock
that had been very active at one time but had fallen into disinter-
est and was trading on hardly any volume, a sleepy stock.
He wired each of the five bucket shops and said, “Buy me one
hundred shares of Acme at $81, which was the last recorded trade.”
When the five brokers confirmed his purchase price to him at $81,
he would then wire his real broker in New York, E. F. Hutton.
He now knew what his buy price was:$81. “Buy me 100 shares
of Acme at the asking price of $85,” he’d tell Hutton. He waited
for that sale to cross over the tape and immediately sold his posi-
tion at the bucket shops against the price of $85, netting 4 points,
or $2,000. He would then close out the $85, 100-share position in
New York.
Livermore hit the five houses with this several times. Then,
unexpectedly, he had a windfall: A stock he played was actually

driven up 10 points by his buying. He had 600 shares out, for a
profit of $6,000. After this trade, however, the quasi–bucket shops
finally figured out Livermore’s trick. At one of the firms, he ran
into trouble when he went to collect his money.
“Livermore, we’re not paying you. You rigged the market! And
you been tradin’ under an alias.”
“Don’t accuse me of the things you do,” was his reply.
“You pumped up the price by buying in New York. You drove
up the price just after we took your position. You drove up the
price yourself.”
“You give me too much credit. Your crooked mind lays things
on me that you are capable of, not me.”
“Get outta here. I heard ofyou—the Boy Plunger, ain’t it? Well,
that don’t work here, and you’re headin’ for trouble, big trouble.
You rigged this market with some of your friends.”
“I never trade with partners. I trade only for my own account
and you know it! There is no way you can prove your false allega-
tions!” Livermore said.
“It’s proven in my mind, that’s enough. You cheated us here.”
“You have a big firm with many offices. I trade alone. How
could I cheat you?”
“I don’t know exactly how you did it, but you did it.”
“You just said you don’t know. You have no proof. You just
don’t want to give me what I have coming to me.” Livermore’s
voice rose again.
“You bastard!”
“You’re not going to scare me away with name-calling. I have a
slip in my hand confirming my orders to you to buy and sell for
my account. The trade is completed. You owe me the money, two
thousand dollars. Are you welching?”
Livermore was yelling now and a crowd had gathered. The one

thing these shops could never allow was to fail to pay offon a com-
pleted trade. Because these were shady operations, rumors would
fly, and there would be a rush by the customers to redeem their
accounts for cash—then chaos, like a run on a bank.
There was silence. The manager finally reached into his cash
drawer and yanked out the money. He peeled it out as the cus-
tomers watched. He whispered to Livermore as he peeled off the
last hundred, “Don’t come back here. Don’t ever come back here,
‘Boy Genius.’” Livermore pocketed the money and left.
He had played the exact same trick on them that they had used
to wipe out hundreds of customers who traded on skinny margins
and were wiped out automatically when the market moved against
them.
He got in his car that night and, with a trading friend, headed
for New York. On the way, he was up to his usual tricks—which
led to a favorite story of his about how close he once came to Yale
University.
Livermore and his friend stopped in New Haven and stayed in a
hotel. While they were at the hotel, they learned of a bucket-shop
operation in town. The temptation was too great, and the next
morning they paid it a visit. They received an effusive welcome
from the manger of the shop. Livermore was wearing a light tan
suit. His friend was wearing a blue blazer and khaki pants. New
Haven being a college town, the manager immediately mistook
them for Yale students. And the manager was used to fleecing the
Joe College types.
The first day Livermore played conservatively, and his trading
friend followed his lead. They stayed over a second night and
showed up the next morning, just as the New York market
opened. They played all day, and Livermore’s profits were close to
$1,500. On the third day, dressed in their best collegiate outfits,

they returned again. Livermore opened the day by selling short
500 shares. The stock collapsed, and Livermore covered the short
immediately. The manger slowly paid off the money—$500 mar-
gin and $500 profit.
When he was done, the manager glanced over Livermore’s blue
eyes, his young smiling face, his blond hair. He observed Liver-
more’s polite manner, his quiet demeanor. The manager was no
longer the same effusive person, waiting to get wealthy from rich,
careless college boys.
Livermore returned with cash in hand and said, “I’d like to sell
two hundred Steel short.”
The manger looked at the cash in Livermore’s fist and did
nothing. He just stared before he finally spoke. “You boys aren’t
college students, are you?”
“We never said we were. You assumed we were,” Livermore
answered.
“You’re ringers, hustlers.”
“How can we be ringers and hustlers? If we were, then we
would have to rig the market to move in our favor. You’ve seen
that we have been just sitting here, no phone calls, no mysterious
behavior, no tricks.”
“You got some kind of system for winning, that’s what you
got.”
“You’ve got a system for your customers to lose. They get
wiped out every time they lose their margin. We’re playing by
those rules. Take this order for two hundred Steel.”
“Not on your life, never—you hustled me. You two little bas-
tards hustled me.”
“Look . . .” Livermore continued.
“No, I won’t look. Just get outta here now, before I lose my
temper.”
“Looks like you already lost your temper,” Livermore said, as he

watched the man’s face turn from red to purple. “All right, we’ll
leave.”
“And don’t ever come back!” Livermore heard the manager yell
as the door slammed shut behind him. The manager was not com-
pletely wrong in his assessment. Livermore could have been in col-
lege, maybe even at Yale. But Livermore was interested in only
one college—Wall Street.
He had lost everything twice now, but he knew that was the
only way a person learned in the trading profession. You had to
lose, because it taught you what not to do, and if you did it again,
well, then you were a slow learner and you would lose again. He
had been away for the better part of a year now, a lot of time for
him to think about the mistakes he had made.
He believed he was now ready to go back to New York, back to
Wall Street.
Over his 10 years of trading, Livermore had observed the meth-
ods of the technicians, the chartists, and the mathematicians, all
the theories and techniques of trading developed by graduates of
the superb engineering and technical schools of America. He
believed that they all had merit, but his conclusions were devel-
oped from actual trading, from hands-on participation in the mar-
ket and constant analysis. His ultimate method was beginning to
form in his mind.
He already believed in some basic guides:
• Always evaluate and appraise general conditions first, and
determine the line of least resistance. Is it an upward-trending
market or a downward-trending market? Or is it consolidat-
ing—moving sideways, trying to make up its mind?
• If the overall trend of the market is not in your favor, you are
playing at an extreme disadvantage. Go with the flow, bend
with the trend, do not sail into a gale.

Livermore was looking for the difference between stock gam-
bling and stock speculation. And he never used the words bull market
or bear market because these terms tended to make too permanent
a psychological mind-set.
He was now playing in a different arena from the bucket shops,
and he knew it—that was why he had been wiped out twice. The
game was much bigger and therefore it had more risks. Before Liv-
ermore could solve a problem, he had to state the problem and
define the problem to himself in an honest way.
The first thing he analyzed now—something he would analyze
for the rest of his life—was the dimension of time. He concluded
that in his old life in the bucket shops, time for him had been
instant;that is, he lived in the moment. He could bet on the swings
as they happened, reacting to the moment, the second.
If he was to win on Wall Street, he would have to change his
strategy to accommodate a longer outlook, to react to future time.
He would have to be patient and anticipate the inevitable advances
and declines—make a move and then be patient and wait.
Livermore’s final conclusion was clear:To anticipate the market is
to gamble;to be patient and react only when the market gives the signal is
to speculate.
And he believed the only way to test this solution, to prove this
strategy on Wall Street, was with money. Livermore had been right
on the moves, but wrong on the timing. Now he went into the
market with a new attitude and methodology.
He did all right—but not as well as he had expected, for two
reasons:His trading system was still not what he wanted, and he
was listening to the other traders around him. Instead of holding
onto a winning position, he sold after a few points profit. He
adopted the maxim “you can’t go broke taking a profit” as his phi-
losophy. He was also still affected by his old trading methods from
the days when he had hit and run, taking his profits before the

THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE RUMBLES IN NEW YORK • 55 •
market turned against him. But primarily it was the barrage of
information from other traders that affected his judgment; the
never-ending tips, especially from those he thought were savvy,
experienced traders.
There was one trader, a major player, whom he particularly
admired. This trader gave no tips and offered only one piece of
advice to anyone who asked:“It’s a bull market,”or “It’s a bear mar-
ket,” or “It’s a sideways market, hasn’t made up its mind which way
it’s going yet.”It was this advice that Livermore was later to cherish.
He was now learning that before a play could be made, he first
had to decide on the overall direction of the market. Also, once
the play was made, it had to be seen through to its conclusion. It
was imperative not to sell until he had a good reason to sell—and
if the general trend of the market was with him and there were no
other extenuating circumstances, well, then he had to play it out.
He also studied losers. He divided these suckers into three
classes:
1. Ignorant novices who know nothing, and know that they
know nothing, but still want to play the market. Life span 3
to 30 months.
2. Second-grade suckers or, as Livermore called them, semi-
suckers, who get their information from suckers of an even
higher grade. They have gone through the first phase of
being suckers and have now moved into the second phase.
They quote market aphorisms and the words of market
sages. They are intelligent enough to play the game for a
longer time than the basic suckers. Life span up to 42
months.
3. Suckers of the third kind, who look for bargains, buy at the
bottom, and wait for the rally. They do okay until they hit
a stock that never rallies, or keeps declining.

• 56 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
The one rule that suckers never learn—nor do most market
players—is don’t be a sucker!
Livermore felt that at this point in his career he was still a
sucker—but he was also a special class of sucker. He was what he
called a Careful Mike sucker. Careful suckers listen to others and
cuts their profits short. In their rush to avoid risk, they see the
biggest part of a stock’s move proceed without them. They wait
for the dips that never come, or the dips come too fast for them to
move, or the stock just simply becomes too expensive, in their
minds, to buy again.
Livermore had decided it was the big swings that made the really
big money. And if he was correct and patient, and waited through
the adversity ofnegative fluctuations and corrections, he would pre-
vail. This, of course, did not mean he would be stubborn and sit
through severe drops in the market. His 10 percent bucket-shop rule
stayed with him for the rest of his life:If he lost more than 10 per-
cent against his original purchase price, then he covered his position.
Slowly, through long and deep analysis, constant revision, and
actually buying and selling stock, Livermore was evolving, devel-
oping, rules—his basic theories on speculating in the stock and
commodities markets.
Then he broke all his rules and made a fortune.
He called it his spooky story. He loved to tell it to his sons and
close friends.
It was the spring of 1906 and Livermore was 29 years old, vaca-
tioning in Atlantic City. He had cleared all his stock market posi-
tions and was relaxing on the Jersey shore with a friend, another
trader. Of course, he still had his account with E. F. Hutton.
There, he had a buying power of between 3,000 and 4,000 shares
on margin, at an average price of $100. This meant he had the
capacity for a $400,000 position. It was a medium up-trending
market climate with stocks steadily advancing.

THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE RUMBLES IN NEW YORK • 57 •
One morning Livermore and his friend, slightly bored, wan-
dered into the Atlantic City branch of E. F. Hutton to idly check
out the market. The market was strong, and Livermore’s friend
had a good position on the bull side of the market.
“See, strong market, just like I said it would be. Buy something,
J.L.,” his friend said.
Livermore stood watching the tape in silence as it slid through
his fingers.
“You with us, J.L.? Did you hear what I said?”
Livermore was oblivious to his friend. He kept watching the
tape in silence. All his trading life Livermore had been struck, on
rare occasions, by impulses, premonitions, intuitive urges that he
did not understand. In most cases he did not follow them, but he
kept track of them, and mostly they worked out. He did not know
if it was the unconscious mind making choices based on the accu-
mulated experience of having traded millions of shares or whether
it was some kind of a psychic urge. Maybe it was simply the gam-
bler’s instinct. He knew it defied all his carefully studied and
applied rules. These feelings defied logic or explanation, but they
had always made him money. In fact, he did not know what the
hell it was, but it was a clear impulse to make a move. So, this
spring day in 1906, he moved.
He walked up to the clerk. “Sell a thousand Union Pacific
short.”
His friend went with him. “J.L., why are you putting out a short
line? The market’s going up.”
Livermore took his order slip and studied his friend before
replying. “I don’t know why, exactly. I just think it’s the right
thing to do.”
“You know something, don’t you?” his friend asked. The clerk
was watching now.
Livermore knew if he told his friend he had a tip his friend

would rush over and do what he did. “Please, I told you, I don’t
have a clear reason for doing this.”
“I know you never do anything without a reason. In fact, you
told me that anyone who trades without a plan, a consistent plan,
is a fool. Now you tell me that you have no reason to sell U.P.
short,” his friend said. “You’re breaking your own rules, for cry-
ing out loud!”
Livermore said nothing. He turned and walked back to the
clerk, “Sell short another thousand Union Pacific.”
“You’ve gone crazy, Livermore. Three days of lying in the sun,
taking in the ocean air, and you’re having a mental breakdown.”
Livermore slipped the order into his pocket.
“We’re leaving before you do anything else stupid.” His friend
took him by the arm.
“Just a second,” Livermore said. He went back and sold a third
thousand shares short. He pocketed the order form and then fol-
lowed his friend outside into the sunshine.
Later that afternoon, near the market close, he went back to the
brokerage office to check the price of the Union Pacific stock.
The stock had risen almost two points above where he had sold
short.
“See, J.L., I told you—the market’s up, and you lost $6,000 for
your foolishness.”
Livermore said nothing. He simply smiled and walked back out
onto the boardwalk to watch the descending sun.
The next day he went back in the early afternoon. The stock
was up slightly along with the market, but near the close the stock
started to sell off. Livermore sold 2,000 more shares.
“You are totally crazy, J.L.,” his friend said.
“I think you’re right, because now I have to go back to New
York. I’ve exceeded my margin and I need to oversee my invest-
ment. My vacation is over.”

THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE RUMBLES IN NEW YORK • 59 •
Livermore returned to New York that evening.
That night, April 18, 1906, at 5 A.M., while Livermore was fast
asleep in New York, the earth under San Francisco moved, slowly
at first, rumbling, then quaking, shaking, shivering, as an under-
ground shock wave began to rock the city. The San Andreas fault
was adjusting itself, shrugging its massive shoulders. Most of the
city fell, and a few unlucky souls were trapped in the opening and
closing maw of what had been solid earth. Tall buildings staggered,
collapsed, and fell. The financial district was fiery rubble;the train
station was leveled, and the tracks were twisted and bent like soft
pretzels. The tremblor was felt as far away as Palo Alto. The Stan-
ford University campus was demolished by the quake. Scores of
people were killed.
The next morning Livermore read the newspaper headlines:
“Earthquake Disaster in San Francisco.” He read on:“The market
dropped only a few points on the news.”
Livermore knew that bad news in a bull market climate takes a
lot longer to sink in with the public than bad news in a bear mar-
ket, when the climate is already negative. In fact, before the mar-
ket closed, stocks had rebounded to their former levels. Livermore
was short 5,000 shares, but he was flat on the trade. He had made
no money.
His friend had also returned to New York. “You were right
about bad news coming, but I told you that you can’t spit into the
wind. And the wind is positive. You should have listened to me,
J.L.,” he said.
“Winds change,” Livermore said, reading the ticker tape, not
looking up.
Livermore figured that even if the disaster proved not to be as
bad as was originally thought, railroad stocks would not go up.
The next day the news dribbled in from San Francisco and the
market drifted down, but not drastically. Livermore was convinced

he was right. He went to his broker, got a special line of credit, and
sold another 5,000 shares of Union Pacific short.
The next day, the third day after the earthquake, the market
tumbled. Union Pacific fell like a stone, and Livermore walked out
of the wreckage with $250,000 in profit. He never figured out
exactly why he did what he did in listening to his inner voice. It
was one subject he did not analyze too deeply. He quietly slipped
the cash into his account. Now he could trade with a much bigger
line—an additional $250,000—and that was what he thought
about the most.
He had cut short his Atlantic City vacation. After the earth-
quake windfall, he went to the races in Saratoga Springs for a hol-
iday. He loved the entire spectacle of Saratoga:the beauty of the
place, the regal setting, the sleek, beautiful horses. Most of the
well-dressed, influential people of New York City gathered there
every summer for the races.
Once again, Livermore wandered into the Hutton brokerage
offices in Saratoga to see what was cooking in New York. He sat
quietly studying the tape, looking up at the chalkboard as the
prices of the leading stocks were posted. People came by to whis-
per tips into the ear of the Boy Plunger. Approaching 30, he still
looked like a well-dressed college kid. The office manger came
over and flashed the order slips in front of him, showing the
buy/sell orders from some of the bigger players who were in
Saratoga. Livermore just smiled and said nothing.
His attention was focused on Union Pacific, his old friend. Liv-
ermore had no feelings with regard to either buying long or sell-
ing a stock short. It made no difference, since he had figured that
the market went down as often as it went up. He waited patiently
in cash, waiting to strike. The Union Pacific volume and price
movement Livermore saw on the tape had changed and were now,

he believed, in an accumulation phase. He did no trading for three
days as he watched the stock, ignoring the races. He finally came
to the conclusion that it was being accumulated by a professional
group of players, based on the tape movement.
The stock was at 160 when, on the third day, he started to buy.
He bought in lots of 500 until he had 5,000 shares. He got a fran-
tic call from Ed Hutton, his old, respected friend, a friend who was
also well informed and had friends in high places. There was little
that happened on Wall Street that Hutton did not know about.
“J.L., you’re crazy,” Hutton said.
“What are you talking about?”
“They’re slipping it to you. The pool that runs the stock is feed-
ing the stock to you as fast as you can take it. Then they are going
to walk away from it, and buy it back from you cheap. You’re the
patsy here. You’re the sucker, in a sucker play.”
“You sure?”
“Couldn’t be surer. Comes from the best source, the top.”
“I don’t agree,” Livermore said. “I think it’s being accumu-
lated.”
“Yeah, by you! It’s going to go down. Listen, I like the com-
missions, and I want you to be the biggest trader in New York. I’m
just trying to save you from disaster.”
“All right, Ed,” Livermore paused, thinking. He knew that
Hutton was a true friend, a friend who had helped him often in
the past.
“Thanks, Ed. I’ll quit the position.”
“Right. You can’t expect to win on every play, J.L.,” Hutton
said, and hung up.
Livermore sat down and looked at the order slips and fills in his
hands. After a few minutes, he got up and told the clerk to sell him
out. The Union Pacific position was liquidated at $162 a share.

After commissions it was an even trade. The next day Union
Pacific announced a 10 percent dividend, and the stock shot up 10
points. Livermore would have pocketed $50,000.
Livermore was in the Hutton office in Saratoga when the divi-
dend was announced. He sat there quietly as the stock shot up.
The office manager looked at him and shrugged. He knew what
had happened the day before. He knew what Ed Hutton had told
him. Livermore smiled and nodded.
Livermore was not angry or upset with Hutton. He looked at
the experience as part of his education. How could he get angry
when he understood that the market was independent of feelings?
The market was pure action, cold, and true only to itself. He
believed it always did the right thing, even if he could not see it at
the time.
Livermore now resolved to follow only his own method of trad-
ing stock. He now knew that tipsters came in all sizes and shapes
and wore all kinds of disguises—even close friends with the best
intentions. They were to be avoided at all cost.
Livermore had learned some great lessons over the past 15 years.
He was one year short of 30. He had a good stake and a good line
with his brokers. He had shaken off his bucket-shop methods of
trading. Now, after Saratoga, he was going to notch it up a level.
Instead of concentrating on stocks, he was going to concentrate
on the basic conditions of the market. “Yes,” he thought to him-
self. “Before I pick a stock I will examine the basics of the overall
market.”
He loved this game, the game of speculation. He loved it for its
endless challenge. It was a game that he could never completely
win. But he did not have to win all the time to make a lot of
money. If he could win on average he could have a great life and a
lot of fun.
He was ready.

• 64 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
JESSE LIVERMORE HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIS TRAD-
ing strategy. Slowly, it was starting to form. The first step was to
concentrate on the overall market before making a trade. He
would follow the line of least resistance—up in a bull market, buy
long, down in a bear market, sell short. If the market went side-
ways, he would wait in cash for a clear direction to be established.
He had no interest in finding a bargain or a cheap stock. He was
not a bottom fisher. He was a trend follower. He was only inter-
ested in following the trend, what he called the line of least resist-
ance. He was one of the first true momentum players.
Now that he had a basic market strategy, he needed a money-
management strategy to complement it. He was known on the
Street as the Boy Plunger, but plunging had not always served him
well. He had been busted, broke, three times by the age of 30.
He watched the most successful Wall Street traders in action. He
observed that they were all good money managers, each with an
individual approach. He knew he needed his own system.
He now knew it was not whether the market or a stock would
turn, but exactly when it would turn—timing was everything. But
he also realized that no one could call or predict exactly when the
market would turn or what a stock would do. So, Livermore
developed his probing, or testing the market, approach.
The strategy was simple: Do not plunge. Send out a probe
before buying, just as a commanding officer sends out a reconnais-
sance platoon to probe the enemy lines and gather intelligence.
Livermore followed this basic military strategy in stock market
trading, which is, after all, a kind of war.
It is very important to note that Livermore would determine
the number of shares or the size of his investment in dollars before
making the first trade.
If Livermore planned to take a position of 10,000 shares in a
given stock, he would first probe with a purchase of 20 percent of

his planned position—that is, he would buy 2,000 shares. Suppose
he paid $100 a share. If the price dropped after he made his first
purchase, he would either close out the first position or wait—
never taking a loss of more than 10 percent.
He expected the stock price to rise. If it did, he would buy a
second position of another 2,000 shares at, say, $101 per share. He
would then be in profit.
If the stock continued to rise, he would take a third position of
2,000 shares at, say, $104.
At this point he would own 6,000 shares;he would be 60 per-
cent invested against his objective of a 10,000-share position. But
he would have made each purchase at a slightly more expensive
level. For Livermore, this was good:It proved to him that the stock
was moving in the right direction.
Now he would wait for a further move and a correction. For
example, suppose the stock moved from $100 to $112, then had a
normal correction down to $104 dollars, the spot where he had
made his last purchase.
If the stock moved up from this price of $104, Livermore would
make his final purchase of 4,000 shares at, say, $106, giving him an
average price of around $105 for the total position of 10,000
shares.
To put it another way:Livermore would establish 20 percent of
his planned position on the first purchase, 20 percent on the sec-
ond position, and 20 percent on the third position. He would wait
for a confirmation and then take his final position of 40 percent.
He considered each of these purchases to be a crucial stage in
establishing his overall position. If, at any time, the stock went
against him, he would be patient and wait, or he would close out
all his positions, never sustaining a loss of more than a 10 percent.
The first probe or transaction is crucial;it is the key to this tech-
nique. After the first transaction, do not make a second until you

have confirmed that your judgment is correct. When the stock has
moved in the direction you expected it to move, and you have a
profit, your judgment has been confirmed.
Livermore believed that stocks are never too high to begin buy-
ing or too low to begin selling short. Livermore believed that there
was only one side of the market to avoid. He could be on the bull
side or the bear side—it made no difference to Livermore—just so
long as he was not on the wrong side.
From experience, Livermore knew that one of the hardest
things to do as a trader was to sell out a position early if he was
wrong on the initial purchase and the stock moved against him.
Trying to explain the market to his boys, he said, “The transac-
tion becomes personal to too many speculators when their judg-
ment is proven wrong and the stock moves against them. It is
exactly at this time that the speculator must take action and cut
losses. The speculator has been proven wrong, because the stock
has moved against him, and must now admit it quickly and close
the trade. It is a question of overcoming and control of the ego.”
Livermore had come to realize that the big money was in the
big swings, in waiting for the basic trend to play out and riding
the stock for as long as possible before the inevitable change in the
basic trend was seen in the line of least resistance. He would wait
for the market to give him the clues. He would not anticipate the
market by guessing its direction. Like Sherlock Holmes, he would
wait for the clues to appear, the facts to mount up, before making
his conclusion.
Livermore now had three important rules to follow in his new
trading strategy:
• First, decide on the overall direction of the market. Determine
the line of least resistance. Be sure of the basic trend.

• Second, develop a buying strategy. Probe the market. Test it by
trading small positions first. Do not rush in and bet your
whole stash on impulse.
• Third, be patient and wait for all the facts. Wait for a move to
play out. It is the big moves that make the big money.
It was late in 1906 when his new strategy finally paid off. Liver-
more sensed what he believed was going to be a major change in
market direction—a basic change downward. This was not obvi-
ous to the major players or the press, who were still calling for the
roaring bull market to continue.
He examined all the factors carefully and decided that the market
was cresting, even though the line of least resistance still appeared to
be upward. He used his new trading approach to confirm this judg-
ment, sending out probes across a variety of the leading stocks. He
probed the four leading stock groups, selling at least two stocks short
in each of the four groups. His short sales held—that is, the stocks
that he had sold short went down, and on the rallies those stocks fal-
tered, unable to make new highs, closing only a few points up, but
then sinking, sliding backward off their old highs.
Livermore slowly increased his positions on each failed rally.
The last holdout was Reading, a railroad stock that would not
budge. It was supposed to be cornered, a stock whose outstanding
shares were all controlled by a pool, or a person. Livermore
believed no one stock could withstand the basic tidal wave that he
saw on the horizon—the change from an upward-trending bull
market to a downward-trending bear market. He believed that
Reading could not buck the trend. It would collapse along with
the others when the time was right.
Livermore decided to help its decline along. He sold short
through two brokers simultaneously. He sold 4,000 shares of

Reading at $111. He had the market orders timed to hit the mar-
ket simultaneously. The orders were filled at diminishing prices.
He hit Reading again by selling 2,000 more, establishing his short
line of 6,000 shares at a final price of $92. He was well into profit
in less than a few hours. Reading then collapsed, as did all the
other stocks in which Livermore had established positions.
His first major escapade using his new technique of probing the
market had worked. Now he was faced with another problem:
when to cover and buy back his shorts.
Livermore had been wiped out and had seen his profits disap-
pear many times before by not closing out his positions and bank-
ing his paper profits while he could. This time he did not wait for
the market to show a clear sign that it had bottomed out. He
wanted his profits. He closed out his positions, put the money in
the bank, and left for Palm Beach.
He was weary of trading and wanted to forget about the market
for a while. He loved deep-sea fishing, so he went and relaxed. He
deserved it. He also wanted to reflect more on his new trading
strategy. He had almost a million dollars in his bank account now.
It was 1907, he was 30 years old, and he knew he was finally on
the right track.
After Palm Beach, he headed for Paris. He liked Europe because
there was no talk of the stock market, and he wanted to rest his
mind for a while. With plenty of money in his bank account, in a
beautiful place with beautiful people, he was content for a while.
But it did not last for long. His passion was the stock market,
and soon he was drawn back into it. He read the Paris edition of
the Herald Tribune. It became clear that the New York market was
headed for an even bigger tumble then he had originally thought.
He was sorry now that he had closed out his positions so soon.
He really had no basic reason to close out the original positions

except that he was fearful of losing his profits. He wanted to put
his profits in the bank, which he had done.
He took a fast liner back to New York.
He did not know it, but he was about to witness the panic of
1907.
As soon as he arrived he went short the market again, using
probes to make sure he was correct in the basic trend. He estab-
lished very large short positions in several of the leading stocks.
The turn-of-the-century market had been a full runaway bull
market to date, with wild gyrations in the prices of the more spec-
ulative issues.
The basic financial problem soon became apparent: call loans.
Call loans were time-restricted demand loans made by banks to
brokerage houses. The cash from these loans was, in turn, put up
for margin by the brokerage houses for their customers. The loans
were the fuel that powered the market—the margin was essential.
These loans were made every day at the Money Post between
12:00 and 2:15 P.M.,when the bankers appeared on the stock mar-
ket floor ready to loan money to the brokers. The problem had
been developing for months, but it culminated on October 24,
1907.
The problem was simple. The banks did not have enough cash
available for the brokers to cover their margin requirements. What
money was available was being offered at 100 to 150 percent inter-
est. And the banks, which usually fought to lend this high-yield
money, were not interested in extending any further loans to bro-
kerage houses, at any interest rate. It was a credit crunch of the
most dire proportions. Stocks plummeted. Livermore kept selling
short, pyramiding his position into the weakness.
On October 24, at 12 P.M., chaos ruled on the floor of the
exchange. Hundreds of brokers gathered around the Money Post,



==================================================

==================================================

• 70 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
screaming out their demands for short-term loans, but there was
no money available—no money at all. This meant that the brokers
had to sell their stock positions on the open market to cover their
margins, but there were no buyers for stock. All the buying had
dried up. It was the market’s worst nightmare—no cash and no
buyers—and it had happened quickly. Pure, abject, unadulterated,
raw fear swept over the brokers and the bankers.
Wall Street was out of cash.
The brokers ran to R. H. Thomas, president of the stock
exchange. He called James Stillman, president of the National City
Bank, the richest, most powerful bank in the United States, a bank
that boasted of never extending a loan at more than 6 percent
interest.
When Stillman had finished listening to Thomas, he simply said
“We must go see Mr. Morgan.”They left immediately to visit J. P.
Morgan, head ofthe House ofMorgan, the world giant offinance.
Morgan listened to Stillman and Thomas as they outlined the
disastrous situation, a disaster that could spread right across the
nation and cripple its entire industrial base. Morgan wasted no
time. When he had heard enough, Morgan rose, and said:“Return
to the exchange and tell them that there will be money for them.”
They asked, “Where from?”
“From the banks,” Morgan answered, staring at the two men.
“Where else?”
Thomas sped back to the floor of the exchange and told the
crowd that was standing around the Money Post that there would
be money for them, “Mr. Morgan has assured us!”
“When?” they yelled in desperation.
“Soon,” came the answer.
“How much?” They screamed.
“Enough!” was the answer.
But the clock kept ticking. Finally, at a little after 2 P.M., John T.

Atterbury ofVan Emburgh and Atterbury, a close associate of J. P.
Morgan, arrived on the floor. The noise disappeared and the
crowd stood transfixed, opening a path to the Money Post for
Atterbury. When he got to the post, he raised his hand and said “I
am authorized to lend ten million dollars.”
The crowd went crazy, with brokers yelling out the amounts
they needed. Atterbury yelled over the voices. “Quiet, be quiet,
one at a time, there will be enough for everyone!”
“Where do we get the money?” one broker yelled.
“You will be told where to go tomorrow! Now take it easy, and
let’s get this done,” Atterbury responded.
This day became a legend on Wall Street—the day J. P. Morgan
singlehandedly saved the stock market and perhaps prevented the
financial collapse of the nation.
When Thomas and Stillman had left the offices of the House of
Morgan, J. P. Morgan had called the presidents of the major banks.
He told each of them, “We need to prop up the market with cash,
and we need to do it now. We must give them what they need. It
is a critical situation.”
Each banker replied in the same manner:“We are loaned to the
maximum. We have no cash to lend to the brokers to support the
market.”
“You have reserves!” Morgan exclaimed.
“But we are already below the legal limits!”
“Use the reserves, what the hell do you think they are for?” he
told each one of the bankers.
Morgan was a person whom Livermore admired. Morgan was a
brilliant person of practical principles, a patriot, a financial giant.
That day, October 24, 1907, was to be branded into Livermore’s
memory. It was the first time he had ever made more than $1 mil-
lion in profit, and he had done it in a single day. Furthermore, the
day was not yet over. For him it was most important that he had

followed his new rules. He had been patient in waiting for the big
turn in the market. He had started with small positions, sending
out probes into the market to confirm that he was right. And
finally, when everything was in his favor, he had done what he
loved best:He plunged big time, like a king cobra.
His paper profits and his stock positions were so large near the
end of the day, as a result of his pyramiding, that he now had an
even bigger decision to make. Morgan’s announcement to inject
cash had solved only one problem:It reestablished liquidity—sol-
vency among the brokers. But the other major problem was that
there was still no demand. Livermore looked over the market near
the close, and found there were simply no bids for stocks. Nobody
wanted to buy stocks at any price.
Livermore knew that he could perpetrate a monumental raid by
starting to sell at the opening the next day. The downward pressure
of his hammering the key stocks would cause a further decline. His
margin now was ever increasing;his profits had pyramided, risen as
the market had fallen. He was in a position to begin the day by
selling short 10,000 shares of Union Pacific, the market darling at
the time. He could follow by selling half a dozen other stocks that
were considered the bluest of the blue chips. He now had the
account margin and the trading skills to hammer those issues into
oblivion. He was looking at not $1 million profit, but $10 million,
$20 million, if he hit the market hard the next morning.
Now it would be his turn to make the big decision. Would he
support the market or drive it down and down and down, until the
board of governors had to close the exchange, maybe forever?
Before the close of the trading day, while Livermore was study-
ing his next move, a friend of his, Warren Augustus Reed, paid
him a visit. During the panic that day Livermore had explained to
his friend, who was a banker in a powerful investment banking
house, exactly what would happen. Reed had watched Livermore

operate in the past and was a believer in his market skill and deadly
prowess.
Reed disappeared for a while when he was called away to see his
boss, the president of the firm.
Reed returned and explained to Livermore, “J.L., I’ve been
asked to talk to you about the market and request that you refrain
from any more short selling. I understand that you are looking at
even bigger profits for yourself if you hammer away, but sometimes
we have to look at the greater good.”
“Auggie, this comes from your boss?” Livermore asked.
“No. It comes from a person more powerful than my boss,” he
answered.
Livermore knew whom he meant—J. P. Morgan. “You sure?”
“I’m sure. It came from him personally. I was in the office when
it happened and heard the conversation.”
Livermore thought for a minute. “You know these same men
have been selling into this market for months now—feeding stock
to the public, knowing that the decline was coming, only inter-
ested in looking after themselves, killing the public?”
“Yes, I know, but J.L., isn’t that always the way, when prices get
too high? The smart, market-savvy people sell to the less-smart
people, the public.”
“Yes.”
“J.L., if we are to get this market under control then we will
have to stop the bleeding, the selling, and staunch the supply, or
there will be no market left. There will only be chaos.”
Livermore pondered his position for a few minutes. “Tell your
boss that I am in agreement with what he says. I will not sell any
more stock today. I will cover my short positions in the morning
by buying in the stock. After that, I will start to aggressively buy
additional stocks on the opening. I understand the gravity of the
situation.”

“Thanks, J.L., I’ll report this back to the man himself.”
Livermore had already analyzed the situation carefully before his
friend had shown up. The carnage this day had been horrific, and
Livermore felt the exchange was due for a rally on a technical
rebound basis, provided it was not raided. Plus, he had some mon-
umental short positions that would have to be covered in a liquid
market to preserve his profits.
Finally, he had altruistic reasons for agreeing. Further raiding
would severely hurt the country. He was astounded that he had
this power in his hands, the raiding power and skill to actually
drive the market into oblivion. He was 31 years old.
The next morning Livermore fueled the rally by covering his
short positions. As the market continued to rally, he bought
another 100,000 shares of various companies, which he fed back
into the market that same day as the public jumped in. When the
day was over he was worth $3 million—not in paper profits, but in
cold, hard cash.
“What a life,” he thought. Broke three times before he was 30
years old and, at the age of 31, potentially able to batter the New
York Stock Exchange into oblivion. He smiled to himself. He had
shared power with J. P. Morgan for one day. Morgan had the
power to save the market from oblivion, and Livermore had the
power to hammer it into oblivion—even Morgan could not have
stopped him. He had gone from being thrown out of bucket shops
to being asked by the most powerful banker in America to lay off
Wall Street, stop the punishment. His reputation was growing, and
he had held the financial welfare of the nation in his hands for one
day. What a thrill!
He later told his sons that this had been one of the most impor-
tant events of his life, when J. P. Morgan asked a favor of him dur-
ing the crash of 1907. But for Livermore there was no satisfaction
in this raw power. The satisfaction, the exhilaration, came from

beating the Street. Finally, after thousands of trades and hundreds
of hours examining his trading techniques, he knew he was right.
The big money was made in the big swings. Clipping points had
served him well in establishing a stake, but the big money was in
the big swings. He only could catch the big swings if he was
patient and waited until they came along, waited until his judg-
ment had been confirmed.
He believed he had advanced over these two days from the gam-
bler class of trader to being a true speculator who looked ahead,
evaluated the general conditions, and moved prudently—testing
first, and plunging only after he was convinced that all the factors
were in his favor.
The Boy Plunger was no longer a plunger at all. At least in his
own mind, he was a speculator. From the public’s point of view he
was still considered a wild plunger, because they saw only the last
10 minutes of a three-act play—they had no interest in Act 1 or
Act 2, which were done in secret anyway. It was the results they
watched and wanted to emulate.
Livermore now had a plan, an investment strategy that he
believed worked, and he knew that one essential secret of success
was at its core—the hard work of never-ending analysis.
Now he had to see if this had been a fluke or if he really did
have the beginnings of a solid trading approach to the market. But
he needed a rest first. He decided to try a vacation again, to enjoy
himself. He bought a yacht and was about to head south. He
wanted to go fishing, his favorite sport.
But it was not to be, not yet. For Livermore studied and played
the commodities market just as he did the equities market.
Livermore was soon as sure that a crash was coming in the com-
modities market as he had been in the stock market. So before
heading out for his vacation and enjoying his new yacht, he set out
his probes and finally wound up short 10 million bushels of wheat

and 10 million bushels of corn. The wheat did what it was sup-
posed to do—plummeted. But corn was rising in the face of cas-
cading commodity prices. Livermore soon found out why:Arthur
Cutten, a brilliant trader, was running a corner on corn.
In the early 1900s, running a corner was common. A pool of
people, or sometimes a powerful individual, would determine
what the short position was on a commodity or a stock. Then they
would launch an assault and buy every single share of stock or, in
this case, bushel of corn. This would leave the people who held
the short positions with no stock to buy to cover their short posi-
tions. These people would then have to accept whatever stock was
offered at whatever price it was offered. When a corner happened,
it happened fast. Corners had ruined many traders who went in to
cover their short positions and simply found that nothing was
available or that it was available only at huge losses.
Arthur Cutten was born in Guelph, Ontario, in 1870, seven
years before Livermore. Cutten was later to be called the Great
Bull as Livermore was to be called the Great Bear. He was built
like Livermore—slim and ofaverage height. But unlike Livermore,
who dressed in the finest fashions, Cutten dressed in plain clothes
of the best value.
It took Cutten five years of hard work as a teenager on the fam-
ily farm where he was born to save $50. He took the $50 and jour-
neyed to Chicago. There he got a clerical job with A. S. White
and Company, at the wage of $4 a week. Cutten was frugal and
watched every penny—this remained with him all his life. He was
tenacious, diligent, and hard-working. It took him another five
years to save up $1,000. He was now 25. But he had more than just
$1,000—he also had five years of intensive experience in trading
commodities for White.
He and Livermore also had the same code of silence and secrecy.
Whenever Cutten could, he hung out in the “Pigeon Roost,” a

small area above the wild and wooly grain pits of Chicago. He
carefully studied the floor traders and the actions of the customers
in White’s offices. He, like Livermore, worked every night on
sheets of long columnar paper looking for trends, patterns, and
timing mechanisms.
After five years of hard work for his employer, and for himself in
his off-hours, he went to White and said, “I would like to open a
trading account here.”
“For whom?” White asked.
“For myself,” Cutten answered.
“You are a smart young man, Arthur. You must know that a
man of modest means cannot trade in the commodities market. It
would be sheer lunacy.”
“But sir . . .”
“Never mind, you must heed my advice and you will thank me
for it later. My advice is to avoid the commodities market, avoid
the stock market. It is a fool’s game and you know that a fool and
his money are soon parted.”
Cutten wondered to himself how the fool got the money in the
first place, but he was not about to argue with the severe White.
“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”
On his lunch break he went to another firm and opened an
account with his $1,000 in cash.
Three months later, he entered White’s office. He had his alpaca
jacket in his hand. White was on the phone and motioned for
young Cutten to sit down. Cutten remained standing and gently
placed his alpaca jacket, his trading uniform jacket, on White’s
desk.
White hung up the phone and looked at the jacket lying on his
desk. “What’s going on here, Arthur?”
“I’ve been elected to membership in the Chicago Board of
Trade, sir.”

“Arthur, we’re busy here. Make sense.”
“I’ve purchased a seat on the exchange.”
“How?”
“With my trading profits, sir.”
White sat dumbstruck. He finally spoke. “So, you are resigning.”
“Yes, sir. And I expect I will never work for another man for the
rest of my life.”
Cutten closed the door on a shocked White. True to his words,
Cutten never did work for another person.
Twelve years later, in 1907, Cutten was a legend in the Chicago
grain pits. Secretive, tenacious, holding only his own counsel, he
was considered a very formidable force. He and Livermore were
kindred spirits.
Cutten had found out about Livermore’s position. He had Liv-
ermore, his only equal, in his clutches. Livermore was short 10
million bushels of corn. For every 10 cents Cutten drove the price
of corn upward, it cost Livermore $1 million. He had Livermore
cornered.
The thoughts of a nice vacation in Florida were far from a real-
ity now. It was survival mode for Livermore again. On the positive
side, he saw the price of wheat decline as he had predicted, so he
had a profit in wheat. But it could all be wiped out—he could be
wiped out—if he did not correct his problem with corn. He
needed a strategy to defeat Cutten and extricate himself from this
sinkhole. He knew Cutten was aware of his huge short position
and would pull out all the stops to annihilate him.
That night, as he lay in bed, an idea came to him based on
something he had heard. He moved swiftly. Livermore knew the
corner was false;there was plenty of corn available from the farm-
ers, so there was no underlying reason why the price of corn
should go up. Cutten was playing with the market. In particular,
he was playing with Livermore’s financial life.

THE CRASH OF 1907 • 79 •
The first thing Livermore did was to cover the 10 million
bushels of wheat he was short at a good profit. This gave him cash
in his account to trade with. He had heard that Cutten had begun
cornering the oat market along with the corn market. In the oat
market, Cutten was up against Chicago’s powerful Armour family,
trying to catch them in a corner. Livermore confirmed this as soon
as he could.
Then Livermore made his major move. He sold 50,000 bushels
of oats at the market, then another 50,000, then another, then
another—200,000 bushels in all. The price of oats dropped drasti-
cally with these sales. He figured the traders would believe what
they saw and conclude that the Armours were at work to break
Cutten’s oat corner. They would also conclude that the Armours
would move in to bust up the corn corner next.
The traders did as Livermore had predicted. When they saw the
price of oats breaking, the traders jumped into the corn market,
selling their positions while the price was high. Livermore was
there to buy. He bought all they could shovel his way. He covered
the 6 million bushels he was short in 10 minutes and the rest
before the market closed that day. He also closed out the 200,000
bushels of oats before the market closed.
His total loss, with his profit in wheat, was $25,000. Within
days, Cutten ran the price ofcorn up another 25 cents. This would
have been a loss ofat least $2.5 million for Livermore, ifhe had not
been able to cover.
Now he was really ready for his vacation!
He was also ready for a better lifestyle. He moved into a beauti-
ful furnished apartment at 194 Riverside Drive. He had already
purchased his first yacht, the Anita Venetian, and sent it down to
Palm Beach. He was in good company. George Jay Gould, the heir
to Jay Gould’s fortune, had a similar yacht, the Atlantic,a 300-foot,
steel-hulled, triple-screw yacht;and J. P. Morgan traveled the globe

in his yacht, the Corsair, the largest yacht afloat anywhere in the
world.
The Anita Venetian was a 202-foot steam schooner of first-class
construction. She carried the red, white, and blue pennant of the
Columbia Yacht Club. Livermore purchased a snappy brass-
buttoned blue blazer for wearing on board, along with gray flannel
slacks and a handmade captain’s hat. He was a dapper captain,
ready for fun.
Livermore headed down to Palm Beach to board the waiting
Anita.He loved Palm Beach and the Palm Beach society. He had a
great passion for fishing the waters off South Florida, trolling in
the deep, dark blue waters of the Gulf Stream, a current in the
ocean that moves up from the coast of South America.
The Gulf Stream comes in closest to the Florida coast off Palm
Beach, sometimes getting within three miles of the white sandy
beaches of the rich. The pelagic fish, the big wanderers, travel
inside the stream, using the 3- to 4-knot current to speed their way
north. It was these fish that Livermore was interested in, the big
fish, just as he was only interested in the big swings in the market.
The giant bluefin tuna;the world-class monster sharks, hammer-
heads, tigers, and makos;the run of sailfish;the occasional marlin,
wahoo, or king mackerel; and the tarpon down in Key West—
these were his prey, the challenging, unpredictable, hard-fighting
gypsy fish of the great Atlantic Ocean.
He spent his days on board the Anita basking in the warm
Florida sun, fishing, and enjoying life. At night he would eat in the
great watering holes of Palm Beach, such as the Palm Beach Inn.
Located directly on the beach, it contained 425 rooms. He would
eat exquisite meals there and adjourn to the ocean-side gallery to
have cigars and brandy and chat with his Wall Street friends.
Most nights after dinner he would wander down to the famous
Beach Club, or Bradley’s, as it was sometimes called after its

owner, Edward Bradley, a well-known gambler whose own horses
would later go on to win four Kentucky Derbies. Bradley was
quiet and secretive like Livermore, but, unlike Livermore, he had
a checkered past that stretched all the way out to the Wild West,
where he had known Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp. He had been
an army scout during the Apache wars and was credited with aid-
ing in the capture of Geronimo.
“Billy the Kid used to borrow money from me to bet on the
Indian pony races,” Bradley would tell Livermore, laughing.
“Who wouldn’t give him money? He’d shoot you dead if you
didn’t.” Livermore used to love to tell this to his sons.
In Palm Beach, Bradley had a secret deal with Henry Flagler,
John D. Rockefeller’s partner in Standard Oil and a churchgoing
Christian. Flagler built the Florida East Coast Railway, which
eventually ran the entire length of Florida, all the way down to
Key West. Flagler also built four major hotels in Palm Beach. His
clientele loved to gamble, so he was willing to strike a deal with
Bradley and leave him alone. Bradley’s Beach Club ultimately
became the longest-running illegal gambling casino in the history
of the United States.
Bradley’s was simple, but elegant. After 7 P.M.the most informal
attire for men was a tuxedo, with no exceptions. White tie and tails
were preferred, and there was no smoking in the gaming room.
The food was five-star. Bradley paid his chef $25,000 for the sea-
son, which was a king’s ransom at the turn of the century. His
clientele included the elite of the U.S. financial, entertainment,
and political worlds. The entrance door was painted white, with a
square frosted-glass panel in the center that said “B.C.,” for Beach
Club.
He and Livermore quickly became fast friends, although they
both were reticent and not quick to expose their true feel-
ings. They had a mutual respect and admiration for each other.

Livermore loved to gamble at Bradley’s. Bradley was also known as
“Bet-on-Anything Bradley.” Even so, he rarely lost.
He once told Livermore that luck was a real thing. It went right
along hand-in-hand with hard work. He said, “A person either
works for a living or gambles for a living. In fact life is a gamble,
but if a person chooses to take up gambling for a living it has to be
studied intelligently and worked at least twice as hard as any other
profession.” Livermore repeated this to Dorothy, his wife.
Bradley often walked around with over $100,000 on him.
When major players wanted to cash out after winning, he would
walk up to them, smile, congratulate them, and peel off $1,000
bills while the croupier collected their chips. The main test for
membership was approval by Bradley himself. He would interview
prospective members at length and, if he liked them, he would
find out the answer to the final, most important question:Could
they pay their bills if they lost?”
Armed Pinkerton guards posted everywhere protected Bradley’s
while remaining inconspicuous. The game room had a trap door
installed in case the place was ever raided—the tables could be slid
out of view. A guard with a rifle protected the counting room.
The guard was positioned at a small window that provided a full
view of the gaming room. The guard was a crack shot instructed
to shoot anyone who tried to rob the place. The same instructions
were given to the Pinkerton agents. Since Bradley’s was located on
Palm Beach, actually an island, there was no place to run. Thieves
gave Bradley’s a wide berth and the staff members were very dis-
creet;any talk about the clientele and they were immediately fired.
Bradley kept spies on his staff to keep him informed of everything.
Livermore passed many a pleasant evening at the Beach Club
playing one of the three games of chance available:hazard, chemin
de fer, and roulette. The limits at Bradley’s were even higher than
those at the casinos in Monte Carlo.

THE CRASH OF 1907 • 83 •
It was on one of these nights at Bradley’s that he heard the news
of the failure of one of the great cotton players. Ed Hutton was
there and told him how Percy Thomas, the Cotton King, had tried
to run a corner on cotton and been annihilated. He went broke in
March cotton.
Hearing about Thomas triggered an interest in cotton for Liv-
ermore. On his return to New York in his private rail car, he stud-
ied the trade papers. It became clear that everyone was bearish on
July cotton. As July approached, Livermore started to buy cotton.
He knew that there was little time left to cover short positions. It
was May, and he had no trouble establishing a long position of
120,000 bales. Shortly after he bought, the market turned upward;
but the volume was sluggish, and Livermore had a big position, a
position hard to sell in this limited time frame.
So Livermore performed one of his famous trading tricks:In the
last 10 minutes of trading on Saturday, he stepped in and sent out
four separate orders to buy 5,000 bales. This ran the Chicago price
up 30 points on the close. Livermore knew this would drive the
London market up on Monday to establish parity with the New
York market. He knew he was trading on the line of least resist-
ance, but he also knew he was carrying a huge illiquid position.
His strategy worked, and the London cotton market opened
strongly—only it was not 30 points higher, it was 50points higher.
Nevertheless, the trading on Monday was strong in Chicago, but
not strong enough for Livermore to get rid of his large position.
He became worried.
The next morning on his way to work, he met a friend who
showed him the front page of the New York World. The headline
read:“July Cotton Cornered by Jesse Livermore.”
Livermore always denied he knew anything about the story, but
the market soared on the news. Taking his good luck as it was
offered, Livermore sold out his entire position of 140,000 bales.

• 84 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
This became a Livermore trademark: When good luck came his
way—an unpredictable windfall—he would take it and run, not
wait for more good luck. This, of course, was especially true with
big illiquid positions. They could sometimes be hard to sell with-
out driving the market down.
Livermore claimed he had nothing to do with the newspaper
article. Whatever the case, he seized the opportunity when it pre-
sented itself.
The next day he met a friend, one of the biggest players in the
cotton market, who stopped him in the street. “I was waiting for
you to try and market that big line of cotton you had. It would
have been a hard sell. That was one of the neatest moves I ever saw,
J.L. Congratulations.”
“I had nothing to do with that story. Nothing at all,” Livermore
said.
“I don’t know how you got the paper to print it. All I can say is
I tip my hat to you. I figured that you were manipulating the Lon-
don market, but compounding it with the newspaper article—
now that was a very smart play.”
“I told you, I . . .”
“J.L., I would never expect you to admit it. Now, would I?” He
winked, “It would be dumb to admit it to me, and you’re not
dumb, are you?”
He left Livermore standing on the street as he strolled off.
Livermore’s reputation continued to grow—some of it true,
some of it embellished as it bounced along from lips to ears, to lips,
to other ears, all up and down Wall Street. Livermore just shook
his head, smiled to himself, and moved on in secrecy and silence.
He felt good, proud of his accomplishments. He had no inkling
that disaster lay waiting just around the corner, a disaster of mon-
umental proportions.

JESSE LIVERMORE WAS NOW RICH AND SUCCESSFUL, ABLE
to indulge his every passion. And Livermore loved beautiful
women. The newspapers went so far as to claim he had fallen for
the famous Lillian Russell, girlfriend of “Diamond Jim” Brady.
Russell was known as the “American Beauty.” A woman of
classic looks, she was born in 1861 in Clinton, Iowa. Her real
name was Helen Louise Leonard. She moved with her family to
New York after the Civil War. She was taking singing lessons
when Tony Pastor heard her and signed her up to appear at his
casino. She later appeared with the McCaull Opera Company at
Weber and Field’s Music Hall, before forming her own company.
She was the toast of New York at the turn of the century. She had
a great love for jewelry and an outgoing, dazzling personality. It
was no surprise when she fell for Diamond Jim.
Diamond Jim was as flamboyant and colorful as Russell. He
started as a baggage handler on the railroads, then became a sales-
man, and finally a supplier of equipment to every railroad in the
United States. The first line of equipment he sold, the equipment
that made his first fortune, was barbed wire. A man of giant
appetites, some people believed he had eaten himself to death
when he died in 1917. He adorned his body with diamonds:stick
pins, cufflinks, and rings. Diamonds were even sewn into his pants,
as buttons to hold up his substantial suspenders. And he loved to
give away diamonds, especially to the American Beauty, Russell.
Diamond Jim was a legend as a gourmand as well, reported to
have gone to incredible extremes to satisfy his appetites for pleas-
ure. He supposedly sent a spy to the Cafe Marguery in Paris to
steal the recipe for its famous sole de Marguery. When his success-
ful spy returned to New York, Brady gave a dinner for Victor Her-
bert, the composer, and Marshall Field, the department store king,
to introduce them to the dish. While they were eating, Diamond

Jim exclaimed, “Put this sauce on a goddamn Turkish towel and
you could eat it!”
Livermore was said to have started courting Russell in 1907, just
after he made his first million in the panic. He supposedly wined
her and dined her all over New York and stole her away from
Diamond Jim. The rumors became official when he was reported
to have cruised down to Palm Beach with her aboard the Anita
Venetian.
But it was not Livermore who was courting Russell—it was his
good friend Alexander P. Moore, who was married at the time.
Moore would later become ambassador to Spain, and he would
remain a lifelong friend of Livermore’s. Rich and privileged from
birth, Moore admired and respected Livermore, the self-made
trader.
Livermore smiled to himself when he read about his affair in the
Police Gazette.The Gazetteaccused him of being the reason behind
the breakup of the most famous couple in New York. Livermore
loved his little secrets. He, Moore, and Russell knew what was
really going on, and that was enough.
Livermore had it all. He was in his 30s and was a legend on Wall
Street. J. P. Morgan himself had even once asked him to stop sell-
ing short, stop driving the market down. Heady stuff for a young,
self-made trader who had had no formal education or bloodline to
provide him with social standing or a stake to get established.
He carried on in Palm Beach at the Breakers Hotel in the com-
pany of Russell and his elegant friend Moore. He had $3 million
in the bank. Life was beautiful. What could go wrong?
The three ofthem enjoyed a marvelous meal at the Breakers and
took two pedicabs, the famous white wicker three-wheeled Palm
Beach cabs pedaled by well-dressed black drivers, to Bradley’s
Beach Club for a little gambling. Russell and Moore headed

straight for the roulette wheel, and Livermore sat down for some
chemin de fer. After a while he left the table and joined Edward
Bradley, the owner, for a drink in the bar.
Percy Thomas, the Cotton King, was also in the bar, sitting by
himself at another table. “Shame about the Cotton King,” Liver-
more said.
“Yes. He was one of our best customers.” Bradley added, “I like
him and we have an understanding that he doesn’t gamble until he
gets back on his feet. But he’s always welcome for dinner and
drinks.”
The conversation drifted on to other things. Bradley finished his
drink of soda water—the only thing he ever drank—and left the
table. Thomas came over to Livermore and asked, “May I join you,
Mr. Livermore?”
“Sure, call me J.L.,” Livermore answered, pointing to an empty
chair.
Thomas was smooth, cultured, erudite, and magnetic. He was a
powerful force of nature, able to converse on any subject. They
talked of music. Livermore loved classical music and light opera. It
was one of the reasons he liked Russell so much. He and Moore
attended many of her performances.
Thomas finally came out with the reason for the visit. “J.L., I
have something on my mind, and I would like to come to the
point.”
“By all means,” Livermore said.
“Let’s be partners in the cotton market.”
“I’m flattered. If I was going to be partners with anyone it
would probably be you. But I’m sure you know I play a lone hand.
I always have and I always will. I know you are considered a world
expert on the cotton market, and I have admired your plays in the
market for a long time. But I play alone. It’s one of my rules.”

“Listen, young man, I have never seen a trader like you. How
you got out of the trap that Cutten set for you in that corn market
corner was amazing. Cutten was sure he had you. And how you
knew the boys in Chicago would go for that play in oats that
looked like the Armours were buyers? A master play, masterful!”
“It was a stroke of luck and good timing, that’s all.”
“A stroke of inspiration is more like it, and planting that article
in the World—Livermore corners the cotton market. Sheer bril-
liance my boy, sheer brilliance.”
“I didn’t plant that article. I was as surprised as anybody else
was. That’s why I like to play alone. I don’t like explaining my
moves to anyone, and I don’t take the time to complain if I’m
wrong. I simply don’t want to have anyone with me to whom I
have to explain my actions.”
“I understand and respect what you’re saying, J.L.” He paused.
“You know I got wiped out in March cotton, kicked right in the
ass, so I’m coming to you at a point of weakness in my life.”
“I have been down to rock bottom several times myself and
always risen again. You will too.”Livermore had brought along his
checkbook. He reached in his pocket and took it out, along with
a pen. “I would consider it an honor to help you out financially.
Just name the amount.”
“No sir, I thank you, but that’s not my aim. I lost because I don’t
have your trading savvy, your feel for the market, your timing. And
that is what I want, and why I want you to be my partner.”
“My position remains steadfast. I trade alone.”
There was a long pause as the Cotton King studied the young
Jesse Livermore in his black silk tuxedo. He smiled at the young
man. “No reason we can’t be friends, is there?”
“None at all. In fact, let’s have dinner tomorrow at the Break-
ers. I’ll introduce you to my friends.”

They had dinner the next night. They enjoyed each other’s
company at the Breakers bar, on the beach, and in the ballroom lis-
tening to the orchestra. Eventually they became inseparable
friends. The Cotton King and the Boy Plunger made quite a pair.
With the addition of Russell and Moore to the mix, the whispers
would cross the room like a soft tropical breeze whenever they
entered.
Thomas took special care to tutor Livermore on the cotton
markets—the entire history of cotton in America, including the
origin of worldwide demand for cotton and where the cotton
would come from to fill that ever-increasing demand. He
informed Livermore of the newly planted Egyptian cotton fields
and considered whether they would work and what effect they
would have on the overall world trade. It was a complete and thor-
ough advanced university-level education in cotton, taught by the
smartest, most acclaimed expert in the field.
Livermore listened, his brilliant mind absorbing every detail, but
there was a problem. He did not always agree with his learned
friend because he approached the subject differently. He looked
only at market action—the facts of the marketplace—not the fun-
damentals of the cotton industry. He did not care why things hap-
pened in the market, he cared only what happened every day
when the market opened. He was interested only in what the tape
told him—the current facts, the price.
Livermore also believed that the market did not operate on cur-
rent information—it already knew the present and was operating
on the future, on factors unknown at the time even to the experts.
The market was blending the future into the present. And he did
not believe the market operated on a fundamentally reasonable
basis. He believed it operated most often on an emotional basis;
reason did not prevail.

THE COTTON KING • 91 •
Livermore wrestled with a simple thought: The Cotton King
went broke. How could he go broke if he knew so much? Liver-
more also had gone broke;the difference was that he did not think
he knew everything. He observed that the market always did what
it wanted to do, not what it was expected to do. And the market
did it with no immediate explanations. But Livermore still listened
attentively, hoping he would learn something.
Livermore had always operated by himself in secrecy and
silence. He had developed rules of trading that had cost him dearly,
the Livermore laws for market trading. But no person is a robot,
always able to control all emotions, innermost drives, and fears and
hopes.
Despite his reservations, it was not long before Livermore was
under the Cotton King’s spell. Thomas believed everything that he
said, and he spoke with passion about his favorite subjects. He had
convinced Livermore of his honesty and sincerity when he refused
Livermore’s offer of money to get back on his feet.
The facts he gave about the cotton market were indisputable,
and they were logical. Livermore, on the other hand, had little
logic to offer on the behavior of the commodity markets. Liver-
more was a speculator who had been doing his job for 16 years. He
did not know cotton any better than he knew steel, coal, corn,
oats, wheat, or any other commodity. But he knew how the mar-
ket acted and reacted.
When Livermore checked some of the facts that Thomas
offered against actual market movements, he found that the King
often was correct in his predictions. He began to think: “Maybe
there’s something I’m missing in my trading. Maybe there is a bet-
ter way to analyze the movements of the markets.”
In addition, Thomas had proprietary ways of obtaining infor-
mation. He had thousands of spies throughout the South who



==================================================

• 92 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
reported to him on crop conditions. These facts were shown to
Livermore. The conclusions seemed obvious: It was clear which
way to trade the futures market, up or down, based on this secret
information associated with expected supply and demand. Every
good lawyer, philosopher, salesperson, or liar knows that the way
to convince someone is to get them to accept the basic facts, the
premises—then they will have no choice but to agree with the un-
deniable conclusions. Once Livermore accepted the truth of the
secret facts Thomas fed him from his secret reports, he had to
believe in the same conclusions as Thomas.
This episode became one of the biggest lessons in Livermore’s
life. It explains why he later would speak to no one, ever, about
what he was doing, and why he would ask people to keep their
trades and tips to themselves.
During this time he was also very friendly with Bernard
Baruch, who had experienced something similar. Baruch com-
mented, “If you know something about the stock I’m trading in,
something really, really important, please keep it to yourself. Don’t
tell me.” He added this quote to his boys’ market lessons.
When Livermore first met with Thomas, he was bearish on cot-
ton and he had a small short position. After talking to Thomas for
about a month, he reversed himself. Of course, Livermore often
reversed himself on his stock positions, using deductive reasoning:
“If I’m wrong in thinking a stock is going up and long that stock,
well then, I must be right if I go short because history has taught
me that if it doesn’t go up it will most probably go down.”
He plunged. He went for a line of 60,000 bales. Since he had
broken one of his primary rules about taking tips, playing another
person’s game, he then proceeded to break a few more.
Cotton moved against him, so, against his own rules, he bought
more, dollar averaging down, instead of selling out and perhaps
reversing his position. He also had a heavy line of wheat in which

==================================================

8467_Smitten_05_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:37 PM Page 93
THE COTTON KING • 93 •
he had a profit. He continued to buy cotton until he had accumu-
lated 150,000 bales.
Then he broke yet another rule. He was overextended on his
margin, so he sold the profitable wheat position and kept the los-
ing cotton position. Always sell the loser, keep the winner; he
knew the rule, but he did not act on it. As soon as he sold the posi-
tion, wheat went up 20 cents—a potential profit of $8 million and
a fact that upset his judgment even more. With his judgment
crumbling, his confidence soon followed. His erratic behavior
increased.
He bought even more cotton, thinking it was at the bottom, but
it was not. He had 440,000 bales in his account when the dawn
broke and he saw what a fool he was. He sold out his position. He
had lost his millions. He was left with less than $300,000 out of $3
million, a staggering loss of $2.7 million.
He had been seduced by the Cotton King and his logic, and he
had paid the price.
Livermore understood that Thomas did not benefit from this
personally. His magnetic personality was so persuasive that he had
mentally overpowered Livermore when he explained his interpre-
tation of the cotton market. Thomas had been the catalyst for Jesse
Livermore’s ruin this time.
But Livermore held no animosity for Thomas. He considered it
one more lesson learned. He had engaged in another form of tak-
ing tips, a lesson apparently not learned well enough the first time.
Thomas had presented what Livermore later thought of as slick
tips, because they were so well thought out, well presented, and
well intentioned;and Thomas did not personally benefit from his
information—very, very, seductive. Of course, the price tag was
basically $3 million a lesson.
Livermore had been a millionaire for less than a year. He was
forced to sell the Anita Venetianand the Riverside Drive apartment,

along with its beautiful furnishings. Why did he follow the lead of
Thomas, whom everyone knew had been busted in March cotton?
Was Livermore just a flash in the pan, like so many other Wall
Street boy wonders who made a killing and then got killed them-
selves? People who patrolled the canyons of Wall Street wondered
about the Boy Plunger: “What the hell happened to the Great
Trader?”
Livermore now needed money to rebuild his former position,
and he needed it fast. The emotions he felt over this loss caused him
to make another mistake, break another rule. Illogically, he wanted
the market to pay him back for his losses. So he went back into the
market with a vengeance, but his trading ability was shot. He was
an emotional wreck. Instead of returning to the market, he should
have gone away to get his emotional balance back. But convinced
he was the great trader everybody thought he was, he plunged back
into the market, losing the last of his stake. He then operated on
credit and went into debt to the people who backed him.
He finally tallied it up, months later. He owed his brokers and
creditors well over $1 million. He had lost his $3 million and
another million to boot. “Some operator,” he thought to himself.
“Some bad operator.”
It was an emotionally crippled, despondent Livermore who
stood on the track waiting for the train to Chicago. He was again
down to rock bottom. He planned to go to Chicago in search of
bucket shops, or to see if he could perhaps make a living from the
grain pits. He was confused and disgusted with himself. The only
thing he could be sure of was that he had to get out of New York
City, and he did.
In Chicago, Livermore suffered a complete emotional break-
down, a deep depression. He studied his book of trades and fell
deeper and deeper into the black hole. His last trades after the cot-
ton fiasco were erratic, almost like those of some other trader. He

was trading like a wild gambler, not even as well as he had as a
youth. His confidence was gone;he could not recover his equilib-
rium. Only a year before he could easily trade a line of 100,000
shares or more at his brokerage firm, $10 million of equities. He
would be lucky to deal in hundreds of shares now. He had been
lured away from his own trading methods, influenced by other
traders, and become so upset by his battering losses that his judg-
ment was now just no good. Worst ofall, his cocky confidence was
gone, the confidence in himself that he needed to survive. He did
not have the old attitude:“I made money before, and I shall make
it again.”
After several months ofdespair, Livermore finally summoned up
the courage to analyze his behavior and try to isolate what he had
done wrong. He finally had to confront the human side of his per-
sonality, his emotions and his feelings, which he had denied all his
life. He knew the technical side of the market, but he did not
know his emotions. Why had he thrown his market principles, his
trading theories, his hard-earned laws to the wind? His wild
behavior had crushed him financially and spiritually. Why had he
done it?
He finally realized it was his vanity, his ego. That day when he
had held the fate of the market in his hands, when the great J. P.
Morgan had asked him to stop shorting the market, had been too
much for him. This outstanding success, making more than $1
million in one day, had shaken him to his foundations. It was not
that he could not deal with failure—he had been dealing with fail-
ure all his life—what he could not deal with was success.
He had now learned that success is just as hard to deal with as
failure. Both can ruin a person. In Chicago he acquired a small
stake, borrowed from a friendly broker who knew Livermore’s
power to generate commissions and wealth.
His troubles were not over.

Years later, Livermore would recount this story to Ed Bradley, late
one night in the bar at the Beach Club after Bradley asked him
what was the worst experience he had ever had in his early days on
Wall Street:he later repeated this to his son Paul.
“A short time after I arrived in Chicago, maybe three months, I
got a telegram to come back to New York. It was from a friend of
mine who I will call Fred, the office manager of a large brokerage
firm. I called Fred and was told, ‘J.L., it will be worth your while
to come to New York. There is someone here who wants to talk
to you.’
“I caught the next train back to New York and had the most
incredible experience of my life. One that I would regret all my
life. When I arrived in the brokerage office in New York I was
immediately taken by Fred to meet the owner, a prosperous and
well-known man who I will call Charles.
“After the introductions, Fred excused himself. The owner of
the firm got right down to business. ‘Livermore, I’m very sorry to
hear of the trouble you suffered in cotton. I know you listened to
the Cotton King and he got you off your game. Percy means well.
He could sell ice cubes to Eskimos. He’s convincing. He can’t help
himself. He would have been a great politician. You are not the
first or the only one who has followed the Cotton King down the
slide. I know your trading history. I know about the panic of 1907
and how you handled yourself when Morgan sent his message to
you. It was all over the Street. Well, to make a long story short I’m
willing to back you.’ He reached in his pocket and pulled out his
checkbook and wrote a check for twenty-five thousand dollars.
‘Here, take this. It will get you started.’
“I looked at the check and then back at the man who had
handed it to me and asked, ‘What’s the catch?’
“‘The catch is I want you to do all your trading here, nowhere
else,’ he said.

“‘What if I lose it?’ I asked.
“‘I’ll give you more. You will win, and I will back you until
you win,’ he told me.
“‘I still don’t get it,’ I said.
“‘Well, I knew you wouldn’t. I’m not talking to you and back-
ing you because you are dumb. You are a secretive and silent kind
of trader, my kind of trader, so nobody knows how much money
you have left, or who your backers are,’ he said.
“‘You want a share of the profits for the stake?’ I asked.
“‘No, I’ll tell you exactly what I want. I have several large
investors who really carry the firm’s business, and I don’t want
people to know what they are doing. If you are in the house they
will not know who is making the trades. You are famous for trad-
ing in large lots, and for trading on the bear side, for your short
selling.’
“I was suspicious. ‘So I’ll be the cover story for any large trans-
actions that come out of this house, particularly on the selling
side.’
“‘Yes, exactly,’ he said.
“‘It would also be a way for your customers to sell large blocks
of stock into the market without it being noticed,’ I said.
“‘Yes, but that’s not going to interfere with what you are doing,
and it’s perfectly legal. Let them think what they want,’ he coun-
tered.
“I was desperate to get back in the action, so I banked the check
and started trading. I did well. It was a strong bull market, and in
three weeks the twenty-five thousand had grown to a hundred and
fifty thousand. Then I made my first big mistake. I went to
Charles, the owner of the brokerage house, and said, ‘Here’s the
twenty-five thousand I borrowed from you.’
“‘Keep it Livermore, wait until you have some real money in
that account, then you can pay me back,’ was his answer.

“This made sense to me. He was getting good commissions. I
carried on for a few more weeks. I liked Charles, my benefactor,
who was ready to back me when no one else would. I felt a moral
obligation to the man, a loyalty. More important, my malaise of
the spirit, my depression was lifting. My spirit was returning. I was
starting to be my old self again, and I was making money.
“Then I turned bearish on the market and sold ten thousand
shares of the Chesapeake and Atlantic railroad short. I was startled
the next day to be called into Charles’s office, and he told me, ‘J.L.,
I cancelled that ten-thousand-share sell order of yours yesterday,
and went long for you.’
“‘But I feel we are entering a downward-trending market,’ I
said.
“‘No, my boy, the president of that railroad is my brother-in-
law, married to my favorite sister. I know things that I can’t tell
you. The stock’s going up,’ he said.
“The stock fell, just as I had predicted, and my profits were
wiped out. Charles came to me:‘Don’t worry, J.L., I’ll help you
get that back. It may take a little time, but it’s bound to make a
recovery.’
“And just as he had told me, a little while later he returned with
a fistful of credit slips that brought my balance back to a credit. He
told me, ‘By the way, I’ve just bought you ten thousand shares of
Southern Atlantic, and put them into your account.’
“‘Isn’t that another railroad controlled by your brother-in-law?’
I asked.
“‘Yes it is, with great prospects for growth,’ he answered.
“The Southern Atlantic shares fell, and I was sold out in the
next few days, another loss. Again I heard, ‘Don’t worry, J.L.,
everything is going to be all right.’
“I made enough to stay alive, but not to pay off my substantial
prior indebtedness of over a million dollars.

“I finally figured out what was going on. My benefactor,
Charles, the owner of the brokerage house, was liquidating his
brother-in-law’s estate. His brother-in-law was one of the wealth-
iest men in America. It was common knowledge that the brother-
in-law was sick, incurable, and now after years of sickness, close to
death.
“I decided to talk to Fred, the man who had sent me the
telegram in Chicago, the office manager of the firm. I had a drink
with him one night and told him what I had figured out. I said, ‘I
believe I’ve been used as a foil, a red herring, a cover story by
Charles to liquidate his brother-in-law’s estate. So no one on the
Street would know or suspect what was going on while this big
estate was liquidated and there would be no deep loss in the price
of the estate stocks, particularly railroad stocks.’
“The office manager looked at me and said, ‘Yes, I guess that’s
true, and now that the estate is practically in cash I can tell you
about it.’
“‘So the money I received and the losses I incurred in my
account were chicken feed compared to what we are dealing with
here?’ I asked.
“‘Yes,’ he said.
“‘So I’m right. I was the firm’s decoy, the patsy, that kept
everybody on the Street from triggering to what was really going
on,’ I said.
“‘That was a small part of it,’ he said.
“‘What do you mean a small part, what else could it have
been?’ I asked.
“‘The boss knew we would be entering a bear market, sooner
or later. He knew you were a great trader. He saw what you did
here, in the first three weeks, before he started trading your
account for you. Yes, it was true it was good for him to have you
here as a smoke screen for what was really going on. That part is

true, but the main reason was he wanted you under the roof here
while he was liquidating,’ he explained to me.
“‘What do you mean? I still don’t understand,’ I said.
“‘Listen, J.L., when you were really back on your feet—and
you would be, sooner or later—nobody doubted that you would
be swinging a line ofat least two or three hundred thousand shares.
You would have picked up on the fact that there was a huge
amount of stock being distributed in those railroad stocks that
came from Charles’s brother-in-law’s estate. You would have trig-
gered to it and raided the hell out of those stocks, driving the
stocks down, and down, with one of those classic bear raids you’re
famous for, and Charles knew it,’ he said.
“I was flabbergasted. Because I had lost my confidence, I was
not looking for deeper motivations, darker motivations, more
intelligent motivations, like I would have normally. I had only seen
the surface behavior, not what was behind it. I had never consid-
ered the fact that by keeping me chained up in a cage I would not
be a factor in upsetting one of the largest stock distributions in his-
tory. Charles’s sister’s estate, when the trading was over, was valued
at over two hundred and fifty million dollars.
“I was shaken. I had acted out of gratitude to a man I thought
was backing me, helping me, and once again, like with the Cotton
King, I had unwittingly done another man’s bidding. A smart
man, a brilliant man, a man who could find the Achilles’ heel of
people and could use that weakness to his own benefit.
“What a shock! My benefactor had more confidence in my
trading ability than I had in myself!
“But I was not angry with Charles. He had operated for rea-
sons of his own. His sister was the ultimate beneficiary of the
estate, and he felt obliged to get the most money for her. I was just
a pawn in a more devious man’s game. What really disturbed and

upset me was that I had missed the action in a good market cli-
mate where I could have made up all my losses. Instead, I was still
deeply in debt. I had been used, but I had let myself be used by
not following one of my own rules—trade alone, and only for my
own account.
“I cleared out my desk that night and then walked into Charles’s
office and said, in my calmest voice, ‘I will no longer be trading in
this office.’
“Charles looked me in the eye and nodded, no expression on
his face. He knew that I had figured out his game. As I turned and
headed for the door, Charles said ‘We’ll miss you around here, J.L.’
“‘I’ll bet you will, Charles. I’ll bet you will,’ I said, closing the
door behind me.
“First Percy, the Cotton King, and then Charles, my alleged
benefactor. Was I ever going to learn my lesson?”
Livermore finished his old-fashioned and ordered another one.
He looked Ed Bradley, one of the most famous gamblers who ever
lived, in the eye and smiled. “It’s your turn, Ed. You heard my sad
story. Tell me one of yours.”
Both of these men were famous for their silent and secret lives,
but each felt easy with the other.
“All right, J.L., I’ll tell you one of mine.
“You know that I love horses, J.L. They are my real passion. I
don’t know why. I fell in love with horses when I went out west
to cure a mild case of tuberculosis. I got involved with those wild
and wooly characters that roamed the West in those days and
became a scout for the U.S. Army. I used to bet heavily on the
Indian pony races whenever I could find them, and later I actually
got involved in owning racetracks in New Orleans and Florida.
But it was the horses I loved. In fact, I prefer the company of
horses to people, present company excluded, J.L. I get my biggest

thrill from my farm in Kentucky: watching the colts being born
and seeing how they live out their bloodlines.
“One of my early great Kentucky Derby contenders was Blue
Larkspur. You know I’m superstitious, J.L., I guess all gamblers are.
All my horses’ names begin with a B because of my first great
horse—Bad News, because bad news travels fast! Anyway, Blue
Larkspur had won six of his seven races as a two-year-old and was
the even-money favorite for the derby. I bet a hundred and twenty-
five thousand on him to win. Then, before the race, the rains came
down at Churchill Downs. It poured for hours. I talked to the
trainer, and we decided to change Blue Larkspur into mud shoes.
“The race began. The gate slammed open, and Blue Larkspur
lost his footing right from the get-go. He slip-slid all over that
track, almost fell, coulda broke his leg. He finally got his footing
back and finished fourth out of twenty-one in the field.
“After the race, I went down to look at the horse and found that
his shoes had not been changed. The blacksmith had something
against the trainer, something about a woman they shared. Said he
was gonna change ’em to mud shoes when the trainer told him,
but instead he skipped right out the back door of Churchill
Downs. Could have killed Blue Larkspur.
“You just never know what the hell is going on in people’s
heads!”
Livermore pondered the story Bradley had told him. He finally
asked the old Indian Scout, “Ed, what happened to the black-
smith?”
“Now J.L., there’s a limit to what I’m willing to tell, and that’s
a story that nobody’s ever gonna hear.”
By 1910, Livermore was back in New York with a very small
stake. The power had left the long-running bull market, and there

was a general apathy on the Street. The action stagnated as the
market wandered in a sideways pattern, hard to read.
Livermore went from brokerage house to brokerage house over
the next four years. He was able to get lines of credit in various
houses, but he continued to trade badly. Still angry and resentful,
he was not able to trade with a clear mind, and he suffered badly
from his ever-present depression. He simply could not get his
emotional balance back.
He also wore the oppressive cloak of a person in debt. He was
at heart a New Englander. He had been taught as a boy:“Neither
a borrower nor a lender be.” He hated being in debt. The guilt lay
heavily on his shoulders. He believed people should pay off their
debts, and he was in deep debt to his friends—friends he saw every
day on the Street. Suicide even began to cross his mind as he sank
deeper into a seemingly bottomless depression.
He finally realized that he could give up and end it all, or he
could analyze his problem. He chose the latter.
The problem, as far as he could tell, was simply money—or the
lack thereof.
Livermore had built up a multimillion-dollar fortune from the
few dollars his mother had given him. What was keeping him from
doing it again? Charles had thought Livermore could do it—that
was why he had corralled Livermore while he disposed of his
brother-in-law’s fortune. Livermore concluded that he was not the
trader he once had been. His mind was not functioning properly,
could not function properly with all these constant dark thoughts
of debt and failure.
It was not the market’s fault. No matter what the market was
doing, he knew there were always situations to be found where
money could be made. It was the nature of the market never to be
still. There were always opportunities.

So what was his real problem? Why was his judgment bad? He
was depressed all the time. Why? He was depressed because he
owed money, mostly to his friends. He knew he could never trade
well again unless he lifted the black oppressive mantle of debt off
his shoulders.
He decided to go bankrupt. He had to free his mind of the
black thoughts that followed debt. He had to be clear minded to
trade and get back in business. He needed a new start.
He paid visits to each of his creditors before he went to see his
lawyer to file for bankruptcy. He promised to pay them back.
They smiled and shook his hand. “We know you’ll make it
square with us, J.L.,” they said to him. They, like Charles, had
more confidence in him than he had in himself. “We have no
doubt you will be back on your feet again. You’re not the first,
nor will you be the last, to be leveled by Wall Street. You get
yourself together. We’ll be waiting for you to trade again out of
our office.”
“I’ll pay you back what I owe you, every cent.”
“We know you will.”
“Yes sir, I will.”
“All right, now there is one thing,” many of them told him.
“What’s that?” Livermore asked.
“We will not be listing our debt in your bankruptcy. No sense,
Jesse, in making public what’s just between us, is there?”
With the exception of a few brokerage firms, most of his cred-
itors refused to file their debtor claims with the bankruptcy court.
It was still a horrific experience for Livermore. It was 1914, and
the Great War had just begun in Europe. The stock market was
closed from July 31 to December 15, 1914. Livermore was broke
and living in a second-rate hotel, the Bretton Hall at Broadway
and Eighty-sixth Street.

THE COTTON KING • 105 •
He visited his lawyer, who filed his bankruptcy petition.
Ashamed, he kept to himself and waited. On February 18, 1915,
he read a summary of the last five years of his life in the New York
Times:
Jesse L. Livermore, whose spectacular rise to fortune during
the panic of 1907, and his equally startling losses in cotton a
few months later, made him one ofthe well-known characters
in Wall Street. Yesterday he filed a voluntary petition for bank-
ruptcy in the Federal District Court. He gave Bretton Hall,
Broadway and Eighty-sixth Street, as his residence, and said he
owed $102,474. The value of his assets were unknown.
Mr. Livermore is only 38 years old, and from the age of 16
he has been a speculator. His chance came in 1906, when he
came to the conclusion that the market was on the down
grade. He began to sell short in Union Pacific, Reading,
Copper and Smelters, and in 1907 when the crest came he
covered his short contracts and made a comfortable fortune.
In the following August he was attracted by the high price
of cotton in Liverpool and scented another slump. He made
another big killing and by 1908 was credited with being
worth from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000.
In August 1908, however, the luck began to turn against
him. He was caught on the long side with 600,000 bales of
October cotton, and as the price broke 67 points, he was sup-
posed to have lost his fortune.
Livermore folded the newspaper, laid it on his dresser, rose from
his threadbare chair, and entered the small bathroom. He took his
time and dressed in his usual dapper manner. He walked down to
Wall Street, one of the longest walks of his life. He entered the

brokerage offices of Charles, his old benefactor, whom he had not
seen or spoken to in four years.
He had removed the cloak of debt;now he had to find out if he
could still trade. For Livermore there was only one way to deter-
mine if he had lost his touch—he had to lay his money on the line
and let the tape tell him if he was right or not. His chances were
running out, and he knew it.

LIVERMORE TOOK A FINAL DEEP BREATH AND WALKED
into the offices of his former benefactor. He was received imme-
diately and was seated facing Charles. The New York Times lay on
Charles’s desk;neither of them spoke of its contents.
“I need a line,” Livermore said, without any preamble.
Charles sat in silence, studying Livermore, keeping his thoughts
and emotions to himself. Both of them knew there was no need to
talk of the past.
“How much?” Charles asked.
“You decide.”
Charles stood and walked to his office window. It was 1915,
with a tricky wartime stock market in which a person could make
a fortune or lose one in a few minutes of speculation.
“All right, J.L., I’ll give you a line of five hundred shares. I’ll
authorize it today, to be put in your account. We kept your
account open, you know.”
“You thought I’d be back?”
“Maybe.”
“Thank you,” Livermore said. The two shook hands, and Liv-
ermore walked out of the office. It was a small line for a trader like
Livermore, but there was no restriction on the price of the shares.
With a $150 stock, he could put out a line of $75,000. It was a
start.
Now he had to decide what to do. He had only limited capital.
He could afford no losses. He was determined to stick to his old
trading rules, but it would be difficult to put out probes and buy
small positions to test his judgment. He had no room for mistakes;
this might be his last chance. His first trade must be profitable, yet
he could not let the pressure of his limited capital force him into
bad decisions. He concluded that the market was in a strong
upward trend, so he would trade on the upside, buy long. He also

knew that stocks tended to react positively when they crossed par
at 100, 200, or 300.
His failings, his frailties, were clearer to him;his limitations were
known, but they must not upset his confidence. He was anxious to
trade in this active wartime market. For this reason, he did not go
back to Charles’s brokerage firm. Instead, for six long weeks,
broke and living on a tiny amount of money, he studied the tape,
analyzing every trade as it crossed through the ticker. He knew that
if he went to the offices of his benefactor, where he had credit, he
might make a play and execute a trade in the heat of the action. He
did not want to do this. He wanted everything to be in his favor
for this first key trade, so he stayed out of temptation’s way, study-
ing the tape. He knew now that his biggest enemy was his own
emotions. Every trader had to face this sooner or later.
He needed every factor in his favor.
He finally chose Bethlehem Steel, an obvious choice in war-
time years, and a choice known to the trading public. Livermore
sat and watched the stock climb to 98, only 2 points from par—
100—and he felt that if the stock passed through 100, it would
skyrocket. He ran over to the brokerage house and bought 500
shares of Bethlehem Steel at $98. When the stock hit $114, he
boughtasecond500sharesonmargin,givinghim1,000shareson
the long side.
The next day the stock hit $145. Livermore closed out his Beth-
lehem Steel trade a few days later with over $50,000 of profit. This
meant he could exercise a line of $500,000, on 10 percent margin.
He was back in the game.
In the aftermath of his bankruptcy, he had no creditors to think
about, and now he had a decent line to trade with. His confidence
began to return. He could start to trade in his old manner, and he
did so with good success for the rest of the year. Putting together

a string of profitable trades, he brought his equity up close to
$500,000.
His only setback was the sinking of the Lusitania on May 7,
1915. Everyone believed the United States would enter the Great
War. The market plummeted on the news, and Livermore suffered
badly. He covered his positions quickly and finished out 1915 with
only $150,000 in equity in his account—not bad, considering. He
was definitely back in business, but more important, he had found
his trading form. He was now following his own rules and work-
ing hard to avoid his emotional flaws.
His ex-wife Nettie appeared in his life again after he started to
recover from his bankruptcy. He had seen very little of her since
their separation. He gave her a stipend of $1,000 a week to cover
her expenses, “To make up for the lean years,”he told her. He also
set her up with a good-sized home on Long Island and gave her
money to fill it with furniture and a car for the garage.
The United States did not enter the war after the sinking of the
Lusitania, as so many had predicted. The American people were
strong isolationists, who wanted nothing to do with a foreign war.
It did not take long for the market to recover. Livermore was now
trading in a full wartime economy bull market.
The United States was operating at full industrial capacity, ship-
ping out all the products the war-torn world needed, while gold
was being shipped to the United States by foreign nations to pay
for goods. Things were booming. All through 1916 Livermore
remained bullish, actively trading. But like bear markets, bull mar-
kets do not last forever, and Livermore started fishing for the top.
He kept his eyes on the market leaders, as he had done in 1906
and 1907, because he knew that when those leaders started to top
out and roll over, that would be the first signal to start preparing
for a bear market. He also knew that markets did not suddenly

change precipitously in either direction. They gave plenty of sig-
nals, clues, if he could read them objectively.
He compared market directions to advancing opposed armies—
the bull army and the bear army. When the leading divisions of the
army, in this case the leading stocks, started to get beaten down
and turned around, that was the time to light the caution lamp.
When they started to roll over and retreat, that was the time to
change the strategy, and start trading in the opposite direction. He
believed that the market leaders of the 1916 bull market gave
strong, if subtle, clues.
The market was like a smooth card player. It did not tip its hand
for everyone to see. Livermore had to be aware, astute, alert, ready
to read the signs, because on an early call for a major market turn
in trend, he would be going against public opinion—public opin-
ion that would still be seduced by the strong momentum of the
existing market. Livermore’s experience had taught him to stand
apart from the crowd at these major turning points in the market,
heading in the opposite direction. This had never bothered him,
because it was at these times that he made his greatest money.
He reverted to his time-tested technique of sending out probes,
buying small positions to see if he was correct in his assessment of
the market. Slowly he took positions in 12 stocks, including the
market leaders Steel, Baldwin, American Can, General Motors,
Chrysler, and Anaconda Copper. He sold short a total of 60,000
shares, which was a reasonably modest position for him by this
time. He waited, and the tape dropped about four points across the
board. He knew he was right, doubled his position to 120,000
shares, and waited.
It was at this time that a scandalous leak came out of Washing-
ton, claiming that President Woodrow Wilson had issued a peace
offering to Germany and the Allies to end the war. The market

tumbled on the good news, because peace in Europe would kill
the healthy wartime economy of supplying foreign nations. Liver-
more had a steadfast rule that if something serendipitous, an
unplanned windfall, should occur, he must capitalize on it and not
be greedy—accept his good fortune and close out his position.
Livermore also had 120,000 shares of stock to sell, which was a
hefty position to liquidate in the 1916 market.
The leak occurred on the morning of December 20, 1916. Liv-
ermore was back in Palm Beach;having recouped his fortune, he
could afford to vacation in his favorite spot again. He had wan-
dered into the offices of Finlay, Barrel and Company. He had no
account with this broker. He was just watching the tape and read-
ing the newspapers when he was shown a private telegram from
the home office of Finlay, Barrel.
“Look at this telegram, Mr. Livermore,” the office manager
said.
“Wilson to offer peace to warring parties, later today,” Liver-
more read out loud. The wire came from a Washington reporter
named W. W. Price, whom Livermore had heard about. “You
think this is on the level?” Livermore asked the clerk.
“I think so, yes sir,” the office manager said.
Livermore thanked the manager, went to one of his own Palm
Beach brokers, the E. F. Hutton office, and asked if they had heard
anything about the news of a peace offering from President Wil-
son. They said no. He called Ed Hutton in New York. Hutton said
he had not heard anything. Livermore watched the market weaken
in front of his eyes. He ordered lunch sent in and set to watching
the market.
A little after 1 P.M., E. F. Hutton’s telegraph department sent an
urgent flash telegram to all of the company’s officers. It said the
same thing as the wire that Livermore had already read in the Fin-
lay, Barrel offices earlier that morning. Livermore checked the

major wire services, but there was no news about President Wil-
son offering a plan for peace to Germany.
But the rumorof peace in Europe had been born, and the market
started to sag as people started to unload before the news became
known to the public. Then it looked as if the rumor was going to
be confirmed, and the market really started to plummet—soon the
news ofpossible peace was on everyone’s lips. Bids were pulled, and
prices sank.
Bernard Baruch, a friend of Livermore’s, was heavily involved in
the action. He had been short, like Livermore, and he was pound-
ing away on the short side, selling into any situation that still looked
good to him. But Livermore was looking to cover his short position
of 120,000 shares, and so at 2 P.M. he became a buyer of stock. He
had covered all his shorts by 3 P.M. and the close of business.
Baruch had made a substantial profit recently—over $3 mil-
lion—with the bulk of it coming during this sudden sell-off fol-
lowing the rumors out of Washington.
A congressional committee was formed to investigate the leak.
Baruch admitted to the committee that he had used the leak to
trade war stocks, but maintained that he had made a profit of only
$465,000.
Livermore, on the other hand, explained to the committee that
he was often short the market and that he had established his
120,000-share position seven weeks before the Wilson peace pro-
posal because he felt that the market had topped out.
He was subpoenaed on February 1. The next day the New York
Times quoted him. “How could I have known that far back that
President Wilson was going to make a peace offering to Germany
to end the war? I doubt if the president himself knew seven weeks
ago that he was going to offer a proposal of peace.”
As a result of this famous incident, the New York Stock
Exchange changed its rules and banned traders from acting on

news leaks, an idea which, though laudable, was completely unen-
forceable.
It was at this crucial juncture that something strange again hap-
pened to Livermore. He told both his sons the story, years later,
one night at dinner:
“I was seeing some friends off at Grand Central Station. I
walked with them to my private railway car, which I was loaning
to them, to take them down to Palm Beach. The porter walked
beside us pushing the trolley with their luggage. When we got to
the car, my friend reached over to pick up his wife’s jewelry case
from the trolley, and his hat fell off and rolled under the car. The
porter reached under the car to pick up the Stetson homburg from
the tracks, and he handed it to me to give to my friend. I looked
down at the upturned hat. In the hatband there were initials in
gold, ‘W.A.R.,’ for Warren Augustus Reed, my friend’s initials.
“Well, that was a message to me, boys, a sign, and I raced back
to the office and started selling in earnest. I already was short the
market, but now there was no question in my mind, war was com-
ing to the United States.”
Four months later, on April 6, 1917, the United States joined
the Allies in the great European war. The people of the United
States had initially been against entering directly into a European
war, but they had agreed to supply the Allies with war goods and
armaments. However, after a series of incidents involving the Ger-
man policy of unrestricted submarine warfare and the sinking of
U.S. ships, the United States finally entered the fray and declared
war on Germany.
Near that time in early 1917, Livermore made one of his proudest
walks down Wall Street. He departed from his new offices at 111
Broadway, stopped at each of his creditors, and wrote checks pay-
ing off all his bankruptcy debts in full.

BACK ON HIS GAME • 115 •
“Let me add some interest to the amount I owe you,” Liver-
more offered, but each creditor refused. They simply accepted the
checks, smiled, shook his hand, and wished him luck for the
future. It was another act that added to his legend on Wall Street.
Livermore was 40 years of age. He decided to make a few
changes in his life. He established a $500,000 trust fund for him-
self, which would spin off an income of $30,000 a year. He would
never be poor again.
Livermore was also about to fall in love.
Flo Ziegfeld was a close friend of Livermore’s. Ziegfeld was the
creator of the Ziegfeld Follies, featuring beautiful women, beautiful
sets, and beautiful music. The legendary staging of scantily clad
women carrying exotic fans, parading around magnificent sets, up
and down elaborate staircases, was an extravagant spectacle. It was
the hottest show on Broadway.
One day Ziegfeld called Livermore. “J.L., I have someone you
just have to meet. A little brunette that lights up any room she’s in.
You need to meet her, J.L., she’ll light up your boring life. It must
get boring making all that money. You know, all work and . . .”
“Too much play makes a man poor.”
“We only pass through these earthly portals one time, J.L. We
are not here for a long time, so it should be a good time.”
“I’m not arguing, Flo.”
“Well, I’m having a little soiree at my apartment tonight. She’ll
be there. Will you, J.L.?”
“Yes, Flo, I’ll be there.”
That night, Livermore walked into Ziegfeld’s magnificent pent-
house apartment in Manhattan and promptly fell in love with
Dorothy Wendt. She was small, a brunette, with the most gor-
geous hazel-green eyes he had ever seen—they were piercing and
laughing at the same time. She sat with half a dozen people
around her, entertaining them all with her lively chatter. Ziegfeld

marched through the little crowd and introduced Livermore to
her.
Livermore was hooked. He went to all her shows, wined her
and dined her all over New York. They fell in love, the dashing
financier and the beguiling, beautiful showgirl, a storybook
romance.
Livermore had finally found someone whom he was desperate
to marry. But he remained married to Nettie, and now he had to
get a divorce. He thought that because he had given her a $1,000-
a-month stipend and bought her a house and a car, she would
accommodate him in his request for a divorce. He was wrong. The
divorce quickly became acrimonious. Livermore was in the chips
again, and Nettie knew it. She also knew he was in love with
another woman. She struck in the courts.
The one thing Livermore did not want to lose in the divorce
was his black Rolls-Royce, which he had kept for himself all these
years. But he had made the mistake of parking the car in her
garage, and she was not giving it up. “It’s mine” was her simple
explanation when he asked for it.
Livermore went to W. Travers Jerome, the famous former district
attorney for New York County. Jerome was a private investigator
who cut an impressive figure, solidly built, full of self-confidence,
and sporting a slick handlebar moustache. He was famous for his
well-chronicled prosecution of one of the most infamous murder-
ers of the twentieth century—Harry K. Thaw—for the murder of
the famous New York architect Stanford White.
Thaw, heir to a vast Pittsburgh rail and coal fortune, shot White,
an architect and New York society darling, in the RoofTheater of
Madison Square Garden—a building White had designed—in
plain view of hundreds of people. Thaw’s wife, showgirl Evelyn

Nesbit, had told her husband that White, her former lover, had
once raped her.
The shooting occurred on the evening of June 25, 1906, during
the presentation of the musical Mamzelle Champagne. When the
cast started singing “I Could Love a Million Girls,” which Nesbit
described as a “putrid number,” Thaw rose and walked over to
White’s table. He took a pistol from his belt and fired three shots
into White’s head. He then held the smoking pistol in the air to
signal that he was done. He calmly walked back to his own table
and sat down. He was immediately arrested and disarmed by a fire-
man on duty in the Garden.
Lying dead, slumped on his table, head in a pool of blood, face
blackened by powder burns, shot into oblivion, was America’s
most famous architect.
The Thaw trial became the first “trial of the century” involving
the rich and decadent, with a courtroom drama that elicited wild,
frenzied press coverage. With its exposure of wealth and incredible
indulgence, topped off with intimate sexual details, this trial began
the practice of mass media coverage of celebrity indiscretions.
White’s “red velvet swing,” on which he liked to have women
wearing no undergarments sit and swing in front of him so he
could look underneath their dresses, was just one of the sexual
details exposed.
Nesbit told the court that White had often beaten her with a
whip and had originally met her in his apartment, where he
immediately drugged her with champagne and ravished her. She
admitted she had sat naked in White’s famous red velvet swing
while he pushed her so high that her toes touched a Japanese para-
sol attached to the ceiling. She never properly explained why she
returned to White, her former lover, so often after she had become
involved with Thaw.

The trial also marked the beginning of great defenses by great
lawyers. Delphin Delmas, Thaw’s lawyer, offered the “Dementia
Americana” defense, which he defined as an affliction of the
American male whose wife’s purity has been violated.
There were two trials, and Thaw was eventually found innocent
by reason of insanity. Thaw spent the rest of his life in and out of
insane asylums.
Nesbit lived the rest of her life continually retelling the story of
that famous night. She died at the age of 82. Her last words:
“Stanny White was killed in 1906, but my fate was worse. I lived.”
Livermore visited Jerome, gave him a duplicate set of keys and his
power ofattorney, and instructed him to go out to Long Island and
repossess the Rolls when Nettie was not around.
On September 7, 1917, Nettie Livermore had the famous
lawyer Jerome arrested in Oyster Bay, Long Island. The police
actually put Jerome in the lockup. His partner Isidore Kresel
quickly bailed him out on a $2,000 bond. Putting Jerome in jail
was a mistake. He was angry. He called Livermore, and they
decided to tail Nettie.
A few weeks later, on September 22, there was a circus atmo-
sphere at the courthouse for the initial hearing on the case. Justice
of the Peace Allison Lowndes immediately began the proceedings.
“Is Mrs. Livermore in court with us?” she asked.
“I’m afraid Mrs. Livermore is ill, your honor,” her attorneys,
Frank Acer and Frank Davis, offered. “We would request an
adjournment to a later date.”
“Your honor, I beg to differ,” Jerome said, rising. “I know for a
fact that Mrs. Livermore was in New York last night and returned
to her home in Long Island at one o’clock this morning. There’s
nothing really wrong with her.”
“I want Mrs. Livermore here, and quick, or I’ll throw out this

case,” the judge said. This was reported in the New York Times the
next day.
Ten minutes later Nettie Livermore walked into court with an
entourage of her sister, her father, and two friends. The judge
asked how Jerome had obtained the car, and she was told that Tra-
vers had a key to the garage and to the car.
Mrs. Livermore took the stand next.
“What makes you think the car belongs to you, Mrs. Liver-
more?” the judge asked.
“Mr. Livermore told me when he bought it. He said, ‘Chick,
this car belongs to you.’”
“How long have you been married to Mr. Livermore?”
“Eighteen years, but we have been separated for a long time.”
“Have you paid for any of the upkeep of the car?” the judge
asked.
“No.”
“Is the bill of sale or the ownership in your name?”
“No.”
“Did you know that Mr. Jerome had the power ofattorney from
your ex-husband to seize the car?”
“Yes.”
“Prior to your divorce, how much were you receiving as an
allowance for living?”
“A thousand dollars a week, Your Honor.”
“Mrs. Livermore, Officer Bowker says he values the car at
twenty-five thousand dollars. Are you aware of that, and do you
agree?”
“Yes, Your Honor.”
“But this bill of sale to Mr. Livermore says ten thousand dollars.
Are you aware of that also?”
“Yes, Your Honor.”
“It seems you’re aware of everything, Mrs. Livermore. I see no

merit in your case so I’m dismissing it.” The judge’s gavel fell and
the case was dismissed.
In an article in the New York Times on September 23, Jerome
said:“The officer must have described the wrong car. Perhaps the
twenty-five-thousand-dollar Rolls-Royce he had in mind is the
model they make out of solid gold. And I don’t think Mr. Liver-
more would ever say ‘Chick, this car belongs to you,’ not the Jesse
Livermore I know.”The press reporters loved Jerome and he loved
them, and they were already fascinated by the secretive Wall Street
legend, Livermore.
Things were going well for Livermore, and he showed his love for
Dorothy Wendt by purchasing a large emerald stone set in a plat-
inum ring on September 24, 1917. The reported price of the ring
was $120,000. It was purchased in Palm Beach. This was to be the
beginning of a massive collection of jewelry he would buy
Dorothy over the years to come.
The next day, Livermore also purchased a very large speedboat,
which he called the “sub catcher.” The boat was based in Palm
Beach and Key West.
Livermore was also receiving wide acclaim. He was grouped
together with Bernard Baruch as one of the “new breed” of stock
market speculators. The New York Times ran an editorial on this
subject on May 13, 1917. The headline read: “Exit the Swash-
buckling Trader of Wall Street:Present Day Speculator in Stocks Is
More of a Student and Economist Than the Sensational Manipu-
lator of Other Years.”
They speculate in Wall Street these days in a way different
from the methods employed in the free and easy times of
John W. Gates, and his coterie of wealthy plungers. “Bet a

Million” Gates was a leader who had a blind following in the
stock market, convinced that he would make them all rich.
There is no leader anymore. James R. Keene was the last of
this class of great operators whose bull-like crushing tactics,
supported by much money, swung the market up or down.
No one could charge Bernard M. Baruch with making a
display of his stock market efforts. Before the congressional
committee which investigated the “leak” of last December,
Baruch referred to himself as an investor and speculator in the
same manner as any other man would have spoken of his gro-
cery business. He informed the committee, with no more
enthusiasm than he might have shown in discussing the
weather, that he made $467,000 on the short side of stocks in
the month of December.
His reasons for selling stocks when he did, illustrated the
new epoch in speculation. He believed merely that prices
were too high. Study of the speculative situation persuaded
him that the market was about ready for a break.
Jesse Livermore is another operator whose work attracts
little attention while he is about it. In a way, Livermore is a
relic of the old days, without any of the trimmings. His busi-
ness is his own affair, and he has never been known to make
efforts to influence the market by whispering into the ears of
his friends. He harkens back to the past only in the sizes of his
purchases and his short selling.
Livermore, the story goes, began selling stocks short last
November, a month before prices started to move off. Prac-
tically every other trader was buying enthusiastically while he
was selling short. He sensed the market tendency to head
lower and stood unmoved amid a shower of optimistic refer-
ences. When the break finally came, he is said to have been
short of stocks between 50,000 and 60,000 shares, on which

a profit running into the hundreds of thousand dollars
accrued.
Baruch and Livermore stand forth as examples of bona fide
speculators of the largest caliber. The impression they made
on the market of last year however, was only a fraction of the
influence which came from a source which is difficult to
characterize either as speculative or investment.
A combination of the two might be ascribed to dealings in
the war market by the Du Pont group of gun-powder-
making-millionaires and W. C. Durant of the General
Motors Company. Possessed of great and steadily growing
incomes these men put their money to work to great advan-
tage. “Buy and hold stocks for an extraordinary rise.”
About the middle of 1915 Wall Street heard that the Du
Ponts were putting much of their inflowing wealth into stock
of the Baldwin Locomotive Company, the General Motors
Company, and the other concerns whose shares, then rela-
tively low, rose to unusual heights in the later frenzy of war
speculation. These rumors did not meet with denial, and
afterward came reports that great profits had been taken
around top levels. Baldwin rose from 26 that year to 154, and
General Motors advanced from 82 to 558, going in 1916 to
well above 700.
Durant, president of General Motors, has the reputation
among his friends of possessing imagination which could
make him a leading figure in speculation if he desired to be
one. But he has never appeared in the limelight of stock mar-
ket affairs, although it is known that he has seen tremendous
profits accrue on stocks bought at low figures. He buys long
before the public sees the speculative merit of the stocks
involved. He is said to possess supreme confidence in his own
judgment; when he decides to accumulate stocks he buys

them and no changes in market conditions of a temporary
sort disturb him.
It is said Durant seldom sells what he buys because his
judgment tells him that they are good. This is investment
buying.
Livermore never commented on what other people said in the
newspaper if he could help it, no matter what the press published.
He stayed silent on this issue, too. Livermore the mystery man only
hopped up the press more.
For the rest of 1917, Livermore did well, except for a lone coffee
trade.
Livermore saw the prices of all commodities rising as the
United States crept closer and closer to what he believed was
inevitable—U.S. involvement in the war roaring in Europe. When
the United States finally joined the war, commodities rose 100 to
300 percent in price. The only commodity that did not rise was
coffee, so Livermore investigated. The European markets had
closed, and now all coffee was being shipped to the United States.
The price of coffee was actually below its prewar level. Livermore
felt that the efficient German submarine force would continue to
sink freighters, which would eventually stop the flow of coffee
into the United States. As a result, prices would rise. It seemed
simple enough.
Livermore started buying coffee in the winter of 1917. Nine
months later, the price was flat, and he closed out his options at a
big loss. He went back into the market, where he sent out more
probes, buying more futures. He still believed he was right. This
time he was proven right—the price rose. He increased his posi-
tions as the price rose steadily. He was already counting his extra
paper millions when he got a big surprise.

• 124 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
The people who were on the other side of the coffee market,
the short sellers, knew they would take a huge hit when they had
to settle up because of the high price. They went to Washington,
and convinced those in power that the coffee drinkers of America
should be protected.
They told the wartime Price Fixing Committee that Livermore
had cornered the entire coffee market and was about to take the
prices sky-high. The committee immediately fixed on a maximum
price and established a limited time to close out all positions in the
commodity futures market.
The committee also closed the coffee exchange. Livermore did
what he was forced to do. He sold out his positions. His millions
in profits drained away like a cup of coffee disappearing down a
thirsty gullet. The Livermore lesson was explained in the press:
“America needs its cheap caffeine fix and the government agrees!”
But this taught Livermore another valuable lesson:Once again
he was right, but he did not profit from it. So now he added the
unexpectable to his list of stock market pitfalls. There was nothing
he could do under these conditions but lick his wounds and carry
on. There were some things that he could not predict, and there-
fore he could not guard against them. He could only react.
Livermore also was convinced that there was no one powerful
enough to control or fix a market for long. If the market was
driven to excess in either direction, it would always eventually
return to its true value.
If a stock was raided, the stock would go only so low before the
insiders, who knew its true value, stepped in to buy, joined by
astute investors, who also knew a bargain when they saw one. In a
free market, the proper price would always eventually be restored.
Livermore also came up with a method of watching stocks that
had broken badly on the downside: He watched for the rebound.
When the stock reached its ultimate decline—its nadir—it would

rebound strongly, swiftly, and head back up to prior levels, if in fact
the break had truly just been a raid and there was nothing inher-
ently wrong with the stock. Conversely, if the stock just lan-
guished after the break in price, wallowing along in a tight
sideways channel, this was a signal that there might be an inherent
weakness in the stock. It would probably keep following the line
of least resistance and go down some more. Livermore watched for
the deciding move in the trend before he made his own move.
Livermore’s other stock and commodity trades in 1917 were
very successful. Since he was considered the mightiest bear on Wall
Street, he often got blamed for price breaks in stocks that looked
like bear raids. Because of these price drops, he was also accused of
being unpatriotic, regardless of whether he was guilty. Mostly, Liv-
ermore concluded, it was an easy way to explain away the erratic
movement of a wartime stock market.
In October 1917, Livermore was finally legally divorced from
Nettie in Reno, Nevada. How did he do it? He simply gave her
what she wanted. He gave her his $500,000 personal trust fund
and the house he had purchased in Long Island for her, with all its
furnishings. He was not worried. He still had millions in his trad-
ing account. He was also clear of over $1 million in debt that he
had repaid, even though he had had no legal responsibility to do
so. He was finally free and clear of all encumbrances, and free to
trade on his own terms. Free to enjoy life again.
Livermore did not care about the money for Nettie. He let it all
go with no angry feelings toward her, he was so sure of his ability
to make more money again. He kept his railway car, his Rolls, and
his yacht. He believed that as long as he had a stake, he would sim-
ply eventually make up in the market whatever he had given to her.
On December 2, 1918, Livermore married Dorothy Wendt in
the St. Regis Hotel. Magistrate Peter B. Barlow performed the

brief ceremony. She was 18, he was 41. She looked beautiful in her
wedding dress. He stood tall and straight, his blond hair slicked
back, his black tails fashioned perfectly from the finest cloth, a
smile on his face, as he slipped the wedding band on her finger.
Later, in the bridal suite, Dorothy read aloud the inscription
inside her wedding band: “Dotsie, for ever and ever, J.L.” Years
later, it still made her blush and tingle with excitement.
This was a major moment for Livermore. He was happy. This
time—unlike 1907, when he had everything going for him only to
lose it—he would try to deal properly with his success. He vowed
that his hubris, conceit, and vanity would be kept under control.
He would not lose his head. He had already plunged into those
dark chasms of depression and grief. He would strictly follow his
hard-earned rules, his laws for trading the market. He would not
be careless and lose his fortune this time.
Livermore loved Dorothy. He was ready to settle down and start
a family, a family he could be proud of. But he was to find out that,
as in his adventure in the coffee market, in life there is the unex-
pected and then there is the unexpectable. He would come face to
face with the unexpectable years later, when Dotsie would shoot
their son.

LIVERMORE WANTED TO SUPPLY HIS YOUNG BRIDE
Dorothy with everything a woman could desire. The day after they
were married, Livermore showed Dorothy their new home, a
beautifully furnished townhouse at 8 West Seventy-sixth Street. It
was filled with the best of the best:beautiful rugs from Persia, the
finest Wedgwood dishes, and glistening crystal glasses. The works
of great artists hung on every wall. The bedrooms were sumptu-
ous—Egyptian cotton sheets, pillows filled with pure goose down
and covered in silk cases, and feather-filled duvets. The bathrooms
all had new fixtures and fittings, including oversized tubs that still
looked small in the huge space.
Dorothy was from a well-to-do background, but this over-
whelmed her. This was the pure luxury reserved for the very few.
She ran from one room to the next, each one better than the last.
Livermore stood proudly in the expansive living room, waiting for
her to complete her inspection. It was extravagant, but he could
easily afford this home.
They celebrated with vintage champagne chilled in a silver
Tiffany ice bucket, sipped from Waterford crystal glasses. There
was nothing too good for his new love, nothing at all. She looked
dazzling in the white gossamer cotton dress she wore, imported
from Paris. She stood glowing in the New York morning, sunlight
streaming through the clear glass of brand-new windows.
And when he was not with her, he was doing what he loved,
what brought all his nerve endings to life—trading the market.
Livermore loved the fact that in trading the market there was no
end to the learning process. The game was never over, and he
could never know enough to beat the market all the time. The
puzzle could never be solved. He had learned this lesson the hard
way, and that was why he never considered himself a market mas-
ter. He always considered himself a market student who occasion-
ally traded correctly.

PERFECTING HIS MARKET THEORY • 129 •
Around this time, on January 2, 1920, Livermore purchased a
seat on the New York Curb Exchange for $5,000. It was never
clear why he did this, since he was never seen trading on the curb.
He was also never seen inside the New York Stock Exchange.
Livermore’s understanding that he would be a student of the
markets all his life was exactly what drew him to the profession. It
was never the same;no day was like any other. The market was a
fast track where fortunes were made and lost in a heartbeat. Any-
one could be a winner if they made the right moves.
Among the most mysterious parts ofthe puzzle were what other
people called Livermore’s hunches. But these were not impulsive
moves as far as he was concerned;they just looked that way to the
uninformed observer. His actions were simply a result of his entire,
conscious and unconscious, mind at work—distilling facts;churn-
ing information;recalling prior events;reacting to current events;
watching his fellow traders; and, most of all, relying on his own
judgment, not the judgment of others.
All his life, Livermore spent a lot of time trying to understand his
subconscious mind, the mind that never sleeps. He studied Freud
and Jung. He knew the power and mystery ofthe inner mind. It was
the wellspring of creative expression. It was the land of mystifying
dreams. It was free-ranging, pure random-access thought. Could the
subconscious hold deeper answers? Could it be harnessed?
Livermore’s swift, seemingly instinctive actions on certain occa-
sions were to become part of his Wall Street legend. People often
observed these actions, and many later declared that he acted on a
sixth sense—a trader’s instinct, or gambler’s luck—or that he
received subliminal messages from the tape, reserved only for him.
Livermore himself did not fully understand some of his actions.
He had been trading from the age of 14. He was now 41—27
years of trading, with millions and millions of dollars passing
through his accounts. Livermore read Aristotle. He believed the

great philosopher’s dictum that “We are the sum total of our expe-
rience.” It was this pure, real-life experience, distilled through
intellect, that fascinated Livermore. Some people called it intu-
ition. Could it ever be understood, captured on a regular basis?
One evening at Bradley’s Beach Club in Palm Beach, Liver-
more was sitting with Ed Bradley for dinner, just the two of them.
After dessert Bradley asked him, “J.L., what makes a good stock
speculator?”
“Ed, that’s a funny question. What makes a good gambler?
Maybe similar traits?”
“I think maybe they’re a little different, J.L.”
“Well, for a stock speculator it’s an aptitude for the game, a
stomach for the ride, and the ability to see what is happening
without emotion. The ability to make observations that others
don’t and a good memory to remember facts correctly, particularly
mathematical facts.
“Finally, Ed, and most important, is experience. To learn from
your experiences is paramount. And you need them all. A specu-
lator could have good powers of observation and memory, but not
the experience. Or a trader could have experience, but poor mem-
ory or poor observational ability, or no mathematical aptitude. A
successful trader needs all these characteristics, but the key one—
the essential one for sustained success—I believe is experience.”
“And the stomach for it,” Bradley added.
“Yes, it’s not everybody’s calling. Not everybody could or
should be a speculator.”
“Or a gambler, like me. But can you be a little more specific
J.L.?”
“I’ll make it quick. Only speculate if you can make it a full-time
job. Don’t take tips of any kind, no matter where they come from.
Don’t worry about catching the tops or bottoms, that’s fool’s play.
Keep the number of stocks you own to a controllable number. It’s

hard to herd cats, and it’s hard to track a lot of securities. Take your
losses quickly and don’t brood about them. Try to learn from them,
but mistakes are as inevitable as death. And only make a big move,
a real big plunge, when the majority of factors are in your favor.”
“Kinda like holding a royal flush?” Ed Bradley smiled.
“In the market you very rarely get a sure thing. The market
always keeps you on the edge.”
“Gambling too, J.L.”
“That’s why every once in a while you must go into cash, take
a break, take a vacation. Don’t try to play the market all the time.
It can’t be done, too tough on the emotions. And finally, and I
know you’ll like this one Ed, keep some cash in reserve. Like you,
Ed—you probably have a hundred grand on you right now.”
“Eighty.” Bradley smiled.
“I have made some of my biggest moves and biggest profits
because I had some cash sitting in reserve.” Livermore smiled
back. “Now it’s your turn Ed. What makes a good gambler?”
“Pretty much what you just said, J.L.”
“There must be something else.”
“Well, J.L., you know I’m a good Catholic and I never discuss
religion, but the fear and love of God was put in me by my mother
from when I could talk till I was about twelve or thirteen and I hit
the road. So a good gambler always wants God on his side. Second,
you live in a nice gentlemanly world up there on Wall Street. At
least no one is beating you up or trying to shoot you, which, sad
to say, often happens in the life of a gambler. I believe a man must
know the manly art of self-defense, not to be a bully but so he
doesn’t ever have to have any fear of another person.”
“The men on Wall Street do all their maiming and killing men-
tally and financially,” Livermore added.
“Yeah and through lying, stealing and cheating, which I will not
abide.” Bradley sipped his drink and continued, “Finally, like the

market, you gotta do and love the math. So while others are talking,
and talking, and talking, like they always do, you can be thinking
and thinking and thinking, figuring the percentages and the proba-
bilities. This will ensure a fella of financial success—like you, J.L.”
“Ed, flattery will get you everywhere with me.” Livermore
raised his old-fashioned and Bradley raised his glass of soda water.
They smiled and clinked glasses, the Great Bear of Wall Street and
America’s most successful gambler.
Livermore’s winters in Palm Beach were more than a vacation.
They took him away from New York and the market. Even though
he often played the market from E. F. Hutton’s Palm Beach office,
it was different for him, because it was a different environment.
Plus, the Atlantic Ocean fascinated him. It made him feel small.
His life fell into better focus when he got out onto the ocean.
Some of his greatest thinking was done fishing, trolling along the
100-fathom bar a few miles off Palm Beach, following the great
underwater canyon that ran from Cuba to Nova Scotia, a nautical
highway for the great gypsy fish. Or cruising easily on his new
Anita Venetian II, heading down to Key West for some tarpon fish-
ing, and watching those great Florida Keys sunsets. The ocean was
always exciting, ever changing, and it refreshed his soul.
In the 1920s, Livermore made another important discovery that
he applied to his trading strategy: industry group movements. He
deduced from observation that stocks did not move alone when
they moved. They moved in industry groups. If U.S. Steel rose,
then sooner or later Bethlehem, Republic, and Crucible would
follow along. Livermore observed this time and time again, and it
became an important trading tool in his arsenal. As Figures 7.1 and
7.2 illustrate, nothing has changed since Livermore’s day. The
automotive group—here, General Motors and Ford—basically
moves in lockstep.

PERFECTING HIS MARKET THEORY • 133 •

The group movement premise was quite simple to Livermore.
He explained to his son Paul: “If the basic reasons are sound for
U.S. Steel’s business to come into favor in the stock market, then
the rest of the steel group should also follow for the same basic rea-
sons. This, of course also works for the short side of the market.
When a group goes out-of-favor for basic, solid reasons it will
include all the stocks in that industry group.”
For example, Figures 7.3 and 7.4 show companies in the “oil
patch” group. As the price of oil plummeted in the late spring of
1998, stock prices of Transocean and Triton Energy, both offshore
oil drillers, plummeted because their profit margins were threat-
ened. In fact, all the oil drillers suffered a steep drop in the price of
their stocks.
It was also an important clue for Livermore if a particular stock

in the favored group did not move up and prosper with the others.
This could indicate that the stock was weak or sick, and therefore
might be a good short sale. At the very least, a trader should be
cautious in buying any stock that does not follow the overall group
action.
This works in reverse, as well—if the group is going down, and
one stock is bucking the trend and going up, then the speculator
should beware.
The only exception to group movement is when a single stock
makes up 50 percent or more of the total sales of the group—
sooner or later, the rest of the group must follow this stock. For
example, Figures 7.5 and 7.6 show charts for Lucent, a leading
telecommunications company, and for the overall telecommunica-
tions equipment and service group. It is clear how important the

dominant stock is to this group—in fact, in such cases, the leading
stock is the group.
Livermore believed in trading the market leader, trading the
most powerful stock in the group. He didn’t look for the bargain,
the weak sister;he went with the leader, the anchor of the group.
He also noted that this was not always the conventional leader of
the group. Occasionally, a smaller, well-managed stock in the
group would assume leadership, perhaps with a new product, and
knock out the old leader.
Livermore observed that entire groups went in and out of favor
with each new major bull market. The leading stock groups of one
market most likely would not be the leading groups of the next
major market. And Livermore followed only the leading groups,
because he believed that if he could not make money with the

leading active issues and groups, then he would not make money
speculating in the market as a whole.
It was Livermore’s experience that stock group behavior was an
important key to overall market direction, a key ignored by most
traders, big or small. He believed that groups often provided the
key to predicting changes in trends. As favored groups got weaker
and collapsed, it usually meant a correction in the market as a
whole. This was how he called the market turns in 1907 and
1929—the leaders always rolled over first.
Livermore also used this same group-action technique in trad-
ing commodities.
Personally, things were going well for Livermore. In 1919,
Dorothy gave birth to a son, Jesse Jr. He and Dorothy talked things

over and decided it would be best to bring up their family outside
New York City. They went house hunting and eventually settled
on King’s Point in Great Neck, on Long Island.
The estate they bought, Locust Lawn, sat on 13 acres of beauti-
fully landscaped grounds and was bordered on one side by Long
Island Sound. It was more than a century old and had once been a
farmhouse. Dorothy enthusiastically took on the project of reno-
vating her new home.
Dorothy’s mother became her constant companion;she actually
had a suite of rooms designed for her mother in the renovated
mansion. Dorothy did nothing without first consulting her
mother. When they were finished with the designers, they simply
went to J.L., and he wrote them a check for whatever they wanted.
The estate was renovated and soon filled up with antique furniture,

beautiful art, exquisite silver, and tapestries. One tapestry, worth
over $25,000, was 60 feet long, and depicted Greek soldiers and
gods in full battle.
When Dorothy and her mother were finally finished some two
years later, the house contained 29 rooms and 12 bathrooms. In
the basement was a bar, a playroom, and a full barbershop. There
was a full-time live-in barber to shave Livermore and clip his hair
every day. J.L. and Dorothy each had massive walk-in closets and
huge bathrooms.
Livermore had more than 50 custom-made suits, along with
hundreds of ties and custom-made shirts. Livermore stood 5 foot
101⁄, but he had always wanted to be 6 feet tall, so he had 20 pairs
2
of custom-made elevator shoes that raised his height 11⁄ inches.

When Dorothy, or “Mousie,” as Livermore now called her, was
done with her remodeling, she placed a large brass plaque in one
of the front columns and renamed Locust Lawn “Evermore.”
The dining room table was shiny black walnut and sat 48 for
dinner. The kitchen would have been a proud fixture in most
hotels. The permanent staff of four worked at giant hooded stoves,
preparing food retrieved from the massive refrigeration units.
Dorothy loved dinner parties where she could shine and be
admired, and Livermore loved to participate in his quiet, power-
ful way.
She had as many parties as she could;any excuse, and she threw
a party. Even the powder room became a legend, with its huge,
perfect magnified mirrors circled by glowing stage-lamps, fronted
with tufted satin seats and damask-covered chaise lounges where
the women could relax and reapply their makeup while spreading
delicious gossip.
Livermore loved it all, and he loved the fact that he did not have
to do any of the planning or arrange any party details. That was
Dorothy’s job, and she loved it. Thanks to Dorothy, he made the
acquaintance of many people, including many beautiful women
and show-business people. Unfortunately for Mousie, he had a
passion for women in show business.
Livermore tried to limit the parties to the weekends when the
market was closed. During the week, when the market was open,
he followed a strict discipline, like an athlete in training. He went
to bed at 10 and was up in the morning no later than 6 for his quiet
time, his solitary strategy time. He ate breakfast alone in the nook
off the kitchen, where he could see the sprawling lawn that ran
down to Long Island Sound and his 300-foot yacht, with its crew
of 14, glimmering in the rising sun. He could also see the yachts
belonging to his neighbors, Alfred Sloan of General Motors and

Walter P. Chrysler, both equal in size to his own. He went to work
by himself in his chauffeured Rolls;or, in the summer, he took the
Chris-Craft from his pier to the yacht. Then he would take the
yacht into the city. It was about an hour’s cruise.
After they moved in, Dorothy learned that one of the servants
knew how to make beer, and she had a brewery built in the base-
ment. Prohibition was in full bloom. Eventually, Dorothy would
go around to the neighboring estates and deliver beer. She would
take the orders on Friday night and Saturday morning and deliver
the beer in her chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce convertible on Sat-
urday afternoon. Sometimes she would have Livermore’s Rolls
trail hers, also stacked with cases of beer for their friends. She had
the time of her life, laughing and gossiping with her friends, field-
ing calls from people like Walter Chrysler, Alfred Sloan, and Char-
lie Chaplin, as they placed their beer orders and chatted her up.
Chaplin would often drop by, play a game of billiards on the
imported English billiard table, and pick up his beer. Chaplin
played a good game of billiards, and so did Livermore. Chaplin
loved Dorothy’s humor, and would listen to her for hours trying to
figure out how she could be so naturally funny.
In the living room stood a Steinway grand piano. Livermore
loved opera and classical music, and he would often have famous
opera singers like Madam Shumann-Heink, renowned pianists and
composers, Broadway stars, and popular singers of the day sing and
play at parties.
Their existence was romantic and exciting. In 1923, just before
the house was completed, Dorothy delivered a second boy, Paul.
Livermore had been actively trading for 32 years by 1923. He was
46 years old, but he still had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge
about his chosen profession, and he was a constant student of
the technical side of the market as well as its psychology. He

concluded that there might be millions of minds at work in the
market, but there was basically only one psychological pattern that
had to be studied and understood. Human nature is fundamentally
the same.
Later in life, Livermore was asked an important question by his
sons, Paul and Jesse:“Dad, why are you good in the market and
other people lose all their money?”
“Boys, the stock market must be studied, not casually either, but
deeply, thoroughly. It’s my conclusion that most people pay more
care and attention to the purchase of an appliance for their house,
or when buying a car, than they do to the purchase of stocks. The
stock market, with its allure of easy money and fast action, induces
people into foolishness and the careless handling of their hard-
earned money, like no other entity.
“See, the purchase of a stock is simple, easily done by placing
your purchase order with a broker, and later a phone call to sell
completes the trade. If you profit from this transaction it appears to
be easy money with seemingly no work. You didn’t have to get to
work by nine and labor for eight hours a day. It was simply a paper
transaction, requiring no labor. It appears to be an easy way to get
rich. Simply buy the stock at ten dollars and sell it later for more
than ten dollars. The more you trade, the more you make, that’s
how it appears. That’s ignorance, and ignorance is dangerous.
“There’s also fear to deal with, which you will find out when
you grow up. Fear and violence lie buried just beneath the sur-
face of all normal human life. Fear, like violence, can appear in
a single heartbeat, a fast breath and the blink of an eye, the grab
of a hand, the noise of a gun. When it appears, natural survival
tactics come alive, normal reasoning is distorted. Reasonable
people act unreasonably when they are afraid. And people
become afraid when they start to lose money, their judgment
becomes impaired. This is our human nature in this stage of our

evolution. It cannot be denied. It must be understood, particu-
larly in trading the market.
“The unsuccessful investor is best friends with hope, and hope
skips along life’s path hand in hand with greed when it comes to
the stock market. Once a stock trade is entered, hope springs to life.
It is human nature to be positive, to hope for the best. Hope is an
important survival technique. But hope, like its stock market cousins
ignorance, greed, and fear, distorts reason. See, boys, the stock mar-
ket only deals in facts, in reality, in reason, and the stock market is
never wrong. Traders are wrong. Like the spinning of a roulette
wheel, the little black ball tells the final outcome, not greed, fear, or
hope. The result is objective and final, with no appeal.”
Both boys wondered if the stock market was for them. Was it
too dangerous? Should they just leave it to their father?
Livermore asked to be given no tips, and he, in turn, gave no tips.
He realized that, in many cases, tips were offered on a good-faith
basis by people who really did have the other person’s best interest
at heart. Tips could come from a relative, a loved one, or a friend
who had just made a serious investment and wanted to pass on
their good fortune. His motto was simple:All tips are dangerous.
They take all different forms. Take none of them.
There were tips that were purposely spread to provide false and
misleading information. These tips usually concealed an agenda
that might never be disclosed. Tips, Livermore knew after years of
trading, could come from any source. They could be disguised as
real and irrefutable information. A respected banker or an influen-
tial person interviewed by the press who had performed well in the
past might provide the tip. A well-known insider who had fully
disclosed a large position in the stock, or an executive with the
company, might provide the tip.

PERFECTING HIS MARKET THEORY • 143 •
And the tip very often made logical sense. An example: “Our
industry has taken a severe beating over the last two years and the
public reaction has been overdone. Our current prospects never
looked better. I have to say, based on objective valuation, we are
the biggest bargain in the stock market right now.”
There were tips spread by rumors about pending buyouts or
mergers. They were easily spread and passed along by the press,
often as scoops or exclusives.
There were also those who managed vast amounts of money
and honestly believed what they were saying and had put their
money where their mouths were. They had put up good hard cash
to back up their opinions, and they wanted the public to follow
suit. Like the old bucket-shop saying went, “The only way a stock
goes up is if some sucker buys it.”
Said Livermore to his son Paul:“I believe that the public wants
to be lead, to be instructed, to be told what to do. They want reas-
surance. They will always move en masse, a mob, a herd, a group,
because people want the safety of human company. They are afraid
to stand alone because they want to be safely included within the
herd, not to be the lone calf standing on the desolate, dangerous,
wolf-patrolled prairie of contrary opinion.
“This is where it gets slightly complicated because I always
wanted to trade along the line of least resistance, so I was generally
moving along with the crowd, the herd, most of the time. It was
when the change in trend started to appear, the change in market
direction, that was the most difficult change to catch and act upon.
So I was always hunting for the clues to the change. So I was
always ready to separate myself from the popular thinking, the
group thinking, and go the opposite way.
“It is the most difficult time in a speculator’s trading life. These
major changes in trends were hard to catch, but I did not want to

ride the sled downhill with the crowd, unless I had sold stocks
short.
“With this in mind, I developed two rules that I followed all the
time.
“First, do not be invested in the market all the time. There are
many times when I have been completely in cash, especially when
I was unsure of the direction of the market and waiting for a con-
firmation of the next move. Whenever I deduced that a change
was coming, and I wasn’t sure exactly when, or how severe the
change might be, I cashed in my positions and waited.
“Second, it is the change in the major trend that hurts most
speculators. They simply get caught invested in the wrong direc-
tion, on the wrong side of the market. To determine if I was right
in my appraisal, that a change in market trend was coming, I used
small position probes, placing small orders, either buy or sell,
depending on the direction of the trend change. I did this to test
the correctness of my judgment.
“There were other factors as well to mark the end of a major
market move. There was usually heavy volume, but the prices
stalled, they did not go up and make new highs on the leading
stocks. There was no strong continuation of the current move.
This was a clue, a warning. At the end of a market move it is usu-
ally pure distribution, as stocks go from strong hands to weak
hands, from the professionals to the public. It is deceptive to the
public who view this heavy volume as the mark of a vibrant,
healthy market going through a normal correction, not a top or a
bottom.
“I was always alert to look toward volume indications as a key
signal at the end of a major move, either in the entire market or an
individual stock. Also I observed that at the end of a long move, it
was not uncommon for stocks to suddenly spike up in a straight
shot with heavy volume and then stop, roll at the top, exhausted,

and then retreat, never to make a “new high” before the onslaught
of a major correction.*
“This last gasp of heavy volume also provides a great opportu-
nity to sell out any illiquid large holdings. I knew it was foolish to
ever try to catch the tops or the bottoms of the moves. It is always
better to sell large holdings into an advancing market when there
is plenty of volume. The same is true on the short side;you are best
to cover the short position after a steep fast decline.

is to determine the direction of the line of least resistance. Put the

wind at your back and sail forward easily. Keep the wind out of
your face, and when the market hits the doldrums getting
nowhere, moving sideways, then get out, take a break, have some
fun, go fishing.
“Come back into the market when the wind has picked up
again, and the sailing is clear and good. Staying out of the action is
always difficult for an active trader, but I grew to know it was
essential at times to be out of the market. There is nothing more
important than your emotional balance.”
On October 5, 1923, in order to practice his new techniques and
theories, Livermore moved his offices uptown, from 111 Broad-
way to 730 Fifth Avenue, the Heckscher Building. He designed
the offices very carefully. He wanted to be away from the Wall
Street atmosphere, out of earshot of any tips. He also wanted to
gain more secrecy in his operations and more security, so that no
one would know his trades.
He hired Harry Edgar Dache as his assistant, a hulking bruiser
whose sheer size belied his intelligence. Dache had been in the
merchant marines and had traveled the globe many times. He
spoke six languages, including Latin. He was a voracious reader,
knowledgeable in many areas, and a terrific administrator. He ran
the office with secrecy and perfection. He was completely loyal to
Livermore and very protective. The boys loved Dache;Jesse Jr. and
Paul were enthralled with his magical stories of traveling the seven
seas. He was their unofficial tutor, chauffeur, companion and
bodyguard, especially when they went to Palm Beach.
There were no windows in the anteroom of Livermore’s new
offices, only a few chairs and Dache’s desk. Behind Dache was the
solid floor-to-ceiling door to Livermore’s private offices. There
were no signs or identification on any of the doors. When letting
someone in to see Livermore, Dache would always first confirm

the appointment by intercom. Then he would rise from his desk
and use his key to open the door for the visitor. It was a theatrical
ritual that Dache performed to show the visitor the difficulty in
gaining entrance to the inner sanctum of the great trader’s offices.
Behind the door was the massive open room with the green
chalkboard that ran the entire length of the room. At least four
markers would be working in silence, each covering a section ofthe
board and responsible for specific active stocks or commodities that
Livermore was trading or observing closely. Each marker wore head-
phones that connected to callers on the floor ofthe exchange, who
would call up the quotes on each individual stock transaction—
the bid, asked, and sold price. This gave Livermore an edge on the
ticker tape, which was usually delayed at least 15 minutes. Livermore
wanted the most current information he could get. He had learned
as a young man how important fresh quotes were.
If Livermore was active in several stocks or commodities, he
would often increase his staff on the chalkboard from four to six.
These markers would work all day on the catwalk in silence, only
taking a break for lunch, when they would usually be replaced by
Dache, so no quotes were lost. These board markers would always
track two or more stocks in the same group. If Livermore was trad-
ing General Motors, he would track Chrysler as well, to observe
the group action.
In the middle of the office was a massive conference table of
shiny mahogany with eight comfortable leather office armchairs.
On the rare occasions when Livermore had guests to his office, he
would always sit facing the chalkboard so he could watch the
quotes as he listened. Often he would break off the meeting to
enter his office and place trades in private.
Livermore’s private office was very large, with heavy paneling of
oak and mahogany. His desk was large, made out of highly pol-
ished mahogany. On his desk were in- and out-baskets, a pad and

pencil, and nothing else. The entire wall across from the great
mahogany desk was clear plate glass, so he could see the market
action on the board as it happened.
There were also three black telephones on his desk. One was a
direct wire to London, the second to Paris, and the third to the
floor of the Chicago grain pits. Livermore wanted first-hand, fresh
information, and he was willing to pay for it. He knew that wars
were won on information—intelligence—and that the general
with the best intelligence was the general most likely to win. He
wanted no “rumors of war”—he wanted specific, accurate infor-
mation.
Paul Livermore, his son, would often come to this office as he
grew up, especially on his summer breaks. He would sometimes be
allowed to work the board. The board markers were trained to
work with a code. If a stock suddenly had a deep price fluctuation,
they would use a secret code to note this on the board. Only the
board crew and Livermore knew these codes. This was what Liv-
ermore later disclosed as his market key. On occasion, guests in the
office would ask, “J.L. what are those weird columns on the chalk-
board, some kind of hieroglyphics?”
“They make perfect sense to me,” Livermore would respond.
“You wanna explain them to me?”
“No,” he would smile. “If I did, then you would be as smart as
I am.”
“Just tell me what to buy and sell and when. Keep it simple for
me.”
“You know I never recommend a stock, but I would be glad to
tell you whether I believe the market is going up or down.”
“It always goes up or down, J.L.”
“You’re right, of course, but the trick is when it is going to go
up or down.”

“And what’sgoing to go up or down, J.L. Don’t forget, it’s what
stocks are going to go up or down—that’s what we all want to
know. What stock will rise, and when.”
“Anyone who knows the general trend of the market should be
able to do well.”
“Whatever you say, J.L. Whatever you say.”
One day Livermore was sitting in his office talking to his son
Paul. “Turn around Paul, and look at the stock board,” Livermore
ordered. Paul turned and studied the markers as they moved on the
catwalk like well-choreographed dancers.
Livermore continued, “You see, son, those markings on that
board are as clear to me as a musical score is to a great conductor.
I see these symbols as alive, a rhythm, a pulse that makes beautiful
music. It all makes perfect sense to me.
“You see, son, for me the board is alive, like music. We are able
to communicate. It’s something that has come to me only after
years of hard work and practice, not unlike a great conductor of a
great orchestra. What I feel when I look at that board can’t be
shared, any more than a conductor could articulate what he feels
when he plays Mozart just the way it should be played. The board
and those men are playing a symphony to me, a symphony of
money that sings to me, that makes love to me, that envelops me
in its song.”
Paul studied his father and he believed every word. It was a rare
moment for Paul, to get so intimate with his father, who was so
private, stingy with his emotions, frugal with his love.

LIVERMORE LOVED TO PLAY CARDS, ESPECIALLY BRIDGE.
He played a high-stakes game of bridge every Monday night at his
home in Great Neck. He would invite his neighbors, Walter
Chrysler and Alfred Sloan, and usually his good friend Harry
Aronhson, a silk merchant who lived in New York. Aronhson was
extremely rich, and he loved to watch Livermore and his raids.
Once in a great while he would participate in a raid, as well. He
would go to Livermore’s offices and sit in silence, just watching
the great trader at work.
One day Livermore got a call at his office from Ely Culbertson,
the world champion bridge player.
“Mr. Livermore, I understand you are quite a bridge player,”
Culbertson said.
“We play a friendly game once in a while. We’re not in your
class, Mr. Culbertson.”
“Please call me Ely.”
“Well then, call me J.L.”
“I had a favor to ask you. I have been told you are very skilled
with numbers, and I wondered if you could figure out some prob-
abilities for me. You know, the probabilities for certain finesses to
work and certain point counts, the probabilities of making a game
with certain card point counts, things like that.”
“Well, Ely, give me the problems, and I’ll see what I can do.”
Culbertson spent the next 30 minutes outlining his questions to
Livermore, who took specific notes. One week later, he called
Culbertson back and read off his answers. Culbertson was
impressed. Livermore invited him to join their game on Monday
nights.
“I’m afraid your games are too rich for me, J.L.”
There was a silence. “Look, don’t worry about the money,
whoever has you for a partner will cover the bet for your team,
you can keep the money if your team wins. We just would all

enjoy playing with you. I called the boys, and they agree it would
be good for us to play with the world’s best bridge player. Don’t
worry about the money. Are you in?”
“How can I lose?”
“Okay. I’ll switch you over to Harry Edgar Dache, my office
manager. He will get the necessary information from you so we
can send a car to pick you up. You’re welcome to stay overnight;
we have plenty of bedrooms. The game never goes much beyond
ten o’clock during the week. We start at six and have sandwiches
at eight.”
“All right then, I’ll see you on Monday night.”
They incorporated Culbertson into their game by setting up a
handicap; whoever had Culbertson as a partner got penalized
1,000 points. But they were all such good players that they soon
eliminated the handicap and played even. It was more of a chal-
lenge. Livermore and his friends could not have been more excited
to sit and play with, and sometimes against, the world’s best bridge
player.
ItwasbecauseLivermoreandhisfriendsalllovedtoplaycards—
poker, gin, and bridge—that Dorothy got her “yacht pool” idea.
One Monday night, she walked in early with the butler, who was
carrying the sandwiches, and interrupted the game. “Fellas, I have
an idea for you to think about. You know your wives and I, we
love to play cards too. So I thought maybe you would consider a

“And what’s in it for you, Mousie?” Livermore asked.
“Well, then we girls could go play on the other boats, or even
go for a cruise.”

The men broke out laughing, and the next morning the only
yacht pool in America was formed.
By the mid-1920s, it was well known on Wall Street that Liver-
more was one of the most skillful market traders. The press often
exaggerated his reputation, and it was enhanced by the mysterious
and secretive way that Livermore traded. He sometimes used up to
50 brokers to hide his trading activities;no one could easily get to
him. To the press, he was the mystery man of Wall Street, silent
and secretive.
At this time in history, from the turn of the century to the late
1920s, it was common to form pools on various stocks. These
pools were made up of investors and insiders who would pool
their stock in a particular issue. This was done to control the wild
fluctuations that might occur if big blocks were suddenly offered
for sale in a stock with thin volume. At least, that was the theory
offered by the promoters: Pooling created an orderly market. In
fact, most ofthe time they were just interested in distributing stock
to the public as expeditiously and at the best price as possible.
When individuals inside the pool wanted to get rid of their
equity holdings, they often went to a trading pro, like Livermore,
to sell their stock. This was usually done by the trading pro for a
fee. Livermore preferred to get a series of callson the stock, so that
he could buy the stock at preset prices. As the stock price rose on
the exchange, he had a chance to buy down the stock, exercise the
calls, and cash in. He often used his own money to set the market
up for the distribution of the pool stock. That way he did not have
to explain his actions to anyone.
Market manipulation was commonplace in the stock market at
the turn of the century, and there were no strong regulations to
prohibit this kind of trading. It was not considered illegal as long as
no false or misleading statements were issued. But it was illegal to

have wash sales, in which stock would be bought and sold only by
the insiders in the pool. This would churn the stock into life, and
simply drive the stock price up as it passed back and forth through
the same pairs of hands.
Livermore had seen a lot of manipulation and just about every
trick in the book when it came to rigging a stock’s action. Liver-
more was therefore always an obvious choice to run a pool. He
was approached on a regular basis. If he believed that it was a good
situation, he would become the pool trader.
He would first evaluate the company to make sure that it had
promise and could legitimately support a rise in the stock price.
Second, he had to be sure there was no possibility of bankruptcy
or sustained losses in earnings. He would then apply his basic trad-
ing rules, pretesting the stock’s action, before he said yes. The
overall stock market’s line of least resistance would also have to be
basically positive. Livermore believed that no degree of manipula-
tion could take a stock higher in a bear market climate.
Livermore was always very wary ofhis partners in any pool oper-
ation. They would often try to manipulate the manipulator. He
used the ticker tape to broadcast his activities on any pool operation
that he ran. He knew that there were thousands of tape-readers like
him who would pick up, almost immediately, when a stock started
to operate outside of its normal pattern, with increased volume and
a sharp spike upward in price. He knew this would spark the inter-
est ofother traders and immediately bring in new players with buy-
ing power. This was commonly called painting the tape.
Livermore also knew that this increase in action would
inevitably bring in short sellers, players who bet on the negative
side of the market, figuring it was only a pool play. These short-
sellers could later be squeezed by driving the price higher. They
would then have to buy in and cover their short positions. This
would also drive the price higher.

• 156 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
Livermore’s strategy was to build a strong base for the stock on
the way up, setting the stage to unload a huge amount of pool
stock onto the market. He had studied other great pool operators
such as James R. Keene, Jay Gould, and Commodore Vanderbilt.
Their strategy was simple: Manipulate the stock to the highest
point possible, and then sell the pool’s stock at the top and on the
way down, while the market was churning.
Livermore knew the psychology:When the stock came alive, so
would the greed of other speculators and investors. He particularly
liked sleepy stocks that he could wake up, but he never violated his
basic trading rule of first determining the line of least resistance.
Otherwise it was impossible, Livermore believed, to drive a stock
up, no matter how strong the pool was.
“The tape is the best means of getting tips spread,” Livermore
told his friends. It worked well for him. Often his partners were
more worrisome to him than was the stock manipulation.
Unlike his regular trading techniques for his own account,
when he would sell into a rising market, when Livermore ran a
pool, he sold out the bulk of the pool’s stock at the top and into a
falling market.
If the stock plummeted in price too fast, he would stop selling,
and perhaps even buy a little stock for support until the public
came back in. He knew the psychology of average traders, who
often wished they had sold at the top, and as a result he would wait
and not sell four or five points off the crested high. He would hold
his stock position, and wait for the powerful rally that he believed
was inevitable. He would sit and wait for a rally that might drive
the stock back up to the old high.
Also, Livermore knew that people like a bargain. It is their
nature to try to buy stock when it is cheap and sell it when it is
expensive. People often think a stock is cheap because the price is
lower than it was a few days before, when in fact it may decline

even further. Livermore knew that the wise trader waited until a
bottom had been firmly established and tested before going in and
buying stock.
The public was more inclined to believe that whatever had been
happening would continue to happen, and the pools depended on
this. A stock that had suddenly come alive and started to rise in
price would continue to rise in price. This was usually backed up
by carefully manufactured rumors that were released on a planned
basis by the insiders.
Livermore knew that selling on the way down was a time-
honored way of achieving distribution. Wake up a sleepy stock, let
the tape tell speculators and investors that the stock was now alive,
let the tape provide the tips. Most of all, sell on the way down, not
on the way up. This was the key to manipulating a stock and achiev-
ing distribution of large quantities by the big pool operators—and
it has remained the key ever since, because human nature never
changes.
This is one of the reasons why both experienced and inexperi-
enced stock speculators are subject to manipulation and often get
fooled. They believe the insiders are feeding out their stock on the
meteoric upward rise of a stock. They are often wrong. The pub-
lic is usually being fed the majority of the insider or pooled stock
after the stock has crested by reaching new highs and is rolling
over, starting its decline. This is often the reason why a stock can-
not make a new high—there is simply too much supply hanging
over the market. It is often insider or informed distribution that
makes it impossible for a stock to rise in price.
Livermore was well aware of this in his personal trading. It was
one of the reasons that new highs were so important to him. A
true new high meant that the stock had broken through the over-
head supply of stock—now it was being accumulated again, and,
most important, the line of least resistance was strongly upward.

He was basically alone in this thinking in the 1920s. When the
majority ofpeople saw that a stock had made a new high, they sold
it immediately and looked for a cheaper stock.
Livermore had long ago realized that the stock market was never
obvious. It was designed to fool most ofthe people most ofthe time.
His rules were based on thinking against the grain: cut your
losses quick; let your profits ride unless there’s a good reason to
close out the position;the action is with the leading stocks, which
change with every new market; new highs are to be bought on
breakouts;cheap stocks are often not bargains, because they have
little potential to rise in price. The stock market is a study in
cycles. It never goes up forever, nor does it go down forever, but
when it changes direction it remains in that new trend until it is
stopped. Livermore didn’t buck the trend.
In June 1922, the New York Stock Exchange listed the Piggly
Wiggly grocery stores for trading. The builder and owner of this
chain of retail stores was Clarence Saunders, a corpulent 40-year-
old from Memphis, Tennessee. The shares were issued and the
stock promptly tanked, falling drastically in price.
Saunders, upset with the stock price, rounded up $10 million in
cash and came to Wall Street to get the price of his stock up. He
went directly to Livermore. Their partnership created the last cor-
ner in the history of Wall Street.
“Mr. Livermore, I want to get the price of my stock up. I have
a war chest of ten million for you to use to do it. Will you?”
“It’s selling at $35 right now. Is it worth more?”
“Yes. It came out at $50, and that was an undervalued price.”
“How many shares are there in the market?” Livermore asked.
“Two hundred thousand float. I got the rest!”
“When do you want to start?”

“What’s wrong with tomorrow?”
“Give me a few days, Mr. Saunders, to check things out.”
“Okay. You haven’t told me what it will cost me for your serv-
ices.”
“Normally, I don’t take a fee;I just take a schedule of calls on
the stock. But this is a unique situation, so we can decide on a fair
fee for my services later.”
Livermore checked out the market and they met a few days
later.
“Okay, Mr. Saunders, I think we can work out a deal. I want
twenty percent of the increase in value of the stock.”
“That’s fair enough. Can you start right away?”
“I’ll start tomorrow.”
The next day, using Saunders’ $10-million war chest, Livermore
quietly started to buy the stock in the open market. By the end of
the first week, he had bought 105,000 shares out of the total float
of 200,000. He went back to Saunders.
“Mr. Saunders, I have been able to buy over half the float, and
the price hasn’t budged. It’s still $35.”
“What in tarnation does that mean?”
“It means that there is not a lot of interest in your stock.”
“Blast it! There will be! Use that money I gave you. That’s what
it’s for. That stock is worth a whole lot more than $35. So stick it
to ’em!”
Livermore went back into the market, and by March 1923 he
had pumped the price up to $70. He was now faced with what
would be one of the most important decisions of his entire career.
The Street had triggered to the fact that Piggly Wiggly was being
cornered. But most traders thought it was a pool at work, headed
by the inexperienced owner, Saunders, trying to get rid of his
stock. As a result, these seasoned traders started to short the stock,

borrowing the stock now to be replaced when they actually
bought the stock back later.
Livermore saw the problem by the time he had accumulated
198,000 shares for Saunders out of a float of 200,000 shares. The
problem was that his friends on the Street were in a terribly
vulnerable position. They could be ruined. He was called to see
Saunders.
“Livermore, you did a heck of a job. You got the price of the
stock to over $70, and there is no stock left for anyone to buy. I
want you to call for delivery of all the stock that has been bor-
rowed to cover the stock that has been sold short.”
“That will drive the price of the stock up to . . .”
“Whatever we want it to be!”Saunders laughed. “Until I decide
to sell those smug bastards back a little of my stock.”
“I won’t do it. It is not a wise thing to do.”
“What are you talking about? You won’t do it? We made a deal!”
“Too many of my friends will be ruined. I didn’t make a deal to
destroy my friends.”
“Are you crazy, Livermore? How could they be your friends if
they went short a stock you were running?”
“It’s part of the game, Mr. Saunders. It all balances out.”
“Maybe it’s part ofyourgame. But it ain’t part ofmygame. They
ignored my stock and now they’re gonna pay for it.” He studied
Livermore, who remained impassive. “And Livermore—what do
you mean by it isn’t a wise thing to do, drive the price up?”
“It will drive the stock up in a sudden spike. The other traders
will know it’s a short squeeze, and there isn’t any real demand for
your stock, so they will lay off the issue, and ultimately it will fall
like a stone.”
“Bunkum! You’re just talking for your friends now, because I
got ’em by the balls and I intend to squeeze. They didn’t show me
no mercy, and this is my only play on Wall Street. I’m not some

big-shot trader like you who has hundreds of plays to choose from.
Besides, you’re getting twenty percent of the value of the stock
over $35. We can drive the stock up to over $100. That’s another
fortune for you.”
“Keep it! I’m out, if you demand delivery of the stock certifi-
cates.”
“You never heard of what old Daniel Drew said about people
who sell short? ‘He that sells what isn’t his’n, must buy it back or
go to pris’n.’”
“Yes, I’ve heard that before Mr. Saunders, and I’ve also heard
‘Don’t do unto others what you would not like them to do to
you.’ I’m going to be making my living here for a long, long time
to come.”
“Well, if that’s your last word, then good luck to you. Thanks
for the help, sorry you didn’t make any money for your trouble.”
“There will be other deals. Goodbye, Mr. Saunders.” Liver-
more walked out.
The next day, Saunders did exactly what he said he was going to
do. He demanded delivery of all stock that was on loan to cover
the short positions. In hours, the stock spiked from $70 to $124.
But a mysterious rumor had started on the Street, from an
unknown source, that Saunders had cornered the stock. This was
against the new stock exchange rules. The rumor reached the board
of governors, which stepped in that afternoon and suspended trad-
ing in Piggly Wiggly. The stock fell like a stone to 82 as the rumor
was proven true. Livermore’s friends were home free and safe.
Saunders later went bust. But he never stopped talking about
how he had held stock market victory in his hands, only to be
screwed royally by that swindler Livermore and his bastard friends.
Livermore was always a mystery to the press. He would never con-
firm or specifically deny the rumors that followed his trades. He

was supposed to have lost $8.5 million in Mexican Petroleum
(“Mexican Pete”) by being on the short side of a runaway bull
market in the stock. The stock advanced a nonstop 75 points and
reportedly caught a lot of investors on the wrong side of the mar-
ket. Livermore was rumored to be included.
“Gentlemen, gentlemen, I will neither confirm nor deny the
things you have asked me about Mexican Pete,”he said to the New
York Times on June 29, 1922.
“Why is that sir?” one reporter asked.
“Because I don’t want to spoil a good joke.”
“Go ahead and spoil it, Mr. Livermore, tell us what happened.
We heard you lost eight and a half million dollars for yourself and
your friends and you made a private settlement to get out of the
trap you found yourself in.”
“No, I’m having too much fun to spoil this joke. I’m enjoying
myself too much to bother you with the facts.” Livermore smiled.
“Look fellas, you printed that the stock got away from me on the
upside on the day that I was attending Lillian Russell’s memorial
services at the Hippodrome. I did not attend those services, and on
that day I left the office at five o’clock. I have witnesses to prove it,
which I had already told you yesterday, but you printed what you
wanted anyway.”
“Just tell us about Mexican Pete and the beating you took, Mr.
Livermore,” the Times reporter said.
“You printed that I made a settlement with the Mexican Pete
group to cover my shorts at $225 a share. You were told this by a
certain stock exchange house. At that very time, four in the after-
noon, when I was supposed to be making that settlement with my
lawyer, with my friend Mr. E. L. Doheny present, I was actually up
in Poughkeepsie watching the boat races. I have witnesses to con-
firm that also.”
“So you’re denying this then?” a reporter yelled.

“What I have told you is enough to give anyone sane an oppor-
tunity to draw their own conclusions as to whether I was the one
caught short of Mexican Petroleum. But I have to say this, in addi-
tion, if I did happen to be the one caught short of Mexican Petro-
leum, I would have taken my licking in the market and bought
back the stock to cover my position, no matter what the price was.
Gentlemen, I have never made a private settlement in my life, nor
will I.”
“What about the story published yesterday that you got caught
short with one hundred thousand shares, Mr. Livermore?”
“The reporter who wrote that story must have been inexperi-
enced in the ways of Wall Street. At least he should have given me
the sense not to go short almost the entire floating supply of Mex-
ican Petroleum shares. Ifthat reporter had really known how much
stock of Mexican Pete I purchased on the afternoon I was sup-
posed to be at the Hippodrome, such ridiculous stories would not
gain circulation.”
All through the 1920s, stories like this appeared in the press. Liv-
ermore helped sell a lot of newspapers, even though he tried to
avoid publicity. It only made the press more insatiable to know
about him.
One story that was never disclosed by the press shocked his son
Paul. He had asked his father to tell him a story that no one else
knew.
“All right, son. After the Great War ended in 1918, before you
were born, I felt that cotton would fall in price on a short-term
basis because the military demand would cease to exist. But I also
thought the demand would pick up again later as the nation got
back on its feet.
“So in 1919—quietly, in secret, using hundreds of brokers—I
started buying cotton. The price fell as I had expected, and over

about an eighteen-month period I realized that I had almost secured
a full corner on cotton. I had bought almost every single bale of
cotton. This fact did not escape the eyes of the U.S. government.
“As soon as I had my full position I got a call from the secretary
of agriculture to immediately come to Washington and meet with
President Wilson. I took the train to Washington and went straight
to the White House, where the secretary and the president were
waiting. I was ushered in directly to see the president.
“After greetings were exchanged, President Wilson began. ‘Mr.
Livermore, it has come to our attention that you have cornered the
Chicago cotton futures market. Is that true?’
“‘Yes, Mr. President,’ I said.
“‘Now we know what a smart fellow you are, and the price of
cotton is nice and low now, and you have properly figured out that
the projections for cotton demand in the next little while is high as
the nation comes back from war and prosperity begins in earnest.’
“‘Yes, Mr. President,’ I said.
“‘We know you understand about inflation, Mr. Livermore, and
with you having a corner on cotton you can pretty much name
your price as the demand grows,’ the secretary of agriculture said.
“‘And we don’t want inflation Mr. Livermore. Higher prices in
something as important as the cotton market will be very bad
while the nation is trying to get on its feet, don’t you think?’ the
president added.
“‘Yes sir,’ I said.
“‘Let me ask you a question, Mr. Livermore, a question that has
my full interest.’
“‘Yes sir,’ I said, and waited.
“‘Why? Why did you corner the cotton market?’
“‘To see if I could, Mr. President.’
“‘You cornered the entire United States cotton market, to see
if you could, Mr. Livermore?’ the secretary of agriculture blurted.

“‘Yes sir. It got out of hand a little at first, and then I wanted to
see if I could do it, that’s all.’
“‘Well, Mr. Livermore, what would it take for you to undo it,
before the other traders really find out what’s happened here and
start to drive up the price?’ the president asked.
“‘Nothing sir, just you asking me here today, that will do it.’
“‘How, how will you do it?’ the secretary asked.
“‘I’ll sell it just like I bought it, in an orderly way, and I will sell
only for what I basically paid for it. I’m not interested in anything
that will hurt the country.’
“We shook hands and I lived up to my promise. But I always
have to smile when I think of this story. Nobody except the secre-
tary of agriculture and the president and myself ever knew about
what had happened.
“And now you too, son.”
It was in the 1920s that Livermore acquired his gun collection.
Firearms had always fascinated him. He built a shooting range at
Evermore after the house had been finished. The shooting range
was down on the beach level. He excavated a long corridor,
beginning at the ledge where the beach ended and the rolling
lawns began. About 6 feet high, it ran 100 feet and divided into a
Y. The sides were supported with timbers, and at the end of the
shooting alley was a wall of heavy wood, then sand, then a 1-inch-
thick steel sheet to stop the bullets.
He had a large collection of handguns, shotguns, and rifles, and
he spent lots of time with Dorothy and the boys, teaching them
about firearms. Paul, an expert marksman, could fieldstrip a .45
automatic and reassemble it in minutes when he was 11 years old.
Jesse Jr. and Mousie were also crack shots.
Livermore kept his handguns locked up in the library, along
with his extensive collection of high-powered rifles and shotguns.

Livermore often hunted in the woods surrounding his home in
Lake Placid. He also had a large collection of classic Purdy shot-
guns, made for him in England, for bird shooting.
Livermore also built a skeet range that fired clay pigeons off into
Long Island Sound. He often shot skeet for $5 a bird, sometimes
shooting from the hip, blasting the clay pigeons into smithereens.
Dorothy was also a great shot, especially with a rifle. She could
give anyone a run for their money on the shooting range. She had
no fear of guns.
One day the boys went into the library and the downstairs gun-
room and counted the guns:There were 405 guns of one kind or
another in the house. Livermore told his boys the shooting range
helped him relax.
Livermore had constant stress to deal with in the markets.
Livermore had direct wires from his offices to more than 50 bro-
kerage firms. In 1923, he ran a pool that he later regretted—
Mammoth Oil, which was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal.
Two close associates, E. L. Doheny and Harry F. Sinclair, came to
Livermore in October 1922. They wanted to distribute 151,000
shares of stock to the public at $40 a share. They wanted Liver-
more to engineer the distribution and at the same time try to run
an orderly market in the stock.
Mammoth was a Sinclair Oil subsidiary that had received prof-
itable oil leases from the U.S. Navy—through, as it was later dis-
closed, the direct help of Albert Fall, the secretary of the interior.
The Mammoth issue was immediately oversubscribed once the
public heard that Livermore was running the stock. The first day,
sales opened with 8,000 shares at $43 a share;the day ended with
total sales of 40,000 shares, with a closing price of $40.75. The sale
of stock went well, and the 151,000 shares were sold to the public
within three days.

But on February 16, 1924, the Teapot Dome scandal broke. The
scandal rocked the market. The price of Mammoth Oil fell like a
stone. Livermore was in Palm Beach at the Breakers when the
news hit. He had been there since December 28, 1923. Traveling
with him was his private telegraph operator.
He had traveled to Palm Beach in his own private railway car.
The car was opulent, with three bedrooms, a galley, and a large liv-
ing and dining area. The boys each had their own nannies, who
traveled in the train’s regular sleeper cars, as did the chef and the
butler. Livermore always kept the car at the ready in the New York
train yards. When he was in Palm Beach, the railway car was kept
in the Miami train yards. He also used it when he traveled to his
home in Lake Placid, or when he went to Chicago to visit the
grain pits during heavy speculation.
The Teapot Dome scandal involved two cabinet members:Sec-
retary Fall of the Interior Department and Secretary Denby of the
Navy. It was an elaborate scam. Naval oil properties had been
transferred to the Interior Department;naval coal lands in Alaska
were to be transferred in the same way. After a suitable passage of
time, the Interior Department, headed by Secretary Fall, would
then lease them under very favorable conditions to private enter-
prises, including Mammoth Oil.
President Coolidge’s entire administration was placed in jeop-
ardy. Correspondence and other documentation clearly proved the
fraud charges. Mammoth plunged on the news, and then the
entire market followed.
Livermore had already sold out his Mammoth Oil and was a
bear at the time of the scandal. He had shorted a number of other
stocks. But he was named as a fringe player in the scandal and was
placed under federal court subpoena.
On February 16, 1924, the New York Times eagerly covered the
story:

Every day that passes brings out some new sensational devel-
opment in regard to the oil hearing;this has undermined the
confidence of a lot of people in the stock market. If this
investigation fever of Senators and Congressmen keeps up
and branches out into investigation of other matters, it is
going to disturb confidence in a great deal more. I think it is
very foolish trying to be an optimist on the stock market at
the present time.
The Times went on the next day to report:
The speculatively inclined accepted the message of Jesse Liv-
ermore’s as gospel yesterday and at once turned into bears.
The decline was under full-speed at noon and every class of
shares was affected.
The scandal had erupted. Livermore remained in Palm Beach
and eluded the subpoena for a while, but was eventually called
before a congressional committee. He gave his testimony and was
not bothered again. It was not as easy for Doheney and Sinclair,
who were both indicted for bribery. Sinclair was ultimately sen-
tenced to nine months in prison, while Doheny was acquitted of
all charges. Fall was convicted of bribery. He was the first U.S. cab-
inet member ever to go to jail.
Livermore’s final comment to the press on the matter was:
In the future, men of higher caliber should be sent to Wash-
ington. This country is a business nation, and it should have
at the head of its various governmental branches the most
successful businessmen in the country.
Livermore was later accused of trying to manipulate the press in
order to affect the steep downward decline of the market during

the scandal. His response was published in the March 8, 1924, edi-
tion of the New York Times:
Mr. Jesse Livermore has offered a reward of $25,000 for proof
that he had sent or contemplated any of the messages referred
to in the various rumors about him trying to affect the market.
More rumors started flying, and Livermore sent a wire to the
press from the Breakers in Palm Beach:
I emphatically deny the rumor which was so industriously
spread throughout the country that I was to issue a statement
of some kind this afternoon. I have sent no messages or wires
nor have I made any private statement to anyone; therefore
the rumor that was started yesterday, was started by some
unscrupulous person or persons. Three weeks ago, on Febru-
ary 14, I received requests from two brokers and one promi-
nent capitalist asking me my personal opinion on the
immediate future of the stock market. I sent them a short and
concise statement of my views and stated at that time it was a
confidential message meant only for them personally.
Someone, without my permission, gave the message out,
and it was sent broadcast over a number of private wires, and
later carried by the newspapers. Having had the confidence
of a personal and private message betrayed, there will be no
more personal messages sent or given by me to anyone.
Livermore was becoming an expert in handling the press and using
it to his benefit. His mysterious and secretive ways on Wall Street
only increased allure, mystery, and fascination, fueling the fires of
public curiosity and selling more newspapers.
The last issue he ran was the initial public offering of the

De Forest Radio Company. The issue, 75,000 shares, was offered on
November 8, 1924, at $21 a share. The offering was tremendously
oversubscribed and later was listed on the New York Curb Market.
In 1924, Wall Street was on fire with the introduction of com-
mercial radio, and the De Forest issue was timed perfectly to coin-
cide with the overheated demand for any high-technology radio
stock.
The issue later went bankrupt.
In the meantime, Livermore was enjoying himself at his beloved
Palm Beach. His yacht was moored there, and he was ready for
some big game fishing.
In January 1925, he took his boat and six guests down to the
Florida Keys. In the Keys, Livermore hooked into a big shark. He
fought the fish, strapped in the fighting chair, for 55 minutes. The
rod suddenly went wild as he released his grip and fainted in the
chair. The captain and crew carried him to his stateroom.
He was confined to his stateroom for three days, recovering. But
it did not upset the fishing. The total catch was reported as 256
fish, along with a giant stingray, which was harpooned in the Gulf
Stream. The stingray towed the boat for five miles before it was
brought alongside. It weighed 590 pounds and had a spread of 22
feet. It measured 30 feet from the head to the end of the stinger.
But life wasn’t all fun. There was always a threat in the air for
those who were famous for their enormous wealth. On March 15,
1925, Mrs. Louis Goldstein, wife of an assistant district attorney
for Kings County, was sitting on the porch of the Breakers Hotel
dozing. It was raining heavily. She was awakened by the raised
voices of two men in a heated discussion.
“What would a million dollars be to him?” one of the men
asked. “Why, he makes that much in a single speculation on the
stock market.”

“We could take the older boy, Jesse Junior, for instance. He’s a
high-spirited youngster and runs around all the time by himself. It
would be the easiest thing in the world to grab ahold of him.”
Mrs. Goldstein, now fully awake, got up from her seat. She
knew Livermore, and she knew these men were referring to him
and his son. She walked over to the two men on the porch so she
could have a good look at their faces. The two men looked up at
her and then looked away, pulling up their collars and pulling
down their hats. They rose from their chairs and hurriedly walked
off the porch into the pouring rain.
Mrs. Goldstein immediately reported the conversation to Liver-
more and he, at once, sent a wire to New York to have a detective
sent to Palm Beach to stay with the boys for the rest of the season.
But the detective never got to Palm Beach.
On March 18, Dache and the boys were returning from a car
trip to the Everglades in the Rolls. Dache was driving, and the
boys were sitting up front with him. He saw the smoke first as they
approached the Breakers. Huge dark clouds of smoke were
enveloping the far end of the hotel. Dache parked the car and
walked to the expansive front lawn to watch the fire with the boys.
Dorothy was in the crowd and ran to the boys. “Oh, thank God
you were out in the car with Harry.”
“But our end of the hotel isn’t even burning yet,” Jesse Jr. said.
“It will,” Dache said.
Just then Livermore arrived. He had been down on the yacht
with the crew getting ready for a cruise to the Florida Keys.
“What happened?” he asked.
“This place was a firetrap at best, J.L., old dried-out wood bak-
ing in the tropics. An accident waiting to happen.”
“J.L., I hope our luggage will be all right. I had it packed for the
cruise.”

“We can always buy more luggage, Mousie,” he said.
“But our initials are on all the pieces, and they all match so
nice.” They each had 12 pieces of Luis Vuitton hand-crafted
monogrammed luggage. “I asked the bell captain to try!” Dorothy
continued.
“Try what?” Livermore asked.
“To go back and try to save them,” Dorothy answered.
“J.L., look at that.” Dache pointed to the corner where they
had their suite of rooms. “Look up at those windows, I can’t
believe it.”
Luggage was showering out through the fourth-floor window.
When it landed on the lawn, it was picked up by a crew of bell-
hops who carried it away from the fire toward the beach.
“Mousie, I think that’s our luggage. I’m dumbfounded,” Liver-
more said. “Mousie, you stay with the boys while Harry and I go
see if we can help.” The two men ran toward that corner of the
building. They got there as the bellhops were stacking up the last
of the 24 pieces on the beach.
Dache got there first and inspected the luggage. “This is incred-
ible, this luggage falls four stories, bounces on the grass, gets
kicked and piled up in the sand, and there isn’t a mark on it.”
Livermore examined the luggage. “You’re right, Harry. It’s
amazing that Mousie would ask them to go back into the fire, and
that they would actually do it, and it’s amazing that the luggage
survived.”
“Without a scratch or a dent. You ought to buy this Louis Vuit-
ton stock.”
Livermore smiled. “I think I might buy it, Harry, but there’s
one problem.”
“What’s that, J.L.?”
“The stuff never wears out. Or breaks. No repeat sales!”

They laughed and gave Dorothy the high sign that everything
was fine.
The Breakers was rebuilt in record time, just one year. Schultz
and Weaver, the same firm that had designed the Waldorf Astoria
in New York and the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, designed
the new and improved Breakers Hotel. By 1927, many people
considered this new Breakers to be the finest resort in the United
States. The Livermores agreed, and rented a suite of rooms well in
advance of the new hotel’s opening.
It was an active spring for Livermore. On April 9, 1925, he was
injured at his mansion in King’s Point. He was inspecting a newly
constructed wing of the mansion when he walked into a dimly lit
staircase and fell 20 feet. He was placed in his limousine and sped
to his house at 8 West Seventy-sixth Street in Manhattan.
Physicians were summoned to the house, where they diagnosed
him as having a broken right arm and some broken ribs. This diag-
nosis was confirmed by X ray, and he was confined to his home.
Livermore did not trade in stocks again until August 25, 1925.
He conducted business from his Lake Placid home. Rumors circu-
lated that he was long 50,000 shares of U.S. Steel and held an
important position in White Motors. Livermore refused to con-
firm these rumors.
On October 27, 1927, Livermore bought a new apartment in
New York at 825 Fifth Avenue, between Sixty-third and Sixty-
fourth Streets. This would become his New York residence.
Dorothy was thrilled with the new apartment, and along with her
mother, as always, she spent great time, effort, and money in dec-
orating their new home.

ON SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1927, ARTHUR BARRY; JAMES F.
Monaghan, known as “Boston Billy”;Eddie Kane, former chauf-
feur for Livermore; and Anna Blake, an attractive young woman
with bobbed blonde hair who was Barry’s girlfriend, sat around a
midnight campfire at Evermore, the Livermore estate. The full de-
tails of the dramatic events that followed during the next several
hours were subsequently covered by both the New York Times and
the Daily News from May 31, 1927, until December 27, 1929.
The men were settled on their haunches in a patch of open land
under a big oak tree. Blake sat on the grass. They could see the shim-
mering, moonlit water in front of them and the long pier where the
Chris-Craft was tied up. The Livermore yacht sat anchored in deep
water, about 100 yards off the pier. To their left, they could see the
massive house through the forest. They were waiting for the lights to
go out. They knew there was a dinner party going on. They even
knew who the guests were: millionaire silk merchant Harry
Aronhson and his wife, close friends of the Livermores, who had
come from New York on the yacht for the weekend. Kane, Liver-
more’s former chauffeur, had informed Monaghan about the small
dinner party and the layout of the Livermore mansion.
Barry and Monaghan were dressed in dark gray business suits,
shirts, ties, and fedora hats. They were clean-shaven and about 25
years old. Livermore was later to comment that they looked more
like Wall Street clerks than burglars. Barry was muscular and
brawny;Monaghan was of average size and weight, about 5 foot 10
and 160 pounds, but he was the fiercer of the two.
They sat around the campfire roasting hot dogs. They had even
brought a little picnic bag with buns and drinks in it. They chatted
calmly as they waited for the clock to reach 3:30 A.M.
“So, the safe may have up to a million in jewelry?” Barry asked.
“Yeah, that’s right. This guy Livermore is crazy about his wife
and has given her millions in jewels,” Kane said. “They’re all from

Harry Winston and Van Cleef and Arpels, first quality, easy to take
outta the settings.”
“Easy to fence,”Monaghan said, biting into his hot dog, sipping
from a bottle of beer.
Kane continued, “Word is that Livermore has such a fear of
going broke, because he’s been broke before, that he gave his old
lady the jewelry so’s if he busted out again he could take the jewel
stash back and hock it for at least a cool million. The jewels are his
stake to start over. Rumor is that he has actually done it, hocked
’em, on occasion with that big-shot jeweler Harry Winston who
made ’em in the first place.”
“High-class hock shop. Buy the jewels for your wife, then hock
’em back to the jeweler. Pretty nifty, these rich folks, but they’re
just like everybody else when they get in trouble. They take back
their gifts and hock ’em,” Blake said.
“You know from experience, huh, Anna?” Monaghan said.
“Shut your face, Billy,” Barry said. “How do you know all this,
Eddie?”
“Hey, the house slaves get to know everything about their mas-
ters. Don’t you know that?”
“Yeah, I heard of that,” Monaghan said. “This ain’t my first
job.”
The gang had stolen an expensive canary-yellow Chrysler road-
ster from the garage of Walter Roesler, one of Livermore’s neigh-
bors. Roesler himself had borrowed the car for the day from his
friend George Owens. It was a high-profile, well-known car in
Great Neck. They had hidden it off the road near the entrance to
the Livermore estate.
They watched over their campfire as all the lights went out in
the mansion. Hours later, at 3:45 in the dark morning, they
watched the embers of their campfire sizzle and die as they poured
the last of the beer on it. Barry and Monaghan stood, straightened

their ties, adjusted their fedoras, and headed for the mansion. Kane
and Blake also stood.
Monaghan picked up his ladder, which was leaning against a
tree. It was about 4 feet long and 2 feet wide. It was a metal ladder
that could be broken down into five 4-foot sections and easily
reassembled to its full length of 20 feet. The ladder had been
designed by Monaghan and custom built for him. He had used the
ladder on other second-story jobs. Boston Billy always left the lad-
der behind him after a job, as his signature.
They walked to the solarium, which they knew was just under
the master bedroom. Monaghan opened the metal ladder and
locked each section in place. Quietly they placed the ladder against
the building and made their ascent. Later, one of Blake’s footprints
would be discovered in the soft earth around the flowerbed.
Barry and Monaghan made the ascent onto the balcony. Mon-
aghan took out a butcher knife and quietly popped the brass clasp,
and they entered the hallway that led to the anteroom of the Liv-
ermores’ master bedroom. The butcher knife would later be found
discarded among the shrubbery. Kane and Blake returned to the
hidden getaway car to wait for the pickup signal.
Dorothy Livermore lay in bed awake. She had heard a noise. She
poked her husband in the ribs. “J.L., did you hear something?”
“No, Mousie, now go back to sleep.”
“I’m sure I heard something. Listen.” They both listened and
both heard a noise.
“I’m getting up to see what’s happening,” she said.
“I’ll get the gun.”
Dorothy left the bed and slipped on her robe. She entered the
hall that led to their massive closets and to their individual bath-
rooms. A dark figure wearing a hat and carrying a gun stood in
black silhouette in the hallway.

“Can I help you?” she calmly asked Barry.
“Probably. Probably you can help me. Go back into your room
and tell your husband to stay in bed.”
Dorothy did as she was told.
Livermore sat on the edge of the bed. He gently lifted the tele-
phone receiver from the hook and placed the open phone on the
table, hoping the operator would hear what was going on.
“I think you should just take what you want and leave,”
Dorothy said to the stickup men. “I have my two little sons asleep
in this house, and I don’t want them hurt.”
“They won’t be hurt, just sit yourselves down and remain
calm,” Barry said.
“Where are your guests sleeping?” Monaghan asked.
“Down the hall, fourth door on the left,” Dorothy said.
“I’m going down there. You keep these two here,” Monaghan
said.
He walked down the hall, entered the room, and woke the
Aronhsons. He placed the muzzle of his gun against Mrs.
Aronhson’s temple. “Now sir, give me that platinum wristwatch
you’re wearing, that star sapphire ring, and get up and go over to
the dresser and give me the pearl stickpin and the cash that’s laying
on the dresser.” Aronhson did as he was told. Monaghan counted
the money. There was $200. He stripped out two $1 bills. “Here,
use this to take a cab home,” he said, handing the cash to
Aronhson. “Now, if you value your life and Mr. and Mrs. Liver-
more’s life, you will lie here until they come to get you.”
Monaghan walked back to the master bedroom and joined
Barry.
“I hope you didn’t hurt our guests,” Dorothy said.
“No. Your guests are fine, just fine. I even left them two dollars
for a cab ride home.”

“Two dollars? They live in the city,” Dorothy said.
The men laughed, even Livermore. “Well they can take a cab to
the train station, can’t they?” Monaghan said, smiling. “Let’s see
your hand.”
Barry held the barrel of his pistol against her arm while Mon-
aghan slipped a beautiful blue sapphire ring off her finger. Mon-
aghan then went to Livermore, took a similar ring off his finger,
and said, “Hey, almost a matching pair, how sweet.”
“Oh, please, don’t take those, they were Christmas presents!”
Monaghan looked at the rings and sighed, then looked back at
Dorothy, who was crying. “I beg your pardon then, ma’am,” he
said, and handed back the two rings, worth more than $15,000.
Monaghan continued, “We’re more interested in what’s in the
safe. Open it, Mr. Livermore.”
“There’s nothing in it,” he said.
“We’ll just take a look anyway,” Barry added, still holding the
gun on Dorothy.
“I can’t see the combination without my glasses,” Livermore
said.
“Where are your glasses?” Monaghan said.
“In the dressing room.”
“Take me there,” Monaghan said, putting his gun against Liver-
more’s shoulder. He escorted Livermore into the dressing room,
and they emerged with the glasses.
The thief walked Livermore directly over to the portrait that
was hung in front of the hidden safe. He swung the portrait clear.
“Open it!”
Livermore slipped on his spectacles and attempted to open it,
but his hands trembled so badly that he was unable to work the
combination. “I can’t seem to work it,” he said.
“Step aside, sir,” Monaghan commanded. “I’ll fix it. Wait a
minute.”He left and vanished down the ladder for a bag of burglary

tools. In seconds he was back. With a hammer and chisel, he popped
the safe like it was a child’s toy. He took out a few papers and cast
them aside in disgust. “That’s it? Just these worthless papers?”
“That’s all there is!” Dorothy cried, “Now take what you have
and leave, please.”
The thieves quickly went through the bedroom and the dress-
ing rooms. There were jewels scattered everywhere. They gath-
ered up a pearl necklace worth $80,000 and a sapphire and
diamond ring of Dorothy’s worth $15,000. They already had the
$200 in cash taken from Aronhson, a pearl stickpin valued at
$2,000, and a square diamond ring worth $1,000. The Livermore
jewels were properly appraised and insured for 80 percent of their
value.
The thieves left behind over $20,000 in sapphires that were
lying on the dressing table. They also ignored Livermore’s gold
cuff links and diamond studs. They discussed the jewels as they
gathered them, describing them and estimating their value as they
dropped them into a bag.
In all, they were in the house for almost an hour, taking their
time chatting and examining the rooms. The police were later to
comment that in most such robberies, the thieves would be in and
out in less than 10 minutes.
The thieves exited down the steel ladder and trotted to the end
of the driveway, where Blake and Kane were waiting in the
Chrysler roadster. They jumped into the car and raced toward the
Manhasset railway station.
Mrs. John Gernan, who lived near the railway stop, observed
the men and the woman between 5:30 and 5:45 A.M. on Sunday.
She watched the group from her window. She told the New York
Daily Newson May 31, 1927:“I was unable to sleep and was awake
early Sunday, and I heard an automobile and looked out. I saw a
canary colored Chrysler automobile with three men and a blonde

girl. Her hair was short. She wore a sport coat and no hat. She
appeared young, about 18. Because of the early hour I wondered
what the girl was doing out with three men. I watched them drive
toward the railroad station, stop the car, and get out. They walked
in the direction of the station, disappearing from my view.”
Mrs. Gernan had good powers of observation:“I didn’t hear a
train come through, but then I wasn’t listening particularly. In fact,
I went back to bed and to sleep. I knew it was the car that was
taken from Walter Roesler’s garage, the car that belonged to
George Owens, because later in the day, after the police found the
car, I saw the owner come and drive it away.”
What Mrs. Gernan could not see was the gang stealing a taxicab
and driving it into New York City, where they abandoned it.
On Monday, nerves shattered by the robbery, the Aronhsons
beat a hasty retreat to New York. They had planned to remain over
Memorial Day but changed their minds. Livermore provided his
Rolls to take them into the city.
Dorothy was not inclined to have her holiday spoiled. She called
some friends in New York, and by noon, six guests, plus the Liv-
ermore children and their nannies, boarded the Livermore’s pala-
tial yacht. The yacht was fully provisioned. They left from the
private pier behind the estate, without leaving word when they
would return.
Meanwhile, Percy G. Rockefeller, who had been robbed of
$19,000 at dinner during a previous Boston Billy burglary, had
engaged the Burns detective agency to investigate independently
of the police. On the news of the Livermore robbery, Burns
immediately sent down a detective, Michael Rincones, who was
joined by Detectives Paul Crowley and Jesse Mayforth of the Nas-
sau County Police Department. All three men were heavily armed
and on patrol at the Livermore estate.
Captain of Detectives Harold R. King of the Nassau County

Police Department was named the lead investigator in charge of the
case. There had been a string of other such robberies on Long Island
and in New York. The police suspected the Boston Billy gang of
having stolen over $1 million in jewels and cash over the prior three
years. The gang was suspected in the robberies of Percy G. Rocke-
feller of Greenwich, Connecticut; William Durant of Deal, New
Jersey, the largest shareholder of General Motors;Joshua E. Cosden
ofPort Washington, Long Island, who was robbed during the Prince
of Wales’s visit;and several other wealthy and powerful people.
Livermore found out from the police why removing the tele-
phone from the cradle did no good. The switch on the telephone
was set on intercom, so it would only connect to the other phones
in the house, and all the servants were asleep.
On Wednesday, June 1, Livermore read his mail. The postmark
was Brooklyn:“We are coming to see you again tonight, and we
are coming to see you on business.” Signed:The Gentlemen Rob-
bers. The letter was written in pencil.
That evening, a servant answered the phone;a man’s voice was
on the other end.
“Is Mr. Livermore in?” the man asked.
“No,” the servant replied.
“Tell Mr. Livermore that it would be a serious matter if he
didn’t heed the warning we gave him.”
After reviewing the letter, Captain King sent four plainclothes
officers to the Livermore estate for security. Livermore also had his
own private detectives on the job.
On June 5, six days after the Livermore robbery, the police got
a break. The Nassau County Police Department got a phone tip
that a suspect in the Livermore robbery was on an eastbound train
due at Ronkonkoma at 7:13 P.M. Ronkonkoma was 50 miles from
Pennsylvania Station on the main line of the Long Island Railroad,
at the end of the Long Island Motor Parkway.

• 184 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
The train pulled into the station at Ronkonkoma on time.
Waiting were three Nassau County detectives, led by Captain
King, and one Suffolk County detective. They were waiting on
the platform for the passengers.
Arthur Barry and Anna Blake exited the train. The detectives
moved in, walking quickly up to the couple. When Barry spotted
the four detectives he reached for his hip, as if to draw his gun. He
then bolted and ran back on the train. Blake stayed on the plat-
form. One of the detectives moved in on her. The three other
detectives drew their guns and followed after Barry, racing down
the aisles of the train, from car to car in a wild chase. They finally
boxed him into a corner. Guns drawn and pointed, Captain King
shouted, “Give up now, or you’re dead.”
Barry surrendered.
Meanwhile, on the platform, the detective moved in on Blake
as she tried to dispose of a small pasteboard box. The detective
ripped the box out of her hands and cuffed her. Inside the box was
stolen jewelry worth $15,000.
The detectives hurried the captured suspects into the car they
had driven from Mineola, Long Island, and sped off, headed for
Blake’s home.
The wild chase and gunplay had caused the passengers and the
station agent to believe that the detectives, who were in plain
clothes, were really robbers who had attacked and kidnapped a
couple of innocent passengers. The passengers alerted the station
agent, who immediately called the Suffolk and Nassau County
police and informed them that a robbery and kidnapping had
taken place on the train station platform at Ronkonkoma. He
described it as an old-time, wild-West-style train robbery and kid-
napping. Believing the report, the Suffolk and Nassau County
police put out a general alarm for a Ford or a Chevy with New
York license plates 2Z33. The alarm was called off when the

license plate checked out to be issued to the Nassau County Dis-
trict Attorney’s Office.
Meanwhile, the detectives were quickly taken to Blake’s home,
where they also arrested Barry’s brother.
The next day, June 6, in a room on the top floor of the Nassau
County Courthouse at Mineola, Arthur Barry signed a confession
that he and his associate, whom he knew as Bill or Earl “Boston
Billy” Williams, committed the $100,000 robbery on the Liver-
more estate the previous week. Barry had cut a deal with Nassau
County District Attorney Elvin Edwards. Edwards had promised
that in return for making a clean breast of the whole story, he
would free Barry’s companion, Blake, and his brother William
Barry. And he would drop all charges against them, since Barry
insisted they had nothing to do with any crimes he was involved in.
After Barry signed his confession, a group of detectives headed
for New York. They raided a rooming house on the West Side of
Manhattan, near Central Park, just missing Boston Billy Mon-
aghan by minutes. Barry had provided the address as part of his
plea agreement.
Jesse and Dorothy Livermore were brought into the district
attorney’s office in Mineola soon after the confession was signed.
They were unable to recognize Barry as one of the burglars since
it was dark at the time of the robbery. But the incidents that sur-
rounded the robbery and the circumstances of Barry’s arrest con-
vinced them that he was one of the robbers.
For instance, Barry reminded Dorothy that when she had asked
him for a cigarette, he gave her one and lit it for her;and that he
had returned her sapphire pinky ring when she asked him not to
steal it and had said “I hope it brings you luck.”
The police were also able to identify an $800 wristwatch that
had been stolen from a residence in Rumson, New Jersey. This was
the first tie-in with a string of reported burglaries.

In his confession, Barry said that he had met Monaghan at the
Pennsylvania Station and that Monaghan had shown him a news-
paper article reporting that the Livermores would have guests at a
party that night. They rode to the Great Neck station and walked
to the Livermore estate. Barry explained, “I went into this scheme
with Billy to rob this place, and I knew it was contrary to law. I was
sincerely sorry after I found out that Mr. and Mrs. Livermore were
such good sports under the stress of the circumstances. But I still
went through with the job.”
Barry went on to explain that they had found the Chrysler
roadster at a neighbor’s house and stolen it. He explained that they
drove to the Great Neck train station and just missed the train, so
they commandeered an Overland taxicab that was standing empty
at the station and drove to the outskirts of New York City, where
they abandoned it.
The police checked Barry’s prints and came up with warrants
for his arrest in Massachusetts and Connecticut. They also discov-
ered that he was charged in Scarsdale, New York, with the 1923
murder of Patrol Sergeant John Harrison, but Barry insisted that a
companion had done the actual shooting, and the charges were
dropped to assault. He was sentenced to three months, but
couldn’t stand it in jail. He escaped with only 15 days left to serve
in his sentence. A friend had smuggled a saw into the jail.
The press described Blake as an attractive blond about 35 years
old, a little over 5 feet tall, and dressed in a black silk coat over an
unusually long black dress, topped off by a close-fitting black hat
with gold embroidery. She and William Barry were not charged,
as agreed in the plea bargain.
The police got deep into the information given to them by
Barry and were astounded as the number of robberies he disclosed
kept increasing—from 8 to 15 to 22 homes. The list of people

It also surfaced that the only one who could have provided
inside information about the Livermore estate was the former
chauffeur, Eddie Kane. A warrant was drawn for his arrest.
At this point, the police finally revealed how they had tracked
down Barry and Blake. They had received two anonymous tele-
phone calls, which they traced to a pay phone in the Bronx, one on
Tuesday night and one on Wednesday night before the arrest on Sun-
day. The caller did not identify himself. He told the Nassau County
police of a split in the gang over the division of the spoils in the Liv-
ermore robbery, including the information that one of the gang
members had been hit over the head with an iron rod during a fight.
The caller gave Barry’s name and revealed the time and destination
of their train. He also provided descriptions of Barry and Blake.
Barry was questioned further on the murder of Sergeant Harri-
son. He claimed it was Monaghan who had committed the mur-
der. This enraged Monaghan when he read about it in the papers,
and he actually sent a handwritten letter to the New York Times.He
described Barry as “a lying rat who would send his own brother to
the chair.” Monaghan also claimed that he had proof that Barry
had killed Sergeant Harrison.
The number of robberies continued to climb. Barry took the
police on a tour of 22 houses in Westchester County alone, where
he and Monaghan had looted over $500,000, mostly in jewelry. In
one of the houses in Rye, Mr. Murray, the victim, said to Barry, “I
want to thank you for the gentlemanly way in which you robbed
me. Do you remember what you did with the college pins that
were in the loot?”
Barry pointed to a place in the grass by some bushes, and said
“We threw them there. They were worthless to us.”

When the police left, Murray was on his hands and knees look-
ing for the pins in the grass.
The cops took Barry up to Scarsdale, where he reenacted the
details ofthe murder ofOfficer Harrison. Monaghan was described
as a gunman, a hard drinker, and a great ladies’ man.
The final tally for all the burglaries grew to $2 million over a
three-year period. On July 6, Barry was sentenced to 25 years in
prison at hard labor. He looked down at his smooth, white hands
and smiled a grim, resolute smile when he was sentenced.
Blake ran up to him, threw her arms around him, and kissed
him hard on the mouth, slipping a roll of bills into his hands for his
prison expenses. As he was hauled off, she collapsed in tears. Barry
blamed Monaghan for ratting him out. He said he was just about
to sail to Europe and a new life with Blake when he was arrested.
On July 7, Detective Gordon Hurley of the Nassau County
police waited at the back door ofa bungalow in Sound View, Con-
necticut. Detective Charles Sheraton of the Burns agency stood by
the front door. Sheraton had been retained by Percy G. Rocke-
feller after he had been robbed at gunpoint. Sheraton had been on
Monaghan’s trail for seven months now. He had just missed Mon-
aghan on several occasions. He was not going to miss him again.
On a prearranged signal, they broke the front door open. Mon-
aghan was inside. He sprang for his gun and ran through the house
for the back door. Detective Hurley stood in the rear doorway and
calmly shot Monaghan through the leg as he dodged from side to
side in the hallway. Monaghan collapsed in a heap and screamed in
pain. He was taken to Memorial Associated Hospital, where he
received treatment.
In the hospital, Monaghan admitted to several robberies, but
not the Livermore robbery. He also denied killing Scarsdale Patrol
Sergeant Harrison, as his former partner Barry had claimed. After
his arrest, Monaghan told the police that he was an avid reader of

the society news. This gave him his leads. He would find out what
families were giving dinners, when they were giving them, and
who the guests were going to be.
Eyewitnesses later confirmed that it was Monaghan who had
robbed their houses.
His mother, Mary Monaghan, came to visit him in jail. She
broke down and wept when they met. She said, “I hope you will
come out of it all right, my son.”
He replied, “Well, ma, we’ll wait and see. I’ve got a good lawyer.”
Later she told reporters, “He may be a criminal, but I still love
him.” She cried, “I trust in God to bring him through. I will stand
by him, and he can have my last dollar if he needs it.”
The next day, they brought Barry in from Sing Sing prison to
testify against Monaghan before a grand jury. Barry persisted in his
accusation that Monaghan had killed the Scarsdale police sergeant.
But Monaghan accused Barry of the killing, saying “Barry is only
trying to blame me so he can get himself into the clear.”
Nassau County District Attorney Edwards decided to ask the
Nassau County Grand Jury to indict James Monaghan, alias Boston
Billy, as a fourth offender under the Baumes laws, which would
mean life imprisonment without parole for Monaghan, if con-
victed. Monaghan had three prior felony convictions in Massachu-
setts and was wanted on a fugitive warrant for escaping from prison.
On July 21, a check of the spoons used by prisoners revealed
that one was missing. Monaghan’s cell was searched, and the
guards found a spoon filed down into a device that could be used
to pick a lock. The Nassau County sheriff immediately ordered
that Monaghan be placed in solitary confinement. Monaghan
resisted violently. He was finally subdued. He screamed, “I’ll go
crazy in solitary. Let me out of this dump.”
“If he gets any worse,” Sheriff Stronson said, “I’ll put him in a
straitjacket.”

The next day, while locked in solitary, Monaghan set fire to his
mattress. The sheriff then placed a guard outside his cell.
The day his trial was to begin, July 29, Monaghan pleaded guilty
to the charges of burglary. The charge of killing Scarsdale Patrol
Sergeant Harrison was dropped. Monaghan received a 50-year sen-
tence. As he entered the courtroom for sentencing he was heard say-
ing, “Well, here I am. I’ll get life, I suppose, but I’ll be out soon.”
His escape threat was taken seriously. He was taken to Sing Sing
prison under heavy guard, right up until the prison ferry picked
him up at College Point. On the way there, Monaghan again
vowed to Sheriff Stronson that he would escape from prison.
On January 6, 1929, Nassau County detectives brought in
Eddie Kane, the former chauffeur involved in the Livermore rob-
bery, from Kenosha, Wisconsin, after a two-year search. On Janu-
ary 7, Kane pleaded guilty. On May 22, Kane was sentenced to
three and a half to five years in a state penitentiary.
Both Dorothy and Jesse Livermore were shocked to find out
that Kane had aided the robbers. They refused to believe he was
involved until he finally confessed to the crime.
The report of the possible plot to kidnap his children in Palm
Beach in March 1925 and the 1927 robbery by the Boston Billy
gang, as well as the gang’s subsequent threats and the long pursuit
of the robbers, left Livermore badly depressed and very protective
of his family.
But it did not stop the irrepressible Dorothy from throwing
grand parties whenever the spirit moved her.

The Crash of 1929
There is nothing unique about the crash of ’29. It is something
that happens about every 20 to 30 years, because that is the
length of the financial memory. It is about the length of time
needed for a new set ofsuckers to come in and imagine that they
have a new and wonderful fix on the future.”

LIVERMORE’S CONCENTRATION ON THE TURBULENT,
boiling bull market of early 1929 was briefly distracted by a sur-
prise lawsuit.
On April 4, 1929, 93 investors sued the Mizner Development
Corporation, which included Livermore and T. Coleman Du Pont
as directors, for $1.45 million. These investors claimed that they
had suffered in the crash of the Boca Raton land boom. Maximil-
ian Morgenthau, the son of former ambassador to Turkey Henry
Morgenthau, led this group of disgruntled investors.
Morgenthau filed an 870-page complaint. It was the longest
complaint ever filed up to that time. The complaint stated that the
Mizner Development Corporation had committed fraud. It stated
that the Boca Raton, Florida, lots had been misrepresented and
that the Mizner Development Corporation, the promoter of the
development, had operated without any prior knowledge of real
estate sales and management.
The complaint further stated that the criminal operation was
initiated on April 12, 1925, when the promoters had appointed as
president Addison Mizner, an architect with no experience in real
estate development. Mizner had then appointed his brother, Wil-
son Mizner, a playwright with no qualifications in real estate, as
secretary of the company.
The press had a field day with the suit. The corporation’s direc-
tors quickly and privately settled it. The details of the settlement
were never disclosed. The entire matter quietly drifted off the
newspaper pages.
The problem had begun in 1925, when Addison Mizner, a
famous Palm Beach architect, had the brilliant idea to develop
Boca Raton, an undeveloped area just south of Palm Beach.
Mizner wanted to build the world’s most architecturally beautiful
playground. He wanted to construct a magnificent 1,000-room
hotel, a polo field, and a casino in the first year and expand from

there into a massive land development scheme that would include
three more major hotels.
A syndicate, the Mizner Development Corporation, was
formed to oversee and finance the ambitious development. The
group was made up of leading financial, entertainment, and social
luminaries, including Harold Vanderbilt, Paris Singer, Jesse Liver-
more, Irving Berlin, W. K. Vanderbilt II, Addison and Wilson
Mizner, Elizabeth Arden, T. Coleman Du Pont, and Rodman
Wanamaker, to name a few.
The syndicate purchased two miles of beachfront around the
Boca Raton inlet and 1,600 acres of land. An offering of $500,000
of the new syndicate’s original $5 million capital investment was
offered for sale to the public. It was sold out in less than a week.
Land prices in the area surrounding the proposed development
skyrocketed.
This ad appeared in the Palm Beach Post on May 15, 1925:
The owners and controllers of the Mizner Development
Corporation are a group of very rich men and women of
unlimited means who propose to build from the creative
genius of Addison Mizner what will most likely be the most
wonderful resort city in the world. The combined wealth of
the stockholders probably represents over one-third of the
entire wealth of the United States. It is reasonable to suppose
that every lot buyer should make quick and large profits.
The prominent backers’ names were used in all the ads and
marketing efforts to promote the corporation. On August 6, the
directors were elected. Du Pont, recently elected senator from
Delaware, was made chairman of the board, and Livermore was
made head of the finance committee. It did not take Livermore
and the finance committee long to find out what was going on and

to object to the use of their names in promoting the development
project. They strenuously denounced this bandying about of their
names as if they were personally guaranteeing the financial success
of the project.
They also objected to promising the new purchasers of land that
three more hotels would be built, including a Ritz-Carlton, as well
as three golf courses, polo fields, and miles of excellent paved
streets throughout the development.
Finally, before the year was out, on November 24, Du Pont
resigned, saying to the press that proper business methods were not
being used, although the project had great possibilities. Livermore
and several other directors resigned, as well.
These resignations and problems in the press brought about the
immediate demise of the Boca Raton land boom. In its first six
months of operation, the marketing company had achieved sales of
over $25 million. But with the board of directors breaking up and
Du Pont’s negative comments appearing in the New York Times,
sales ended abruptly, and the project shut down.
This left Livermore with another good lesson:Stick to what you
know, which in his case was the stock market. He set back to work
to recoup the money he had lost in the Florida land deal, a deal his
prominent Palm Beach friends had told him just could not fail.
From the winter of 1928 until the early spring of 1929, Livermore
was a full-fledged bull in a runaway bull market, but he was look-
ing for the market to signal the turn, the inevitable turn, and he
was waiting to sell out his long positions. Experience had taught
him that it was always best to sell early into a strong market, espe-
cially when he had substantial line of stocks to sell off.
In the early summer of 1929, still in the heat of a bull market,
Livermore finally sold out all his long positions. He made a list of
the leading stocks that he believed were overextended.

THE CRASH OF 1929 • 195 •
The line of least resistance had changed from bullish to sideways
movement. He asked himselfwhether this sideways movement was
merely a correction from the upward spike of the bull market, or
the beginning of a major change in the direction of the overall
market. Had the market trend changed? Was it changing in front
of everyone’s eyes, and was the greed factor too strong for people
to see the top?
All of Livermore’s experience and instincts screamed at him,
telling him this was a top. But he knew timing was everything. It
was not whether the top was coming;it was when the top was com-
ing. He had been wrong before by going in early only to find out
that he had been correct but had made his move too soon. He
decided to follow his developed method of sending out probes to
establish small positions on the short side of the market.
Operating out of his war room, his suite of offices in the
Heckscher Building at 730 Fifth Avenue, he began his operation
secretly. Constantly changing brokers, using as many as 100 bro-
kers to disguise his moves over the next six months, telling no one
of his strategy, using his secret symbols on the chalkboard, and
keeping away from the press until all his positions were established,
he tested the market.
He sent out his probes by selling several stocks short, small posi-
tions. The market continued upward, and he had to cover them,
losing well over $250,000, a small part of his capital. He had his
full crew of six chalkboard markers working everyday on the long
catwalk. He was active on his direct phone lines to the London and
Paris markets. The direct line to the grain pits in Chicago showed
him that the prices of all major commodities were dropping to all-
time lows, across the board. Because of his constant and never-
ending queries into economics, both in the United States and
abroad, he felt that the world was looking at a serious deflation.
He set out a second line of probes, testing his strong feelings

again, but they did not hold, and he had to cover them when the
market moved against him. But then in the late summer, for the
third time, he set out his probes. They held.
They were suddenly profitable—not big profits, but at least they
were profitable. Now he fully believed he was right.
His patience had paid off. It was one of the reasons he liked fish-
ing, if you did the right thing, were persistent and patient, eventu-
ally you would catch fish. Now that he had a fish on the hook, he
had to reel it in. This time he knew he was right. And he was pre-
pared to back his play with sizable positions.
He was famous as the Boy Plunger, the Great Bear of Wall
Street, and the Lone Wolf ofWall Street. He was ready to truly live
up to his reputation.
In the summer of 1929, Livermore set out his short line while
the market was still strong enough to accept his trades. It was also
easy for him to borrow the necessary stock against his short posi-
tions, because practically everyone was bullish and thought it mad-
ness to be selling short. Things could not be better:The economy
was great, liquidity was great, there was plenty of money around
for businesses to borrow, and there was no sign of inflation—in
fact, consumer prices were falling. His friends asked him why he
would want to sell.
Livermore watched all this, and his famous instinct took over—
his gut instinct, which he believed was not instinct at all. Rather,
it was the sum total of all his experience and all his knowledge that
was keeping his dreams fitful at night, stealing sleep—subconscious
rumblings.
There were plenty of signals as the market finally topped. It did
not just shoot up in a spike in one grand climax and fall to earth.
No, like all markets before, it moved inexorably, slowly, like a giant
ship at sea, but the market gave signals, signals that Livermore had
seen before: The leaders were struggling, unable to make new

highs;the smart money was selling into the strong, driving greed
of the public.
The public had arrived in the market in full force. The mechan-
ics, the barbers, the shoe clerks, the paper carriers, the housewives,
and the farmers were all trading on 10 percent margin. It was
apparent to them that winning in the stock market was an easy
game;invest your money and prosper. It was a new time in history,
a time like never before, a time of endless prosperity, with a simple
formula:Buy stocks and get rich. Stocks went one way—up, up,
and up. This was a new era of perpetual prosperity—and, most
important, the little guy could participate.
Livermore watched stocks rise with wild capitalization, good
stocks selling at 30, 40, 50, 60 times their annual earnings. These
were stocks that had normally traded at 8 to 12 times earnings.
Plus, the wild speculative stocks, like the new high-technology
radio companies, took off. They were the trendy, favored stocks.
He also observed the leaders, the stocks that had led the market
upward. He watched as they stalled and corrected, failing to make
new highs, drifting back when they met a wave of distribution as
the smart money hit the road.
In the fall of 1929, Livermore sat in his office and watched
through the big glass window as his crew of six markers, wearing
headphones, marked the movement of stocks on the green chalk-
board. The symbols made music for him, but it was now a wild
crescendo, the climax to the end of a great symphony, years and
years of sweet music. Now the end was near;the tempo was up,
out of control, on the verge of wildness;the chords were often dis-
cordant to his ears. He moved out of his office and sat for hours at
his long, shiny, mahogany conference table. He sat in silence,
watching the markers moving on the catwalk. As he watched, his
resolve grew. This was the end. Every once in a while he would go
into his private office and make a trade. He would then tell Harry

Edgar Dache, his trusted assistant, who would enter it into the
book.
Often, at the end of the day, as a game, he would race Dache for
a tally of where he stood, his exact equity balance, to the penny.
Livermore would do the calculations in his head and, just as Dache
was about to shout the answer given by the machine, he would
hold up his hand and utter a number quietly, the number he had
calculated mentally. Dache would just nod. Livermore was always
correct.
Then it struck—the storm broke.
The cataclysm struck in full fury as soon as trading began. In

secret meeting in a cramped, smoke-filled room beneath the
floor of the market and anxiously debated whether to sus-
pend trading completely until the panic subsided.
Across the news tickers that morning came a sequence of
terse urgent messages: “Federal Reserve Board is in session
in Washington with Secretary Mellon. Cabinet is meeting.
President Hoover conferring with Secretary of Commerce
Lamont. Leading bankers gathering at the office of J. P. Mor-
gan Jr., to discuss the deteriorating situation.” As the extent
of the financial debacle became clear—15 billion worth of
stock values had vanished into thin air, wiping out the life
savings of investors across the nation—the human toll began
to mount.
Businessmen whose companies went bankrupt suffered
heart attacks. Ruined speculators leaped from hotel windows,
or shut all windows and turned on the gas, or swallowed poi-
son, or simply shot themselves. Behind them, in the wreck-
age of lifetimes of hard work, dreams and fatal illusions, they
left notes that read:“Everything lost. Tell the boys I can’t pay
what I owe them.”
The great crash, when securities on the nation’s stock
exchanges lost more than a third of their value in a heart-
breaking avalanche that haunted the memories of an entire
generation. When the dreams of hundreds of thousands of
American investors—mostly members of the middle-class
including secretaries, clerks, elderly spinsters, and small-
business men—vanished in the smash-up along with hard
earned savings. The great crash that battered the country,
inflicting severe psychological trauma whose effects were still
plainly visible more than a decade later.

The next day, Black Tuesday, was worse:The market fell 11.7
percent in one day.
Livermore was personally blamed for the crash. Even the New
York Timesran an article attributing the crash to his strong and con-
stant short-selling attack on the market. Once again he was the
center of a major drama, and his life was threatened.
The calls seemed never-ending. He personally answered the
phone. He told Dache to put the angry calls through to him. The
threats came in letters and telegrams, as well. After a while he
stopped answering the phone. But the calls worried him for his
safety and the safety of his family.
For Livermore, there was no joy in the misery of others. He
wondered how his life had come to this sad point. It was his great-
est single day in the market, his greatest victory. Why did he feel
so hollow and empty?
In the early part of the twentieth century, depression was con-
sidered a mental condition caused by emotional instability or
weakness of character. Clinical depression had not yet been dis-
covered. Chemical imbalance as the cause ofaberrant behavior was
a theory not yet born. For serious cases of depression through
most of the century, patients were often subjected to electroshock
treatment. Electrodes were attached to the skull, and a terrific blast
of electricity was applied to the cranium, searing into the brain.
There is no proof that this therapy did anything but cause brain
damage to the patient.
In 1930, besides his depression, Livermore had other personal
problems. His wife Dorothy, his beloved Mousie, was drinking
heavily, and her mother had become her complete alter ego. They
shopped together and traveled together. Her mother’s residence
occupied one entire wing of the mansion at Evermore, and
Dorothy sought her advice on every household and personal mat-

ter. Their main preoccupation was spending Livermore’s money,
primarily in decorating the various Livermore homes.
Dorothy’s mother also loved to gamble. She was well off and
used her own money. She was a good gambler. She won more than
she lost.
On a European trip in 1930, they traveled to Spain to visit the
American ambassador, Jesse’s good friend Alexander P. Moore.
Livermore had covered for Moore in his torrid affair with Lillian
Russell. While they were in Spain, Moore introduced Dorothy’s
mother to the king of Spain, whom she promptly engaged in a
torrid affair. The affair lasted for several months. She stayed on in
Spain, gambling at the casino almost every night and having her
fling with the king.
Dorothy thought it was charming, since her mother had been a
widow for years. Livermore and Moore were bewildered by the
whole affair and just shook their heads in silence.
Livermore often resented his mother-in-law. He felt isolated
from his wife, and he believed that her mother’s presence was a
barrier between them. He was never an outgoing, gregarious type
of person, and he kept his feelings to himself, so he never men-
tioned these feelings to Dorothy. He was, in fact, like his straitlaced
New England parents, emotionally constipated. Reticence to dis-
play his feelings was ingrained in his personality. He considered it
necessary to act like a poker player in his business, to never tip his
hand or to react emotionally. Because of this inability and unwill-
ingness to express his emotions, the stress on him was permanent.
The only relief came when he sold out his market positions and
took a vacation, or went out on his yacht, something he did more
and more as he grew older.
He had another recreation, a secret recreation. Livermore had a
weakness for beautiful women. And some women had a weakness

for a powerful man with unlimited money and the seductive aura
of a secretive life spent stalking the dark corridors of Wall Street
and the dimly lit halls of high finance.
He cut a mysterious, elegant figure, always dressed perfectly in
his Saville Row suits and perfectly groomed. He was shaved every
morning by his personal barber and had his hair perfectly trimmed
daily. Livermore always had access to beautiful women through Flo
Ziegfield and others like him. He also met many women at the
endless parties thrown by Mousie and his neighbors on Long Island.
Livermore started spending more and more nights in secret
liaisons in New York during the week. Rumors were born and
started to subtly circulate in the high societies of Long Island’s
Great Neck community and the caverns of Wall Street. These
rumors eventually found their way to Dorothy’s ears. She con-
fronted her beloved J.L.
“J.L., I’m hearing terrible things about you.”
“Like what?”
“Other women, beautiful women, showgirls like I used to be,
who are associated with you.”
“Look Mousie . . .”
“No. I won’t have it, and I refuse to discuss it.”
“But you brought this up for discussion.”
“Don’t try to get off the subject and distract me. I simply don’t
want to discuss it. Tell me it’s not true, J.L.”
“It’s not true.”
“That’s the last of it then, and if it were true, I want it to be
untrue, and stop.”
“Don’t worry, Mousie.”
She smiled and took his hand. She did not believe him, but she
hoped he would stop. She drank more, and threw more parties at
Evermore, on the yacht, at the Breakers in Palm Beach, and at
their home in Lake Placid.

Livermore did not stop. His affairs continued, but his private life
never interfered with his business life, because his business life was
his real life, the life he truly loved and the game he could never get
enough of. The mental challenge of speculation was the high of
his life, the vital force that coursed through his veins. It was an
endless thrill for him, just as the ticker tape itself endlessly unrav-
eled its secrets. Each secret he found on trading the market was a
revelation to him, made him feel like an explorer opening the door
to King Tut’s tomb and viewing the secrets within for the first
time.

LIVERMORE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AT THE BEACH
Club in Palm Beach during 1930. He and Ed Bradley, the owner,
had become fast friends. Gambling was illegal in Florida when
Bradley set up the club, but he had the tacit approval of Henry
Flagler, the railroad baron and partner in Standard Oil. This was
the only real approval necessary.
Bradley’s articles of incorporation said that the Beach Club was
incorporated for social purposes, including any games or amuse-
ments that the management and its members might from time to
time agree upon.
The rules included an age restriction of 25, a prohibition on
smoking in the gambling area, a requirement that all debts be set-
tled in 24 hours, and a strict dress code that required full evening
dress after 7 P.M., without exceptions. White tie and tails were
standard attire;a tuxedo was the minimum dress allowed.
An unwritten rule of the Beach Club was that no Florida resi-
dents were to be admitted. This rule was copied from Monte
Carlo, where the locals were not allowed entry to the casino. But
this was just a convenient rule for Bradley to apply at his discre-
tion. He did not want any of the locals hurt too badly financially,
because they might raise a ruckus with the law. He used his own
personal judgment, and he admitted only those locals whom he
considered suitable for admission. These, of course were the rich
and powerful citizens who helped guarantee he would remain
open. Bradley’s Beach Club operated in Palm Beach under these
and other rules for more than 45 years.
One January evening in 1930, close to 7 P.M.,Livermore walked
into the casino dressed in white tie and tails. Livermore enjoyed
clothes. They hung very well on his slim body. The tails had been
custom made for him in England. He had had four sets made sev-
eral years before, and they remained unaltered. Livermore’s weight
never varied.

He went into the gaming room and found his close friend Wal-
ter P. Chrysler, still in his golfing outfit, sitting at the roulette
wheel, fully engrossed in the spinning wheel and the little black
bouncing ball. He sat down next to him. Chrysler looked up and
saw that Livermore was dressed for the evening.
“Hello, Walter.”
“Hi, J.L., you’re dressed. Is it that late?”
“It’s ten to seven,” Livermore answered.
“Time flies when you’re losing money.”
“Bad?”
“About five grand on the wrong side of things.”
As the clock moved minutes away from 7, Bradley walked up to
the roulette wheel. The croupier looked at him. Bradley reached
out for the little black ball. The croupier handed it to him.
“Walter, it’s almost seven. You need to change clothes.”
“I need to change my luck. Ed, I’m down about five grand here.
I want to play it out.”
“When you change and come back. We’ll keep your seat for
you. We’re open until four in the morning,” Bradley said.
“Ed look . . .”
“Walter,” Bradley stared at him for a second. He was not used
to being questioned. Neither was Chrysler. Bradley reached into
his pocket and took out his lucky silver dollar. “Suppose we flip for
whatever you’re down.”
“All right.”
“You call it, Walter.”
“Heads.”
Bradley flipped the coin and as it arched over and headed down-
ward he snatched the coin out of the air.
“You win, Walter,” Bradley said, not looking at the coin. He
nodded at the croupier to replace the chips that Chrysler had lost.
After Chrysler left, Livermore and Bradley settled down at a small

cocktail table in the dining room. The dining crowd did not hit
the club until at least 8. It was quiet. Bradley ordered his soda water,
Livermore his old-fashioned. They sat in silence for a moment.
Livermore broke the silence. “You always get your own way, Ed?”
“Not always, but I don’t like to see my rules broken. You must
have rules, don’t you J.L.?”
“Yes, and I’m sorry to say I break them once in a while.”
“I hear you didn’t break them in the Crash.”
“No, not this time. This time I played by my rules and I did
okay.”
“A gambler and a stock speculator have to play by their rules,
don’t they, J.L.?”
“Yes, it takes long enough to figure them out, doesn’t it?”
“A lifetime, because you never entirely figure them out, like you
never really figure a person out.”
“Ed, how can you figure a person out when you can’t figure
yourself out?”
Bradley laughed. “You’re right there. We live with ourselves
twenty-four hours a day and there’s nothin’ more important to us
than ourselves, and most of us still don’t know about ourselves.”
“And let’s not even bring up the subject of women.”
“No, I’m perplexed enough as it is.” Fresh drinks came and
Bradley held up his glass. They clinked in a toast. “Here’s to never
understanding women. The mystery is too much fun. And here’s
to some good luck in that department once in a while.”
“Cheers,” Livermore responded.
They sat in a comfortable silence for a few moments. Livermore
broke it. “Ed, I can say with no flattery that you are one of the
greatest gamblers in the world. You have played all over the coun-
try, and you consistently win. I have a question for you.”
“Shoot.”
“What do you think it takes to win in the stock market?”

“I asked you that same question a while back, J.L. Besides, what
would I know about the stock market?”
“Please, Ed.” Livermore took a sip of his drink. “I know you
won in a big way in the commodities market in Chicago, years
ago.”
“All right, I’ll try to answer you, J.L.” Bradley paused for a
moment, then answered. “I think it takes three things. Timing.
When to get in the market and when to get out, or when to hold
and when to fold. It takes money management. You can’t ever lose
your stake, or the entire game is over. And it takes emotional sta-
bility. Yes; maybe most important, it takes the ability to control
your emotions when you’re in the play. That’s it.”
“Sounds like the principles of a good gambler.”
“Life’s a gamble, J.L.”
Livermore smiled, and this time he held up his glass. “How
about a toast to people who live by their wits?”
“Who live by their wits and know when to call it quits.” They
clinked glasses. “I like that, J.L. Yes sir, I like that.”
Timing was everything to a speculator. It was never if a stock was
going to move;it was whena stock was going to move up or down.
The crash of 1929 solidified Livermore’s belief in what he called
pivotal points. Black Tuesday was the biggest pivotal point in the
history of the stock market—the market fell 11.7 percent in one
day. Livermore formed the core of his timing strategy based on
pivotal points.
He attempted to explain the concept to his sons when they were
older. “Boys, pivotal points became one of my true trading keys, a
trading technique that was basically unknown in a formal way in
stock speculation in the 1920s and early 1930s. Pivotal points are a
timing device I use to get in and out of the market.
“I divide pivotal points into two categories: The first I call a

reversal pivotal points and the second I call the continuation pivotal
points.
“The reversal pivotal point is not easily defined. In my mind, it
is a change in basic market direction, the perfect psychological
time at the beginning of a new move, a change in the basic trend.
For my style of trading, it did not matter if it was at the bottom or
the top of a long-term trending move. The essential thing to
understand about this technique is that the reversal pivotal point
marks a definite change in direction. The continuation pivotal
point only confirms the move.
“The reversal pivotal point flags for me the optimum trading
time. Reversal pivotal points are almost always accompanied by a
heavy increase in volume, a climax of buying, which is met with a
barrage of selling, or vice versa. This battle, this war between buy-
ers and sellers, causes the stock to reverse its direction, to top out,
or to bottom out in a decline. It is the start of a new direction in
trend for the stock. These confirming volume spurts often end the
day with a 100 to 500 percent increase in the average daily volume.
“I have noticed that these reversal pivotal points usually come
after long-term trending moves. This is one of the reasons why I
always felt that patience was so necessary for success in catching the
big moves.
“You definitely need patience to be sure that you have identified
the reversal pivotal point of a stock. I developed tests. First of all, I
would send out a probe—I would buy a small percentage of the
position I would eventually establish if I were correct with the first
trade. I also checked the entire industry group, or at least one other
stock in the group, to see if it had the same pattern. This was all
the confirmation I needed.
“The second very important type of pivotal point, the contin-
uation pivotal point, usually occurs during a trending move as a
natural reaction for a stock in a definite trend. This is a potential

additional entry point in an ongoing move, or a chance to increase
your position, providing the stock emerges from the continuation
pivot point headed in the same direction as it was before the cor-
rection.*
“For me, a stock’s price is never too high to buy, or too low to sell
short. By waiting for continuation pivotal point signals, I gained the
opportunity to either open a new position or add to a current posi-
tion, if I had already established one. I don’t chase a stock if it gets

oil drilling and service company. The first, in late 1997, led to a decline in price,
and the second, at the end of 1998, led to an increase in price. The company
also formed a continuation pivotal point in mid-1998 when it hit $86, con-
firming the descent—in this case, to $40 near the end of 1998.

away from me. I would rather wait and pay more after the stock has
regrouped and formed a new continuation pivotal point, because
this continuation pivotal point is a confirmation and provides insur-
ance that the stock will most likely continue with its move.
“I also used this pivotal point theory to find many successful
short-selling plays. I looked for stocks that had traded down to a
new low for the past year or so. If they formed a false pivotal
point—that is, if they rallied from this new low and then
dropped down through the new low—they would most likely
continue down from there and establish additional new lows for
the move.
“By correctly catching the pivotal points, I could make my initial
purchase at the right price from the beginning of the move. This
insured that I was never in a loss position and could therefore ride
out the normal stock fluctuations without risking my own capital.
Once the stock had moved off the pivotal point and I was in profit,
I was risking only my paper profits, not my precious capital.
“My early years of getting crushed because I had bought the
stock at the wrong time in its move gave me the clues to develop
this new theory of pivotal points. If you buy before the pivotal
point is established then you may be too early. This is dangerous,
because the stock may never form a proper pivotal point to clearly
establish its direction. If you buy more than 5 or 10 percent above
the initial pivotal point then you are too late. You may have lost
your edge, because the move is already under way.
“The pivotal point gives the only tip-off you need to trade and
win. A speculator has to be patient, because it takes time for a
stock to run out its logical and natural course.
“The key to my later theory of trading is to trade only on the
pivotal points. I have always made money when I was patient and
traded on the pivotal points.

“I also believe that the largest part of a stock movement often
occurs in the last two weeks or so of the play, and that the same
applies for commodities. So, once again, a speculator has to be
patient, get into position and wait, but at the same time must be
completely alert for the clues when they come, good or bad.”
A danger signal, often a signal to exit a trade, a signal that made
Livermore sit up and take notice, was the one-day reversal. This is
a stock movement that often happens at the end of a long-term
move. A one-day reversal occurs when the high of the day is
higher than the high of the previous day, but the close of the day
is below the close of the previous day and the volume of the cur-
rent day is higher than the volume of the previous day.
Figure 11.2 shows an example. All during Schwab’s rise, fol-
lowing the trend, the line of least resistance, it had only normal
reactions. Then it suddenly had an aberrant reaction—a dramatic
rise of over 15 points in three days that developed into a spike.
During the last day of the ascent, the rally broke near the end of
the day, and the price of the stock fell, closing near the low of the
day. The next morning, it opened and fell further. These one-day
reversals are often accompanied by increased volume. This sce-
nario was a screaming danger signal to Livermore.
Livermore believed that if a trader had the patience to sit with
the stock all during its rise, after the one-day reversal the trader
must have the courage to do the right thing, acknowledge this
danger signal, and consider selling the stock. Livermore firmly
believed in patience and courage.
The pivotal point theory allowed Livermore the chance to buy
at the exact right time. He never wanted to buy at the lowest price
or sell at the top. He wanted to buy at the right time and sell at the
right time.

This required patience to wait for the perfect trading moment
to form. He did not care if the right formation did not occur on a
particular stock he was following, because the pattern would
appear on another stock sooner or later. Patience, patience,
patience—that was his key to timing success.
Livermore always considered time as a real and essential trading
element. He often would say it’s not the thinking that makes the
money—it’s the sitting and waiting that makes the money.
This has been incorrectly interpreted by many people to mean
that Livermore would buy a stock and then sit and wait for it to
move. This is not so. There were many occasions where Livermore
sat and waited in cash, holding little or no stock, until the right
situation appeared. He was able to sit and wait patiently in cash
until the perfect situation presented itself to him. When these

conditions came together, when as many of the odds as possible
were in his favor, then and only then would he strike.
Buying on the pivotal point assured him the best chance of
coming into the situation, just as the action was about to begin.
And once he was sure of his play, he was not afraid to make his
commitment. He was not called the Boy Plunger for nothing.
His decision was always clear, as he wrote in his own book, pub-
lished in 1940, How to Trade in Stocks:
When a speculator can determine the Pivotal Point of a stock
and interpret the action at that point, he may make a commit-
ment with the positive assurance of being right from the start.
But bear in mind when using Pivotal Points in anticipating
movements, that if the stock does not perform as it should,
after crossing the Pivotal Point, this is an important danger
signal which must be heeded.
I have found the study of Pivotal Points fascinating almost
beyond belief. You will find a golden field for personal
research. You will derive a singular pleasure and satisfaction
from successful trades based on your own judgment. You will
discover that profits made in this way are immensely more
gratifying than any which could possibly come from tips, or
the guidance of someone else. If you make your own discov-
ery, trade your own way, exercise patience, and watch for the
danger signals, you will develop a proper trend of thinking.
Every time I lost patience and failed to await the Pivotal
Points and fiddled around for some easy profits, I would lose
money.
Livermore knew that this pivotal point theory applied to trading in
commodities, as well. While he did not consider this method fool-
proof, it was a core part of his trading strategy.

He also stated that there was probably a lot more to perfecting
the use of pivotal points in the future. He was sure people would
develop better trading methods from his basic premise. He prom-
ised that he would not be jealous of their success.
Livermore said that it was okay to anticipate the action of the
market or a stock, but that traders should not take action until the
market has confirmed that their judgment is correct by its action.
Then, and only then, should they move with their money.
Pivotal points were an essential confirming signal for Livermore.
He explained further to his sons that the market will often go con-
trary to what speculators have predicted. At these times, successful
speculators must abandon their predictions and follow the action
of the market. Prudent speculators never argue with the tape.
Markets are never wrong, but opinions often are.
New highs were always good news for Livermore. To him, they
meant that the stock had pushed through the overhead resistance
and was very likely to advance. Livermore was not a chartist. He
calculated everything from a numerical base.
Figures 11.3 and 11.4 show several new-high breakout forma-
tions like those that appeared to Livermore on a regular basis. Liver-
more worked with them in numerical form, but charts have been
used here for expediency. Figure 11.3 shows that Best Buy, a con-
sumer retailer ofelectronics, appliances, and entertainment software,
broke out ofa long consolidation at $30 in December 1998 and kept
right on climbing to new highs. Figure 11.4 shows that Nortel Net-
works, a manufacturer of telecommunication equipment, formed a
strong reversal pivotal point at $30 in September 1998 and powered
through to a new all-time high of $65 in April 1999.
Why these formations repeat themselves is basically unknown.
Livermore explained it as human nature in his own book, How to

Trade in Stocks: “All through time, people have basically acted the
same way in the market as a result of greed, fear, ignorance, and
hope. That is why the numerical formations and patterns recur on
a constant basis.”
For his overall market and industry-group timing cues, Liver-
more was always very sensitive to the market leaders. He tracked
them carefully, watching them like a hawk through the glass pan-
els of his office as they were posted on the green chalkboard.
Tracking the leaders provided strong timing clues for the general
overall direction of the market. Trading several stocks in each of
the major leading groups also helped confirm when a specific
industry group was falling out of favor and reversing—or, vice
versa, coming into favor.

The leaders, in Livermore’s mind, were also surrogates for the
Dow Jones averages. When these leading groups faltered, it was a
warning signal, and his attention to the overall direction of the
market was heightened. The signal occurred when the leaders
stopped making new highs and stalled, often reversing direction
before the overall market turned.
This was one of the essential timing clues for Livermore in the
1907 and 1929 crashes. The leaders faltered and began to turn as
the craze for secondary stocks in the overall market broadened. Of
course, the wild speculation in these ancillary issues spoke volumes
to Livermore, because he had been through crashes before.
Livermore developed a sophisticated system of following the
current leaders. His interest in them was twofold. First, they were

8467_Smitten_11_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:34 PM Page 219

the only stocks he would speculate in. He wrote in How to Trade in
Stocks:
Confine your studies of stock market movements to the
prominent issues of the day, the leaders. It is where the ac-
tion is. If you cannot make money out of the leading active
issues, you are not going to make money out of the stock
market.
Second, this will also keep your trading universe small and
controllable, so you can focus and trade the stocks with the
greatest potential. Don’t let greed drive your moves by trying
to catch the exact top and the exact bottom.
Livermore also believed that timing should never be dictated by
high prices. High prices were never a timing signal to sell a stock.
He often said that just because a stock was selling at a high price
did not mean it would not go higher.
Livermore was also just as comfortable on the short side, if that
was the direction of the trend—just because a stock had fallen in
price did not mean that it would not go lower. He never bought
stocks on declines, and he never shorted stocks on rallies.
Buying stocks as they made new highs and selling short as they
made new lows was a contrarian point of view, and this has
remained a contrarian point of view with many investors through
history.
Livermore let the market tell him what to do, he got his clues
and his cues from what the market told him. He did not anticipate,
he followed the message he received from the tape. Some stocks
keep making new highs and can be held for a very long time, as
shown in Figure 11.5. Cisco Systems, a leader in networking solu-
tions for the Internet, had basically gone up for five straight years.

1,000 shares in 1994 would have cost $2,000; five years later, in
1999, that investment would be worth $70,000.
Livermore told his son Paul, “Every stock is like a human being:
it has a personality, a distinctive personality. Aggressive, reserved,
hyper, high-strung, volatile, boring, direct, logical, predictable,
unpredictable. I often studied stocks like I would study people;
after a while their reactions to certain circumstances become more
predictable.
“I am not the first to observe this. I know people who have
made a lot of money in the stock market by analyzing the person-
ality of a stock, and following that personality, reacting to it by
buying and selling it according to its personality traits. But beware,
not often, but sometimes, personalities change.

“I firmly believe that as long as a stock is acting properly, pro-
gressing with normal reactions such as consolidations and correc-
tions, and proceeding in the direction of the trend, there is
nothing to fear, no reason for a speculator to be concerned. And
the fact that a stock is selling in new high territory should only
encourage the speculator.
“On the other hand, a speculator must never become so com-
placent or relaxed as to miss the clues that the stock has ‘topped
out’ and is creating a pivotal point that will set it off in a new direc-
tion, perhaps a reversal in trend. My motto son, is:‘Be ever vigi-
lant for the danger signs.’”
Livermore traded to beat the game, and a big part was having
the right timing. His quest was never-ending. His theories of piv-
otal points, his approach to new highs, his industry leaders and
industry-group theories, were all new at the time, and they remain
controversial. But it was the mental challenge they presented that
was his passion.
But like anyone else, Livermore also liked what the money
could do. Having money was fun.
It was 1931, and Paul Livermore was about to turn 8 years old. As
a surprise, his parents decided to bring the Barnum and Bailey
Circus to the 13-acre grounds at Evermore.
Tents were built during the night, and bleachers were erected.
Trucks brought in the elephants and other animals during the
night. At dawn the performers arrived, 100 clowns, the trapeze
artists, the lion tamers, the Big Top master ofceremonies, the tum-
blers, the horse trainers, and the high-wire act. The neighbors
started to arrive at 10 A.M. When Paul awoke, the entire grounds
had been transformed into a major performing circus.
He walked the grounds wide-eyed in amazement. The
overnight transformation had changed his private and solitary

playground into a land of clowns, funny cars, elephants, lions,
tigers, monkeys, trapeze artists, beautiful horses with magic riders,
and huge striped tents with people hustling and bustling every-
where. He held onto his parents’ hands as they strolled the grounds.
The performance began at noon. The guest cars lined the drive-
way, all the way out onto the road. The chauffeur was transporting
people in Livermore’s three-seat electric car, which he and the
boys usually used to roam the estate.
The circus went on all afternoon, and there was a big party in
the Livermore house when it was done, with a giant 6-foot birth-
day cake and food and drink for everyone. It was emblazoned for-
ever in Paul’s mind. It was his biggest day.
Later, when he got older, he thought that his parents might have
felt guilty for all the attention they lavished on his brother, Jesse,
who was openly the favorite of both his parents. He knew this
from a very early age and was able to cope with it, happy in his
own world.
Neither of the boys saw much of their parents. They went to
boarding school in the winter, camping in the summer. When
they were young, they always had their own individual nannies,
who were later replaced by maids, chauffeurs, private detectives,
and the imposing, protective presence of Harry Edgar Dache, their
favorite, who sometimes tutored them in math, languages, and life.
The servants all spoke French. Mousie thought it gave them
culture to speak French in the house. Both Jesse and Paul could
speak French. Paul was the best. He spoke perfect French. Their
father never even tried;he stuck to English.
He was too busy with the market.

ONE AFTERNOON AT BRADLEY’S BEACH CLUB IN PALM
Beach, Livermore sat around a table in the gaming room playing
high-stakes bridge with Walter Chrysler; Ed Kelley, the head of
United Fruit;and T. Coleman Du Pont. They took a break from
their game to enjoy a lobster lunch, a specialty at Bradley’s.
The Florida lobster is different from the Maine lobster. It is
really more like a giant crawfish than a true lobster. It was Bradley
who introduced this crustacean to the palates of the American
rich. The lobster salad was famous—large pieces of lobster on a
bed of greens, covered with a mustard sauce whose exact compo-
nents were the chef’s most prized secret. The bridge players all
ordered the same thing, with two bottles of vintage Rogert cham-
pagne. Green turtle soup, another specialty of the house at $1 per
cup (a very high price for soup at the time), preceded the salad.
“You hear what happened last year with these lobsters?”
Chrysler asked.
“What?” Kelley replied.
“Bradley liked them so much he said he would take the whole
Bahamian crop. He didn’t know that it could be as high as 10,000
lobsters. The Bahamians went nuts and were going to fish the hell
out of them, because they had a firm order to buy them all from
some crazy American.”
Chrysler paused as the green turtle soup was served from a large
silver tureen.
“So?” Du Pont asked.
“So when Bradley realized he had made a giant blunder, he told
them he would still go through with the purchase anyway—you
know how he is about honoring a commitment—although he had
no idea what the hell he would do with that many lobsters.”
“Don’t tell me that he sold them to Flagler and had them
shipped to New York and made a fortune,” Livermore said.

“No, the hurricane last year wiped out the Bahamas and the
lobster fishing, so he skated out of the whole problem,” Chrysler
replied.
“What luck!” Kelley said with a smile. “He’s got lucky horse-
shoes hidden somewhere.”
They all laughed.
“Just like you, J.L., in your latest wheat trade. I’ve been hearing
rumors on the Street about you. Tell us about it, entertain us at
lunch.”
“Nothing entertaining to tell. I just felt the demand for wheat
in America was underestimated and the price was going to rise. I
waited for what I call my pivotal point and stepped in and bought
five million bushels of wheat, about seven million dollars worth.
“I watched the market closely after the purchase. It lagged. It
was a dull market, but it never declined below where I bought it.
Then one morning the market started upward, and after a few days
the rise consolidated, forming another of my pivotal points. It lay
around in there for a little while, and then one day it popped out
on the upside with heavy volume.
“A good signal, so I put in an order for another five million
bushels. This order was filled at higher and higher prices. This was
good news to me, because it clearly indicated that the market line
of least resistance was upwards.
“I liked the fact that it was much more difficult to acquire the
second lot of five million bushels. I then had filled out my prede-
termined target position of ten million bushels, so I stepped back
and kept my eye on the market. It formed a strong bull market and
rose steadily for several months.
“When wheat rose 25 cents above my average price, I cashed in.
This was a bad mistake.” Livermore paused as the lobster salads
were served and the second bottle of champagne was opened.

“J. L., how the hell could it be a bad mistake to make a profit of
two and a half million dollars?” asked Chrysler.
“Because Walter, I sat back and watched wheat rise another 20
cents in price in three days.”
“I still don’t get it,” Chrysler said.
“Why was I afraid? There was no good reason to sell the wheat.
I simply wanted to take my profit.”
“It still looks like a pretty good trade to me. I’m afraid you lost
me, J.L.,” Kelley added.
“All right, let me explain myself better. You remember that old
joke about the guy who goes to the race track and bets on the daily
double and wins, then takes all his winnings and bets it on the third
race and wins. He does the same on all the other races, and wins.
Then, on the eighth and final race, he takes his hundred thousand
dollars in winnings and bets it all to win on a horse, and the horse
loses.”
“Yeah.” Chrysler nodded.
“Well, he’s walking out of the track and he meets a pal of his,
who says, ‘How’d you do today?’
“‘Not bad,’ he answers, smiling. ‘I lost two bucks.’”
They laughed. “That’s a good story, J.L., but how does it apply
to you and wheat?” Chrysler asked.
“Simple. Why was I afraid of losing the track’s money? When I
sold, I was simply acting out of fear. I was in too big a hurry to
convert a paper profit into a cash profit. I had no other reason for
selling out that wheat, except that I was afraid to lose the profit I
had made.”
“What’s wrong with being afraid? These days it seems like the
safest bet,” Du Pont commented.
“So what did you do, J.L.?” Kelley asked.
“After I booked my profit in the wheat, I realized I had made a

great mistake. I had not had the courage to play the deal out to the
end until I got a signal to sell, a real definitive sell signal.”
“So?”
“I reentered the market and went back at an average price 25
cents higher than where I had sold out my original position. It rose
another 30 cents, and then it gave a danger signal, a real strong
danger signal. I sold out near the high of $2.06 a bushel. About a
week later, it sold at $1.77 a bushel.”
“Well, you have more guts than me, J.L., and it sounds a little
like greed to me.”
“That’s because you sell fruit, Ed. The way you know how to
diagnose the market on fruit is the way I am supposed to know how
to diagnose the stock and commodities markets, and the wheat
futures market had shown no signs of weakness when I first sold it.
“The next time I sold the wheat it was different;I could see def-
inite symptoms of weakness. It gave the clues, the hints, the telltale
signs of topping out. The tape always gives plenty of warning time
for the savvy speculator to heed.”
“J.L., I like your story, but sometimes I think maybe you got a
set of those lucky horseshoes too, just like Bradley,” Chrysler
added.
“Walter, a little luck never hurt anyone,” Livermore paused and
looked around at the group. “I’d say we all had our share of luck at
one time or another.”
They all laughed.
Money management was one of the three pieces of the financial
puzzle that fascinated Livermore:timing, money management, and
emotional control. Livermore had five main rules in managing his
money. He attempted over the years to explain his entire trading
theory to his sons, money management was a big part of it.

One day he called his two sons into the library at Evermore. He
sat behind the massive desk;the two boys sat down in front of him.
He leaned forward and took a wad of cash out of his pocket. He
peeled off 10 $1 bills. He did this twice, then folded the bills and
handed each boy a pack of 10 ones.
The boys sat looking at him, each holding their money. “Boys,
always carry your money folded and in your left pocket. Go ahead,
do it. You can keep the money.”
The boys did as they were told and put the folded money in
their left pockets. “You see, pickpockets always go for a person’s
wallet, usually in their back pocket. Or they will come up behind
you and go for your right front pocket, because most people are
right-handed. You all right with this so far, boys?” he asked.
The boys nodded.
He continued, “All right, that’s why you keep your paper
money folded in your left pocket. See, if a pickpocket gets into
your left pocket, and he gets that close to your balls, you’re going
to know about it.”
The boys looked at each other.
Their father continued, “Don’t ever lose your cash, boys. That’s
the moral of this story. Keep it close to your balls, and don’t let
anyone near it.”
Livermore had several other money-management tips.
Rule 1:Don’t lose money.
Don’t lose your stake. A speculator without cash is like a store-
owner with no inventory. Cash is your inventory, your lifeline, and
your best friend. Without cash, you are out of business. Don’t lose
your line.
“It is wrong and dangerous to establish your full stock position
at only one price. Rather, you must first decide how many shares
you want to trade. For example, if you want to purchase 1,000



==================================================
                     PAGE 244

LIVERMORE’S MONEY-MANAGEMENT RULES • 229 •
shares as the full final position, do it like this:“Start with a 200-
share purchase on the pivot point. If the price goes up, then buy
an additional 200 shares, still within the pivot point range. If it
keeps rising, buy another 200 shares. See how it reacts;if it keeps
on rising or corrects and then rises, you can go ahead and purchase
the final 400 shares.
“It is very important to note that each additional purchase must
be at a higher price. The same rules, of course, would apply to sell-
ing short, only each short sale would be at a lower price than the
preceding sale.
“The basic logic is simple and concise:Each trade, as it is estab-
lished toward the total 1,000-share position, must always show the
speculator a profit. The fact that each trade shows a profit is living
proof, hard evidence, that your basic judgment was correct in
making the trade. It is all the proof you need. Conversely, if you
lose money, you know immediately that your judgment was
wrong.
“The tough part for the inexperienced speculator is paying
more for each position. Why? Because everyone wants a bargain.
The psychological battle is not to fight the facts, not to hope, not
to argue with the tape, for the tape is always correct. There is no
place in speculating for hoping, for guessing, for fear, for greed, for
emotions. The tape tells the truth, but often there is a lie buried in
the human interpretation.
“Finally, the speculator may choose a different ratio of purchas-
ing the stock than I use. You could, for instance, purchase 30 per-
cent as the first position, 30 as the second, and 40 for the final
purchase. It is up to individual speculators to decide the ratio that
works best for them. I have simply outlined what works best for
me. The main rule is, do not take your entire position all at once;
wait for confirmation of your judgment. Pay more for each lot you
buy. This goes against most traders’ natural instincts.

“And remember to establish in your mind the total amount of
shares you want to purchase before you begin the trade.”
Rule 2:Always establish a stop.
“Just as you should decide the number of shares you want to
buy, what percentage of your portfolio you will invest in any play,
and your general upside price target, you should always have a
clear price at which to sell if the stock moves against you.
“And you must obey your rules, no cheating by waiting! My
basic rule was never to take a capital loss of more than 10 percent.
Losses are twice as expensive to make up. “I learned this in the
bucket shops, where I worked with 10 percent margin. I was auto-
matically sold out if the loss exceeded the 10 percent limit. The 10
percent loss rule became my most important rule for managing
money. It is also a key timing rule.
“Remember, a successful speculator must set a firm stop before
making a trade and must never sustain a loss of more than 10 per-
cent of invested capital. If you lose 50 percent, you must make 100
percent to get even.*
“I have also learned that when your broker calls you and tells
you he needs more money for a margin requirement on a stock
that is declining, tell him to sell out his position. When you buy a
stock at fifty and it goes to forty-five, do not buy more in order to
average out your price. The stock has not done what you pre-
dicted; that is enough of an indication that your judgment was
wrong. Take your losses quickly and get out.
“Remember, never meet a margin call, and never average losses.
“Many times I would close out a position before suffering a 10
percent loss. I did this simply because the stock was not acting
right from the start. Often my instincts would whisper to me:
‘J.L., this stock has a malaise, it is a lagging dullard. It just does

not feel right,’ and I would sell out my position in the blink of
an eye.
“Perhaps this was my inner mind working, distilling things I had
seen thousands of times before and sending subconscious signals,
registering repeated patterns that were stored in my memory and
then subliminally remembered. Whatever it was, I have learned
over the years, through many market experiences, to trust these
instincts.
“I absolutely believe that price movement patterns are repeated
and appear over and over, with slight variations. This is because
humans drive the stocks, and human nature never changes.
“I have observed many times that people often become involun-
tary investors. They buy a stock that goes down, and they refuse to
sell and take their losses. They prefer to hold onto the stock and
hope that it will rally eventually and climb back up. This is why the
10 percent rule is essential. Don’t ever become an involuntary
investor. Take your losses quickly. Easy to say, but hard to do.”

“The successful speculator must always have cash in reserve, like a
good general who keeps troops in reserve for exactly the right

moment and then moves with great conviction, committing the
reserves for final victory after waiting until all the odds are favorable.
“There is a never-ending stream of opportunities in the stock
market and, if you miss a good opportunity, wait a little while, be
patient, and another one will come along. Don’t reach for a trade,
all the conditions for a good trade must be on your side. Remem-
ber, you do not have to be in the market all the time.”
Livermore used the analogy of playing cards—in his case, gin,
poker, and bridge—where it is only human nature to want to play
every hand. This desire to always be in the game is one of the spec-
ulator’s greatest hazards, and eventually will bring about disaster, as
it did to Livermore several times in his early career.
“When playing the stock market, there are times when your
money should be waiting on the sidelines in cash, waiting to come
into play. Time is not money—time is time, and money is money.
“Often money that is just sitting can later be moved into the
right situation at the right time and make a fast fortune. Patience is
the key to success, not speed. Time is a cunning speculator’s best
friend if it is used wisely.
“Remember, the clever speculator is always patient and always
has a reserve of cash.”
Rule 4:Let the position ride.
“As long as the stock is behaving normally, do not be in a hurry
to take a profit. You must know you are right in your basic judg-
ment, or you would have no profit at all. If there is nothing basi-
cally negative, then let it ride. It may grow into a very large profit.
As long as the action of the overall market and the stock do not
give you cause to worry, have the courage of your convictions, and
stay with it.
“When I was in profit on a trade, I was never nervous. I could
have a line of 100,000 shares out on a single stock play and sleep

like a baby. Why? Because I was in profit on that trade. I was sim-
ply ‘using the house’s money’—that is, using the stock market’s
money. If I lost all that profit—well, then I simply lost money I
never had in the first place.
“Of course, the opposite is true as well. If I bought a stock and
it went against me I would sell it immediately. You can’t stop and
try to figure out why a stock is going in the wrong direction.
The fact is that it is going in the wrong direction, and that is
enough evidence for an experienced speculator to close the
trade.
“Profits take care of themselves, losses never do.
“Never confuse this approach of letting the position ride with
the buy-and-hold-forever strategy. I do not, and never have, blindly
bought and held a stock. How can anyone know that far into the
future? Things change: Life changes, relationships change, health
changes, seasons change, and people change—why shouldn’t the
basic conditions that caused you to buy a stock change? To buy and
hold blindly on the basis that a stock is in a great company or a
strong industry, or that the economy is generally healthy, is, to me,
the equivalent of stock market suicide.
“Stick with the winners. Let them ride until you have a clear
reason to sell.”
Rule 5:Take the profits in cash.
“I recommend parking fifty percent of the profits from a suc-
cessful trade, especially when the trade doubled the original capi-
tal. Set this money aside, put it in the bank, hold it in reserve, or
lock it up in a safe-deposit box.
“Like winning in the casino, it’s a good idea, now and then, to
take your winnings off the table and turn them into cash. There is
no better time than after a large win on a stock. Cash is the bullet
in the chamber;always keep a cash reserve.

“The single largest regret I have ever had in my financial life was
not paying enough attention to this rule.”
Livermore agreed with his friend Bradley, the gambler. After tim-
ing and money management come emotions. It is one thing to
know what to do;it is quite another thing to have the will to actu-
ally do it. This is true of the stock market. This is true of life. Who
knew better than Livermore?
As he explained to his sons, “I believe that having the discipline
to follow your rules is essential. Without specific, clear, and tested
rules, speculators do not have any real chance of success. Why?
Because speculators without a plan are like a general without a
strategy, and therefore without an actionable battle plan. Specula-
tors without a single clear plan can only act and react, act and
react, to the slings and arrows of stock market misfortune, until
finally they are defeated.
“It is my conclusion that playing the market is partly an art
form;it is not just pure reason. If it were pure reason, then some-
body would have figured it out long ago. That’s why I believe that
all speculators must analyze their own emotions to find out just
what level of stress they can endure. Every speculator is different;
every human psyche is unique; every personality is exclusive to
that one person. Learn your own emotional limits before attempting to
speculate—that is my advice to anyone who has ever asked me what
makes a successful speculator. If you can’t sleep at night because of
your stock market position, then you have gone too far. If this is
the case, then sell your position down to the sleeping level.
“On the other hand, I believe that anyone who is intelligent,
conscientious, and willing to put in the necessary time can be suc-
cessful on Wall Street. As long as they realize the market is a busi-
ness like any other business, they have a good chance to prosper.

“I believe that irresistible forces are at work behind all major
movements in the stock market. This is all the successful specula-
tor needs to know—just be aware of the movements and act upon
that knowledge. It is too difficult to match up world events or cur-
rent events with the movements of the stock market. This is true
because the stock market moves ahead of world events. The stock
market is not operating in the present or reflecting the present, it
is operating on what is yet to be, the future. The market often
moves contrary to apparent common sense and world events, as if
it had a mind of its own. Remember, it is designed to fool most of
the people most of the time. Eventually, the truth of why it moved
as it did will emerge.
“It is therefore foolish to try to anticipate the movement of the
market based on current economic news and current events, such
as the purchasing manager’s report, the balance of payments, the
Consumer Price Index and unemployment figures, or even the
rumor of war, because these are already factored into the market.
“It is not that I ignored these facts or was ignorant of them;I
wasn’t. The truth is that I voraciously read every newspaper I
could get my hands on, and I had done so since my youth. I was
well aware of world events, political events, and economic events.
But these facts were not facts I could use to predict the market.
After the market moved, its movement would be rationalized by
the pundits in endless post mortems. Later when the dust had set-
tled, the real economic, political, and world events would eventu-
ally be brought into focus by historians telling us why the market
acted as it had. But by that time it was too late to make any money.
“Trying to figure out the why of a market move can often cause
great emotional strife. The simple fact is that the market always pre-
cedes economic news, it does not react to economic news. A good
earnings statement is issued by a company, and the stock proceeds

to fall in price. Why? Because the market has already factored in
those earnings.
“One of the problems with looking too deeply into economic
news is that it may plant suggestions in your mind, and suggestions
can be dangerous to your emotional stock market health.
“I once proved this in a golf game with my old friend Ed Kel-
ley, head of United Fruit. We were playing in a threesome with
Walter Chrysler on the Lake Placid golf course behind my home
one weekend. We always played for between one and two hundred
dollars a hole.
“Kelley was the better golfer, a scratch handicap. On the fif-
teenth hole, I said to Kelley, ‘Ed, you’re by far the best golfer in
our group. Have you ever thought about that big boulder on the
left side of the fairway on seventeen?’
“He answered, ‘Why would I think about that, J.L.? I’ve never
come near it. It’s you that always hits that, isn’t it?’
“‘I’ve hit it a few times, yes, but I think today is your day to hit
it, Ed.’
“‘Please, J.L.,’ he laughed.
“‘No, Ed, suppose you hit it and your ball goes flying off into
the lake.’
“‘Impossible. Then I’d look like you,’ he said.
“We played on for a hole with no mention of the boulder. As
we teed up on the seventeenth, I said ‘You know I’m famous for
my hunches, Ed, and I’ve got a feeling, a hunch, you’re going to
hit that boulder today. In fact, I want to make a wager that you do.’
“‘J.L., don’t throw your money away, no matter how easy it is
for you to make it. What do you want to bet, a hundred?’ Kelley
said.
“‘No, Ed, let’s make it three hundred. Off the boulder and into
the lake.’
“‘It’s your funeral, J.L.,’ Kelley said.

“‘Maybe it is my funeral, just don’t you forget to miss that
boulder.’ I smiled and stepped back. Ed addressed the ball and took
a mighty swing. The ball arched up like a rainbow and descended
directly onto the rock, careening off like a demented pool ball
directly into the lake.
“‘J.L. you jinxed me!’ Kelley yelled. ‘You made me do that. I
never came close to that boulder in my life!’
“‘No Ed, it wasn’t me,’ I answered. ‘It was the power of sug-
gestion, the power of the subconscious mind, that made you do
that. I know you’re good at your business, Ed, but be careful if you
ever try to play the market. You get that all the time in the market,
the power of suggestion infiltrating the subconscious. Believe me,
Ed, I’m an expert. I’ve been broke enough times, haven’t I?’
“‘J.L., I’m speechless.’
“‘Ed, just thank me for the cheap lesson today.’
“‘J.L., I have no intention of playing the market. So I don’t
think I’ll thank you for that cheap three-hundred-dollar lesson,’
Kelley said. We all laughed.”
Livermore told his sons that he never understood why people
thought making money in the market was easy. “We all have our
own businesses. I would never ask Kelley to tell me the secrets of
the fruit business or Chrysler those of the automotive business. It
just would never dawn on me. So I can never understand when
people ask me how they could make some fast money in the stock
market.
“I always smile and say to myself, ‘How could I possibly know
how you could make money in the market?’ I always evade the
question; it’s like asking me, how someone could make some
quick money performing brain surgery or defending some person
in a murder case. I believe, from experience, that even attempting
to answer these questions would affect a person’s emotions because

they would have to take a firm position and defend their thoughts,
which could change the next day, depending on the conditions of
the market.
“But I have always fully understood that I am not the only one
who knows that the stock market is the world’s biggest gold mine,
sitting at the foot of the island of Manhattan. A gold mine that
opens its doors every day and invites anyone and everyone in to
plumb its depths and leave with wheelbarrows full of gold bars, if
they can—and I have done it. The gold mine is there all right, and
every day somebody plumbs its depths, and when the bell rings at
the end of the day they have gone from pauper to prince, or gone
from prince to supreme potentate, or gone stony broke. And it’s
always there, waiting.
“I believe that uncontrolled basic emotions are the true and
deadly enemy of the speculator; that hope, fear, and greed are
always present, sitting on the edge of the psyche, waiting on the
sidelines, waiting to jump into the action, plow into the game.”
He told his sons this was one of the reasons he never used the
words bullish or bearish. These words are not in my vocabulary
because I believe they can create an emotional mind-set of a spe-
cific market direction in a speculator’s mind. The words bull and
bear cause a trader to get a fixed mind-set. And there is a good
chance the speculator will blindly follow that trend or direction for
an extended period of time, even if the facts change.
“I have found that well-defined trends do not last for extended
periods of time. When people ask me for a tip, I say the market is
currently in an upward, downward, or sideways trend. Or I tell
them that the line of least resistance is currently up or down, as the
case may be, and that is all I say.
“This leaves me with the flexibility to change my mind, accord-
ing to market behavior. I never try to predict or anticipate the

market. I only try to react to what the market is telling me by its
behavior.
“I firmly believe that there are always clues as to what is going
to come next. The clues are buried in the behavior of the mar-
ket—what the market actually does, the here and now—not what
is predicted that it will do. In a way, you have to be like a detective
and solve the puzzle using the facts that are given. But, like a good
detective, a trader should always look for proof of those facts and
reconfirm them if possible. This requires an unemotional analysis.
“And I am one of the few speculators who has never cared in
which direction a stock was going. I simply go with the line of
least resistance. For me it is simply a market play;the direction of
the stock is not important. In fact, one of the reasons I was noted
as the Great Bear of Wall Street was that so few other speculators
had the courage of their convictions to play the downside, the
negative side of the market.
“When stocks decline swiftly and abruptly, they are being
driven by fear. When they rise, they are being driven by hope. If
people are hoping a stock will rise, they are slower to sell. If they
fear the stock will decline, they are usually quick to dump that
stock. This is why declines produce faster, more abrupt market
action. So traders who play the short side must react to faster, more
drastic market patterns and conditions.
“I believe there are no good stocks or bad stocks;there are only
money-makingstocks. So there is no good direction to trade, short or
long;there is only the money-making way to trade. I have observed
that to sell short goes against human nature, which is basically opti-
mistic. And I believe that fewer than 5 percent of speculators trade
the short side. There is also no question that it is extremely danger-
ous to sell short, because the potential loss is unlimited. It takes
strong control of your emotions to trade on the short side.

“I observed early on that the stock market moves up roughly a
third of the time, sideways a third of the time, and downward a
third of the time. Therefore, if you only play the bull side of the
market you are out of the action two-thirds of the time, waiting,
hoping, and wondering. For good or bad, I was never one who
wanted to wait and hope and wonder. I wanted to play the game
and win more times than I lost.
“I am fully aware that of the millions of people who will spec-
ulate in the stock market, few will spend their full time involved in
the art of speculation. Yet, as far as I am concerned, it is a full-time
job, perhaps even more than a job, perhaps a vocation, to which
many are called and few are singled out for success.
“By far the hardest emotional battle for a speculator is dealing
with tips. The main reason I moved uptown to Fifth Avenue was
to get out of the reach of everyone who was trying to help me by
giving me ‘sure things’ and ‘inside information.’ Beware of alltips!
“Tips come from all sources. One such tip was passed to me by
the chairman of a major American corporation at a dinner party at
my house in Great Neck.
“‘How are things going?’ I asked him.
“‘Great. We’ve turned the company around—not that it was
really in trouble, but it looks like clear sailing from here. In fact,
our quarterly earnings are coming out in a week, and they are
going to be terrific.’
“I liked him and believed him, so the next morning I bought a
thousand shares to test it out. The earnings came in just as the chief
executive had said they would. The stock rose nicely, the earnings
continued to rise for the next three quarters, and the stock rose
steadily. I was lulled into a feeling of security as the stock contin-
ued to rise. Then it stopped and started plummeting in the oppo-
site direction, like a waterfall.

“I called the chairman and said, ‘This fall in your stock price has
me worried. What’s going on?’
“He answered, ‘I know the price has fallen J.L., but we consider
it nothing more than a natural correction. After all, we have had a
pretty damn steady rise in the price of the stock for almost a year
now.’
“‘How’s business?’ I asked.
“‘Well, our sales are slightly off, and that news may have leaked
out, I’m afraid. Looks like the bears got hold of that information
and are hammering the stock. It’s mostly short selling, a bear raid,
we think. We’ll drive them out on the next rally, squeeze them a
little, eh J.L.?’
“‘Are you selling any of your holdings?’ I asked.
“‘Absolutely not! Where would I put my money with more
safety than my own company?’
“Sure enough, I later found out that the insiders were busy sell-
ing into the stock’s strength the minute they got wind of the busi-
ness going into a slump. On the bad news, known only to them,
they were dumping as much stock as the market would take.
“I never got mad. It was my stupidity and greed. I knew that all
key executives were basically cheerleaders and that they must
remain positive, must be bearers of only good news. They could
never tell shareholders or competitors that things were not as rosy
as they appeared. In fact, it always made me smile to listen to their
mendacity. The misstatements, the lies, were just a matter of self-
preservation, an essential part of the job of a chief executive offi-
cer at every level of power.
“But it was my self-preservation I was interested in, not that of
the top executives and shareholders of the companies I invested in.
Therefore, after a while—and some substantial lost money—I
never asked insiders about how their businesses were doing.

“Why waste my time listening to half-truths, shadowy state-
ments, inaccurate projections, and just plain bold-faced lies? I
could just look at the behavior of the stock. The story was clear
in its action. The truth was in the tape for anyone and everyone
to see.
“I have suggested to people who are interested in the stock mar-
ket that they carry around a small notebook, keep notes on inter-
esting general market information, and perhaps develop their own
stock market trading strategy. I always suggest that the first thing
they write down in their little notebooks should be: ‘Beware of
inside information—all inside information!’
“There is only one way to achieve success in speculation—
through hard work, persistently hard work. If there is any easy
money lying around, no one is going to try to give it to me, this I
know. My satisfaction always came from beating the market, solv-
ing the puzzle. The money was the reward, but it was not the main
reason I loved the market. The stock market is the greatest, most
complex puzzle ever invented—and it pays the biggest jackpot.
“Always remember;you can win a horse race, but you can’t beat
the races. You can win on a stock, but you cannot beat Wall Street
all the time. Nobody can.
“People always talked about my instincts, especially after the
Union Pacific story and the San Francisco earthquake. But I never
thought my instincts were that special. The instincts of a seasoned
speculator are really no different from the instincts of a farmer like
my father. In fact, I consider farmers to be the biggest gamblers in
the world. Planting their crops every year, gambling on the price
of wheat, corn, cotton, or soybeans. Choosing the right crop to
plant, gambling on the weather and insects, the unpredictable
demand for the crop—what could be more speculative? These
same principles apply to all businesses. So, after twenty, thirty, or

forty years of growing wheat or corn, raising cattle, or making
automobiles or bicycles, a person naturally develops a sixth sense,
an intuition, experienced-based hunches about the business. I
consider myself no different.
“The only way I may have differed from most speculators is that
when I felt I was truly right, dead right, then I would go all the
way, shoot the works, as I did during the 1929 market crash, when
I had a line of 1 million shares of stock out on the short side, and
every rise and fall of a single point meant a million dollars to me.
Even then, my biggest play, it was never the money that drove me.
It was the game, solving the puzzle, beating the market that had
confused and confounded the greatest minds in history. For me,
the passion, the juice, the exhilaration was in beating the game, a
game that was a living dynamic riddle, a conundrum to everyone
who speculated on Wall Street.
“Perhaps it was like combat is to a soldier. It’s a mental high
that’s also visceral. All your senses are pushed to the limit.
“I’ve always told you boys to stay in the business you’re good at,
and I was good at speculating. Over the years I took many millions
of dollars out of Wall Street and invested them in Florida land, air-
craft companies, oil wells, and new ‘miracle’ products based on
new inventions. They were all abject failures, disasters. I lost every
cent I ever invested in them.
“Just remember, without discipline, a clear strategy, and a con-
cise plan, a speculator will fall into all the emotional pitfalls of the
market and jump from one stock to another, holding a losing posi-
tion too long, cutting out of a winner too soon for no reason other
than fear of losing the profit. Greed, fear, impatience, and hope
will all fight for mental dominance over the speculator. Then, after
a few failures and catastrophes, the speculator may become demor-
alized, depressed, and despondent, and may abandon the market

and the chance to make a fortune from what the market has to
offer.
“Develop your own strategy, discipline, and approach to the
market. I offer my suggestions as one who has traveled the road
before you. Perhaps I can act as a guide for you and save you from
falling into some of the pitfalls that befell me.

THE USUAL FOURSOMEWAS GATHERED FOR LIVERMORE’S
usual Monday night high-stakes bridge game:Walter Chrysler, Al-
fred Sloan, Ely Culbertson, and Jesse Livermore. There was a
knock at the closed library door.
“Come in,” Livermore said.
The butler entered, leading a cow with a big blue bow tied
around her neck. Dorothy followed him in and said, “I hope I’m
not interrupting.”
“No, darling, of course not. Why would you think you were
interrupting by bringing a living, breathing cow into the library
while we’re playing bridge?” Livermore responded.
“J.L., I did it for a reason. It’s your coffee break now, and you’re
always complaining about how the cream is never fresh, especially
for those solitary six o’clock breakfasts. I thought the cow would
help.”
The players broke up laughing. Dorothy and the butler left after
the butler served the coffee. The cow was left behind. The foursome
returned to their bridge hands and started to play, ignoring the cow,
who was just standing there looking around when Chrysler said,
“J.L. I think you better get that bovine out of here before she does
her business on your twenty-thousand-dollar Persian carpet.”
They cracked up again as they watched Livermore get up and
personally escort the cow out of the library, yelling for Dorothy
and the butler.
Dorothy was the perfect foil for Livermore. She was his mirror
image, his perfect match, and he knew it. She was spontaneous, he
was reserved; she blurted out whatever was in her brain, and no
one ever knew what was really in Livermore’s brain. Together they
made larger people of each other, and they both knew it.
Livermore’s greatest years, personally and in the market, were
between 1920 and 1930. He entered the 1930s with great hope,

but he was faced with increasingly severe personal problems.
Dorothy was drinking heavily and they were fighting constantly.
The boys were always sent away to school and summer camp. They
felt alienated and distant from their parents and, as a result,
shunned them.
Jesse Jr., a remarkably handsome, high-spirited boy, was grow-
ing into manhood and starting to get into trouble. He was having
difficulty in school and fighting with both his parents when he was
at home for the summer.
Livermore himself was always attracted to beautiful women.
Showgirls were his Achilles’ heel. He had a magnetic presence
thanks to his power, money, and mysterious ways. Women were
attracted to him like moths to a flame. Showgirls and actresses were
a perfect setup for him. He could date them, go out, have a good
time, then usually forget about them and move on to the next rela-
tionship.
But his liaisons were constantly filtering back to Dorothy. She
hated it. She had been 18 when she married him, and she had no
experience with men other than Livermore. She was frustrated
and hurt. He was the love of her life, and she could feel him drift-
ing away from her.
This all manifested itself in payback when Dorothy met a very
handsome treasury agent, a prohibition specialist named J. Walter
Longcope. She had an affair ofher own. Longcope was semifamous
for his undercover work in New York City in 1927. Handsome as
a movie star, he had the good looks of a young Gary Cooper.
Longcope was part of a group of revenue agents who posed as
thirsty college students looking for fun. They busted the flamboy-
ant Texas Guinan, a famous woman of the 1920s, who ran one of
the biggest speakeasies in New York.
Longcope was quoted as saying his undercover group spent
$7,000 in expense account money, drinking and dining while

obtaining crucial evidence for the famous raid he led on Guinan’s
300 Club. There was a well-publicized trial after the raid in which
Longcope served as a witness. Guinan was acquitted. She had
many friends in high places.
Dorothy finally filed for divorce and took up temporary resi-
dence in Reno, Nevada, with her new lover, Agent Longcope. On
Friday, September 16, 1932, she divorced the great financier on
grounds of desertion. They had been married since December 2,
1918—14 years. Dorothy retained custody of the boys.
Judge Thomas F. Moran sat on the bench for the hearing. In
order to have the divorce validated, Livermore had to take the
stand himself and affirm that he had deserted his wife on July 15,
1931. As he spoke he looked over at Dorothy, who had matured
but was still beautiful. He said what he was supposed to. Judge
Moran granted the divorce decree.
Livermore and Dorothy left the courtroom a few minutes later,
walking side by side, not speaking. She took one final look at him.
They stood there in the lobby of the courtroom, face to face, in
silence. Livermore shook his head and walked away.
Dorothy immediately walked over to Longcope, who stood in a
corner. She took his arm and walked back into the courtroom.
She smiled at Judge Moran, who smiled back at her before he
began the wedding ceremony. She later told her sons that she was
a single woman for almost 20 minutes.
It reminded Livermore of his first Reno divorce from Nettie
Jordan on December 2, 1918, and his marriage the next day to
Dorothy—history almost repeating itself.
Livermore followed the same settlement plan as he had in his
first divorce. He gave Dorothy everything she wanted:the house,
the jewels, and a $1 million trust fund for herself and each of the
boys, as well as a $1 million handpicked stock market portfolio.
Livermore always believed he could make more money for him-

self. All he needed was a decent stake of cash to carry on in the
market, so why not give his former wives what they wanted?
Dorothy’s first act after her marriage to Longcope was to
sell the $1 million stock portfolio Livermore had chosen. She
bought railroad bonds. She was angry, very angry. Her drinking
increased. Later, the “safe” railroad bonds would become worth-
less; the stocks Livermore picked for her would rise in price to
over $50 million by the 1950s. She did not care. She wanted his
memory gone. But he would never really be gone from her life.
She spoke of him at least once every day for the remainder of
her life.
Livermore left Reno and returned to New York. He sank like a
stone. He disappeared into a deep, dark depression. The same dark
cloud that had never been far from him all his life now totally
enveloped him.
Soon after the divorce, Livermore met Harriet Metz Noble of
Omaha, Nebraska. They met in New York through Alexander P.
Moore, who introduced them at a cocktail party in his New York
penthouse. Attracted to each other, they immediately began to go
out at night, particularly to the Stork Club, where Livermore was
very well known; he was a close friend of the owner, Sherman
Billingsley. The Stork Club was the place to be and to be seen in
the 1930s.
One evening, when Harriet and Livermore were there for late
drinks, in walked Georgie Jessel, a great wit and master of cere-
monies. He was always full of surprises. This evening he had a tall,
startlingly beautiful black woman on his arm. She towered over
Georgie by at least a foot. The unwritten law in the Stork Club
was that blacks were not welcome. Jessel knew this. Nevertheless,
he walked up to the maître d’ and asked for a table. The maître d’
went immediately to Billingsley and asked him what to do.

Billingsley rose from the table and walked up to Jessel and
his date.
A silence fell over the room as Billingsley spoke. “Georgie, you
have a reservation? The maître d’ says no.”
Jessel put his arm around his date and said, “Yes, Sherman, I
have a reservation here at the Stork Club, and it was made by a
very important man a long time ago.”
“And who might that be, Georgie?” Billingsley asked.
“Abraham Lincoln. He made my reservation for me.”
The room exploded into laughter. Livermore rose from his table
and walked over to Jessel, who had been invited to parties at his
home in Great Neck.
“Hello Georgie,” Livermore said. “I have room at my table for
you and your tall friend, so why don’t you join us?”
“My pleasure, J.L. It’s always my pleasure to join a gentleman.”
They walked to the table, and the room settled back to normal.
The next day Billingsley called and thanked Livermore for defus-
ing the situation of the night before.
Harriet was a wealthy woman whose family owned the Metz
Brewery in Omaha. She had been an accredited concert singer and
New York socialite. After six months of dating, she and Livermore
decided to get married.
On March 28, 1933, Livermore and the 38-year-old Harriet
were married in Geneva, Illinois. There was no honeymoon.
It was Harriet’s fifth marriage. All four of her previous husbands
had committed suicide.
The newlyweds immediately moved into a beautiful suite of
rooms occupying an entire floor of the Sherry Netherland Hotel
on Fifth Avenue across from Central Park. The apartment con-
sisted of a beautiful living and dining area, a library and two large
bedrooms.

On May 30, 1933, Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was formed in
1934, headed by Joseph P. Kennedy (the father of John F.
Kennedy), who wrote the SEC rules. President Roosevelt had
asked Kennedy to write the legislation, which would go on to
withstand the test of time.
Roosevelt reportedly said to Kennedy, with a smile, “Joe, since
you have probably done everything a person can do on the stock
exchange to make money, I believe I can safely assume that you’re
the man to write the new rules.” As a reward, Kennedy was later
appointed ambassador to Britain, a highly prestigious post.
Kennedy was a student of Andrew Carnegie, the great steel robber
baron, who said, “Money always sanctifies itself in the second gen-
eration.” Kennedy wanted to start in the first generation. He had
several sons to make into presidents and many sins to sanctify.
These new rules changed the market complexion; now the
issuers of stock had to work within the rules. The government’s
aim was to protect the buyers. The character of the market
changed for a while, but human nature did not change for a sec-
ond. Livermore studied the new rules and wondered if he would
have to change his rules and strategies to adjust to the new rules.
Later he said with a smile, “There were no serious changes neces-
sary with the new rules coming into effect.”
Dorothy, Livermore’s former wife, had vowed she would never
return to Evermore after the divorce. She wanted nothing more to
do with the estate. The memories tortured her. But she did return
to live there for a short time. She had several small dogs. She
refused to take them for walks on the expansive estate. She did
nothing to stop them from urinating and defecating on the price-
less Persian rugs. When the rugs became too foul and the stench
was too much, she had them rolled up and thrown into the trash.

The foundation for one of the rooms in the mansion had sunk
about three inches. The room was sloped down on the water side.
One day Dorothy and the butler walked into the room and leveled
the antique furniture by sawing the appropriate legs. This included
sawing the legs of a Louis XIV desk valued at $100,000, as well as
several other pieces of that quality.
Finally, she collected up some of the furnishings, carpets, art,
and mementos and moved them into her New York apartment.
When the taxes came due, she refused to pay them. She sent a
letter to Livermore and told him to pay the taxes. He ignored her.
She was advised that the house and contents would be sold at auc-
tion if she did not pay the tax bill.
“So? Let them sell the house and everything in it. Why would I
care? They’re all bad memories for me now.”
Inside the house was one of the finest collections of antique fur-
niture that had ever been assembled in America. Livermore had
spent millions collecting it. The property, exclusive of the furni-
ture, was appraised at $1.35 million in 1932. Livermore had spent
over $150,000 on landscaping the property alone. The silverware
was appraised at $100,000;there was $309,000 in jade ornaments;
there was a $10,000 needlepoint screen;and there was Dorothy’s
custom Rolls-Royce, worth $22,000.
The auction hammer fell on June 22, 1933. The house and
property went for $168,000;the needlepoint screen went for $800;
and Mrs. Guggenheim of New York bought Dorothy’s jet-black
Rolls-Royce convertible, with the gold embossed letters D.L. on
the doors, for $4,750. The total amount rendered at the auction
for the property and all the furnishings was $250,000. The coun-
try was in the very depths of the Great Depression.
Early the next morning, ensconced in his office, Livermore read
of the auction in the newspaper. He took a deep breath, folded the
newspaper, and dropped it in the trash can. He sat still, lifeless, in

his chair, staring at the green chalkboards and the secret markings
that had always looked to him like the sheet music for a symphony
performed only for himself. Today, it was just a jumble of glyphs.
He looked out the window at New York waking up. His eyes
misted over. He took a deep breath as the door opened and Harry
Edgar Dache walked in with the first of the chalkboard markers.
They nodded at the boss. The board marker silently put on his
alpaca jacket and headphones. He climbed the steps to post the
London and Paris markets, which were hours ahead of New York.
Livermore looked away from the board and back at the newspaper
in the trash basket.
He still had his boys, his two beautiful boys.
Shortly after the house in Great Neck was auctioned, Dorothy
had her friend, confidant, and employee, Lucien, drive to the
entrance of her apartment in New York City in her 16-cylinder
light gray Cadillac convertible.
She jumped into the back seat with a picnic basket and a few
bottles of whiskey.
“Lucien, I want to go to Santa Barbara.”
“Where’s that?” Lucien asked.
“California.”
“When, madam?”
“Now will be fine, Lucien. Let’s get going.”
“Why?” he asked.
“Because it as far away from that bastard Jesse Livermore as I can
get. And I want the boys far away from him and his women!”
They were going through a nasty custody battle for the chil-
dren. Livermore believed that Dorothy was drinking too heavily,
and she believed his libertine attitude toward women was not
healthy for the boys.
“I see,” Lucien said. Well aware of the couple’s battles, he put
the car in gear and started driving.

“And Lucien, I heard from a friend it is the center of fun for
those Californians who count,” she added.
Lucien drove and drove and drove until they reached Santa Bar-
bara, with Dorothy hardly ever leaving the back seat, keeping the
top down as much as possible, enjoying her picnic lunches and
drinks in the back. When they reached Santa Barbara, she went
immediately to a real estate agent and rented the biggest furnished
house she could find. She found one in Montecito—a big,
obscene, pink stucco mansion.
There was more bad news for Livermore. He learned, through a
private detective, that Boston Billy Monaghan wanted revenge for
what he believed was an excessive sentence. He thought Liver-
more and the other powerful people he had robbed had lobbied
the judge to put him away forever and set an example.
Livermore had never spoken to the judge. However, he was
not sure about the other rich people who had been Monaghan’s
victims.
On September 23, 1933, in a seemingly unrelated incident,
there was a murder on board a gambling ship, the Johanna Smith,
anchored three miles off the Long Beach, California, coast. There
had been a wild argument between Buell Dawson, a young, well-
known gangster, and James Walsh, a recently released convict and
former cellmate of Boston Billy Monaghan. The argument had
been resolved when Walsh pulled a pistol and shot Dawson dead.
The police found the murder weapon in a washroom and con-
fronted Walsh with it. There were also several witnesses to the
murder.
Walsh confessed and explained to the police that the shooting
took place as a result of a fierce argument between the two men as
to the best method of kidnapping Livermore and E. L. Doheny, a
wealthy Californian in the oil business.

LIVERMORE’S LUCK SOURS • 255 •
The news shook Livermore. It was one more thing that he did
not need in his life.
On October 27, 1933, a breach-of-promise civil suit was filed in
the New York Supreme Court against Livermore by Nadia Kras-
nova, an outstanding beauty and actress, who had been Liver-
more’s long-term mistress. Her suit was for $250,000.
This suit upset his new wife, Harriet, who had known nothing
of the long-term affair. She was a naturally possessive and jealous
woman. This revelation of another woman, her new husband’s
lover, led to major discord in the marriage. They battled almost
every day about the affair with Nadia. Harriet made him vow to
call her every hour on the hour, no matter where he was, no mat-
ter what he was doing. “You have broken your trust with me! I
doubt if I can ever forgive you!”
This was just one more thing that was not going right in Liver-
more’s life. Perhaps the bigger question was why Livermore
needed a mistress when he had a new wife. What was missing from
his life?
Plus, Livermore knew he was losing his trading skills. His atten-
tion, discipline, and energy were all deteriorating. His passion for
the market was waning, and he did not know why. Was it the
divorce from Dorothy? Was it not seeing the boys very often? Was it
his new wife driving him down? Had his success in the 1929 crash
caused him to lose interest in the market? Could he not deal with
success? Was it 1907 all over again, when he had lost his fortune?
Where were the blackness, the despair, and the emptiness coming
from? Where had they always come from? Was there nothing that
would make his soul happy? Give him peace and real contentment?
On December 19, 1933, Livermore fell into the deepest depres-
sion of his life. He left the apartment he now lived in at 1100 Park

Avenue at 3 P.M. and did not return home. Harriet called the
police: “He normally calls me every hour, on the hour. I fear
something has happened to him.”
A confidential wire was sent over the teletype system at 2:32 on
the morning of December 20 reporting that the famous financier
was missing. The teletype was terse and gave no information
except a brief description of Livermore and his age, 56. It was later
reported to the police that Livermore had failed to keep an
appointment with a friend at the Waldorf-Astoria that afternoon.
His chauffeur, who had been waiting outside, told the police that
Livermore had told him that he would not be needed and then
hailed a cab, disappearing into the city.
The news spread immediately down the corridors of Wall
Street. City and state police were called in on the case. They inves-
tigated all the possibilities:amnesia, suicide, and kidnapping. They
were sure that if it were a kidnapping, they would receive a ransom
note any moment. The kidnapping possibility brought the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into the picture.
Livermore’s attorney, James O’Gorman, spoke to the press.
“I’m conducting my own private investigation, and I’m betting
Mr. Livermore will be back within twenty-four hours.”
At 6:15 Wednesday night, Livermore returned to his apartment
through the private entrance on Eighty-ninth Street, 26 hours
after he had departed. Reporters were gathered at the entrance.
Livermore walked past them without speaking and went directly
up to his apartment. There were detectives inside talking to
Harriet.
He looked pale and wan, shaky. He sat down and spoke to
them. “I just saw the papers and realized that you were looking for
me.”
“Where have you been?” Harriet asked. “I’ve been frantic with
worry about you. I thought maybe you’d been kidnapped.”

“No, I was in a hotel.”
“What hotel?” asked Detective Captain Louis Hams.
“The Hotel Pennsylvania,” Livermore responded. He handed
the key to his wife, who handed it to the police.
“How did you get down there?” Hams asked.
“Taxi.”
“What happened?” Harriet demanded.
“I don’t know. I’ve been in a daze since I left yesterday. I awak-
ened this afternoon dazed and confused, then I finally read the
paper that was shoved under my door. I immediately came back.”
“Was it amnesia, then?” Hams asked.
“I don’t know. I blacked out.”
Later, Captain Hams explained to the press that he had no idea
what ailment Jesse Livermore was suffering from to cause him to
disappear. “Livermore said he had no idea we were looking for
him, and when he found out he rushed right home.”
The police located the cab driver, Abe Kamarick, and ques-
tioned him. The driver told the police that when Livermore
entered the cab he immediately threw up all over the back seat. He
was sweating and his hands were shaking. He also said that Liver-
more paid him “real good” to clean up the awful mess.
The police investigated further at the Hotel Pennsylvania. They
found that Livermore had been staying in the suite of J. L. Lord, a
permanent guest of the hotel who kept a room year-round. The
police tried to locate Lord with no success. They dropped the case,
since they now knew Livermore was safe.
Had the police persisted in their investigation, they would have
found out that J. L. Lord was an alias that Livermore used to rent
the room. He had rented the room for years. It was in this very
hotel that Livermore had conducted his dalliances during the time
he was married to Dorothy, including his long-term liaison with
the beautiful Nadia Krasnova, the Greta Garbo look-alike.

Livermore’s spirit left him. His personality changed. Even his
friends began to notice that the Great Bear of Wall Street had lost
his claws. He was despondent, distant;his thoughts seemed blurry
and disconnected. His all-consuming interest in the market was
dying. He moved his offices to 120 Broadway and let his chalk-
board markers go. He stopped seeing his core of old friends: Ed
Hutton, Walter Chrysler, Ed Kelley, Alexander P. Moore, and
William Durant.
He stopped his bridge games at the Metropolitan Club, some-
thing he had loved, and also dropped poker and backgammon.
Even his appearance seemed to change—he was still a natty
dresser, but he was now just slightly behind the fashions. He also
had a vacant stare much of the time, a long-distance stare that per-
plexed his friends, who felt that he was staring off into space even
when they were talking to him.
He was also having serious problems with his son Jesse Jr. He
had found out that Jesse, a handsome lad who looked older than
his years, had been having sex with some of the women in their
Great Neck set, some of Dorothy’s friends. He had started having
sex with these women when he was 14. He had also discovered the
liquor cabinet when he was 14, and he liked what liquor did
to him.
Young Jesse was having trouble at his school, Choate, and he
hated the fact that his mother had moved to Santa Barbara. “There
is no place that I can think of that is further away from that man,”
she had explained to him and her friends after she moved.
Jesse had loved living in New York and being near his father,
who doted on him, giving him whatever he wanted, whenever he
wanted it. Jesse loved his father and vice versa. There was nothing
Livermore would not do for Jesse, and it was ruining the boy.
Dorothy knew this and took special pains to make it difficult for
Livermore to see the boys. This worked very well for Livermore’s

new wife, Harriet, who hated the boys because they distracted his
attention from her.
Paul, Livermore’s other son, a sensitive and handsome boy, had
a different temperament from that of his wild brother Jesse, who
was full of mischief and cunning. Paul was a gentle person, calm
and placid, happy to be by himself on the great estate, or playing
with his brother Jesse on the beach in front of the Breakers. He
had a highly creative mind, was good with his hands, and could fix
or build anything, like his grandfather. Paul was aware that Jesse
got all the attention, but he was not envious. He was content
within himself.
In fact, Paul was slightly in awe of his brother and wondered
how he could walk such a tightrope between their parents, often
using their intense feelings for each other and for himself against
them, manipulating them easily.
Things in general turned sour for Livermore. His financial for-
tunes snowballed downhill at a rapid rate. Articles started to appear
in the press revealing judgments against him. The first article
appeared on January 10, 1934, in the New York Times, outlining a
$13,130 judgment in favor of John J. Tierney, a member of the
New York Stock Exchange. Another appeared on February 2,
1934, reporting a judgment of $90,840 in favor of brokers Ben-
jamin Block and Company. Ben Block was a friend of Liver-
more’s. Livermore made no attempt to defend the suits, and they
were all lost in summary judgments.
Livermore was finally leveled on March 5, 1934. He filed for
bankruptcy in federal court. Samuel Gilman, the great trader’s
attorney, gave a statement to the New York Times: “On each of the
three previous occasions on which my client has failed, he has ulti-
mately paid one hundred cents on the dollar to all his creditors. I
can assure you that Mr. Livermore will once again triumph over
his present difficulties.” The disputed breach-of-promise claim by

Nadia Krasnova was also included and settled in the bankruptcy.
What no one knew was that Livermore, through his friend
Alexander P. Moore, had secretly given her $5,000 to help her
move to California.
On his lawyer’s advice, Livermore had borrowed $100,000 from
Harriet. The loan was secured by the interest from his $1 million
trust fund—a trust fund that he had set up in such an ironclad way
that he could never touch the principal. This trust fund survived
the bankruptcy.
On March 7, 1934, the bankrupt Livermore was automatically
suspended as a member of the Chicago Board of Trade. It was
never disclosed to anyone what had happened to the great fortune
he had made in the crash of 1929, five years earlier. He had lost
it all.
Livermore was, of course, depressed and disoriented. He was on
the brink of personal disaster, as well. On December 1, 1934, he
set sail on the Italian ocean liner Rex. He said to the New York
Times on his departure, “This is a long-belated wedding present
for me and my wife. I intend to study the European commodity
markets as a basis for my comeback.”
“Do you think you’ll come back this time Mr. Livermore?” a
reporter asked.
“I have made comebacks before, but this one will take longer
because world market conditions are worse,” he answered. What
he really meant was that it would take him longer to get back on
his feet because he had lost his emotional balance, and he was not
sure if he would ever get it back.
“What will you deal in?” he was asked.
“I expect I will deal in wheat and other commodities.”
Rumors and stories were constantly spread about Livermore. He
was always fascinating to the press and the Wall Street crowd. For

example, there was the “black cat” story spread by a Wall Street
stockbroker who said he knew how Livermore had called the crash
of 1929. The broker claimed he had found a cat with magical
powers. The broker took the cat home, and his luck changed. He
immediately made a big hit on the market, and every time the cat
had a litter of kittens, he would call Livermore, who would reverse
his position in the market—if he were long he would go short and
vice versa.
“That damn cat made Livermore a fortune,” the broker said.
“Then one day a year ago my cat died, and it destroyed Livermore.
That’s why he went bankrupt and lost his fortune!”
Livermore also languished under the cloud of being the Great
Bear of Wall Street. He had been blamed as one of the main causes
of the crash of 1929. But he found this ridiculous, because he
believed that no one person or group could ever change the over-
all direction of the market or even drive a stock down for a sus-
tained period of time. He knew that it was ultimately the sales and
profits of a stock, the financial backbone of a company, that won
out in the end, even though there could be a bumpy ride in the
journey. Nevertheless, people still blamed him, sometimes yelling
at him in public.
“Companies that make money consistently rise consistently,”
Livermore told all who would listen.
For the public, the nonprofessional stock players, there was
always the famous gray they in the market. They were raiding Steel
today. They were behind General Motors all week, pushing it up.
Theyhad a full-fledged bear raid going on with Standard Oil. They
were distributing stock right now because they knew the market
was finished. They were led by that bastard Livermore and his bas-
tard friends.
The public believed there was a club, headed by a powerful per-
son or group, that ran the market. The club supposedly consisted

of people like Livermore, James Keene, John “Bet-a-Million”
Gates, Bernard Baruch, William Durant, Arthur Cutten, and the
Fischer brothers. These people were believed to simply manipulate
the market as they desired, so the small trader was always the
sucker.
The public also had a strong view on price movements. Any
influences that pushed the market up were “positive” influences
and any influences that forced the market down were “negative”
influences. This was based on the premise that it was always good
for prices to rise, because when prices were rising, the brokers,
customers, company executives, and investing public were happy
and getting rich. But any person who was involved with the decline
of stock prices or making a profit from that decline was therefore
a monster, and most likely was unpatriotic to boot.
For Livermore, this attitude toward bears in the market was
ludicrous. It ignored the facts of what really happened. Livermore
said to the New York Times: “The public believes that this group of
elite men can drive a stock far below its ‘real value,’ its basic value.
If such a stock goes down, the public then erroneously presumes
that there is a group of super-traders, super-speculators, super fin-
anciers who are severely punishing the stock, pushing it below its
‘real value,’ to create an ‘absolute bargain.’ The public wrongly
assumes that smart speculators will not step in and buy it at the
depressed prices.”
There were people who firmly believed that if the bear in the
stock market could be declawed and caged forever, the markets
would go in only one direction—up, up, up!
No one has ever been able to prove that short selling damages
markets. In fact, there is a strong belief among many speculators
that a large short position actually represents a large reserve of buy-
ing power, because all that stock must be bought to cover the
shorts at some future date.

LIVERMORE’S LUCK SOURS • 263 •
There is also a contrarian theory that states that most investors
are wrong most of the time in foreseeing the direction of a stock
or the overall market. So if the short interest rises past a certain
point, contrarian speculators believe that this is a valid signal that
indicates it is the time to go long.
Livermore was an independent thinker. He believed that the
market was set up to fool most of the people most of the time.
Certainly there was no one who could call the market direction or
the direction of a stock all the time. If that was possible, that per-
son would already be the richest person on the planet.
Livermore believed in the free market system with limited gov-
ernment interference. He said: “In a free market system, prices
fluctuate. They never go up all the time and they never go down
all the time. This is good.”
All this did not stop people from tarring Livermore with accu-
sations ofbeing a ravaging bear and having caused the Great Crash.
He was ready for his trip to Europe. He needed it to regain his
sanity.
But he did not know that his greatest personal tragedy was just
ahead of him.

The Shooting of Jesse
Livermore Jr.
He remembered poor Julian and his romantic awe of them.
And how he had started a story that began:
“The very rich are different from you and me.”
“Yes, they have more money.”

THANKSGIVING DAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1935. IT WAS LATE.
They were both drunk.
Jesse Jr., 16 years old but looking 20, stood tall and defiant in the
living room, unsteady on his feet, wavering slightly from drink. He
looked athletic in his tan slacks and white shirt, with his white ten-
nis sweater casually tied around his shoulders.
Dorothy sat pie-eyed drunk on the couch.
There had been a Thanksgiving party at Dorothy’s rented pink
stucco mansion in Santa Barbara, where she had moved perma-
nently after her house in Great Neck had been auctioned. She had
divorced Jim Longcope, the prohibition agent, in August and was
now having a fling with D. B. Neville—who, like Longcope, was
handsome, charming, and had a deep interest in her money. Some
of her “companions” blatantly stole from her.
Both Jesse and Paul were home for the holidays and would be
returning to school shortly. Paul would head back to the Hotchkiss
School in northwest Connecticut, a tough, highly disciplined
environment, and Jesse would be going to his new school, the
exclusive Laguna Bianca, which he desperately did not want to
attend. He had finally left Choate, where it was almost obligatory
for every student to have his own horse for polo. For years, both
his mother and his father had labeled him as incorrigible. He only
laughed when they told him to straighten out.
Jesse did not want to return to school—any school. He told his
mother that he wanted to go to Europe instead and have some fun.
After the party, he took off in his 16-cylinder dual-exhaust
Chrysler convertible, which was equipped with cutouts to bypass
the mufflers. There was no mistaking when Jesse was behind the
wheel and the cutouts were engaged. He could be heard through-
out the quiet neighborhoods of Santa Barbara. Livermore had
called his good friend Walter Chrysler to buy the prototype sports
car and have it shipped to California for Jesse—nothing was too

good for his favorite son. Jesse drove fast and skillfully, drunk or
sober.
After the Thanksgiving party, Jesse had gone out for a drive to
see a girl and stop at the Biltmore Hotel for a few drinks. After-
ward, Jesse dropped the girl off and stormed into the house, blaz-
ing drunk, after midnight. His mother was in the living room,
drinking with Neville, when Jesse walked in.
Her son saw her and her companion in the living room.
“You’ve been drinking,” she said.
“You’re drunk, Mother. So don’t tell me I’ve been drinking.”
Jesse walked over to the bar and raised a full bottle of whiskey to
his lips. “I’ll show you that a man, a real man, can outdrink any
woman.”
Dorothy jumped from the couch and smacked the bottle out of
his hands. “I’d rather see my son dead than drinking himself to
death.”
Livermore bolted out of the room to the nearby small guest-
house on the property. He returned brandishing a shotgun. He
handed the stock of the shotgun to his mother and said, “Here, go
ahead and shoot me. I dare you!
Neville leapt from the couch and intervened. He wrestled the
gun from Dorothy’s hands. He quickly ran from the room to hide
the shotgun. As he did, Jesse bolted up the steps and flew into his
brother’s bedroom.
Paul awoke and looked at his brother. “What’s going on?” he
asked.
“Your mother wants to kill me.”
“Why?”
“Never mind why, where’s your rifle?”
“In the closet.”
“Ammo?”
“Right next to it. Twenty-two longs,” Paul said, studying his

brother. He watched as his brother quickly slipped a round
expertly into the chamber and locked it. It was a bolt-action,
single-shot rifle. Everyone in the family was a crack shot and knew
all about guns.
Jesse turned as he reached the bedroom doorway. “Go back to
sleep, Paul. There’s something I have to do.”
This was not the first dramatic drunken scene Paul had witnessed
between mother and brother. Jesse flipped off the light switch, and
Paul rolled over in his bed, pulling the covers over his head.
Jesse raced down the circular stairwell, rifle in hand.
His mother stood at the foot of stairs. She looked up at him. He
flipped the gun around and thrust the stock of the rifle into her
hands. She was adept with weapons;her small finger automatically
wrapped around the trigger as the stock slipped down her forearm.
“Now’s your chance, Mother! Your chance to kill me. But you
don’t have the nerve to pull the trigger.” With her finger around
the trigger, Jesse suddenly pulled the barrel toward himself. Fire
shot from the muzzle. The bullet entered his chest one inch from
his heart, traveled past his liver, and rested near the spine. He col-
lapsed on the stairs and rolled bleeding to the floor.
Neville entered after disposing of the shotgun and found the
boy slumped at the foot of the stairs.
Dorothy bellowed at the top of her voice over and over again:
“Oh, my God, I’ve shot my son. I’ve shot my boy. I shot my boy,
Oh God! God! God!”
Paul bolted out of bed at the sound of the gunshot. He ran
down the stairs to see his brother in a heap, bleeding. He ran to get
Lucien, Dorothy’s friend and employee, who was asleep in the
guestroom. Paul woke him and brought him to the living room.
Lucien immediately called Dr. Neville Usher, who came immedi-
ately to the home. As he arrived, so did Deputy Sheriff Jack Ross.
Dorothy was still shouting “I’ve shot my boy!” over and over.

THE SHOOTING OF JESSE LIVERMORE JR. • 269 •
An ambulance appeared just ahead of the doctor and the sheriff.
Jesse was taken immediately to Cottage Hospital. As he was slipped
into the ambulance, he whispered to the paramedics:“I’m all right.
It’s nothing. Don’t blame mother.”
At the hospital, he was still drunk and in great pain when they
gave him a whopping dose of morphine to kill the pain. Before he
was lost to the drugs, he told the police investigators: “It was an
accident. That’s all I wish to say about it. I’m too tired to talk now,
anyway.” He then slipped away into sleep.
Livermore was in Saint Louis, Missouri, with “Nina,” as he
called his new wife, Harriet, when he got the news. He chartered
a plane to take him to Los Angeles. A chauffeur-driven Ford
Phaeton was waiting at the airport to pick him up and speed him
to Santa Barbara. The case was covered in great detail by the New
York Times and the New York Daily News. In Los Angeles, he told
the press with clenched teeth, “If anything has happened to that
boy, I will see that she pays!”
Santa Barbara District Attorney Percy Heckendorf and Deputy
Sheriff Jack Ross questioned Dorothy for two hours but found her
dazed and in shock, not making any real sense. She was put in a
private room in the hospital and given a shot to quiet her down
and put her to sleep. When she awoke, she was placed under arrest
and taken to the county jail for more questioning.
The next day the doctor issued a press statement:“Jesse Liver-
more Jr. is slightly improved, but little change in his basic condi-
tion is expected for several hours.”
District Attorney Heckendorf made a statement of his own:
“Pending the outcome of the boy’s final condition, she will be
charged with assault with intent to kill.” He was implying that he
was waiting to see whether Jesse would die. In that event, they
were going to charge Dorothy with murder.
When Livermore arrived on the scene, he went directly to see

the doctors and then his son. He looked down at him and said,
“Fight, son. Please fight. I’m standing by you, my boy.”
On December 2, 1935, while Jesse was still fighting for his life
against incipient pneumonia and shock, Dorothy was arraigned on
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to com-
mit murder. She pleaded not guilty, and the following Monday was
set for a preliminary hearing. Her bail was set at $9,000. The
authorities were convinced she would not go far from her son,
even if she had shot him.
The story was big news, carried on all the wire services and in
all the important papers in the country. The Boy Plunger, the
Great Bear of Wall Street was in the news again, only this time it
was a tragedy, a real tragedy.
Livermore checked into the El Mirasol Hotel in downtown
Santa Barbara.
When Dorothy was released from jail, she went immediately to
the hospital and pleaded with the doctors:“I want to see my son,
my boy! I must see him.”
But the surgeons refused.
“Just for a moment!” she begged.
“No, not even for a moment. His condition is very sensitive,”
the surgeons replied. They had decided not to operate to remove
the bullet from where it was lodged near his spine until he was
stronger. The bullet had missed his heart by scant inches.
The news spread like wildfire. Dorothy got a call from Edward
J. Reilly, a famous lawyer who had defended Bruno Hauptman in
the Lindbergh kidnapping case, wanting to represent her. But Har-
rison Ryon, vice chairman of the California Bar Association, was
selected, and Livermore paid his fees. Ryon had acted for Liver-
more in his divorce from Dorothy.
When Ryon was asked if Livermore thought his wife was guilty
of trying to kill her own son, Ryon was quick to point out that “It

should be obvious that Mr. Livermore, by retaining my services, is
himself interested and active in his ex-wife’s defense on these
charges. That speaks for itself.”
Ryon was a powerful California lawyer. He said that he and Liv-
ermore had already designed her defense. “It’s the ‘unloaded gun’
defense. It is clear to myself and Mr. Livermore that the discharge
of the gun was purely accidental. The defense will prove that Mrs.
Livermore did not do the shooting on purpose. Mrs. Livermore
had no knowledge or suspicion that the gun was loaded.”
Then Jesse’s physicians announced that Jesse had said:“I don’t
want to see either my mother or my father. I want to lie here and
think things over for a week or so. And I don’t want to see the dis-
trict attorney either.”
The district attorney went along, “In deference to the boy’s
request, and his doctor’s concurrence, I will agree to put off the
questioning. I have plans to assemble more details of the shooting
over the next few days.”
Livermore took action. He sent an airplane to pick up Dr.
Joseph d’Avignon, a gunshot-wound expert from Lake Placid. It
was also announced that Dorothy would not be arraigned until
after the Christmas and New Year’s Day holidays. The final
announcement informed the public that Livermore had filed suit
to recover custody of both of his sons. He was given custody of
Paul immediately on a temporary arrangement.
On December 6, 1935, there was a piece on the shooting in the
New York Times.
The 16-year-old boy, Jesse Livermore Jr.’s physical wound is
not the only wound. From the stories that have been told so
far by the press it is plain that the boy was caught in a cross-
fire between his unhappy and embittered elders. As a result,
he has suffered intense spiritual hurt.

• 272 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
The various articles covering the shooting were read avidly by
those on Wall Street.
Then a turn for the worse came on December 16, as the Times
reported.
The condition of Jesse L. Livermore Jr., was reported as
“exceedingly grave” at Cottage Hospital. After a week of
slow but steady progress toward recovery from a bullet wound
inflicted in a quarrel by a shot fired by his mother, the youth
took a turn for the worse yesterday. He spent today under an
oxygen tent while the doctors studied new X-ray photo-
graphs and made lab tests of the fluid from the wound area in
his lower chest.
It was not until January 6, 1936, that Jesse was declared out of
danger. But for months, it was still necessary for his doctor or an
attending nurse to tap his chest for fluid every other day to prevent
infection. Later in his life, Jesse would tell his wife Pat that the
doctors and nurses would come into his room, ream out the
wound using an antiseptic and a Q-tip, and then drain it. Every
time, he would scream in pain at the top of his lungs, cursing his
mother for shooting him and his father for ignoring him all his life.
Even the morphine did not help.
Finally, on March 5, 1936, Dorothy was exonerated of all
charges before Ernest Wagner, a justice of the peace. It was Judge
Wagner who had ordered the complaint charging Dorothy with
assault with intent to kill after the preliminary hearing in January.
Jesse testified that he would assume all blame for the shooting,
which had followed an argument over his drinking. Dr. Neville
Usher, who was first on the scene and attended Jesse through his
long convalescence, testified that Dorothy had been under the

influence of alcohol and was incapable of remembering anything
she might have said at the time.
When specifically questioned about her having said:“I have shot
my boy! I’ve shot my son,” the respected physician replied he
could not recall that he had ever heard her say that.
Months later, on March 25, the bullet lodged near Jesse’s spine
was finally removed at Post-Graduate Hospital in New York City.
Dr. John Moorhead, chiefofsurgeons at the hospital, performed the
operation. But Jesse would always have a scar and a slight curvature
of the spine, which he did his best to hide. He was also, because of
this wound, rejected for military service in World War II.
Livermore was given permanent custody of both boys.
In 1935, Livermore had moved into the Sherry Netherland
Hotel on Fifth Avenue across from Central Park. The Sherry
Netherland was an exclusive elegant hotel-residence for some of
the most prominent people in the world. Livermore took an entire
upper floor. The apartment suite was spacious, furnished with Liv-
ermore and his new wife’s favorite things. There was a kitchen,
living room, dining room, den, and two bedrooms, including one
for Paul when he was home, which was rarely. A maid who also
cooked came every day—and, of course, there was always room
service available to provide anything they wanted.
Paul lived with his father and Harriet when he was not at board-
ing school or away at summer camp. Paul hated living there and
called his father’s new wife “the Bitch-Witch.” He found her a
dark and depressing presence. He could feel her hatred for him and
his brother. She wanted his father’s undivided attention.
One afternoon, he was playing soccer on the fields of
Hotchkiss, his boarding school in Lakeville, Connecticut, when
one of his friends came up to him. He said, “Paul, isn’t that your
mother coming up the drive?” The boy pointed at a black Rolls,

his father’s Rolls. Dorothy often borrowed Livermore’s Rolls and
chauffeur to drive her to visit Paul.
Paul ran over, and out of the car stepped Harriet, his step-
mother, a surprise visit. She scared him so deeply that he ran across
the soccer fields to his dormitory, screaming.
His father later made him call and apologize to Harriet. But that
did not stop his fear of her. She was very possessive of his father
and insisted on summer camp for Paul so he would not be in the
apartment with them during his summer vacation. Paul always
brought home a school chum over holidays in order to insulate
himself from her. He also needed the company for the long peri-
ods of time he would otherwise be alone in the apartment.
On July 31, 1936, Dorothy Livermore Longcope sued Liver-
more in a New York court. She wanted a summons issued against
him to obtain money for the hospital expenses Jesse had incurred
after the shooting. The judge refused to issue a summons and
advised her to carry out other legal remedies. He threw the case
out of court. Livermore was informed of the action and could
only shake his head in astonishment.
When Jesse was well, fully recovered, Livermore sent him on
the trip to Europe he had wanted.
Livermore himself stayed at home.
Livermore’s next battle was with the Internal Revenue Service,
after he was hit with an $800,000 tax bill. He negotiated and set-
tled the claim with the IRS in the same year.
In the summer, he was ready for a fishing excursion. He char-
tered the Ranger, a deep-sea fishing boat that ran out of Montauk
Point. In the early afternoon, trolling off Montauk slightly into
Long Island Sound, he hooked into a broadbill swordfish. Locked
into the fighting chair, he fought the fish for over an hour using
only 36-pound-test line. The fish ran long and hard, jumping,

sounding, but with an expert captain, John Sweeting, at the helm,
it was an equal battle between human and fish.
Finally, the fish was brought alongside the boat. It was hoisted
out of the water with a block and tackle and weighed at the dock.
It weighed 486 pounds and remains a record as the second-largest
swordfish ever caught off Montauk Point on rod and reel.
Two years later, on November 14, 1937, at the age of 18, Jesse
married Evelyn Sullivan, the daughter ofHen Bletzer, who for years
promoted prizefights and operated a bar in Baltimore. Evelyn gave
her age as 20, and it was reported that she had been married before,
four years prior to this wedding. Dorothy was at the wedding to give
her blessings. In fact, she assisted in obtaining the license and wit-
nessed the marriage ceremony. Jesse was particularly happy to be out
of the oppressive presence of the dour and gloomy Harriet.
Livermore did not attend. As a wedding present, he bought his
son the Pepsi-Cola bottling franchise for Connecticut.
In 1938 and 1939, Livermore sank lower and lower in his
depression. He was still playing the markets, but not like in the old
days when he would be consumed with energy and passion to get
to work, to beat the game, to apply all his energies on the stock
market, the grain markets, the overall market.
Those high times of the 1920s and the pure fun of living were
gone. He had ruined it with his affairs and carrying on. Sure,
Dorothy drank, but her drinking only got worse after the affairs,
the humiliation, and the desertion.
Dorothy was complimentary mirror image to his personality.
He was repressed and cerebral; she was outgoing and instinctive.
And she was beautiful. He missed her more as time passed. The
fun, the joy, the laughter were gone from his life.
He started having recurring nightmares for the first time in
his life.

• 276 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
In late 1939, Livermore’s son Jesse suggested that he write a
book about his experiences and techniques in trading in the stock
and commodity markets. This brought a flash of life back into Liv-
ermore:a mission, a goal, and a purpose. He began at once, think-
ing perhaps it would rekindle his spirit. The book was completed
and published by Duell, Sloan, and Pearce in March 1940. It was
titled How to Trade in Stocks.
The book did not sell well. The world war was underway, and
the general interest in the stock market was low. His methods were
still new and controversial at the time, and they received mixed
reviews from the stock market gurus of the period.
They remain controversial today.
Livermore said that his basic theories were just the beginning, as
Sigmund Freud’s and Carl Jung’s were in the study of the human
mind. In his book he said, “I know people will take these thoughts
I offer to new and better heights. Don’t worry, I won’t be jealous.
I wish them all well. I agree with Virgil:‘Exoriare aliquis nostris ex
ossibus ultor.’ Let someone arise from my bones as an avenger.”

ON WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1940, THE 63-YEAR-OLD
Livermore and his wife, Harriet, whom he had nicknamed
“Nina,” were at the Stork Club, Livermore’s favorite club. The
house photographer came up and asked if he could take a photo.
“Of course you can,” Livermore said. “But it’s the last picture
you will take, because tomorrow I’m going away for a long, long
time.”
Nina was shocked. She asked Livermore, “Laurie, what do you
mean?”
“Only a joke, darling, only a joke.” He smiled back at her.
The flashbulb fired. Several people came by from time to time
to join them, and Nina had a few dances with friends. Livermore
looked on, a faraway stare in his eye. His food went untouched;he
had long since lost his appetite. He looked thin and wan.
The next day, November 28, at noon, he wandered up from his
offices in the Squibb building at 745 Fifth Avenue and entered the
Sherry Netherland Hotel. He stopped to say hello to Eugene Voit,
the manager. He had lived in the hotel for years before moving to
Park Avenue. He often stopped by for a cocktail on his walk home
from work.
At 12:30 he sat down for lunch alone, which was not unusual.
He was well known to the staff and a favorite regular at the hotel
bar and restaurant. He sat near the bar and accepted his old-
fashioned, which the bartender automatically made when he saw
him enter. He spoke to no one during lunch. He appeared to the
waiter to be distraught and intense.
Throughout his lunch, he would whip out his favorite small
leather-covered memorandum book and extract the gold pen
attached to the chain on his vest to write. He wrote hurriedly,
a page or two at a time, like someone who had a lot to say but
could only say a little at any moment. Each time he replaced the

notebook in his pocket. He did this several times through lunch.
He smoked cigarette after cigarette as he sat there. At 2:30, he left
the hotel and returned to his office.
He came back to the Sherry Netherland at 4:30 in the after-
noon and went directly to his favorite table near the bar. As usual,
he was handed an old-fashioned as he sat down. Livermore smiled
at the waiter but said nothing. He sat there for an hour, taking his
notebook out and writing in it, then replacing it. He ordered one
more old-fashioned during the hour he sat there.
He finally rose from his table and walked out of the bar into the
lobby.
To get to the men’s washroom in this hotel, it was necessary to
enter the lobby and walk about 120 feet, through swinging doors
that obscured the view, to an area which then led into the banquet
room, the cloakroom, and the washrooms.
At 5:33, Livermore walked through the swinging doors and
slipped through the closed door of the dim, dark, cloakroom. He
took a seat on the stool at the end of the cloakroom. He withdrew
a .32-caliber Colt automatic pistol and slid the barrel back, pop-
ping a round into the chamber. The clip was full. He had bought
the gun in 1928 when he was living at Evermore.
He placed the barrel of the gun behind his right ear and pulled
the trigger.
The bullet ripped through his brain. He died instantly.
A few minutes later, the assistant manager, Patrick Murray, was
making his hourly rounds when he opened the door to the cloak-
room. He saw Livermore slumped in the chair. At first he thought
he should not disturb him, that Livermore was asleep. Then he saw
a pool of blood on the floor and the gun.
He ran back to the reception desk and called the police. The
news spread like wildfire. Reporters and newspaper photographers

crowded into the hotel lobby. Two radio cars sped up to the
entrance;four patrolmen were stationed in the lobby and entrance.
Inspector Patrick J. Kenney, who ultimately led the investigation,
arrived in an unmarked car along with Captain Edward Mullins
of the East Sixty-seventh Street station. Inspector Kenney, after
appraising the situation, phoned the Livermore apartment on Park
Avenue to notify Mrs. Livermore that her husband had shot himself.
“What? What are you telling me? He’s been ill lately.
Maybe . . .”
“I’m sorry ma’am, but I’m afraid your husband is gone from a
bullet wound.”
There was a dead silence on the other end of the phone. He
heard a thump on the floor. Inspector Kenney was a seasoned offi-
cer. He had known people to faint on the phone before from the
news he had given them. He sent a squad car over to make sure she
was all right.
The police phoned Jesse Livermore Jr. to give him the news. He
arrived by taxi at 6:45, shaking and visibly upset. He was accom-
panied by Harry Edgar Dache, Livermore’s office manager. Liver-
more’s body had not been moved. Jesse was led into the
cloakroom. He walked to the far end where his father was slumped
dead on the stool, the gun on the floor in the pool of blood. He
identified the body and collapsed, slumping down in the far cor-
ner. He was raised to his feet by a police officer and Dache.
He would not leave the body. He waited in the lobby until the
medical examiner, Inspector Raymond O. Miles, arrived at 9.
They left the body untouched until the medical examiner came,
examined the scene, and released the body. The medical examiner
verified the police verdict of suicide.
Dache made immediate arrangements to remove the body to
the Campbell Funeral Chapel at Madison Avenue and Eighty-first
Street.

At 8:30 that same night, Paul Livermore was studying in his
room at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. There was a knock
on the door. “Paul, you’re wanted in the headmaster’s office,” a
student told him.
Paul walked down the long halls to the headmaster’s office. He
knocked on the door. “Come in,” was the response.
Paul stood in front of the headmaster. He was 17, slim, a good
athlete and student, and movie-star handsome, like his brother. He
would later actually become an actor in movies and various televi-
sion series. “Yes sir?” he said.
“Young man, I’m afraid I have something to tell you, and there
is no easy way to do it.” He stepped out from behind his desk.
“I’m sorry to have to tell you that your father killed himself this
evening in New York. He shot himself. A car and chauffeur have
been sent from New York to drive you to the city. The car is wait-
ing outside.”
Paul stood numb for a second and actually doubled over, as if he
had been punched in the stomach. He went down on one knee,
dizzy. He felt a wave of nausea sweep over him. He grabbed for the
edge of the headmaster’s desk. The headmaster circled the desk
and helped him to his feet. He gave him a glass of cold water, and
after a few short minutes, he walked him to the waiting Packard
town car in the driveway, where Frank, the chauffeur, waited, out
of uniform. Frank helped him into the back seat.
Paul Livermore sat alone in the dark silence of the rear seat of
the Packard as the lights flashed by him on the parkways that led
back to New York City. He was too numb, too dazed, and too
confused to cry.
The police revealed that there was a suicide note of eight small
handwritten pages in Livermore’s personal notebook. It was
reported in the November 30 New York Tribune.
The press wanted to know what it said. Tersely, the police

responded. “There was a leather-bound memo book found in Mr.
Livermore’s pocket. It was addressed to his wife.” A police
spokesman read from the notebook:“‘My dear Nina:Can’t help it.
Things have been bad with me. I am tired of fighting. Can’t carry
on any longer. This is the only way out. I am unworthy of your
love. I am a failure. I am truly sorry, but this is the only way out for
me.’ He signed the eight-page note, ‘Love Laurie,’ which we pre-
sume was a nickname, maybe from his middle name, Lauriston.”
The police went on to explain that this theme of failure, deso-
lation, and despair was repeated throughout the book, with the
identical words used over and over again. They said it was not an
incoherent note, just repetitious, and obviously had been written
under great emotional stress.
A little after 10 that night, the Packard rolled up in front of the
private entrance and elevator to the Livermore apartment at 1100
Park Avenue. Frank rang the bell.
“Is that you, Frank?” Harriet asked.
“Yes ma’am,” he replied.
“Paul with you?”
“Yes ma’am.”
“Good, send him in. You wait there for me. I’ll be down in a
few moments,” she said through the speaker as she buzzed him in.
When Paul walked in, he saw Harriet, fully dressed, moving
quickly about the apartment. There were three paper bags by the
door. They were full to the top with cash, cash enclosed in bank
wrappers.
She saw him as he entered. “Hello Paul,” she said, stopping her
movement, her hands full of cash.
“Hello,” he said.
“Paul, come and sit on the couch.” He did as he was told. “The
school told you about your father?”

“Yes.”
“Look Paul, I just talked to a friend, a lawyer, who told me the
police often investigate suicides like they do homicides. They
came already, a uniformed officer in a squad car, to see if I was all
right. I’m afraid they might come here and search the apartment
and I could not explain certain things. Your father kept too much
cash in the house. So I’m going to go for the evening. Besides, I’m
very upset, but I have to try and think straight. I must think
straight. You understand?”
“Sure.”
“Okay, I’m in a hurry. They could arrive any moment. I’m not
going far, just to a hotel. But you tell the police that I’ve gone to
see a friend if they come, okay? I’ll send Frank back to be with you
after he takes me to the hotel.”
“I’m okay. I don’t need Frank.”
“You sure?”
“Yes.”
“Alright then, I have to go.”
Paul waited as she went to the safe in the living room. He
watched as she swept her jewels out of the safe into the paper
shopping bag, using her forearm. She disappeared into the bed-
room. He could hear her opening and closing bureau doors,
dumping more jewelry into the last shopping bag. She came out
with a shopping bag half full of jewelry and stuffed a sweater in
on top.
“See, Paul, I use these shopping bags because nobody would
ever suspect what was in them,” she said. “I’ll take care of every-
thing in the morning.”
Paul walked her to the door as she slipped on her coat. She swept
up the other shopping bags with the cash and left. He watched her
take the private elevator down to the waiting chauffeur.

Later he was to estimate that she had about $3 million in cash
and at least another $1 million in jewelry—the boy’s inheritance.
It was never spoken of again. Paul spent the night alone in the 12-
room apartment.
The next morning, November 29, when Paul awoke around 10,
Harriet had already returned to the apartment.
“Good morning,” she said to Paul. “I’ve notified Jesse Jr.,
Alexander Moore, and Reverend Crossland to meet us at Camp-
bell’s at noon.” Paul just looked at her and nodded in stunned
acquiescence.
From Campbell’s they drove directly to the Ferncliff Cremato-
rium in Hartsdale, New York, where they entered a small, spartan,
furnished room. The casket was removed from the hearse, rolled
into the room, and rested against a wall with floor-to-ceiling black
crepe curtains.
The Reverend Edgar Crossland stood, Bible in hand, and said a
few brief words over the closed casket. Paul and his brother Jesse
sat together by the side of the casket in iron chairs. Across from
them sat Harriet and Moore.
When Reverend Crossland was done, the attendant pulled back
the black floor-to-ceiling curtains to reveal an iron furnace door.
The door was opened, and flames could be seen hissing inside. The
boys were startled and looked at each other. They did not know
what to expect. They all rose as the two attendants grasped the cas-
ket handles and rolled the casket on conveyor wheels through the
open door into the flames.
As the casket hit the flames, they heard a great whoosh. After
the casket was completely inside, the iron door was clanged shut.
Moore, Jesse, and Paul just stood there numb, in stunned, silent
bewilderment. The great Lone Wolf of Wall Street, the Boy
Plunger, was gone forever. He had shot himself just the evening

before, and his body was cremated by noon, with only four peo-
ple to mourn his passing.
Back at the apartment on Park Avenue an hour later, Harriet
talked to Paul. “Here Paul, take this.” She handed him a $20 bill.
He sat dumbfounded. “Your mother called from Brooklyn and
wants you to come over and see her. She wants you to stay with
her. I think it’s a good idea, Paul.”
“All right,” he said.
“Fine. Well, that’s settled. Frank is downstairs waiting with the
car for you.”
She walked him to the door and said goodbye. He went directly
to his mother, Dorothy, who was waiting for him at her home in
Brooklyn. She had not been invited to the funeral, nor had any-
body else. He walked silently into his mother’s open arms. They
cried together. These were the first tears that he had shed.
On February 1, 1941, Livermore’s estate was settled;a report was
published in the New York Times. Harriet Metz Livermore was the
sole executor. The total estate was valued at $10,000 in assets and
$361,010 in liabilities. There was no mention of Livermore’s per-
sonal $1 million trust fund or ofthe money Harriet had taken from
the Park Avenue residence.
Paul went on to finish school at Hotchkiss. He then joined the
Army Air Forces for wartime service. He spoke perfect French, so
he was assigned to train pilots in the Free French air force to fly
P-51 Mustangs. When he got out of the service, he was called by
Harriet to come for a visit. “It is important,” he was told.
When he arrived, Harriet offered to leave him her entire for-
tune if he would just stay with her as a companion. “I’m so
lonely,” she said to him.
Paul refused to give up his life this way. Instead, he went to

Hollywood, where he got roles and acted in several movies and
television series. He later went to Hawaii to surf, where he even-
tually married Margaret Seely, with whom he had two sons, Chad
and Scott. He and Margaret later divorced.
Paul wound up owning the Embers nightclub and restaurant in
Honolulu, where he met and married Ann MacCormack, a beau-
tiful, talented nightclub singer who had sung with Frank Sinatra,
Tony Bennett, and many big bands. They remain happily together.
Jesse’s life was a different story.
Patricia Schneider Freiberg was a tall, slender, blonde beauty,
highly educated, a New York socialite, and the daughter of a
prominent real estate developer in Cincinnati, Ohio.
When she was introduced to Jesse by her friend Timmy Hous-
ton, he whispered to her:“Pat, Jesse Livermore is one of the most
famous playboys in New York. For God’s sake, don’t get involved
with him!”
Patricia ignored her friend’s advice and enjoyed herself as Jesse
swept her off her feet with lavish romantic candlelit dinners in
New York’s finest nightclubs, dining at the best restaurants, trips to
the country, surprise gifts of clothes and jewelry, and the use of the
Livermore name, which still got the best tables in places like the
Plaza Hotel and Sherman Billingsley’s exclusive Stork Club.
Their relationship seemed sealed when Patricia’s black poodle,
Hefner, who had a broken leg and was not a normally friendly
dog, ran down a flight of stairs to meet and greet Jesse, who loved
animals and had a way with them. In particular, he loved Dober-
mans and always had at least one dog.
Jesse was already separated from his first wife, Evelyn Sullivan.
He had a son with her, Jesse III, who was born on December 7,
1941. He rarely saw his son.
Jesse had run the Connecticut Pepsi-Cola franchise his father

had given him into the ground. It finally had to be sold to avoid
bankruptcy. He then convinced Charles Revlon to hire him, and
he eventually became the sales promotion manager for Revlon.
Jesse lived in the Metropolitan Club, an elegant men’s club in
midtown Manhattan. His father had also been a well-known
member. Jesse was a major backgammon and gin player and would
often play through the night, drinking and gambling for high
stakes.
Jesse lived as he was brought up to live. He had no regard for
money. He had always had money, and he believed it would always
be available to him. His father, who made sure Jesse had the finest
cars, the finest clothes, and plenty of spending money, had opened
every door in the country to him. One time Jesse showed his
father his report card from Choate when he had done poorly in
English composition.
“What’s this, son, this poor grade in English comp?” his father
had asked.
“I’m not a very good speller, Dad, that’s the problem.”
“That’s not a problem, son. You’ll always have a secretary. She’ll
do the spelling for you.”
Jesse married Patricia in March 1965. His divorce from Evelyn
Sullivan had cost him his Park Avenue apartment and whatever
cash and assets he had. He was broke except for his trust fund,
which was administrated by his mother, “Mousie,” as he called
her, as his father had. He still had problems with the gunshot
wound. Patricia never knew whether the problems were psycho-
somatic or real. He occasionally complained to her of intense chest
pain, and still had a slight curvature of the spine.
The couple moved into a house at 214 East Seventy-second
Street.
Dorothy, Jesse’s mother, was living in Long Island at Bright
Waters with Willie K. Thompson, her fourth husband. Thompson

was a mob figure. He was directly hooked up with Frank Costello,
a major boss in New York City. When they sold their house on
Long Island, Dorothy called Patricia and Jesse. She asked if it
would be okay if she and Thompson moved into a nearby build-
ing. The couple said okay. Soon after they moved into the build-
ing, Thompson suffered a heart attack and died.
After only a year of marriage, Jesse’s drinking and carousing
increased. His strange relationship with his mother became more
and more intense. His mother still had control of Jesse’s trust fund
and doled the money out to him as she saw fit.
Before he asked for money, usually at dinner, Jesse would often
first feign pain, grabbing his chest, grimacing, moaning, and
slumping forward in his chair. Jesse made sure that his mother
never forgot that she had shot him. Dorothy never failed to give
him the money. When things got especially tight, she would often
give him some pieces from her still-large jewel collection to hock.
They would never be seen again. Dorothy and Jesse had an intense
love/hate relationship. Jesse often stormed out in a rage after his
mother gave him the money.
It was in their second year of marriage that Jesse took up with
other women. He, Dorothy, and Patricia were also imbibing
plenty of alcohol, which did not help the situation. Their house
on East Seventy-second Street had four floors, with the dining
room, living room, and kitchen on the first floor; a library and
bedroom on the second;two bedrooms on the third floor;and two
bedrooms on the fourth floor.
Dorothy moved into the house. Her bedroom was on the third
floor, directly over the library. Patricia and Jesse’s bedroom was
also on the third floor, and William, the live-in butler, had quar-
ters on the fourth floor. There was a spare bedroom on the fourth
floor that eventually became Jesse’s bedroom for his sexual liaisons.

FACING THE GRIM REAPER • 289 •
Things deteriorated fast once Jesse’s affairs came into the pic-
ture. Jesse made no effort to conceal his affairs, once telling Patri-
cia, “It’s no fun having an affair if you aren’t married!”
Jesse got involved with all kinds of women:showgirls, socialites,
hookers, and shop clerks. Eventually he started bringing the
women home and taking them to the bedroom on the fourth
floor, which eventually became his permanent bedroom.
“He’s like a cat with his trophy, dragging those women in here,”
Patricia told Dorothy.
One night Jesse brought home one of his favorites, an English
hooker and frequent visitor, whom he introduced before climbing
the stairs to the fourth floor.
He said, “This is my English friend, Pamela. We are going
upstairs to have a visit.”
As he climbed the stairs, his mother screamed:“I curse my son!
I curse my son! Oh my God!” and she broke down crying in the
living room.
Things eventually turned violent, and Jesse started beating
Patricia. One night he beat her up so badly that the neighbors
called the police. Both of them were drunk when the police came
to the door.
Jesse was fast on his feet. He told the police, “We’ve both been
drinking and I was just restraining her from attacking me.”
“Ma’am, do you want to press charges?”the police asked Patricia.
“No, I just want to go to my sister’s house.” The police helped
her get to her sister’s house.
She was warned to leave him by everyone close to her, but she
could not do it. She loved him no matter what.
Jesse resented his mother more and more. He resented the fact
that she had “pissed away” his real inheritance through her foolish
acts, such as not paying the taxes on the properties; letting her

jewels go for 10 cents on the dollar; converting her $1 million
stock portfolio, handpicked by his father, into railroad bonds that
failed;and generally being whimsical and stupid about money. He
also resented the way she handed out his trust funds to him. His
and his brother’s trust funds had been solidly set up. Every time
Jesse tried to break the trust to get at the principal, he was rebuffed
by his mother and Morgan Guaranty, which administered the trust
strictly according to the dictates of the law and the exacting provi-
sions his father had instructed the attorneys to write into them.
Jesse’s violence increased along with his drinking and carousing.
Patricia gave up drinking in 1967. She believed this saved her life.
One night Jesse came in roaring drunk and found Patricia in the
bathtub. He attacked her, slapping her over and over and then
holding her head underwater with both hands, until she nearly
drowned.
His periods of making up, his self-recriminations when he was
sober, the tears of repentance, his apologies were works of art. He
could be as kind and charming as he was cruel and unfeeling.
Patricia’s love for him was so great that she always forgave him.
When he was sober, they all had plenty of good times. Dinner
parties and meeting in the library every night for cocktails was
often great fun, with lots of laughter and good cheer.
Patricia called her mother-in-law by her nickname, “Mousie.”
She considered her “the funniest woman on the planet, who could
take over any dinner or social occasion. She would light up the
room. And the biggest part of her charm was that she didn’t know
she was being nonstop funny.”
One night Patricia asked Jesse why his father had killed himself.
“Pat, for my father the game was over as he knew it. The play-
ers had changed, the SEC rules had changed, and times had
changed.” He paused, “But maybe it was more than that, maybe
his spirit was broken. Like a dog—you know how you can break

the spirit of a dog, and the dog is no good anymore? Maybe that’s
what happened. He told me once that he only lost money when
he stopped following his own rules.
“I think he had stopped playing the game correctly, and that
bothered him most of all. He was off his form, his mind was fuzzy.
After he divorced Mom and moved out of Evermore, things went
bad for him. It was like she was his good luck, and when she was
gone, his good luck was gone. He had nobody to go to, no friends,
and nowhere to go, no place to get any peace.
“And Nina was a killer bitch. She smothered him, devoured his
spirit with her negativity. I told her to beat it within days of having
to live with her after the shooting. It’s one of the reasons Dad sent
me to Europe and I married Evelyn. I wanted to be on my own.
She hated Paul and me;anything that got between her and Dad, she
hated. She pushed him deeper and deeper into the blackness.”
“What else?” Patricia asked, after a pause.
“Yeah, when Mother shot me I think he began to think his life
was a total failure. How could it be that a mother would shoot her
own son? How the hell could that happen? How could it be his
wife, the beautiful young girl he had married so many years before,
would sink so low as to shoot her own son? A Greek tragedy that
happened to involve him as a principal player.
“And he was with me all the time—by my side through all that
pain and agony when my life was on the line. He must have had
time to think about it. In fact, that was the only time he was really
ever with me for any length of time.
“Finally, I think he just had one of those dark personalities.
There was always something unreachable about him, a kind of
detachment from humanity, from the rest of us. He slipped into
the darkness, and there was nothing to pull him back. His real pas-
sion was the market. When he lost his interest in the market, he
lost it all.”

Patricia was interested in astrology. She had never met Liver-
more, but one day she read his chart. Her conclusions were clear.
He was a very strong Leo, with his planets in Leo. Patricia con-
cluded that he never did it for the money;he did it for the game,
for the sake of winning. And he never wanted to break anyone. He
wanted to best everyone. He wanted world recognition as being
the best there ever was, like a superb athlete who climbs to the
highest level and receives the world’s accolades. Even though he
was not boastful—in fact, he was quiet and secretive—he still
wanted world recognition. He wanted the world to know that he
was the best stock market trader who ever lived. But he wanted the
world to come to this realization on its own. He did not want to
promote it himself.
Near the end of her relationship with Jesse, Patricia’s father, an
Austrian gentleman whom she loved very much, called her to
Cincinnati. He was suffering from the beginning stages of
Alzheimer’s disease. Her parents had been separated for years, but
every Christmas he would show up for dinner.
“Pat,” he said to her, “I don’t ever want your mother to control
my life. It’s something she’s always wanted to do. Promise me you
won’t let her control my life.”
“Daddy, I’ll do everything I can.” Patricia answered.
A month later, her father shot and killed himself. Patricia was
devastated.
Jesse became meaner and meaner. At one time he had two
Dobermans. He and a couple of his neighbors would go for a walk
in Central Park to exercise their dogs. Once in the park, they
would free the dogs to wake up the homeless people who were
sleeping in the park in droves at that time. They would walk down
to the far end of the park and watch as the homeless people
streamed out of the park, screaming, running, and tripping over
each other as they fled, with the dogs in hot pursuit.

By 1975, the violence, drinking, gambling, and womanizing
was out of control.
At 1:15 A.M.on March 23, 1975, Jesse called on one of the three
telephone lines in the house. Unknown to Patricia, Jesse had been
drinking for two days straight.
“Hello, Pat,” he said. “I want you to listen to this.” Jesse went
on to quote Shakespeare for several minutes. Pat could not tell he
was drunk. He spoke clearly. She wondered if he had been smok-
ing pot.
There was a silence on the line, then he said, “Pat I’m going to
kill my dog and then kill myself.”
There was a dead silence on the phone and then a click as the
line went dead. This was not the first time that Pat had heard him
threaten to kill himself. The phone rang a second time. “Pat, you
there?”
“Yes, Jesse. I’m here.”
“I mean it. I’m gonna kill my dog, and then I’m gonna kill
myself.” For the second time there was a click on the phone and
then the buzz of a disconnection.
Two shots rang out in the house. Pat leaped out ofbed and put on
a robe. She was tying the robe when Jesse appeared in her doorway,
a smoking chrome-plated .32-caliber Colt revolver in his hand.
“Cesare is dead. It’s your fault that my dog is dead. Come with
me and bring Alexi.”
Patricia stood dumbfounded, locked in fear. She picked up her
standard white poodle, Alexi, and took the dog in her arms. She
was positive that she and her dog would die that night. Jesse stag-
gered slightly, framed in the door jamb, eyes glazed from drink.
There was no question he was as drunk as a person could be and
still stand.
“You follow me. I’ve been in the library,”he said, and he led the
way down the stairs. The library occupied the second floor. There

was a balcony in front of the library that overlooked the large liv-
ing room downstairs. When Jesse got to the library door and
entered, Pat ran for her life down the stairs to the floor below. She
ran through the kitchen and out the back door, breathing hard,
clinging to Alexi.
In total panic, she ran to the building next door and shoved
Alexi, the frightened poodle, into the arms of the doorman, who
let her use the phone. She called Robert Cohen, the family
lawyer.
“Bobby, it’s Patricia. Jesse’s killed his dog and he wants to kill
me and kill Alexi,” she blurted.
“Where are you?”
“Next door with the doorman. I’m hiding in the lobby. I’m
afraid he’s gonna shoot me through the windows if he gets a
glimpse of me.”
“Stay there. I’ll call the cops and I’ll be there in minutes. Don’t

Cohen and the police arrived simultaneously. The police came
from the Sixty-seventh Street station. The station sent an emer-
gency service special response team of 10 officers led by Lieu-
tenant John Weeks. These officers were specialists in dealing with
dangerous hostage and suicide cases.
Attorney Cohen and Patricia asked to go back into the house
with the police. The police led them into the dining room and
told them to keep out of sight, unless called.
Lieutenant Weeks and Officer Charles Brezny took the lead.
The other officers took up strategic shooting positions. Weeks and
Brezny climbed the stairs to the library. When they reached the
top, they positioned themselves on opposite sides of the door to
the library. They saw Jesse sitting casually in an easy chair, his 85-
pound dog Cesare lying in a pool of blood at his feet. There were
two chrome-plated .32-caliber Colt revolvers in his lap.

Patricia had told the police to be careful, because Jesse was a
deadeye shot. “He must be very drunk to have to use two shots to
kill his dog,” she told them.
Brezny got the nod to try to enter the library. As he passed
through the door, Jesse fired a shot in his direction. The bullet hit
the wall. Brezny darted back outside the doorway.
The officers were well trained, and they did not return fire.
Instead, they talked to him, chit-chatted for an hour, calming him
down. He told them he was going to kill himself. He read to them
from his long suicide note.
After a full hour of chit-chat, Brezny said:“I’m thirsty. I could
use a drink. Could we have a glass of wine?”
“Sure. Sure you can,” Jesse answered.
As he poured the wine, the two police officers rushed him, with
other officers following.
Jesse was able to get one of the guns up from his lap. He
rammed the barrel of the revolver into Lieutenant Weeks’s chest
and pulled the trigger.
The gun only clicked.
The police were instantly on top of him. They subdued him.
Brezny, 29 years old, suffered a broken wrist in the scuffle.
The two guns were confiscated, and Jesse was charged with
attempted murder of a police officer, reckless endangerment, pos-
session of a deadly weapon, resisting arrest, and attempted suicide.
He was in serious trouble. New York Governor Nelson Rock-
efeller had just signed a law mandating life imprisonment for any-
one convicted of attempted murder of a police officer.
The police also explained to Patricia that people who attempt
suicide often want the police to kill them, so they provoke the
police into shooting. It was never explained whether the second
gun, the gun Jesse jammed into Lieutenant Weeks’s ribs, was actu-
ally loaded.

There was no question for Patricia. She believed that Jesse really
did not have the courage to kill himself and had intended to pro-
voke the police into doing the job for him. He was very smart.
Dorothy emerged from her room on the third floor above the
library after Jesse had been taken away. “What happened, Pat?” she
asked, having quietly feigned sleep through the entire incident.
She left for Long Boat Key, Florida, the next day, unable to cope
with the events.
Jesse was arraigned and denied bail. He was taken to Rikers
Island, where he was kept in isolation. His jailers were sure that his
unbridled arrogance would get him killed quickly if he was
allowed to enter the general prison population.
The police had a dilemma:If something happened to Jesse while
he was in jail, it would make headlines. So they came up with the
idea of giving him bail on the proviso that he leave New York and
reside in Florida. “Let him kill a Palm Beach cop—get him out of
New York!” was their attitude. He could come up from Florida
for his trial.
After 54 days in prison, they released him. He looked awful. He
had dropped from a trim 155 pounds to 125. When he had been
arrested, more than 200 people called to inquire about him. When
he was released from Rikers, there were only two. He immediately
started drinking on his release.
As a condition of his bail, he had two weeks to pack up and
leave for Florida. Pat, still afraid for her life, left the house and
stayed with a friend in Pleasant Valley, New York, until he left.
He went down to Palm Beach by himself. As a condition of his
bail agreement, he had to get psychiatric help. His mother called
him and told him not to bother, he was fine.
“You don’t need a psychiatrist, son, you just need some rest.”
Patricia always believed Dorothy said this to her son for selfish

reasons, not wanting him to relive the Santa Barbara shooting as he
got more deeply into therapy.
Therapy was a condition of his bail, however, so he went to a
doctor in Palm Beach. The doctor did all he could, diagnosing
Jesse as a manic-depressive, paranoid, suicidal alcoholic. But he was
dealing with a determined patient.
The trial was postponed each time Jesse came to New York. His
lawyer told him he would beat the rap, but he did not believe it.
On the day before the trial was to begin, Jesse called Patricia from
Palm Beach. “I can’t go to prison, Pat. I just can’t go.”
“Jesse, your lawyer says you can beat it.”
“I don’t believe that moron. I can’t go to jail,” he said, and
hung up.
He went to some friends in Palm Beach, Saint John and Alretta
Terrell, and borrowed a shotgun from them. But he was unable to
use it.
Instead, he opened the oven door and turned on the gas. He took
a handful of pills and collapsed. He was found dead the next day.
Pat flew to Palm Beach immediately, that same afternoon. The
next day, Jesse’s body was quietly taken to a crematorium in Palm
Beach. A minister said a few words, and the body was turned into
ashes. No one was in attendance except Patricia and the minister.
Much later, it dawned on Patricia just how afraid of his mother
Jesse really was. Yet, he stayed so dependent on her for company
and money. His mother knew that he never got over the shooting,
and, no matter what she did, she could never make it up to him.
Somehow they were hooked together, connected by a karmic
umbilical cord that had become inextricably tied when she fired
that shot into his chest.
“What a tragedy! Three lives destroyed in one flash of a gun bar-
rel. What is the matter with us all?” Pat thought to herself.

After Jesse’s death, Dorothy moved back in with Patricia for a
while, but she eventually moved down to Sanibel Island, Florida.
In 1985, Dorothy fell ill, and she called her son Paul and his wife
Ann to come and visit her. Ann and Paul arrived on Sanibel and
found the nurse waiting for them.
“Your mother asked me to come here to the house and wait for
you,” she said.
“Where’s my mother?” Paul asked.
“She went to the hospital two days ago, and I’m sorry to tell you
she passed away that same day,” the nurse said.
“Where is she now?” Ann asked.
“She’s in the mortuary, I’m afraid.” The nurse let a silence fall.
“She left specific instructions to be cremated tomorrow with no
ceremony.”
At that moment, Caesar, Dorothy’s cat, appeared in the living
room and rubbed up against Ann. She picked up the cat, who
was a very old, treasured member of the family. The cat had been
very close to Dorothy. Ann played with the cat as he settled in
her lap.
“Mrs. Livermore, I wouldn’t get too close to the cat if I were
you,” the nurse said.
“Oh?” Ann said.
“Mrs. Livermore left very clear instructions that the cat was to
be placed in the casket and cremated with her.”
Ann gasped and held the cat closer to her. “Paul?” she said,
pleading with her eyes to keep the cat. Paul also wanted to keep
the cat, but he felt obligated to honor his mother’s will.
She had left everything in perfect order—her will, her bank-
books, car keys on the table, written instructions on how to dis-
pose of her estate, and instructions for her funeral. It was unlike
Dorothy to be so organized; in fact, she was famous for being

disorganized and careless. Later, when they moved the dresser,
they found a gold chain and a beautiful watch that had fallen on
the floor.
“She never did keep good track of her jewelry,” Paul said.
“What she had left, you mean,” Ann said.
Over the years, Dorothy had given over $500,000 in jewelry to
her son Jesse, who had hocked it.
The next day, they took the cat to the vet and had him put to
sleep. They drove to the crematorium and placed the cat in the
casket.
Dorothy “Mousie” Livermore entered the flames of eternity
with Caesar the cat to join her husband and son.

• 302 • JESSE LIVERMORE: WORLD’S GREATEST STOCK TRADER
A SUCCESSFUL SPECULATOR REMAINS A CONSTANT STU-
dent of three things:
• Market timing. You must learn when to enter and when to
exit a market trade—when to hold and when to fold, as Ed
Bradley used to say.
• Money management. Don’t lose money, don’t lose your stake.
A speculator without cash is like a storeowner with no inven-
tory. Cash is a speculator’s inventory, lifeline, and best friend.
Without it you’re out of business. Don’t lose your line!
• Emotional control. Before you can successfully play the mar-
ket, you must have a clear, concise strategy and stick to it. All
speculators must design intelligent battle plans, customized to
suit their emotional makeup, before speculating in the stock
market. The biggest thing speculators have to control is their
emotions. Remember, reason, logic, and pure economics do
not drive the stock market. It is driven by human nature,
which never changes. How can it change? It’s our nature.
You can not tell if your judgment about the market is right until
you place a bet, purchase a stock.
If you don’t put your money on the table, you can never test
your judgment, because you can never test your emotions. Liver-
more believed that emotion, not reason, dictates the direction of
the stock market, just as in most important things in life:love, mar-
riage, children, war, sex, crime, passion, religion. It is rarely reason
that drives people.
This is not to say that things like sales, profits, world conditions,
politics, and technology do not play a part in the ultimate price of
a stock. These factors eventually come to bear, and the price of the
stock market and the individual stocks may reflect these factors,
but it is always emotion that carries the extremes.

Livermore believed in cycles, life cycles and market cycles. They
are often extreme, rarely balanced. Cycles come like a series of
ocean waves, bringing the high tide when things are good, and the
low tide as conditions recede. These cycles come unexpectedly,
unpredictably. Good or bad, they have to be weathered with tem-
perance and patience. Remember, the skillful speculator knows
that money can be made no matter what the market conditions, if
a speculator is willing to play both sides of the market.
Livermore realized early on that the stock market is never obvi-
ous. It is designed to fool most of the people most of the time.
Livermore’s rules are often based on thinking against the grain:
• Cut your losses quickly.
• Be sure to confirm your judgment before you take your full
position.
• Let your profits ride ifthere is no good reason to close out the
position.
• The action is with the leading stocks, which change with
every new market.
• Keep the number of stocks you follow limited in order to
focus.
• New all-time highs are to be bought on breakouts.
• Cheap stocks often appear to be bargains after a large drop.
They often continue to fall, or have little potential to rise in
price. Leave them alone!
• Use pivotal points to identify changes in trends and confir-
mations in trends.
• Don’t fight the tape!
The stock market is a study in cycles;when it changes direction,
it remains in that new trend until the momentum weakens—a

body in motion tends to stay in motion. Remember, don’t buck
the trend. Don’t fight the tape.
In a free market system, prices fluctuate. They never go up all
the time, and they never go down all the time. This is good for the
alert speculator, since either side of the market can be played.
MARKET-TIMING RULES
Never sustain a loss of more than 10 percent of your invested cap-
ital. Livermore learned this in the bucket shops, where he worked
with 10 percent margin and was automatically sold out if his loss
exceeded the limit. This is also a money-management rule.
The big money is made by the sitting, not the thinking. Once a
position is taken, the hardest thing to do is to be patient and wait
for the move to play out. The temptation is strong to take fast prof-
its or cover a trade solely out of fear of losing the profit on a cor-
rection. This error has cost millions of speculators millions of
dollars. Be sure you have a good clear reason to enter a trade, and
be sure you have a good clear reason to close your position. It is
the big swing that makes the big money for you.
Play the market only when all factors are in your favor. No one
can play the market all the time and win. There are times when
you should be completely out of the market.
The speculator must know the overall trend of the market—the
line of least resistance—before making a trade. Be sure you know
whether this line of least resistance is upward or downward. This
applies to both the overall market and individual stocks. The basic
thing you need to know before making a trade is which way the
overall market is headed: up, down, or sideways. You have to
decide this before making a trade. If the overall trend of the mar-
ket is not in your favor, you are playing at an extreme disadvantage.

LIVERMORE’S LAWS AND TRADING SECRETS REVEALED • 305 •
Remember, go with the flow, bend with the trend, do not sail into
a gale, and—most of all—don’t argue with the tape!
The only thing to do when you are wrong is to be right by ceas-
ing to be wrong. Cover your losses quickly, without hesitation.
Don’t waste time—when a stock moves below a mental stop, sell
it immediately.
Stocks often act like human beings, expressing different person-
alities:aggressive, reserved, hyper, high-strung, direct, logical, pre-
dictable, unpredictable. Study the stocks as you would study
people; after awhile, their reactions to certain circumstances
become predictable and useful in timing the stock’s movement.
Stocks are never too high to begin buying or too low to begin
selling short.
Failure to take the opportunity to get out of large illiquid posi-
tions when the opportunity presents itself can cost you dearly.
Failure to take advantage of a serendipitous act of good luck in
the stock market is always a mistake.
In a market moving sideways in a narrow channel where stock
prices are essentially stagnant, there is a great danger in trying to
predict or anticipate when and in what direction the market will
move. You must wait until the market or the stock breaks out of
this sideways channel in either direction. Don’t anticipate! Wait for
confirmation! Never argue with the tape. Follow the line of least
resistance.
Do not spend a lot of time trying to figure out what moves the
price of a particular stock. Rather, examine the tape. The answer
lies in what the tape says, not in trying to figure out why the tape
is saying it. Behind all major movements in the stock market
there is an irresistible force which will most likely be revealed
later. This is all the successful speculator needs to know.
The stock market goes up, down, and sideways. You can make
money on the up side or the down side—you can buy long or sell

short. It should not matter to you what side of the market you are
on. You must be impersonal. When the market goes sideways and
you are confused, take a vacation.
A danger signal to watch out for:the one-day reversal, when the
high of the day is higher than the high of the previous day, but the
close of the day is below the low of the previous day, and the vol-
ume of the current day is higher than the volume of the previous
day. Beware!
If the stock you traded is going in the opposite direction from
what you expected, sell it quickly. This means your judgment was
wrong. Cut your losses.
Wait, be patient, until as many factors as possible are in your
favor. It’s the patience that makes the money.
Study the action of a stock that has made a severe break in price,
a precipitous drop. If the stock does not rebound quickly, it will
most likely fall away further. There is an inherent weakness in this
stock;the reason will be revealed at a later time.
The market is operating in future time. It has usually already
factored in current events.
It is the inception of a basic movement, the pivotal point, a
change in trend, which indicates whether to buy or sell. It is this
change in trend that, if caught, yields the most rewards.
There are two kinds of pivotal points. The reversal pivotal
point is defined as the perfect psychological time at the begin-
ning of a major market move, a change in basic trend. It does not
matter if this is at the bottom or the top of a long-term trending
move.
The second pivotal point is called the continuation pivotal point.
The reversal pivotal point marks a definite change in direction;the
continuation pivotal point confirms it.
Be alert—major pivotal points can often be accompanied by a
heavy increase in volume.

LIVERMORE’S LAWS AND TRADING SECRETS REVEALED • 307 •
Pivotal points provide an essential timing device, a trigger that
reveals when to enter and when to exit the market.
At the end of a bull market, watch for wild capitalization—good
stocks selling at 30, 40, 50, or 60 times their annual earnings. These
will be the same stocks that had previously traded at much lower
multiples.
Beware ofwild speculative stocks that take offfor no real reason,
except that they are trendy, currently favored stocks.
New highs are very important for timing. A new all-time high
can mean that the stock has broken through the overhead supply
of stock, and the line of least resistance will be strongly upward.
Many people, when they see that a stock has made a new high, sell
it immediately, then go to look for a cheaper stock.
Group actionis the key to timing your move. Stocks do not move
alone when they move. If U.S. Steel climbs or drops in price, then
sooner or later, Bethlehem, Republic, and Crucible will follow
along. The premise is simple:If the basic reasons why U.S. Steel’s
business should come into or go out of favor in the stock market
are sound, then the rest of the steel group should also follow for
the same reasons.
Trade the leading stocks in the leading groups. Buy the market
leader of an industry group.
Watch the market leaders, the stocks that have led the charge
upward in a bull market. When these stocks falter and fail to make
new highs, it is often a signal that the market is turning. As the
leaders go, so goes the entire market.
Confine your studies of stock market movements to the promi-
nent leaders of the day. If you cannot make money out of the lead-
ing active issues, you are not going to make money out of the
stock market. That is where the action is and where the money is
to be made. It also keeps your universe of stocks limited, focused,
and more easily controlled.

You should have a clear target price at which to sell if the stock
moves against you, a firm stop. And you must obey your rules!
A successful market trader must bet only on the course of high-
est probabilities. Buy small positions, and probe to test your judg-
ment before you commit to a large position. Do not establish your
full position all at one time. Use probes to confirm your judgment
and timing, and to find the line of least resistance.
The trader must react quickly to the unexpected. If it is a wind-
fall, grab it. If it is bad news, hit the road, and don’t look back or
hesitate—sell out the position.
Beware when volume gets heavy and stocks churn after a long
upward trend. This is a clue, a warning that the end of the move is
near. This is an indication that stocks are going from strong hands
to weak hands, from the professionals to the public. The public
often views this heavy volume as the mark of a vibrant, healthy
market going through a normal correction, not a top or a bottom.
The public tends to believe that the insiders are feeding out
their stock on the upward rise of a stock. They are often wrong.
They are often being fed the majority of the insider or pooled
stock after the stock has crested at new highs and is rolling over,
churning, and starting its decline. This is the time of the highest
volume. This is often the reason why a stock cannot make a new
high—there is simply too much supply hanging over the market.
This is distribution—is not always from insiders, but usually from
larger shareholders, such as mutual funds in today’s markets.
MONEY-MANAGEMENT RULES
Establish stops! You should have a clear target price at which to sell
if the stock moves against you. And you must obey your rules!
Never sustain a loss of more than 10 percent of your invested cap-

ital. Losses can be twice as expensive to make up—if you lose 50
percent, you must gain 100 percent to get even (see Table 12.1).
This is also a key timing rule.
Never meet a margin call, and never average down in your
buying.
Turn paper profits into real money periodically. Take a percent-
age of your winnings and put them in a safe place, like the bank,
or bonds, or an annuity. Cash was, is, and always will be king.
Always have cash in reserve. Cash is your ammunition. Livermore’s
biggest mistake was not following this rule more often.
Examine and understand the dimension of time: Time is not
money, because there may be times when your money should be
inactive. Time is time, and money is money. The successful
investor is not invested in the market all the time. There are many
times when you should be completely in cash. Often, money that
is just sitting can later be moved into the right situation once it has
revealed itself. If you are unsure of the direction of the market,
then stay out, and wait for a confirmation of the next move. This
is how to make a fortune. Patience, patience, patience is the key to
success. Don’t be in a hurry.
Take some winnings off the table after the completion of a suc-
cessful trade.
Use probes to establish your full position. After an initial probe,
do not make a second move until the first probe shows you a
profit. Do not establish your full position all at once—wait until
your first trades, your early probes, have shown you a profit, then
go ahead and fill out your full position.
To be precise:First establish 20 percent of your planned position
on the first purchase, 20 percent on the second, and 20 percent on
the third. Wait for a confirmation of your judgment, then make
your final purchase of 40 percent.
Each ofthese purchases, or probes, is a crucial factor in establishing

your overall position. Ifat any time the stock moves against you, close
out all your positions, never sustaining a loss ofmore than 10 percent
of invested capital.
Sell the losers;let the winners ride, provided all the factors are
positive.
EMOTIONAL-CONTROL RULES
Emotional control is the most essential factor in playing the market.
Don’t anticipate! Wait until the market gives you the clues, the
signals, the hints, before you move. Move only after you have con-
firmation. Anticipation is a killer. Don’t make a decision based on
anticipation. The market always gives you time. If you wait for the
clues, there will be plenty of time to execute your moves.
Do not spend a lot of time trying to figure out why the price of
a particular stock moves. Rather, examine the facts themselves.
The answer lies in what the tape says, not in trying to figure out
why. Most important, never argue with the tape. It can’t hear you.
Stock traders can be convinced to move away from their own
convictions by listening to the advice of other traders, persuaded
that their judgment may be faulty. Or, in the least damaging case,
listening to others may cause indecision and bad judgment. This
indecision may cause a loss of confidence, which may well mean a
loss of money.
“Tips come from all sources—from relatives, loved ones, friends
who have just made serious investments themselves and want to
pass on their good fortune. They also come from hucksters and
criminals. Remember: All tips are dangerous. None should be
taken.
Remove hope from your trading lexicon. Hoping a stock will do
something is truly gambling. If you do not have good, solid reasons

for holding a stock position, then move on to another more logical
trade. Wishing a stock up or down has caused the downfall ofmany
stock market speculators. Hope walks hand in hand with greed.
Be aware of your emotions at all times. Don’t get too confident
over your wins or too despondent over your losses.
Nothing ever changes in the market. The only thing that
changes are the players, and the new players have no financial
memory of the previous major cycles—like the panic of 1907 or
the crash of 1929—because they have not experienced them. It
may be new to the speculator, but it’s not new to the market.
Always have a method of speculating, a plan of attack. And
always stick to your plan. Do not constantly change your plan.
Find a method that works emotionally for you, and stick to that
method. Stick to your own customized game.
Speculators are not investors. Their object is not to secure a
steady return on their money over a long period of time. Specula-
tors must profit by either a rise or a fall in the price of whatever
they have decided to speculate in.
Play a lone hand. Make your decisions about your own money
by yourself. Be secretive and silent in your stock trading. Do not
disclose your winners or your losers.
The successful investor is not invested in the market all the time.
There are many times when you should be completely in cash. If
you are unsure of the direction of the market, wait.
Never lose control of your emotions when the market moves
against you. And never become elated with your successes to such
a degree that you think the market is an easy way to make money.
Never fight the tape; the tape is the truth. Seek harmony with
the tape.
Stay in the business you’re good at.
It takes four strong mental characteristics to be a superior mar-
ket trader:

• Observation—The ability to observe the facts without preju-
dice
• Memory—The ability to remember key events correctly and
objectively
• Mathematics—The ability to calculate numbers easily;being at
home with digits
• Experience—The ability to learn, to retain knowledge gained
through experience and call upon it at will
Subliminal messages, apparent impulses, are nothing more than
the subconscious mind talking to you, calling up years of trading
experiences. On occasion, Livermore let his inner mind lead him,
even if he did not know the reason at the time. He agreed with
Aristotle:“We are the sum total of our experience.”
Emotions must be understood and harnessed before successful
speculation is possible:
• Greed is a human emotion present in all people, defined by
Webster’s dictionary as the excessive desire for acquiring or
possessing;a desire for more than one needs or deserves. We
do not know the origin of greed, all we know is that it exists
in every person.
• Fear lies ready to appear in a single heartbeat, and when it
does, it distorts reason. Reasonable people act unreasonably
when they are afraid. And they become afraid every time they
start to lose money. Their judgment becomes impaired.
• Hope lives hand in hand with greed when it comes to the
stock market. Once a trade is made, hope springs alive. It is
human nature to be hopeful, to be positive, to hope for the
best. Hope is important to the survival of the human species.
But hope, like its stock market cousins ignorance, greed, and

fear, distorts reason. Hope clouds facts, and the stock market
only deals in facts. It is like the spinning of a roulette wheel—
the little black ball tells the outcome, not greed, fear, or hope.
The result is objective and final, with no appeal.
Beware of ignorance. The market must be studied and learned,
not in a casual fashion but seriously and deeply. The stock market,
with its allure of easy money and fast action, induces people into
the foolish mishandling of their money like no other entity. The
reverse of ignorance is knowledge, and knowledge is power.
The stock market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of
the people most of the time. These rules are often based on think-
ing against the grain.
You should not be in the market all the time. There are times
when you should be out of the market, for emotional as well as
economic reasons.
When the tape doesn’t agree with your decision to buy or sell,
wait until it does. Never try to rationalize your position with what
the tape is saying.
Do not give or receive stock tips;just remember:In a bull mar-
ket stocks go up, in a bear market they go down. This is all anyone
needs to know, or all you need to tell them.
Stock speculators sometimes make mistakes, and know that they
are making them, but proceed anyway, only to berate themselves
later for breaking their own rules. Do not break your rules.
Never become an involuntary investor by holding a declining
stock.
Never think about buying a stock on reactions, or shorting a
stock on rallies.
Do not use the words bullish or bearish. These words fix a firm
market direction in the mind for an extended period of time.

Instead use upward trend and downward trend when asked the direc-
tion you think the market is headed. Simply say:The line of least
resistance is upward, or downward, at this time.
Speculation is a business, and like any other business it takes
hard work and diligence to succeed.
CONCLUSION
There is nothing new on Wall Street or in stock speculation. What has hap-
pened in the past will happen again and again and again. This is because
human nature does not change, and it is human emotion that always gets
in the way of human intelligence.
