The COT—Assorted
History
“Look,” began the spokesman when the door closed, “the Grain Fu-
tures Administration has made a complaint that you are carrying
too much open stuff.” It would be hard for me to make anyone other
than a La Salle Street trader understand how I felt then, unless it
might be some Russian farmer who has tasted the bitter flavor of
governmentinterferenceinmatterswhichshouldnotconcernit.

THE GRAIN FUTURES ADMINISTRATION
Congress, which was dominated by farm-state members, was quick to respond to the
crisis, passing the Grain Futures Act, signed by President Warren G. Harding in 1922.

4 COTTHEORY
The act, for the first time, required Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) members to
reporttheiraggregate tradestothenewly formedGrainFuturesAdministration, which
posted these figures in its first annual report to Congress in 1924. From the beginning,
a key feature of the report was to differentiate speculators from the “trade” (commer-
cialhedgerswhousedfuturesmarketstoprotecttheirongoingcashbusinessfromprice
volatility).
In response, the Chicago grain traders first sued (unsuccessfully) to maintain their
tradingprivacy,andthenformedtheBoardofTradeClearingCorporationin1925(now
the Clearing Corporation) to provide trader anonymity in aggregating and reporting
trades.Eventhoughpositionsizeswereonlyinformallycontrolled(bytheCBOT’sBusi-
nessConductCommittee),largetraderslikeArthurCutten—whoby1926tookdelivery
of5millionbushelsofwheat—werecontemptuousofgovernmentoversight,anattitude
thatcontinuesamongcertainlargetraderstothisday.
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE AUTHORITY
Monthly reporting continued under the Commodity Exchange Authority (CEA), cre-
ated by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936. This act empowered the CEA to es-
tablish speculative position size limits as well as prosecute market manipulators,
and banned option trading on commodities—a restriction that was not lifted until
1982. This act, and subsequent amendments, added markets to the CEA’s portfolio
(Table1.1).
In 1942, the “Commodity Futures Statistics” report was published separately from
theU.S.DepartmentofAgriculture’sUSDAannualreport.Thenewpublicationincluded
monthly trader statistics (though still published annually). The CEA published the first
monthlyCommitmentsofTraders(COT)reportonJuly13,1962.Thislistedlargetrader

TheCOT—AssortedHistory 5
THE COMMODITY FUTURES
TRADING COMMISSION
Congress created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to succeed the
CEA in 1974. By this time, several additions were made to the COT (Commitments)
report, including adding data on the numbers of traders in each category; a new-crop,
old-crop breakout; and concentration ratios that show the percentage of open interest
heldbythefourandeightlargesttraders.UndertheCFTC,theCOTreportreleaseinter-
valhasbeenincrementallyshortenedbeginningin1990withmid-monthandmonth-end
reports, to every two weeks beginning in 1992, and to the current weekly schedule in
2000.Thedelaybetweentabulationandreleasehasbeenshortened,aswell,andyoucan
now collect the data at the CFTC’s website at 3:30 P.M. eastern time each Friday (from
tabulationsmadeonTuesday’sclose).
Byappearances, theCommitmentsreportislittlechanged duringitsfirst45years,
but looks, as they say, can be deceiving. Although the format available at the CFTC’s
websiteisverysimilartothepre-1982report(Figure1.1),numeroussubtlechangeshave
affectedboththenatureofthelargetrader reportedandtheanalysisofthereport.You
willnotfindaquizattheendofthischapter,butIwillhighlighttheevolvingnatureofthe
COTreportsothatyoucanappreciatehowearlierauthorsmayhaveofferedadifferent
takeonanalyzingthereport’scontents.
I first became aware of the COT report soon after beginning my trading career. My
choice to trade commodities was really a matter of timing. In 1973, when I became in-
terestedininvesting,stockswerelockedintheirworstbearmarketsincetheGreatDe-
pression. After studying all of the various investment possibilities covered by Morton
Schulman’sAnyone Can Still Make a $Million(Schulman1973),Isettledoncommodi-
ties.Iwentlongthreesilvercontractsat$3.97andmade$1,500myfirstweek.IguessI
willneverforgetmyfather’sresponse,“That’saprettygoodlivingifyoucandoitevery
week.”
Therewerenotalotofcommoditybooksinprintinthosedays,soIdoveintoLarry
Williams’s How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities, when
it was published (Williams 1974). One of his key resources was something called the
CommitmentsofTradersreport,soIimmediatelysubscribed.Itwasafreesubscription
in those days, with separate reports mailed from Chicago and New York on about the
11thofeachmonth,coveringthepreviousmonth’strading.
You undoubtedly have heard the old market saying that the easiest way to make
a small fortune trading commodities is to start with a large fortune. Larry’s contention
wasthattradersbecamelargebyanticipatingmarketmoves.I’moversimplifyingLarry’s
techniques when I tell you that he recommended using the COT report “to alert you to
the‘deals’youshouldbescoutingout”(p.96)bycomparingthesizeoflargespeculator
longpositionstotheirshortholdings.Iflargenoncommercialsareoverwhelminglylong,
look for a long trade; look togo short if large speculators are net short. He specifically
warnedagainstusingtheCommitmentsreportfortradetiming—understandable,since
itwasamonthlyreportthatreachedyouhalfwaythroughthefollowingmonth.

THE MODERN COT DATA
Duringthe1970s,thelargenoncommercialcategorywasmostlikelydominatedbylarge
individuals a` la Richard Dennis of Turtles fame. In the 1980s, this began to change as
commodityfundsgainedpopularity(includingseveralthatwererunbyformerTurtles).
So, too, did the interpretation of large speculator positions. In 1982, the CFTC stopped
requiring large traders to report their own positions (on Series ’03 forms). Their stated
intent was to improve efficiency and the timeliness of the COT report by eliminating

reliance on a form that was typically sent by mail. The new routine relied primarily on
Series ’01 reports of large traders’ positions filed on a next-morning basis by Futures
CommissionMerchants(FCMorbroker)togetherwithForm102,whichidentifiedlarge
traderswhoheldaccountswithmultipleFCMs.Notably,largetraderswererequiredto
file Form 40, and Schedule 1, identifying any positions used for hedging purposes. The
dailyreportsbythebrokersprovidedthecriticalinformationonactualtradingpositions.
There is a bit of a dispute over why the CFTC ceased publishing the report in
1982. The Commission maintains today that it suspended publication “in order to im-
plement computer changes.” Commodities (now Futures) magazine reported in 1983
that “the CFTC stopped handing out the free, photocopied booklets when production
costssoared”(CommoditiesDecember1983).Nobodyseemstodisputethemagazine’s
accountthatthereportwasreintroducedinDecember1982,“afteradelugeofrequests
for the publication” (1983). Adding to Commodities’ credibility, the COT reports were
reintroducedaspaidsubscriptions,pricedat$0.10perpage(about$5.80fortheChicago
report,and$2.30forNewYork’s).
Thecombinationofthepublishinggap,thechangesinthereportingregimen,andthe

worked around, and the money still flows to the futures markets through the swap

Goose: Let’emeatpotatoes.
When grain prices went through the roof, the public began to call “fowl,” so the
commissar relented and agreed to separate counts of geese and ducks. But when he
got the ducks all in a row, he found that they were outnumbered by geese! The geese
squawked when told they would be ratted out, so the commissar agreed to count only
thewhitegeese.“Iwilljustsaythatseparatingthegraygeesefromthegrayduckswould

the trader holding it, should be classified for COT purposes. In other words, if
an entity holding a particular futures or option position has received a hedge

“commercialenterprise”(CFTC,FederalRegister,June21,2006).

The 1981 format was retained when the modern report was reintroduced in 1983.
Figure 2.1 shows the current Long Form taken from the CFTC’s website. It is virtually
indistinguishablefromthe1981version(covershowninFigure1.1ofthepreviouschap-

market transparency as the COT reportsprovide, the CFTC has anoverriding policy to
withhold information that could be used to manipulate markets, or to identify individ-
ual participants. (Removing markets with fewer than 20 large traders is an example of
thelatter.)

Playing the Numbers
The COT Long Form comprises four sections, each broken into three lines for “All,”
“Old,” and “Other” (crop years). Reportable (large trader positions) are listed on the
left, with the remainder of open interest—small traders—listed as “non-reporting” and
shownontheright-handsideofthereport.Largetraderpositionsareclassifiedaseither

Thetopsectionofthereport(Figure2.2)carriestherawpositions,labeledaseither

The breakdown of open interest between “old crop” and “other” may carry mean-
ingifyouareacommercialinthetrade;forspeculators,notsomuch.Ofallthefigures
presented on this Long Form, you will find that most of the focus of this book is con-
centrated on the numbers circled in Figure 2.1—the outright long and short totals for
the two large trader groups. Be careful in using the totals for all large traders, as these
includethespreading(addedtoboththelongtotalandtheshorttotal).
In the Options and Futures Combined report, traders’ option positions are com-

short call and long put open interest are converted to short futures-equivalent posi-

The spreading figure represents the extent to which each large speculator holds
equal long and short positions. (That seems easy enough.) Any excess is listed as ei-
thershortorlong,asappropriate.Forexample,ifalargespeculatorislong1,000nearby
Eurodollarcontractsandsimultaneouslyshort1,500ofalaterdelivery,1,000willbecar-
ried under the spreading category, with the remaining 500 unmatched contracts listed
intheShortcolumn.(Well, this much makes sense.)However,thespreadingfiguresdo
notincludeintermarketspreading,suchasspreadingEurodollarfuturesagainstT-note
futures.(Okay.)
For the “old” and “other” crop-year figures, spreading is calculated for equal long
andshortpositionswithinthesamecropyear.Ifaspeculativefundholdsalongposition
in an old crop future and an equal short position in an “other” crop-year, each position
will be listed separately in its respective “Long” or “Short” column (and is not listed as
“spreading”). For this reason, and I quote from the CFTC’s Backgrounder here, “sum-
mingthe‘old’and‘other’figuresforlong-only,forshort-only,orfor‘spreading’willnot
necessarilyequalthecorrespondingfigureshownfor‘all’futures.Anydifferencesresult
from traders that spread from an ‘old’ crop-year future to an ‘other’ crop-year future”
(CFTCBackgrounder2007).(Fromhere,youareonyourowntryingtomakesenseof

AndtheNon-Commercialoldcroplongtotalof93,140is20.7percentofthetotaloldcrop

total is included in the calculations. In other words, the long percentages across a row
will sum to 100 percent less the spreading percentage. An example of why this can be
problematic is shown in Figure 5.6. (See Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the

Obviously the open interest totals increase when you add the options equivalent posi-

small differences between the two reports. My preference for using the Options and

on a nominal basis). This dispute was touched on in Chapter 1. Although the resulting

over market volatility. If so, it replicates their pattern of the late 1980s, when commer-

THE REPORTING SYSTEM
The CFTC’s large trader reporting system was described in Chapter 1. The electronic
reports from brokers are the basis of the weekly Commitments reports. Depending on
the report, large traders are broken down into either two or three categories. For the
Futures OnlyandOptionsandFutures Combinedreports,theseare“commercial”and
“non-commercials”; the COT-Supplemental—added in 2007—pulls out a third category
of “commodity index traders,” whose numbers are drawn primarily from the “commer-
cial”categoryintheCombinedreport.
Youneedtobealittlecarefulaboutrelyingonpressreportsconcerninglargetrader

categoriesarelargetraders.Inthisbook,Iwillrefertolargenoncommercialsas“large

or,whereneededforclarity,as“hedgers,”todistinguishthemfromindextraders.
AnotherconfusionarisesoverthedifferencebetweentheCOTdataandtheChicago
Board of Trade’s Liquidity Data Bank. The CBOT data, which is available intraday, is
based on volume. The COT is open interest. The CBOT does not separate traders be-
tweenspeculativeandcommercial,butbetweenthreelevelsofexchangemembersand
everybodyelse.TheCBOTdatareportsvolumeatcertainpricelevels,butdoesnottell
youwhoistakingwhichsideofthetrade,anddoesnottieouttotheopenpositionsat

COMMERCIAL HEDGERS
AsIalludedtoatthebeginningofthischapter,thecommoditymarketswerecreatedby
and for commercials, a small point perhaps, but one to be mindful of. They control the
overwhelmingmajorityoftheopeninterestinmostmarkets.InFigure3.1,theOptions

vantagesoverothertraders.
First, traditional commercials (hedgers) can generally be expected to hold an in-
formationaladvantage overotherplayers. Thesefirmshavelong-standing relationships
within, and an understanding of their industry, bred of decades or centuries of dealing
inthecashbusiness.Theymaintaintheirownnetworksofcorrespondentsupanddown
thesupplychain.Muchofwhatpassesasfundamentalnewsoriginateswithcommercial
houses.Evengrantingthepossibilitythatfundamentaldevelopmentsareaccuratelyand
completely conveyed to the public, you would assume that commercials have already
actedontheinformationbeforedisseminatingit.Whilewemaynotbeabletoovercome
thisinformationaledge,theCommitmentsreportdoesservetoleveltheplayingfield,if
youknowwhattolookfor(andhowtointerpretit).
Secondly, large commercials have deep pockets, which afford them a distinct ad-
vantage.Theyareabletodealwhentheyviewpricesasfavorable,towithstandadverse

theiradvantage.(Runningstopsmightbeanexample.)Insomemarkets,thispowercan
beconcentratedinthehandsofjustafewplayers.Ifdeeppocketsdidnotaffordenough
advantage, commercials operate with the safety net of an offsetting cash position. In a
perfect hedge, losses on a futures position are offset by equivalent inventory gains. Of
course,somecommercialsviewthehedgingdepartmentasaprofitcenterandutilizethe
offsettingcashpositionasstayingpower,helpingmarketsalongwhenthetimecomes.
Although you need to be mindful of the commercial trading edge, it is essential to
appreciatethatcommercialshortsandcommerciallongsarenot(usually)thesameenti-
ties,nordotheysharethesamehedginggoals.Bydefinition,commercialsmustdemon-
stratethattheyarehedgingalegitimateriskthatisdirectlyconnectedtothemarketthey
are trading. This implies a one-way price risk and means that although they may play
from either the short or long side, they cannot hedge in both. (A firm may be catego-
rizedasahedgerinsomemarketsandanoncommercialinothermarkets,however.)So,
despitesomesharedtradingedges,commercialsarenotahomogeneousgroup.
Commercial shorts are producers who sell forward production in futures, with the
intent of locking in currently quoted selling prices. Commercial longs, as users of the
product, are the producer’s customers, who buy forward futures contracts in order to
fix future inventory costs. A couple of simplified examples will help illustrate the key
differencesbetweencommercialproducersandusers.

Theclassificationoflargespeculatorincludesseveralvariationsof“funds”illustrat-
ing how difficult it is to take inventory of this community. In 2003 the CFTC cross-
referenced Institutional Investor’s “Platinum List of the 100 Largest Hedge Funds”
against their own records and those of the National Futures Association (NFA). They
foundthat65ofthePlatinum100hedgefundswereregisteredasCommodityPoolOper-
ators (CPOs) and 50 were registered as Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) (Brown-
Hruska 2004). The noncommercial category in the COT report, then, includes hedge

COMMODITY INDEX TRADERS
AsImentionedinChapter1,theCFTCbeganseparatingoutlong-onlycommodityindex
tradersinthenewCOT-SupplementalreportinJanuary2007.Theearlyreportsshowed
total CIT commodity “investments” of about $33 billion, for the 12 markets reported.
(See Chapter 20 for a further breakdown.) Since these markets represent 17 percent
of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) weighting, extrapolating out suggests
that CIT positions in U.S. futures markets in early 2007 totaled, perhaps, $165 billion.

One of the potential pitfalls in labeling the small trader category as a good fade is
that it is even a more diverse group than the large hedger group. It includes commer-
cials of both stripes, producers and users, as well as speculators. Small traders then,
areamixedbag,whosetradingtendenciesaredifficulttogeneralize.Theirstyleoftrad-
ing(andapparentdegreeofsuccess)variesconsiderablybetweenmarketsandbetween
time periods. This is most likely due to differing mixes of commercials versus specula-
torsbymarket—and,perhaps,dependingontheprevailingpricetrend.Duetothelarge
variabilityinsmalltraderperformanceandthesmallvariabilityincommodityindexfund
positions, this book focuses on understanding the two most informative trader groups:
commercialsandfunds.
Since traders are not identifiable by name, it is unwise to be dogmatic in describ-
ingtheirmotivesinallmarketconditions.Myintentionistoprovideageneralframeof

Since commodity index traders are almost all long-only players, those waiting for
them to move net short as a bearish sign will have a long wait. Like the other trader
groups, the index players’ positions must be measured against the range of their net
(long) totals. Even this rule must be qualified, because these investment vehicles are
verynew,andmuchofthegrowthintheirfuturespositionsmustbeattributedtonovelty
and promotion. It remains to be seen how these “long-term” investors will react to a
commoditybearmarket,butwearenotlikelytoseeCITsnetshort!
TIP: ALWAYS FADE THE SMALL SPECULATOR
Thishastobeagimme,right?Althoughtheexpertsmayargueonwhetherthenumber
is 80 or 90 percent, every market book is unequivocal in stating that small speculators
are net losers. I cannot argue with this premise. My only reservation is in your abil-
ity to find out what small speculators are buying or selling, or how much. The CFTC
does not release this information; it is not included in any of the Commitments of
Tradersreports.
“Now who is pulling whose leg?” I can hear you say. “Are we reading the same re-
port?”Ifwearelookingatthecategoryofficiallylistedunderthecolumnheading“NON-
REPORTABLEPOSITIONS”(right-handcolumnofFigure4.2),wearetalkingaboutthe
SmallTradergroup.ThesearesimplytraderswhosepositionsarebelowtheCFTC’sdes-
ignated reporting levels. Thus, the group includes small commercial hedgers as well as
small speculators—a critical, frequently overlooked nuance. The presence of commer-
cial hedgers makes categorizing problematic. The small speculator may be the “dumb
money,”butheisnotstupidenoughtocomeoutfromhidingamongcommercialsinthe
smalltradercategory.
TIP: IT IS ONLY LOGICAL TO COMPARE HEDGING
TO THE SEASONAL AVERAGE
This bit of logic was reported in 1985 in an authoritative industry yearbook (Jiler 1985,
50T), along with a compelling set of seasonal net position charts. This study and its
follow-up a few years later (Shaleen 1996, 17T) have been cited by enough subsequent
futures market books to give legitimacy to the seasonal analysis of COT data. I grant
you that it may be logical to assume that commercial producers and users, at least in
agriculturalmarkets,havehedgingrequirementsthatmightchangewiththeseasons.
SeasonalchartsareeasilyassembledfromweeklyCOTdata;justsumthenetposi-
tions by week and divide by the number of years. Figure 4.4 shows a very official and

OPEN INTEREST
Open interest is the total number of open contracts at the close of trading. That is, the
total number of longs or the total number of shorts, not the combined total. Futures
markets are zero sum. This means that each contract must have both a buyer and a
seller. Open interest will increase by 1 when a new buyer buys from a new seller. This

Commodity and hedge funds are notorious momentum traders, a reputation borne out
bytheCOTdata.InFigure5.7,thelargespeculatorweeklynetpositionischartedinthe
lower chart window. The upper window is a graph of closing prices for each Tuesday,
the day the CFTC normally tabulates large trader positions. Tuesday closes are plotted
in place of Friday’s to match changes in net positions to the price action. This is for
analysis purposes only; the CFTC data is not actually available until Friday afternoon.

COMMERCIAL PATTERNS
Based on the mirror image noted between the two large trader net position patterns,
it does not take an expert to surmise that the interpretation of the commercial net po-
sition is just the inverse of the fund net position. Because the fund net positions tend
to track price—and the commercial net position typically mirrors the funds’ trading
patterns (Figures 5.3 and 5.4)—you might expect to also see a mirror image relation-
shipbetweencommercialnetpositionsandprices.Excellentobservation;youarelargely

The typical commercial trading pattern is to average down (or up, in the case of
an up-trending market). This is a strategy that suits commercials in several regards.
First, it helps offset the effects of fund momentum trading, keeping market trends or-
derly. Secondly, this strategy ensures increased hedge protection as the market moves
further against their position. Third, their buy-on-weakness, sell-on-strength strategy
meansthattheirmaximumexposureoccursatmarketturns.Sounlikefunds,commer-

that reflected commercial scale-down buying, as prices fell in early 2003 (arrow). This
buying raised their net position into net long territory, and finally overcame specula-
tive selling pressure in March, placing a floor under prices for nearly four months. At
point X the pattern changed. Commercial buying came in as usual when prices weak-
ened, but there was no price bounce; OJ prices sank in the face of steady commer-
cial buying support. So commercials began liquidating longs and adding shorts on a
scale down, plunging prices ahead of them. Instead of mirroring prices, their net posi-
tion tracked prices. Their momentum selling helped drive OJ prices down 35 percent
over the next 10 months. When commercial buying fails to support prices, it is not un-

While there may be a majority of producers in the market, the COT Index is sensitive
to the degree of bearishness among commercials. Assuming for a moment that users
hold a constant number of long contracts, if producers lift short hedges, the COT will
rise. If enough hedges are lifted, the COT will reach the maximum bullish reading of

INTERPRETING THE COT INDEX
How is the COT used in trading? Although I contend the COT Index is not a timing in-
dicator, the index has frequently made a liar of me. The commercial COT Index is of-
ten used as a trade alert, or trade setup. For instance, if you are following a technical
method or advisory, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the volume of trading signals and
numbers of issues, whether trading futures, ETFs, or sector funds. COT Index signals
can be used as a screen. If a valid commercial buy signal is registered, you might then
go to the technical method to see if a long trade signal is available. Since commercials
typicallyarecounter-trendtraders,youwouldbebottom-pickingbyusingtheCOTsig-
nal alone, so it might be wise to pair it with a break-out type of trigger. The technical
trigger ensures that you are entering with prices moving your way, while the COT In-
dex has provided an indication of an extreme in trader sentiment that could foster a
bigmove.
WhatisaCOTsignal?ThecommercialCOTIndexisprobablythemostpopularCom-
mitmentsindicator.(Thismaybedue,insomemeasure,toarticlesIwroteforBarron’s,
Futures Magazine,andStocks and Commoditiesbetween1990and1994.Thiswasthe

Downtrends
Downtrends are the time to pay attention to COT sell signals. And COT buy signals?
Not so much. Moving ahead in time on the British pound futures chart (Figure 6.8), an
important market top developed in October 1999 (point 1). Commercial selling at this
levelpushedtheCOTIndexbelowthe5percentsellsignalthresholdfourweeksrunning,
andthetrendbegantoreverse.
Then in January 2000, a rebound threatened the market top (3). The rally attempt
was met, once again, with commercial selling, which was able to turn back the threat.

The previous two sections will undoubtedly give rise to some doubt as to how to use
the indexes. (They work great for this, not at all for that, but this cloud has a silver
lining, and so on). The point is that COT analysis does not take place in a vacuum;
it does not replace cyclical or technical analysis. It augments other techniques. And it

84 COTTHEORY
Economists of all stripes seem to have a fascination with one particular aspect of
speculation:Aretheyearningriskpremia;andifso,isthereturngreaterthanonecould
get in stocks or bonds? One rather famous economist even had practical experience in
this,asanotedspeculator,whichundoubtedlycontributedtoKeynesTheoryofNormal
Backwardation. Just a little background is needed to understand the rationales for the
studiesreviewedinthischapter.
KEYNES’S THEORY OF NORMAL BACKWARDATION
It is essential for any commodity market participant, with longer than a day trader’s
horizon, to understand the concepts of contango and backwardation. Fortunately the
conceptsarenotasdifficulttomasterastheirnames.Allotherfactorsbeingequal(and
theyfrequentlyare),itcostsmoretobuy5,000bushelsofcornfordeliveryoneyearfrom
now,thanforimmediatedelivery.Why?Whoeverownsthecornfortheinterveningyear
must pay loan interest and storage fees and other costs. These are lumped together as
“costtocarry”or“carryingcosts.”IfinJuneforexample,thecashpriceforcornis$2.00
perbushelandthecosttocarryis$0.05permonth,thennormal(or,inthevernacular,
contango) pricing would imply the following forward prices: July $2.05, August $2.10,
September$2.15,andsoon.
Keynes put forward a theory, beginning in the 1920s, that contango was abnormal,
andthatthenormalrelationshipis“backwardation,”whichis,asitsounds,justtheop-
posite of contango. (These nineteenth-century words are sufficiently archaic to assure
their continued use in economic circles, so get used to them.) Keynes’s reasoning (not
surprising, given his speculative moonlighting) was that if a farmer wished to lock in a
priceforcornbeforeitwasevenplantedhecouldnotaskmorethanthecurrentprice,
but must expect less. In Keynes’s view, the ownership of the corn passed to the spec-
ulative buyer at the time of the futures transaction, and because the speculator is also
risk adverse, he would insist on receiving a risk premium commensurate with the risk
of a price decline prior to delivery. This premium was paid in the form of a discount
offthecurrentspot(cash)price,andwouldbeproportionatetothetimeuntildelivery.
Keynes’s“normalbackwardation”wouldvaluecorncurrentlypricedat$2.00inJune,as
worth $1.95 for July delivery, $1.90 for August, $1.85 for September, and so on (again
assuminganarbitrary$0.05permonthcosttocarry).
From a trading standpoint, backwardation provides a rollover profit for longs, be-
causetheypayarelativelylowerpriceeachtimetheyrollthepositiontoafurtherdistant
(cheaper)delivery.Astimepasses,assumingaflatpricetrend,thelong’sinvestmentstill
risestoequalizewiththehigherspotprice.Thiscanbeanimportantpartofcommodity
returns, particularly for a trader with a very long-term horizon. Prices in contango, on
theotherhand,dropduringtheholdingperiod,guaranteeingarolloverloss(whichcan
onlybeoffsetthroughsuccessfulmarketforecasting).

any case, the Commitments of Traders report has become a bountiful source of data
forinquiry.(Earlierstudiesintotraderprofitabilityreliedonsmallsamplesofbrokerage

One other definition might come in handy: “hedging pressure.” This is typically a
Keynesian concept because it implies that hedgers pay a premium for price insurance;
thus, excess hedging demand moves prices. In the original Keynes premise, this would

CANSPECULATORSFORECASTPRICES?
Inoneoftheearlieststudiesattemptingtoappraisetherelativeabilityofdifferenttrader
types in forecasting prices (Can Speculators Forecast Prices? 1957), H. S. Houthakker
assumed that the more accurately price changes were forecasted, the less they would
fluctuate,andtheeasieritwouldbeforaffectedpartiestoadjust.
In 1957, Houthakker conducted a study to understand the role of speculators by
measuringtheirabilitytoforecastpricesinthecommodityfuturesmarkets.Usingend-of-

Inallthreecommodities,Houthakkercalculatesthatlargehedgerswerenetlosers,
while large speculators enjoyed net gains for the period. (Note that I will be using
the term “large speculators,” for these older studies, since this category was, until
the 1980s, composed primarily of individual traders and not commodity funds or
pools.) Houthakker finds that small traders were profitable in cotton, but they were
net losers in both corn and wheat. In addition to being profitable overall, large spec-
ulators were consistently profitable. They made a net profit in cotton for every year
observed. Although in corn and wheat there were a few losing years, none showed a
largeloss.

InReturnstoSpeculatorsandtheTheoryofNormalBackwardation(1985),Changdis-
putes Houthakker’s finding (1957) that Keynes’s theory was inconsistent with the posi-
tive trading results of large speculators. His criticism is twofold: First, Keynes’s theory
doesnotrestonwhetherspeculatorsevermademoney,butratheronwhethertheyshow
consistent profitability. In this pursuit, Houthakker’s study lacks statistical significance
testing.ChangalsodisagreeswithassumptionsHouthakkermakesincalculatingprofits
andlosses.
Chang’sapproachisabitsimplistic,too.Itassumesatypicalspeculatorholdsasin-
gle long contract when the large speculator net position is long, or, alternately, holds
one short contract when large speculators are net short. He uses average monthly or
bimonthly data as available. His results show an “average large speculator” was con-
sistently profitable in wheat, corn, and soybeans futures from July 15, 1951, through
December 31, 1980. This profit explains how speculators are retained so that the mar-
ket can continue to operate. Nevertheless, by using the inverse of the large hedger re-
sultsasaproxyfora“na¨ıve”speculator,Changconcludesthatspeculativeprofitswere
consistent with Keynes’s backwardation, and not attributable to the large speculators’
forecastingskill.

RETURNSTOINDIVIDUALTRADERSOFFUTURES:
AGGREGATERESULTS
In an attempt to disprove Keynes’s theory of normal backwardation, Michael Hartz-
mark(ReturnstoIndividualTradersofFutures:AggregateResults1987)measuresthe
profitability of large traders in nine futures markets—oats, wheat, Minneapolis wheat,
KCBTwheat,porkbellies,livecattle,feedercattle,T-bonds,andT-bills—fromJuly1977
throughDecember1981.
Hartzmarkobtainedconfidentialfilesonthedailypositionsoflargereportingtraders
from the CFTC. The actual trading histories of 4,567 individual traders are constructed
using end-of-day market prices. The study considers only the profitability of positions
held overnight. He finds that large commercial hedgers earned significant profits when
returns were aggregated across all nine markets and that large speculators did not
earn profits significantly different than zero. The $728 million that commercial traders
earned over the period was about 85 percent of the total net profits earned by all
largetraders.

In The Returns and Forecasting Ability of Large Traders in the Frozen Pork Bellies
FuturesMarket(1994),Leuthold,Garcia,andLuexaminetheforecastingabilityoflarge
traders (both commercials and speculators) in the frozen pork bellies futures market.
Daily positions of the 58 largest traders in the frozen pork bellies market from 1982 to
1990 were obtained from the CFTC and used to examine forecasting ability. The study
focuses on trader gains or losses and on the group’s ability to hold its largest position
whenthelargestpricemovementsinthecorrectdirectionoccur.(Thisissimilartothe
“bighitter”inHartzmark1991.)
Leuthold, Garcia, and Lu concluded that large traders generate significant profits
(over $150 million during the study period) and that the distribution of trader returns
over time is not random. A further breakdown between hedgers and speculators finds
that speculators possess a significant forecasting advantage, consistently anticipating
the direction of price changes, and that they were also on the right side of the market
whenlargepricechangesoccurred.ThisissimilartoHartzmark’sfindings,inabroader

HefindsthatCOTindexesforlargespeculatorsandlargehedgersarebothvaluable

to be a price-continuation indicator and large hedger sentiment, a contrarian indicator.
(No surprise here.) Wang employs various trading strategies to test forecasting ability.
Of all the trading strategies tests, simultaneously buying extremely bullish speculator
sentiment (above 80 percent) and selling extremely bearish hedger sentiment (below
20 percent) provides the most reliable forecasts, when compared to other alternatives.
Wang tests these signals over various fixed holding periods, between January 1993 and
March2000,yieldingtheresultslistedinFigure8.2.
His findings indicate that small trader sentiment has no value for forecasting. Fur-
ther, the evidence that large commercial sentiment effectively forecasts price rever-
sals is consistent with the hedging-pressure theory that hedgers are willing to pay risk

pressure effects explain the return predictability in these agricultural futures markets.
Moreover, the hedging-pressure effects tend to last for up to eight weeks following the

cluding other sentiment and fundamental indicators. These are both irrelevant to our

Despitelookingforbuyingorsellingsurges,insteadofclimaxes,Wang’sconclusions
aresimilartohisearlierstudy:
Wealsofindthatspeculatorsgenerallyoutperformhedgers.Atradingstrategyfol-
lowing large changes in speculator positions and/or contrary to large changes
in hedger positions is significantly profitable in most agricultural, commodity,
andcurrencyfuturesmarkets.However,thesuperiorperformanceseemstoresult
from hedging pressure effects rather than superior timing ability possessed by
speculators. The prevalence of hedging pressure effects in U.S. futures markets is
consistent.
Acoupleofinterestingobservationsaremade.One,Wangfindsthatbothlargetrader
groupsaremorepredictiveofsellingthanbuyingopportunities.Andsecondly,thatcom-
bining the signals of the two larger trader groups (looking for joint signals) provides
more reliable forecasts than either group does on its own. Average annualized holding
period returns were positive for the agricultural portfolio for holding periods of up to
eightweeksfollowingsignalgeneration(Table8.3).
Figure 8.1 illustrates that this methodology creates buy and sell signals very simi-
larto our Movement Index ±40 point surge signals. (Movement Indexes are gray back-
ground,andtheblackhistogrambarsindicatesignals.)Thetwomethodsgenerateahigh

differencemaybeattributableinparttohisshorterlook-backperiod—fourweeks,ver-
sussixweeksfortheMovementIndex.
I have to take exception with one conclusion that is contrary to every other study
listed,includingWang2001.InWang’sintroductiontothe2003study,hestatesinpart:
“Speculators are contrarians, but respond positively to market sentiment. In contrast,
hedgers engage in positive feedback [momentum] trading and trade against market
sentiment.”
Ifyouthinkthestatementitselfseemscontradictory,weareonthesametrack.Mo-
mentum trading is the dominant strategy of large speculators, which is self-evident on
any futures net position chart. Figure 8.2 illustrates negative feedback (counter-trend)
tradingthatistypicalofcommercialnetpositionpatterns.
Thismayseemasmalldiscrepancy,butitleadsWangdownthewrongtrack.Buying
when commercials begin to buy and selling when they begin to sell generates negative
results. Wang’s trading rule testing (Table 8.2) confirms this inverse relationship. For
positive trading results, you must generally do just the opposite of commercials: Buy
when they begin to sell, and sell when they begin to buy. While Wang admits this, his
earliererrorleadstoalogicalbutunsubstantiatedassertion:
Thepositivefeedbacktradingbyhedgers[false]togetherwiththeirnegativeperfor-
mance [true] suggests that hedgers have a destabilizing impact on futures prices

frequencyhere.Infact,henotedasmuchinhisconclusion:
Analyses of intramonth [sic] trading behavior, however, reveal that speculators
buy (sell) when the returns in the same month are higher (lower), whereas the
opposite is true for hedgers. This suggests that speculators tend to herd and their

SUMMARY
We have looked at 11 studies spanning 50 years. While this list is not exhaustive, it is,
I think, comprehensive in its representation of the literature (and probably exhaust-
ing to some casual readers of this book). The weight of the academic evidence seems
fairlyconclusivethatlargespeculatorsarepositive-feedback(momentum)traders,while
commercials are negative-feedback. This supports the general conclusion that hedgers
tendtolosemoney,whilelargespeculatorsshownetprofitsfromfuturestrading.Most
of these profits are attributed to simple insurance premiums transferred from com-
mercial hedgers to speculators. It is assumed that for commercials, hedging is a cost

THE STUDY DATA
The study in this chapter covers a period of approximately seven years, beginning in
2000. Until October 2000, the CFTC released two weekly reports on alternating weeks
(unless a holiday interfered with either the previous week’s compilation or the current
week’s release). Since the Options and Futures report was posted on Monday, it was
unavailableuntileitheroneortwoweeksafterthecompilationdate.FromOctober2000
toJanuary2002,weeklyreportswerereleasedeachMonday(againwithexceptionsdue
to holidays as well as occasional CFTC technical problems). From January 2002, the
reports were nominally released on Friday afternoon at 3:30 prevailing Eastern Time,
concurrentwiththeFuturesOnlyreport.
Fortunatelyforthisstudy,Ihavetheadvantageofnotneedingtoestimatethedata
lagbecauseIpersonallycollectedeveryCommitmentsreportissuedinthepast20years,
and made note of the actual release date in the data base. For this study, I convert the
weeklyCOTdatatodailyfrequency,aligningtheCommitmentsdatatotheclosingprice
onthedayoftheactualCOTrelease.Allentriesandexitsarebasedontheopenpriceon
thefirsttradingdayfollowingtheCOTdatarelease.Noallowanceismadeforslippage
and commission, but the number of trades is shown, so that you may draw your own
conclusions.
Futures contracts have limited life spans, and usually spend no more than one to
threemonthsasthemostactiveor“front-month”contract.Forourpurposes, Iassume
trading in the most active contract. Daily price files are constructed using the back-
adjusted method, whereby each contract is succeeded when its activity (volume and
openinterest)recedesbelowthatofamoredistantdelivery.Atthetimeofrollover,an
adjustmentismadeforthedifferenceinpricebetweenthenewandolddeliveries.The
entire back history of prices is adjusted to this difference so that the day-to-day price
movement always reflects the range of the most active contract, with no gaps between
contracts.
This is the preferred method of constructing continuous data series for most types
of system tests. It eliminates the effects of roll profit or loss, which should be consid-
eredseparatelybasedontheholdingperiod.Forthisstudy,myinterestwaspurelyprice
movement relative to COT signal generation, and no cost or benefit of roll was consid-
ered. Historical price levels will be shown relative to the current front-month contract,

When we become quite familiar with stock charts we shall find our-
selves looking for various pictures and patterns ... it is important
that we do not entirely lose sight of the fundamental basis for the

more sellers than intended, the trend will turn down in search of a level that will elicit
new buying demand. These transitions are not usually smooth, but happen in fits and

What may not be readily visible at this scale is that point C was a slightly lower low
than point B. This is not unusual for a double-bottom, and the lack of follow-through
on breakdown was an encouraging sign. From here, the double-bottom was textbook
perfect.Theinitialrallyattemptmetresistanceatthepriorpeak,buttheensuingpullback
reached only midway before commercial buying provided the final launch into a new
bull trend. Note that at the send-off low, the COT Index hit 87 percent, not quite an
extreme. This is about as clean a bottom as you will find, but it is by no means a rare
example.
Like beauty, a pattern often is in the eye of the beholder. The example in Figure

suchas“failureswing,”“W,”“Adam&Eve,”awholeteapartyofsomethingcalled“cup

lustrated the value of combining changes in trader sentiment (Movement Index) with

of synch with the data it is derived from, the histogram’s peaks and troughs are re-

he primary currency markets—those that track corresponding FOREX (spot
FOReign EXchange) markets—are traded on the International Monetary Market
(IMM)attheChicagoMercantileExchange(CME).Currencyfuturescontractsare
denominated in dollars. In FOREX, the base currency and the quote currency vary by
convention.Table12.1liststheprimaryfuturescontractsthathavesubstantialCOTdata
available, and the corresponding FOREX market. For each, I have included the closing
price for July 11, 2007, for the front-month (September) futures contract, along with
the spot price quoted for the respective FOREX market. Small price differences reflect
the cost-to-carry for September futures. Large discrepancies indicate FOREX markets
wheretheU.S.dollarisnotthebasecurrency.Thesearetheinverseofthefuturesprice
(less cost-to-carry, principally interest rate differentials). The USD/JPY is an example.
For FOREX, the quote currency is listed second. Figure numbers for the respective

are these position changes important enough to cause exchange rate movements?
Specifically, do transactions in the futures market that anticipate a foreign cur-
rency’sdepreciationhelpcausethatcurrencytoweaken?
Atfirstglance,thepossibilitythatfuturesmarkettransactionscanmovecur-
rency values might seem unlikely given the low turnover in net position changes
relativetothehighturnoverofallforeignexchangetransactions.TheBankforIn-
ternationalSettlementsestimatesthatinApril2001,currencytransactionsworld-
wide averaged $354 billion per day for the euro-dollar pair and $231 billion for
the yen-dollar pair [Table12.2]. By comparison, the standard deviation of weekly
changes in speculators’ net positions is roughly $1 billion for both the euro and
theyen.
However,animportantqualificationmustbemade.Thedifferenceinmagni-
tude between speculators in the futures market and all foreign exchange transac-
tions is perhaps less overwhelming when one considers that a large share of the
dailyturnoverisattributabletoaseriesofriskmanagementtransactionsbetween

($9 million/(1 − 0.9)). The smaller the percentage held by each dealer following
each transaction, the higher the transaction turnover. In this case, each dealer

Lyons’ example illustrates that the high volume of foreign exchange transac-
tionsisnotasoverwhelmingafactorasitmightinitiallyappearwhencompared
with the volume of futures market transactions. This outcome suggests that the
global volume by itself does not preclude the possibility that speculators in the
futuresmarkethelpcausecurrencymovements(KlitgaardandWeir2004).
COMMERCIALS
Banksarethemostlikelyholdersoflargecurrencypositions,butthebankswiththetop
five portfolios of currency derivatives each hold a multiple of the total notional value
of all reported currency contracts on the IMM. These are also among the leading swap
dealers: JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America, State Street Bank, and HSBC.
Besides the banks (which may also be acting on behalf of, or to cover commitments
to, customers), large multinational companies may make the list of large hedgers in
currencyfutures.
U.S. DOLLAR INDEX
Thereisoneoddityamongthefuturesmarkets,whichisthe“U.S.DollarIndex,”traded
on the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT). Currencies are always exchanged in pairs,
but this index is based on a trade-weighted combination of foreign currencies. And it
isthishybridcompositionthatmakesitparticularlyusefulasageneraltrendindicator.
This is not just applicable to dollar cross rates. The U.S. futures markets (and in many
casestheunderlyingcashmarket)haveaglobalcustomerbaseandattractmanybillions
of dollars in foreign purchases. (As of April 2007, foreigners held $2 trillion ($2,000
billion) in U.S. Treasury debt instruments (Treasury Department), and this does not
include futures and other derivative holdings totaling another $1.2 trillion. Physical

currencies. The result of this simulation (or pseudo–Dollar Index) is shown in Figure
12.1b. In comparing the two indicators, an immediate observation is that the simulated
open interest is 2800 percent of the NYBOT contract. The pseudo–open interest shows
the usual sawtooth pattern resulting from the massive liquidation, which is typical of
quarterlycontractexpirations(rollovertothenextquarterlydelivery).Althoughyoucan
detectthisfall-offintheactualdollarcontract,theopeninterestdoesnotalwaysrecover.
This is a particular problem during flat trending periods like the one circled in Figure
12.1a.Thisepisode,however,demonstratestheversatilityoftheCOTIndex,whichpro-
ducedatimely–40pointplungesellsignalatthetopofthetradingrangeinOctober2006,
despitethelowopeninterest.Thesignalsfromthesimulatedserieswere,perhaps,more
decisive because they registered full selling climaxes of less than 5 percent COT. Over
theyears,thepseudo-COTIndexhasbeenaconsistentsourceofusefulsignals.
When you start making things up, there is no end to the concoctions possible. But
there is one additional category of pseudoindicator that is worthy of discussion. I call
these the COT Cross Indexes. They are constructed just as the name implies and for
just the purpose implied. The futures markets for cross-rates—currency pairs that do
not include the dollar—are not well enough established to provide a usable COT data
base. So I simply combine the COT data for two futures contracts to create the COT
Cross Indexes. To get the correct combination, multiply the quote currency times −1
before adding. (For the EUR/JPY, the yen is the quote currency.) How true to life is
thispseudoindex?ThereisasmallamountofactualCOTdataavailablefortheNYBOT

not provide a long comparison, but there is a strong similarity between the two data

The potential utility of the COT Indexes extends well beyond the currency futures
and spot markets. These move in tandem and, as you might expect, have high positive

Table 12.4 is a list of markets that showed a high positive correlation with one of

played a high negative correlation with the indicated currency price series. The data
should be equally applicable in the inverse (just think of Ginger Rogers). The “R” col-

tock indexes futures used to be a simple matter: pull up the S&P 500 chart. This
and the Kansas City contracts are all there was for many years. In addition to
the NASDAQ, Dow, Russell, and other stock indexes, in recent years the E-mini
contracts have grown to present a conundrum. The CFTC adjusts large trader report-
inglevelswiththeaimofhaving70to90percentofopeninterestreported.Forthebig

Thus,thehistoricalchartsprovidedinthischapterareforthecombinedE-miniand

The sawtooth pattern in nonspreading open interest is even more pronounced in

ThenetpositionpatternsinthemetalmarketsdotestthemettleoftheCOTIndex.Onthe
goldchartinFigure14.1,thenetpositionlinesseemedtobelackinganydefinedfeatures
or obvious signals. The commercial and fund net positions were going along with no
real regard for price action. The COT Index really shines at enhancing the signals that
escapeevenatrainedeye.Duringtheperiodgraphed,2004to2007,goldpriceswerein
a sustained up-trending mode, at least until the May 2006 top. Leading up to 2004 the
COT Index displayed the prototypical bull market pattern, remaining bound to bearish
readings. But the Index rose to the occasion at several market setbacks, triggering a
stringoftimelybuysignals.Thisstringextendsbackintimetothemajormarketbottom

chartinFigure14.2.)Eventhoughmostofthebuysignalsweregeneratedwithabove-90
percentCOTbuyingextremes,allofthemincorporateda+40buyingsurgesignal(noted
byablackbar).
As this book is written, prices have been in a sideways pattern for a little over
one year. We are waiting for a resolution to a recent major COT buy signal, visible on
Figure14.2.
Recent breakout attempts have been turned back by relatively minor commercial
selling pressure. This suggests a lack of bullish enthusiasm on the part of speculative
funds.However,therisinglevelofnonspreadingopeninterest(Figure14.2)couldindi-

performedonotherkindsofspreads.InFigure14.2simulatednetpositionsareshownfor

THE COPPER CAPER
There is no trading methodology I know of that does not at one time or another go
bonkers (I believe this is the technical term). The probability of this is most likely
higher under unusual market conditions. (You would like to think so, at least.) This is
whatmakesblackboxcomputer-generatedsignalssodangerous.Toprotectyourselfand

That was the last valid signal generated by the COT Index. Oh, it generated buy sig-

COMMERCIALS
The three principal U.S. copper producers—Phelps Dodge, Asarco, and Kennecott—
hedgefutureproductionusingvariousderivatives.Majorcopperusers,suchasWolver-
ine Tube, hedge their inventories. Gold is a study in the potential downside of hedg-
ing.Oneproducer,AshantiGoldfieldsCo.wassuedbyshareholderswhenitwasunable
to meet margin calls on hedges. The gold producers have themselves been blamed for
suppressing gold prices through their own hedging (forward selling). Futures and op-
tions are hardly the only venue for gold hedging. Central banks lease gold to produc-
ers who sell it on the open market and invest the proceeds in bonds in order to secure
currentpricing.

drive home how critical your thought process can be to deriving value from the COT

COMMERCIAL HEDGERS
The largest commercial producers of oil, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron Texaco, and
Conoco Philips, hedge oil using various methods including futures and options. Exxon
Mobil, Royal Dutch / Shell, and British Petroleum are the largest in natural gas pro-
duction. On the user side, utilities, airlines, and steel producers are among the hedging
prospects.

SOY AND GRAIN CORRELATION TABLES
In terms of markets positively correlated with the grain and soy complex, wheat and
soybean oil each have more than 250 issues that are 75 percent correlated. Although
soybeansare80percentcorrelatedtowheat,soybeanshaveveryfewothercorrelations,
whichseemsstrangewhensoybeanoilisnearthetopofthesoybeanlist,too.Soybean
meal, corn, and oats also show almost no high correlations. Corn is at the top of the
wheat list, and yet has almost no other strong correlations. Strange—and a reminder
to do your own homework. There are very few duplicates between wheat and soybean
oil. Issues with correlations of 80 percent or better are listed in Table 17.1. This list is

Moonlighting
Anybody who plays the market without inside information is like a
manbuyingcowsinthemoonlight.
—AttributedtolegendarytraderDanielDrew(1797–1879)
T
here are three viable livestock futures markets: feeder cattle, live cattle, and lean
hogs. The open interest in pork bellies is so marginal that it is reported only
sporadically in the COT report (due to the minimum 20 large traders require-
ment). Small traders are a bigger factor in these markets, especially with feeder cat-
tle, than in most other futures markets. This, plus the short trading cycles and the
unusual seasonals affecting various individual delivery periods, make for some inter-
esting moves. Quite often the COT data provides advance warning of imminent trend
changes.
IT MIGHT BE CORNY, BUT...
The hog-corn ratio is used to predict future hog production, normally with a 12- to
24-month lag. The theory originated with the family farm, where a relatively low corn
price relative to hogs would cause the farmer to feed the corn to pigs. A high corn
pricewould,ontheotherhand,limitpigproduction.Canthenetpositionsofthesetwo
markets aid the forecasting of this ratio? To find out, I first converted each market’s
netpositionstoseparateratiosusingtheproceduredetailedinAppendixA,Example3.
This conversion seemed appropriate because the two markets are not related (except
by way of the food chain), and this procedure eliminates any open interest imbalance.

SMALL CAN BE BEAUTIFUL
In Chapter 5, “Net Positions,” livestock was mentioned as a sector where small trader
netpositionsmightproveaneffectivepricepredictor.Thelivecattlechart(Figure18.2)
shows the small trader net position opposite live cattle prices. Opposite is the opera-
tive word. The prototypical commercial mirror image pattern is readily apparent. The
dominance of this pattern suggests that commercial hedgers are a heavy influence in
the small trader totals. Peaks in the small trader net position mark price lows, and net
positiontroughssignalpricepeaks.

Tyson Foods, Cargill (Excel), Smithfield, and others involved in both the production

ariously called “international” or “food and fiber” or “softs,” the six commodity
marketsoforangejuice,cocoa,coffee,sugar,lumber,andcottonoftengetlumped
together. There also is a commodity index to add to the mix; that makes seven.
Many of these commodity markets are dominated by trade interests (commercials). If
there were ever a set of markets where some technical indicator of the supply and de-
mandbalancewasbadlyneeded,thesewouldbethem.Fortunatelyfortheclued-up,the
COTreportfrequentlyfindsopportunitiesinthesemarketsbeforetheybecomenewspa-

Orange juice is an exception that highlights one of the principles of net position
analysis discussed in Chapter 5. The COT Index does not always signal the exact start

May25.So,therehasbeennowarningfromlargecommercialhedgersthatthebear
marketmayhaveended.Nonetheless,the“Commitments”patternsuggeststhatan
important bottom is being made. The net position pattern is very similar to the
October 2000 bottom (also to 1997—not shown). In 2000, the COT Index read 31
at the price low. From there, commercials sold aggressively into the initial rally.

A
lthough this new subset of the Options and Futures Combined COT report is
just six months old as this book is written, and it carries only 12 markets, there
are a few useful scraps of information to be gleaned. Table 20.1 lists the con-
tracts included in the COT-Supplemental and the breakdown of the total contract val-
ues of CIT positions inJanuary 2007, when reporting began. The total notional value is
nearly $34 billion, making the commodity index traders the largest player on the long
sideofthesephysicalcommodities.Theyholdlargerpositionsthanthelargespeculative

THE COT-SUPPLEMENTALREPORT
TheCFTCtookpubliccommentsbeforeinitiatingtheSupplementalreport.(SeeBriese
andWilliams2006.)TheInternationalSwapsandDerivativesAssociation(ISDA)submit-
tedcommentsontheirmembers’behalf,whichprovedquiterevealing:
[T]henon-traditionalcommercial[CIT]categoryishighlyconcentrated,with,we
believe, the top four swap dealers composing over 70% of the category. In some of
the lower-volume commodities markets, only a single swap dealer is a dominant
participant...(Zerzan2006).
This concentration is disquieting, but the Commission hushed it up by omitting
the Long Form report for the COT-Supplemental (which details the number of large
traders in each category). The report is being released under a two-year pilot program,

so there is no guarantee of expanded (or even continuing) coverage. It is pretty clear
where this idea originated. (By the way, the CFTC’s call for public comments drew a
record response. The results were 4,658 in favor of expanded reporting of CIT posi-
tions and 1 against.) The one dissenting voice appeared to carry considerable weight,
as the Commission’s determination seemed to be lifted directly from the lobbyist’s
recommendation:
ISDA believes that public policy is best served by continuing the COT reports in
their current form, as they are beneficial to all market participants and play a
role in promoting the efficient operation of market forces. ISDA strongly recom-
mendsagainstthecreationofanew,non-traditionalcommercialcategory[CIT].
If the Commission decides otherwise, we recommend that any additional report-
ing be in a no more than two-year pilot program that we would be prepared
to work with the Commission to design with a limited number of commodities
(Zerzan2006).

It did not take much commercial selling—as we have been warning—to start the
price slide. It will take an enormous commercial effort now just to slow the rate
of descent. But it is likely too late to avoid an extended and perhaps severe de-
cline. The NASDAQ was the strongest index on the upside, and the only one to
draw enough commercial selling to trigger a COT sell signal. From this we sur-
mise that there is overwhelming commercial selling pressure just above the re-
cent highs in the other indexes. In other words, if the S&P, Russell, and Dow

Dodging the Pitfalls
in COT Data
Please be advised that prior to September 30, 1992 only mid-month
and month-end data are available. Since the mid-month data were
notpublishedonacurrentbasis,theymaycontainidentifiabledata
errors. A substantial period of time elapsed between the report date
for these data and their eventual compilation. As a result it is not
possibletocorrecttheerrors.

Note that all comments refer to the modern data, post-1982. Data anomalies prior
to March 29, 1995, predate (and, therefore, do not affect) the Futures and Options
Combined report. The COT-Supplemental report is a subset of the Futures and Op-
tionsCombinedreport,withadatastartingpointofJanuary3,2006.Themainanomaly
affecting the COT-Supplementary report is that the first year’s data was not available
contemporaneously. Rather, it was released on January 8, 2007, together with the first
currentreport.TraderstatisticslistedintheCOT-SupplementalreportpriortoJanuary

DATA PERIODICITY AND LAG
Beginning in December 1981, the COT report was compiled as of the close of the last
tradingdayofeachmonth,andpublishedonthe11thofthefollowingmonth—orifthe
11thwasaweekendorholiday,onthenextbusinessday.Separatereportswerereleased
inNewYorkandChicagoandwerewidelydispersed—byhandouttoexchangemembers
and the media, and by mail subscription. My practice, when I began publishing Bullish
Review of Commodity Futures Markets in 1988, was to have the reports picked up by
couriersinNewYorkandChicagoandovernightedtome.
In1990,theCFTCreceivedseveralhundredrequests(therewasnosecretthatthey
were all from Bullish Review subscribers) requesting more frequent and more timely
Commitmentsreporting.IworkedwiththeCFTCtoestablishtheelectronicreleasefor-
mat, and twice-monthly reporting began in November 1990. The mid-month report was
tabulatedonthecloseofthe15th(orpriorbusinessdayifthe15thfellonaweekendor
holiday).BothreportswerereleasedelectronicallythroughMartinMariettaInformation
Systems (mainframe computer timesharing before Al Gore thought up the Internet) on
the sixth business day following compilation. These improvements effectively quieted
naysayerswhothoughtthatthedatawasalreadydatedbythetimetradersreadit.The
COTreportwasavailabletomeat3:15P.M.Centraltimethedayofrelease,providingam-
ple time to get my analysis to subscribers—using fax, mailgram, cablegram, Telex, and
modem dial up—before the next day’s market open, and just seven business days after
tabulation.
TheCFTCalsoreleasedahistoricalseriesofbimonthlyCommitmentsdataoncom-
puter tape covering the period of 1986 to 1990. This was the first time that historical
datawasmadeavailabletothepublic.Priortothis,theonlypubliclyavailabledatabase

readerswillhavenotedintheparagraphabove,thatactualbimonthlyreportingdidnot
begin until 1990. The historical data release was not the same data that the CFTC had
originally reported for the period. If your data base contains mid-month figures for the
period 1986 to 1990, it originated from this historical data release tape, and not the ac-
tualpublishedCOTreports.Thus,themid-monthdatafrom1986to1990wasnotactually
availableforsignalgenerationatthetimeofcompilation.Also,themid-monthfiguresare
unaudited,causingtheCFTCtoissuethecautionarynotethatisquotedatthetopofthis
appendix.Thefutures-onlydatabasecurrentlydistributedattheCFTCwebsitecontains
thesameerror–riddendata.
The bimonthly schedule that actually existed from November 1990 was changed to
every other week beginning on October 13, 1992. This is when the current practice of
tabulatingtraderpositionsoneachTuesday’sclosebegan.Itisimportanttonote,how-
ever, that in the beginning, the figures were not released weekly. Two weekly reports
were released every other Friday. For example, on October 16, 1992, two reports were
released:oneasofOctober13,andtheotherforpositionsasofOctober6.Thiscreated
anominallagof3daysforpublicationweeks,buta10-daylagfornonpublication(skip)
weeks.(Youcanworkaheadfromtheinitialreportdatesgivenheretoestablishwhich

schedule,wheretraderpositionsarereportedeachFridayforthepriorTuesday’sclose,
beganonOctober9,2000.
Options positions were first accounted for in the Options and Futures Combined
report, beginning March 21, 1995. Although the “as of” dates for this report were the
same as the Futures report (normally Tuesday), the public release was delayed to the
nextbusinessdayfollowingthefuturesreportposting.ThismeantthattheOptionsand
Futures Combined report was usually posted to the CFTC’s website on Monday after-
noon.AswiththeFuturesOnlyreport,twoweeklyCombinedreportswerereleasedon
alternateweeks,untilweeklypublicationbeganinOctober2000.Theoptionsreportdid
not reach publishing parity with the Futures report until January 18, 2002. So the next
time you see system testing that took a position on the next weekly open after a COT
signalwasgenerated,youwillknowthatthetestingpriorto2002isinvalid.(Thosekinds
ofresultsarenotjusthypothetical,theyareimaginary.)
This concludes the scheduled lag times. There were numerous disruptions to the
normalscheduleforholidays.Thenthereweretheunanticipatedeventsthatintroduced

CONTRACT SPECIFICATION CHANGES
In most cases, the CFTC acknowledges a change in contract specifications by issuing
a new contract market code, effectively terminating the old data series. This practice
ensuresthattherecordedCommitmentsfigureswillmatchtheiroriginal(orcorrected)

to $250 times, effective with the November 4, 1997, COT report. This contract has by
far the longest history among the stock index futures, and it would be a shame to
lose the first 10 years of data. The remedy is apparent in the two reports that span
the contract change. Total open interest as of October 28, 1997, is 253,531, approxi-
mately half that shown in the next report, 497,048 on November 4. The fix is to mul-
tiply all positions prior to November 1997 by 2. This creates an apple-to-apples data
base and—as long as you consistently use the $250 multiplier—should not materially
affect any calculations you might wish to make on the data series. By the way, the
CFTC is not consistent in handling these changes (other than to leave the historical
record as is). In this case, they did not bother to change the market code identifier
to indicate a specification change. The only hint in the data is the sudden doubling
ofthetotals.
NYBOT Dollar Index
A similar contract size adjustment must be made to the New York Board of Trade Dol-
larIndex,whichintroduceda$1,000timestheindexcontractonMay29,1992.Theold

Live to Lean Hogs
The third type of adjustment becomes necessary when the principal hedging contract
changes. The primary hog contract traded on the CME changed from live hogs to lean
hogs in 1996. Because both contracts were 40,000 pounds (and since the pig’s ass pre-
sumably was still pork), my solution was to simply add the new lean hog data to the
historical live hog series. In this case, the new contract was phased in, and both con-
tractswerereportedformuchof1996.Onceagain,Icombinedthetwototalswhereboth

COMEX Copper
The New York Commodity Exchange copper contract was upgraded to #1 grade in
1989. Since both contracts were sized at 25,000 pounds, I added the new contract to

When Not to Adjust Historical Data
When confronted with new markets in a report, my practice is to wait and see if the
situation resolves itself. For instance, the COT report carried both the New York Cot-
tonExchange(NYCE)5-YearT-NotecontractandasimilarCBOTproductbetween1987
and 1990. Depending on your view, you might consider combining trader positions for
contractsfromdifferentexchangesthatsharesubstantiallysimilarspecifications.Inthis
case, open interest in the New York contract never reached more than a fraction of its
Chicago counterpart and eventually petered out. In this situation, the NYCE contract
was easy to ignore—on two counts. First, it did not endure long enough to accumu-
late a sufficient history for comparison. Secondly, open interest totals were negligible
compared with the CBOT contract. The problem resolved itself without ever needing
to fuss with the New York numbers. Similarly, several New York Sugar and Cocoa Ex-
change variations on milk futures were easily ignored until they disappeared from the
Commitmentsreport.
The eruption of mini contracts in recent years created a new conundrum, particu-
larlywhenopeninterestlevelsrosetolevelstoolargetoignore.Thepuzzlewasnotthe
differingcontractsizes—thiscouldeasilybeadjustedout—butthedisparityinthelarge

ness activities hedged by the use of the futures or option markets.” In order to ensure that
traders are classified with accuracy and consistency, the Commission staff may exercise judg-
