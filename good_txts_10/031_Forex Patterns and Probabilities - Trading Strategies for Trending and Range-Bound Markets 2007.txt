I’ve read dozens of books on trading, most of which are not worth your
time. Most of the books that I’ve read contained a kernel of useful in-
formation, buried beneath an avalanche of filler. I decided that if I were
ever asked to write a book about trading, it would be the antithesis of
those books. Instead of performing a sort of “Dance of the Seven Veils,”
I’dpresentanabundanceofusefulinformationinawaythatmostpeople

FROM STOCKS TO FOREX
LikemosttradersintheUnitedStates,myfirstexperiencesinvolvedstock
trading. My first trade, 100 shares in a NASDAQ biotech stock, yielded a
smallloss.
Iwasluckytohavestartedoutduringthemid-1990s,duringoneofthe
mostoutstandingbullmarketsinhistory.Inthatenvironment,aslongasa
traderwentwiththetrend,itwasnottoodifficulttomakemoney.Itwasa
veryforgivingmarketthatwouldbailoutevenpoortraders.Thetrickwas
tounderstandthedifferencebetweenbeinggoodandmerelybeinglucky.
Many traders who I believed were talented began to falter when trading
conditions became less than ideal. I realized that, like them, I had been
a lucky trader, and that luck was transitory. I didn’t want to be lucky; I
wantedtobecomeagoodtrader,onewhocouldmakemoneyinanymarket
environment.IwantedtoworkonWallStreet.
GETTING TO WALL STREET
Aftersendingoutdozensofresumes,IwasinterviewedandhiredbyaWall
Street firm as a trader. The fact that I didn’t live in New York at the time
wasaminordetail,andsoonIwasgettingupataround4:00A.M.tobegin

I would exit my train beneath the World Trade Center, meet up with

I also learned the disadvantages of trading in this environment, as there
were too many people in the room expressing too many ideas and opin-
ions.Essentially,itwasahugeroomfullofambitiousandhighlycompet-
itive alpha males. Some of the traders had egos that were out of control,
and couldn’t help but loudly express every mundane thought that rattled
around their skulls. Others would merely express anger and frustration;
the distinctive sound of a computer keyboard being smashed, along with
the odd tinkling sound of letter keys flying through the air, is etched into
mymemory.

concepts (at least it was new to me) to which I was exposed at this time

It was shocking to learn that foreign exchange trading, or forex, was
tremendously popular in the rest of the world, and had been for many
years.Formostoftheworld,theforexmarket,notthestockmarket,isthe

sidered to be normal, just “part of the game.” Stock traders don’t think
twice about these situations, because they are an ingrained part of their
dailylives.
Partial Fills
For example, the “partial fill” is a normal occurrence in stock trading. A
partial fill occurs when a trader places an order for a certain number of
shares,let’ssayfor2,000sharesofstock,andinsteadreceivesonlyapor-
tion of the order, for example, 300 shares. This happens all the time; the
mostlogicalexplanationisthatperhapstherewereonly300sharesavail-

The forex market, however, is highly liquid or “thick.” Partial fills are
extremelyrareforallbutthebiggesttraders.
Slippage
“Slippage”isanotherproblemthatstockandfuturestradersmustdealwith
everyday.Slippageisdefinedas“thedifferencebetweenestimatedtrans-
actioncostsandtheamountactuallypaid.”
For example, suppose you purchased 1,000 shares of stock XYZ at a
price of $50 per share. In order to protect yourself in the event that the
price moves against you, you place a protective “stop” order (an order to
sell) at $49. So your worst-case scenario is that you’ll lose $1 per share,
whichinthiscaseequals$1,000,right?
Wrong. If the price falls below $49 without touching the exact price
of $49 (remember, stock markets are “thin” compared to forex), one of
twothingswillhappen.Eitheryourorderwillnotbeexecutedatall,orit
willbeexecutedatapriceinthevicinityof$49.Amazingly,theexecuted
price is almost always less favorable than the price you desired! Slippage
cuts into a trader’s profits and is a major headache for stock and futures
traders.
Slippage is rare in the currency market. Many forex market makers
have a “no slippage” policy, giving currency traders a greater degree of
pricecertainty.
The Specialist
Another hurdle to successful professional stock trading is the specialist.

activityofalistedstock.EarlyinmyWallStreetcareer,Ihadanunforget-
table trading experience that featured the specialist of a once high-flying

In the forex market, the spread is often “fixed,” allowing the trader a
greaterdegreeofcertainty.
The “Uptick Rule”
Yet another frustrating roadblock to the success of equity traders is the
“uptick rule.” Stock traders can “go long” (place a trade that will become
profitableifthestockrises)whenevertheywish,butinorderto“sellshort”
(placeatradethatwillbecomeprofitableifthestockfalls),equitytraders
mustgothroughaseriesofmachinationsthatcanprovebothmaddening

WELCOME TO FOREX
While these impediments make stock trading more difficult than many of
uswouldlike,somegoodtraderscananddoovercomethesehurdles.Yet
I often hear stock traders complaining about how the specialist ruined
theirtrade(inlanguagethatwouldscorchyourears),orhowthey’vebeen
“slipped” out of their profits, or that they placed a perfect entry, only to
be foiled by a partial fill, or that they missed an opportunity to sell short

A NEW BEGINNING
And so the journey began. As much as I used to enjoy trading stocks, I
don’t miss the headaches. It took a while to get used to the “feel” of the
forex market, as it trades very differently from the way stocks trade. At
first,ItriedtotradeforexthesameexactwaythatItradedstocks,andfor
a few months I lost money. Once I adjusted to the different speed of the
forex market, things eventually fell into place. You see, individual stocks
move like jackrabbits—one moment they are standing still and the next
momenttheyarezigzaggingandflyingaround.

Forexample,whenatravelerfromtheUnitedStatescrossesthebor-

dollars. This traveler is essentially selling the U.S. dollar and buying the
Canadiandollar.
THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND THE U.S. DOLLAR
In 2002, our traveler would have received about C$1.60 in Canadian cur-
rency for every U.S. dollar. We could say that the exchange rate at that
time for the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar was about 1.60 Canadian dollars
per U.S. dollar. If we wanted to be precise, we could add several decimal
spaces,andexpresstheexchangerateas1.6000.

the value of the euro rose from about US$0.85 cents to above US$1.35
(see Figure 2.2). Due to this shift in exchange rates, U.S. citizens found
that vacationing in Europe became much more expensive, while persons
visitingtheUnitedStatesfromEuropefoundthattheirbuyingpowerhad

This resulted in a huge influx of shoppers from Europe visiting the

TRADING TERMINOLOGY
Traders have their own language. They use words that might confuse a
“newbie”oranontrader.Tradinglingoisalmostatypeofsecrethandshake
thatletsothertradersknowthatyou’reamemberoftheclub.
There is a method to the madness of trading terminology. Many of
thesetermsallowatradertoexpressaconcisethoughtinoneortwoquick

long,short,andflat.Infact,everytraderisalwayslong,short,orflat.What

However,ifyouaskthatsamequestionofmeandIanswer,“I’mgoing

Spot or Cash Market
Thespotpriceisthevalueofanobjectoritemrightnow,or“onthespot.”
This differsfrom a futurescontract, which places a value on an object or
iteminthefuture.
For example, suppose you want to buy a bottle of water. You are
thirsty, so you want the water right now. The person behind the counter
charges you $1 for a bottle of water. Therefore, $1 is the “spot” price of
wateratthatstore—thepriceyouwillpayrightnow,or“onthespot.”
Ontheotherhand,supposeyouwanttolockinapriceforwaterthat
you’ll need in the future. You negotiate with the storeowner, taking infla-
tion, supply and demand, and future uncertainty into consideration. You
agreeonapriceof$1.05.Youhavenowenteredintoafuturescontractfor
water.
When you see a reference to the “spot” or “cash” forex market, this
is done to differentiate between the current (spot) market and the future
(futures)market.
Liquid
A liquid or “thick” market is a market in which selling and buying can be
accomplished with ease. This is because there are more buyers and sell-
ers in a liquid market like forex. A market with few buyers and sellers is
referredtoas“illiquid.”

Resistance
Resistance is a point on the chart where the exchange rate has shown a
tendency to stop rising. Like support, resistance is an area, not an exact
pricelevel.Thinkofresistanceastheceilingaboveyou(seeFigure2.6).
Breakout
A breakout occurs when the exchange rate breaks beneath support or
aboveresistance(seeFigure2.7).
Trend
A trend occurs when the exchange rate moves consistently in one direc-
tion,eitherhigherorlower(seeFigure2.8).
Range
Arangeoccurswhentheexchangeratehasnocleardirectionandiscon-

A consolidation occurs when the exchange rate is trapped in an ever-

Volatility
Volatilityisameasureoftheamountbywhichacurrencypairisexpected

itinordertotradesuccessfully.Alongtheway,somequestionswill
inevitablyoccur.Inthischapter,Ianswersomeofthemostcommon
questionsaboutforex.
WHY DOES THE BIG MONEY TRADE FOREX?
The forex market (which goes by many names, including FX, foreign ex-
change, the global market, and the currency market) may seem like the
newkidontheblock,butithasbeenthemarketofchoiceforglobalhedge
funds and institutional investors for years. The “big money” has always
traded forex, because the huge size of the market allows these traders to
enter and exit large trades without creating price distortions and disrupt-
ing exchange rates. Yet this market seems brand new to many individual
traders,becausethebarrierstoentrythatusedtokeepthelittleguyoutof
theforexmarkethaveonlyrecentlyfallenaway.
Inthepastfewyears,thepopularityofforextradinghastakenoff—and
for good reason. The forex market’s daily volume, estimated at about
U.S.$1.9 trillion and growing, is unmatched by any trading market in the
world.
Forextradersalsohavetheabilitytousetremendousleverage,which
can be greater than 200-to-1. Leverage allows a trader to “magnify” his
or her trading positions, and also serves to magnify gains and losses.

WHY IS FOREX SUDDENLY SO POPULAR?
Traditionally,accesstothismarkethadbeenrestrictedtomajorcorpora-
tions, hedge funds, and other institutional investors. Most of the world’s
majorbanksareheavilyinvolvedintheforeignexchangemarketandhave
been for years. Until recently, the individual trader had no way to access
thismarket,becausetherewasnowaytocompetewiththe“bigboys”on
alevelplayingfield.
In the 1990s, the forex market was finally able to open its doors to
retail clientele. Online forex market makers opened the gates (and made
fortunes),bybreakinghugetradingpositionsinto“bite-sizedchunks”that
individualscouldbuyandsell.
Thismeansthatindividualscannowtradealongsidethebiggestbanks
in the world and even use the same techniques and strategies that pro-
fessional traders use. Suddenly, the trading landscape has changed, and
tradershavea“new”alternativetostockandfuturesmarkets.
HOW DO TRADERS MAKE MONEY IN THE
FOREX MARKET?
Currency traders simply attempt to profit from changes in the exchange
rate.Becauseofthetremendousleverageavailabletoforextraders,avery

Most individuals are interested in the technical aspects of currency
trading and have a tendency to feel intimidated when it comes to funda-
mental analysis. This is probably because charts are a visual device for
patternrecognition,andcanbeinterpretedquicklywithexperience.
Meanwhile,economicsisasubjectthatisusuallypresentedinaman-
nerthatcanbestbedescribedaswordyandboring.Hey,there’sareason
whyeconomicsiscalled“thedismalscience”!
Don’t be intimidated by economics and fundamentals. Generally, the
faultisnotwiththesubject,butwiththemannerofpresentation.
Whilethisbookprimarilydealswiththetechnicalstrategiesandtech-
niques of forex trading, I want to encourage you to think of the technical
andfundamentalaspectsofforexasintertwined.Inotherwords,whatyou
seeonthechart(technical)didn’tjustappearbychance—itistherefora

Unfortunately,mosttraderstendtolookattechnicalandfundamental
analysis as an either/or proposition, but for now I just want to encourage
youtoconsiderthattheyarenotmutuallyexclusive.We’llcoverthiscon-
ceptingreaterdetailasweprogressthroughsometradingtechniques.
WHY DO CURRENCIES TRADE IN PAIRS?
Thisisaconceptthatmanystudentsfindconfusingatfirst,butit’sactually
very simple. Whenever you enter a currency trade, there are two curren-
cies involved. Think about the traveler from our earlier discussion, who
exchanged his homeland’s currency for the currency of the land he was
visiting.You’llrecallthatthereweretwocurrenciesinvolvedinthetrans-
action,butonlyoneexchangerate.
Every foreign exchange transaction, or forex trade, involves two cur-
rencies and one exchange rate. The best way to illustrate the reason for
this is to attempt to initiate a currency transaction that involves just one
currency.Forexample,ifyouliveintheUnitedStates,walkdowntoyour
localgrocerystoreandaskthepersonbehindthecounter,“HowmanyU.S.
dollarswillyougivemeinexchangefor20U.S.dollars?”
After the clerk gives you a sideways look, he’ll assume that you want
change for a twenty, and $20 is exactly what you’ll get—no more and no
less.Nobodyisgoingtoofferyoumorethan$20fora$20bill,soyoucannot

larinyourpocketwillstillbeworth$1tomorrow;however,itsvaluecon-
stantly fluctuates relative to other currencies. This is why we must trade
currenciesinpairs.
HOW CAN I TRADE TWO CURRENCIES AT
ONE TIME?
Many traders find it helpful to think of a currency pair as a single instru-
ment, just likea stock. For example, if an equity trader believes that IBM
stockwillriseinvalue,thattraderwill“golong”IBMstock.
Similarly, if a forex trader believes that the euro will rise against the
U.S.dollar, thattrader can “golong” theeuro/U.S. dollar currency pair.If
thesametraderbelievedthattheeuromightweakenagainsttheU.S.dollar,
heorshecould“sellshort”theeuro/U.S.dollarcurrencypair.
You might hear a currency trader say, “I’m buying the dollar” or “I’m
sellingtheeuro.”Itmaysoundasifthisindividualistradingjustonecur-
rency, but he or she is actually trading two currencies. If you are trading

HOW IS THE TRADING DAY STRUCTURED?
Since the forex market is open 24 hours per day, we can’t really say that
the market opens or closes at a particular time of day. Unlike stock and
futuresmarkets,thereisno“openingbell.”
Since we’ll be working with charts that require an opening price and
a closing price, forex traders must designate a particular timeof day as a
benchmark.
Formosttraders,theforextradingdaybeginsat5:00P.M.EasternU.S.
(New York) time, 10:00 P.M. London time. Because forex trades 24 hours
per day, the trading day also ends at 5:00 P.M. New York time, 10:00 P.M.
Londontime.
Whyisthisparticulartimeused?Considerthatwhenitis5:00 P.M.on
SundayinNewYork,itisMondaymorninginAustraliaandNewZealand.
According to the International Date Line, Monday morning reaches this
partoftheworldbeforeanyotheractiveforextradingarea.Hence,itmarks
thebeginningofthetradingday.
Overall, volume is low at this time of day because the three biggest
forex trading centers—Great Britain, the United States, and Japan—are

The European Session
As the Asian trading day winds down around 3:00 A.M. Eastern U.S. time,
European markets open for business, and the London trading day begins
soon afterward. This is considered to be the beginning of the European
session.

GREENWICH MEAN TIME
How do forex traders keep track of all of these various times of day? Be-
cause forex traders are located everywhere in the world, they use Green-
wich Mean Time (GMT) so that all traders can have a common point of
reference.

Technical
Analysis and the
Forex Market
Whyhavesomanyformerequityandfuturestraderschosentotrade
in the currency markets? Many have discovered that technical
analysis works exceptionally well in the forex markets, and are
reapingthebenefitsoftradingintheglobalmarketplace.Whydoestechni-
calanalysisworksowellintheforexmarket?Technicalanalysisissimply
the analysis of past price movements to help predict future price move-
ments. In many cases, a trader using technical analysis is simply looking
fortherepetitionofpastoccurrences.

These are common concerns of traders who want to experience the
advantages of forex, but are reluctant to leave their “comfort zone.” As
we take a look at charts of forex exchange rates, the first thing that will
becomeapparentisthattheyarenotverydifferentfromthechartsofother
tradingvehicles,suchasstocksorcommodities.
TRADING PATTERNS AND TECHNICAL
INDICATORS
Forexperiencedequitiesandfuturestraders,thegoodnewsisthatnearly
everything you already know about technical analysis can be applied to
theforexmarket.Forexchartscontainfamiliarpatternsliketheheadand
shoulders, double tops and double bottoms, and symmetrical and asym-
metricaltriangles.
Forex traders use moving averages, Bollinger bands, moving average
convergence/divergence (MACD)—all of the same indicators that equity
andfuturestradersuse.Therearebreakoutsandpullbacks,retracements
and consolidations, ranges and trends. For example, Figure 4.1 shows a
patternthatisfamiliartotraderswhousetechnicalanalysis—adoubletop

Strategies involving trend lines and channels are also popular in the
forex markets. For example, in the daily chart of the USD/CHF (U.S.
dollar/Swiss franc) currency pair, we can see two distinct and separate
channels, one moving higher and one moving lower. Note that when the
first channel fails, the uptrend dissolves into a double top, which is then
followedbyadowntrend(seeFigure4.4).

FIBONACCI TECHNIQUES
No overview of forex technical analysis would be complete without a
discussion of Fibonacci techniques. As you may know, Fibonacci was a
famous Italian mathematician who is credited with several major innova-

Once you grow used to the movements in these two pairs, give
USD/JPY and USD/CAD a try. You’ll see that these two currency pairs
moveinacompletelydifferentmannerfromEUR/USDandGBP/USD.The
Japanese yen pairs have their own “personalities” and are more likely to
findsupport/resistanceatroundnumbers.
If you enjoy trading the USD/JPY currency pair, try EUR/JPY. This

COMMODITY CURRENCIES
Next, see if USD/CAD is a pair that you enjoy trading. This has been one
ofmyfavoritesbecauseofitspersistentlong-termtrend.Therelationship
between this currency pair and the price of oil is strong, as the Canadian
dollar often gains ground as energy prices rise, and falls when energy
prices weaken. Currencies that share a strong relationship with the price
of a commodity, such as oil, are called “commodity currencies” (see
Figure5.1).

TRADING AND KARMA
It’sbeensaidthatthereisnobetterplacetoobservehumanbehaviorthan
on a trading desk. When I first worked in that environment in New York,
I heard a comment that I found perplexing. A relatively new trader had
entered the room, strutting and boasting openly and loudly of his recent
successes.
“Ididitagain!Makingmoneyandactingfunny!Iamonfire,baby!Iam
theman!”
Thetraderwentonandonabouthowhewas“alwaysrightontarget”
andjustcouldn’tseemtolose.
Shaking his head at this garish display, an experienced trader seated
nearby turned to the person at the next desk and said, “The market gods
willnotapproveofthis.”
Although I didn’t understand at the time, his meaning soon became
clear: The markets have a tendency to humble those who become too
proud,andthebraggingtraderwastemptingfatebyopenlyrevelinginhis

THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING

When you first begin using new trading techniques, you may be fortunate
enough to experience success right from the start. Perhaps you just hap-

BEGIN WITH A TENDENCY
Almost every good trading strategy has at its heart a market tendency. If
weobservemarketsforlongenough,webegintonoticethesetendencies;
forexample,theforexmarkettendstoformlong,strongtrends.
Anotherexamplewouldbeamarket’stendencytofindsupportorre-

Atruetendencywillbebackedbyreason;forexample,roundnumber
support and resistance occur because people often locate their entries,
stops, and exits right at round numbers. Why do people behave in this
manner?
The fact is, not every trader consults a chart before placing a trade,
andsometradershaveverygeneralideasaboutwheretheywishtoplace
theirorders.Thesetradersoftenplaceentry,exit,andstopordersatround
numbers, and their orders congregate at these levels. Because of this,
round numbers often coincide with key support and resistance levels in
theequityandfuturesmarkets,aswellasintheforexmarkets.

Contrast this with a weak or false tendency, which is usually the re-
sult of a superficial observation. An example of a false tendency would
be a statement such as, “The euro is always strong on Thursday” or “The
Canadian dollar is volatile when the moon is full.” Such an observation
probably occurred over a short period of time and has no basis in logical
reasoning. Actually, I wouldn’t consider these examples to be tendencies

SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY
Not all trends are created equal. The best trends are the ones that jump

Like many aspects of technical analysis, trends that are obvious tend
to work well because many traders can see and identify them. If enough

traders then place orders that reflect their belief that the currency pair is
trending,thisprovidesadditionalfuelforthetrend.
This is an example of the “self-fulfilling prophecy,” a prediction that,
in being made, actually causes itself to become true. In other words,
if traders believe that a currency pair is in an uptrend, many of them
will go long in an attempt to take advantage of the trend. The resulting
buying pressure drives the pair higher, reinforcing the trend. The self-
fulfilling prophecy is a recurring theme in technical analysis and in forex
trading.

Can a trend be too strong? A huge run-up in a stock, commodity,
or currency can potentially lead to a steep correction. Be aware of sit-
uations where a trading instrument has already garnered massive gains.
However, if a trader is using good risk management and is using stops
properly, and is trading in a highly liquid environment such as the spot
forex market, the amount of risk in any situation can be reduced and
controlled.

HOW TO DETERMINE IF THE

Thereareseveralcommontechniquesusedtodetermineifatrendisinef-

referred to as the proper order of moving averages, which was discussed
inanearlierchapter.
Anotherwaytodetermineifacurrencypairistrendingisbyusingthe
averagedirectionalindex(ADX)indicator.TheADXindicator,createdby
the prolific J. Welles Wilder, indicates the strength of the trend without
regardtothedirectionofthetrend(upwardordownward).Highreadings
indicate strong trends; for example, the ADX indicator’s giving a reading
above 35 and rising would be an indication of a strongly trending market
(seeFigure6.8).
Yetanotherwaytodetermineifthemarketistrendingisthroughthe
use of trend lines. A trend line is simply a line that is drawn beneath an
uptrend, or above a downtrend, and indicates the general direction of a

The Anatomy
of a Trend
Perhapsyouhaveheardthesaying,“Thetrendisyourfriend.”Thisis
oneoftheoldestsayingsonWallStreet,andthereisgoodreasonfor
its popularity. Trading with the trend is one of the most profitable
andtime-honoredmethodsusedtotradeanymarket,butitisparticularly

has a tendency to form strong trends that can last for weeks, months, or
evenyears.
Whyareforextrendssomuchstrongerandlongerlastingthantrends
in other markets? Consider the differences between trends in the equity
marketversustrendsintheforexmarket.

The perceived economic strength or weakness of an economy is usu-
ally reflected in the underlying currency. Since Forex trading involves
matching two currencies against one another, situations often arise in
which one currency is much stronger than the other currency in the pair.

thisisexactlywhatwewanttoavoiddoing.
This is just human nature; it is much easier for us as human beings
to imagine the price returning to a level that is still fresh in our recent
memory, as opposed to imagining the price rising to levels that have not
been seen in years. Yet that is exactly what happened in the USD/JPY
trend.

Inanuptrend,thispullbackcanoccurasthepricefallsbacktowarda
prior level of support, or perhaps to a Fibonacci retracement level. Large
round numbers can often act as psychological support or resistance as
well, because orders tend toaccumulate atthese levels. InFigure 7.4, we
can see three examples of support levels that formed during the uptrend.
Noticethatseveralofthelevelsalsocorrespondwithlargeroundnumbers.
Fibonacci can be a useful tool for determining a point of entry dur-
ing an uptrend. The concept of Fibonacci is that a directional move in a
marketwilloftenretracebyacertainpercentage.AccordingtoFibonacci,
the most important retracement levels are 38.2 percent, 50 percent, and
61.8 percent. We can see that during the uptrend in the USD/JPY pair,
there were several pullbacks to the key 38.2 percent retracement level.
Thesepullbacksservedasexcellentopportunitiestoenterinthedirection
of the trend, as the price often finds support at these retracement levels
(Figure7.5).

I recommend waiting for the oscillator to drop from the over-
bought level and into neutral territory. This is often an early indica-
tion that the momentum is turning, and a counter move may be in the
offing.

located above 1.1250. This also satisfies our requirement that the stop
should be located above the recent high of 1.1245. If we place the stop
at 1.1260, the stop will be located above the recent high and above the
Fibonaccilevel,givingourtradeadditionalprotection(seeFigure8.8).
Theentrypointof1.1225,alongwiththestopat1.1260,createsriskof

Next, we’ll look for areas of prior support (meaning areas that the
exchange rate had difficulty penetrating on earlier attempts, due to buy-
ers stepping in at those levels). Looking back, we can see that the price
bounced repeatedly from 1.1100, which is also a round number (round

exit(seeFigure8.10).

A further look shows that the price had difficulty getting through the
area of 1.0975 on several occasions. Let’s designate this area for our final
exit(seeFigure8.11).
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD
Let’s take a closer look at those last two exits and think about how they
canbeimproved.Whenwearetradingintherealworld,doestheexchange
ratealwaysfalltotheexactlevelofsupport,oraremarketsslightlymore
randomthanthis?
If you’ve been trading in the real world, you know that the exchange
rate or price rarely falls repeatedly to the exact same level of support or
consistentlyrisestoanexactlevelofresistance.Sometimesthepricefalls
below the anticipated support level, and sometimes it doesn’t quite make
itallthewaydown.
This is why we say that support and resistance are “areas,” not exact
pricepoints,andweneedtouse“softtargets”insteadofassumingmarkets
willperformtopreciseexpectations.
TWEAKING THE EXITS
When we consider the true nature of trading and acknowledge that there
is a certain degree of randomness to any trading market, it becomes

necessary to adjust our exits. Instead of expecting the exchange rate to
cooperateandreachthe“bottom”ofsupportatexactly1.1100,let’stweak
thisexittoimproveourchancesofsuccess.
According to the daily chart, major resistance is located at 1.1250,
basedonthe38.2percentFibonacciretracementthatwediscussedearlier.
Since a support level is located at 1.1100, this would constitute a 150-pip
rangefromsupporttoresistance(1.1250−1.1100=150).
Let’sraiseourexitbyanamountequivalentto10%ofthatrange,which
would be 15 pips (10% of 150 pips). This pushes our second exit higher,
from1.1100to1.1115.(seeFigure8.12).
This has the dual effect of placing our exit in a location where it is
more likely to be reached, above the very bottom of support, and it also
allows us to exit ahead of the round number of 1.1100. Round numbers
oftenactaspsychologicalsupportorresistancelevels,becauseorderstend

the distance from support to resistance, which is approximately 275 pips
(1.1250−1.0975=275).

let’sraisethisexitby28pips,to1.1003.Again,thiswillraisetheexittoan

In this case, it’s true that the original exits were reached. Does that
mean it was wrong to raise the exits? Should we change our strategy so
thatnexttimewewillnotadjusttheexits?
Absolutelynot!Theoutcomeofanyoneindividualtradeisnotimpor-
tant,whatmattersistheoutcomeoveralargesampleoftrades.Ifwewere
to change our approach every time things didn’t go exactly according to

In fact, we would not be following a trading strategy at all! Instead,
wewouldexistinaperpetualstateofsecond-guessing.Toavoidthisfate,
all we have to do is plan our trade and then execute our plan. If we are
following a good trading plan, we will be pleased with the overall result,

WHEN TO STAY OUT
Sincethepairisrisingupfromsupport,shouldweenteralongtradeand
try to profit from a possible bounce? The answer is no. If you recall, the
original plan was to trade only in the direction of the trend and to reject
tradesthatgoagainstthetrend.

Because of this, a large group of orders located together in one area

Remember the breakout traders who went long as the exchange rate
climbed above 1.1250? How are they feeling now that the price has fallen
below their entry point? They are feeling regret and discomfort, and are
considering exiting the trade. Perhaps their stops are being triggered as

The FX-Ed Trend
Technique
Earlier, we compared a trend to a river, and we noted that it is eas-
ier to paddle in the direction of the current than it is to fight our
way upstream. Each river has its own current, and the strength of
that current can, and sometimes does, change. Sometimes a drought will
dry the flow to a trickle, bringing the river to a near standstill. At other
times,greatstormswillcausefloodsandturntheriverintoanunstoppable
force.
Howshouldweapproachatrendingmarketsituationwhentheusual
“current” becomes a roaring, foaming whitewater rapid? We’ve already
looked at techniques for trading with the trend, but there are times when
trends can become overwhelmingly strong and require a more aggressive
approach.Whydosometrendsbecomesostrong?
TRENDS ARE SELF-SUSTAINING
One reason this happens is that the longer a market trends, the more ob-
vious that trend becomes. The longer duration makes it easier for other
participants to identify the trend and join in. As more and more traders
climb aboard in the same direction, the trend accelerates and takes on a
lifeofitsown.
Theactionbecomesself-sustaining,astraderswhoareseekingtotake
advantage of the trend are in effect forcing the trend to continue. This is
oneofthereasonswhytrendstendtocontinueforlongerperiodsoftime

DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
Another reason to consider is that since each currency pair contains two
currencies, we are sometimes faced with an imbalance in the perception
of the economies of those two countries. Perhaps one economy is per-
ceived as strong, and traders perceive that it will become even stronger.
This strength, or perceived strength, will be reflected in the currency of
thatcountry.Asaresult,thecurrencyofthatcountryrallies.
Atthesametime,theoppositemaybetruefortheopposingcurrency;
traders may believe that the economy is weak and perhaps it will grow
weaker.Thisperceivedweaknesswouldbereflectedinthecurrencyofthat
country,andasaresultthelattercurrencywouldsufferincomparisonto
theformercurrency.
Ifthereisavastlydifferentperceptioninthestrengthand/orweakness
of the two currencies in the pair, the exchange rate must move to reflect
this disparity. Sometimes, the exchange rate must rise or fall a great dis-
tancebeforetheseperceptionsarefullyreflected.
BIG MONEY AT WORK
If a trend is very strong and persistent, it’s likely that the “big money” of
institutional traders is at work. Let’s face it; the forex market is so huge
that a strong trend cannot be sustained for long without the tremendous
amountsofcapitalthesebigplayerspourintothemarket.Thisisverydif-
ferentfromtheequitymarket,whereafewindividualsplacinglargeorders
candrivethepriceactivityofanilliquidstock.
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR
If we observe past situations where currency pairs have launched into
strong trends, we can find some common denominators. One of these is
the tendency for the exchange rate to pull back to a key moving average
beforeresumingthetrend.
In particular, there is considerable evidence that in extremely strong
trends, pullbacks (in the case of an uptrend) or rallies (in the case of a

most of the major currencies, and on many of the charts at that time the
10-dayEMAwasclearlycomingintoplay.Whydoesthiskeephappening?
Institutional traders are buying on the dips in the case of an uptrend,
or selling the rallies during a downtrend. The 10-day moving average is a
convenient location for these big players to either open new positions or
add to existing positions during a runaway trend. They are entering the
tradeinthedirectionofthetrend,butbywaitingfortheexchangerateto

By adding this filter, we can avoid entering trades if the big players
are not sufficiently committed to adding to their positions. If the major
players are hesitant about increasing the size of their positions, they may
not be the “strong hands” that are necessary to keep this trend moving

currencypairs.
VOLATILITY STOP
This volatility will be the basis for determining the location of our stop.
There are several indicators that are designed to reflect and measure the
volatility of a trading instrument, and one of the most popular of these
indicatorsistheaveragetruerange(ATR)indicator.
This is one of an array of indicators created by J.Welles Wilder, and
wasintroducedinhisbookNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems
(Trend Research, 1978). It simply measures the average movement for a
currencypair(orstock,orcommodity)duringthetimeframethatisbeing
measured(inthiscase,thedailychart).Wilderrecommendeda14-period
defaultformeasuringATR,sothatiswhatwewilluseforthisstrategy.

Let’s think about this for a minute: One currency pair moves about
148pipsperday,andtheothermovesabout35pipsperday.Imaginethat
a protective stop is placed at an appropriate distance (i.e., “x” number of
pips)foronepair.Wouldastopplacedatthisdistancealsobeappropriate
fortheother,ifthetwopairsareinsimilarsituations?
COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES
The answer is: most definitely not. Consider a 30-pip stop; this might be
consideredaclosestopfortheGBP/USDcurrencypair,because30pipsis
equal to just about 20 percent of the average daily range of that pair (148
pips). Meanwhile, a 30-pip stop could be considered a wide stop for the
EUR/GBPpair,becauseitisequaltonearly90percentofthepair’saverage
dailyrangeof35pips.
Because of this, a 30-pip stop (or any fixed number of pips) cannot
beconsideredaneffectivestopineverysituation,becausevolatilityvaries
so widely from one currency pair to another. While we can’t use a fixed
number of pips in an effective manner, we can use the ATR indicator to
helpcalculatethelocationofourstop.
Consider the difference in ATR readings in the above example;
GBP/USD’s average daily range is more than four times the average daily
rangeofEUR/GBP.Soitstandstoreasonthat,allotherthingsbeingequal,

allows us to make an “apples to apples” comparison of the two currency
pairs,andcompensatesforthevariableofvolatility.
ATR CALCULATION
Forourstrategy,wewilluse50percentofthedailyATRtodeterminethe
location of our stop. Since thisstrategy is based on the theory of support
(inthecaseofalongtrade)atthe10-dayEMA,wewillplacethestopunder
the10-dayexponentialmovingaveragebyanamountofpipsequivalentto

Huge Potential
Ifwearefortunateandthepaircontinuestrendingstrongly,thepotential
exists for a big winning trade. When we enter a trade of this nature, the
best-case scenario would be that the pair continues to trend for a very
long time. When this happens, the size of a winning trade can become
astounding.
In this example, we see the EUR/USD currency pair is in an uptrend.
The moving averages are in the proper order for an uptrend, and the ex-
change rate has remained above the 10-day EMA for at least 10 days (see
Figure9.11).Wehavemetthenecessarycriteriatoenterthetrade.

under the 10-day EMA, which has been touched only sporadically since
our “close call” on Day 5. There have been no incursions of more than a
few pips since then, and clearly, big traders are “loading the boat” every
timetheexchangeratedropstothemovingaverage.
The10-dayEMAisnowallthewayupto1.3256,andtheATR,bolstered
bytheincreaseinvolatility,hasrisento118pipsperday(notshown).118

All good things must come to an end, and this trade is no different.
Two days later, on Day 29, the moving average has climbed to 1.3308
(see Figure 9.21). The ATR has backed off a bit to 112, so our stop will
beplaced56pips(50percentof112)beneaththemovingaverage,at1.3252.

MORE THAN ONE CHANCE
Even long before the Hussein trade, there were numerous chances to go
long this pair, based on this technique. Looking back over a four-month
periodinFigure9.27,noticehowmanytimestheGBP/USDcurrencypair
bouncedoffofthemovingaverage.
Thoughnoteverytradewouldhavebeensuccessful,thereweremany
chances for profitable long trades. Also, the size of the losing trades
would be limited by the protective stop. There is no limit to the size of
the winning trades, since we are allowing the trends to run until they
collapse.
The same is true with our earlier EUR/USD example. Notice how the

However, there are techniques that we can apply to this strategy to
create partial exits. Before we get into this partial exit technique, I want
youtotryanexercisethatisnotapartofthistradingstylethatwillteach
youavaluablelessonabouttradingwiththetrend.
DISCRETIONARY AND STRATEGIC EXITS
When you are practicing this technique in a demo account (and I highly
recommendthatyoupracticeeverytechniquethatyoulearnrepeatedlyin
ademoaccount),trythefollowingexercise:Youcanexithalfofthetrade
atanypointthatyouwish,aslongasyouexitthesecondhalfofthetrade
onlyinthemannerdescribedintheFX-EdTrendTechnique.
In other words, you can exit half of the position at any time, for any
reason,aslongasyoufollowthetechniquecorrectlywiththesecondhalf
ofthetrade,bytrailingthestopunderneaththe10-dayEMA.Wewillrefer
tothefirstexitasa“discretionaryexit”andthesecondexitasthe“strategic

track of your results in a trading journal. After you have done this for a
while,mostofyouwillnoticethatthediscretionaryexitisrarelyasgood
asthestrategicexit.Whydoesthishappen?
FAULTY WIRING
The reason is that, as human beings, we are wired to exit our trades too
quickly. Think about the examples that we reviewed earlier; how many
peopledoyouthinkwillholdontoaprofitabletradelongenoughtogain
hundredsofpips?Thefactisthatfewofushavethedisciplinetoholdon

trendingtrade,evenwhenwe“feel”thatweshouldgetout.Lefttoourown
devices,wewillalmostalwaysexitourgoodtradestoosoonandholdon
toourbadtradesfortoolong.
Just in case anyone is not clear on this, I do not recommend exiting
half of the position at your discretion once you are trading this style in a
liveaccount.Thisisanexercise,thepurposeofwhichistoteachusthis:
We will be better off if we simply follow the plan and disregard our own
opinionsorfeelingsaboutthetrade.

Here is one way to take partial exits using this technique: When the

Atthesametime,theexchangerateislikelytobeextendedfaraway

been blessed with a significant gain, sometimes in a very short period of
time. If this is the case, feel free to use the channel line to take a partial
profit.

You can exit half of the position at or near the channel line, but you
must hold the other half of the trade and trail the stop using the 10-day
EMA,asdescribedpreviously.
RELOADING
It was noted earlier that there might be multiple opportunities to enter
a trade using this technique. We can use these additional entry points to
“reload”thetradeattheappropriatetime,usingthefollowingrule:
If we have already closed half of the position at or near the channel
line,wemayreplacethatportionofthetradeiftheexchangeratefalls
back to the moving average, creating a new entry point. We may not

add a full position; we can only replace the portion of the trade that

IMPORTANT POINTS TO CONSIDER
In the examples given, all of the trades take place on a daily chart. This
isbecausethetradeisbasedonanimportantmarkettendencythatdeals
withthebehaviorofinstitutionaltraders.Wehaveseenevidencethatinsti-
tutionsaddtopositionsatthe10-dayexponentialmovingaverage.
Wishful Thinking
However,thereisnoevidencethatthebigplayersinthismarketaddtopo-
sitionsatthe10-hourmovingaverage,oratthe10-minutemovingaverage.
Yet I always encounter traders who try to adapt this system for shorter-
term trades. This serves only to render the trade meaningless, as there is
absolutelynoindicationthatthisstyleoftradingshouldworkinanytime
frameotherthanthedaily.
The big institutional players tend to be oriented to daily and weekly
charts, and are rarely concerned with intraday time frames. They are the
oneswhoarecreatingsupportandresistanceatthe10-dayEMA.Let’snot
ruinagoodtechniquebecausewewishitweresomethingotherthanwhat
itreallyis.

ically prepared to work your way through some losing trades in order to
get to a big winner. Don’t fall into the trap of judging this technique on a
few trades, whether they are successful or not. As with any trading tech-

It’s important that we think of support and resistance as areas. In a
perfect world, the exchange rate would always rise and fall to the same
exact price points, over and over again. The world of trading is far from
perfect,andpricesrarelyriseandfalltotheexactsamespot.

WHY SUPPORT BECOMES RESISTANCE
Ifsupportandresistanceheldforever,thentradingwouldbeeasyindeed.
We could simply enter and exit as the price ping-pongs up and down be-
tweensupportandresistancelevels.Ofcourse,theideathattradingcould
besosimpleiswishfulthinking.
Let’s consider the process that occurs when support breaks. Imagine
that a support level exists that has withstood numerous tests; in other
words, the exchange rate has repeatedly fallen to a price area, only to
bouncebackupeverytime.Thereasonwhythepricebouncesbackisthat
buyers are stepping in at that level on repeated occasions. These buyers
could be institutional traders, individual traders, or a combination of the
two.
Every time that these traders have entered long positions at the sup-
portlevel,themarkethasrewardedthem;wecouldsaythatthey’vebeen
conditionedbythemarkettoenterattheareaofsupport.Oneday,thelevel
istestedagain,andtraderseitherinitiateoraddtotheirlongpositions.
Only this time the price breaks through, and now traders who en-
tered long at support find that their positions are “under water.” Many
of these traders will be taken out of their positions by protective stops,
which are generally located beneath support for those who are entering
longintheareaofsupport.However,sinceweknowthatnotalltradersuse
stops,someoftheseindividualswillnowbegintoexperiencesomeserious
anxiety.
There is a wonderful thing that we can do as we analyze any trading
situation: We can try to understand how the situation feels to those who
aredirectlyinvolved.Perhapsatsomepointinthepast,beforelearningthe
importance of risk management, we may have been ensnared in a similar

If the price then rises up near to the entry point (the former support

PRICE ACTION
Traders are not only concerned with the ability (or lack thereof) of the
pricetobreakthroughsupportorresistance,butarealsoconcernedwith
the behavior of the price when it reaches these key levels. They want to
knownotonlyif supportorresistanceisholding,butalsohowitisholding.
For example, did the price make a half-hearted attempt at breaching
support, and then drift away, or did it fail repeatedly in its persistent at-
temptstobreakouttotheotherside?
Howisthepricemoving?Isitrushingheadlongtowardsupportorre-
sistance, indicating a strong commitment on the part of traders? Or is it

The “attitude” of the price at key support and resistance levels can
betray the next directional move. I never want to enter a trade based on
supportorresistanceunlessIcanfirstobservethepriceaction.
For example, if a pair repeatedly fails after numerous attempts to
breach resistance, it reveals the presence of a large seller in the vicinity.

Another edge that we can put to use when trading intraday breakouts is
the time of day. Perhaps you are familiar with the trading axiom that a

consideredlessreliableifitoccursonlowvolume.
This is because it takes “real money” to generate a move that occurs
onhighvolume.Inahigh-volumeenvironment,themoveisconsideredreal

While forex traders are not able to easily access accurate volume fig-
ures,wedoknow thattradingisnotequallyliquidatalltimesoftheday,
andtherearecertainlysometimesofdaythatgeneratemorevolumethan
others.
For example, since we know that the London session has the highest
volume, we’ll consider breakouts that occur during this session to be le-
gitimate. We would especially consider these breakouts to be significant
if they occur early in the session, as this is the time of day that normally
generatesthehighestvolumeandthegreatestliquidity.

a time of high volume is legitimate, and a breakout that occurs at a time
of low volume is suspect. Remember, although we cannot see the actual

Finally, during the June 24 session, the pair suddenly tries to break
support. However, we can see in the five-minute chart (Figure 11.7) that

Atraderwhopaidattentiontothetimeofdaywouldhavenotedthat

In other words, the trader is assuming that the low-volume breakout will
fail.
Oneweeklater,onJuly1,thepairtriedtobreakthesupportlevelonce
again, only this time the breakout occurred at approximately 14:30 GMT
(see Figure 11.8). At this time of day, the London session is ongoing, and
theNewYorksessioniswellunderway.

formation of one of these patterns, the exchange rate has a tendency
to continue moving in the same direction as it was prior to the con-
solidation. These patterns are generally found on short-term or intraday
charts.
In the case of a flag or a pennant, the initial move is a sudden, sharp
directionalthrust.Itdoesn’tmatterifthemoveisanadvanceoradecline,
what matters is the velocity of the move. This sharp burst creates a long
candleoraseriesoflongcandlesonourshort-termchart,andisreferred
to as a flagpole. If the movement is not sharp or sudden, the reliability of
the pattern is called into question. The sharp movement, either higher or
lower,iswhatgivestheformationitsmeaning.

The first step to trading the formation is to measure the flagpole (see
Figure 12.2). In this case, the flagpole is a single long candle, and has a
rangeof100pipsfromlowtohigh(thelowofthecandleis1.2727,thehigh
is1.2827).
Next,astheexchangerateconsolidatesintoatriangle,we’lldetermine
theentrypointforourprospectivetrade.Inordertodothis,we’llcalculate
an amount equal to 10 percent of the height of the flagpole.In this case,
10percentwouldbeequalto10pips(theheightoftheflagpole=100pips;
10percentof100pips=10pips).

Then,we’llplaceourentryorderabovethehighpointoftheflagpole.
Since the high point of the flagpole is 1.2827, we’ll simply add 10 percent
(inthiscase,10pips)tothetopoftheflagpole,givingusanentrypointof
1.2837(seeFigure12.3).
Of course, if we do enter a trade, we’ll need to place a stop. The
stop is calculated by using a number of pips that is equivalent to 25
percent of the flagpole. So, since the height of the flagpole is 100 pips,
the stop will be placed 25 pips below the entry point (see Figure 12.4).

This sudden change in the exchange rate attracted sellers, who no
doubtbelievedthat“whatgoesupmustcomedown.”Ofcourseweknow
that this is not necessarily the case, as the law of gravity does not hold
sway over any trading market. As the buyers and sellers achieved tempo-

Next,thetradercalculatesthatthestopmustbeequalto25percentof

will be located at 1.8270, or 50 pips below the entry point of 1.8320 (see

Finally, the exchange rate breaks out of the pennant formation. Our

FLAGS
Flag formations are very similar to pennants, in that both begin with a
sharp move (called a flagpole) followed by a period of consolidation.
Both are also continuation patterns, meaning that the most likely resolu-
tion of the consolidation will be a breakout in the same direction as the
flagpole.
Here is the main difference between a pennant and a flag: a pen-
nant consists of two lines that slope toward each other (similar to a
symmetricaltriangle),whileaflagconsistsoftwoparallellinesthatslope

Flags are traded in a manner that is very similar to the method used
to trade pennants. First, we measure the flagpole, which has a height of
about150pips,beginningat1.3100andtoppingoutatabout1.3250(seeFig-
ure 12.13). Our entry will be at a point above the flagpole, by an amount
equalto10percentoftheflagpole.Since10percentof150pips=15pips,
we will place our entry order at 1.3265, which is 15 pips above the top of
theflagpole.

the entry point, not 38 pips below the top of the flagpole. By using this

suddenly a sharp move higher occurs, creating a flagpole (see Figure

120pips.

THE CYCLE OF VOLATILITY
Volatility tends to run in cycles. In other words, periods of high volatil-
ity tend to be followed by periods of low volatility. There is a simple ex-
planation for this; when a market is trending, as the forex market often
does, the participants have a definite opinion as to the direction of the
trade.
Thiscyclecanbeobservedinalmostanytradingmarket,butit’smost

contracts during periods of high volatility, to collect the “premium”—the
costofthecontract.Thepremiumsattachedtothesecontractstendtobe

PERCEPTION MOVES THE MARKET
When a currency pair begins to trend, traders are showing a strong pref-
erence for one currency over another. During strong trends, the market
is volatile because the price is on the move. The perception of value has
changed,andthepricemustmovetoreflectthischangeofopinion.
After the trend has continued for a while, the currency pair will
reach a point where the participants feel that the exchange rate is fairly
valued. There will come a point when the bulls and the bears reach
an agreement—at least temporarily—that a currency pair is reasonably
priced.
Atthispoint,thetrendpauses andthepairentersaperiodofconsol-
idation. The price settles into a narrow range, as there is no real reason
for the exchange rate to break out one way or the other. The period of
consolidationmaybebrieforlengthy.

Euro and U.S. Dollar Fundamentals
At the same time that European nations were experiencing these difficul-
ties, the United States was enjoying relatively strong growth and an im-
provingemploymentpicture.
TheU.S.FederalReservewasinthemidstofacampaignofratehikes,
which have the effect of strengthening the U.S. dollar by making U.S.-
denominated bonds and other fixed-income instruments more attractive
tooverseasinvestors.Thiscreatesaflowofcapitalintoacountrythatof-
fershigh-yieldinginvestments,whichstrengthenstheunderlyingcurrency
(inthiscasetheU.S.dollar).
Because U.S. interest rates at that time were higher than European
rates, traders who were long theU.S. dollar and short theeuro were able
toearninterestonthetrade,inadditiontoanycapitalappreciation.
Conversely, traders who were long the euro versus the U.S. dollar
wouldhavetopayinterest.Atthetime,itseemedthattherewereplentyof
goodreasonstobuythegreenback,butfewcompellingreasonstoownthe
euro.
These events gave traders a strong opinion as to the relative value of
these two currencies, and traders mercilessly dumped the euro in favor
of the U.S. dollar. The euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate fell sharply, from
nearly 1.35 on March 11 to below 1.19 on July 5, a plunge of nearly 1,600
pips.
By mid-July, traders apparently felt that the euro had been punished
enough, and by latesummer the pair settledinto aperiod of relatively di-
rectionlessandnarrowtrading.Itwastimetostartlookingforavolatility

Moving Averages and Volatility
Many traders use moving averages as an indication of volatility. In
Figure 13.1, we see that the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) is

indicatorisfalling,meaningthattheaveragedailyrangeisshrinking,and
volatilityisdecreasing.
Bollinger bands also measure volatility. Bollinger bands split open
when volatility is high and converge when volatility falls. Instead of us-
ing the bands themselves, we can use the Bollinger band width indicator,
which is simply a measure of the space between the Bollinger bands. We

A subsequent area of resistance would be 1.2675, the 50 percent Fi-
bonacci retracement level of the same downtrend. Again, if we reach the
first exit point, we can exit half of the position and raise the stop to the
breakevenpointontheremainingportionofthetrade.
Longer Consolidation Equals Stronger Breakout
The longer the amount of time spent in the consolidation phase, the
strongerthebreakouttendstobe.Whywouldthisbetrue?Considerthat
duringthetimethatthepriceistradinginanarrowrange,therearebuyers
andsellerstakingpositions.
Because the price is not moving very much, these traders have lit-
tle reason to exit their trades. But if the price breaks out in either di-
rection, there are likely to be a large number of traders who are caught
on the “wrong side” of the market, regardless of the direction of the
breakout. As these traders cover their positions, they provide fuel for the
breakout, helping to push the price further away from the consolidation
area.
OnThursday,September1,2005,aweakU.S.economicreportserved
as the catalyst as the euro/U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) pair blasted out of the
areaofconsolidationandracedtothefirsttargetforlongtrades(seeFig-
ure 13.5). The currency pair reached a high of 1.2525 on the day of the
breakout, as volatility returned with a vengeance—the 200-pip move was
nearlydoubletheaveragedailyrange.

Althoughthisparticularexampleoccursonthedailychart,similarse-
tups also occur in other time frames. The logic behind the setup, and the
forexmarket’stendencytobreakoutafteraperiodofconsolidation,holds
trueinbothlongandshorttimeframes.
VOLATILITY BREAKOUT STRATEGY
In this example, the Great Britain pound/U.S. dollar (GBP/USD) currency
pair is in a strong downtrend in late 2005. By the spring of 2006, the pair
hadsettledintoatightconsolidation(seeFigure13.6).
As the pair transitions from high to low volatility, the 20-period EMA
beginsmovingsideways.Theflat20-periodEMAisoneindicationthatthe
trendhas paused, at least temporarily, and thepricehas entered thecon-
solidationphase.
Inordertoconfirmthatatradeissettingup,thetraderaddstheATR

dicator is falling, meaning that the average daily range is shrinking. The

Trendlinesarethenaddedtocreateentrypoints,andtodeterminethe
location of stops. As the trendlines are added to the chart, a symmetrical
trianglebecomesevident(seeFigure13.8).
The next step will be to determine exit points. Since we don’t know
thedirectionofthenextmove,wehavetoprepareforapotentialbreakout
in either direction. In order to create exits, we will use prior support and
resistance levels, round numbers, and Fibonacci retracement levels (see
Figure13.9).

Repeating Pattern
Traderswillseethissetupoccuroverandoveragain(seeFigure13.11).It
works so well because of the recurring cycle of volatility, which is made
constant by human behavior. Markets may change over time and traders
may come and go, but human nature remains basically the same. It is hu-
man nature that creates these market tendencies, and the trading tech-
niques that recognize these tendencies will be useful for many years to
come.

Or was it? More than seven years later, in September of 2006, the
widely followed index was trading at around 11,000. Investors who went
long at the peak of the Dow 10,000 frenzy had little to show for it, a gain
ofabout10percentoverthecourseofsevenyears.Thesesameinvestors

Why are we fascinated by so-called round numbers? Some scientists
believe that humans created a “base-10” numeric system because we are
born with 10 fingers and 10 toes. Because of this, we began to think in
termsoffactorsof10.
WHY ROUND NUMBERS ARE EFFECTIVE
Investorsandtradershaveastrongtendencytoplaceordersthatcoincide
with round numbers. Perhaps at some point you’ve heard an analyst say,
“Iwould recommend buying stock XYZ if it falls to $20,” or “Iwould be a
sellerofstockXYZat$40.”
ImaginethatmanytradershaveplacedbuyordersforstockXYZat$20
per share, because they believe the stock is a bargain at that price. If the
pricefallsto$20,whatwillhappen?
Atthatpoint,thestockwillencounteralargepoolofbuyorders.When
theseordersaretriggered,theycanunleashatremendousamountofbuy-
ing power. When buyers outnumber or are more aggressive than sellers,
thepricerises.
Essentially,thebuyershavecreatedasupportlevelat$20,becauseof
themanyordersthathaveaccumulatedatthatlevel.Tradersrefertothis
aspsychologicalsupport,becauseitisnotbasedonanypriorpriceaction.
Although we used an imaginary stock in this example, this phe-
nomenon is very real and occurs in all forms of trading, especially in the
forex market. Why are currencies, commodities, and stocks all subject to

In early 2006, euro/U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) buyers stepped in repeat-
edly in the vicinity of 1.2700 (see Figure 14.2). Traders who used these
roundnumbersasentrypointswererewardedhandsomely.Let’slookata

You might recall from an earlier strategy that a large pool of orders
can create an attractive target, because banks earn commissions when
their customers’ orders are executed. Because orders tend to congregate
atroundnumbers,wewilltakethistendencyintoconsiderationwhencre-
atingourstrategy.
THE FIRST BOUNCE IS THE BEST BOUNCE
Thetimeframeswillbeunusuallyshortforthisdaytradingstrategy.This
is because the first bounce off of round number support or resistance is
usually the best bounce, so we want to be certain that we are witnessing
the first bounce. Longer time frames can hide multiple bounces within a
singlecandle,sotheycannotbeusedinthisstrategy.
Every time the exchange rate reaches the round number, orders are
executed,andthepoolofordersthatcreatesthesupportorresistancelevel
isdiminished.Oncetheamountofordersremainingisnolongersufficient
to repel the exchange rate, it’s not unusual for the support or resistance

Thisiswhyit’simportantthatwearetradingthefirstbounceoffofthe

The pair continues to run toward the figure of 1.1400. By the time it
reaches this point, the pair is extended more than 20 pips above the 20-
period SMA. The trader enters a short position, in the vicinity of 1.1400
(seeFigure14.5).
In this case the pair has a spread of 4 pips, so our stop is located at
1.1419 (15 pips, plus the 4-pip spread, above the entry point). Remember;

Sinceinstitutionalmoneyistheso-called“smartmoney,”wecanlearn
from their techniques and adapt them to our own trading. The individual
long-term forex trader can use the same techniques, and garner the same
benefits,thathedgefundsandinstitutionshaveenjoyedforyears.
INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIALS
Theheartofthistechniqueliesininterestratearbitrage,andinthefactthat
everycurrencyhasacorrespondingrateofinterest.Thisrateisdetermined
by the central bank of the nation or nations that use the currency. For
example,theFederalReservesetsU.S.interestrates,whiletheEuropean
Central Bank determines the interest rate for Germany, France, and the
othernationsoftheEuropeanMonetaryUnion.

everycase,onecurrencyhasahigheryieldthantheothermemberofthe

Here is the edge that the big institutional traders seek to exploit; in
everyforextrade,thetraderislongonecurrencyandshortonecurrency.
The trader who is long the higher yielding of the two currencies collects
interestonthetrade.
Conversely,thetraderwhoisshortthehigheryieldingofthetwocur-
rencies must pay interest. The amount of interest that the trader either
collects or pays is based on the interest rate differential, which is simply
thedifferenceininterestratesbetweenthetwocurrencies.
HERE’S HOW IT WORKS
AssumethatatradeisplacedinthefictionalcurrencypairABC/XYZ.The
interest rate for currency ABC is 4.0 percent, while the rate for currency
XYZis1.0percent.
Therefore, ABC is the higher yielding of the two currencies. Traders
whoarelongABCandshortXYZwillcollect3.0percentinterest,whichis
thedifferentialbetweenABCandXYZ(4.0percent−1.0percent=3.0per-
cent).Remember,youmustbelongthehigher-yieldingcurrencytocollect
interest.

Iknowthisseemssimple,butthereismuchmoretothisstrategythan
simply matching up a high-yielding currency against a low-yielding cur-
rency.Ideally,tradersusethisstrategywhentheycanidentifyasituation
wheretheinterestratedifferentialislikelytoexpandovertime.
Thiswouldresultinanevengreaterpayoffforthetraderwhoislong

apparent that the differential will stop growing or become smaller in the
future.
CHANGING DIFFERENTIALS
Let’s revisit the previous example. Assume again that we are trading cur-
rency pair ABC/XYZ, and we are collecting interest because we are long
currencyABCandshortcurrencyXYZ.
IftheeconomyofABCisstrong,ABC’scentralbankislikelytoraisein-
terestratestocontaingrowthandcontrolinflation.Whenthecentralbank
takes action, ABC’s interest rate rises from 4.0 percent to 4.25 percent,
causingthedifferentialtowidenfrom3.0percentto3.25percent(4.25per-
cent−1.0percent=3.25percent).
Similarly,iftheeconomyofcurrencyXYZisweak,thenXYZ’scentral
bankislikelytolowerinterestratestospurdemandandpromotegrowth.
XYZ’s interest rate is lowered from 1.0 percent to 0.75 percent, and the
differential has now grown to 3.5 percent (4.25 percent − 0.75 percent =
3.5percent).
Traders, encouraged by the growing interest rate differential, go long
ABCandsellshortXYZ,inordertocollecttheadditionalinterest.Ifenough
traderscanbeenticedtogolongABCandsellshortXYZ,thiswillcreate

they are not mutually exclusive. Traders who are long the ABC/XYZ pair

WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?
At this point, readers may be wondering why traders would be excited
about collecting an interest rate differential of 3.0 percent or 3.5 percent.
While the amount of interest may not seem significant at first glance, a
closer look will reveal the secret as to why hedge funds and institutions
favorthisstrategy.
Inreferencetoatradercollecting3.5percentinterestonthetrade,the
3.5percentisbasedonanonleveragedtransaction.Forinstance,ifatrader
islongonelotoftheU.S.dollar/Japaneseyen(USD/JPY)currencypair,he
or she is long approximately 100,000 U.S. dollars and short an equivalent
amountofJapaneseYen.
If we assume an interest rate differential of 3.5 percent, this means
thatoverthecourseofayear,thetraderwouldcollectapproximately3.5
percentof$100,000,orabout$3,500,ifheorsheislongthehigher-yielding
currency(USD).
Here’sthegoodpart:Duetothetremendousleverageaffordedbythe
forex market, traders do not have to put up 100 percent of the value of a
currency pair in order to control that investment. For example, a trader
usingleverageof50–1wouldneedtoinvestonly$2,000tocontrolonelot
ofacurrencypair,insteadofthefullamountof$100,000.
Thetraderisnotpenalizedforusingleverage,andcollectsthefull3.5
percent interest on the entire $100,000 ($3,500), even though the trader
onlyhadtoinvestafractionofthatamount($2,000).
Thiscreatesamuchhigherreturnoninvestment,andhelpstoexplain
the popularity of this technique. It is also important to note that leverage
isa“double-edgedsword,”whichcanleadtorapidlossesaswellasrapid
gains.
COLLECTING INTEREST
The advantage of this technique from the trader’s perspective is that he
or she might turn a profit regardless of whether the trade moves in the
desired direction. For example, if the trade remains flat for months, the
tradercouldstillcomeoutaheadaslongasheorshecollectsinterest.This

mid-2003.
With the interest rate differential between the U.S. dollar and the
Japanese yen at 1.0 percent, and the U.S. economy in a tailspin, traders
had little incentive to go long the currency pair. The USD/JPY exchange

The Federal Reserve’s prolonged low-interest-rate policy, combined
with tax cuts, gradually stimulated growth in the U.S. economy. By the

ENTERING THE TRADE
Let’s take a look at this concept in action. At 17:00 Eastern U.S. time, the
openingpriceonthefive-minuteEUR/USDchartis1.2583(seeFigure16.1).
We’llplaceasellorder15pipsabovetheopeningpriceat1.2598,andabuy
order15pipsbelowtheopenat1.2568.
If we do not have a trade execution within two hours, we will can-
cel both the buy and sell orders. At that point, the reason for placing
the trade is no longer valid, because the Asian markets are beginning
to stir, and volume and volatility are about to increase. When real vol-
ume enters the market, the moves are more likely to be real, so a strat-
egy that fades breakouts would be inappropriate under these circum-
stances.
After initially drifting higher, the exchange rate drops, and the buy
order is executed at 1.2568 (see Figure 16.2). Our stop is located 15 pips
below the entry point, at 1.2553. This is very important—we immediately
cancel the sell order at 1.2598. Our target will be a modest return to the
openingprice,or1.2583.
Withinafewhours,theexchangerateaimlesslydriftstowardtheexit
pointof1.2583,andthetradeiscompleted(seeFigure16.3).Thetraderhas
the option of exiting the entire position, or closing a portion of the trade
andmovingthestoptothebreakevenpoint.

of asking, “How much time will it take to double my account” (which

EVENING THE ODDS
Trading can be difficult, and in an effort to make it easier, some traders
resort to taking very quick exits. “It’s hard to earn 100 pips,” goes the
rationale, “I’ll just try to make 10 pips on each trade.” It seems to make
sense; surely, it is easier to earn 10 pips than it is to earn 50 or 100 pips.

If you’ve never played roulette, you might think the odds are 50–50.
Afterall,halfofthenumberedpocketsarered,andtheotherhalfareblack,
right?
Wrong. In addition to the red and black pockets, there is at least one
pocket that is neither red nor black. This “zero” pocket tilts the odds
slightlyagainstourplayer.
InEuropeanroulettethereisonlyonezeropocket,givingthehousea
slightadvantage.Onthistable,theoddsareabout53:47againstourplayer.
American roulette wheels have two 0s, zero and double zero, and this in-
creases the house advantage to about 5.3 percent. This further stacks the
oddsagainstourplayer,reducinghischancesforsuccess.
In the world of forex trading, the zero pockets represent the spread.
The odds are always going to be at least slightly in favor of the “house,”
which in this case is the market maker. The wider the spread, the more
“zero pockets” the trader must overcome. Just as each additional zero
pocket lowers the roulette player’s chances of success, every additional
pipinthespreadlessensthetrader’schancesofsuccess.

BUT THE OTHER TRADING INSTRUCTOR

No, but I know that many traders are seeking exactly that. In fact, some
prominent trading instructors are teaching their students to seek only a
small 10- or 15-pip gain before exiting the trade. What is their motivation
forteachingpeopletotradethisway?

If you place just a few trades, your trading coach collects just a little

Our trader just wants to gain 10 pips. That should be easy, right? It’s
understoodthatthetraderwilllosethespread(3pips)uponenteringthe

Nowthatweknowwhatisrequiredtocreateawinningtrade,let’ssee
what would have to happen to create an equivalent loss. This is how we

In order to generate a loss of 10 pips, the trader would only need an
adversemoveof7pips.Thisisbecausealossof3pipsisincurredimmedi-

We’vedeterminedthatourtraderneedsapositivemoveof13pipsto

loss of 10 pips. The “raw odds” of 10-pip win versus a 10-pip loss for this
tradecanbeexpressedas:
13/7=1.857:1
Theoddsofsuccessinthiscaseare1.857:1,ornearly2:1against.That’s
a real eye-opener, isn’t it? Now you know why it’s so difficult to make
money trading for small gains—the playing field is too small! This is the

We can certainly improve the odds of any trade by using good strate-

Let’sreviewtheearliertradingsituation,onlythistimewe’llmakethe

time the trader will be trying to gain 100 pips instead of just 10 pips. In
order to turn a profit of 100 pips, the trader actually needs the exchange
ratetomove103pipsinhisorherfavor:

Inordertogeneratealossof100pips,thetraderwouldonlyneedan

WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE “SMART
MONEY”
Think about the way so-called “smart money” approaches trading in this
market.Dohedgefundsandinstitutionaltraderschaseafter10-or15-pip
gains?Ofcoursenot—theyunderstandthedynamicsthatareatworkhere.
Not only are they not interested in 10-pip gains, they’re not chasing after
100-pipgainseither.Manyofthese“bigfish”areonlysatisfiedwithgainsof

aspossible.
Not only do the institutional traders understand the value of playing
on a larger field, they set up their trades so that they can collect interest
to boot—thereby increasing their odds to better than 50–50! If this were
a casino, they’d be tossed out immediately. Now you know why they are
calledthe“smartmoney”!

To bolster my point, I opened a demo account and proceeded to place
tradesusinga“strategy”ofholdingontolossesuntilthetradeturnedpos-

I placed a total of 20 trades, with 19 “winners” and 1 loss, resulting
in a success rate of 95 percent. One might think that a success rate of 95
percentwouldcertainlyleadtoaniceprofit,butasyoucansee,thisisnot

Becausethistraderwastooquicktotakeprofitsandtoowillingtohold

BEWARE THE BACK TESTER
There is nothing wrong with back testing a strategy per se; in fact, back
testing can be a valuable tool in strategy development when it is used
properly. However, some unscrupulous operators have appropriated this
strategy development tool and turned it into a weapon for use against an
unsuspectingtradingpublic.
Back testing is the process of optimizing a trading strategy using his-
toricaldata.Tradersbackteststrategiestodeterminehowwelltheyhave
workedinthepast,withtheassumptionthatwhathasworkedinthepast
willcontinuetoworkinthefuture.
Since markets are not static, and are constantly evolving and chang-
ing, back testing is not a panacea. The past does not equal the future. As
marketschange,goodtradersadapt,andthebesttradersaretheoneswho
adaptquickly.
Because we know what has occurred in the past, it is easy to create
strategies that would have been highly successful in the past. Since we
can’tturnbacktheclockandtradeinthepast,thesestrategiesarelimited
in their usefulness. This hasn’t stopped some individuals from marketing
these overoptimized, back-tested strategies as current and viable money-
makingopportunities.
One individual allegedly solicited funds from unsuspecting investors
by misrepresenting back tested returns as actual returns. This person is
currently the subject of a Commodity Futures Trading Commission com-
plaint, for allegedly having “engaged in the fraudulent solicitation of cus-
tomersbymisrepresentinghispastperformance.”
HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING

A Tale of
Two Traders
I’vebeenfortunateenoughtotradenotonlyformyself,butalsoforsev-
eral hedge funds. Working withhedge funds is terrific—they writebig
checks and then they leave you alone. Trading for individuals is hard
work—theywritesmallchecksandtheyneverleaveyoualone.Ifyouwant
totradeforothers,institutionalmoneyisthewaytogo.
There is a lot of institutional money out there, looking for a home.
Hedge funds have expanded tremendously in the past few years, with as-
sets under management skyrocketing from about $500 billion in the year
2000toover$1.5trillionin2006.Thesefigureswilllikelycontinuetogrow
in the future. The upshot of this is that some hedge funds literally have
more money to invest than they can reasonably handle, and they might
“farmout”someoftheseassetstoindividualslikeyouandme.
If you can establish a reasonable track record, you might be able to
convince a hedge fund to allow you to trade some of their funds. What
constitutes a good track record? The answer may be different from what
youbelieve.
INDIVIDUALS VERSUS INSTITUTIONS
If you want to trade for individuals, you’ll often be asked, “How much
money will you make for me?” This is indicative of how most individual
tradersthink;theyaremoreconcernedaboutrewardthantheyareabout

temptedtocovertheimportanttechnicalaspectsoftradingfromthe
forexpointofview,intermsofpracticalstrategiesandtradingmethodolo-
gies. At this time, I’d like to touch upon some important points that you
mayfindusefulinyourtrading.
A GOOD TRADE IS NOT THE SAME THING AS
A WINNING TRADE
Alwaysrememberthat,intrading,theendsdonotjustifythemeans.Orto
bemoreprecise,theoutcomeofyourtradedoesnotnecessarilyjustifythe
methodusedtoachievethatoutcome.Sometraderstaketheattitudethat
aslongasthetradeisawinner,thereisjustificationnomatterwhatrules
werebrokenalongtheway.
But the fact is that a winning trade is not always a good trade, and
a good trade is not always a winning trade. It’s possible to do everything
wrong and still achieve a winning result on a particular trade, just as it’s
possibletodoeverythingcorrectlyandstillloseonanygiventrade.
Wouldyouratherbeagoodtraderoraluckytrader?Strivetobeagood
trader,becauseanyonecanbealuckytrader—forawhile.Don’tjudgeyour
trading on any particular result, but on whether you are following proper
procedure. Did you follow a predetermined plan? Did you place the stop
correctlyandsensibly?Doyouhaveanexitstrategy?

If you are doing all of these things correctly, and still are not trading
successfully, at least you will then be able to determine that the problem
liesnotwithyourexecutionbutwiththeplan.Planscanbemodified.
PROPER EXECUTION IS CRITICAL
If the problem lies with us—if we always get out too soon, or if we trade
withoutstops,orifwejustenterandexitonawhim–thenwe’lleventually
fail,eventhoughtheoriginalplanitselfmaynotbeatfault.Agoodplanis
uselessifit’sbeingexecutedimproperly.
Thisiswheresomanytradersgowrong.Theywanttosucceedsothey
createaplan;thentheyrandomlychangetheplanbecausetheydon’thave
the discipline to follow it. Then when they fail, they blame the plan. The
faultisnotwiththeplanbutintheirfailuretoexecuteproperly.
Suchatradermovesfromonetechniquetothenext(becausethetech-
niques“don’twork”)wheninrealitytheyhavenowayofknowingiftheir
plan works. When you successfully follow your plan properly, do every-
thingthatyoucantoreinforcethatbehavior,regardlessoftheoutcomeof
anyparticulartrade.
Theoutcomeofanysingletradeisnotwithintherealmofyourcontrol,
butyoucancontrolyourabilitytofollowaplan.Soweconcernourselves
withthethingsthatwecancontrol(planningandexecution)andworryless
aboutthingsthatarebeyondourcontrol(theresultofanygivenindividual

Conversely,nevercongratulateyourselffora“winning”tradeoutcome
that comes as a result of ignoring your plan or trading without a plan. In-
stead,consideryourselfluckyandrealizethatinthelongrun,youwillnot
succeed in this manner. Remember, if you consistently break the rules,
eventuallytheruleswillbreakyou.
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS

poortradingrecordsareduetomanipulationonthepartofmarketmakers
orinstitutionsorsomeotheroutsideinfluence.Theywilltellyouthattheir

situation. Individuals who fail to take responsibility for their own trades
willneversucceedinanytradingenvironment.
KEEP IT SIMPLE
As mentioned earlier, many traders who fail to follow a plan often dis-
card that plan because they feel it “doesn’t work,” and then move on to
another plan. One thing that I’ve noticed, especially among highly intelli-
gent traders, is that they feel that a plan must be complicated in order to
succeed.
Theybecomedrawnintoaworldofincreasinglyobscureandcompli-
catedtechniques,usesuper-secretindicators,andkeepburrowingdeeper
into the fringes as if searching for some secret that has eluded them. The
morecomplicatedtheplanis,thebetteritmustbe,right?
Ofcourse,thisisnotthecase.Cancomplicatedtechniqueswork?Ab-
solutely!Butsimpletechniquescanworkjustaswell,iftheyareexecuted
properly.
Thinkofatradingstrategyasifitwereamachine;ifithasfewermov-
ingparts,thentherearefewerpartsthatcanbreak,andfewerthingsthat
cangowrongwithit.
Itisalwaysafunintellectualexercisetolearnaboutvariousandcom-
plextradingmethods,butthisdoesnotmeanthatsimplemethodscannot
work. If you have faced difficulty while using simple methods, there is a
good chance that either the plan was not a good one or the plan was not
properlyexecuted.
PHYSICAL VERSUS MENTAL
I don’t think that any overview of trading would be complete without
touching on the subjects of physical fitness and mental attitude. In this
profession, it’s easy to wear down physically and mentally, especially
when dealing with a 24-hour market. It’s really important to get some

exercisewheneverpossible,becausethephysicalstimulationcanactually
increase your mental sharpness and improve your decision-making capa-
bilities.
Try to get to the gym or at least get some kind of exercise every day;
you’ll feel better, and chances are you’ll trade better, too. It’s not healthy
tositatacomputeralldayeveryday,sobesuretoplananintradaybreak
fromtrading.
There are plenty of books and materials available that are designed
toimprovementalattitudes,andyoushouldapproachthesewithanopen
mind. I was surprised to learn that many successful traders enjoy these
types of materials. It’s been my experience that the beliefs of the reader
willgreatlyimpacttheresults,orlackthereof,ofthestudyofthematerials.
What I mean by that is if you think that reading these types of books
will have a positive impact on your trading, you are correct, and if you
believe they will not, you are also correct. This is why it is necessary to
have anopen mindwhen studying these subjects. I’vealways favored the
worksofNapoleonHill,andtherearemanyotherauthorsofthistype.
Remember, if you allow yourself to get too tired and to wear down,
yourbodywillrebelagainstthisbehavior.Psychologistsbelievethatindi-
vidualswhoworktoohardoftensubconsciouslysabotagetheirownwork,
inordertogetawayfromtheworkandbacktoasenseofnormalcy.
Thisoccurstotradersallthetime,intheformofatradingerror.Ifyou
find yourself sitting at your computer for 16 hours a day, placing endless
trades, be sure to remind yourself of why you began trading in the first
place. I’m certain that the idea was to improve your quality of life, not to
diminishit.It’slikemyfathersays,“Don’tforgettoenjoyyourlife!”
