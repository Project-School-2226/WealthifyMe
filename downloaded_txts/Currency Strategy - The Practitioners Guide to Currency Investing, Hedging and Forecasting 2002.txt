the subsequent year and “Black Wednesday”, September 16, 1992, when the UK currency
was forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and promptly collapsed in value.
The abiding memory of mine to this day is of the sheer power of the currency market in
its ability to “defeat” the might and resolve of such a respected central bank as the Bank of
England, which gave everything it had in its effort to defend sterling’s ERM “floor” against
theDeutschmarkof2.7778.Itisamemoryofcurrencydealersscreamingdownthephone,of
wave after wave of official intervention to support sterling being swatted aside by the sheer
weightofsellingpressure.Thelessonofthisneitherisnorshouldbethatfinancialmarketswill

beresistedforanylengthoftime.Inthecaseof“BlackWednesday”—or“WhiteWednesday”
asmanywouldhaveitsubsequently—theUKeconomywasexperiencingasevererecession
andthussimplycouldnottoleratetheraisingofUKinterestratesneededtosupportsterling
and keep it within its ERM band commitment. The economic pain of this interest rate and
exchangeratecommitmentwascompletelyatoddswiththeeconomicrealityintheUKatthat
time. Moreover, UK foreign exchange reserves were fast being wiped out in that defensive
effort. In 1992, the global currency market’s daily turnover was the equivalent of USD880
billion,accordingtotheBankofInternationalSettlements(BIS)tri-annualsurvey.Thus,the
BankofEngland’sabilitytointervenetosupportsterling,albeitinthebillions,wasdwarfed
bythesizeoftheforcesopposingit.Asofthe1998BISsurvey,dailyturnoverhadincreased
tosomeUSD1.5trillion,subsequentlyfallingbacktoUSD1.2trillioninthe2001surveyin
thewakeofthecreationoftheEuro.
Needlesstosay,theBankofEnglandhascertainlynotbeenaloneinitsinabilitytodefeat
the power of the currency market. The following year, the remaining members of the ERM
wereforcedundertrulyextraordinarypressuretoabandonthenarrow2.25%bandsrequired
by the ERM commitment, widening them to 15%. On one day alone, on that Friday, July
30, before the weekend move to capitulate and widen the ERM bands, tens of billions of
dollar equivalent were expended in an ultimately futile attempt to support member curren-
cies. Depending on your point of view, even the feared German central bank, the Deutsche
Bundesbankhadbeendefeated(thoughthescepticalmaintainthatitsefforttosavetheERM
was at best half-hearted). Whatever the case, it was an important lesson; not least that the
currency market can act with unparalleled force and ferocity if it is so impelled. There was
ofcoursetheobviousquestion—whyandhowcouldsuchextraordinaryeventshappeninthe
currencymarket,eventsthatwerecertainlynotpredictedbyeconomistsandwhichsometimes

capableofbeingpredicted.Ithaslongbeenmyviewthatsucharesponsewasinadequateand
thatinordertostudycurrencymarketsonemightthereforehavetoincludeotherdisciplines,
albeit within a single analytical framework. Indeed, where economics has for the most part
failed to predict such short-term moves, other disciplines such as technical and capital flow
analysishavesucceeded.Granted,theirsuccessisnotperfect,butithasbeenmeasurablybetter.
Furthermore,whileithastobestressedthatsuchlong-termvaluationmodelsareimportant
and useful guides to long-term trends, they are flawed as forecasting tools because the very
concept of “equilibrium” is itself flawed. Such a concept is a useful and logical construct,
providingaframeworkaroundwhicheconomicanalysiscanbebuiltandallowingonetofocus
on a final outcome. The specifics of that final outcome are likely to remain vague however.
Whileanequilibriummodelmaybeabletotellwhatthefinaloutcomeislikelytobe,itwillnot

which might change or distort that outcome. Moreover, while the construct of equilibrium

are temporarily divergent from it, will revert back. In other words, it relates to an ultimate
destination, or a “final outcome” as described above. Markets however are volatile and can
fluctuate widely. Yet markets are an expression of economic reality, which means that the
economicrealityitselffluctuates.Inturn,thismeansthattheequilibriumlevelresultingfrom

specifically the subject of this book, the currency market. Firstly, classical economic theory
asserts that market practitioners are “objective”, that is they are completely independent of
andarenotaffectedbythemarketconditionsinwhichtheyoperate.Intuitively,weknowthis
tobenonsense.Aninvestorisnotonlydirectlyaffectedbypresentmarketconditionssuchas
liquidityandvolatilitybutalsobypastexperience.Pastsuccessesmaymakeourinvestorbolder
intheirfutureinvestmentdecisions,whilepastlossesmaymakethemmuchmorecautious.As

whocanbothbeaffectedbyandcanaffectmarketconditions.Inshort,theyarebothcauseand

Heretoo,thereisno“objectivity”.Eachisaffectedbytheother—andweknowthisbecause
ifitwerenotthecasepricetrendscouldnothappen.Iftheywerecompletelyindependentof
eachother,supplywouldinstantlymatchdemandandviceversa,thusstoppingapricetrend
beforeithadbegun.Yet,thisisnotthecase.Pricetrendsacrossassetandcurrencymarkets
canlastfordays,weeks,monthsorevenyears.
Anotherwidelyheldmythisthatmarketsareperfectly“efficient”.Thesuggestionhereis
that both information availability and distribution are perfect—that all market participants
have equal access to available, market-moving information. Furthermore, the assumption of
marketefficiencyisthatallmarketparticipantsare“rational”andareprofit-seeking.Likethe
suggestionof“objectivity”,thisisalsothestuffofnonsense.Informationiswidelyandfreely
available,butneitheritsavailabilitynoritsdistributionisperfect.Indeed,onecouldarguethat
theverypurposeofcurrencymarketpractitionersistogetinformationthatothersdonothave.
Equally, the very concept of being “rational” is a subjective one and open to interpretation.
Further, currency dealers are “rational” to the extent that they are trying to make a profit.
However,cautiousinvestorsorcorporateTreasurerswhoareseekingtomanagetheircurrency
risk are not trying to make a profit. Rather, they are trying to limit any possible loss from

within the currency market, are also not for the most part profit-seeking. Trying to impose
an all-fits-one approach to explaining exchange rates simply does not work. For this very
reason,economicsbyitselfhashadmixedresultsatbestinforecastingexchangerates.The
dynamicsofthecurrencymarketaredifferentfromothermarketsandthisshouldbetakeninto

As we have seen, equilibrium exchange rate models help to provide the framework and
thedirectionforlong-termexchangerateanalysis,buttheyareforthemostpartincapableof
being more specific or more accurate over a shorter time frame. In trying to forecast short-
term exchange rate moves, it may be necessary to use other tools and even other analytical
disciplines. Within this book, there are outside of economics four types of analysis that we
willlookatforthispurpose:flow,technical,riskappetiteandmarketpsychology.Depending
on what kind of currency market practitioner you are, you may view one or more of these
analyticaldisciplineswithsomescepticism.Thisisalltothegood,forifsomeoneistouseany
formofanalysisintheirdailybusinesstheyfirsthavetobeconvincedthatitactuallyworks.
We will examine these types of analysis in detail in the first four chapters of this book. For
instance,marketpsychologymaybethoughtofasanexcessivelyvagueconceptincapableof

The subject of technical analysis also draws mixed reactions. While widely followed by
currency dealers and the leveraged fund community, many corporate officers and investors
appeartoregarditwithscepticism—andmanyeconomistslookonitassomeformofvoodoo
orwitchcraft.Yettechnicalanalysisor“charting”hasastrongfollowingnotforanyideological

of technical analysis is in predicting the timing of currency moves. In particular, it can be

That experiment began more precisely on August 15, 1971 when US President Richard
Nixon announced that the US was abandoning its convertibility commitment between the
valueoftheUSdollarandgoldattherateofUSD35perounceofgold.Adiplomaticband-
aidwassubsequentlyattemptedinDecember1971intheformoftheso-called“Smithsonian
Agreement”, but the attempt to keep major exchange rates pegged and shackled finally col-
lapsed in March 1973. As with the ERM crises of 1992 and 1993, the cost of defending a
currency peg that was incapable of responding to economic changes was eventually viewed
as intolerable. The 1971–1973 period was unquestionably the seminal turning point in the
development of the currency markets. Subsequently, there were historical events of varying
importance,notleastthedevelopmentoftheEuropeanMonetarySystemorthe“Snake”which
wassucceededbytheERM,thevariousoilcrises,thePlazaandLouvreAccordsof1985and

weaknessfrom1995onwards.Noneofthesehowevercarriedthesameweightasthatofthe
second most important event in the recent life of the currency markets, the break-up of the
Soviet Union and the ending of the Cold War. The coming to power in the Soviet Union of
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 was a momentous event, the effects of which are arguably still
being felt to this day. Glasnost and perestroika were primarily viewed as political doctrines
of change, but they also reflected significant economic change and not just for the Soviet
Union.

encouraging US consumers to buy more European goods. For US exporters, however, the
picture was the opposite, as their exports to Europe became less competitive as the dollar
strengthened,reducingtheirmarketshareorpricingthemoutofsomemarketsentirely.Thus,
theUStradedeficitballooned,notjustwithEuropebutwiththeworldasawhole,reaching
a level of some USD400 billion in 2001. Yet, just as the US trade deficit was expanding,
so more competitive exports to the US together with a slowdown in US demand in 2001
forcedUSmanufacturersinturntocuttheirprices,reducinginflationarypressures.However,
as corporate executives are painfully aware, just as domestic currency weakness can lead to

Exporters are of necessity keenly aware of the importance of exchange rate movements.
However,companiesthathavenoexportsbutsimplyproduceandsellinasinglecountryare
also affected. A company that has no direct export exposure and thus thinks itself blissfully
exempt from currency risk is in for a nasty shock. As we have seen in the above example,

Currencymovementscanalsohaveaprofoundeffectoninvesting.Fixedincomeandequity
portfolio managers, in investing in another country’s assets, automatically take on currency
exposure to that country. Frequently, fund managers view the initial decision to invest in a
countryasbeingoneandthesamewithinvestinginthatcountry’scurrency.Thisisnotnec-
essarily the case for the simple reason that the dynamics which operate within the currency
market are frequently not the same as those that govern asset markets. It is entirely possi-
ble for a country’s fixed income and equity markets to perform strongly over time, while
simultaneouslyitscurrencydepreciates.Myfavouriteexampleofthisphenomenonisthatof
South Africa. From the autumn of 1998, when the 5-year South African government bond
yield briefly exceeded 21%, this was one of the world’s most outstanding investments un-
til November 2001. By then, this yield had made a low of around 9.25%, a direct and in-
versereflectionofthedegreetowhichitspricesoaredoverthepreviousthreeyears.Inthat

investor in the 5-year South African government bond in the autumn of 1998 would have
seen their excellent gains in the underlying fixed income position over that time wiped out
by the losses on the rand exposure. The lesson from this is that currency risk should be an
importantconsiderationforassetmanagersandmoreoveronethatismanagedseparatelyand
independently from the underlying. Empirical studies have shown that currency volatility
reflects between 70 and 90% of a fixed income portfolio’s total return. Thus, for the more

risk. Before looking at currency hedging strategies and structures, we first have to establish
what kinds of currency risks exist. For the multinational corporation, there are three types
ofcurrencyriskorexposure:transaction,translationandeconomic,eachofwhichrequiresa

risk but even by doing so it is taking an active decision. There is no opt-out with regards to

gone to great effort to establish sophisticated Treasury operations. There are still some who
hold out, and in any case even for these “progressives” there remains work to be done in

Theworldsofthecorporationandtheinvestormayseemverydifferentonthefaceofit,but
in fact they are very similar in a number of ways. Both view currency risk as an annoyance
and indeed there remain some on both sides who refuse to acknowledge it exists. Still to
thisday,Icomeupagainstinvestorswhohaveanalmostideologicalaversiontotheideaof

However, a higher domestic cost base means of necessity that a manufacturer of whatever

keepsexportpriceslowerthandomesticones.
Thehighercostbaseandconsumerpricetoleranceworkhandinhand.IntheUS,becauseUS

downretailprices,reducingconsumer“pricetolerance”.PPPtheorystatesthattheexchange
rateshouldadjustforpricedifferentialsinthesamegood.Thus,thecurrencywherethegood
is priced cheaper should appreciate relative to that where it is priced more expensively. In
this case, the US dollar should appreciate relative to the yen. Assuming that trade in autos
can affect exchange rates over a sustained period of time, this is what should take place in
the exchange rate as a result of the relationship between PPP and a potential price disparity
betweenJapaneseautossoldintheUSandJapan.
Inreality,thisisofcoursenotwhathappened,confirmationifsuchwereneededthatPPP
can be distorted by “temporary” factors. Between 1993 and 1995, the dollar–yen exchange

AsJapanesedomesticpricesaresubstantiallyhigherthanthosetoleratedintheUS,suchan
appreciation in the yen’s value would merely compound an existing problem. Our Japanese
manufacturer would face the dilemma of either maintaining the Japanese domestic price in
theUSandthuslosingmarketshare—andpleasingtheUStradenegotiator—orcuttingthe
USdollarpricesharply,sacrificingitsmarginonthealtersofsalesandmarketshare.
In the first case, one would assume US consumers would not tolerate Japanese domestic

this did not end the issue because the newly US-made auto would still be cheaper than its

Thus, care needs to be taken with PPP as it can be distorted by a wide variety of factors,
particularlyovertheshortterm.Overthelongrun,however,PPPservesasanextremelyuseful
benchmark.Indeed,anotherexampleshouldhopefullyputthePPPmodelinabetterlight.

For instance, when the Euro came into being in January 1999, most currency forecasters
predictedtheEuro–dollarexchangeratewouldappreciateovertime—thatis,theEurowould
appreciate against the dollar—based on anticipation of capital flows and the view that the
newsinglecurrencywasundervalued.Thefactthatmostcurrencyforecastersinturngotthis
prediction entirely wrong shows the danger and the limitation of valuation considerations.
You can be looking at the wrong measure of valuation, and even if you are looking at the
right one you can get the wrong time horizon. To be fair to my fellow currency forecasters
in the industry, the Euro–dollar exchange rate did rise initially, reaching a high of 1.1885.
From then, however, it fell like a stone, grinding lower remorselessly, greatly disappointing
notonlytheexpectationsofthemarket,butalsothoseofEuropeanUnionofficials.Onemust
givecreditwhereit’sdue,however.Inearly1999,noteveryonewasaragingbullontheEuro.
OnJanuary7ofthatyear,TheEconomistpublishedthelatestreadingsofitsBigMacIndex,

price of a Big Mac into US dollars at the prevailing exchange rate and divide that by the
US dollar price of a Big Mac in the US. Clearly, if you had followed that forecast and run
your position over the next two years, you could have made a lot of money. The usefulness
ofPPPappliesnotjustwithindustrialcountrycurrenciesbutalsowiththoseoftheemerging

Inordertogiveaslightlymoreup-to-dateeditionofthisentertaining—andinformative—

asofApril19,2001.Atthetime,theseresultswouldhavesuggestedanumberofinteresting

have yet to show such accuracy. Within the industrialized world, these results suggested at
the time that the Euro was still undervalued by around 11% as of mid-April 2001, estimat-
ing the PPP level for the Euro–dollar exchange rate at 0.99. In addition, it suggested that
the Japanese yen was around 6% undervalued against the dollar, implying a PPP rate for
dollar–yenofaround116.Subsequently,itshouldindeedberememberedthatsincethenthe

[[Table not available in this electronic edition.]]
Euro–dollar exchange rate has indeed appreciated from 0.88 through 1.00. Meanwhile, the
dollar–yen exchange rate fell from 124 to 116. Readers will no doubt claim that a plethora
of factors could have been at work, irrespective of goods’ price differentials and undoubt-
edly that was the case. That said, there is no getting away from the fact that the Big Mac
Index in this case showed the way in terms of the forthcoming trend for these exchange
rates.
As with every model, there are also cases where it has not worked so well and there are
indeed cases of that in Table 1.1 (e.g. the South African rand was undervalued by 53%). In
response, I would say that broadly speaking any type of PPP model should only be viewed

Whentherealexchangerateisconstant,theinternationalpricecompetitivenessofacountry’s

Equally,ifthereisanexcesssupplyoflocalcurrencywithinafixedexchangerateregime,

ited by the extent of its foreign exchange reserves and its willingness to tolerate sharply
higher interest rates. When a central bank runs out of reserves in its attempt to offset ex-
cess local currency supply, de-pegging and flotation (devaluation) become inevitable. The
general rule for this is that the longer the central bank tries to defend a fixed exchange
rate regime that is experiencing an excess supply of local currency, the greater the degree
of local currency devaluation and “overshooting” relative to that equilibrium once it is de-
pegged and floated. This is one of the reasons why emerging market currencies such as the
Indonesian rupiah, Thai baht, Korean won, Russian rouble and Brazilian real substantially
overshot any approximation of their equilibrium level using a monetary approach before
finally recovering some ground. Thus, while the Monetary Approach may not be able to
make accurate short-term exchange rate forecasts, it should be able to provide insight into
futureexchangerate“events”,suchasthede-pegginganddevaluationofafixedexchangerate

cruciallyimportant.
In an economy with high capital mobility, suppose that a central bank decides to loosen
monetarypolicybycuttinginterestrates.Onemustassumethatitdoesthisbecauseofweak
growth conditions and benign inflation. As we saw before when looking at money demand,

basisincreasingtheincentivetoholdmoneyorcash.Thisincreaseinmoneydemandcanbe
puttoworkbuyinggoodsandshouldreflectafutureriseinnationalincomeandgrowth.The
standard monetary model thinks of this in terms of rising demand causing price increases,
which in turn causes the exchange rate to depreciate via the concept of PPP. Looking at it
another way, rising domestic demand will cause rising import demand, which should mean
deterioration in the trade balance. This in turn should eventually lead to depreciation in the
exchangeratetoallowthetradebalancetorevertbacktowardsanequilibriumlevel.Another
wayofexpressingthesamethingisthatlowerinterestratescausecapitaloutflows,whichin
turncausedepreciationintheexchangerate.Conversely,thebasicassumptionisthattighter
monetarypolicythroughhigherinterestratesshouldleadeithertoweakerdomesticdemand
and a positive swing in the trade balance, or capital inflows, both of which should cause
exchangerateappreciation.
On the fiscal side, much depends on whether trade or capital flows dominate. On the one
hand, looser fiscal policy, either through tax cuts or spending increases, should cause rising
domesticdemand,whichinturnshouldcausedeteriorationinthetradebalance.Ontheother
hand, looser fiscal policy causes higher domestic interest rates, which in turn attract capital
inflows.Iftradeflowsdominate,thentheexchangerateshoulddepreciate.However,ifcapital

Conversely, tighter fiscal policy should, according to Mundell–Fleming, lead to weaker
domesticdemand.Onthetradeflowside,thisshouldresultinreducedimportdemand,causing

1.3 THEINTERESTRATEAPPROACH
Afurtherapproachtotryingtodetermineorpredictexchangeratesisthatinvolvingtheanalysis
ofinterestratedifferentials(theInterestRateApproach).Thisinvolvesanumberofdifferent
principles and we shall go through them briefly and in turn. The first principle involves the
basicinterestrateparitytheory,whichisthat:
Anexchangerate’sforward%premium/discount=itsinterestratedifferential

Thus, for instance, the traditional forward discount on the dollar–yen exchange rate should
equaltheinterestratedifferentialbetweenthetwocurrencies.Thisisseenastheequilibrium

coveredinterestratearbitrage.
Thetheoryofinterestrateparityisaguidingprincipleforseveraleconomicandfinancial
models.Underthistheory,itisassumedthattheexpected(interestrate)returnsofacurrency

exchangerates.
Indeed, before we go further into the theory, it is important to point out a practical flaw
in the theory involving incentive, which is undoubtedly a key contributing factor to its poor
predictive track record—the theory supposes an automatically causal relationship between
interestratesandtheexchangerate,yetinpracticemostcurrencymarketpractitionerstrade

Returningtothetheoryfornow,interestrateparitytheorystatesthatthedifferencebetween

can,thankstotheseminalworkoftheeconomistIrvingFisher.Thus,accordingtowhathas
becomeknownasthe“Fishereffect:”
Thedifferenceininterestrates=thedifferenceinexpectedinflationrates
Thus, we have gone from the difference between the spot and the forward exchange rate
equatingtotheinterestratedifferentialthroughtheinterestrateparitytheory,whichinturn
equates to the difference in expected inflation rates through the Fisher effect. Yet, PPP tells
usthatabsoluteorrelativepricegrowthlevelscanbeusedtoforecastfutureexchangerates.

FundamentalAnalysis 33
Thus,throughPPPwecanextrapolatethisonestagefurthertosuggestthat:
Thedifferenceinexpectedinflationrates=theexpectedexchangeratechange
Bringingallthesetogether,weget:
(1)Thedifferenceinspotandforwardrates=thedifferenceininterestrates
(Interestrateparitytheory)
(2)Thedifferenceininterestrates=thedifferenceinexpectedinflationrates
(Fishereffect)
(3)Thedifferenceinexpectedinflationrates=theexpectedchangeinspotexchangerate
(PurchasingPowerParity)
Logicallyfromthis,onemayconcludethatthedifferencebetweenthespotandforwardrates

knownastheexpectationstheoryofexchangerates.
Finally,thereisthetheorythat:
(4)Thedifferenceininterestrates=theexpectedchangeinthespotexchangerate
(InternationalFishereffect)
On the face of it, the ideas presented above seem logical and follow a clear and persuasive
train of thought. There is only one small problem—this clear train of thought rarely works
in practice. More specifically, the difference in interest rates or expected inflation rates may
beequaltothetheoreticalconstructofthe“expectedchangeinthespotexchangerate”,but
in practice it is of the future exchange rate. In line with this, the forward rate is also a very
poorpredictorofthefutureexchangerate,afactthateconomistshavelabelled“forwardrate
bias”orthe“forwardpremiumpuzzle”.AsBansalandDahlquist(2000)2 confirmedintheir
exhaustive study, in contrast to the theory, empirical evidence suggests that in fact current
interestratedifferentialsandfuturespotexchangeratesarefrequentlynegativelycorrelated.
Thisisparticularlythecasewithinthedevelopedeconomies,thoughthepictureissomewhat

However,theunderlyingthemeisthatfrequentlycountriessimplyhavenotbeenpreparedto
maintain the degree of economic discipline that is required to maintain the fixed exchange

failure.

1.4.3 TheExternalBalanceandtheRealExchangeRate
Similar to the Balance of Payments Approach to exchange rates is that which focuses on
the relationship between a long-term equilibrium value for the real exchange rate and the
externalbalance.Underthis,thelong-termequilibriumexchangerateisthatwhichgenerates
bothinternalandexternalbalance,whereinternalbalanceisdefinedasfullemploymentand
external balance as the current account. Since the creation of this model, the emphasis has
shifted away from focusing on full employment to concentrating on achieving a sustainable
current account balance—not necessarily zero—which will achieve a perceived economic
andexchangerateequilibrium.
AswiththeBalanceofPaymentsApproach,thecurrentaccountisseenasthetransmission
mechanismfortheexchangerate,albeitthistimeunderbothfixedandfloatingexchangerate
regimes. If the current account balance is showing an unsustainably high deficit relative to
historicdeficitlevels,thiswillrequirearealexchangeratedepreciationtorestoreequilibrium.
Conversely,ifitisshowingaveryhighcurrentaccountsurplus,thiswillrequirearealexchange
rateappreciationtorestoreequilibrium.
TheexamplethatisoftenusedwithregardtothisisJapan,whichhashadastructurallyhigh
currentaccountsurplus.Usingtheexternalbalanceapproach,ifthatcurrentaccountsurplus
is seen as unsustainably high relative to historical norms, it requires a rise in the yen’s real
exchangeratetorestoreequilibrium.Barringperiodicreversals,thisiswhatwesawfrom1971
to 1995. Since then, the yen has reversed course, not least because the strengthening of the

for diagnosing over- or undervaluation and a consequent need for an adjustment to restore
equilibrium—butwhatitcannotdoistellyouwhenthatwillhappen.
Anotherwaytoestimatearealexchangerate’sequilibriumisFEER,orFundamentalEqui-
librium Exchange Rate, pioneered by the writer and economic scholar John Williamson in
1985. Recognizing the imperfections of the PPP concept, FEER reflects the exchange rate
value that is the result of a current account surplus or deficit that is in turn appropriate to
thelong-termstructuralcapitalinfloworoutflowintheeconomy,assumingthatthecountry
does not have barriers to free trade and is also trying to pursue internal balance. Assessing
theappropriateleveloflong-termstructuralcapitalinfloworoutflowrequiresaconsiderable
degreeofvaluejudgement.Evenifitdidnot,itassumesthatsuchcapitalinflowsoroutflows
should persist simply because they have occurred in the past. Given this construction, it is
notsurprisingthatestimatesofanexchangerate’sFEERvaluevarywidely.Thisisnottosay
that it is not a useful model. Indeed, models based on the FEER concept have been widely
used within the private sector for some time. However, it is to say that using such a type of
exchange rate model puts a considerable degree of emphasis on the value judgement of the
analystconcerned,therebyunderminingthepointofusingamodelinthefirstplace.
Lookingatexchangeratemodelsingeneralthatusesomevariationoftheexternalbalance

ratemodels,thosewhichfocusontheexternalbalanceshouldbeusedforlong-termexchange
rateconsiderationsratherthanfortheshortterm.
1.4.5 TermsofTrade
Another important aspect of the external balance approach to exchange rate determination
is the so-called “terms of trade”, which is the relationship between a country’s export and
import prices. A country’s terms of trade can be an important determinant of its long-term
equilibriumrealexchangerate.Wefindthisparticularlythecaseforcountriesthataremajor
commodity exporters and therefore whose economies are particularly sensitive to swings in
commodity prices. An improvement in a country’s terms of trade, that is a rise in its export
pricesrelativetoimportprices,shouldleadtoariseintherealexchangerateequilibriumvalue.
Rising export prices should be reflective of rising global demand for that country’s exports,
bothonanabsolutebasisandrelativetodomesticdemandlevels.Consequently,oneshould
assumethatanimprovementinthetermsoftradeshouldleadtoanimprovementinthecurrent
accountbalance,whichinturnrequiresarealexchangerateappreciationtorestoreequilibrium.
Equally, a deterioration in the terms of trade leads to a current account deterioration, which
requires a real exchange rate depreciation to restore equilibrium. For the sake of clarity, we

1.4.6 Productivity

The issue of productivity growth was much in debate in 2001 as economists sought to
explain the US dollar’s inexorable rise against the Euro. Indeed, both the Federal Reserve
BankofNewYorkandtheBankofEnglandproducedreportsontheissueofwhetherhigher
US productivity growth explained the US dollar’s strength and indeed whether or not the
US did in fact produce higher productivity growth. Despite the presence of such eminent
scholarship, the jury is still out. There does however seem to be greater clarity at least as
regardsthebroaderissueofwhetherornotproductivitygrowthshouldproduceexchangerate
appreciation.JustasPPPisnotagoodshort-termpredictorofexchangerates,soproductivity
growthshouldnotbeusedasashort-termtradingmodel.However,bothareprofoundlyuseful
inpredictingmedium-tolong-termexchangeratetrends.Here,thefactthattheUShashad

rium”supplylevelsrelativetodemand.Yet,weknowfrompainfulexperiencethatthisisnot
whathappens.Ifweviewproductivityassupplyandwagesasdemand,thestandardeconomic
model suggests that higher productivity growth automatically results in higher wages. Yet,
duringperiodsofmajortechnologicalchange,whichtendtoproducethestrongestlevelsof
productivity growth, the fact that competition is greatly increased produces such downward
pressuretopricestotheextentthattheonlywaysomecancompeteistocutwagegrowth.At
theveryleast,wagegrowthdoesnotkeepupwithproductivitygrowth.Inotherwords,demand
doesnotkeepupwithsupply—whichbringsusbacktotheideathatthisexcesssupplywill
ratherquicklyhavetocorrectautomaticallytomatchthelevelofdemand.
However, this is not what happens in reality because this simple model of productivity
(supply)growthandwage(demand)growthdoesnottakeaccountoftheverymodernconcept
of debt. Inadequate demand growth in the form of wages can be artificially propped up to
meet ever increasing supply growth in the form of productivity through debt or borrowing.
Eventually,ofcourse,thegapbetweensupplyanddemandbecomestoowideevenfordebtto
bridge.Whenthathappens,supplycrashes.Atthemicroeconomiclevel,facedwithamassive
inventory overhang, companies cut costs and the easiest way of doing that is to cut jobs.

It has to be said that to date, when faced with the unsatisfying results that the traditional
exchange rate models have produced as far as predicting exchange rates is concerned, the
economiccommunityhasforthemostparteitherignoredtheseinconvenientresultsordeclared
thatitisimpossibletoforecastshort-termexchangeratemovesastheyaredeterminedbythe

its honesty as well as its intellectual acumen, which has “fessed up” to both the failure of

The majority of the time, however, the reaction to the obvious question has been denial or
the random walk excuse. According to the latter, since traditional exchange rate models do
notappearabletopredictshort-termexchangeratemoves,itmustfollowlogicallythatsuch
short-term exchange rate moves cannot in fact be predicted at all and must therefore follow
a “random walk” path, suggesting an equal probability of appreciating or depreciating over

Currency Economics:
A More Focused Framework
In the previous chapter, we had a pretty detailed look at traditional exchange rate models.
Significant research went into these models and indeed they are valuable in trying to pre-
dict long-term exchange trends. Where they fall down is their ability to predict short-term
moves.
The reaction of economists to this realization in truth has been mixed. Of late, however,
thereseemstohavebeenagradualrecognitionthatagreaterfocusisneededinapplyingthe
general rules of economics to the specific dynamics of the currency market. For want of a
betterterm,Ihavecalledthisgreaterfocus“currencyeconomics”.Ishouldsayattheoutset
this is not an attempt to create an entirely new field of currency analysis. Rather, it is to
createamorefocusedframework,usingthoseexistingeconomicprinciplesthatarerelevantto
thecurrencymarketandwhennecessaryaddingonotheranalyticaldisciplinestoprovidean
integratedapproachtocurrencyanalysis.Afterall,analysisisthemeanstoanend.Itshould
not be viewed as the end in itself. A certain degree of flexibility is needed to modify the
theory to fit better the practice. As John Maynard Keynes himself is reputed to have said,
“when things change, we change”. To a trader, this is only common sense. However, to the
moderneconomiccommunity,suchflexibilityappearsfrequentlyelusive.Further,whilethe
more flexible economists have pondered how to make the traditional exchange rate models
more accurate in predicting exchange rate moves, other disciplines appear to have got there
before them. To a considerable degree, technical and flow analysis have succeeded where
classicaleconomicshasyetto.WewilllookattheseindetailinChapters3and4,butfornow
the point has to be acknowledged that these disciplines have had success precisely because
they have focused on solving the problem of predicting short-term exchange rate moves.
Yet, if exchange rates are only subject to random walk theory over short-term periods, how
can this be so? The answer is obvious and it is this—they are not subject to random walk
theory, but instead can over short time periods demonstrate clear and identifiable patterns,
patternsthatcanbeusedtopredicttheirmovements.Thisisnottosaytheywillbepredicted

thattherearelags,sometimessubstantiallags,beforesuchimbalancescanbeeliminated.In
addition, supply and demand are not completely objective concepts. Rather, at least in part,
they reflect the views expressed by those market participants that make up that supply and
demand.Inotherwords,supplyanddemandarebothcauseandeffect.
Somuchforthetheory,whatdoesthismeaninpractice?Actually,toamarketpractitioner,
these ideas are relatively obvious. Currency interbank dealers know full well that particular
flows will have more effect than others and thus will materially affect the supply/demand
dynamics.Sayalargemultinationalcorporationtransactsanend-of-quarterhedgeintheEuro–
dollarexchangerate.Granted,thisisthemostliquidcurrencypairintheworld,butiftheflow

the term “future” means different things to different people. To the multinational, it means
monthsatleastifnotyears.Totheinterbankdealertransactingtheflowinthemarketplaceit
meansminutesorhoursatmost.Currencymarketsareessentiallyflow-drivenovershorttime
frames, and therefore it is vital to understand the relationship between supply and demand
dynamics.
Just as supply and demand are not independent of one another and are both cause and
effect,sotherelationshipbetween“speculation”andeconomicfundamentalsisalsonotjust
one-way.Economictheoryrequiresthatmarketseliminate“speculativeexcess”,thusrestoring
equilibrium. However, we have already established that “equilibrium” is actually a moving
target. If the “speculative excess” is the extent to which markets diverge from equilibrium,
thenthat“speculativeexcess”isalsoamovingtarget.Finally,thepresumptionofeconomists

isthateconomicfundamentalsdrivemarketpricingandthustoanextentspeculativeexcess.
Evenifweacceptthis,ithasalsotobeacknowledgedthatspeculativeexcesscaninturnaffect

Polishzlotywasoneofthetopthreestrongestcurrenciesintheworld,poweringaheadonthe
backoftheirresistiblecombinationofportfolioanddirectinvestmentinflows.Itisprobably
safetoassumethatonthebackofthistrend—saidtrendprovingthatsupplyanddemandare
not independent—speculative flows also bought the Polish zloty to profit from anticipated
capital and carry gains. Here, we define “speculative” flow as that which has no underlying
commercialorfinancialmarkettransactionbehinditbutinsteadispurelyacurrencymarket
transaction for the purpose of a directional bet. For our example, we have used the Polish
zloty’s“basket”value,whichismadeupof55%Euroand45%USdollaragainstthezloty.
InFigure2.1,theapparent“downtrend”inthePolishzlotyagainstitsbasketactuallyrep-
resentscurrencyappreciationratherthandepreciation.Itshouldbeimmediatelyobviousfrom

Yet, this trend of Polish zloty appreciation took place over a period of some nine months,
apparentlyconfirmingthatthesumofcurrencymarketparticipantsvieweditasfundamentally

2.2.1 TheStandardAccountingIdentityforEconomicAdjustment
WelookedatthisbrieflyinChapter1,buttorecapitisexpressedas:
S−I =Y −E = X −M
where:
S = Savings
I = Investment
Y = Income
E = Expenditure
X = Exports
M = Imports
This can actually be expanded by breaking down “savings” into public and private savings
suchthat:
(S +S )−I = X −M
p g
where:
S = Privatesavings
p
S = Governmentsavings
g
Here, government “dis-saving” reflects having a budget deficit. Thus, from this, we can see
immediately that there is a possible link between a budget deficit and a trade deficit. If a
country’sbudgetdeficitcontinuestorise,thisisreflectedontheleft-handsideoftheequation
by an increasingly negative value for S . Unless this is offset by a rise in private savings or
g
a fall in investment, this will eventually mean that the left-hand side of the equation turns

CurrencyEconomics 59
negative.Ofnecessityinthiscircumstance,theright-handsideoftheequationmustalsobe
negative,whichinturnmeansthatthecountryhasatradedeficit.Thus,abudgetdeficitcan
lead to a trade or a current account deficit. The link is not necessarily automatic. However,
it should be assumed that widening budget deficits, if sustained over time, lead to widening
trade and current account deficits. If we extend this, we see that at some stage widening
currentaccountdeficitswillbecomeunsustainable,requiringarealexchangeratedepreciation.
Thus,wideningbudgetdeficitsmayeventuallyrequirereal(andthusnominal)exchangerate

This is an example of how a corporation can use the accounting identity to analyse their

An institutional investor may also be concerned with currency risk, albeit from a slightly
differentperspective.Insteadofminingpreciousmetalsoutoftheground,ourinvestormay
bebuyingaportfolioofinternationalequityandfixedincomesecurities.Whetherourinvestor

tobuya10-yearUSTreasurynote,inordertodothattheyhavetobuyUSdollars.Inmarket
parlance,theyarewhethertheylikeitornot“longdollars,shortsterling”.Ifduringthetimein
which they hold the investment, sterling falls against the dollar, this is a very favourable
development which should help enhance the total return of the investment. Why? Because
when the US dollar proceeds are translated back into sterling, a fall in sterling against the
dollar means that the dollar is worth more sterling. The ensuing currency profit should thus
boostthetotalreturn.
Say, however, that sterling actually appreciates significantly against the US dollar. In this
case, any profit earned on the original investment in the US Treasury note may be reduced
or even eliminated when the proceeds are translated back into sterling. The rise in sterling
@Team-FLY

CurrencyEconomics 61
would mean that the US dollar proceeds would now be worth less sterling when translated.
Seasoned international investors are of course well aware of such considerations, but how-
ever basic the example it is worth restating. Currency risk is not always a consideration of
international investors, but it should be if they are concerned with the total return of their
portfolio.
Returningtoouraccountingidentity,let’sconsideranexample,inthiscasetheUSinthe

wasnottheimmediateconsideration.Usingtheaccountingidentityforeconomicadjustment,
let’s try and get a better idea of what was happening in the US at that time. Recapping the
identity:
S−I = X −M
A UK investor looking at the US economy during the first half of 2001 saw that the US
continuedtorunsignificanttradedeficits.Inotherwords,theright-handsideoftheequation
wassubstantiallynegative(tothetuneofaroundUSD160billion).Equally,ourinvestorwould
be able to assume that the left-hand side of the equation was also negative. At the time, the
USwasstillrunningbudgetsurpluses,sothecombinationof(S +S )waspositive,meaning
p g
that the culprit for the trade deficit was booming investment. This also reflected booming
inward investment, more than offsetting the massive trade deficit. As a result, the US dollar
rosesubstantiallyduringthefirsthalfof2001.
FromJuly2001howeverthingschanged.Marketparticipantsbegantoquestiontheability
of the Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan to engineer the economic recovery
miracle that everyone had been hoping for. Declining domestic demand in the US meant
decliningimportdemand.Intermsoftheaccountingidentity,thismeantthatM wasdeclining
relativeto X,inturnreducingthetradedeficit.Thisisindeedwhatwesawduringthesecond
half of the year, even before September 11. The US trade deficit shrunk from over USD30
billion a month to around 25 billion, a decline of over 16%. On the left-hand side of the
accounting identity, as M fell relative to X on the right-hand side, so I declined relative to
S.Lowerdomesticinvestmentwouldsurelybereflectiveoflowerinwardinvestment.Again,

inflation.Itisviewedasagoodindicatorofmedium-tolong-termcurrencyvaluation.Ifwelook

However, there are important clues as to when that REER appreciation may be about to
end. Such REER appreciation usually causes significant trade and current account balance
deterioration. The fact that this does not have an immediate reaction in the exchange rate
confirms not only the existence of the J-curve but also the presence of significant capital
inflows.Suchinflowscanoffsetawideningtradedeficitforaperiodoftime,buteventually

Flow:
Tracking the Animal Spirits
Withinfinancialcircles,ithasbecomecommonplacetotalkabouttheimportanceof“flow”
in forecasting exchange rates. International organizations and academic bodies now publish

Allofthismarksamajordeparturefromthepreviousorthodoxy.Aswelookedatinthefirst

includingtheviewthatmarketsareessentiallyrational,thatinformationisperfect(i.e.available
to everyone, all of the time) and that divergences from fundamental equilibrium levels will
eventuallybeeliminated.Becauseofthis,itwasalsoassumeduntilquiterecentlythatthere
was little point in studying financial market “flow”. If a price is the result of all available
information at one time, and if all information is equally available to all concerned within
thefinancialmarkets,flowinformationcannotaddanyvalueorhaveanypriceeffectasthat
informationisalreadyknown.Moreover,economicfundamentalswilldictateovertimethat

Insum,theeconomistsdeemedthemselvesasbeinginfullcontrolofwhattheyappearedto
perceiveastheratherunseemlyelementsofthefinancialmarkets,i.e.theactualparticipants.
Economicswasthe“cause”andcapitalflowthe“effect”.
Some within the economic community diverged somewhat from this polar view, notably
one John Maynard Keynes, who coined the term “the animal spirits”, referring to the stock
market and the way in which economic theory and financial market prices interacted. More

When economic or financial calamity occurs, it is not surprising that governments react
against this, not least because they do not want to seem to be blamed themselves and thus
seek to blame others. In the context of capital flows, however, there seems to be a double

While the reversal in the IMM speculative position in the yen may be a notable change

In the example in Figure 3.1, CitiFX Flows shows global client flow going through the
Euro–dollar exchange rate over the time period from August to October 2001, comparing
that flow against the spot Euro–dollar exchange rate. Looking at the last month’s worth of
flow in this example, we see a consistent picture of the flow model’s client base selling the

This is again most easily explained using a chart. While Figure 3.1 provided a good flow
pictureovertheshortterm,showingincreasinglyheavysellingoftheEuro–dollarexchange
rate by the flow model’s global client base, Figure 3.2 takes a longer-term perspective of
flow trends. More specifically, it compares the Euro trade-weighted exchange rate against
the medium-term Euro exposure indicator. Obviously, before the January 1, 1999 start to
the Euro as a tradable currency both measures are synthetic. Here we see that the model’s
client base exposure to the Euro has continued to move to a medium-term underweight
from mid-2000 onwards, despite the fact that during this time the trade-weighted Euro re-
mained relatively stable. We can derive from this that at some stage reversion to mean will
requireEurobuyingtoclosethatsignificantunderweightexposureof1.5standarddeviations.
What such a chart does not tell us, unfortunately, is when that might happen. Combining
the two charts, however, we get a picture both of the short-term flow momentum and of the
medium-term positional considerations. Together they can help to provide a relatively ex-
haustiveflowpictureofanexchangerate.Thisinturncanprovidebothtradingandhedging

In order to reinforce the point, it is probably useful to conduct the same exercise using

looksatthemedium-termexposureindicatorofthemarketasreflectedbythemodel’sclient
baseasagainstthemedium-termtrendinthetrade-weightedvalueoftheyen.
Comparing the two charts, we get a very informed picture of the flow vs. the spot price
action in the Japanese yen. In the case of Figure 3.3, the thing to note is that the flow was
largely in line with the spot dollar–yen price action. More interesting is the fact that the
flow continued to show heavy selling of dollars against the yen even in the face of adverse

yen exchange rate. Figure 3.4 shows the more medium- to long-term flow picture in the
yen. Through mid-1998, the exposure indicator showed an increasing underweight position
in the yen. From then on, the underweight was continually reduced until mid-1999 when it
flipped to an overweight position. Medium-term exposure indicators are useful in that they
imply a reversion to mean, and in this case that would mean the flow moving back to a
more neutral reading, which would require significant selling of yen. Thus, combining the

two, we get a picture of short-term flows favouring a lower dollar–yen exchange rate, but
the medium-term flow picture favouring a potentially significant rebound in favour of the
dollar.

Whiletheseflowandsentimentmodelsvary,bothintermsofthetimespantheyfocusonandthe

However,currencymarketpractitionersdonotnecessarilyhavethatlongtowait.Therefore,
itisnecessarytostudyorderflowseparatelyandindependentlyfromthefundamentals,and
moreoveritisnecessarytostudythedriversofthatorderflow.Thatiswhatwehaveattempted
hereinthischapter.
Thekeydistinctionbetweenaspeculativeandanon-speculativecapitalflow,keepingtothe
definition that we are using for speculation—which is that speculation involves the buying
andsellingofcurrencieswithnounderlyingattachedasset—istheexchangerateitself.For
a speculator, the exchange rate is the primary incentive for investing, using this definition.
However,foranassetmanager,theexchangerateisnottheprimaryconsideration,whichis
the total return available in the local markets. As the barriers to capital have broken down
and as currencies have been de-pegged and allowed to float freely, so both speculative and
non-speculative capital flows have grown exponentially. There remains a dynamic tension
betweenthetwo,allowingoneorothertobemoreimportantintermsoftotalflowsatanyone

incentivebehindspeculativeflow,usingourdefinitionofspeculation,isthatitismainlydriven
by the exchange rate not the interest rate. If it were the latter, neither the Japanese yen nor
the Swiss franc would ever have risen. Yet, since the 1971–1973 break-up of the Bretton

The Art of Charting
Technical analysis has much in common with the major principles at work in flow analysis.
Bothfocusonbehaviouralpatternswithinfinancialmarkets.Bothclaimthatmarketbehaviour
canindeedimpactfutureprices.Inaddition,bothreflectabeliefthatmarketsmustmoveand
tradersmusttradeirrespectiveofwhetherornottherearechangesineconomicfundamentals.
In this sense, if flow and technical analysis did not exist, they would have to be invented.
Demandwilleventuallyresultinsupply!
Inthischapter,wetakealookatthecoreideasbehindthefascinatingandcontroversialfield
oftechnicalanalysis,itsorigins,howitworksanditsmainanalyticalbuildingblocks.Forthose
lookingtostudythisfieldinmoredepth,Iprovideusefulreferencesinthefootnotes.Whereas
flowanalysisfocusesonpricetrendsthatarecreatedbyorderflow,technicalanalysisfocuses
on price patterns within those trends. Technical analysis remains a controversial subject for
manypeople.Despitesuchcontroversy,itsoriginsarerootedinmathematicsandithasbeen
aroundinoneformoranotherforaverylongtimeindeed.
4.1 ORIGINSANDBASICCONCEPTS
At least in its modern version, technical analysis is generally seen as emanating from the
“Dow Theory” established by Charles Dow at the start of the twentieth century. The core
originalideasoftechnicalanalysisfocusedonthetrendingnatureofprices,theideaofsupport
andresistanceandtheconceptofvolumemirroringchangesinprice.Thoughweonlytouch
on it here, the contribution of Charles Dow to modern-day technical analysis should not be
underestimated. His focus on the basics of security price movement helped to give rise to a
completelynewmethodofanalysingfinancialmarketsingeneral.
Thebasicpremisebehindthisisthatthepriceofasecurityrepresentsaconsensus.Atthe
individual level, it is the price at which one person is willing to buy and another to sell. At
themarketlevel,itisthepriceatwhichthesumofmarketparticipantsiswillingtotransact.The
willingnesstobuyorselldependsonthepriceexpectationsofindividualmarketparticipants.
Becausehumanexpectationsarerelativelyunpredictable,sothesamemustbesaidfortheir
price expectations. If we were all totally logical and could separate our emotions from our
investmentdecisions,oneshouldassumethatclassicfundamentalanalysiswouldbeabetter
predictoroffuturepricesthanitcurrentlyis.Priceswouldonlyreflectfundamentalvaluations.
Thefactthatthisisnotthecasesuggeststhatotherforcesmaybeatwork.Indeed,investor
expectationsalsoplayapart,bothattheindividuallevelandalsoasagroup.
Technical analysis is the process of analysing a currency or financial security’s historical
priceinanattempttodetermineitsfuturepricedirection.Itisfoundedinthebeliefthatthere
areconsistentpatternswithinpriceaction,whichinturnhavepredictableresultsintermsof

customerorder:

Takeprofit

Stoploss
There are important differences in the way that these two specific types of customer order
tend to cluster. For instance, take profit orders tend to cluster in front of important support
or resistance levels and thus tend to have the habit of causing the trend to reverse—thus
reinforcingthatsupportorresistance—iftheyaresufficientinnumber.Bycontrast,stoploss
orders tend to be clustered behind important support or resistance levels, thus accelerating
andintensifyingtheprevailingtrendiftriggered.Academicresearchhasfoundthattakeprofit
andstoplosscustomerorders,whichimposesomedegreeofconditionalityontheorder,can
make up between 10 and 15% of total order flow. As a result, they can have an important
effectontradingconditionsandthereforeonpricepatterns.Duringcalmmarketconditions,
theycanfurtherrestrictpriceaction.Conversely,duringvolatilemarketconditions,theycan
exacerbate price volatility when such orders are triggered. Thus, both in calm and volatile
market conditions, they re-emphasize the original importance of the support and resistance
levels.

4.3.2 TheStudyofTrends
Atitsheart,technicalanalysisrepresentsthestudyofpricetrends(oranticipatedtrends).In
priceterms,attheirmostbasic,thesecanbedividedintouptrendsanddowntrends.Withinsuch
trends, we see points where little price action occurs and conversely other points reflecting
substantialpriceactionandmarkettension.Theideabehindsupportandresistanceisthatif
the price action fails to exceed a certain level, then that level becomes important. Thus, if a
pricefailstoexceedahighandfallsback,wecallthathigharesistance.Equally,iftheprice
action fails to get below a low price level, then that low price level becomes support. Price
trends reflecting a number of support and resistance levels are reflected by trend-lines (see
Figure4.2).
Resistanceorsupportcanbeformedaroundsuchatrend-line.Notethatatthebottomright
of Figure 4.2, the price of the Euro–dollar exchange rate breaks up through the trend-line.
Fromthis,wecansaythatithasbrokentrend-lineresistance.Thus,wecandescribesupport
and resistance levels as levels where a trend may be interrupted or reversed. Because such
levelscandeterminethecontinuationorthecessationofatrend,theyareseenasimportantby
marketparticipants.Inthisexample,marketparticipantsmaywellhaveleftstoplossordersto
buyEuroandselldollarsabovethetrend-lineresistanceontheviewthatifsuchalevelbroke

trendcouldwellbeaccelerated.Furthermore,speculativeelementscoulddiscoversuchorders
andtrytotargettheminordertocausewhatmightbecomeaself-fulfillingmove,allowingfor
potentialprofits.
To identify support and resistance levels, technical analysts use a variety of information
inputs, including but not exclusive to chart analysis and numerical rules based on previous
priceperformance.Therulewithsupportandresistanceisthattheyareimportantuntilthey
arebroken.Thismayseemlikejuststatingtheobvious,butthekeythingtonoteisthatthere

A further complication within technical analysis is that there are various ways in which
chartscanbedrawn.InFigures4.3–4.5,welookatthethreemaintypes:
(cid:1)
Line
(cid:1)
Candlestick
(cid:1)
Bar
The basic chart, which is a simple line chart (Figure 4.3), is as the title suggests formed
fromasingleline.Ofnecessitythatlinemustbeformedbyaseriesofhighs,lows,openor
closing levels. Thus, it is an approximation of the price action over a given time, reflecting
moretheoveralltrendratherthantheintradaypriceaction.Yet,highsandlowscanbejustas
important as that trend, hence the bar chart (Figure 4.4) is also useful. Sometimes, for the
same instrument, security or exchange rate, the line and bar charts can show quite different
supportandresistancelevels.Yet,itcanalsobeimportantwhenpreciselythosehighsandlows
occurred.Forinstance,theimplicationofpriceactiononanygivendaymaybequitedifferent
ifthehighinpriceactionoccursatthestartorattheendofamove.Forthisreason,analysis
usingacandlestickchart(Figure4.5)canbeuseful.
Thesearethethreemostbasictypesofchart.Forallthree,wecanuseanumberoftech-
nical tools and schools of thought to try and develop predictive knowledge from past price
patterns. Before we go on to some of the more complex tools, it is probably worth having
anotherlookatsupportandresistance,accompaniedbyanotherbuildingblock—themoving
average.Asthenamesuggests,thisistheaverageoftheexchangeratevaluesoverasettime
period.Becausethatexchangerateisconstantlymoving,soistheaveragerateofnecessity.
Movingaveragescanbestudiedaccordingtoperiodsofanylength,butthemostwidelyused
andthusmostimportantarethe20-,55-and200-dayandthe55-and200-weekmovingaver-
ages.Thusarmedwiththeinitialbuildingblocksofsupport,resistanceandmovingaverages,
let’s try to do some technical analysis, using the chart of the Euro–dollar exchange rate in
Figure4.6.
Here,wehaveourEuro–dollarexchangeratewiththefollowingtechnicaltools:

Atrend-line

So, what can we tell from this chart? A layman might not be able to tell much apart from
thefactthatEuro–dollarhasbeeninadowntrend.Sometimes,suchbasicobservations,made

This became known as the Fibonacci sequence, as coined by the French mathematician
EdouardLucas(1842–1891).AstheFibonaccisequenceprogresses,aclearrelationshipbe-

ThelinkbetweenFibonacciandfinancialmarketscomesthroughanotherschoolofthought
fortechnicalanalysis,ElliottWaveTheory,namedafterRalphNelsonElliott(1871–1948).
Elliott first made the connection between his Wave Theory and the Fibonacci sequence of
numbersinhisbookNature’sLaw—TheSecretoftheUniverse(1946).ElliottWaveTheory
suggests financial markets move in five waves of progression followed by three waves of
regression. As such a 5–3 wave move completes a wave cycle. The five “up” waves are
labelled1–5,whilethethree“down”wavesarelabelleda–c.Ofnecessity,waves1,3and5
areseenasimpulsivewaveswhilewaves2and4areseenascorrective.
RememberingtheFibonaccisequence,itshouldbeimmediatelyobviousthat1,3and5are
Fibonaccinumbers.Furthermore,ifwebreakeachwavedownintosub-waves,wenoticetwo

In sum, Fibonacci levels can provide crucial tops and bottoms in the market and are widely

beenwidelypracticedbytradersforaverylongtime—centuriesratherthanyears.Thefirst

analysis should be a consideration for all types of currency market practitioner. Short-term
traders are likely to use it as their primary analytical tool ahead of fundamental analysis
because it is better suited to predicting short-term exchange rate moves than the traditional
fundamental exchange rate models. Corporations and asset managers can use it as a cross-
checkoftheirfundamentalviewsandalsointermsoftimingtheirhedgingactivity.Thefact
thattraderswatchtechnicallevelsandthattradersmakeupthemajorityofcurrencymarket

Exchange Rate Regimes:

Tomostmodern-dayreaders,atleastthosewithinthedevelopedmarkets,theexchangerate

such a test would have been inconceivable. Freely floating exchange rates are themselves a
relativelyrecentphenomenon.Indeed,theperiodsince1973andthebreak-upoftheBretton

neveranysuggestion—orconception—thatgovernmentswerenotincharge.For27years,
theBrettonWoodssystemheldinplace,helpingtoprovideafoundationforeconomicgrowth
inthe1950sand1960s.
Then, as the value of the US dollar peg to gold came under ever increasing pressure, the
US eventually scrapped its gold peg, trying in the process to create a slightly more flexible
exchange rate system under the Smithsonian Agreement. In 1973, the effort to defend this
too was exhausted and collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions. Thus, since
1973, we have had for the first time an international monetary system which has for the
most part been characterized by freely floating exchange rates among the major industrial
countries,freeofofficialinterventionorcommodity-relatedpegs,with“themarket”takingan
increasinglyimportantrole,bothrelativetobefore1973andalsotoofficialgovernmentpolicy.

What has become far more common is that central banks will attempt to guide the market
through“verbalintervention”.Theextentoftheaccommodationarrivedatbythemarketand

5.2.1 TheRiseofCapitalFlows
A key reason for the move by emerging markets from pegged exchange rates to floating
exchange rates has been the rise in the importance of global capital flows and the extent to
whichemergingmarketshaveparticipatedinandbeenintegratedwithinthosecapitalflows.
As stated, the rise in the importance of capital flows since the early 1980s reflects the wave
ofcapitalaccountliberalizationandcapitalmarketintegrationthathastakenplacesincethat

The basic argument in favour of flexible exchange rates is that it makes it easier for an
economytoadjusttoexternalshocks,suchasadramaticchangeincommoditypriceswhichin

however, the central bank’s focus on internal price stability frees it from the obligation of
targetingtheexchangerate.

with how the choice of exchange rate regime actually affects currency market practitioners
in practice. As the exchange rate regimes of both developed and emerging markets are still
evolving, it is difficult to find definitive answers. That said, based on what we have already
looked at we can draw some useful conclusions. For a start, “fixed” currency pegs are not

Model Analysis:
Can Currency Crises be Predicted?
The type of exchange rate regime is important for normal market trading conditions, but it
is especially important for abnormal periods of market stress that may lead ultimately to a
“currencycrisis”.Inthischapter,welookspecificallyatthephenomenonofcurrencycrises
andwhetherornottheycanbepredicted.
In the wake of the emerging market crises in Mexico (1994–1995), Asia (1997–1998),
Russia (1998), Brazil (1999) and Turkey (2001), considerable effort has been made by the
academicandfinancialcommunitiestocreatemodelsthatmightbeabletopredictsuchcrises

lulled investors into a false sense of security—though that false sense of security in some

to external, US dollar-priced debt. While Asian currencies could not move, this was not an
issue. Implicitly however, it meant if Asian currencies were ever allowed to depreciate, the
capital base of those same corporate and banking sectors would be severely depleted if not
eliminated. Asian currency devaluation would mean the cost of repaying that external debt
wouldbemultipliedbytheextentofthatdevaluation.

During Phase III, Asian currencies appreciated on the back of the liquidity-based rally.
However, during Phase IV, trade and current account surpluses peak as import demand hits

as anticipated by the model. Nonetheless, the key aspects of the model—the turnaround in

Candidly, the problem with any economic model is that it does not, indeed cannot, take
account of what we call “event risk”. That is to say, it cannot by definition allow for events
which occur unexpectedly and which can and often do cause temporary or even extended
reversalsinmarketsentiment.TheCEMCmodelisnodifferentinthis.Itsaimistoprovidea

exchange rate regime. Equally, pegged currencies that experienced the greatest degree of
real exchange rate appreciation also had the greatest degree of trade and current account
deterioration. The one major exception was China, which in 1994–1995 experienced a real
depreciation,thuscushioningthecurrentaccountbalance(asignificantsurplus)fromtheafter-
effectsoftheAsiancrisisin1997–1998.Byearly1997,itwascleartherewereovervaluation
concerns over several Asian currencies and that such overvaluation had been a major factor
in current account deterioration. There were two possible macroeconomic responses. Either
domestic prices collapsed to reduce the lost trade competitiveness as reflected by current
account deterioration or the currency experienced a real depreciation to offset the previous
appreciation.Intheend,thecurrencytookmostoftheburdenofadjustment,andinspectacular
fashion.
Thelessonfromthisisthatthetypeofexchangerateregimehasamajorinfluenceonthereal
exchangerateperformanceandthusinturnonthetradebalance.Indeed,thetypeofexchange
rateregimecoupledwithanevent—suchastheUSdollar’srealexchangerateappreciation—
led to a series of events. While the degree of eventual market reaction (the Asian currency
crisis) could not have been and generally was not predicted, the series of events itself was
predictable.Forthisveryreason,wecandeducetwothings:
(cid:1)
The Asian currency crisis happened because of fundamental imbalances created by the
exchangerateregime.

A model can be created to reflect this series of events for the purpose of looking at other

Floatingexchangerateregimesbehavedifferentlyasthetransmissionmechanismfromthe

an example, let’s look again at the Polish zloty during 2001. During the first half of 2001,
the zloty was one of the top performing currencies in the world against both the Euro and
the dollar, supported by heavy capital inflows. Then, in early July 2001, it collapsed. What
happened?InApril2000,theNationalBankofPolandhadmadeoneofitssmartestdecisions,

Eventually,speculativebuying(selling)isoverwhelmedbyfundamentalselling(buying)and
the exchange rate trend reverses. Sometimes, this reversal is sudden and dramatic, as in the
cases of the Polish zloty and the Japanese yen. Somewhat helpfully, ahead of that reversal,
option volatility tends to start rising, which currency market practitioners should view as a

warning of the reversal to come. This is indeed what happened with the zloty and the yen.

applied to developed market currencies, there are specific considerations with these such as
“safe haven” and “reserve currency” status, which distort all models. This particular model
is particularly effective with freely floating emerging market currencies, given how capital
inflows influence nominal and real interest rates. In the case of the CEMC model, we used

6.2 AMODELFORFREELYFLOATINGEXCHANGERATES
6.2.1 PhaseI:CapitalInflowsandRealExchangeRateAppreciation
Theory
Under a pegged exchange rate, capital flows are attracted by the perception of exchange
ratestabilitycreatedbythepegitself.Conversely,underfreelyfloatingexchangerates,such
capital flows are attracted by the prospect of high returns, either of income or capital gain.
Fundamentalflowsareattractedtoacurrency,attractedbothbycurrencyandunderlyingasset

Polish bonds, while cross-over investors increased their exposure to what was an off-index
investment.
6.2.2 PhaseII:SpeculatorsJointheCrowd—TheLocalCurrencyContinuestoRally

If we look at what happens within the developed exchange rates, the speculative cycle of
exchange rates also has major relevance, with the proviso that it takes place over a much
longer period of time. The starting place for developed market exchange rates is of course
the US dollar. If we examine the performance of the US dollar from 1991 to 2001, we can
indeedseethespeculativecycleofexchangeratesatwork.Roughlyspeaking,from1991to
1995,theUSdollarwasinacleardowntrend.Initially,thiswasduetofundamentalconcerns,
both of valuation and of growth prospects. The Gulf War in 1990–1991 gave way to a deep
ifbriefrecessionin1991–1992.From1993,thiswasexacerbatedbythemarket’sincreasing
view that the new Clinton administration had a deliberate policy of devaluing the US dollar
in order to boost US export competitiveness and reduce the US trade and current account
deficits, particularly against Japan. While US officials now say that this was never the case,
at the time US officials made repeated statements that could easily have been interpreted as
such,suggestingtheUSwantedaweakercurrency.Fundamentalinvestorsincreasinglysold

to fall in value against all of its major currency counterparts, such as the Japanese yen and
the German Deutschmark. This increasingly happened as the fundamentals of the US were
startingtoimprove,helpedinlargepartbythedollardepreciationthathadreducedthatUS
trade deficit by making US exports more competitive. Fundamental investors started to get
backintoUSassets,howeverthespeculators,attractedevenmorebyirresponsibleUSofficial
comments on the currency, were still selling. Eventually, the patience of the US authorities
snappedandtheFederalReserveintervenedonseveraloccasionsin1995tostemthetideof
speculative selling. The current Undersecretary of the US Treasury Peter Fisher was at the
time the head of open market operations at the New York Fed and therefore responsible for
theFed’sinterventionintheforeignexchangemarkets.FisherexplainedtheFed’saimnotso

significantlyinnumberandthespeculatorsreversedandalsostartedbuying.
Thus, the speculative cycle worked, albeit with somewhat of a delay due to the view that
the US was deliberately trying to devalue its own currency. From 1995, the US dollar thus
has been on a trend of appreciation, more than reversing the weakness seen in 1991–1995.

Inrecentyears,theeconomiccommunityhasdevelopedaverylargenumberofexchange

them. That said, they can be classified into three broad categories of currency crisis model.

basictypeofcurrencyriskwhichacorporationfaces.
7.2.2 TranslationRisk
Translation risk is slightly more complex and is the result of the consolidation of parent
companyandforeignsubsidiaryfinancialstatements.Thisconsolidationmeansthatexchange
rateimpactonthebalancesheetoftheforeignsubsidiariesistransmittedortranslatedtothe
parent company’s balance. Translation risk is thus balance sheet currency risk. While most
largemultinationalcorporationsactivelymanagetheirtransactioncurrencyrisk,manyareless
awareofthepotentialdangersoftranslationrisk.
The actual translation process in consolidating financial statements is done either at the
averageexchangerateoftheperiodorattheexchangerateattheperiodend,dependingonthe
specificaccountingregulationsaffectingtheparentcompany.Asadirectresult,theconsoli-
datedresultswillvaryaseithertheaverageortheend-of-periodexchangeratevaries.Thus,
all foreign currency-denominated profit is exposed to translation currency risk as exchange
ratesvary.Inaddition,theforeigncurrencyvalueofforeignsubsidiariesisalsoconsolidated
ontheparentcompany’sbalancesheet,andthatvaluewillvaryaccordingly.Translationrisk

Problemscanoccurwithregardtotranslationriskifacorporationhassubsidiarieswhose
accounting books are local currency-denominated. For consolidation purposes, these books
must of course be translated into the currency of the parent company, but at what exchange
rate? Income statements are usually translated at the average exchange rate over the period.
However,decidingatwhatexchangeratetotranslatethebalancesheetisslightlymoretricky.

risk relates to net assets or shareholder funds. This has become the most popular method
of translating balance exposure of foreign subsidiaries, both in the US and worldwide. On
theotherhand,themonetary/non-monetarymethodtranslatesmonetaryitemssuchasassets,
liabilitiesandcapitalattheclosingrateandnon-monetaryitemsatthehistoricalrate.Finally,
the temporal method breaks balance sheet items down in terms of whether they are firstly
statedatreplacementcost,realizablevalue,marketvalueorexpectedfuturevalue,orsecondly
statedathistoriccost.Forthefirstgroup,thesearetranslatedattheclosingexchangerateof

therehasbeenashiftamongmultinationalcorporationstowardsusingtheaverageratherthan
the closing rate because this is seen as a truer reflection of the translation risk faced by the
corporationduringtheperiod.
Translation risk is a crucial issue for corporations. Later in this chapter, we will look at
methodsofhedgingit.Fornow,itisimportanttogetanideaofhowitcanaffectthecompany’s
overallvalue.
Example
TakeanexampleofaEuro-basedmanufacturerwhichhasboughtafactoryinPoland.Needless
tosay,thecostbaseinPolandissubstantiallybelowthatoftheparentcompany,oneofseveral
majorreasonswhytheacquisitionwasmadeinthefirstplace.From1999to2001,theEuro
was on a major downtrend, not just against its major currency counterparts but also against
mostcurrenciesoftheCentralandEastEuropeanarea,suchasthePolishzloty.Thusweget
thefollowingsimplemodel:
EUR–USD↓=EUR–PLN↓
where:
EUR–USD=TheEuro–USdollarexchangerate
EUR–PLN=TheEuro–Polishzlotyexchangerate
Thisisanover-simplificationtobesure.Foronething,thePolishzlotywaspeggedtoabasket
of Euro (55%) and US dollar (45%) with a crawl and trading bands up until 2000, and thus
wasunabletoappreciatedespitetheongoingdeclineinthevalueoftheEuroacrosstheboard.
Foranother,itdoesnottakeaccountofEUR–PLNvolatility.Thatsaid,generalEuroweakness
hasclearlybeenanimportantfactorinthedepreciationoftheEuro–zlotyexchangerate.Note
howeverthatastheEuro–zlotyexchangeratehasdepreciatedforthisandotherreasonssothe

7.2.3 EconomicRisk
Thetranslationofforeignsubsidiariesconcernstheconsolidatedgroupbalancesheet.However,
this does not affect the real “economic” value or exposure of the subsidiary. Economic risk
focuses on how exchange rate moves change the real economic value of the corporation,
focusing on the present value of future operating cash flows and how this changes in line
withexchangeratechanges.Morespecifically,theeconomicriskofacorporationreflectsthe
effect of exchange rate changes on items such as export and domestic sales, and the cost of
domesticandimportedinputs.Aswithtranslationrisk,calculatingeconomicriskiscomplex,
but clearly necessary to be able to assess how exchange rate changes can affect the present
valueofforeignsubsidiaries.Economicriskisusuallyappliedtothepresentvalueoffuture
operatingcashflowsofacorporation’sforeignsubsidiaries.However,itcanalsobeapplied
to the parent company’s operations and how the present value of those change in line with
exchangeratechanges.

tionalexposuresuchasaccountsreceivable/payableordividends.Translationriskfocuseson

tweenthecurrencyinwhichcashflowsaredenominatedandthecurrencythatmaydetermine
thenatureandsizeofthosecashflows.Thetwoarenotnecessarilythesame.Tocomplicate
theissuefurther,thereisthesmallmatteroftheparentcompany’scurrency,whichisusedto
consolidate the financial statements. If a parent company has foreign currency-denominated
debt, this is recorded in the parent company’s currency, but the value of its legal obligation
remainsinthecurrencydenominationofthedebt.Insum,transactionriskisjustthetipofthe
iceberg!
Ofnecessity,therealityofcurrencyriskisverycase-specific.Thatsaid,therehasbeenan
attempt by the academic and economic communities to apply the traditional exchange rate
modelstothecorporateworldforthepurposeofdemonstratinghowexchangeratesimpacta

The international Fisher effect suggests that the expected change in the exchange rate is
equaltotheinterestratedifferential.
(cid:1)
The unbiased forward rate theory suggests that the forward exchange rate is equal to the
expectedexchangerate.

Generally,thesetheoriesaregroundedintheefficientmarkethypothesisandthereforeflawed

7.3 MANAGINGCURRENCYRISK
TransactionalcurrencyriskcanbehedgedtacticallyorstrategicallybythecorporateTreasury

Translational currency risk is usually hedged opportunistically rather than systematically,
notablytotrytoavoidemergingmarket-relatedshockstonetassets,usuallyfocusingoneither

Hedgingeconomicriskiscomplex,requiringthecorporationtoforecastitsrevenueandcost

rate deviation from the rate used in calculating revenue and cost. For the debt structure, the
currencyofdenominationmustbechosen,theamountofdebtestimatedinthatcurrencyand
the average interest period determined. The effect on cash flow should be netted out over
productlinesandacrossmarkets.What’sleftfromthisprocessistheeconomicriskthathas
to be managed. For large multinationals, the net economic risk may in fact be quite small
becauseofoffsettingeffects.However,economicriskcanbesubstantialforcorporationsthat

Thefirsttwostepsofthisprocessappeartohavebeenaccomplished.Firstly,wehavedefined
veryspecificallythetypesofcurrencyriskthatacorporationisexposedto.Secondly,wehave
looked at broad strategy, the brushstrokes of managing that currency risk. Yet, while this

However,itshouldbenotedthat:
VaRdoesnotdefinetheworstcasescenario
It may give the maximum loss for an exposure with 99% confidence using a 3000-iteration
Monte Carlo simulation. The question remains however, what happens to the exposure for

question. Thus, a degree of both care and common sense is needed. The more sophisticated

7.5 COREPRINCIPLESFORMANAGINGCURRENCYRISK
So far we have examined currency risk, how to manage and quantify it. Before we go on
from theory into practice, it may well be useful to establish a framework, a reference for
corporate Treasury of core principles of managing currency risk. There have been several
notable efforts along these lines, most notably of course the “Core Principles of Managing
Currency Risk” set out by the Group of 31 (US multinational corporations) and Greenwich
TreasuryAdvisors.
Clearly,thereisadangerinattemptinganythingevenapproachingbestpracticeforcorporate
Treasury as corporations vary so significantly in terms of their exposures, requirements and
focus. Such concerns notwithstanding, the importance of the issue equally requires that the
attempt be made to create a reference from which individual corporations can perhaps take
whatmightbeappropriatetothem.Thus,whatfollowsismyowntentativesuggestionofwhat
anysuchlistofcoreprinciplesofmanagingcurrencyriskshouldcontain:
1. Determine the types of currency risk to which the corporation is exposed—Break
these down into transaction, translation and economic risk, making specific reference to
whatcurrenciesarerelatedtoeachtypeofcurrencyrisk.
2. Establishastrategiccurrencyriskmanagementpolicy—Oncecurrencyrisktypeshave
been agreed on, corporate Treasury should establish and document a strategic currency
risk management policy to deal with these types of risks. This policy should include the
corporation’sgeneralapproachtocurrencyrisk,whetheritwantstohedgeortradethatrisk
anditscorehedgingobjectives.

7.6 HEDGING—MANAGEMENTRELUCTANCE
ANDINTERNALMETHODS
Having looked in detail at the issue of managing currency risk, we should now be looking
at the specifics of how to hedge that risk. Before we do that, we first have to examine the
issue of management reluctance to hedge a risk many see as merely an operational hazard
of international investment. Some may dismiss this section, either because it is irrelevant to
them or because they view any such approach as inappropriate. While I too share the view
thatcurrencyriskshouldbemanaged,suchmanagementreluctanceshouldnotbeignored,but
insteadshouldbeunderstoodandthereaftercombated.Threekeyreasonsforthisreluctance

Managementseesactivecurrencymanagementasoutsideofcorebusiness
Some of these points are reasonable. Currency forwards and options may well be outside
the field of expertise of a corporation’s management, and will certainly be outside the core
business operations. Many managements consider such financial instruments as speculative.

corporation.

(cid:1)

(cid:1)
Cashflowimpacts
A further disincentive is that currency translation affects the balance sheet rather than the
incomestatement,whichmaymakeitlessofanimmediatepriorityformanagement.Equity
analyststendtofocusonEBIT(orEBITDA)beforedebt/equityratios.Eventually,however,
the deterioration in balance sheet ratios can impact the corporation’s average cost of capital
andultimatelyitsvaluationinthemarketplace.
Example
EuropeanexporterswithUSsubsidiarieshaveseentwomajorbenefitsasaresultoftheEuro’s
weakness against the US dollar over the last two years. Firstly, at the direct level, this Euro
weaknesshasmadetheirexportscheapertotheUS,allowingthemtolowerexportpricesand
thusgainmarketshare.Secondly,Euroweaknesshas,justaswesawwiththepreviousPolish
example,boostedtheEurovalueoftheirUSsubsidiaries.Atsomestage,theEuro’sdecline
against the dollar may reverse. How would the corporate Treasury best cope with this? The
export question concerns transaction exposure. The question of the subsidiary’s value when
translated back into Euros is one of translation currency risk or exposure. In this case, both
types of “polar” hedge—zero or 100% hedged—seem inappropriate. The risk of the Euro
rallying on a sustained basis against the dollar may be seen by many as small, but it is not
zero. Therefore it would be inappropriate to have a zero-rate balance sheet hedge to cover
the risk of valuation loss in the subsidiary. On the other hand, it would also seem extreme
to hedge 100% of the subsidiary’s value. A neat way round this dilemma might be to use a
variablehedgeratiofornetbalancesheetexposures,whicharetriggeredbytheinterestrate

assets (gross assets less liabilities) of the subsidiary or subsidiaries that may be affected by
an adverse exchange rate move. Thus, important considerations are the financing, net cash
flows and intangibles relating to those subsidiaries. The corporation’s debt structure is also
animportantconsideration.Corporationswithhigherlocaltaxratestendtodebtfinancetheir

As it is, optimization, using a corporate risk optimizer (CROP), can be undertaken for
transaction,translationoreconomiccurrencyriskaslongasoneknowstherisksentailedand
gives a specific currency view within that. For example, if a corporation is looking for the
best and most efficient hedging strategy in emerging market currencies, a CROP model can
integrate the specific characteristics of those currencies together with the size of the expo-
sureandhedgingobjectives(efficientfrontier,performancemaximization,riskminimization).

7.12 BENCHMARKSFORCURRENCYRISKMANAGEMENT
Corporations can use a variety of hedging benchmarks to manage their hedging strategies
more rigorously. Aside from the hedging level as the benchmark (e.g. 75%), corporations
which want to limit fluctuation in net equity use the reporting period as the benchmark for
forward hedging. Typically, US companies hedge quarterly whereas European corporations
use 12-month benchmarks given different disclosure requirements. Accounting rules have a
major impact on what hedging benchmarks corporations use. Budget rates are also used to
define the benchmark hedging performance and tenor of a hedge, as these would generally
matchcashflowrequirements.

investor. Just as with corporations, there is a reluctance within some investors to hedge or
manage currency risk and for the same reasons, not least that participating in the currency

In the case of a portfolio manager who is focusing on absolute returns, the currency risk
management style that is synonymous with this focuses on reducing the risk of the overall
portfolio.Thisinturnusuallymeansadoptingapassivestyleofcurrencyriskmanagement.

and

The overall aim remains the same, and that is to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio,
maximizing the total or absolute return in the process. In other words, it is to boost the

There are four main currency hedging benchmarks used by institutional investors, which

Being100%hedgedisusuallynottheoptimalstrategy,apartfrominexceptionalcases.Equally,
using a currency hedging benchmark of 100% unhedged would seem to defeat the purpose
ofmanagingcurrencyrisk,againapartfrominexceptionalcases.Afurtherconsiderationis

Currencyhedgingbenchmarksof0%or100%areknownasasymmetricalorpolarbench-

Adoptionanduseofbenchmarksdependscriticallyonthecurrencyriskmanagementstyle,
forwhichthetypeoffundisclearlyakeydeterminant.Forinstance,apensionfundmanager
may use a fully hedged or alternatively unhedged currency benchmark to either reduce risk
on the one hand or minimize transaction costs on the other. Meanwhile, the active currency
manager will seek a partially hedged benchmark, preferably 50%, to give them as much
flexibilityandroomaspossiblewithwhichtobeabletoaddvalue.Withsuchasymmetrical
benchmark,activecurrencymanagerscantakeadvantageofbothbullandbearmarketsintheir
currencies.Inthecontextofrelativereturns,itshouldthereforebeofnosurprisethatthereis
goodevidencetosuggestthatsymmetricalbenchmarkshaveconsistentlyaddedmore“alpha”
thantheirasymmetricalcounterparts.
Example
Aclassicexampleofagroupofinternationalinvestorsthattypicallyuseonespecifictypeof
currencyhedgingbenchmarkisthatofinternationalequityfunds,whichgenerallyeitherdo
nothedgeoradoptunhedgedbenchmarks.Thoughthetechnicaldetailsaredifferentbetween
thesetwoapproaches,theyamounttothesamething.Theremaybesomedebateastowhat
should be the optimum currency benchmark for an international equity fund in terms of the
hedging ratio. However, what is clear is that the hedging ratio for these should in theory
be higher than for those funds with only a small portion of international equity risk, on the
simplepremisethatthehigherthecurrencyriskthehighertherequiredhedgeratio.Despite
this, unhedged currency benchmarks remain very popular among this group of investors. In
part, this is because many fund managers still suggest that the long-term expected return
ofcurrenciesiszeroandinadditionthatcurrencyhedginggeneratesunnecessarytransaction
costs.Furthermore,theideathatinvestinginacountrymeansinvestinginthecurrencyremains
prevalentwithininternationalequityfunds.
Forthereasonsthatwehavealreadyoutlinedearlierinthischapter,wewoulddisputeboth
these views. The very idea of long term is subjective for one thing. For another, currency

managed separately and independently from one another. Generally speaking therefore, we
would suggest having an unhedged currency benchmark would be inappropriate, even sup-
posingthecurrencyriskmanagementmotivewasforriskreductionratherthanaddingalpha.
Usingapartiallyhedgedbenchmarkcanundoubtedlyreducetheportfolio’soverallriskand
thusboostitsSharpeandinformationratios.
A possible exception to this broad disagreement with the general idea of using unhedged
benchmarksiswherethefundhasonlyasmallportionofitsassetsininternationalasopposed
todomesticequities.Indeed,iftheinternationalallocationofanequityfundisbelow10–15%,
it may not make sense to have a hedging benchmark above that allocation as that might in
factaddtotheportfolio’sriskwhiledetractingfromthereturn.Inotherwords,undercertain
circumstancesitmaymakesensetouseanunhedgedbenchmarkforthoseequityfundswith
only a small international allocation. Generally however, if an international equity fund has
an international allocation that significantly exceeds its benchmark weight, this represents
unnecessarycurrencyriskthatshouldbemanaged.

164 CurrencyStrategy
Economic theory suggests that the long-term return of a currency is zero, so how can an
activecurrencymanageraddvalueor“alpha”?Thereappeartobetwoaspectstothisquestion.
Firstly,currencymarketsaredominatedbyshort-termmovement.Thus,whiletheirlong-term

Indeed,thereisafine—andincreasing—bodyofacademicworkthatsuggeststhatcontrary
totheory,managingcurrencyriskcanindeedadd“alpha”. Amongthese,Iwilldrawoutseveral
notableexamples.Firstly,whileformulatinghis“UniversalHedgingPolicy”in1989,Fisher
Blacksuggestedthatcurrencywas,contrarytotheory,notazerosumgameandinvestorscould
indeedincreasetheirreturnsbyholdingcurrencyinventories.Needlesstosay,thiscontradicted
thewidelyheldviewthatcurrenciescouldnotprovideaddedvaluebecausecurrencymarkets
were perfectly efficient. A relatively short time after that, Mark Kritzman put forward the
view that active currency managers could take advantage of the apparent serial correlation
incurrencyreturns.SubsequentresearchbyTaylor(1990)andSilber(1994)targetedmarket
trendsasbeingbehindpersistentpositivereturnsfromcurrencymanagers.
TwofurtherresearchreportsthatshouldbementionedarethosebyStrange(1998,updated
2001)andTheFrankRussellCompany(2000).Inthefirstcase,thesurveybyBrianStrange,
as published in Pensions and Investment (15/6/98), entitled “Do Currency Managers Add

ThesecondexampleisthatoftheFrankRussellstudyofMay2000entitled“CapturingAlpha
through Active Currency Overlay”, which analysed the historical performance of currency
overlaymandatesandconfirmedtheviewthatmanagingcurrencyriskdoesindeedaddvalue
or“alpha”.
Asnotedabove,ahostofempiricalstudieshaveprovenconclusivelythatactivecurrency

relativetonothedging,incontrasttoclassicalexchangeratetheory.Inlinewiththis,anumber
ofstudieshavebeenpublishedsuggestingclearmarketinefficiencies,whichmighttherefore
betakenadvantageofbyactivecurrencymanagers.Forinstance,the1993studybyKritzman,
suggesting that the discount/premium of the currency forward contract “systematically and
significantlyoverestimatedthesubsequentchangeinthespotrate”.Kritzmanalsointroduced
theconceptofso-called“bilateralasymmetry”,referringtoabiasbyrisk-averseinvestorsfor
theperceivedpredictablereturnsoftheinterestratedifferentialasopposedtotheunpredictable
returns of the currency. Work by Choie (1993) supported these findings. Overall, a body of
informedopinionhasdeveloped,supportiveoftheviewthatactivecurrencymanagementcan
addvalue.
After finally admitting that currency markets may offer profit potential, whether over the
shortorlongterm,academictheoristshavesuggestedthatsuchprofitopportunitiesmayexist

existence of sustained profit opportunities within currency markets by suggesting that non-

Active currency management can add value because there is value to be had in currency
markets,plainandsimple.Withinthis,anactivecurrencymanagerwillclearlyfavourthemost
flexibilitypossibletoaddthatvalue,bothintermsofthecurrencybenchmarkthattheyhave
to operate under and the currencies and financial instruments with which they are allowed
to trade. For the active currency manager, the foreign currency return is not just a matter of
currency translation of the underlying asset, but also of the excess return or alpha that the
currencymanagerisabletoadd.Thealphaanactivecurrencymanagergeneratesisusually

contributionsandadviceofHenrikPedersenoftheCitiFXRiskAdvisoryGroupandEmmanuel
AcarofBankofAmerica’sRiskManagementAdvisoryGrouparegratefullyacknowledged.
8.7.1 DifferentialForwardStrategy
The core idea behind this is that of “forward rate bias”, or the reality that forward rates are
poor predictors of future spot exchange rates, in contrast to the theories of covered interest
rateparityandunbiasedforwardparity.Wehavelookedatsomeoftheacademicbackingfor
this admission earlier in this chapter, notably by Fama (1984), Kritzman (1993) and finally
BansalandDahlquist(2000),whosuggestedthatthenegativecorrelationpresentedbyFama
betweenfutureexchangeratechangesandcurrentinterestratedifferentialsiscruciallylinked
tochangesinmacroeconomicvariables.
As outlined by Acar and Maitra (2000), the differential forward strategy seeks to take
advantage of the apparent market inefficiencies as represented by “forward rate bias” by
hedgingthecurrencyriskonlywhentheinterestratedifferentialisinfavourofthehedger.That
is to say, only when the forward points are at a discount. Conversely, the currency manager
shouldnothedgecurrencyriskwhentheforwardpointsareatapremiumandconsequently
the interest rate differential would reflect a cost. More specifically, when the interest rate
differential pays the investor to hedge, the currency manager should have a hedge ratio of
100%. Conversely, when the interest rate differential costs the investor to hedge, the hedge

ratioshouldbezero.Thus,ifthecurrencymanagerisoperatingunderasymmetricalbenchmark,
themanagerwouldgooverweightthehedgeby50%whentheinterestratedifferentialisin
theirfavourandunderweightby50%whenitrepresentsacost.
Theresultsofthisstrategyhaveprovedtobeextremelyrobustandhavebeentestedacross

willhavethesamereturnsasafullforwardhedge.Equally,whentheinterestratedifferential
representsacost,thedifferentialforwardstrategywillhavethesamereturnsasanunhedged
strategy. Thus, overall, the returns of the differential forward strategy will be a function of
both fully hedged and fully unhedged strategies. The advantages of such a strategy are the
following:

Given that the differential forward strategy is based on exploiting the principle of “forward
ratebias”,itmustfollowtoanextentthatitsexpectedreturnsarealsoafunctioninturnofthe
extentofthatforwardratebiasandthusoftheinterestratedifferentialrelativetotheexpected
future interest rate differential. For any given interest rate differential, the hedging strategy
will perform best when the correlation between the hedged and unhedged returns is more
negative.
8.7.2 Trend-FollowingStrategy
Asecondpopularstrategyforactivecurrencymanagersisthe“trend-following”strategy,which
involvesusingseveraltechnicalmovingaveragestoprovidetradingorhedgingsignals.Active
currencymanagerscanusethisstrategytoeithertradearoundtheirbenchmarkinordertoadd
alpha,oralternativelytoprovideahedgingsignal.Theacademicbackingfortrend-following
strategies is as deep as that for the differential forward strategy, including works by Bilson
(1990,1993),Taylor(1990),LeBaron(1991)andLevichandThomas(1993),whichshowed
that these strategies can indeed produce consistent excess returns over sustained periods of
time. I would suggest however that the seminal breakthrough in this area came in the form
ofthenotebyLequeuxandAcar(1998),whichgavethestrategymorespecificpropertiesby
suggestingthatinordertoberepresentativeofthevariousdurationsfollowedbyinvestorsan

Example
For instance, consider the example of a Euro-based portfolio manager who invests in US
equitiesandfixedincome.Inordertoallowthepotentialforaddingalpha,theportfoliomanager
hasgivenamandatetoanactivecurrencyoverlaymanager,whoisallowedtooperateundera
symmetricalcurrencyhedgingbenchmarkwhichgivesthemostflexibilityforprovidingthat
alpha. Using a trend-following strategy, the currency overlay manager would hedge 100%
of the underlying US exposure if spot Euro–dollar broke above all three of the 32-, 61- and
117-day moving averages. If Euro–dollar was only able to break above two out of the three
movingaverages,thecurrencyoverlaymanagerwouldhedgeonlyone-thirdoftheunderlying.
Inallothercases,theywouldremainunhedged.
Aswiththedifferentialforwardstrategy,thetrend-followingstrategymayinvolvenumerous
transactionsandthusmaycausepotentialconcernforinvestorswithregardtotransactioncosts.
However, such costs have historically been small relative both to the consistent returns that
havebeenprovidedbysuchstrategiesandalsotothepotentiallossesofnothedging.Figure8.3
looks at the dollar–mark exchange rate from 1975 to 2000, showing clearly that there were
definiteandsustainedtrends,bothintheexchangerateandininterestratedifferentialswhich
could have been—and were—exploited to varying degrees by the differential forward and

Forbothaportfoliomanagerwhoislookingtohedgecurrencyriskandanactivecurrency
manager who can trade that currency risk, optimizing the carry trade can be a useful and
productive way both to reduce risk and to add alpha. Indeed, it is an improvement on the
differential forward strategy in so much as that is another expression of a basic carry trade
strategy. The optimized carry trade strategy has consistently produced good returns with of
necessitylessvolatility,resultinginhigherSharpeandinformationratios.
It should of course be noted that just as one can optimize the carry trade for improved
performance over the simple carry trade, so one can do exactly the same thing for either

degrees of exchange rate controls, which also distort exchange rate pricing and economic
activity. Exchange controls create “black market” activity and paradoxically can lead to
capitalflight.

Forward rate bias is lower in emerging markets—While forward exchange rates are
poor predictors of future spot exchange rates in the developed markets, this is less so in
many emerging markets. The exhaustive 2000 study by Bansal and Dahlquist tested the
presenceofforwardratebiasandfoundemergingmarketcurrenciesshowsignificantlyless

Historically,lowerlevelsofimpliedvolatilityinemergingmarketcurrenciesthanthecor-
responding developed market currencies has proven a good buy signal for the former. In-
tuitively, emerging market volatility should be higher, though there are periods when the
sheer weight of capital inflows forces it artificially lower. Note that emerging market im-

Whatwefindintheemergingmarketsisthatshiftsinglobalcapitalflowshavemajordomestic

Emergingmarketcurrenciestradeinthesetypesofcycles,inlinewiththe“speculativecycle”
that we looked at earlier in the book. As a result, we can tell from this that the forward
rate bias is extreme for emerging market currencies on both sides of the forward. In line

markets.Emergingmarketinterestratedifferentialswouldmeantheoreticallythataninvestor

Managing Currency Risk III—The
Speculator: Myths, Realities and How to
be a Better Currency Speculator
After looking at the different worlds of the corporation and the “real money” institutional
investor, it would be remiss of us if we did not also look at that of the “speculator”. Few
subjectsrelatedtocurrencymarketscausemorediscussion,debateoremotionforthatmatter
thancurrency“speculation”.Indeed,inthelastfewyears,currencyspeculatorshaveundergone
anotabledeteriorationinthewaytheyareregardedbyasubstantialproportionoftheacademic
andofficialcommunity.
It used to be the case in standard economic text books that “speculators” were widely
viewedasabenignforce,providingliquiditytotheproductiveareasoftheeconomysuchas
manufacturing and services, thus lowering the cost of production. Speculation was seen as
a necessary balancing force in the overall economy, which provided the liquidity not found
elsewhere.Thoseeconomistswhoacknowledgedthatinthecurrencymarketstherecouldbe
periodic if brief divergence from fundamental equilibrium also saw currency speculators as
benign in that they worked to eliminate the divergence quickly and efficiently, more or less
undertheefficientmarkethypothesis.

was keeping a “black book” of suspected foreign banks which had speculated against the
Thai baht, though the Bank of Thailand denied the existence of such a list. In Indonesia,
the Indonesian Justice Minister was reported as considering that currency speculators could
face subversion charges if their activities were found to damage the economy, and that the
ultimate penalty for economic or political subversion was death. At around the same time,
the Indonesian Republika newspaper published a public service announcement featuring a
westerner (presumably a currency speculator) wearing a terrorist mask and keffiyah in the
formofUS100dollarbills,withanunderlyingquestion“Areyouaterroristofthiscountry?”

ofAsia’sofficialprotestatitsroughhandlingwastwo-fold:firstly,anaturalreactiontosuch
treatment whatever the reasons, and secondly an issue of control—the authorities had lost
control, or at least a high degree of it, and the market had gained it. Of necessity, control is
a subject close to the heart of any government or central bank. This was the case in Europe
after the two ERM crises, and it was also the case with Asia. Control was relevant not only

On the face of it, this may seem only to confirm the worst fears of those who see currency

9.4.3 “Hedge”Funds
The very term may for some conjure up the devil incarnate. There is little question that the
imageofthehedgefundhaschangedovertime.Beforewegetontothatimage,letusfirstdeal
withwhattheydo.Thefirstthingtosayisthattherearehundreds,ifnotthousands,ofdifferent
typesofhedgefund.Theterm“hedgefund”isinfactanextremelyvagueone,encompassing

specifichedgefundsmayseemparticularlysynonymouswiththeterm,butwhiletheirfunds
aresomeofthelargesttheyareinfactthetipoftheproverbialicebergintermsofreflecting
thissectionofthefinancialcommunity.
For a start, most of them unlike their name do not hedge. Indeed, their aim is to take
asset market or currency views, to increase risk albeit selectively rather than to hedge risk.
Ratherthantieupbalancesheetcapitalthroughspotpositions,theyfrequentlyusederivatives
to express a view, using leverage. The amount of leverage that hedge funds are allowed to
use has decreased significantly since the failure of LTCM in 1998. Hedge funds are still
active participants in the currency markets, though their involvement has in fact diminished
substantially for a number of reasons. Firstly, the LTCM failure caused the counterparties
ofhedgefunds—thebankstheydealtwith—totakeabroadlymoreconservativeapproach
with regard to credit and leverage given to the hedge funds. This in turn reduced the ability
of hedge funds to take on the large, leveraged positions they had in the past. Secondly, the
globalequityrally(i.e.bubble)in1999–2000representedacompetitivethreattothissector
ofthefinancialcommunity.Hedgefundsachievepopularitywithinvestorspreciselybecause
of their outperformance to “the market”, that is to the traditional equity and fixed income
markets. Thus, when equity markets were exploding higher in 1999, it became extremely
difficultforsometoachievethatoutperformance,particularlywhenthistookplaceatatime

Thesedeliberatelytakeassetandcurrencymarketpositionsforthespecificpurposeofadding

“wrong”inverysimplisticterms.Itgoeswithoutsayingthatonehadbetterknowwhatone
is doing if conducting such speculative activity. While adding to the company’s bottom line
is clearly a good thing—both for the company and for the Treasurer—financial markets
charge a risk premium for P&L or balance sheet volatility. This should be a consideration
whendecidingwhetherornottoallowactivespeculativeactivitywithintheTreasury,using

detail and it is certainly not for here to go through that again. However, within the overall
topic of this chapter, it is important to reiterate and make clear the point that not hedging
currency speculation equates to taking a currency view, and that in turn equates to currency
speculation.Granted,itisastretchtofitthistypeofcurrency“speculation”withinthenarrow

Theideaandtheideologyisthatcurrencyhedgingrepresentsacost,whilelossesduetonot
hedging are simply the result of unpredictable market volatility. To me, the latter represents
an abandoning, a shirking of responsibility. It is part and parcel of the job of a Treasurer or
finance director to predict their business needs. Should it not be also to predict the context

9.4.5 CurrencyOverlay

appearstoworkwell.Afterall,theveryjobofacurrencyoverlaymanageristodifferentiate
currencyriskfromunderlyingassetriskwithintheoverallriskprofile.Activecurrencyoverlay
requires that currency risk be managed separately and independently from the underlying.
Thereforedefacto,itfallswithinourdefinitionofcurrencyspeculation.Thisdoesnotmean
thatacurrencyoverlaymanagerisofnecessityanythinglikeapropdealerorahedgefund.
Thejobofacurrencyoverlaymanagermaybeeithertoensurethetotalreturnoftheportfolio

Either way, currency overlay managers use currency hedging benchmarks, as we saw in
Chapter 8. They can manage the currency risk passively by maintaining the currency risk
according to the benchmark. Alternatively, they can manage the currency risk actively by
tradingaroundthecurrencybenchmarktoaddtothetotalreturnoftheportfolio.Theformerare

who trade actively around the currency benchmark, are indeed currency speculators in that

that in a world of open capital accounts and free trade, exchange rates have to be managed
accordingtoeitherthehardestofpegsorthefreestoffree-floatingprinciples,thatanything
in between these two poles will eventually prove unsustainable. Whatever the merits of this
argument, there is little doubt that it has become the conventional exchange rate wisdom of
theday,notwithstandingtheprotestsofafewdissidentvoices.
The conventional exchange rate wisdom of the time of necessity affects the way markets

separatesanddifferentiatestheframeworkwithinwhichtheyanalysethemarket.Below,we
attempttosummarizethetypesoftechniquesandstrategieswithwhichcurrencyspeculators
approachthecurrencymarkets.
9.6.1 Macro
Thisapproachisforthemostpartidentifiedwiththeso-called“macrohedgefunds”.Broadly
speaking, “macro” or macroeconomic-based currency speculators look for market pricing
inconsistencies between the prevailing economic fundamentals and the long-term currency
valuation,withthecurrentmarketpricing.Theirraisond’eˆtreandtheirincentiveisthatcurrent
market pricing is “wrong” relative to those fundamentals and valuation, and they can earn
excessreturnsbytradingagainstthatmarketpricing.
Hereagain,thelinebetweenthecurrencyspeculatorandthe“fundamental”marketpartic-
ipantisblurred.Afterall,whereisthedifferenceintermsofincentiveandactionbetweenthe
assetmanagerwhoinvestsinacountry’sequityorfixedincomemarketsandthemacro-based
currencyspeculatorwhoinvestsinacurrencybecausetheythinkitisundervaluedrelativeto
fundamentalsandvaluation?
Itiswidelyassumedthatcurrencyspeculatorsonlytradeagainstcurrenciesratherthanin
theirfavour,butthisisveryfarfromthecase.Indeed,duringtheAsiancrisisitself,anumber
of macro hedge funds bought Asian currencies such as the Indonesian rupiah on the view
thattheyhadovershottheirfundamentalvalue—unwiselyandprematurelyasitturnedout.It
hasfrequentlybeeneasiertomakeexcessreturnsbytradingagainstcurrenciesratherthanin
theirfavourduringthe1990s,notforanymalignreasonbutsimplybecauseitwasdiscovered
thatsemi-peggedexchangerateregimeswereincompatiblewithfreeandopencapitalmarkets.
KeepingontheAsianexample,tofocusoncurrencyspeculationfororagainstAsiancurrencies
is to ignore the fact that the Asian boom became a speculative bubble that was in any case
waitingtoburst,abubblewhichtheauthoritieswereseeminglyunwillingorunabletostop.

9.6.2 Momentum(andFellowTravellers)
Momentum funds have a different trading approach as regards currency speculation. Rather
thanfocusingonapparentdisparitiesbetweentheeconomicsandtheprice,theyuseso-called
momentummodelstotriggerbuyorsellsignalsincurrencypairsirrespectiveoftheeconomics.
Granted,onecouldarguethatsinceeconomicsaffectsthepriceofthecurrency,soitalsoaffects
their models and therefore their trading approach. However, it is fair to say that economics
is not their primary focus. Their aim is to be disciplined to the extent that they rigorously
followthetradingsignalsoftheirmomentummodels.Asonemightexpect,thenatureofthese
modelsvaries.Forinstance,onesuchmomentummodelreliesontechnicalanalysisindicators

9.6.3 Flow
Itisdebatablewhetherornotmomentumtradersaretrend-followers.Thereisnodebatewhen
itcomestoflow-basedcurrencyspeculators.Theveryactofusingorderflowinformationfor
the purpose of trading in the currency markets requires that the user is following the trend
suggested by that flow data. Currency speculators who focus on flow, use that information
toanticipatethecontinuationorendofatrend.Clearly,withflowproducts,boththequality
andtherelevanceoftheflowdataarecrucialelementsindecidingwhetherornottousesuch
products as one’s primary information source for trading. There is no point in using a flow
productwheretheorderflowisneitherreflectiveofthecurrencymarketasawholenorhas
any impact on it. Flow-based currency speculators can certainly earn excess returns, but as
withothertradingapproachesdisciplineisneeded.Unlikeinthecaseofthemomentumtrader

be triggered irrespective of this important consideration. That said, the aspect of discretion
automatically increases the possibility of misinterpretation and making mistakes. As with
mosttypesoftradingorcurrencyspeculation,experiencecounts.

inordertodeterminetheirtradinginthecurrencymarkets.Again,Ihavefoundthatitsurprises

the answer of the technically-based currency speculators themselves is that markets are not
perfectlyefficient,thoughtheyarepredictabletoanextentandtechnicalanalysishelpswith
that. As discussed in Chapter 4, there are a number of schools of thought within technical

four analytical disciplines, or as a result of the risk appetite indicator. There is nothing else
to consider. “Gut feel” can earn excess returns for a period of time if you are a good and
experienced currency speculator, but it is not enough on its own. Eventually it will result in
you getting burned. The more overconfident you are, the more badly you are likely to get
burned. As regards positions, the entry, exit and stop levels should be decided by flow and

4. Long-termvaluation
10.1 CURRENCYECONOMICS
Classical economics has sought and failed to explain short-term exchange rate moves on a
consistentbasis.Currencyeconomicsisanattempttofinetuneeconomictheorytothepractical
relevance of the currency market. Broadly speaking, it seeks to analyse those aspects of the
economythatarerelevanttotheexchangeratevalue,suchas:
(cid:1)
Trendswithinthebalanceofpayments,includingthecurrentandcapitalaccounts;
(cid:1)
Theaccountingidentityforeconomicadjustment(S−I = X −M);
(cid:1)
TheRealEffectiveExchangeRate(REER)andtheexternalbalance;
(cid:1)
Relativeproductivitymeasures.
Naturally, all other aspects of the economy should be considered such as growth, inflation
and so forth, but the ones mentioned above are the key indicators relevant for our purpose
of currency analysis and strategy. Growth per se does not make a currency rise or fall on a
consistent basis. Currency market practitioners, while keeping an eye on other parts of the
economyaswell,shouldseektofocusprimarilyonthosespecificaspectsoftheeconomythat
affecttheexchangerate.

These are a very useful gauge of the market’s “skew” or bias towards an exchange rate.

predictionsastofuturespotratesbasedontheriskreversal.
10.3 TECHNICALANALYSIS
Crucial to both flow and technical analysis is the idea that financial markets are not in fact
inherently efficient and that the past can in fact impact the future. With flow analysis, one
is dealing with trends in order flow. With technical analysis, one is analysing past pricing
to make predictions about the future. At its most basic, technical analysis uses such con-
cepts as “support” and “resistance” to denote points of dynamic market tension between
supply and demand for an exchange rate, equity, bond or commodity. At a more sophis-
ticated level, technical analysis relies on patterns in mathematics to suggest they may be
reproduced in market pricing. Fibonacci, Elliott Wave and Gann analysis are examples of
these.
“Charting” remains a controversial subject for some within the financial and academic
communitieswhoappeartoregarditaslittlemorethanvoodoo.Intherealworldoftrading,
hedgingandinvestinghowever,nothingcountsexceptresults.Unlikeintheeconomicworld
where the quality of the story is seen as important, almost irrespective of its accuracy, for
traders, investors and corporations the bottom line is the bottom line. To that end, while

10.5 THESIGNALGRID
The four analytical disciplines of currency economics, flow analysis, technical analysis and
long-termvaluationwhichcometogethertomakeacurrencystrategydecisioncanbeexpressed
in the form of a signal grid, as shown in Table 9.1. To be sure, this is a very simple model.
However, what is important here is having the discipline to create it. Only when all four
analytical indicators are reading buy or sell together should one put out an official currency
strategyrecommendation.Granted,thisisstillnoguaranteeofsuccess.Itshouldhoweverhave

10.8 CURRENCYCRISESANDMODELS
10.8.1 CEMC
Most of the currency crises of the 1990s happened against soft currency pegs. In the wake
of the Asian currency crisis, I made a stab at creating a model which focused on how ex-
changeratestypicallyperformedintheruntoandafterthebreakdownofapeggedexchange
rateregime.Forgoodorill,theClassicEmergingMarketCurrencyCrisis(CEMC)modelwas
the result. To be sure, the title is a mouthful, but for the most part it tells the story of most
emergingmarketcurrencycrisesduringthe1990sandthusmayserveasausefulbarometer
shouldanysuchcrisesbeexperiencedgoingforward.Thiscanbebrokendownintofivephases
duringwhichthecurrencycrisistakesplace:
1. Capitalinflowsandrealcurrencyappreciation
2. Fundamentaldeteriorationandinevitablecurrencycollapse
3. Apositivecurrentaccountswingandaliquidity-basedrally
4. Theeconomyhitsbottom;aperiodofconsolidation
5. Thefundamentalrally
Akeyaspectofthesecriseswastherelationshipbetweentherealexchangerateandtheexternal
balance. In floating exchange rate regimes, economic imbalances are usually smoothed out
over time. In pegged exchange rate regimes, they can build up to unsustainable levels, thus
forcing the collapse of the exchange rate peg, if not checked by changes in macroeconomic
policy.
10.8.2 TheSpeculativeCycle
While CEMC focuses specifically on pegged exchange rates, the “speculative cycle” model
focusesinsteadonfreelyfloatingexchanges.Thismodelconsistsoffourphases,describing
therelationshipbetween“fundamental”and“speculative”forceswithinthemarketsandthe

10.9 MANAGINGCURRENCYRISKI—THECORPORATION
10.9.1 TypesofCurrencyRisk
Forcorporations,therearethreekeykindsofcurrencyrisktheyhavetomanage.Theyare:
1. Transactionalrisk(receivables,dividends,etc.)
2. Translationalrisk(balancesheet)
3. Economicrisk(presentvalueoffutureoperatingcashflows)

198 CurrencyStrategy
Transactionalriskorexposureisessentiallycashflowrisk.Translationalrisk,foritspart,results
from the consolidation of group and subsidiary balance sheets, and deals with the exposure
representedbyforeigninvestmentanddebtstructure.Economicriskisanoverallmeasureof
thecurrencyriskofthecorporation,focusingonthepresentvalueoffutureoperatingcashflows
andhowthispresentvalueinthebasecurrencychangesasaresultofchangesinexchangerates.
Overthelongterm,however,exchangeratesadjustthroughtheconceptofPPP,dependingon
relative inflation and domestic price levels. Thus, theoretically, a corporation whose foreign
subsidiaries experience price inflation in line with the general level of inflation should be
returned to its original value through an adjustment in the exchange rate exactly according
to the PPP concept. In such circumstances, one might argue that economic risk or exposure
is irrelevant. However, corporations rarely experience cost inflation exactly in line with the
generallevelofinflation.Therefore,economicriskdoesmatter.Thebestwayofdealingwith
thisistofinanceoperationsinthecurrencytowhichthefirm’svalueissensitive.

10.10.1 AbsoluteReturns:RiskReduction
Just as a corporation has to decide whether to run their Treasury operation as a profit or as
a loss reducing centre, so a portfolio manager has to make the same choice in the approach
theytaketomanagingcurrencyrisk.Ifaportfoliomanagerisfocusedonmaximizingabsolute
returns, the emphasis in managing their currency risk is likely to be on risk reduction. In
ordertoachievethis,theywillmostlikelyadoptastrategyofpassivecurrencymanagement.

10.10.2 SelectingtheCurrencyHedgingBenchmark

10.10.7 OptimizationoftheCarryTrade
As with corporations, institutional investors can use optimization techniques. With corpora-
tions, the aim is to achieve the cheapest hedge for the most risk hedged. In the case of the
investor,theaimhereistoaddalphabyimprovingonthesimplecarrytrade.Theideabehind
thecarrytradeitselfisthat,usingariskappetiteindicator,thecurrencymanagergoeslonga
basketofhighcarrycurrencies,whenriskappetitereadingsareeitherstrongorneutral,and
conversely goes short that basket of currencies when risk appetite readings go into negative
territory.
It is possible to fine tune or optimize this strategy to take account of the volatility and
correlation of currencies in addition to their yield differentials. This should produce better
returns than the simple carry trade strategy. The optimized carry trade hedges the currency
pairsaccordingtotheweightsprovidedbythemean–varianceoptimizationratherthansimply

10.11 MANAGINGCURRENCYRISKIII—THESPECULATOR
Iftheideaofcurrencyhedgingiscontroversialtosome,thenthatofcurrencyspeculationiseven
moreso.Currencyspeculation—thatisthetradingofcurrencieswithnounderlying,attached
asset—makesupthevastmajorityofcurrencymarketflow.Giventhatthecurrencymarket
provides the liquidity for global trade and investment, it is therefore currency speculation
thatisprovidingthisliquidity.Whenlookingattheissueofcurrencyspeculation,oneshould
immediately dispense with such descriptions of it being a “good” or a “bad” influence and
instead focus on what it provides. It is neither a benign nor a malign force. Rather, its sole
purpose is to make money. Furthermore, it does not act in a vacuum, but instead represents
themarket’sresponsetoperceivedfundamentalchanges.Thus,itisasymptomratherthanthe

Example
On January 10, 2002, I released a strategy note, recommending clients to sell the US dollar
against the Turkish lira, via a one-month forward outright contract. For the past couple of
months,wehadbeentakingamorepositiveandconstructiveviewontheTurkishlira,inline
with the price action and more positive fundamental and technical developments. Thus, we
cametotheconclusionthatwhiletheTurkishliraremainedavolatilecurrency,itwastrending

Fromafundamentalperspective,weatthetimetookaconstructiveviewonTurkey’s2002eco-

haddevaluedandde-peggedinFebruaryof2001andsincethenhadfallensubstantiallyfrom

in the lira’s value had severe consequences for the economy, triggering a dramatic spike in
inflation.Indeed,inthethirdquarterof2001,currencyweaknessandrisinginflationappeared

suggests. In January 2002, what we were witnessing was a classic liquidity-driven rally in
a currency which had hit its low after breaking its peg the previous year. This phenomenon
wasfarfromuniquetotheTurkishlira.ExactlythesamephenomenonwasseenintheAsian
currenciesaftertheircrisisin1997–1998,andtosomeextentalsointheRussianroubleand
Brazilianreal.
Inadditiontosucheconomicconsiderations,favourablepoliticalconsiderationswerealso
animportantfactor,keepingTurkeyfinanciallywellsupported,particularlyinthewakeofthe
successfulpassageofsuchimportantlegislationasthetobaccoandpublicprocurementlaws.
Strong official support for Turkey at the end of 2001 appeared to make 2002 financing and
rolloverslookmanageable.Finally,“dollarization”levels—thatisthedegreetowhichTurkish
depositholderswerechangingoutofliraandintoUSdollars—appearedtohavepeakedin
November2001,aftersoaringinitiallyinthewakeofthelira’sdevaluationinFebruary2001.
In our view, if the 1994 devaluation was any guide, this process of de-dollarization may
have been only in its early stages. Granted, any positive view on the Turkish lira still had
to be tempered with some degree of caution about the underlying risks. Any proliferation
of the anti-terrorism campaign to Iraq and/or renewed domestic political squabbling would
clearly have the potential to upset markets, as would any hint of delay in global recovery
prospects.
Therewasalsothe“technical”angletoconsider.DespitethefactthattheTurkishlirahad
been a floating currency for only a relatively small period of time, the dollar–Turkish lira
exchangerateappearedtotradeincreasinglytechnically,inlinewithsuchtechnicalindicators
asmovingaveragesthroughSeptemberandOctoberof2001.Indeed,inNovemberof2001,
dollar–Turkish lira broke down through the 55-day moving average at 1.479 million for the

Figure10.1).Thenecklineofthatheadandshoulderspatterncameinaround1.350million,
whichwaswhyweputouttargetthere.SuchtechnicalindicatorsasRSIandslowstochastics
werealsopointinglowerfordollar–Turkishlira.
In sum, both fundamentals, technicals and the CEMC model all seemed aligned at the
time for further Turkish lira outperformance. Looking at the dollar–Turkish lira exchange
rate through the signal grid, we would have come up with the results in Table 10.1. While
recommendationscanbemadeonthebasisofonlyoneoutofthefoursignals,theyareclearly
morepowerful—andmorelikelytoberight—ifallfoursignalsareinline.

10.12.2 CurrencyHedging
Foritspart,thissectionshouldbethefocusofpassivecurrencymanagersandcorporations.Here
too,thedisciplineofhowoneputstogetheracurrencystrategyisthesame,thoughthepurpose
is different. The currency market practitioner has to form a currency view. That view can
comefromthebankcounterpartiesthatthecorporationorassetmanageruses,butthecurrency
market practitioner should also have a currency view themselves, with which to compare
against such external views. The view itself is created from the signal grid, incorporating
currencyeconomics,technicals,flowanalysisandlong-termvaluation.Thecurrencymarket
practitioner should be aware of all these aspects of the currency to which they are exposed.
Not being aware is the equivalent of not knowing the business you are in. In the example I
havechosen,wekeepthefocusonemergingmarketcurrencies,thistimelookingattherisk
posedbyexposuretocurrencyriskinthecountriesofCentralandEasternEurope.

respecttobothhopesandexpectations.
This has been extremely important for UK, US and European corporations with factories
or operations in Central and Eastern Europe. The reasons for this are simple—just as the
EurohasbeenweakagainsttheUSdollaroverthepasttwotothreeyears,soithasalsobeen
simultaneouslyweakagainstthecurrenciesofCentralandEasternEurope.Indeed,thereisa

aheadofEUaccessionandultimatelyadoptingtheEuro.Thepullforconvergencehasbeen
irresistible. Substantial portfolio and direct investment inflows to CEE countries, combined
with broad Euro weakness, has meant that the Euro has weakened substantially against the
likes of the Czech koruna, Polish zloty, Slovak koruna and also the Hungarian forint, after
Hungary’sde-pegginginMay2001,intheperiod2000–2002.

The line between currency trading and currency hedging blurs when it comes to active
currencymanagerswhotradearoundacurrencyhedgingbenchmark.Thedifferencebetween
the two clearly comes down to incentive, and also to whether one is targeting absolute or
relative returns. Active currency managers also hedge currency risk, either on a rigorous
basisrelativetoacurrencyhedgingbenchmarkoronapurelydiscretionarybasis.Withinthe
emerging markets, dedicated emerging market funds may have a currency overlay manager
who hedges/trades relative to a currency hedging benchmark. On the other hand, G7 funds
that allocate 2–3% of their portfolio to the emerging markets are unlikely to have a specific
currencyhedgingbenchmarkforsuchasmallallocation,andareonlylikelytohedgecurrency
riskonadiscretionarybasis.Thesuggestionhereisthatbothcoulddosomoreeffectivelyand

answertothepuzzleofpredictingexchangerates,butareafraidtoadmitit.Indeed,thevery
success of such analytical disciplines as flow and technical analysis suggests serious flaws,
both in the idea of exchange rates obeying a random walk and in the idea of markets being
perfectly efficient. Both capital flow analysis and “charting” have added significantly to the
professionofcurrencystrategy,notleastinitsabilitytodeliverresults—andhereinliesthekey.
The arguments against the likes of flow and technical analysis are usually emotionally—or
ideologically—ratherthanempiricallybased.No-onehasactuallyproventhatflowortechnical

Thefocusofthecurrencystrategist,andinturnthecurrencymarketpractitioner,shouldbe
purely practical. This is a business and a business has to achieve measurable results. If that
business is to succeed, its results have to outperform consistently. While there are no guar-
antees—andcertainlynotwithregardtoexchangerates—adoptinganintegratedapproach
tocurrencyanalysis,incorporatingcurrencyeconomics,flowanalysis,technicalanalysisand

theoretical money on the line. On the very first day I joined the bank in 1998 as the Asian
crisis continued to flare, I was asked by the Finance Director of a multinational corporation
whethertheyshouldhedgetheirexposuretotheHongKongdollarandwouldthepeg“go”?My

second, I said that the peg would remain in place because of the solid foundations of Hong
Kong’scurrencyboardsystemandthedeterminationoftheHongKongMonetaryAuthority
tokeepitinplace.Nowadays,thismightseemlikestatingtheobvious,butatthetimethere
was real fear in the market that Hong Kong’s “peg” might break, as was the case for Asian
currencypegsduringtheAsiancurrencycrisis.Imentionthisexampleneitherforthepurpose

Of course, the Finance Director will have had his own informed view of the risks involved
in the corporation’s specific exposure to the Hong Kong dollar. At the time, he most likely
wantedanoutsider’sview,eithertoconfirmortoquestionhisownview.Thatoutsider’sview

are now seen as plain vanilla relative to the increasingly tailored needs of currency market
practitioners—and moreover are increasingly being demanded by local market participants

Conclusion 213
giventhepracticalconsiderationsofspaceandtime,belefttotheprospectofasecondedition
ofthisbook.
Toconclude,the“problem”withtryingtoanalyse,forecast,hedge,tradeandinvestinthe
currency markets is that currencies are affected by so many factors simultaneously—and
to complicate matters further the importance of those factors may change over time—so
it is difficult to tell the combined impact of the sum of these factors. To date, none of the
traditionalexchangeratemodelshavebeenabletoincorporateallofthepossiblefactorsthat
might impact exchange rates to the extent that they are then able to predict exchange rates
on a consistent basis over a short-term time horizon. Given the number of possible factors
involved, this is hardly surprising. The changeability of the importance of these factors is a
furthercomplication.Forinstance,in2001akeyfactoraffectingexchangerateswasforeign
directinvestmentorFDI.Indeed,in2001thetopthreecurrenciesintheworldagainsttheUS
dollar—theMexicanpeso,PeruviansolandPolishzloty—werealltherecipientofmajorFDI

Within the developed markets, FDI inflows have played an important though changing role
intheperformanceoftheUSdollar.In2000,theUSwastherecipientofhugeFDIinflows,
whichinturnwasseenasamajorcontributingfactorforUSdollarstrength.FDIinflowsslowed

dollarremainedrelativelystrongastheshortfallinFDIinflowswasmadeupforbyportfolio
inflows,whichinturnhelpedfinancethecurrentaccountdeficit.Thedangerinsettingrules
abouthowcapitalshouldflowtocountrieswiththehighestnominalorrealinterestrateswas
also apparent in 2001. In that year, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates 11 times, bringing
theFederalfunds’targetratedownfrom6.50%to1.75%,whiletheEuropeanCentralBank
onlycutitsrefinancingratefrom4.50%to3.25%.Inotherwords,thedifferencebetweenthe
FedfundsrateandtheECB’srefinancingratewentfrom+200to−150bp.Despitethat,the
Euro was still unable to rally on a sustained basis. Relative growth patterns, which at times
have been a key driver of the Euro–dollar exchange rate, were also not the main answer. In
late 2000 and 2001, US industrial production contracted for the longest consecutive period
sinceJuly1932,ortheGreatDepression.Intheend,themarketcametotheviewthatfinancial
markets rewarded aggressive growth-oriented monetary policy, such as that adopted by the
FederalReserve,intheformofportfolioinflows.Allthatonecansayaboutthisisthatsuch
marketfavouritismhasnotalwaysbeenthecaseinthepastandisunlikelytoalwaysbethe
casegoingforward.Indeed,inthefuture,theremaywellbeotherfactorsthatsurpassthisin
termsoftheirimpactontheexchangerate.
The discipline of trying to analyse and forecast exchange rates continues to require great
flexibility.Ifanyexchangeratemodelwereabletosuccessfullyincorporateallmajorfactorsto
produceconsistentlyaccurateexchangerateforecasts,itwouldsurelybeworthyoftheNobel
Prize for Economics. For now, the best answer for currency market practitioners remains to
adoptanintegratedapproachtocurrencyanalysisandstrategy,involvingthefourdisciplines
ofcurrencyeconomics,flowanalysis,technicalanalysisandlong-termvaluationbasedonthe
traditionalexchangeratemodels.
Finally, it should not be forgotten that, despite the increase in global trade flows and the
